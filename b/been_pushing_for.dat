5|$|The British Government {{called on}} Keynes's {{expertise}} during the First World War. While {{he did not}} formally re-join the civil service in 1914, Keynes travelled to London at the government's request {{a few days before}} hostilities started. Bankers had <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> the suspension of specie payments – the convertibility of banknotes into gold – but with Keynes's help the Chancellor of the Exchequer (then Lloyd George) was persuaded {{that this would be a}} bad idea, as it would hurt the future reputation of the city if payments were suspended before it was absolutely necessary.|$|E
5|$|The last plank in Patton's {{education}} platform was {{the improvement}} of adult education. This issue allowed him {{to work with a}} political foe, Republican senator David L. Williams, who had <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> additional resources for adult education since 1997. In 1998, Patton personally chaired a task force on adult education, and 18months later, the task force's recommendations were incorporated into a bill sponsored by Williams. The bill, which increased and equalized funding and tied continuing funds to successful performance by individual adult-education programs, passed both houses of the General Assembly unanimously. By 2003, the number of adults completing their GED rose by 17percent, and the number of GED recipients who matriculated to college rose from 13percent to 18percent.|$|E
5|$|Throughout July 1944, Goebbels and Speer {{continued}} to press Hitler {{to bring the}} economy to a total war footing. The 20 July plot, where Hitler was almost killed by a bomb at his field headquarters in East Prussia, played {{into the hands of}} those who had <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> change: Bormann, Goebbels, Himmler, and Speer. Over the objections of Göring, Goebbels was appointed on 23 July as Reich Plenipotentiary for Total War, charged with maximising the manpower for the Wehrmacht and the armaments industry at the expense of sectors of the economy not critical to the war effort. Through these efforts, he was able to free up an additional half a million men for military service. However, as many of these new recruits came from the armaments industry, the move put him in conflict with armaments minister Speer. Untrained workers from elsewhere were not readily absorbed into the armaments industry, and likewise the new Wehrmacht recruits waited in barracks for their turn to be trained.|$|E

Trafford Leigh-Mallory, Bader's immediate superior as OC No. 11 Group, Fighter Command, relented and allowed Bader to continue frequent missions over France even though his score of 20 and the accompanying strain evident on his features obliged Leigh-Mallory to consider his withdrawal from operations. Ultimately, Leigh-Mallory {{did not want to}} upset his star pilot, and did not invoke any restrictions.|$|E

The US argued that India's strong nuclear non-proliferation record made it an exception, however this has not persuaded other Nuclear Suppliers Group members to sign similar deals with India. During a state visit to India in November 2010, US president Barack Obama announced US support for India's bid for permanent membership to UN Security Council as well as India's entry to Nuclear Suppliers Group, Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia Group and Missile Technology Control Regime.|$|E

25|$|At a site just to {{the east}} of the Old Oak Common site, Kensington and Chelsea Council has <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> a station at North Kensington / Kensal off Ladbroke Grove & Canal Way, as a {{turn-back}} facility will have to be built in the area anyway. Siting it at Kensal Rise, rather than next to Paddington itself, would provide a new station to regenerate the area. Amongst the general public there is a huge amount of support for the project and Mayor Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it did not increase Crossrail's overall cost; in response, Kensington and Chelsea Council agreed to underwrite the projected £33million cost of a Crossrail station, which was received very well by the residents of the Borough. TfL is conducting a feasibility study on the station and the project is backed by National Grid, retailers Sainsbury's and Cath Kidston, and Jenny Jones (Green Party member of the London Assembly).|$|E
25|$|Scott Stadium {{sits across}} from the first-year dorms along Alderman Road and {{is home to the}} University of Virginia's {{football}} program. The press box at Scott Stadium was a gift from an alumnus in honor of Norton G. Pritchett, the admired athletic director at UVA from 1934 until his death in 1950. Students, fans and alumni began to sport orange clothing for the games, a new tradition the former head coach, Al Groh, had <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> since he became head coach in 2000. Many students, however, have continued to wear the traditional sundresses or coats and ties at football games. Several fans have also begun garbing themselves in outlandish costumes in the style of football superfans (such as the Orange Gorilla or The Superhoo). Funding from benefactor Carl Smith created the foundation for the 280-piece Cavalier Marching Band in 2004, replacing the Virginia Pep Band in its official capacity at athletic events. The current head coach is Bronco Mendenhall, former head coach at BYU, who replaced Mike London in December 2015.|$|E
25|$|Bathurst {{would prove}} to be a {{disaster}} for the team. In the race, the British built Commodore with Tom Walkinshaw driving lasted only 5 laps before retiring with rear suspension failure after a pit stop where the left rear wheel changer was lucky not to be seriously injured when the car was let off its onboard air jacks too early. The Perkins/Hulme car qualified inside the top 10 (the only V8 to do so) and ran strongly in second or third place for most of the race until engine failure on lap 137. However, the real drama started at the end of official qualifying when Walkinshaw put in a protest against the fastest Sierra's (only the Australian built examples). This was counter protested by Dick Johnson Racing team manager Neal Lowe (who had taken over Perkins old role as race engineer/driver at the HDT in 1986) who protested all three HSV team cars. While the Sierra's were all eventually cleared, two of the three HSV team cars, the two built by Perkins in Australia, were found to have illegal modifications to the Commodore's steering rack and were disqualified, though as one car had been withdrawn before qualifying and the Perkins/Hulme/Walkinshaw race car had failed to finish (Walkinshaw invoked a clause in the teams contract which forced a reluctant Perkins to let him drive the car in the race), the race results were not altered to show the disqualification. The DQ of the Perkins built cars raised some eyebrows from his fellow competitors as Larry had been vocal throughout the 1988 ATCC about the legality of the Sierra's and had <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> the Confederation of Australian Motor Sport to enforce Group A rules.|$|E

The episode was {{directed}} by Larry Leichliter. The idea to create an episode based on a shared history between Marceline and the Ice King was Ward's idea. Sugar had also <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> a Marceline and Ice King musical episode. Sugar was responsible for designing Marceline's look in the episode. According to her, the shirt that Marceline wears was [...] "loosely based off a stretched out old D.A.R.E. shirt." [...] The original working title for the episode was [...] "Help". Former storyboard artist and creative director for the series Adam Muto joked that the change was made due to the famous Beatles song of the same name.|$|E
500|$|Lawyers and {{academics}} had <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> reform {{of this area}} of law since at least 1982, when the Law Commission published a report advising reform of the rules over trustees delegating their powers to other people. Other trusts reform came about through the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996, but this did not cover most of trusts law. Although there were some other small changes (such as a 1996 Statutory Instrument that extended the rights of trustees under the Trustee Investments Act 1961) little else was done. Further papers were published on similar areas in 1997 and 1999, and finally the Trustee Bill 2000 {{was introduced to the}} House of Lords in January 2000, implementing the proposals laid out in the Law Commission's 1999 report [...] "Trustees' Powers and Duties". The Act was given the Royal Assent on 23 November 2000, and most of it came into effect on 1 February 2001 through the Trustee Act 2000 (Commencement) Order 2001.|$|E
500|$|As {{the game}} neared completion, FormGen {{contacted}} id with concerns over its violence and shock content. In response, id increased these aspects; Adrian Carmack added skeletons, corpses, and bloody wall details, and Hall and Romero added screams and cries in German, {{along with a}} Death Cam that would show a replay {{of the death of}} the final boss of an episode. The team also added [...] "Horst-Wessel-Lied", the anthem of the Nazi Party, to the opening screen. John Carmack, meanwhile, added in walls that moved when triggered to hide secret areas, a feature that Hall had <b>been</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>for</b> months but which Carmack had objected to for technical reasons. Hall also added in cheat codes, and wrote a back story for the game. In the early morning of May 5, 1992, the first episode of the shareware game was completed and uploaded by Apogee and id to bulletin board systems. The other episodes were completed a few weeks later. The total development time had been around half a year, with a cost of around US$25,000 to cover the team's rent and US$750 per month salaries.|$|E
