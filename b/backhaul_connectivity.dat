Consequently, this will enable provision of high-speed mobile data and telecommunications services. This paper describes how WiMAX and WiFi can be merged together, with VSAT technology offering <b>backhaul</b> internet <b>connectivity</b> to provide ever present broadband access.

50|$|Generally, {{backhaul}} solutions can largely be categorised into wired (leased {{lines or}} copper/fibre) or wireless (point-to-point, point-to-multipoint over high-capacity radio links). Wired {{is usually a}} very expensive solution and often impossible to deploy in remote areas, hence making wireless a more suitable and/or a viable option. Multi-hop wireless architecture can overcome the hurdles of wired solutions to create efficient large coverage areas and with growing demand in emerging markets where often cost {{is a major factor}} in deciding technologies, a wireless backhaul solution is able to offer 'carrier-grade' services, whereas this is not easily feasible with wired <b>backhaul</b> <b>connectivity.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of the}} Portable Wireless LAN trial {{programme}} by JANET, {{under which}} this work is being carried out, is twofold.

40|$|Multicast routing is {{a crucial}} issue in {{wireless}} networks in which the same content should be delivered {{to a group of}} recipients simultaneously. Multicast is also considered as a key service for audio and video applications as well as data dissemination protocols over the last-mile <b>backhaul</b> Internet <b>connectivity</b> provided by multi-channel multi-radio wireless mesh networks (MCMR WMNs). The multicast problem is essentially related to a channel assignment strategy which determines the most suitable channel-radio associations. However, channel assignment brings about its own complications and hence, solving the multicast problem in MCMR WMNs will be more complicated than that of traditional networks. This problem has been proved to be NP-hard. In the major prior art multicast protocols developed for these networks, channel assignment and multicast routing are considered as two separate sub-problems to be solved sequentially. The work in this article is targeted at promoting the adoption of learning automata for joint channel assignment and multicast routing problem in MCMR WMNs. In the proposed scheme named LAMR, contrary to the existing methods, these two sub-problems will be solved conjointly. Experimental results demonstrate that LAMR outperforms the LCA and MCM proposed by Zeng et al.

40|$|One of {{the major}} impediments to {{providing}} broadband connectivity in semi-urban and rural India {{is the lack of}} robust and affordable <b>backhaul.</b> Fiber <b>connectivity</b> in terms of backhaul that is being planned (or provided) by the Government of India would reach only till rural offices (named Gram Panchayat) in the Indian rural areas. In this exposition, we articulate how TV white space can address the challenge in providing broadband connectivity to a billion plus population within India. The villages can form local Wi-Fi clusters. The problem of connecting the Wi-Fi clusters to the optical fiber points can be addressed using a TV white space based backhaul (middle-mile) network. The amount of TV white space present in India is very large when compared with the developed world. Therefore, we discuss a backhaul architecture for rural India, which utilizes TV white spaces. We also showcase results from our TV white space testbed, which support the effectiveness of backhaul by using TV white spaces. Our testbed provides a broadband access network to rural population in thirteen villages. The testbed is deployed over an area of $ 25 $km$^ 2 $, and extends seamless broadband connectivity from optical fiber locations or Internet gateways to remote (difficult to connect) rural regions. We also discuss standards and TV white space regulations, which are pertinent to the backhaul architecture mentioned above.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{networks}} (HetNets) {{have been}} considered as a promising architecture for upcoming 5 G networks due to their high energy and spectrum efficiency. However, providing <b>backhaul</b> <b>connectivity</b> for all macro and pico base stations (BSs) in HetNets constitutes a significant share of infrastructure cost. Recently, the idea of flexible backhaul has drown {{a lot of attention}} both from industry and academia. Under this architecture, not all the pico BSs are connected to the backhaul, resulting in a significant reduction in the infrastructure costs. In this regard, pico BSs without <b>backhaul</b> <b>connectivity</b> need to communicate with their nearby BSs in order to have indirect accessibility to the backhaul. This makes the radio resource management (RRM) in such networks more complex and challenging. In this paper, we address the problem of cross-layer RRM in HetNets with flexible backhaul. We formulate the RRM problem as a two timescale non-convex stochastic optimization problem which jointly optimizes flow control, routing control, interference mitigation and link scheduling in order to maximize a generic network utility. By exploiting the hidden convexity of this non-convex problem, we propose an iterative algorithm which is converges to the global optimal solution. The proposed solution has low complexity and requires low signalling and message passing among different nodes, which makes it scalable. Moreover, due to the proposed two-timescale design, it is robust to the backhaul signalling latency as well. Simulation results demonstrate the significant performance gain of the proposed solution over various baselines...|$|E

Multicast is also deemed a key enabling service for a wealth of audio and video applications as well as data dissemination protocols over the last-mile <b>backhaul</b> Internet <b>connectivity</b> provided by Multi-Channel Multi-Radio Wireless Mesh Networks (MCMR WMNs). Major prior art multicast protocols in these networks center around heuristic or metaheuristic initiatives in which channel assignment and multicast routing are considered as two separate sub-problems to be solved in sequence. It might even be the cast that the solution for either of these two sub-problems is assumed to be preparatively calculated and given as input to the other. Within this perspective, however, the interplay between the two sub-problems would essentially be ruled out of the computations, resulting in sub-optimal solutions for network configuration. The work in this article is targeted at promoting the adoption of cross-layer design for joint channel assignment and multicast tree construction problem in MCMR WMNs. In the proposed scheme, contrary to the existing methods, these two sub-problems will be solved conjointly and an optimal solution is provided.

40|$|The {{deluge of}} date rate in today's {{networks}} poses a cost {{burden on the}} backhaul network design. Developing cost efficient backhaul solutions becomes an interesting, yet challenging, problem. Traditional technologies for backhaul networks include either radio-frequency backhauls (RF) or optical fibres (OF). While RF is a cost-effective solution as compared to OF, it supports lower data rate requirements. Another promising backhaul solution that may combine both a high data rate and a relatively low cost is the free-space optics (FSO). FSO, however, is sensitive to nature conditions (e. g., rain, fog, line-ofsight, etc.). A more reliable alternative is, therefore, to combine RF and FSO solutions through a hybrid structure called hybrid RF/FSO. Consider a backhaul network, where the base-stations (BS) can be connected to each other either via OF or hybrid RF/FSO backhaul links. The paper addresses the problem of minimizing the cost of <b>backhaul</b> planning under <b>connectivity</b> and data rates constraints, so as to choose the appropriate costeffective backhaul type between BSs (i. e., either OF or hybrid RF/FSO). The paper solves the problem using graph theory techniques by introducing the corresponding planning graph.

40|$|As radio {{technologies}} and public policies evolve, an increasing amount of spectrum is being {{set aside for}} transmission use without a license. These license-exempt, or "unlicensed" bands, include 2. 4 GHz and 5 GHz in the USA and much of Europe. I argue that this unlicensed spectrum, and low-cost wireless technologies that operate in these bands, is of particular value in the developing world, where {{it has the potential}} to substantially impact accessibility and availability of information and telecommunication services. In the context of numerous institutional and structural obstacles to entry license-exempt regulation potentially provides a friendly environment for entrepreneurship, reducing barriers to entry and the risk of regulatory capture. In order to assess this opportunity in the context of Africa, I have surveyed every country in the continent on their regulations and use of the 2. 4 and 5 GHz bands. Responses, from differing country informants though mostly from the regulators themselves, were received from 47 of the 54 countries of Africa, which accounts for 95 % of the continent's population. The responses show that there is significant diversity and heterogeneity in the regulation of these bands across Africa. Not only do licensing requirements and specific conditions change widely from country to country, but so do power, range and services restrictions, as well as certification requirements. In addition, regulation is still not in place in some countries, and is changing in others. Enforcement is low, adding to overall uncertainty. Lack of clarity in regulation and enforcement creates confusion and may discourage smaller players from entering the market. For bigger players interested in taking advantage of economies of scale(cont.) and implementing common strategies across borders, the heterogeneous regulatory environment will also act as a deterrent and a barrier to entry. Despite this heterogeneity, these bands are being used in most African countries, not only for "hotspot" style or other localized coverage in urban areas, but also for longer area coverage. A significant 37 % of the countries that responded are using wireless technologies operating in these bands for providing <b>backhaul</b> network <b>connectivity</b> in rural areas. In unlicensed bands regulation tends to place a burden on the transmitter though, e. g. through power restrictions, in particular where competition in the market is low. In view of the continent's weak teledensity and lack of alternative infrastructure, establishing a more certain and uniform regulatory framework and promoting an appropriate business climate across Africa may be instrumental in encouraging private investment and connectivity through technology in these bands. The TU may have a key role to play, both by issuing clearer guidelines for the regulation of license-exempt bands, and by serving as a convening forum for countries to establish common regulatory strategies. While a fair balance is needed in regulation, this thesis argues that governments should err on the side of laxity in order to lower barriers to entry and counterbalance current overregulation of these bands. by Maria Isabel A.

AT&T has also announced the deployment of more than 40, 000 outdoor small cells (i.e., metrocells) by the end of 2015 [6]. However, despite their benefits, in order to roll-out a large number of small cells, operators must still face the challenge of backhauling the network traffic from small cell BSs to the core network. Indeed, a recent survey [6] showed that around 56 % of operators consider backhaul {{as one of the greatest}} challenges in future cellular communications. This is mainly because most of small cell BSs do not always have access to wired <b>backhaul</b> <b>connectivity</b> and because today the cost of the wireless backhaul equipment exceeds the cost of the small cell BS itself.|$|E
