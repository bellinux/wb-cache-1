5000|$|In {{the field}} of {{electric}} power distribution and transmission, a <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay</b> is a safety device mounted on some oil-filled power transformers and reactors, equipped with an external overhead oil reservoir called a [...] "conservator". The <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay</b> {{is used as a}} protective device sensitive to the effects of dielectric failure inside the equipment. A generic designation for this type of device is [...] "gas detector relay".|$|E

50|$|Through a {{connected}} {{gas sampling}} device the control {{can also be}} made from the ground. Depending on the requirements, the <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay</b> has a flange or threaded connection. The classic <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay</b> has {{to comply with the}} requirements of the DIN EN 50216-2 standard. Depending on the requirements, it is equipped with up to four (2 per float) switches or change-over switches, which can either send a light signal or switch off the transformer.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Buchholz</b> <b>relays</b> {{have been}} applied on {{oil-filled}} power and distribution transformers {{at least since the}} 1940s. The relay is connected to the oil piping between the conservator and oil tank of a transformer. The piping between the main tank and conservator is arranged so that any gas evolved in the main tank tends to flow upward toward the conservator and gas detector relay.|$|R
5000|$|If an {{electrical}} arc forms, gas accumulation is rapid, and oil flows rapidly into the conservator. This flow of oil operates a switch {{attached to a}} vane located {{in the path of}} the moving oil. This switch normally will operate a circuit breaker to isolate the apparatus before the fault causes additional damage. <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relays</b> have a test port to allow the accumulated gas to be withdrawn for testing. Flammable gas found in the relay indicates some internal fault such as overheating or arcing, whereas air found in the relay may only indicate low oil level or a leak.|$|R
50|$|Oil filled {{transformers}} with a conservator (oil reservoir) {{may have}} a gas detector relay (<b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay).</b> These safety devices detect the buildup of gas inside the transformer due to corona discharge, overheating, or an internal electric arc. On a slow accumulation of gas, or rapid pressure rise, these devices can trip a protective circuit breaker to remove power from the transformer. Transformers without conservators are usually equipped with sudden pressure relays, which perform a similar function as the <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay.</b>|$|E

50|$|A <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay</b> is {{a safety}} device sensing the {{accumulation}} of gas in large oil-filled transformers, which will alarm on slow accumulation of gas or shut down the transformer if gas is produced rapidly in the transformer oil. The contacts are not operated by an electric current but by the pressure of accumulated gas or oil flow.|$|E
50|$|The {{transformer}} {{was also}} {{protected by a}} <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay</b> which monitored any gas build-up within the cooling/insulating oil, as the acetylene (ethyne) gas generated is highly explosive. All Class 302 and 308 stock were fitted with Stone Faiveley pantographs for current collection from the overhead line. A particular oddity of Eastern/Anglian region EMU stock was the fitting of fibre glass snow shields between the pantograph and the supporting insulators.|$|E
50|$|The tank {{of liquid}} filled {{transformers}} often has radiators {{through which the}} liquid coolant circulates by natural convection or fins. Some large transformers employ electric fans for forced-air cooling, pumps for forced-liquid cooling, or have heat exchangers for water-cooling. An oil-immersed transformer may be equipped with a <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay,</b> which, depending on severity of gas accumulation due to internal arcing, is used to either alarm or de-energize the transformer. Oil-immersed transformer installations usually include fire protection measures such as walls, oil containment, and fire-suppression sprinkler systems.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A power {{transformer}} {{is a very}} valuable and an important link in power transmission system. It provides voltage transformation and power transfer. Faults occur in transformer due to insulation breakdown, aging of insulation, overheating due to over-excitation, oil contamination and reduced cooling.

40|$|Abstract Transformer fault {{diagnosis}} and repair {{is a complex}} task that includes many possible types of faults and demands special trained personnel. Moreover, the minimization of the time needed for transformer {{fault diagnosis}} and repair is an important task for electric utilities, especially {{in cases where the}} continuity of supply is crucial. In this paper, Stochastic Petri Nets are used for the simulation of the fault diagnosis process of oil-immersed transformers and the definition of the actions followed to repair the transformer. Transformer fault detection is realized using an integrated safety detector, in case of sealed type transformer that is completely filled with oil, while a <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay</b> and an oil thermometer are used, in case of transformer with conservator tank. Simulation results for the most common types of transformer faults (overloading, oil leakage, short-circuit and insulation failure) are presented. The proposed Stochastic Petri Net based methodology provides a systematical determination of the sequence of fault diagnosis and repair actions and aims at identifying the transformer fault and estimating the duration for transformer repair...|$|E
40|$|Power {{transformer}} is a {{major component}} of power system and it’s correct functioning is vital to system operations. It is quite expensive and has no substitute for it’s major role. It is therefore, very important to closely monitor the in-service behavior to avoid costly outages and loss of production. Many devices such as <b>Buchholz</b> <b>relay</b> and Differential relay have been evolved to monitor serviceability of power transformer. However, they respond only to severe power failure requiring immediate removal of transformer from service. Thus, preventive techniques for early detection of faults to avoid costly outages would be valuable. Of all the techniques used for assessing the health of oil filled transformer, none can match the serviceability and reliability of Dissolved Gas Analysis (DGA). Many interpretative methods such as Rogers, Dornerburg and IEC PU 599 based on DGA to diagnose the nature of incipient deterioration have been reported. One drawback of all these methods in its present form is that a significant number of DGA results in service fall outside the proposed codes and cannot be diagnosed by these methods. To overcome this limitation, a prototype of an expert system based on DGA for diagnosis of suspected transformer fault and their maintenance action is proposed in this paper. An attempt is also made to fill the void by expansion of ratio combinations in the ratio method IEC PU 599 so that all practical cases can be dealt with. This expert system is implemented into PC by using ‘ Turbo Prolog ’ with rule based knowledge representations. The designed expert system has been tested for about ten years collection of CPRI, BHEL and NTPC (India) transformer gas ratio records to show its effectiveness in transformer diagnosis...|$|E
