40|$|Objective. The {{development}} of light-emitting <b>bipolar</b> <b>semiconductor</b> structures having {{a low level}} of parasitic heat release. Methods. A method for converting thermoelectric heat in <b>bipolar</b> <b>semiconductor</b> structures into optical radiation to divert the excess energy into the environment was developed. At the same time, the cooling effect on thermoelectric junctions remains. Instead of an inertial process of conductive or convective heat transfer, practically instantaneous heat removal from electronic components to the environment takes place. Results. As a result, light-emitting <b>bipolar</b> <b>semiconductor</b> structures will allow more powerful devices with greater speed and degree of integration to be created. It is possible to produce transparent LED matrices with a two-way arrangement of transparent solar cells and mirror metal electrodes along the perimeter. When current is applied, the LED matrix on one of the transitions will absorb thermal energy; on other electrodes, it will emit radiation that is completely recovered into electricity by means of transparent solar cells following repeated reflection between the mirror electrodes. The low efficiency of solar cells will be completely compensated for with the multiple passages of photons through these batteries. Conclusion. Light-emitting <b>bipolar</b> <b>semiconductor</b> structures will not only improve the reliability of electronic components {{in a wide range of}} performance characteristics, but also improve energy efficiency through the use of optical radiation recovery. Semiconductor thermoelectric devices using optical phenomena in conjunction with the Peltier effect allow a wide range of energy-efficient components of radio electronic equipment to be realised, both for discrete electronics and for microsystem techniques.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Bipolar</b> <b>semiconductor</b> {{devices are}} often used as {{switches}} in very high power electronic circuits and systems. They have replaced the old conventional gas filled tubes and vacuum devices in many applications. This is mainly {{due to the fact}} that solid-state devices are more efficient, smaller in size, cheaper and more reliable. In addition, solid-state devices are considered environmental friendly, since they do not contain nasty gases and toxic materials used in old devices. The power level requirements and switching frequency are continually increasing in the power electronic industry, and this demands larger and faster switching devices. As a result, both bipolar and unipolar semiconductor devices have undergone continued improvement in current and voltage ratings, and switching speed. The main advantage of bipolar devices is their low conduction losses due to conductivity modulation, but their main disadvantage is the high switching losses which is due to minority carrier injection. The Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistor (IGBT) combines the advantages of both unipolar and bipolar devices. It has a simple gate drive circuit like that of the MOSFET, with high current and low saturation voltage capability of bipolar transistor. The main problem remains with the relatively long tail turn-off current.
