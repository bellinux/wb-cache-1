50|$|All Kronan {{bicycles}} have following basic equipment: large tires {{for more}} {{comfort in the}} city, a rear license plate, extra large saddle, coaster brake and front hub brake (As of March 2007, all Kronan models are equipped with a hand <b>brake),</b> <b>dynamo</b> powered front and automatic rear light, rear rack (7 inches (18 cm) wide and 18 inches (46 cm) front to back), stainless steel chain and spokes, steel frame with extra coating for protection, and rims and fenders/mudguards in steel in same color as frame, internal gear hubs, kick stand, bell, and air pump.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Hot judder {{characteristics}} of a ventilated disc brake system are discussed. Three dimensional finite element models of the ventilated disc, pads and pistons are created, and a fully coupled thermo-mechanical analysis of the hot judder phenomenon of the disc brake system is performed using SAMCEF. The <b>brake</b> <b>dynamo</b> test is carried out according to the high speed judder test mode. The evolution of the temperature distribution on the disc surface is described, and the hot spot generation process is investigated. The simulation results such as the maximum disc temperature, BTV are compared to {{the data from the}} dynamo test, and the reliabilities of the analysis technique and simulation model presented in this paper are verified...|$|E
50|$|VÃ©lo'v bicycles, {{along with}} a lock and basket, contain {{electronic}} components which allow the bicycle to be identified by the stations, allow tracking of kilometers traveled, tracking of {{the condition of the}} bicycles, (lights, <b>brakes,</b> <b>dynamo),</b> and collection of detailed statistics about the usage of the bicycles.|$|R
50|$|The cycles {{are single}} speed {{with a plastic}} chainguard, short {{mudguards}} on both wheels, front and rear rim <b>brakes,</b> and <b>dynamo</b> electric lights.|$|R
50|$|Tel-O-Fun {{bikes are}} {{equipped}} with locks and sling backs, and they contain electronic components that allow for their identification by bike stations, track ride, bike mode (lighting, <b>brakes,</b> <b>dynamo),</b> and collecting statistical data on bicycle use. The bicycles are manufactured by the company Panther (Panther Werke) in Germany, and have three gears. They're adapted for women and men alike. Bike parts are not easily broken (the seat is irremovable), {{and they are not}} standard sizes. Tel-O-Fun's bicycle parts don't fit standard bicycles, to prevent the theft and reselling of bicycles and bicycle parts.|$|R

5000|$|Shimano Nexus is a {{brand of}} bicycle {{components}} which includes products such as epicyclical gear hubs, cranksets, shifters, brake levers, hub <b>brakes,</b> hub <b>dynamos,</b> and a CPU for automatically changing gears. The series is primarily aimed at the [...] "comfort" [...] market such as urban commuters and tourers, and as such is not made to withstand the rigours of off-road or mountain biking. The free-wheeling Nexus internal gear hubs are compatible with Shimano's [...] "roller brake", its version of a drum brake, {{but not with the}} Shimano disc brakes used with the higher-end Shimano Alfine internal gear hubs.|$|R
