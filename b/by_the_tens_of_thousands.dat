In the 1920s there was growing anti-Semitism in the United States related to economic competition and the fears of social change from decades of changed immigration, a lingering anti-German sentiment left over from World War I, and anti-black violence erupted in numerous locations as well. In this period African Americans were leaving the South <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands,</b> to escape oppressive social conditions and find work in the North and Midwestern industrial cities, in what came to be called the Great Migration.|$|E

25|$|To {{develop it}} into {{sugarcane}} plantations, the French imported thousands of slaves from Africa. Sugar was a lucrative commodity crop throughout the 18th century. By 1789, approximately 40,000 white colonists lived in Saint-Domingue. In contrast, by 1763 the white population of French Canada, a vast territory, had numbered 65,000. The whites were vastly outnumbered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of African slaves they had imported {{to work on}} their plantations, which were primarily devoted to the production of sugarcane. In the north of the island, slaves were able to retain many ties to African cultures, religion and language; these ties were continually being renewed by newly imported Africans.

25|$|Perez {{had once}} chaired the {{powerful}} Louisiana Democratic State Central Committee, in which capacity in 1948 {{he threatened to}} deprive senatorial candidate Russell B.

Such a move would have denied Long {{a place on the}} Democratic column, the ticket headed with the traditional rooster emblem, which was automatically supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> of white Louisiana voters at the time. The Democratic Party had the only competitive races. Perez toyed with passing the official Democratic mantle to the Republican senatorial nominee, Clem S. Clarke, a Shreveport oilman. Only a deal with Governor Earl Kemp Long kept Long's nephew, Russell Long, on the regular Democratic ticket in Louisiana. The result was that Russell Long began a 38-year tenure in the U.S. Senate.|$|E
25|$|The {{national}} attention received by Dyer's anti-lynching bill and speaking campaign {{may have helped}} reduce lynchings in the South. Lynchings per year dropped in four years, from 60 in 1918 to 57 in 1922. More significantly, the Great Migration was underway, and black workers <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands</b> were leaving the South for Northern and Midwestern industrial cities, for jobs, education, {{and a chance to}} escape Jim Crow laws and violence. By 1934, when the Costigan-Wagner anti-lynching bill was introduced, lynchings had dropped to 15 per year. In 1935 and 1938, Senator Borah repeated his constitutional arguments against the bill; he added that he believed such legislation was no longer needed, because the rate of lynchings had fallen so dramatically. By 1940, 1.5 million blacks had left the South in the Great Migration. Another five million left from 1940–1970.|$|E

Many from the East Coast negotiated a crossing of the Appalachian Mountains, taking to riverboats in Pennsylvania, poling the keelboats to Missouri River wagon train assembly ports, and then travelling in a wagon train along the California Trail.

[...] That evening Trưởng ordered a retreat to a new defense line at the My Chanh River, thereby ceding all of Quảng Trị Province to the North Vietnamese.

[...] Elite crossbowmen were also valued as long-range snipers; such was the case when the Liao general Xiao Talin was picked off by a Song crossbow at the Battle of Shanzhou in 1004. [...] Crossbows were mass-produced in state armories with designs improving as time went on, {{such as the use of}} a mulberry wood and brass crossbow in 1068 that could pierce a tree at 140 paces. [...] Song cavalry used an array of different weapons, including halberds, swords, bows, and fire lances that discharged a gunpowder blast of flame and shrapnel. In preparation for war, government armories manufactured weapons in enormous quantities, with tens of millions of arrowheads crafted each year, along with armor components <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>tens</b> <b>of</b> <b>thousands.</b> There were sixteen known varieties of catapults in the Song period, designed to fit many different proportions and requiring work crews in sizes ranging from dozens to several hundred men.|$|E

The Byzantine ban on the Jews was lifted and they were allowed to live inside the city and visit the places of worship. Christian pilgrims were able to come and experience the Temple Mount area. The war between Seljuqs and Byzantine Empire and increasing Muslim violence against Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem instigated the Crusades. The Crusaders captured Jerusalem in 1099 and the Dome of the Rock was given to the Augustinians, who turned it into a church, and the Al-Aqsa Mosque became the royal palace of Baldwin I of Jerusalem in 1104.

The sight of corpses beside canals, ravaged by dogs and jackals, was common; during a seven-mile boat ride in Midnapore in November 1943, a journalist counted at least five hundred such sets of skeletal remains along the banks of a canal. Jackals would also attack the small and weak among those still living, with disturbing results.

Medina was an active vice president, overseeing many successful union organizing campaigns in the right-to-work Southwest and Deep South. He was a critical supporter of the Active Citizenship Campaign, an effort in the mid-1990s led by Miguel Contreras and others to boost Latino voting in Los Angeles County (and {{which led to the}} election of Antonio Villaraigosa as Mayor of Los Angeles in 2005). He {{played a critical role in}} SEIU's successful strike and organizing campaign at the University of Miami in 2001, engaging in a hunger strike in support of the janitors being organized there. In 2005, he brought the Latino voter project Mi Familia Vota to Arizona, where he and others led a successful effort to enact by referendum a rise in the state minimum wage. He led SEIU's successful campaign to convince the AFL-CIO to abandon its long-standing policy of opposition to illegal immigration and to support legalization of undocumented workers. Since the late 1990s, his views immigration have been largely been adopted by the American labor movement, and he was the Change to Win Federation's chief lobbyist on immigrant rights in 2006.

As of 2006, he oversaw the activities of SEIU locals in 17 Southwestern and West Coast states.
