[...] And now we lost her, now she gleam'd [...] Like Fancy made {{of golden}} air, [...] Now nearer to the prow she seem'd [...] Like Virtue firm, like Knowledge fair, [...] Now high on waves that idly burst [...] Like Heavenly Hope she crown'd the sea [...] And now, the bloodless point reversed, [...] She <b>bore</b> the <b>blade</b> of Liberty.|$|R
5000|$|A fauchard {{is a type}} of polearm {{which was}} used in medieval Europe from the 11th through the 14th centuries. The design {{consisted}} of a curved blade put atop a 6 to 7 ft pole. The <b>blade</b> <b>bore</b> a moderate to strong curve along its length; however, unlike a bill or guisarme, the cutting edge was on the convex side.|$|R
40|$|The {{microstructure}} of as-cast cored {{turbine blades}} roots, {{made of the}} single-crystal CMSX- 4 nickel-based superalloy was investigated. Analysed blades were obtained by directional solidification technique in the industrial ALD Bridgman induction furnace. The investigations of the microstructure of blades roots were performed using SEM and X-ray techniques including diffraction topography {{with the use of}} Auleytner method. Characteristic shapes of dendrites with various arrangement were observed on the SEM images taken from the cross-sections, made transversely to the main blades axis. The differences in quality of the structure in particular areas of blades roots were revealed. Based on the results, the influence of cooling <b>bores</b> on <b>blades</b> root structure was analysed and the changes in the distribution and geometry of cooling bores were proposed...|$|R
2500|$|Officers {{carried a}} service sword, also termed an [...] "undress sword", with {{a blade of}} {{identical}} general form {{to that of the}} trooper's pattern detailed above. However, many officers' <b>blades</b> <b>bore</b> etched, or blued and gilt, decoration. The guard, in contrast, was entirely different from the trooper's pattern, being of bowl form, and incorporating an elaborate pierced honeysuckle design with a prominent rear quillon. This hilt form {{is often referred to as}} a 'ladder hilt.|$|R
60|$|The {{sun came}} proudly {{up in all}} his majesty, the noble river ran its winding course, the leaves quivered and rustled in the air, the birds poured their cheerful songs from every tree, the {{short-lived}} butterfly fluttered its little wings; all the light and life of day came on; and, amidst it all, and pressing down the grass whose every <b>blade</b> <b>bore</b> twenty tiny lives, lay the dead man, with his stark and rigid face turned upwards to the sky.|$|R
40|$|Modifications to a 16 inch STC {{automated}} saw included: a programmable feed system; a crystal rotating system; and a STC dynatrack <b>blade</b> <b>boring</b> and control system. By controlling the plating operation and by grinding the cutting edge, 16 inch I. D. blades were produced with {{a cutting edge}} thickness of. 22 mm. Crystal rotation mechanism was used to slice 100 mm diameter crystals with a 16 inch blade down to a thickness of. 20 mm. Cutting rates with crystal rotation were generally slower than with standard plunge I. D. slicing techniques. Using programmed feeds and programmed rotation, maximum cutting rates were from 0. 3 to 1. 0 inches per minute...|$|R
5000|$|A fauchard {{is a type}} of polearm weapon, {{which was}} used in medieval Europe from the 11th through the 17th centuries. Though in later use, fauchards became {{ornamental}} and ceremonial (fauchard de parade), growing in size until some examples were almost too heavy to carry, let alone use. The design consisted of a curved blade put atop a long pole (though in some portrayals, it is shown on a shorter pole). The <b>blade</b> <b>bore</b> a moderate to strong curve along its length. The cutting edge was only on the [...] side of the blade, unlike the guisarme and bills. The fauchard was likely developed from the war scythe (and is from the scythe (falx) family in general) with the cutting edge turned opposite, convex instead of concave, so that the weapon was good for both thrusting and slashing attacks.|$|R
60|$|The {{instant the}} deck was awash, I opened the conning-tower hatch and stepped out. In another minute the deck-hatch lifted, {{and those who}} were not on duty below {{streamed}} up the ladder, Olson bringing Nobs under one arm. For several minutes no one spoke; I think they must each have been as overcome by awe as was I. All about us was a flora and fauna as strange and wonderful to us as might have been those upon a distant planet had we suddenly been miraculously transported through ether to an unknown world. Even the grass upon the nearer bank was unearthly--lush and high it grew, and each <b>blade</b> <b>bore</b> upon its tip a brilliant flower--violet or yellow or carmine or blue--making as gorgeous a sward as human imagination might conceive. But the life! It teemed. The tall, fernlike trees were alive with monkeys, snakes, and lizards. Huge insects hummed and buzzed hither and thither. Mighty forms could be seen moving upon the ground in the thick forest, while the bosom of the river wriggled with living things, and above flapped the wings of gigantic creatures such as we are taught have been extinct throughout countless ages.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the effect}} of the rotational frequency Ω of OD-blade on its warp. In the analysis, the material constants of a sintered metal bonded diamond blade in common use in precision cutoff grinding are adopted as standard calculating conditions. The obtained results are summarized as follows. (1) In precision cutoff grinding, where the blade protrusion from flange ψ is set below 20 times of the blade thickness t, the initial warp decreases drastically just by fixing the blade to a flange. Under this condition, {{the effect of}} Ω on the warp reduction is slight. (2) When ψ is large, the warp decreases exponentially with the increase of Ω. (3) The warp decreases with the decrease of the blade thickness t under a high value of Ω. (4) The warp decreases slightly with the decrease of the <b>blade</b> <b>bore</b> diameter under a high value of Ω. (5) As for the metal bonded blade in common use, the effect of Ω on the warp reduction can be hardly expected because of its high Young 2 ̆ 7 s modulus E. As for the resin bonded blade in common use, the effect can be expected a little because of its low value of E. (6) Almost independently of Ω, the warp decreases with the increase of Poisson 2 ̆ 7 s ratio. (7) Even if a blade had double density of the metal bonded blade in common use, the effect of Ω on the warp reduction is comparatively slight...|$|R
5000|$|Reina Soho is a Neogene cloneblade {{who works}} as a Forensics Medicine Specialist in the National Scientific Welfare Foundation (NSWF). She is a strong and {{intelligent}} woman. Nevertheless, she is quite self-centered. Unlike most of her First-Generation counterparts, Reina has {{come to terms with the}} fact that Furumizu views her and the rest of her Neogene sisters as nothing more than tools at his disposal. By the same token, however, she feels no obligation to answer to his every beck and call. Her nickname as a Cloneblade is [...] "Lady". In her youth, she was found to be a potential bearer for the [...] "true" [...] Witchblade. Eager to test the limits of her genetic potential, Reina and her assistant, Shiori Tsuzuki, attempted to forcibly remove the Witchblade from Masane. It turns out that Reina's high compatibility with the Witchblade was due to the fact that she was carrying Rihoko at the time, and after giving birth, her compatibility dropped significantly. Of all the Cloneblades, Reina was regarded as the most advanced of her Neogene sisters. As a Cloneblade, Reina <b>bore</b> a huge <b>blade</b> on her left forearm, and had wing-like appendages that could transform into robust shields from blades. Reina considered herself and everyone around her as objects to be researched. She even went so far as to seize custody of her biological daughter, Rihoko, in order to test how motherhood would affect her mentally. Much to her surprise, she began to develop maternal feelings for the girl. The full extent of her love for Rihoko is revealed when she sacrifices herself to protect her from the psychopathic Neogene, Maria. Her cloneblade armor is white and pink.|$|R
2500|$|European-style cabinet saws {{are often}} more complex and modern in design {{compared}} to American types. They often are equipped with a sliding table to make cross cuts easier and safer than {{by the use of}} an American style mitre gauge. Unless modified for the American market, European table saws are not equipped to allow the use of a stacked dado blade set (this is due to safety laws in European markets). Rip fences on European saws tend to be of lighter construction and less smooth in operation compared to American cabinet saws. European cabinet saws are often available in multi-purpose tool configurations that can offer jointer, planer, shaper or <b>boring</b> features. The <b>blade</b> arbor typically has a diameter of 30mm, though for the American market a [...] " [...] arbor is commonly available as an option. Note that American woodworkers are likely to use a stacked dado blade to cut dados (square sectioned grooves) where European woodworkers might use a shaper or other tool for this task. European cabinet saws often incorporate a riving knife to prevent kickback. Riving knives differ from American style splitters in that they rise and fall with the blade (splitters are fixed in place without regard for the height that the blade is adjusted to). Riving knives have since become commonplace on newer American-market tablesaws due to the Consumer Products Safety Commission and UL recommendation in the early to mid-2000s that American-market saws have riving knives (UL std. 987.) European cabinet saws often offer as an option a scoring blade, which is a second, smaller diameter blade mounted in front of the regular saw blade. The scoring blade helps reduce splintering in certain types of stock, especially laminated stock. As of 2015, European-style sliding cabinet saws have a small following in the U.S. They are either imported from European manufacturers such as Felder, Hammer, and Robland or sold directly by U.S. based-companies such as Grizzly Industrial.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the long}} fight began, heaving and {{straining}} and splitting and scattering and narrowing and broadening along the red, wet sands, {{and over and}} between the tangled tree-roots, and through and among the bushes, and {{in and out of}} the grass clumps; for even now the dholes were two to one. But they met wolves fighting for all that made the Pack, and not only the short, high, deep-chested, white-tusked hunters of the Pack, but the anxious-eyed lahinis--the she-wolves of the lair, as the saying is--fighting for their litters, with here and there a yearling wolf, his first coat still half woolly, tugging and grappling by their sides. A wolf, you must know, flies at the throat or snaps at the flank, while a dhole, by preference, bites at the belly; so when the dholes were struggling out of the water and had to raise their heads, the odds were with the wolves. On dry land the wolves suffered; but in the water or ashore, Mowgli's knife came and went without ceasing. The Four had worried their way to his side. Gray Brother, crouched between the boy's knees, was protecting his stomach, while the others guarded his back and either side, or stood over him when the shock of a leaping, yelling dhole who had thrown himself full on the steady <b>blade</b> <b>bore</b> him down. For the rest, it was one tangled confusion--a locked and swaying mob that moved from right to left and from left to right along the bank; and also ground round and round slowly on its own centre. Here would be a heaving mound, like a water-blister in a whirlpool, which would break like a water-blister, and throw up four or five mangled dogs, each striving to get back to the centre; here would be a single wolf borne down by two or three dholes, laboriously dragging them forward, and sinking the while; here a yearling cub would be held up by the pressure round him, though he had been killed early, while his mother, crazed with dumb rage, rolled over and over, snapping, and passing on; and in the middle of the thickest press, perhaps, one wolf and one dhole, forgetting everything else, would be manoeuvring for first hold till they were whirled away by a rush of furious fighters. Once Mowgli passed Akela, a dhole on either flank, and his all but toothless jaws closed over the loins of a third; and once he saw Phao, his teeth set in the throat of a dhole, tugging the unwilling beast forward till the yearlings could finish him. But the bulk of the fight was blind flurry and smother in the dark; hit, trip, and tumble, yelp, groan, and worry-worry-worry, round him and behind him and above him. As the night wore on, the quick, giddy-go-round motion increased. The dholes were cowed and afraid to attack the stronger wolves, but did not yet dare to run away. Mowgli felt that the end was coming soon, and contented himself with striking merely to cripple. The yearlings were growing bolder; there was time now and again to breathe, and pass a word to a friend, and the mere flicker of the knife would sometimes turn a dog aside.|$|R
