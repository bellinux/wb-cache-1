50|$|Bolt seals {{are used}} to secure {{shipping}} containers, trucks and trailers. A <b>bolt</b> <b>seal</b> used for securing containers must conform to the ISO 17712 high security seal {{in order to be}} accepted by customs all around the world in ocean shipping. The C-TPAT (Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) specifies ISO 17712 compliant security seals to be used. Bolt seals are generally closed by hand (by pushing the seal body and head together) and opened with the use of bolt cutters. This gives a strong and secure seal for transportation, while remaining convenient for staff in ports and warehouses.|$|E

The DOE Packaging Certification Program (PCP) has tasked Argonne National Laboratory to develop a Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) temperature monitoring system for use by the facility personnel at DAF/NTS. The RFID temperature monitoring system, depicted in the figure below, consists of the Mk- 1 RFId tags, a reader, and a control computer mounted on a mobile platform that can operate as a stand-alone system, or it can be connected to the local IT network. As part of the Conditions of Approval of the CoC, the user must complete the prescribed training to become qualified and be certified for operation of the RFID temperature monitoring system. The training course will be administered by Argonne National Laboratory on behalf of the Headquarters Certifying Official.

40|$|At {{the ponds}} of La Hague, France, {{different}} types of material are stored awaiting reprocessing: • Irradiated LEU fuel assemblies; • Fresh MOX scrap of different origins; • Irradiated MOX assemblies from research reactors; • Irradiated L/HEU assemblies from research reactors. According to the safeguards approach developed by Euratom, irradiated LEU fuel is verified by Cerenkov viewing devices. Other fuel types are verified with a dedicated underwater neutron/gamma detector. The measurements are resource intensive for both inspectors and operator. In addition, one of the measurement locations will be decommissioned by 2015. Thus, ultrasonic <b>bolt</b> <b>seals</b> (USBS) were identified as a suitable means to keep continuity of knowledge and reduce inspection effort. The paper describes the currently required measurements and the related intense effort and compares with the effort required to place and read USBS. The discussion focuses on the activities required for un-irradiated MOX scrap, which is of particularly high safeguards interest, and {{a description of the}} measures implemented to minimise re-measurement needs is provided. The associated significant savings are demonstrated. Under the new approach, USBS are placed on all newly arriving baskets, following verification by NDA.

5000|$|The Dreyse Zündnadelgewehr or Dreyse needle gun, was a single-shot breech-loading rifle using a {{rotating}} <b>bolt</b> to <b>seal</b> the breech.

It began development in the 1830s under von Dreyse and eventually an improved version of it was adopted by Prussia in the late 1840s. The paper cartridge and the gun had numerous deficiencies; specifically, serious problems with gas leaking. However, the rifle was used to great success in the Prussian army in the Austro-Prussian war of 1866. This, and the Franco-Prussian war of 1870-71, eventually caused much interest in Europe for breech loaders and the Prussian military system in general.|$|R
40|$|Hydroforming, which {{utilizes}} {{hydraulic pressure}} to manufacture metallic components, is a near net shape forming process that could offer many potential advantages {{in terms of}} cost, mechanical properties, weight reduction and manufacturing time over traditional production methods. Through the use of two case studies with components similar to ones used in gas turbine engines, this paper presents {{different ways in which}} hydroforming technology could be exploited to reduce both the part count and operations required to manufacture certain aerospace structures by using methods which have already shown to be effective in other industries. It is shown that cost, manufacturing operations and manufacturing complexity can be reduced while maintaining the function of a component by switching the manufacturing process from a conventional method to one that includes hydroforming. These parts illustrate a method for assessing hydroforming manufacturability from reported theory and heuristics in the available literature. The results provide an example which engineers can use as a case study for how to start assessing how easily a given component can be adapted to the hydroforming process and how the benefits can be assessed. The reason for these results is that hydroforming offers a greater level of material formability compared to other forming processes and as individual components become geometrically more complicated the overall part count can be reduced as it takes fewer components to make an assembly, which in turn reduces weight as fewer nuts, <b>bolts,</b> <b>seals</b> and welding flanges are needed. The automotive industry has already demonstrated that this approach can deliver tangible benefits and hydroformed components are already used in larger airframe structures, but the hope is that the same approach can facilitate similar weight and cost savings in gas turbine engine components...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 1 It {{should be}} an {{objective}} to predict bearing housing vibrations by means of finite element methods and avoid them in the design phase rather than to go in for corrective actions on the test bed or in the field. Bearing housing vibrations due to an excitation by the impeller vanes occur, {{if there is a}} natural frequency of the pump. The finite element method is a useful tool to determine natural frequencies but it is still necessary to compare them with real tested structures. Especially the connecting stiffness between different parts in a structure and the boundary conditions has often to be estimated. Within this paper the determination of bearing housing frequencies has been undertaken systematically from a simple test device to a complete barrel pump. With the test device several influences onto the natural frequencies were studied, such as internal pressure, <b>bolting,</b> <b>seals,</b> and foundation stiffness. It is demonstrated that with appropriate modeling and assumptions the measured frequencies can be accurately met by means of finite elements. The rules observed were applied to full 3 -D model of a barrel pump. The natural frequencies were determined by means of this finite element model. An experimental modal analysis was carried out on the real structure of this pump assembly. At several locations of the surface transducers were placed and the response due to the hammer test was identified in terms of frequencies and modal shapes. This result was correlated with the finite element results to update the finite element model and obtain better congruence between experiment and analysis. The results were promising, especially for the most important bearing housing natural frequency, where the differences between analysis and test were very low. This gives confidence to future analyses of bearing housing vibrations...|$|R

Atomic Oxygen/Vacuum Ultraviolet radiation (AO/VUV) in space is a potential hazard to the seals. Testing was conducted to determine the effect on leakage of the CBM-to-CBM seal material exposed to AO/VUV. The sealing materials were S 383 silicone and V 835 fluorocarbon material. Control samples, which were not exposed to the AO/VUV environment, were used to ensure that ff any changes in leakage occurred, they could be attributed to the AO/VUV exposure.

40|$|Large {{solid rocket}} motors, as {{found on the}} Space Shuttle, are {{fabricated}} in segments for manufacturing considerations, <b>bolted</b> together, and <b>sealed</b> using conventional Viton O-ring seals. Similarly the nine large solid rocket motor nozzles are assembled from several different segments, <b>bolted</b> together, and <b>sealed</b> at six joint locations using conventional O-ring seals. The 5500 F combustion gases are generally kept a safe distance away from the seals by thick layers of phenolic or rubber insulation. Joint-fill compounds, including RTV (room temperature vulcanized compound) and polysulfide filler, are used to fill the joints in the insulation to prevent a direct flow-path to the O-rings. Normally these two stages of protection are enough to prevent a direct flow-path of the 900 -psi hot gases from reaching the temperature-sensitive O-ring seals. However, in the current design 1 out of 15 Space Shuttle solid rocket motors experience hot gas effects on the Joint 6 wiper (sacrificial) O-rings. Also worrisome {{is the fact that}} joints have experienced heat effects on materials between the RTV and the O-rings, and in two cases O-rings have experienced heat effects. These conditions lead to extensive reviews of the post-flight conditions as part of the effort to monitor flight safety. We have developed a braided carbon fiber thermal barrier to replace the joint fill compounds in the Space Shuttle solid rocket motor nozzles to reduce the incoming 5500 F combustion gas temperature and permit only cool (approximately 100 F) gas to reach the temperature-sensitive O-ring seals. Implementation of this thermal barrier provides more robust, consistent operation with shorter turn around times between Shuttle launches...|$|R

The greatest changes in the composition and structure are observed on o-rings particularly due to temperature of 105 °C, there was a significant reduction in dilatability and an increase in stiffness and glass transition temperature. The root cause is the surface and centre additive decomposition and oxidation. The bolts have suffered from decomposition of the protective surface layer and the additives in the centre, structural change was minor. Exposure to 75 °C has resulted in a gradual loss of low molecular weight substances. Liquids at room temperature didn‘t affect the structure of the seals, at 105 °C it caused a loss of weight due to decomposition of the protective surface layer and release of additives and the products of their decomposition. Results showed that the common use of the NBR seals at 105 °C is unsuitable, at 75 °C it leads to gradual changes, loss in mechanical and sealing properties...|$|R

It also sets the operating frequency of the machine. Details of the controller are described in the Phase I final report. Fabrication of the direct-current to direct-current (DC-DC) output stage, which would have stepped down the main controller output voltage from ~ 700 to 120 V(sub DC), was omitted from {{this phase of the}} project for budgetary reasons. However, the main controller was successfully built, tested with the engines, and delivered. We experienced very few development issues with this high-power controller. The project extended significantly longer than originally planned because of yearly funding delays. The team also experienced several hardware difficulties along the development path. Most of these were related to the different thermal expansions of adjacent parts constructed of different materials. This issue was made worse by the large size of the machine. Thermal expansion problems also caused difficulties in the brazing of the opposed stainless steel sodium-potassium (NaK) heater head.
