In this paper most commonly used traditional methodology is used on aggregated basis to calculate the cyclically adjusted primary balance of Turkey over the period from 1979 to 2002.

Considerably more use can be made of output cost information in budgeting – although there are important imitations arising from the nature of some outputs, and from the prevalence of qualitative rationing.
