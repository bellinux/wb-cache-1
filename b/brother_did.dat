5|$|After being underfed {{and forced}} into long, grueling marches through rough terrain {{for nearly two}} months, the Batetela in Dhanis' column mutinied against their {{officers}} in February 1897. The mutiny {{broke out in the}} advance guard, which had been pushed the hardest of those in the expedition, but soon spread to the main army, where the massively outnumbered Belgian officers were detained by their men and killed. Dhanis himself escaped the massacre by hiding in the forest, although his <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> not manage to survive. The now disbanded army went on to rampage throughout the immediate area, terrorizing the northern Congo and causing great consternation among the Belgian officials whose jobs it was to keep the peace.|$|E
5|$|One of Len Waters' brothers, Donald Edward (Jimmy) Waters, {{had served}} as an infantryman with the Australian Army during the war.

Jim declined at the time (he later changed his mind), so Len returned to Australia and left the air force with the rank of warrant officer on 18January 1946.|$|E

5|$|Percy died at Wressle in 1527 and was {{succeeded by}} his son, Henry Algernon Percy, 6th Earl of Northumberland. The Pilgrimage of Grace {{was a popular}} revolt against the rule of Henry VIII in 1536 partly in {{response}} to the dissolution of the monasteries. The rebels in Yorkshire were led by Robert Aske and in October he sought the support of the Percy family. Aske travelled to Wressle Castle and tried to persuade Henry Algernon Percy, who at the time was suffering from illness, to join the rebellion. Though initially opposed to Aske, Percy eventually gave him control of Wressle Castle. Percy had fallen out with his younger brothers, and when he died in 1537 his one surviving <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> not inherit because he was imprisoned {{for his role in the}} Pilgrimage of Grace. In 1537, the crown again resumed control of Wressle Castle, and Henry VIII visited for three nights in 1541.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, {{she began}} her {{academic}} education at the University of Puerto Rico in San Juan. The university {{had a very strong}} independence movement and Rodriguez-Trias became involved with the student faction of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party. Nationalist leader Don Pedro Albizu Campos was invited to speak by the student council, however the chancellor of the university, Jaime Rexach Benítez, did not permit Albizu access to the campus. The students consequently went on strike, with Rodriguez-Trias amongst them, but her <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> not approve of this.

25|$|By {{virtue of}} {{reaching}} {{the final of the}} European Championship, Denmark and Italy qualified for the 2013 World Twenty20 Qualifier. Both Rubin and his brother were selected in the Danish 16-man squad for the tournament, played in the United Arab Emirates in November 2013. Kasper Rubin made his Twenty20 debut against the Netherlands, and took the wicket of their wicket-keeper, Wesley Barresi, to finished with 1/29 from 2.4 overs. In the next match against Afghanistan, he again took a single wicket, finishing with 1/20 from two overs. However, Rubin went wicketless in both Denmark's final group match (against Scotland) and in the 15th-place playoff (against the United States), also scoring a duck in the latter match (his only batting appearance at the tournament). He and his <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> not play together in any games, with Jakob Rubin having played his only match of the tournament against Kenya, three days before Kasper debuted.|$|E
25|$|In {{several cases}} the Catholic {{party in the}} city {{believed}} they had received orders from the king to begin the massacre, some conveyed by visitors to the city, and in other cases apparently coming from a local nobleman or his agent. It seems unlikely any such orders came from the king, although the Guise faction may have desired the massacres. Apparently genuine letters from the Duke of Anjou, the king's younger <b>brother,</b> <b>did</b> urge massacres in the king's name; in Nantes the mayor fortunately held on to his without publicising it until a week later when contrary orders from the king had arrived. In some cities the massacres were led by the mob, while the city authorities tried to suppress them, and in others small groups of soldiers and officials began rounding up Protestants with little mob involvement. In Bordeaux the inflammatory sermon on September 29 of a Jesuit, Edmond Auger, encouraged the massacre that was to occur a few days later.|$|E

25|$|Gabriel {{had asked}} his cousin, Prince Alexander of Leuchtenberg (who himself {{intended}} to marry morganatically), {{to find a}} priest to bless the wedding secretly. At the wedding ceremony, only Lidia Chistyakova (Antonina's sister) {{and a few of}} their friends were present. Gabriel had told his secret to his brother Ivan a few days before, but his elder <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> not want to attend the ceremony because of their mother. However, he promised to keep the secret. On his way to the church, Gabriel saw his brothers Prince Konstantin and Prince Georgy walking on Morskaya Street. They had just met Antonina in a wedding dress in another car. Only later, the two brothers realized what had happened. Once married, Gabriel went to see his mother who, although she was very upset, at the end gave him her blessing. From then on Gabriel moved into Nesteroskaya's apartment where for a time, the couple lived quietly.|$|E
2500|$|Sylvester {{was born}} James Joseph in London, England. His father, Abraham Joseph, was a merchant. [...] James adopted the surname Sylvester when his older <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> so upon {{emigration}} to the United States—a country which {{at that time}} required all immigrants to have a given name, a middle name, and a surname. At the age of 14, Sylvester was a student of Augustus De Morgan at the University of London. His family withdrew him from the University after {{he was accused of}} stabbing a fellow student with a knife. Subsequently, he attended the Liverpool Royal Institution.|$|E

2500|$|In the {{continuation}} of the reading, Moses instructed that when brothers dwelt together and one of them died leaving no son, the surviving brother was to marry the wife of the deceased and perform the levir’s duty, and the first son that she bore was to be accounted to the dead brother, that his name might survive. But if the surviving <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> not want to marry his brother’s widow, then the widow was to appear before the elders at the town gate and declare that the brother refused to perform the levir’s duty, the elders were to talk to him, and if he insisted, the widow was to go up to him before the elders, pull the sandal off his foot, spit in his face, and declare: [...] "Thus shall be done to the man who will not build up his brother’s house!"

2500|$|In 255, {{when the}} Wei generals Guanqiu Jian and Wen Qin started a {{rebellion}} in Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui), Sima Shi led Wei imperial forces {{to suppress the}} revolt, with Zhong Hui accompanying him as an assistant officer. Sima Shi's younger brother, Sima Zhao, followed behind with another army to support them. Sima Shi died in Xuchang after the rebellion was suppressed. He was succeeded by Sima Zhao, who took over command of his troops. At the time, the Wei emperor Cao Mao ordered Sima Zhao to remain in Xuchang and Fu Jia to lead the armies back to the imperial capital, Luoyang. Zhong Hui conspired with Fu Jia to urge Sima Zhao to disregard the emperor's order and lead the troops to a garrison at {{the south of the}} Luo River (雒水) near Luoyang. Sima Zhao became the new regent and continued to remain in control of the Wei government as his <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> before him.

2500|$|Compared to most {{domestic}} dogs, {{the bark}} of a dingo is short and monosyllabic. During observations, the barking of Australian dingoes was shown to have a relatively small variability; sub-groups of bark types, common among domestic dogs, could not be found. Furthermore, only 5% of the observed vocalisations were made up of barking. Australian dingoes bark only in swooshing noises or in a mixture atonal/tonal. Also, barking is almost exclusively used for giving warnings. Warn-barking in a homotypical sequence {{and a kind of}} [...] "warn-howling" [...] in a heterotypical sequence has also been observed. The bark-howling starts with several barks and then fades into a rising and ebbing howl and is probably, similarly to coughing, used to warn the puppies and members of the pack. Additionally, dingoes emit a sort of [...] "wailing" [...] sound, which they mostly use when approaching a water hole, probably to warn already present dingoes. According to the present state of knowledge, {{it is not possible to}} get Australian dingoes to bark more frequently by making them associate with other domestic dogs. However, Alfred Brehm reported a dingo that completely learned the more [...] "typical" [...] form of barking and knew how to use it, while its <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> not. Whether dingoes bark or bark-howl less frequently in general is not sure.|$|E

2500|$|Mahmud {{left the}} empire {{to his son}} Mohammed, who was mild, affectionate and soft. His brother, Mas'ud, asked for three provinces that he had won by his sword, but his <b>brother</b> <b>did</b> not consent. Mas'ud had to fight his brother, and he became king, {{blinding}} and imprisoning Mohammed as punishment. Mas'ud was unable to preserve the empire and following a disastrous defeat at the Battle of Dandanaqan in 1040, he lost all the Ghaznavid lands in Iran and Central Asia to the Seljuks, plunging the realm into a [...] "time of troubles". His last act was to collect all his treasures from his forts in hope of assembling an army and ruling from India, but his own forces plundered the wealth and he proclaimed his blind brother as king again. The two brothers now exchanged positions: Mohammed was elevated from prison to the throne, while Mas'ud was consigned to a dungeon after a reign of ten years and was assassinated in 1040. Mas'ud's son, Madood, was governor of Balkh, and in 1040, after hearing of his father's death, he came to Ghazni to claim his kingdom. He fought with {{the sons of the}} blind Mohammed and was victorious. However, the empire soon disintegrated and most kings did not submit to Madood. In a span of nine years, four more kings claimed the throne of Ghazni.|$|E
