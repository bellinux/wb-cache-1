5|$|The {{start of}} the Industrial Revolution was marked by a massive <b>boom</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> textile industry, with {{remarkable}} technological innovations made, led by the cotton industry of Great Britain. In its early years, there were often disparities in technological innovation between different stages of fabric manufacture, which encouraged complementary innovations.

Growing cities required many new homes and buildings, thus benefiting the construction industry. Agriculture and ranching grew stronger as the rapidly expanding population created more demand for their produce.|$|E

Cities like New York, Baltimore and Philadelphia saw their {{population}} <b>boom</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{second half of the}} century; New York tripled in size between 1850 and 1890, for example. This drove up the demand for ice considerably across the region. By 1879, householders in the eastern cities were consuming two thirds of a ton (601kg) of ice a year, being charged 40 cents ($9.30) per 100 pounds (45kg); 1,500 wagons were needed just to deliver ice to consumers in New York.|$|E
5|$|The electoral {{district}} {{ceased to exist}} {{at the drop of}} the writ for the 1888 Northwest Territories general election.

The {{electoral district}} was redistributed and split between the electoral districts of Batoche and the Prince Albert electoral district. During the nine years the district existed, it returned three members through three elections who served roughly three-year terms.|$|E

The city experienced a second, much larger building boom that lasted from the early 1970s to late 1980s. During this time, Dayton saw the construction of six skyscrapers, including the Kettering Tower and KeyBank Tower.|$|E
5|$|The {{second reason}} the {{district}} is significant is its collection of buildings and their architectural styles (Criterion C).

Three styles of architecture, Italianate, Renaissance Revival, and Romanesque Revival are all well represented, and additional styles can also be found.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the rule}} of Isma'il Pasha, the {{grandson}} of Muhammad Ali, major public works projects were initiated {{with the aim of}} transforming Cairo into a European styled city.
