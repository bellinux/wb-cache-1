5|$|Two years later, when Wollstonecraft {{published}} the Rights of Woman, she extended {{many of the}} arguments she had begun in Rights of Men. If all people should <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>on</b> their merits, she wrote, women {{should be included in}} that group. In both texts, Wollstonecraft emphasizes that the virtue of the British nation is dependent on the virtue of its people. To a great extent, she collapses the distinction between private and public and demands that all educated citizens be offered the chance to participate in the public sphere.|$|E
5|$|In the 1968–69 season, third-year defenceman Bobby Orr scored 21goals {{to set an}} NHL {{record for}} goals by a defenceman en route to winning his first of eight {{consecutive}} Norris Trophies as the league's top defenceman. At the same time, Orr's teammate, Phil Esposito, became the first player in league history to score 100 points in a season, finishing with 126points. A gifted scorer, Orr revolutionized defencemen's impact on the offensive part of the game, as blue-liners began to <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>on</b> how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them. Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer, the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. Chronic knee problems plagued Orr throughout his career; he played 12seasons in the NHL before injuries forced his retirement in 1978. Orr finished with 270goals and 915points in 657games, and he won the Hart Memorial Trophy as league Most Valuable Player thrice.|$|E

25|$|During his {{lifetime}} Polwhele {{was seen as}} a minor figure, though prolific, and after his death he was little read. The contemporary reader may find some of Polwhele's preoccupations, particularly botany and fashion, amusing. The Unsex'd Females, however, was a salvo in a propaganda war that the participants took extremely seriously. After the revolution in literary criticism in the 1970s and 1980s when it was successfully argued that works could not solely <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>on</b> their literary merit, poems such as Polwhele's were resurrected. They have subsequently shed considerable light on the cultural moments during which they were written. The Unsex'd Females remains of considerable interest today as a vibrant example of the politically charged culture of the revolutionary period in Britain.|$|E
25|$|The Ahmadiyya Muslim Community {{believes}} that divine decree controls the eventual outcome of all actions in this universe.

25|$|Islam {{integrated}} {{the concept}} of Jinn from pre-Islamic animism, but reduced {{the status of the}} former divine Jinn to mortals and created entities, who share the earth along with humans and will <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>on</b> judgement Day by the only one God. Accordingly, the society of Jinn resembles that of humans, and are believed to procreate, eat, sleep, die and practise religion. Due to their similarities with humans, several narrations hold, that humans and Jinn may have sexual interactions and some legal book even deal with conditions of a marriage between these different beings. Nevertheless, Islam forbids interaction with Jinn. The Jinn may also cause possession and harm humans, but Jinn attacks are considered as an result of their own intention instead of evil nature, although an individual Jinni maybe evil, but then because of its own decision. The Jinn live either in an intermediary realm, between the divine world and the physical plane, like the Greek Daemon and ancient Rome Genii or roaming earth invisible to humans eye.|$|E
25|$|Reproductive system: Vagina is {{more than}} twice the length of the oviduct. Oviduct about half as long as the {{proximal}} part of the pedunculus, which is longer than the distal part. Basally the pedunculus is much broader than the adjoining oviduct. The bursa of the bursa copulatrix is separate from the spermoviduct; it reaches hardly further than the diverticulum. Male part of the genitalia with a single retractor muscle, without flagellum or caecum. Penis is tripartite as far as can <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>on</b> the basis of the transparent genital slides, forming a loop with a sharp curvature about halfway. Proximal half formed by (1) a short segment with a relatively simple luminal surface, followed by (2) a clearly broader and about three times longer part with some longitudinal ridges with zigzag borders. Distal half, with the insertion of the retractor muscle slightly distal from halfway, about as broad or little broader than the narrow part of the proximal half; penial segment (3) with a relatively simple luminal surface; epiphallus (4) with a vague pattern of small pustulae, most clearly seen at its distal end. Vas deferens, a short part of the penis and nearly as much as the proximal half of the vagina united by a common sheath.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after moving}} to Athens, Tryfonos {{attended}} the Athens auditions for the first season of Greek Idol. There she received all yes votes from the judges along with praise, while judge Kostas Kapetanidis predicted {{that she would be}} in the top ten. Tryfonos initially did not want to audition for the show, but did so after encouragement from family and friends, as well as after having viewed a television commercial for the show; producers called her back the next day. She had not told anyone she was auditioning besides her brother and best friend, and instead told her parents about it shortly before the first episode was set to air. Tryfonos had also previously auditioned for the second season of rival Greek talent competition The X Factor, and passed the audition phase before ultimately being cut before the live shows. In response, she later stated that {{she did not want to}} join any reality show as she did not want to <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>on</b> anything other than her voice, but auditioned for Greek Idol as she believed it was more of a simple talent show. Throughout the competition, she was considered a favourite to win. Recalling her experience on the show later on, she stated that she thought she would make it as a finalist onto the live shows with some difficulty, but never expected to win the completion. Following recall rounds and ten live shows, Trifonos came first in the competition and won a recording contract with Sony Music Entertainment Greece.|$|E

500|$|A gifted scorer, Orr {{revolutionized}} defencemen's {{impact on}} the offensive side of the game, as blue-liners began to <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>on</b> how well they created goals in addition to how well they prevented them. Orr scored the Stanley-Cup-winning goal in overtime of the fourth game against the Blues in 1970, which gave the Bruins their first championship in 29 years. The goal was highlighted by his famous flight through the air after being tripped up following his shot. Orr twice won the Art Ross Trophy as the NHL's leading scorer, still the only defenceman in NHL history to do so. [...] His plus/minus of +124 in 1970–71 is a league record. [...] Orr signed a five-year contract that paid him $200,000 per season in 1971, the first $1million contract in league history.|$|E
500|$|Contrasting her middle-class values against Burke's aristocratic ones, Wollstonecraft {{contends that}} people should <b>be</b> <b>judged</b> <b>on</b> their merits rather than on their birthrights. As Wollstonecraft scholar Janet Todd writes, [...] "the vision of society {{revealed}} [...] A Vindication of the Rights of Men was one of talents, where entrepreneurial, unprivileged children could compete on equal terms with the now wrongly privileged." [...] Wollstonecraft emphasizes the benefits of hard work, self-discipline, frugality, and morality, values she contrasts with the [...] "vices of the rich", such as [...] "insincerity" [...] and the [...] "want of natural affections". She endorses a commercial society that would help individuals discover their own potential as well as force them to realize their civic responsibilities. For her, commercialism would be the great equalizing force. However, several years later, in Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark (1796), she would question the ultimate benefits of commercialism to society.|$|E

One 1984 reviewer found the album [...] "a very enjoyable recording", and stated that Frith's music [...] "is changing the way many musicians look at the sounds that they take so seriously". The New Gibraltar Encyclopedia of Progressive Rock described Cheap at Half the Price as Frith's response to punk, a low-tech approach to performing songs. It called the album a [...] "twisted pop" [...] record, {{saying that it is}} [...] "as uncompromising as everything else Frith recorded". François Couture in a review of Frith's 2002 album, Prints called Cheap at Half the Price [...] "the best tongue-in-cheek take at the New Wave".|$|E
