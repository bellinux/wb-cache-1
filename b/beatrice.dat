5|$|Achebe's first central female {{character}} in a novel is <b>Beatrice</b> Nwanyibuife in Anthills of the Savannah. As an independent woman in the city, <b>Beatrice</b> strives for the balance that Okonkwo lacked so severely. She refutes the notion that she needs a man, and slowly learns about Idemili, a goddess balancing the aggression of male power. Although {{the final stages of}} the novel show her functioning in a nurturing mother-type role, <b>Beatrice</b> remains firm in her conviction that women should not be limited to such capacities.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beatrice</b> {{continued}} {{to appear in}} public after her mother's death. The public engagements she carried out were often related to her mother, Queen Victoria, as the public had always associated <b>Beatrice</b> with the deceased monarch.|$|E
5|$|Helena, as promised, lived {{close to}} the Queen, and both she and <b>Beatrice</b> {{performed}} duties for her. <b>Beatrice,</b> whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side, carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that <b>Beatrice</b> {{did not have time}} to do. In later years, Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated her journal in the last months of her life.|$|E
50|$|Her {{oldest brother}} Edward became dangerously ill {{when she was}} very young. Though he recovered, <b>Beatrice's</b> {{youngest}} sister Katharine died {{at a very young}} age leaving <b>Beatrice's</b> parents grief-stricken.

5|$|Subtle persuasions by the Princess of Wales and the Crown Princess of Prussia, who {{reminded}} her {{mother of the}} happiness that <b>Beatrice</b> had brought the Prince Consort, induced the Queen to resume talking to <b>Beatrice.</b> Queen Victoria consented to the marriage on condition that Henry give up his German commitments and live permanently with <b>Beatrice</b> and the Queen.|$|E
5|$|The devotion that <b>Beatrice</b> showed to {{her mother}} was {{acknowledged}} in the Queen's letters and journals, but her constant need for <b>Beatrice</b> grew stronger. The Queen suffered another bereavement in 1883, when her highland servant, John Brown, died at Balmoral. Once again, the Queen plunged into public mourning and relied on <b>Beatrice</b> for support. Unlike her siblings, <b>Beatrice</b> had not shown dislike for Brown, and the two had often been seen in each other's company; indeed, they had worked together {{to carry out the}} Queen's wishes.|$|E
5|$|A year later, John {{breaks out}} of prison and {{attempts}} to flee with <b>Beatrice</b> and their child. However, <b>Beatrice</b> falls ill and John must return to the village for a doctor. There he finds that Edward has reappeared. John's affairs are now cleared up and he is legally free from the charge of murder. Pettigrew is subsequently accidentally shot and no longer a threat to John and his family.|$|E

5|$|According {{to one of}} her biographers, Giles St Aubyn, Victoria {{wrote an}} average of 2,500 words a day during her adult life. From July 1832 until just before her death, she kept a {{detailed}} journal, which eventually encompassed 122 volumes. After Victoria's death, her youngest daughter, Princess <b>Beatrice,</b> was appointed her literary executor. <b>Beatrice</b> transcribed and edited the diaries covering Victoria's accession onwards, and burned the originals in the process. Despite this destruction, much of the diaries still exist. In addition to Beatrice's edited copy, Lord Esher transcribed the volumes from 1832 to 1861 before <b>Beatrice</b> destroyed them. Part of Victoria's extensive correspondence has been published in volumes edited by A. C. Benson, Hector Bolitho, George Earle Buckle, Lord Esher, Roger Fulford, and Richard Hough among others.|$|E
5|$|After a short honeymoon, <b>Beatrice</b> and {{her husband}} {{fulfilled}} their promise {{and returned to the}} Queen's side. The Queen made it clear that she could not cope on her own and that the couple could not travel without her. Although the Queen relaxed this restriction shortly after the marriage, <b>Beatrice</b> and Henry travelled only to make short visits with his family. Beatrice's love for Henry, like that of the Queen's for the Prince Consort, seemed to increase the longer they were married. When Henry travelled without <b>Beatrice,</b> she appeared happier when he returned.|$|E
5|$|Although court {{entertainments}} {{were few}} after the Prince Consort's death, <b>Beatrice</b> and the Queen enjoyed tableau vivant photography, which was often {{performed at the}} royal residences. Henry, increasingly bored {{by the lack of}} activity at court, longed for employment, and in response, the Queen made him Governor of the Isle of Wight in 1889. However, he yearned for military adventure and pleaded with his mother-in-law to let him join the Ashanti expedition fighting in the Anglo-Asante war. Despite misgivings, the Queen consented, and Henry and <b>Beatrice</b> parted on 6 December 1895; they would not meet again. Henry contracted malaria and was sent home. On 22 January 1896, <b>Beatrice,</b> who was waiting for her husband at Madeira, received a telegram informing her of Henry's death two days earlier.|$|E

5|$|Andrew {{was the son}} of Stephen the Posthumous, the self-styled Duke of Slavonia, and {{his second}} wife, Tomasina Morosini. Andrew's father was born to <b>Beatrice</b> D'Este, the third wife of Andrew II of Hungary, after the king's death. However, Andrew II's two elder sons, Béla IV of Hungary and Coloman of Halych, accused <b>Beatrice</b> D'Este of {{adultery}} and refused to acknowledge Stephen the Posthumous as their legitimate brother. Andrew's mother, Tomasina Morosini, was the daughter of wealthy Venetian patrician Michele Morosini.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beatrice</b> and Henry {{were married}} at Saint Mildred's Church at Whippingham, near Osborne, on 23 July 1885. <b>Beatrice,</b> who wore her mother's wedding veil of Honiton lace, was escorted by the Queen and Beatrice's eldest brother, the Prince of Wales. Princess <b>Beatrice</b> was {{attended}} by ten royal bridesmaids from among her nieces: Princess Alix and Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine; Princess Alexandra, Princess Marie, and Princess Victoria Melita of Edinburgh; Princess Louise, Princess Maud, and Princess Victoria of Wales; Princess Marie Louise and Princess Helena Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. The bridegroom's supporters were his brothers, Prince Alexander of Bulgaria and Prince Francis Joseph of Battenberg.|$|E
5|$|<b>Beatrice</b> fell in {{love with}} Prince Henry of Battenberg, the son of Prince Alexander of Hesse and by Rhine and Julia von Hauke and {{brother-in-law}} of her niece Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine. After a year of persuasion, Queen Victoria, whose consent was required pursuant to the Royal Marriages Act, finally agreed to the marriage, which took place at Whippingham on the Isle of Wight on 23 July 1885. Queen Victoria consented on condition that <b>Beatrice</b> and Henry make their home with her and that <b>Beatrice</b> continue her duties as the Queen's unofficial secretary. The Prince and Princess had four children, but 10 years into their marriage, on 20 January 1896, Prince Henry died of malaria while fighting in the Anglo-Asante War. <b>Beatrice</b> remained at her mother's side until Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901. <b>Beatrice</b> devoted the next 30 years to editing Queen Victoria's journals as her designated literary executor and continued to make public appearances. She died at 87, outliving all her siblings, two of her children, and several nieces and nephews including George V and Wilhelm II.|$|E

As a teenager, Goulding was {{involved}} with the IRA youth wing Fianna Éireann. After Brendan Behan's early death at the age of 41 on 20 March 1964, Goulding had Paudge Behan with Brendan's widow <b>Beatrice.</b> Paudge and his half-sister Blanaid grew up at 5 Anglesea Road, a red-brick, semi-detached late Victorian house in Ballsbridge, Dublin, which Brendan Behan bought for his wife <b>Beatrice</b> in 1959 for IR£1,400.
