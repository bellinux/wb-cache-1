500|$|On 7 May, Benfica {{played their}} final match {{of the season}} at Estádio da Mata Real. Benfica's Manuel Fernandes scored first but could not prevent Paços de Ferreira scoring three second-half goals, thus losing the game. Benfica ended the season in third place, missing out on the title and an {{automatic}} place in the 2006–07 UEFA Champions League. Despite winning both games against Porto, the closest Benfica had come from them was on the 18 and 19 match-days, with only three points. Benfica closed the season 12 points behind the leader and five from Sporting. Of the Big Three, Benfica conceded the most goals (29) and scored the second-highest number of goals (51), with the worst goal-average (+22). Koeman wanted to fulfil his contract with Benfica, but after negotiations with the management and sudden interest from PSV, Benfica opted to release him on mutual terms. Koeman thanked Luís Filipe Vieira and José Veiga for their support in face of repeated criticism, and said, [...] "This is very big club, but you cannot win all the time, although I admit, that in the Primeira Liga, {{he did not do}} everything he could. We could have done better. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> It was a pleasure being here, now my career will continue elsewhere." ...|$|E

[...] He also said, [...] "this is the homeland of the Jewish people, this is where our identity was forged." [...] He stated that {{he would be willing to}} meet with any [...] "Arab leader" [...] for negotiations without preconditions, specifically mentioning Syria, Saudi Arabia, and Lebanon. In general, the address represented a new position for Netanyahu's government on the peace process.|$|E

And he said: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. They [...] say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put away? He [...] saith to them: Because Moses by reason of the hardness of your heart permitted you to put away your wives: but from the beginning it was not so.|$|E
2500|$|While Kenny {{observes that}} the AOH was [...] "a {{peaceful}} fraternal society", he does {{note that in}} the 1870s the Pinkerton Agency identified a correlation between the areas of AOH membership in Pennsylvania, and the corresponding areas in Ireland from which those particular Irish immigrants emigrated. The violence-prone areas of Ireland corresponded to areas {{of violence in the}} Pennsylvania coalfields. In his book Big Trouble, which traces McParland's history, writer J. Anthony Lukas has written: [...] "The WBA was run by Lancashire men adamantly opposed to violence. But [...] saw an opportunity to paint the union with the Molly brush, which he did in testimony before a state investigating committee ... 'I do not charge this Workingmen's Benevolent Association with it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> there is an association which votes in secret, at night, that men's lives shall be taken ...

2500|$|Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu {{immediately}} called a special government meeting after Obama finished his address. Yedioth Ahronoth {{has stated that}} the address' words [...] "resonated through Jerusalem's corridors". On 14 June, Netanyahu gave a speech at Bar-Ilan University in which he endorsed, for the first time, a two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians; the speech was widely seen {{as a response to}} Obama's speech. In a rejoinder to Obama's mentioning of the founding of Israel {{in the context of the}} Holocaust, Netanyahu remarked, [...] "here are those who say that if the Holocaust had not occurred, the State of Israel would never have been established. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> that if the State of Israel would have been established earlier, the Holocaust would not have occurred." [...] Netanyahu stated that he would accept a Palestinian state if Jerusalem were to remain the united capital of Israel, the Palestinians would have no army, and the Palestinians would give up their demand for a right of return. He also stated that existing Jewish settlements in the West Bank will expand while their permanent status is up to further negotiation. The overture was quickly rejected by Palestinian leaders such as Hamas spokesman Sami Abu Zuhri, who called the speech [...] "racist".|$|E

2500|$|A lighter {{incident}} occurred regarding that accusation during the Nebraska primary campaign. [...] The state's former governor, Frank Morrison, who was actively campaigning for McGovern, sought {{to counter the}} Jackson and Humphrey campaigns' effective use of the accusation. [...] During a campaign speech, Morrison declared, [...] "They say that George McGovern is for the legalization of marijuana, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> --" [...] At this point there was thunderous applause from the younger people in the audience, which left Morrison puzzled, but when it died down, he finished, [...] "I tell you that George McGovern does not advocate the legalization of marijuana." [...] This produced cries of disappointment in the audience. [...] He continued, [...] "They say George McGovern is for abortion on demand, but I tell you--" [...] Again there was deafening applause, followed by sighs of regret when he finished the sentence: [...] "But I {{say to you that}} George McGovern is against tampering with our state laws on abortion." [...] Afterwards, Morrison confessed to McGovern, [...] "Maybe I'm too old to understand this new generation. [...] I'll get the oldsters for you, and you take care of the young ones as you think best." [...] McGovern won the Nebraska primary.|$|E
2500|$|As {{early as}} 1816 or 1817, James Greenleaf made known {{to his wife}} his desire to return to Washington, D.C., to live full-time. Ann Greenleaf, however, was unwilling to do so. In an 1817 letter to her friend and trustee, William Tilghman, she wrote: [...] "It would be unkind of me to say to Mr. Greenleaf, that I never shall be {{reconciled}} to a residence in Washington, D.C., and I believe {{that he does not}} suspect that such are my sentiments, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> to you my dear Sir unhesitatingly, that I dislike Washington... I love retirement, particularly the retirement of Allentown." [...] Nonetheless, Ann accompanied her husband to the District of Columbia for short periods. They spent Christmas 1821 in the city, and during the winter of 1826 they rented a home (owned by William H. Crawford) on 14th Street NW just north of Thomas Circle. They also spent the summer of 1828 in the city, living at Washington House at 222 North Capitol Street. During the first two decades of the new century, Greenleaf continued to repair many of his personal relationships. By 1830, he had reconciled with most of his family. He spent Christmas 1830 at the Washington home of his brother-in-law, William Cranch. During this stay, he also reunited with Noah Webster {{for the first time in}} years.|$|E
2500|$|Stanley is Eddie's next-door neighbor, who {{is obsessed}} with Raven. He serves as the primary {{antagonist}} of the show, he has a frenemy relationship with Eddie and Cory, although he is usually seen scamming them. Stanley was originally brought in as a love interest for Raven's next-door neighbor, Sierra, but he becomes {{much more interested in}} Raven, and in one episode, Loka. Stanley is rude, obnoxious, mean, sarcastic, and deceptive to everyone. He is a young salesman, who usually tricks Cory into buying something that would eventually go wrong. Stanley is always trying desperately to get Raven to like him, but he suddenly leaves her alone after seeing her kiss Andre in the episode [...] "Mr. Perfect". He loves to eat cheese sandwiches. He also competes against Chelsea in a ping-pong match, and loses. In the same episode ("Taken to the Cleaners"), he asks Victor to make him a cheese sandwich {{in the shape of a}} ping-pong paddle. His catchphrases include [...] "My brotha!", which he exclaims whenever he is trying to [...] "show someone up"; and [...] "I may have said that, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>say</b> a lot of things." [...] This is a partial denial of his ability to be nice to other people. He appears primarily in Seasons 3 and 4, in the episodes [...] "Opportunity Shocks"; [...] "Taken to the Cleaners"; [...] "The Grill Next Door"; [...] "Mr. Perfect"; [...] "The Four Aces"; [...] "Driving Miss Lazy"; [...] "Sister Act"; [...] "Checkin' Out"; [...] "Fur Better or Worse" [...] and [...] "When 6021 Met 4267". He also appeared in the Cory in the House episode [...] "Uninvited Pest" [...] when he covets the Presidential medal Cory was going to receive for his Young Businessperson of the Year project. He got into the [...] "Up with Goodness" [...] program, feigned an ankle injury, and stole Cory's presentation. It is also noted that he has a fear of bones, which helps Cory prove that Stanley faked the injury and stole his presentation.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1826, Ibrahim managed to capture the marshes around the city, {{although}} not without heavy losses. He thus cut the Greeks off from the sea and blocked off their supply route. Despite the Egyptians and the Turks offering them terms to stop the attacks, the Greeks refused, and continued to fight. On 22 April, the Greeks decided to sail from the city during the night, with 3,000 men, to cut {{a path through the}} Egyptian lines and allow 6,000 women, children and non-combatants to follow. However, a Bulgarian deserter informed Ibrahim of the Greeks' intention, and he had his entire army deployed; only 1,800 Greeks managed to cut their way through the Egyptian lines. Between 3,000 and 4,000 women and children were enslaved and {{many of the people who}} remained behind decided to blow themselves up with gunpowder rather than be enslaved. The news that the Third Siege of Missolonghi had ended in an Ottoman victory sparked horror all over Greece; at the National Assembly, Kolokotronis was giving a speech when the news of Missolonghi's fall reached him, leaving him to remember: [...] "the news came to us that Missolonghi was lost. We were all plunged into great grief; for half an hour there was so complete a silence that no one would have thought there was a living soul present; each of us was revolving in his mind how great was our misfortune". The American philhellene Samuel Gridley Howe, serving as a doctor with the Greeks, wrote back to America: [...] "I write you with an almost breaking heart. Missolonghi has fallen!", which he called [...] "damning proof of the selfish indifference of the Christian world. You may talk to me of national policy and the necessity of neutrality, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>say,</b> a curse upon such a policy!". The news of Missolonghi's fall had a huge impact on the rest of Europe, sparking a vast outpouring of songs, poems, essays, sermons and plays in Britain, France, Germany and Switzerland, with the recurring image of Missolonghi's fall being the murder of a sweet and innocent young Greek woman at the hands of the Turks as a symbol of the unwillingness of the Christian powers of the world to do anything for the Greeks. In May 1826, Hastings arrived in Greece with a British-built steamship, the Karteria (Perseverance), which astonished the Greeks to see a ship powered by steam and did not move either via sail or oars. The Karteria suffered from constant engine breakdowns, but Hastings was able to use the ship successfully twice over the course of the next two years, at Volos and in the Gulf of Corinth.|$|E
