These statues were originally at the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia. Devotees believe that the statues have healing qualities to rub a particular part of the <b>body</b> <b>against</b> the statues to cure themselves of various ailments and diseases.|$|E
5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are part}} of the body's {{integumentary}} system and serve to protect the <b>body</b> <b>against</b> germs. Sebaceous glands secrete acids that form the acid mantle. This is a very fine, slightly acidic film {{on the surface of the}} skin that acts as a barrier to bacteria, viruses, and other potential contaminants that might penetrate the skin. The pH of the skin is between 4.5 and 6.2, and this acidity helps to neutralise the primarily alkaline nature of contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Because it {{interfaces}} {{with the}} environment, skin {{plays an important}} immunity role in protecting the <b>body</b> <b>against</b> pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, synthesis of vitamin D, {{and the protection of}} vitamin B folates. Severely damaged skin will try to heal by forming scar tissue. This is often discolored and depigmented.|$|E

Dumisani Kumalo, South Africa's UN ambassador and the current council president, then ended the meeting.|$|E
25|$|When swimming, {{the waves}} become larger {{as they move}} down the snake's body, and the wave travels {{backwards}} faster than the snake moves forwards. Thrust is generated by pushing their <b>body</b> <b>against</b> the water, resulting in the observed slip. In spite of overall similarities, {{studies show that the}} pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation, which justifies calling them separate modes. All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).|$|E

25|$|Lymphoid tissue {{associated}} with the lymphatic system is concerned with immune functions in defending the <b>body</b> <b>against</b> infections {{and the spread of}} tumors. It consists of connective tissue formed of reticular fibers, with various types of leukocytes, (white blood cells), mostly lymphocytes enmeshed in it, through which the lymph passes. Regions of the lymphoid tissue that are densely packed with lymphocytes are known as lymphoid follicles. Lymphoid tissue can either be structurally well organized as lymph nodes or may consist of loosely organized lymphoid follicles known as the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue.|$|E
25|$|On July 9, 1993, the {{prominent}} Toronto attorney Garry Hoy fell {{from a window}} in a playful attempt to demonstrate {{to a group of}} new legal interns that the windows of the city's Toronto-Dominion Centre were effectively unbreakable. He had performed the same stunt on several previous occasions – dramatically slamming his <b>body</b> <b>against</b> the window – but this time it popped out of its frame and he fell to his death. The accident was later commemorated for its unusual nature by a 1996 Darwin Award and has been re-enacted in several films and television shows.|$|E
25|$|When push-points are absent, {{but there}} is not enough space to use sidewinding because of lateral constraints, such as in tunnels, snakes rely on {{concertina}} locomotion. In this mode, the snake braces the posterior portion of its <b>body</b> <b>against</b> the tunnel wall while the front of the snake extends and straightens. The front portion then flexes and forms an anchor point, and the posterior is straightened and pulled forwards. This mode of locomotion is slow and very demanding, up to seven times the cost of laterally undulating over the same distance. This high cost is due to the repeated stops and starts of portions of the body as well as the necessity of using active muscular effort to brace against the tunnel walls.|$|E

25|$|After she has {{fixed the}} {{position}} of the nest, she begins to build the nest. She repeats the procedure of bringing in a pulp, attaching it to the nest to form a spindle and flying back out to bring in more pulps. During this process, the queen clings to the nest with her two posterior pairs of legs and attaches the pulp using her anterior legs and mouth parts. She builds 20–30 cells before initial egg-laying, fashioning a petiole and producing a single cell at the end of it. Six further cells are then added around this to produce the characteristic hexagonal shape of the nest cells. One egg is laid in each cell, and as it hatches, each larva holds itself in the vertical cell by pressing its <b>body</b> <b>against</b> the sides.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} ichthyosaurs {{are known}} from the Early and Early-Middle (Olenekian and Anisian) Triassic strata of Canada, China, Japan, and Spitsbergen in Norway, being up to 246 million years old. These first forms included the genera Chaohusaurus, Grippia, and Utatsusaurus. This diversity suggests an even earlier origin. They more resembled finned lizards than the fishes or dolphins to which the later, more familiar species were similar. Their bodies were elongated and they probably used an anguilliform locomotion, swimming by undulations of the entire trunk. Like land animals, their pectoral girdles and pelves were robustly built, and their vertebrae still possessed the usual interlocking processes to support the <b>body</b> <b>against</b> the force of gravity. However, they were already rather advanced in having limbs that had been completely transformed into flippers. They also were probably warm-blooded and viviparous.|$|E
25|$|Film {{capacitors}} for use {{in electronic}} equipment are packaged in the common and usual industry styles: axial, radial, and SMD. Traditional axial type packages are less used today, but are still specified for point-to-point wiring and some traditional through-hole printed circuit boards. The most common form factor is the radial type (single ended), with both terminals {{on one side of}} the capacitor body. To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor <b>body</b> <b>against</b> environmental influences. Although the transient heat of reflow soldering induces high stress in the plastic film materials, film capacitors able to withstand such temperatures are available in Surface Mounted Device“ (SMD) packages.|$|E

25|$|Before Dr Ezra {{can take}} a look at Bac-Bac, he trips over him in the dark and they both fall down his doorway stairs. After the fall, Ezra finds the dead body and assumes that he accidentally killed him. Recognizing Bac-Bac, they repeat the actions of Faisal and Safil by {{dropping}} the body down the chimney of their Chinese neighbor, Hi-Ching (Junix Inocian). Hi-Ching mistakenly believes that he is about to be robbed and attacks Bac-Bac with Kung Fu. Hi-Ching mistakenly believes that he killed Bac-Bac by hitting him so hard and (like the others) he fears for his welfare. So he carries the body to a dark alcove, where Englishman Jerome Gribben (Roger Hammond) is walking home in a drunken stupor. Bac-Bac's body falls onto Jerome, who believes he is being attacked. He repeatedly hits the <b>body</b> <b>against</b> a wall, and calls the nearby guards. The guards recognize Bac-Bac and arrest Jerome for murder.|$|E

40|$|Basal {{bodies are}} {{radially}} symmetric, microtubule-rich structures that nucleate and anchor motile cilia. Ciliary beating produces asymmetric mechanical {{forces that are}} resisted by basal bodies. To resist these forces, distinct regions within the basal body ultrastructure and the microtubules themselves must be stable. However, the molecular components that stabilize basal bodies remain poorly defined. Here, we determine that Fop 1 functionally interacts with the established basal body stability components Bld 10 and Poc 1. We find that Fop 1 and microtubule glutamylation incorporate into basal bodies at distinct stages of assembly, culminating in their asymmetric enrichment at specific triplet microtubule regions that are predicted to experience the greatest mechanical force from ciliary beating. Both Fop 1 and microtubule glutamylation are required to stabilize basal <b>bodies</b> <b>against</b> ciliary beating forces. Our studies reveal that microtubule glutamylation and Bld 10, Poc 1, and Fop 1 stabilize basal <b>bodies</b> <b>against</b> the forces produced by ciliary beating via distinct yet interdependent mechanisms...|$|R
