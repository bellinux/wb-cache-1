5|$|As {{animals at}} {{the summit of the}} food chain, <b>bears</b> do not have many predators. The most {{important}} are humans, and as they started cultivating crops, they increasingly came in conflict with the <b>bears</b> that raided them. Since the invention of firearms, people have been able to kill <b>bears</b> with greater ease. The tiger is the only four-legged predator that regularly preys on adult <b>bears,</b> including brown <b>bears,</b> sloth <b>bears,</b> Asiatic black <b>bears,</b> and sun <b>bears.</b>|$|E
5|$|Brown <b>bears</b> {{typically}} dominate wolf packs in {{disputes over}} carcasses, while wolf packs mostly prevail against <b>bears</b> when defending their den sites. Both species kill each other's young. Wolves eat the brown <b>bears</b> they kill, while brown <b>bears</b> seem to only eat young wolves. Wolf interactions with American black <b>bears</b> are much rarer than with brown <b>bears,</b> because {{of differences in}} habitat preferences. The majority of black bear encounters with wolves occur in the species' northern range, with no interactions being recorded in Mexico. Wolves have been recorded on numerous occasions to actively seek out black <b>bears</b> in their dens and kill them without eating them. Unlike brown <b>bears,</b> black <b>bears</b> frequently lose against wolves in disputes over kills. While encounters with brown and black <b>bears</b> appear to be common, polar <b>bears</b> are rarely encountered by wolves, though there are two records of wolf packs killing polar bear cubs. Wolves also kill the cubs of Asian black <b>bears.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Dummi <b>Bears</b> are parodies of the Care <b>Bears</b> franchise, and {{the film}} they are {{featured}} in, The Land Without Smiles, is a parody of the feature length 1985 film The Care <b>Bears</b> Movie based on the franchise, while {{the title of the}} film is a reference to the Care Bears' first TV special from 1983, The Care <b>Bears</b> in the Land Without Feelings.

5|$|Against the Baltimore Ravens in week twelve, the <b>Bears</b> wore their 1940s {{alternate}} uniforms. The <b>Bears</b> last {{played the}} Ravens in 2009, which {{ended with a}} Baltimore 31–7 victory. With Jay Cutler still out, Josh McCown continued to play as quarterback for the <b>Bears,</b> who had the eighth-best passing offense in the league with 261.7 yards per game, which competed against the Ravens' 18th-ranked pass defense. On the ground, the Ravens had the tenth-best rushing D with 102.6 rushing yards allowed per game, but offensively, had the 30th-ranked rushing offense, averaging just 73.1 yards per game, going against Chicago's defense which allowed 129.4 rushing yards per game. Against Joe Flacco, the <b>Bears</b> {{had the opportunity to}} force turnovers, as Flacco had thrown eleven interceptions in the previous nine games. For the <b>Bears</b> on offense, a liability was to protect McCown from Terrell Suggs and Elvis Dumervil, who combined for 17 of 32 sacks by the Ravens. Two parties had the majority favoring the <b>Bears</b> for the game: 10 of 13 ESPN analysts predicted a <b>Bears</b> victory, with Ron Jaworski, Seth Wickersham and Cris Carter being the only three to predict a win for Baltimore. CBS Sports analysts predicted the Ravens would win in a 5–4 vote.|$|E
5|$|American black <b>bears</b> were {{a common}} {{attraction}} by the 1930s, but in 1929 alone 81people required treatment for bear-related injuries. Troublesome <b>bears</b> were marked with white paint before being relocated {{to other parts}} of the park, and repeat offenders were killed. Bear feeding shows were stopped in 1940, but the Park Service continued to kill <b>bears</b> that habitually raided camps; 200 were put down between 1960 and 1972. Park visitors are now educated about proper food storage.|$|E
5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 grizzly <b>bears</b> {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more}} than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The grizzly is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the grizzly are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black <b>bears</b> are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the <b>bears</b> starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with <b>bears</b> has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black <b>bears</b> can be seen coexisting with grizzly <b>bears.</b> Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bears</b> are carnivoran mammals of {{the family}} Ursidae. They are {{classified}} as caniforms, or doglike carnivorans. Although only eight species of <b>bears</b> are extant, they are widespread, appearing {{in a wide variety}} of habitats throughout the Northern Hemisphere and partially in the Southern Hemisphere. <b>Bears</b> are found on the continents of North America, South America, Europe, and Asia. Common characteristics of modern <b>bears</b> include large bodies with stocky legs, long snouts, small rounded ears, shaggy hair, plantigrade paws with five nonretractile claws, and short tails.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bears</b> are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black <b>bears</b> found seventeen species of endoparasite including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar <b>bears</b> have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar <b>bears,</b> and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar <b>bears.</b> <b>Bears</b> in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black <b>bears</b> dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bears,</b> {{both black}} and brown, are seen in Glacier Bay in the {{intertidal}} zone which they frequent for foraging. They are also seen “scraping barnacles off of rocks and munching mussels.” Invariably they are spotted wandering alone along the beaches of the Glacier Bay in search of salmon. The habitats of the black <b>bears</b> are generally the southern forested areas of the bay. However, the brown <b>bears</b> are mostly found in the northern, more recently glaciated zones of the Glacier Bay. Occasionally, black <b>bears</b> are sighted near the glaciers or near Gustavus town. Black <b>bears</b> with black dots and brown <b>bears</b> with brown dots have been {{seen over the last}} 10 years. Their travel routes have been identified as along the easy tracks such as along beaches, stream beds and river valleys. The most commonly identified locations for sighting <b>bears</b> in the Glacier Bay are: The Bartlett Cove, the Bartlett River, the Beardslee Islands and North and South Sandy Cove locations for black <b>bears,</b> while brown <b>bears</b> are seen to the north of Tidal Inlet in the west arm of glacier and north of Adams Inlet in the east arm. They are also seen swimming in the Bay, crossing from one bank to the other. Salmon are their favorite food, apart from bumblebees, sand fleas, bird eggs, birds, voles and marine mammal carcasses.|$|E

5|$|Chicago <b>Bears</b> quarterback Jim McMahon, on {{the active}} roster {{for the first}} time in the season, came off the bench in the third quarter to rally the <b>Bears</b> past the Buccaneers. He scored a {{touchdown}} on a quarterback sneak with six minutes to go, and tied the game with a touchdown pass to Neal Anderson with 1:28 to go. The Buccaneers allowed seven sacks, but led for most of the game. The <b>Bears</b> were aided by the Buccaneers' poor clock management and their reliance on a conservative offense in the fourth quarter. Perkins denied accusations that they went to a prevent defense and a three-man rush, but admitted that they played too conservatively on defense at the end. Steve DeBerg threw touchdown passes to Calvin Magee and Jeff Smith on the Buccaneers' first two possessions. On the Bears' next possession, Ron Holmes' hit on Mike Tomczak forced a fumble that was recovered in the end zone by Winston Moss to give the Buccaneers a 20–0 lead. The <b>Bears</b> scored two quick touchdowns in the second quarter, but the Buccaneers extended their lead with two Donald Igwebuike field goals. With the <b>Bears</b> struggling on offense, McMahon was inserted into the game. McMahon was 12 of 14 for 144yards and led the <b>Bears</b> to 156yards of offense in the last two drives, compared with 142 in the first 50minutes of the game. A win would have tied the Buccaneers with the <b>Bears</b> for first place in the NFC Central.|$|E
5|$|Chicago entered week sixteen with {{a chance}} to clinch the NFC North in the event that the Packers and Lions lost. The Packers and Lions {{eventually}} lost to the Steelers and Giants, respectively, putting the <b>Bears</b> in position to win the division by defeating the Eagles. The last game between the <b>Bears</b> and Eagles was in 2011, when the <b>Bears</b> won 30–24; the <b>Bears</b> also lead the all-time series 30–12–1, though the Eagles had won six of the last ten meetings. However, the <b>Bears</b> had won four of five meetings between the two teams in the last six years, but all by less than six points. One of the Bears' keys to victory is to prevent LeSean McCoy from dominating; the <b>Bears</b> had the worst run defense in the league, while McCoy leads the league in rushing. Chicago's defense also must contain the Eagles' fast-scoring offense: the Eagles had the lowest average time of possession per drive at 2:24, while the league average is 3:27. Philadelphia also is the only team in the league to score in fewer than seven plays per drive. In the passing game, Chicago had the fourth-best passing offense, while the Eagles were 26th in pass defense. However, the Eagles are ranked sixth in rushing defense.|$|E
5|$|Entering the bye, the <b>Bears</b> had the seventh-best third down {{conversion}} percentage with 43.68, {{while having}} 118 first downs converted, {{one more than}} that of teams that the <b>Bears</b> had played.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} history of the park, {{visitors}} were allowed, and sometimes even encouraged, to feed the <b>bears.</b> Visitors welcomed the chance to get their pictures taken with the <b>bears,</b> who had learned to beg for food. This led to numerous injuries to humans each year. In 1970, park officials changed their policy and started a vigorous program to educate the public on the dangers of close contact with <b>bears,</b> and to try to eliminate opportunities for <b>bears</b> to find food in campgrounds and trash collection areas. Although it has become more difficult to observe <b>bears</b> in recent years, the number of human injuries and deaths has taken a significant drop and visitors are in less danger. The eighth recorded bear-related death in the park's history occurred in August 2015.|$|E
5|$|In week two, the <b>Bears</b> donned their 1940s {{alternate}} uniforms against rival Minnesota, in {{the second}} home game of the season, marking {{the first time since}} 1999 that the <b>Bears</b> hosted the first two games of the regular season. During the two games played between the rivals last season, the <b>Bears</b> won the first game 28–10, while the Vikings won the second 21–14. Since 2001, the <b>Bears</b> led the series 16–10. ESPN writes that the <b>Bears</b> could capitalize on the Vikings' tendency to turn the ball over, as they gave away the ball to the Detroit Lions four times in week one. Chicago's defense should also prevent NFL MVP Adrian Peterson, who had been struggling when playing the <b>Bears</b> at Soldier Field. Since 2009, Peterson has been able to record only 73 rushing yards per game.|$|E

Support for bear protection is widespread, at least in more affluent societies. Where <b>bears</b> raid crops or attack livestock, they may come into conflict with humans.
