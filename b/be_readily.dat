5|$|All welding of {{tantalum}} {{must be done}} in an {{inert atmosphere}} of argon or helium in order to shield it from contamination with atmospheric gases. Tantalum is not solderable. Grinding tantalum is difficult, especially so for annealed tantalum. In the annealed condition, tantalum is extremely ductile and can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> formed as metal sheets.|$|E

5|$|Bakerian mimicry, {{named after}} Herbert G. Baker, {{is a form}} of automimicry where female flowers mimic male flowers of their own species, {{cheating}} pollinators out of a reward. This reproductive mimicry may not <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> apparent as members of the same species may still exhibit some degree of sexual dimorphism. It is common in many species of Caricaceae.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the basic}} fruit body {{structure}} in all genera of the Nidulariaceae family is essentially similar, Cyathus may <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> confused with species of Nidula or Crucibulum, especially older, weathered specimens of Cyathus {{that may have}} the hairy ectoperidium worn off. It distinguished from Nidula {{by the presence of}} a funiculus, a cord of hyphae attaching the peridiole to the endoperidium. Cyathus differs from genus Crucibulum by having a distinct three-layered wall and a more intricate funiculus.|$|E

5|$|Freemasonry {{and women}} have a complex relationship, which can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> divided into many phases with no {{demonstrable}} relationship to each other until the 20th century. A few women were involved in Freemasonry before the 18th century; however the first printed constitutions of the Premier Grand Lodge of England appeared to bar them from the Craft forever.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe maculata {{is similar}} to the {{variable}} Inocybe lacera, the split fibrecap, but it can be differentiated by the darker colouration of the cap, and the white remains of the veil in the centre of the cap. The species is also similar in appearance to Inocybe lanatodisca, but can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> distinguished by odour (I.lanatodisca has a characteristic sweet, green-corn smell) and the colour of the cap (I.lanatodisca has a fulvous cap). It is closely related to Inocybe fastigiata, but can again be distinguished by colour; I.fastigiata has lighter coloured fibrils.|$|E
5|$|Observation of Neptune in the {{radio-frequency}} band {{shows that}} it is a source of both continuous emission and irregular bursts.

5|$|Some silver {{compounds}} are very explosive, {{such as the}} nitrogen compounds silver azide, silver amide, and silver fulminate, as well as silver acetylide, silver oxalate, and silver(II) oxide. They can explode on heating, force, drying, illumination, or sometimes spontaneously. To avoid the formation of such compounds, ammonia and acetylene should be kept away from silver equipment. Salts of silver with strongly oxidising acids such as silver chlorate and silver nitrate can explode on contact with materials that can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> oxidised, such as organic compounds, sulfur and soot.|$|E
5|$|Superficial or surface anatomy is {{important}} as the study of anatomical landmarks that can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> seen from the exterior contours of the body. It enables physicians or veterinary surgeons to gauge the position and anatomy of the associated deeper structures. Superficial is a directional term that indicates that structures are located relatively {{close to the surface}} of the body.|$|E
5|$|The cap is chestnut, rusty, olive brown, or {{dark brown}} {{in color and}} {{generally}} 4–10cm (rarely to 13cm) in diameter at maturity. The cap has a distinctive conical shape, later flattening out. It is slimy to the touch, bare, smooth, and glossy even when dry, and the cuticle is easily peeled off. The tiny, circular pores of the tubes are initially yellow but turn olive to dark yellow with maturity. Like {{the skin of the}} cap, they can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> peeled away from the flesh.|$|E

5|$|Two {{pilots were}} filmed. Fascinated by mathematicians, creators Cheryl Heuton and Nicolas Falacci {{decided to create}} a show about one. With the {{encouragement}} of CBS development executives, they wrote several pilots revolving around mathematicians and scientists, including the pilot for Numb3rs, {{over the course of}} 14 years. Knowing that mathematics would not <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> accepted by the general public on its own, Heuton and Falacci in 2003 decided to use the police procedural format to facilitate the acceptance. When Falacci and Heuton pitched the pilot, CBS agreed to produce it about halfway through their presentation.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} {{sources are}} {{silent on the}} matter, {{it is more than}} likely that on Somairle's demise, his territory was divided amongst his surviving sons. The precise allotment of lands is unknown; even though the division of lands amongst later generations of meic Somairle can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> discerned, such boundaries are unlikely to have existed during the chaotic twelfth century. It is possible that the territory of the first generation of meic Somairle may have stretched from Glenelg in the north, to the Mull of Kintyre in the south; with Áengus ruling in the north, Dubgall centred in Lorne (with possibly the bulk of the inheritance), and Ragnall in Kintyre and the southern islands.|$|E
5|$|Because {{germanium}} is transparent in {{the infrared}} wavelengths, {{it is an important}} infrared optical material that can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> cut and polished into lenses and windows. It is especially used as the front optic in thermal imaging cameras working in the 8 to 14micron range for passive thermal imaging and for hot-spot detection in military, mobile night vision, and fire fighting applications. It is used in infrared spectroscopes and other optical equipment that require extremely sensitive infrared detectors. It has a very high refractive index (4.0) and must be coated with anti-reflection agents. Particularly, a very hard special antireflection coating of diamond-like carbon (DLC), refractive index 2.0, is a good match and produces a diamond-hard surface that can withstand much environmental abuse.|$|E

5|$|Because it cannot <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> {{produced}} {{by reduction of}} its dioxide, titanium metal is obtained by reduction of TiCl4 with magnesium metal in the Kroll process. The complexity of this batch production in the Kroll process explains the relatively high market value of titanium, despite the Kroll process being less expensive than the Hunter process. To produce the TiCl4 required by the Kroll process, the dioxide is subjected to carbothermic reduction {{in the presence of}} chlorine. In this process, the chlorine gas is passed over a red-hot mixture of rutile or ilmenite in the presence of carbon. After extensive purification by fractional distillation, the TiCl4 is reduced with 800°C molten magnesium in an argon atmosphere. Titanium metal can be further purified by the van Arkel–de Boer process, which involves thermal decomposition of titanium tetraiodide.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{diagnostic}} {{features of}} Entoloma murrayi include the bright yellow coloring, the conical cap, cube-shaped spores, and club-shaped cheilocystidia. Entoloma quadratum {{is similar in}} size and morphology, but is colored salmon-orange. E.murrayi has the habit and form of some similarly colored mushrooms in the genus Hygrocybe (such as Hygrocybe marginata var. concolor), but it can <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> distinguished from those by its salmon-pink spore print, non-waxy gills, and the angular shape of its spores. Entoloma luteum is a duller yellow color, with a less distinctly pointed umbo. The South American species E.dennisii, originally misidentified as E.murrayi, can be distinguished from the latter by its less conical cap and considerably smaller spores that measure 5.5–7μm.|$|E
5|$|For {{greatest}} {{efficiency and}} best coupling to the room's air volume, subwoofers {{can be placed}} {{in a corner of the}} room, far from large room openings, and closer to the listener. This is possible since low bass frequencies have a long wavelength; hence there is little difference between the information reaching a listener's left and right ears, and so they cannot <b>be</b> <b>readily</b> localized. All low frequency information is sent to the subwoofer. However, unless the sound tracks have been carefully mixed for a single subwoofer channel, it's possible to have some cancellation of low frequencies if bass information in one channel is out of phase with another.|$|E
