2500|$|Louis {{began his}} career in the United States by working as a {{construction}} laborer and mason during the day, and studying both English and <b>blue-print</b> reading in the evenings. In 1925 he enrolled at the University of Michigan, and graduated with a Bachelor's degree in architecture in 1929. After graduation, Redstone worked with Albert Kahn Associates. However, the Great Depression intervened, and Redstone moved on to work for Ford Motor Company designing plants in the Soviet Union and then opened his own practice in Tel Aviv. There he worked at the Levant Fair designing pavilions, many in the International Style. He also [...] received a number of commissions for moderate-sized apartment buildings.|$|E
2500|$|The {{document}} probably {{dates from}} after 914 {{during the reign}} of Alfred's son, Edward the Elder. This assumes that it was compiled as part of the preparations for Edward the Elder's campaign against the Danes in 917. The list identifies 30 burhs in Wessex, two in Mercia and one in Hwicce. The view that the Burghal Hidage is of early 10th century date is based on the inclusion of Buckingham and Oxford, two settlements that were sited in Mercia not Wessex, and according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Buckingham was created as a burh by Edward the Elder in 918. The Chronicle also reports that Edward the Elder took possession of London and Oxford in 910; Buckingham being situated between the two would have also been included. It is possible that the Burghal Hideage was created as a <b>blue-print</b> for the way that burhs were connected with hidation, originally worked out in Wessex, and applied to the situation in Mercia at that time. [...] This received view has now been challenged from two directions – from the perspectives of the strategies involved, and a new interpretation of the coinage of King Alfred.|$|E

6000|$|It did {{not occur}} to her till Mr. Wilkins {{developed}} nervous indigestion by trying to [...] "break in" [...] a new secretary who couldn't tell a <b>blue-print</b> from a set of specifications, that he had his side in the perpetual struggle between ill-paid failure employers and ill-paid ambitious employees. She was sorry for him as she watched him putter, and she helped him; stayed late, and powerfully exhorted her successor. Mr. Wilkins revived and hoped that she would stay another week, but stay she could not. Once {{she knew that she}} was able to break away from the scrub-rag, that specter of the wash-room, and the bleak, frosted glass on the semi-partition in front of her desk, no wage could have helped her. Every moment here was an edged agony.|$|E
6000|$|Back in {{the work}} room she wandered solemnly about, glancing now at the prodigious filing system, at the chart and <b>blue-print</b> cabinets, at the {{revolving}} shelves of reference books, and at the long rows of stoutly bound herd registers. At last she came to his books--a goodly row of pamphlets, bound magazine articles, and an even dozen ambitious tomes. She read the titles painstakingly: [...] "Corn in California," [...] "Silage Practice," [...] "Farm Organization," [...] "Farm Book-keeping," [...] "The Shire in America," [...] "Humus Destruction," [...] "Soilage," [...] "Alfalfa in California," [...] "Cover Crops for California," [...] "The Shorthorn in America"--at this last she smiled affectionately with memory of the great controversy he had waged for the beef cow and the milch cow as against the dual purpose cow.|$|E
60|$|At sunset Sidney {{hurried to}} her room {{to take off the}} soiled and faded cotton dress she had worn while milking. She had milked eight cows and pumped water for the milk-cans {{afterward}} in the fag-end of a hot summer day. She did that every night, but tonight she had hurried more than usual because she wanted to get her letter written before the early farm bedtime. She had been thinking it out while she milked the cows in the stuffy little pen behind the barn. This monthly letter was the only pleasure and stimulant in her life. Existence would have been, so Sidney thought, a dreary, unbearable blank without it. She cast aside her milking-dress with a thrill of distaste that tingled to her rosy fingertips. As she slipped into her <b>blue-print</b> afternoon dress her aunt called to her from below. Sidney ran out to the dark little entry and leaned over the stair railing. Below in the kitchen there was a hubbub of laughing, crying, quarrelling children, and a reek of bad tobacco smoke drifted up to the girl's disgusted nostrils.|$|E

Original tubes from Farnsworth's early experiments were on display at the Rigby High School for many years. They are now held by the Jefferson County Museum in Rigby. A section of the former Yellowstone highway, passing through the community, has been named in Farnsworth's honor.|$|R
50|$|Ever {{since the}} {{expulsion}} of the Kuomintang government, concluding the Chinese Civil War, the People's Liberation Army relied heavily upon support from the Soviet Union for supplies and weaponry. At the commencement of the post-Civil War period, the People's Republic of China and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics cooperated heavily towards the industrialisation of China, which had experienced decades of ceaseless warfare. During this period of Sino-Soviet friendship, Chinese factories, {{with the assistance of}} Soviet <b>blue-prints</b> and technical assistance, began mass-producing Soviet-designed weapons such as the Type 50 submachine gun, Type 54 pistol, Type 56 carbine and the Type 56 assault rifle.|$|R

50|$|In 1785, John Davenport {{began as}} a potter working with Thomas Wolfe of Stoke. In 1794, he {{acquired}} his own pottery at Longport and began producing cream-coloured <b>blue-printed</b> earthenware. By September 1806 {{the quality of his}} porcelain wares was such that the Prince of Wales, later to become King George IV, ordered services of the finest and most valuable kinds. John retired in 1830 and his sons, William and Henry, carried on the firm. Henry died in 1835 and the firm became William Davenport and Company. William died in 1869.

The riveted construction was seen as a drawback, but since redrawing the blueprints for a welded construction was estimated to delay production by almost a year, no changes were made to the 116 m/41 ordered from Scania-Vabis in June 1941. Deliveries started in December 1942 and were completed in August 1943, no less than three years behind the original plan.|$|R

In doing so, it is argued that there is scope for ‘working with the grain’ and harnessing the political economy of government policy in order to produce financial inclusion outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliography. The Macroeconomics for {{development}} blue print for Latin America and the Caribbean is articulated around two issues: an active strategy of productive development and a {{counter cyclical policy}} stance. Macroeconomic counter cyclicality refers to {{the management of the}} level of aggregate demand to dampen the fluctuations and volatility of real and nominal variables around their long-term trends. This paper argues that cycle and trend are interdependent and that, as a result, counter cyclical policies (i. e., aggregate demand policies) are not neutral to the long-run behaviour of economies.
