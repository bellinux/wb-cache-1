On the [...] "Token Skeptic" [...] podcast Michael Marshall said, [...] "How we try to always pitch it and how we try and run it is - it's all about the skeptical community. Because its being run by people who are just part of that community who are doing this <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> love it, the atmosphere, seems to be, of people coming together. It's kind of a big party, a celebration of UK skepticism and also international skepticism".|$|E
500|$|Burton biographer Ken Hanke {{criticized the}} {{depiction}} of Dolores Fuller. [...] "The real Fuller is a lively, savvy, humorous woman," [...] Hanke said, [...] "while Parker's performance presents her {{as a kind of}} sitcom moron for {{the first part of the}} film and a rather judgmental and wholly unpleasant character in her later scenes." [...] During her years with Wood, Fuller had regular TV jobs on Queen for a Day and The Dinah Shore Show, which are not mentioned. Fuller criticized Parker's portrayal and Burton's direction, but still gave Ed Wood a positive review. [...] "Despite the dramatic liberties, I think Tim Burton is fabulous. I wished they could have made it a deeper love story, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> loved each other. We strove to find investors together, I worked so hard to support Ed and I." ...|$|E
500|$|The TV {{documentary}} [...] explored {{gay rights}} and homophobia in numerous {{countries in the}} world, including Russia. [...] In it, Fry interviews a lesbian couple who discuss their fears that simply being out to their 16-year-old daughter and her friends could be taken as breaking this law, due to the law's prohibition [...] "on anyone disseminating information about homosexuality to under 18s". [...] The LGBT news magazine The Advocate described the law as criminalising [...] "any positive discussion of LGBT people, identities, or issues in forums that might be accessible to minors. In practice, the law has given police broad license to interpret almost any mention of being LGBT [...] whether uttered, printed, or signified by waving a rainbow flag [...] as just cause to arrest LGBT people." [...] The US State Department in its 2013 report on human rights in Russia noted the clarification from Roskomnadzor (the Russian Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications) that the [...] "gay propaganda" [...] prohibited under the law includes materials which [...] "directly or indirectly approve {{of people who are}} in nontraditional sexual relationships." [...] One couple interviewed by Fry said: [...] "Of course we are afraid <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> don't know what's going to happen next in the country. ... You just don't know if they can incarcerate you tomorrow for something or not." [...] Fry also interviewed politician Vitaly Milonov, the original proponent of the law, whose attempts to defend it have been strongly criticised; Milonov responded branding Fry as [...] "sick" [...] for making a suicide attempt while filming the documentary in an interview in which he also compared homosexuality with bestiality.|$|E

5000|$|Zermati later said: [...] "The real punk {{movement}} {{started in}} New York, and Paris {{came before the}} UK <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were <b>really</b> connected to New York... it was exciting <b>because</b> <b>we</b> thought we were conspiring against the establishment." [...] He also claimed that he persuaded Malcolm McLaren to call the movement [...] "punk" [...] rather than McLaren's preferred term, [...] "new wave". An important influence on the style {{and content of the}} movement in the UK was the French Situationist movement, led by Guy Debord.|$|R
5000|$|Among the band's members, {{there are}} several {{different}} stories for what the album's title means. Mark Lee said [...] "We named the album Conspiracy No. 5 <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were <b>really</b> into [...] "conspiracy theories" [...] which were swirling around {{at the time in}} the wake of the JFK movie." [...] The group also found the use of the number five compelling for several reasons: there are five members of the band and it was their fifth project (including their independent releases).|$|R

But it's impossible [...] Back in the early 80s you could probably do it, but now with YouTube and downloading, the songs would all be out before the album was out. We did Somewhere Back in Time and that dealt with the 80s, and the time before that we did A Matter of Life and Death, just the one album. You can't {{go out and play}} the greatest hits every time – it's important to play the newer songs <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> believe in them." ...|$|E

The {{attitude}} and tactics of Drummond and Cauty's partnership matched {{that of the}} fictional cult whose name they had adopted. Throughout the partnership, these tactics were often interpreted by media commentators as [...] "Situationist pranks" [...] or [...] "publicity stunts". However, according to Drummond, [...] "That's {{just the way it}} was interpreted. We've always loathed the word scam. I know no-one's ever going to believe us, but we never felt we went out and did things to get reactions. Everything we've done has just been on a gut level instinct." [...] Cauty has expressed similar feelings, saying of the KLF, [...] "I think it worked <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> meant it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Bell and {{his family}} moved to Los Angeles to create a new soap opera. During this time, his three children, William Jr., Bradley, and Lauralee Bell, each became {{involved}} in soap operas. Lauralee Bell worked as an actress on The Young and the Restless. Bradley Bell co-created The Bold and the Beautiful with his father. William Bell Jr. became involved in the family's production companies as president of Bell Dramatic Serial Co. and Bell-Phillip Television Productions Inc. [...] "It's worked out very well for us <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> all worked in very different aspects of the show," [...] William Bell Jr. said. [...] "With my father and I, it was a great kind of partnership and pairing {{in the sense that he}} had a total control of the creative side of the show and I didn't have even the inclination to interject in what he was doing." ...|$|E

In a 2007 interview when asked which EWF album is his favorite Earth, Wind & Fire leader Maurice White replied [...] "Probably Faces <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were <b>really</b> in tune, playing together and it gave {{us the opportunity to}} explore new areas".|$|R

It was a special time <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were <b>really</b> {{beginning}} to break through with that record, both commercially and critically. The people that liked that record connected with it in a special way. There was a depth to it: it created its own mythology. It stood out. It was our most successful record to date and, critically, the Paul Morleys of this world were writing very nice things about it." ...|$|R
2500|$|Loeb {{described}} {{the season as}} [...] "a fugitive story", and [...] "a story of redemption", {{and said it was}} about Luke Cage's [...] "story and where he came from and, most importantly, where he’s going" [...] after [...] "catching him not quite in the middle, but {{in the early part of}} the middle" [...] of his story on Jessica Jones. On this, Colter noted that like the previous Marvel Netflix series, Luke Cage uses flashbacks [...] "to tell a different part of the story." [...] Coker described [...] "a powerful fusion of dark drama, hip-hop, and classic superhero action"; [...] "The Wire of Marvel television, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> deal with a lot of different issues." [...] More specifically, Coker felt the season was a [...] "hip-hop Western", comparing it to Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of films, with Cage the Man with No Name coming to a town, Harlem, where he is convinced to fight injustice. Coker further compared the characters Cottonmouth and Misty Knight to the resident villain and local law enforcement, respectively, of the Western genre, and {{described the}} Harlem's Paradise nightclub as the town's saloon.|$|E
2500|$|Charles Murray, Kayla Cooper, and Nathan Jackson {{served as}} writers on the series. Coker {{noted that the}} {{majority}} of the series' writers are African-American, [...] "a rarity on television". After signing on to the series, Coker was able to read the first two scripts of both Marvel's Daredevil and Jessica Jones, giving him an idea of the quality of writing for those series, and how important the development of their villains was. Actor Mike Colter described the series as having [...] "soul" [...] and [...] "intensity", compared to the [...] "dark action" [...] of Daredevil and the [...] "noir feel" [...] of Jessica Jones. Coker described [...] "a powerful fusion of dark drama, hip-hop, and classic superhero action" [...] while being [...] "The Wire of Marvel television, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> deal with a lot of different issues." [...] Jason Tanz of Wired likened the series to neo-blaxploitation, which Coker agreed with in that [...] "blaxploitation is [...] black characters being able to assert themselves in a visual world", stating that he felt the series was more specifically a [...] "hip-hop Western", comparing its characters and setting to Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy of films (with Cage the Man with No Name, for example).|$|E
2500|$|The duo had not {{expected}} to star in a film at this point of their careers, with Mitchell stating that [...] "it probably came much earlier than {{we thought we would}} do a film. [...] It landed very fortuitously on our doormat." [...] At first, Mitchell and Webb were not considered for the roles of Harry and Karl, but O'Connor changed his mind [...] "it became clear they could do these parts really well. [...] And we thought, well, wouldn't it be great to do our first movie with people we know, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>really</b> admire and enjoy working with them". Unlike most other Mitchell and Webb projects, Olivia Colman does not have a main part in the film. O'Connor explained that [...] "Olivia was part of the development and did some read-throughs with us. [...] I guess our feeling was that because of the relationship between [...] and Olivia in Peep Show, to have taken that same relationship, {{it would have been a}} really weird thing for the audience. [...] I must say I think she'd have been great in the part, she was great in the read-throughs, I just thought we couldn't have done that." [...] Mitchell admitted, the day before the film's release, that he [...] "really got into" [...] his role as Harry.|$|E
5000|$|The {{song was}} written by Goodrem, McFadden, Stuart Crichton and Tommy Lee James just after Christmas in 2006. On writing with fiancee McFadden, Goodrem said, [...] "He is such a {{brilliant}} writer. I was intimidated by his talent, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have <b>really</b> different writing styles." [...] Goodrem states that the song brought about the focus the album needed when she stated, [...] "The turning point came with the album's opening song 'Believe Again'. Before that I was feeling a little unsure {{about the direction of}} the new album. That song really turned things around for me {{in a lot of different}} ways." ...|$|R

The location was suggested by Godrich, who had used the studio to produce records by Travis and Beck and {{thought it would be}} a [...] "good change of scenery" [...] for Radiohead. Yorke said: [...] "We were like, 'Do we want to fly halfway around the world to do this?' But it was terrific, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> worked <b>really</b> hard. <b>We</b> did a track a day.
