5|$|A {{saprophytic}} fungus, H. aurantiaca obtains {{nutrients from}} forest litter and decomposing wood, causing a <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> {{on the wood}} upon which it grows. A Finnish field study on tree stumps in a forest near Helsinki found that the species colonised them after 6–7 years.|$|E
5|$|Collectively, Hygrophoropsis is a {{widespread}} genus, found in both Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis aurantiaca is the most widely distributed species, found on several continents. The other species are not well-known and have more limited ranges. Fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, and peat, and on woodchips. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus, and causes <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> in the wood it colonises. Some species may be facultatively mycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} found in the Pacific Northwest region of North America where it grows on large (at least 1m diameter) {{specimens}} of noble fir (Abies procera), Pacific silver fir (Abies amabilis), or western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Bridgeoporus nobilissimus causes a <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> in its tree hosts. Genetic analysis shows that the fungus is more prevalent than fruit body distribution indicates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> has {{the uncanny}} ability to produce yield loss even without obvious symptoms. Due to this and its {{economic}} significance, management of <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> {{has focused on the}} area of prevention. The resistant forms soybean are currently effective against all strains of <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot,</b> and thus this is a very effective method of management. Commercial soy plant resistance varieties of <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> have been successful in the field. Fungicides are not available.|$|R
50|$|The Fomitopsidaceae are {{a family}} of fungi in the order Polyporales. Most species are {{parasitic}} on woody plants, and tend to cause <b>brown</b> <b>rots.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Brown</b> Stem <b>Rot</b> of {{soybeans}} is {{a source}} of major crop loss. It is not uncommon for soybeans grown in management systems prone for <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> to have yield losses between 10%, with a maximum potential loss of 30%. It has been listed as the 3rd most important disease to soybeans in Wisconsin. A recent study showed that nearly half the counties in Iowa, from 2006 and 2007, had <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> of soybean.|$|R
5|$|There are 16 {{accepted}} {{species of}} Hygrophoropsis, found {{in both the}} Northern and Southern Hemispheres. Hygrophoropsis is a saprophytic genus that causes <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> in the wood it colonises. The fruit bodies grow {{on the ground in}} woodlands, on moss, peat, and on woodchips. They are convex to infundibuliform (funnel-shaped) and have decurrent, forked brightly colored gills. The spores are dextrinoid, meaning that they stain reddish-brown in Melzer's reagent. Because H.aurantiaca has orange gills, it has been mistaken for a chanterelle, and hence it has been called a false chanterelle.|$|E
25|$|Peach {{trees are}} prone to a disease called leaf curl, which usually does not {{directly}} affect the fruit, but does reduce the crop yield by partially defoliating the tree. Several fungicides {{can be used to}} combat the disease, including Bordeaux mixture and other copper-based products (the University of California considers these organic treatments), ziram, chlorothalonil, and dodine. The fruit is susceptible to <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> or a dark reddish spot.|$|E
2500|$|Along some {{trails in}} the Caribou, hikers {{will see a}} timber-destroying (causes <b>brown</b> <b>rot)</b> [...] pore fungi called the red-belt fomes. [...] It is a white and yellow fungi on the bark of both white fir and red fir trees. [...] An {{interesting}} aspect of red-belt fomes {{is that it has}} a laquared feel if touched.|$|E
5000|$|Both {{strength}} {{and weight loss}} occur with white rot decay, causing the 'punky' area often referred to by woodworkers. <b>Brown</b> <b>rots,</b> the 'unpleasing' type of spalting, do not degrade lignin, thus creating a crumbly, cracked surface which cannot be stabilized. [...] Both types of rot, if left uncontrolled, will turn wood useless.|$|R
30|$|Pieces were {{classified}} as either sound (undecomposed, including charred tree remains generally equivalent to stages 1 and 2 of Maser and Trappe [1984]), or decayed (crumbly, <b>brown</b> cubicle <b>rot</b> present with structural materials, and crumbly <b>brown</b> cubical <b>rot</b> only, no structure remaining generally equivalent to stages 3, 4, and 5 of Maser and Trappe [1984]).|$|R

2500|$|Daedalea quercina is {{a species}} of {{mushroom}} in the order Polyporales, and the type species of the genus Daedalea. Commonly known as the oak mazegill or maze-gill fungus, the specific epithet refers to the oak genus Quercus, upon which it frequently grows, causing a <b>brown</b> <b>rot.</b> It is found in Europe, Asia, Northern Africa and Australasia. [...] Though inedible, {{it can be used}} as a natural comb and has been the subject of chemical research.|$|E
2500|$|Generally, {{the cherry}} {{can be a}} {{difficult}} fruit tree to grow and keep alive. [...] In Europe, the first visible pest in the growing season soon after blossom (in April in western Europe) usually is the black cherry aphid ("cherry blackfly", Myzus cerasi), which causes leaves at the tips of branches to curl, with the blackfly colonies exuding a sticky secretion which promotes fungal growth on the leaves and fruit. At the fruiting stage in June/July (Europe), the cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis cingulata and Rhagoletis cerasi) lays its eggs in the immature fruit, whereafter its larvae feed on the cherry flesh and exit through a small hole (about 1 mm diameter), {{which in turn is}} the entry point for fungal infection of the cherry fruit after rainfall. In addition, cherry trees are susceptible to bacterial canker, cytospora canker, <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> of the fruit, root rot from overly wet soil, crown rot, and several viruses.|$|E
50|$|Damage from <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> occurs {{several years}} after the {{infection}} strikes. The primary symptom is fruiting spur loss. <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> was first discovered on California almonds in the late 19th century and currently affects most almond-producing areas of California. <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> can be controlled using fungicides through bloom {{in order to protect}} the flower parts from <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> attacks. Experiments have demonstrated that 44% of twigs were infected with <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> when crops were left untreated compared to only 4% when the crop was treated.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{symptoms}} of <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> are stunting, premature death, decrease in seed number, reduced pod set, and decrease in seed size.|$|R
50|$|Pseudomonas fuscovaginae is a fluorescent, Gram-negative soil {{bacterium}} that is pathogenic to rice, causing <b>brown</b> sheath <b>rot.</b> The type strain is CCUG 32780.|$|R
50|$|Soil pH {{has been}} shown to have an effect on <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot.</b> Maintaining a soil pH of 7.0 reduces the risk of disease the greatest.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to this, <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> {{has been shown}} to be of serious economic importance even though it has been harder to estimate. <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> can cause detrimental losses to stone fruits in very wet seasons during flowering or immediately pre-harvest. <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> mostly occurs on maturing fruit close to harvest. Moreover, these losses may occur to fruit after postharvest. For example, post harvest decay of fruits have been approximated to be about 9% loss during transporting and marketing just in the US.|$|E
50|$|There {{are very}} few <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> fungi in {{tropical}} climates or in southern temperate zones. Most <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> fungi have a geographical range north of the Tropic of Cancer (23.5° latitude), {{and most of these}} are found north of the 35° latitude, corresponding to a roughly boreal distribution. Those <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> fungi between latitudes 23.5° and 35° are typically found at high elevations in pine forest regions, or in coniferous forest regions such as the Rocky Mountains or the Himalayas.|$|E
5000|$|Throughout {{the entire}} world, <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> {{is arguably the}} most common reason for crop loss of stone fruits both before and after harvest, {{especially}} in regions with warmer temperatures and wet climates.5 This disease has actually been shown to have a variety of incidence from year to year due to environmental variation. Before the discovery of extremely effective fungicides, when fruit ripened during a period of high rainfall, there were significant losses due to <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> blossom blight.5 After centuries of studying this disease in both Europe and North America, the use of fungicides have more recently become effective. Demethylation inhibitor (DMI) fungicides and Benzimidazole (BZI) fungicides are both examples are common fungicides that have been used to treat <b>brown</b> <b>rot.</b> However, since the beginning of these fungicides, another set of problems arose. After time, <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> has become resistant to a few fungicides including both DMI and BZI. Luckily, scientists have been able to develop strategies for managing or delaying fungicide resistance to <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> blossom blight.6 ...|$|E

50|$|Fungal and {{bacterial}} {{diseases of the}} adzuki bean are powdery mildew, <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> and bacterial blight. Furthermore, pests as adzuki pod worm, Japanese butterbur borer and cutworm attack the crop. Bean weevil is an important storage pest.|$|R
50|$|Laetiporus sulphureus is a {{saprophyte}} {{and occasionally}} a weak parasite, causing <b>brown</b> cubical <b>rot</b> in the heartwood of trees {{on which it}} grows. Unlike many bracket fungi, it is edible when young, although adverse reactions have been reported.|$|R

50|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> in a dry, crumbly {{condition}} is sometimes incorrectly {{referred to as}} dry rot in general. The term <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> replaced the general {{use of the term}} dry rot, as wood must be damp to decay, although it may become dry later. Dry rot is a generic name for certain species of brown-rot fungus.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> causes blossom blight, twig blight; {{twig canker}} and fruit rot. [...] <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> {{is caused by}} a fungus that {{produces}} spores, and can be a major problem during particularly wet seasons. Prolonged wet weather during bloom may result in extensive blossom infection. The length of wet periods required for blossom infection depends upon the temperature. Humid wet conditions are when the fruit trees are most at risk from infection. Young green fruit can be infected just before autumn, but the infection often remains inactive until near maturity of the fruit. <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> can spread after harvest. Mature fruit can decay in only 2 days under warm conditions.|$|E
50|$|They cause seed {{decay and}} pre- and post-emergence damping {{off when the}} soil is flooded after planting. Seedling roots may appear to have light <b>brown</b> soft <b>rot</b> {{as soon as the}} {{seedlings}} begin to sprout from the soil.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{efficient}} wood degraders are saprotrophic ascomycetes and basidiomycetes. Traditionally, these fungi {{are classified}} as <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> (Ascomycota and Basidiomycota), white rot (Basidiomycota) and soft rot (Ascomycota) based on {{the appearance of the}} decaying material. <b>Brown</b> <b>rot</b> fungi preferentially attack cellulose and hemicellulose; while white rot fungi degrade cellulose and lignin. To degrade cellulose, basidiomycetes employ hydrolytic enzymes, such as endoglucanases, cellobiohydrolase and β-glucosidase. [...] Production of endoglucanases is widely distributed among fungi and cellobiohydrolases have been isolated in multiple white-rot fungi and in plant pathogens. β-glucosidases are secreted by many wood-rotting fungi, both white and <b>brown</b> <b>rot</b> fungi, mycorrhizal fungi [...] and in plant pathogens. In addition to cellulose, β-glucosidases can cleave xylose, mannose and galactose.|$|E

40|$|The {{prevalence}} of <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> (caused by Phialophora gregata), Heterodera glycines, and Phytophthora sojae {{in the north}} central United States was investigated during the fall of 1995 and 1996. Soybean fields were randomly selected using an area-frame sampling design {{in collaboration with the}} National Agricultural Statistics Service. Soil and soybean stem samples, along with tillage information, were collected from 1, 462 fields in Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, and Ohio. An additional 275 soil samples collected from Indiana were assessed for H. glycines. For each field, the incidence and {{prevalence of}} <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> was assessed in 20 soybean stem pieces. The prevalence and recovery (expressed as the percentage of leaf disks colonized) of P. sojae and the prevalence and population densities of H. glycines were determined from the soil samples. The prevalence of <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> ranged from 28 % in Missouri to 73 % in Illinois; 68 and 72 % of the fields in Minnesota and Iowa, respectively, showed symptomatic samples. The incidence of <b>brown</b> stem <b>rot</b> was greater in conservation-till than in conventional-till fields in all states except Minnesota, which had few no-till fields. P. sojae was detected in two-thirds of the soybean fields in Ohio and Minnesota, whereas 63, 55, and 41 % of the fields in Iowa, Missouri, and Illinois, respectively, were infested with the pathogen. The recovery rates of P. sojae were significantly greater (P ≤ 0. 05) in conservation-till than in conventional-till fields in all states except Iowa.
