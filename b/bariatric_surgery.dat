5|$|In {{people with}} stable OHS, the most {{important}} treatment is weight loss—by diet, through exercise, with medication, or sometimes weight loss surgery (<b>bariatric</b> <b>surgery).</b> This {{has been shown to}} improve the symptoms of OHS and resolution of the high carbon dioxide levels. Weight loss may take a long time and is not always successful. <b>Bariatric</b> <b>surgery</b> is avoided if possible, given the high rate of complications, but may be considered if other treatment modalities are ineffective in improving oxygen levels and symptoms. If the symptoms are significant, nighttime positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment is tried; this involves the use of a machine to assist with breathing. PAP exists in various forms, and the ideal strategy is uncertain. Some medications have been tried to stimulate breathing or correct underlying abnormalities; their benefit is again uncertain.|$|E

40|$|Obesity is {{increasing}} vastly in the world, {{and the number}} of <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgeries</b> being performed is also increasing. Patients being submitted to <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgeries,</b> especially malabsorptive procedures, have an increased risk of developing nutrient deficiencies, which can culminate in symptomatic hypovitaminosis, if supplementation is not done correctly. The eye and the optic system need an adequate level of several vitamins and minerals to perform properly, especially vitamin A, and this article wants to cover the main nutrients involved, the possible ophthalmic complications that can arise by their deficiency, and the management of those complications...|$|R
5|$|The most {{effective}} treatment for obesity is <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgery.</b> The types of procedures include laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, vertical-sleeve gastrectomy, and biliopancreatic diversion. Surgery for severe obesity {{is associated with}} long-term weight loss, improvement in obesity related conditions, and decreased overall mortality. One study found a weight loss of between 14% and 25% (depending {{on the type of}} procedure performed) at 10years, and a 29% reduction in all cause mortality when compared to standard weight loss measures. Complications occur in about 17% of cases and reoperation is needed in 7% of cases. Due to its cost and risks, researchers are searching for other effective yet less invasive treatments including devices that occupy space in the stomach.|$|E
5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} is not {{a simple}} procedure and the consequences of failure are grave. Therefore, the patient is carefully evaluated for potential difficulty or complications beforehand. This involves taking the medical history of the patient and performing a physical examination, the results of which can be scored against one of several classification systems. The proposed surgical procedure (e.g., surgery involving the head and neck, or <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgery)</b> may lead one to anticipate difficulties with intubation. Many individuals have unusual airway anatomy, such as those who have limited movement of their neck or jaw, or those who have tumors, deep swelling due to injury or to allergy, developmental abnormalities of the jaw, or excess fatty tissue of the face and neck. Using conventional laryngoscopic techniques, intubation of the trachea can be difficult or even impossible in such patients. This is why all persons performing tracheal intubation must be familiar with alternative techniques of securing the airway. Use of the flexible fiberoptic bronchoscope and similar devices has become among the preferred techniques in the management of such cases. However, these devices require a different skill set than that employed for conventional laryngoscopy and are expensive to purchase, maintain and repair.|$|E

30|$|There are {{number of}} <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgeries</b> that are {{performed}} on elderly population. However, {{it is difficult}} to say which surgery provides better weight loss with less morbidity in these population. Studies in the past have shown that laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) has better weight loss than laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB) in elderly population (O’Keefe et al. 2010; Giordano and Victorzon 2015). But there is no published literature about the efficacy of single anastomosis duodenal switch (SADS) in the elderly population. The objective {{of the present study was}} to analyze and compare the outcomes in terms of weight loss and perioperative and postoperative morbidity of different <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgeries</b> in patients older than 70  years.|$|R

Dr. Goel has been a supporter for insurance companies to insure and cover the weight loss surgery.|$|R
50|$|In {{the short}} term, weight loss from <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgeries</b> is {{associated}} with reductions in some comorbidities of obesity, such as diabetes, metabolic syndrome and sleep apnea, but the benefit for hypertension is uncertain. It is uncertain whether any given bariatric procedure {{is more effective than}} another in controlling comorbidities. There is no high quality evidence concerning longer-term effects compared with conventional treatment on comorbidities.|$|R
25|$|Gastric {{bypass surgery}} not only reduces the gut's {{capacity}} for food but also dramatically lowers ghrelin levels compared to both lean controls {{and those that}} lost weight through dieting alone. However, studies are conflicting {{as to whether or}} not ghrelin levels return to nearly normal with gastric bypass patients in the long term after weight loss has stabilized. <b>Bariatric</b> <b>surgeries</b> involving vertical sleeve gastrectomy reduce plasma ghrelin levels by about 60% in the long term.|$|R

Potential avenues for further research would include analyzing the relative efficacy of these <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgeries</b> in patients older than 70  years of age as compared with obese younger population, given that the former may have a greater burden of acquired obesity-related comorbidities.|$|R
30|$|<b>Bariatric</b> <b>surgeries</b> are a vast {{subject and}} may be {{classified}} as restrictive, malabsorptive or mixed. Restrictive procedures involve {{the creation of a}} small gastric pouch which induces weight loss through satiety. Examples include adjustable gastric banding and vertical-banded gastroplasty. Malabsorptive procedures bypass portions of the small bowel, limiting the digestive processes and absorption to a short segment of ileum. Examples of malabsorptive surgeries include the jejuno-ileal bypass, abandoned because of the severe malnutrition it induces, and biliopancreatic diversion with or without a duodenal switch, which has been slow to gain popularity. Mixed procedures are a combination of both [3].|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: No {{therapeutic}} {{approach has}} significantly impacted {{the progression of}} diabetes. As early improvement of glicaemic control is observed after <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgeries,</b> there is currently a search for surgical procedures that can promote euglycemia also in non-obese patients. Glicaemic control {{can be achieved by}} increasing the blood concentration of GLP- 1, a hormone produced by L cells that are more densely concentrated in the terminal ileum. The interposition of ileal segment to a more anterior region (proximal jejunum) can promote a greater stimulation of the L cells by poorly digested food, increasing the production of GLP- 1 and reflecting on glicaemic control. |$|R
25|$|This is a {{relatively}} new specialty dealing with minimal access techniques using cameras and small instruments inserted through 0.3 to 1cm incisions. Robotic surgery is now evolving from this concept (see below). Gallbladders, appendices, and colons can all be removed with this technique. Hernias are now repaired mostly laparoscopically. Most <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgery</b> is performed laparoscopically. General surgeons that are trained today are expected to be proficient in laparoscopic procedures.|$|E

25|$|Mortality and {{complications}} {{are affected}} by pre-existing risk factors such as degree of obesity, heart disease, obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and history of prior pulmonary embolism. It is also affected by {{the experience of the}} operating surgeon: the learning curve for laparoscopic <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgery</b> is estimated to be about 100 cases. Supervision and experience is important when selecting a surgeon, as the way a surgeon becomes experienced in dealing with problems is by encountering and solving them.|$|E

50|$|Korsakoff's {{syndrome}} is {{a manifestation of}} Wernicke's encephalopathy observed in long-term abusers of alcohol. It is rare among other patients, but, for example, some cases have been observed after <b>bariatric</b> <b>surgeries,</b> when deficiency was not prevented by use of nutritional supplements. This neurological disorder {{is caused by a}} lack of thiamine (vitamin B1) in the brain, and is also often exacerbated by the neurotoxic effects of alcohol. When Wernicke's encephalopathy accompanies Korsakoff's syndrome the combination is called the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome; however, a recognized episode of Wernicke's is not always obvious. The {{syndrome is}} named after Sergei Korsakoff, a Russian neuropsychiatrist who discovered the syndrome during the late 19th century.|$|R
