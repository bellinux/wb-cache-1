40|$|For {{installing}} many sensors in {{a limited}} space with a limited computing resource, the digitization of the sensor output {{at the site of}} sensation has advantages such as a small amount of wiring, low signal interference and high scalability. For this purpose, we have developed a dedicated Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) Large-Scale Integration (LSI) (referred to as “sensor platform LSI”) for bus-networked Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) -LSI integrated sensors. In this LSI, collision avoidance, adaptation and event-driven functions are simply implemented to relieve data collision and congestion in asynchronous serial bus communication.

In such networks, Controller Area Network (CAN) messages related to automotive control {{can be sent}} from a CAN network to other sub-networks via the <b>backbone</b> Ethernet <b>bus</b> and, if the CAN messages have real-time constraints, these have to be guaranteed. This paper presents a simulation environment for CAN [...] Ethernet Audio Video Bridging (AVB) mixed networks based on OMNeT++. We use Ethernet AVB, which can guarantee network bandwidth, to improve the real-time property of CAN messages through the <b>backbone</b> Ethernet <b>bus.</b> To simulate the networks, we also developed a CAN [...] Ethernet AVB gateway (GW) model. To verify the efficacy of our model, we measured the latency of CAN messages sent from a CAN bus to an Ethernet AVB node via the <b>backbone</b> Ethernet AVB <b>bus</b> in both bandwidth-guaranteed and best-effort queue scenarios.

Service-oriented computing (SOC) {{is a means}} towards businessprocess automation and recently, many industry standards emerged {{to become part of}} the service-oriented architecture (SOA) stack. In a globalized world, organizations face new challenges for setting up and carrying out collaborations in semi-automating ecosystems for business services. For being efficient and effective, many companies express their services electronically in what we term business-process as a service (BPaaS). Companies then source BPaaS on the fly from third parties if they are not able to create all service-value inhouse because of reasons such as lack of reasoures, lack of know-how, cost- and time-reduction needs. Thus, a need emerges for BPaaS-HUBs that not only store service offers and requests together with information about their issuing organizations and assigned owners, but that also allow an evaluation of trust and reputation in an anonymized electronic service marketplace. In this paper, we analyze the requirements, design architecture and system behavior of such a BPaaS-HUB to enable a fast setup and enactment of business-process collaboration. Moving into a cloud-computing setting, the results of this paper allow system designers to quickly evaluate which services they need for instantiationg the BPaaS-HUB architecture.

Several high speed interconnect technologies, among them Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), Fibre Channel, ATM, IEEE 1394 (Firewire) and Fast Ethernet are competing to replace 1553.

40|$|The {{world at}} large is passing through a phase of energy {{transformation}} – from a traditional centralized unidirectional to a decentralized and distributed bidirectional power system, with consumers becoming prosumers. Facilitated by the technological advancements in power electronics and growing concerns over climatic changes, this transformation lead to increasing deployment of renewable energy sources. All these converge {{to the evolution of}} a concept – Microgrid, which empowers Smart Grid of the Future. In the thesis, the concept of Cell, a microgrid comprising of Distributed renewable energy sources like solar, wind etc., Battery energy storage systems and Controllable loads is conceived. Devoid of use of any communication equipment, the Cell relies on measurements of local variables for evaluating the State of Energy and Power. The primary focus is on the formulation of control strategy based on droop control that enables a seamless (dis) connection of Cell with External Grid, with still maintaining the operation of converter in voltage source mode. This control scheme is further extended for connection and disconnection of multiple Cells interconnected through a <b>Backbone</b> <b>bus,</b> referred to as Interconnected mode. Adding to this, a decision-making algorithm is developed for an autonomous operation of Cells, that determines the switching instants between Stand-alone and Interconnected modes. The developed control strategy and automated decision-making algorithm was simulated in DIgSILENT PowerFactory software for varied scenarios to evaluate the performance and the overall stability of the system. The simulations show a seamless transition between different operating modes – Stand-alone, Interconnected and Grid-connected and the automated decision-making algorithm succeeded in achieving overall stability, increasing the reliability of power to end consumers. Experiments were performed on a standard converter to prove the practical implementation capability of the developed control scheme as an intermediate interface. The modular and distributed nature of the developed controls and algorithm, makes it's advantageous to apply such Cells to electrify remote areas, which have limited or no access to power. The system can be easily scaled and expanded by adding more Cells, to build a strong and robust microgrid network. CSGRiPSustainable Energy Technolog...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{growth in}} {{electricity}} demand, increasing awareness for {{global warming and}} other en- vironmental issues have triggered attention to {{a new type of}} electricity generation-the so-called distributed generation consisting of various renewable energy sources. Despite the technological, economic and environmental benefits that the new generation system brings about, intermittent and uncontrollable nature of the renewable energy sources creates new type of challenges. The emergence of microgrids, prompted by such background, can offer a platform for effective integra- tion of distributed generation systems. In this thesis, two microgrids network interconnected through a <b>backbone</b> <b>bus</b> is developed. The main feature of this system is the absence of ICT infrastructure. Instead, the so-called droop con- trol is used to regulate power outputs among the interconnected microgrids; frequency information obtained from local measurements, is the only signal used for communications. Within this context, the thesis focuses on improvements of issues related to short-term dynamics of the droop control. To be more specific, it concerns the seamless transitions between islanded and backbone connected mode. The novel advanced controllers were developed in order to en- able these seamless transitions. They also aim to overcome the challenges found in the previous works within the same project. Three main functions exist in the controllers implemented for this thesis: synchronisation, seamless intentional(planned) and unintentional(unplanned) islanding. These developed controllers were verified and validated through both simulations and experimen- tal analysis. A significantly improved synchronisation performance was found, {{with the use of the}} newly introduced Synchronous Reference Frame-Phase Locked Loop (SRF-PLL) method. A fine tun- ing of the control parameters for voltage source inveters helped to shorten the preparation time for planned islandings. Last but not least, the introduction of the fuzzy droop controller reduced tran- sients in the microgrids during unexpected disconnections. The software platform used for the development was LabVIEW, and GPIC FPGA was utilised as the hardware platform. The functionality of the controllers were tested under several base and extreme case studies and scenarios. The results were compared to that of the previous controllers and the agreement between simulation and experimental results were evaluated. CSGRiPSustainable Energy Technolog...|$|E

The positioning accuracy, being dependent {{on the size of}} the subnets, is analyzed using simulation results which are based on empirical signal strength values. One mayor achievement of the distributed approach is a nearly unchanged positioning accuracy as the most significant system evaluation criterion. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} our {{experiences}} and {{findings on the}} design of a fault-tolerant bus architecture comprised of two COTS buses, the IEEE 1394 and the 12 C. This fault-tolerant <b>bus</b> is the <b>backbone</b> system <b>bus</b> for the avionics architecture of the X 2000 program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. COTS buses are attractive because of the availability of low cost commercial products. However, they are not specifically designed for highly reliable applications such as long-life deep-space missions. The X 2000 design team has devised a multi-level fault tolerance approach to compensate for this shortcoming of COTS buses. First, the approach enhances the fault tolerance capabilities of the IEEE 1394 and 12 C buses by adding a layer of fault handling hardware and software. Second, algorithms are developed to enable the IEEE 1394 and the 12 C buses assist each other to isolate and recovery from faults. Third, the set of IEEE 1394 and 12 C buses is duplicated to further enhance system reliability. The X 2000 design team has paid special attention to guarantee that all fault tolerance provisions will not cause the bus design to deviate from the commercial standard specifications. Otherwise, the economic attractiveness of using COTS will be diminished. The hardware and software design of the X 2000 fault-tolerant bus are being implemented and flight hardware will be delivered to the ST 4 and Europa Orbiter missions...|$|R
40|$|In {{high-density}} contexts, such {{as urban}} or metropolitan areas, decision makers and mobility managers have to adopt suitable strategies {{to reduce the}} use of private cars and promote public transport. Indeed, such strategies may help abate the negative impacts of transportation systems (congestion, air and noise pollution, etc.). However, appropriate measures are only effective if based on the provision of high quality public transport services. Such aims {{can be achieved by}} organising public transport within an integrated framework where rail/metro services are the high-performing mobility <b>backbone</b> and <b>bus</b> services have a feeder function, increasing the geographical coverage of rail services. However, since a faulty train cannot be easily removed or overtaken, a rail/metro system is highly vulnerable to system breakdowns which could entail significant reductions in system quality.

The aim {{of this paper is to}} provide a method to determine optimal intervention strategies in the case of a metro system failure. Since in real contexts an exhaustive approach has to be excluded due to the huge number of alternative solutions to be evaluated, it is necessary to adopt or develop appropriate algorithms to obtain sub-optimal solutions within suitable computational times.

Most existent formal verification techniques are extremely computation intensive and produce good results only when used on individual sub-components of SoCs.

We attack the problem of SoC verification using an elegant abstraction mechanism, called computation slicing, and show that it enables effective temporal property verification on large designs. The technique targets a set of execution sequences, that is exhaustive with respect to an intended subset of system level properties, and automatically finds counter-example execution sequences in case of errors in the design. We have obtained exponential gains in reducing the global state space using a polynomial-time algorithm, and also applied a polynomial-time algorithm for checking global liveness and safety properties.
