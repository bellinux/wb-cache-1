After successfully negotiating a new contract till 30 June 2010, he was greeted with news of the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first child, Tobias Del Piero.

5|$|Increasing {{professional}} obligations {{after the}} <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> first son in 1987 {{coincided with a}} reduction in his literary output. During the 1990s he instead focused his attention on his novel Feuers Geraun. Two early versions of this novel's chapters were published by the Upper Austrian magazine die Rampe in 1994 (Der Schreiber von Aram) and 1997 (Das Gesetz). These chapters deal with Jewish and biblical traditions. The publishing list on Ebner's website lists only six publications in anthologies by 2004, but seventeen are listed from between 2005 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Later that year, Drusus {{was married}} to his {{paternal}} cousin, Livilla, to bring him closer to the Julians. Tacitus says she was unattractive as a child, but {{grew up to be}} beautiful.

5|$|As {{a tribute}} to his then-pregnant wife, Ilary Blasi, Totti imitated a {{childbirth}} scene by stuffing the ball under his shirt and {{lying on his back}} while his teammates extracted the ball. His current ritual of sucking his thumb after a goal began after his son was born and continued after the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter. Blasi has revealed that Totti also sucks his thumb in dedication to her and not just for their children. On 11 January 2015, Totti scored twice against Lazio in the Derby della Capitale as Roma came back from 2–0 down; he then took a selfie with Roma fans.|$|E

5|$|Crittenden's {{support of}} a new {{election}} was both popular and politically expedient. When the U.S. Senate term of Martin D. Hardin, one of Slaughter's unpopular nominees, expired in 1817, the Kentucky General Assembly chose Crittenden to fill the vacancy. Though he was {{the youngest member of}} the body, he served as the second-ever chairman of the newly created Committee on the Judiciary. He was {{also a member of the}} Committee on Naval Affairs. During his term, he introduced legislation to reimburse and indemnify persons who were fined under the 1798 Sedition Act. He found state politics more interesting, however, and this fact, coupled with increased financial responsibilities incurred by the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> third and fourth children, prompted his decision to resign his seat on March 3, 1819.|$|E
5|$|Echoes, Silence, Patience & Grace is {{the sixth}} studio album by rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on September 25, 2007 by RCA Records.

It also marks the second time the band worked with producer Gil Norton, whom frontman Dave Grohl brought to fully explore the potential of his compositions and have a record that sounded different from their previous work. Grohl {{tried to focus on}} songs with messages that resonated on the audience, writing reflective lyrics which drew inspiration from the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter.|$|E

In 1782, with no treaty yet signed ending the war, Lafayette helped prepare for a combined French and Spanish expedition against the British West Indies.

She made arrangements for her will and argued with her father about where she should be buried. Matilda preferred Bec Abbey, but Henry wanted her to be interred at Rouen Cathedral.

5|$|More widely, 1936 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the Great Terror, in which many of the composer's friends and relatives were imprisoned or killed.

5|$|When the Prince of Wales {{applied to}} Parliament for an {{increase}} in his allowance, an open quarrel broke out. The king, who had a reputation for meanness, offered a private settlement, which Frederick rejected. Parliament voted against the measure, but George reluctantly increased his son's allowance on the advice of Walpole. Further friction between them followed when Frederick excluded the king and queen from the <b>birth</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> daughter in July 1737 by bundling his wife, who was in labour, into a coach and driving off {{in the middle of the}} night. George banished him and his family from the royal court, much like the punishment his own father had brought upon him with the exception that he allowed Frederick to retain custody of his children.|$|E
