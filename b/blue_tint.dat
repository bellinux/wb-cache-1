5|$|A {{spiral galaxy}} is {{organized}} into a flat, rotating disk, usually with a prominent bulge or {{bar at the}} center, and trailing bright arms that spiral outward. The arms are dusty regions of star formation within which massive young stars produce a <b>blue</b> <b>tint.</b> Spiral galaxies are typically surrounded by a halo of older stars. Both the Milky Way {{and one of our}} nearest galaxy neighbors, the Andromeda Galaxy, are spiral galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt-based blue {{pigments}} (cobalt blue) {{have been}} used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists {{to be due to}} the known metal bismuth. Miners had long used the name kobold ore (German for goblin ore) for some of the blue-pigment producing minerals; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous arsenic-containing fumes upon smelting. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the kobold.|$|E
5|$|P. R. Brown {{directed}} this video, which premiered on VH1 Classic on 8 August 2006. There are {{similarities between}} the video for Meat Loaf's version of the song, and that the video for that of Celine Dion, with Meat Loaf being haunted {{by the memory of}} his lover. It is structured differently, however, with the story being told through flashback. Shots when Raven's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint, with a darker, <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> for those after her death. Whereas the motorcyclist dies before the first verse in the Dion version, Raven's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus. Meat Loaf becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending (some reviewers have compared this to the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut).|$|E

25|$|Glacial ice has a {{distinctive}} <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> because it absorbs some red light {{due to an}} overtone of the infrared OH stretching mode of the water molecule. Liquid water is blue for the same reason. The blue of glacier ice is sometimes misattributed to Rayleigh scattering due to bubbles in the ice.|$|E
25|$|Notable {{trees in}} the {{preserve}} include valley oak and blue oak. The valley oak was once common in central California, forming large groves along rivers and streams. In grasslands, they form open savannas along with blue oaks. The valley oak is {{the largest of the}} native California oak trees and can live to be 600 years old. With a vertical root system as deep as 80 feet, it can reach groundwater levels. The blue oak tolerates dry soil and can have a root system 30 feet deep. It has a distinctive <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> in the green leaf color that can best be seen when compared to another nearby oak of a different type. The blue oak can live to be 400 years old and provides critical winter range for deer and other wildlife.|$|E
25|$|The show's opening credit {{sequence}} {{shows the}} Arthur Daley and Terry McCann characters negotiating over {{the sale of}} the white Ford Capri interspersed with still photos of the two main characters, highlighting Terry's credentials as a retired boxer and ex-convict, this presumably symbolising the characters' first meeting and the terms of their partnership. During the Dennis Waterman era, the closing credits consisted of a number of black and white (with <b>blue</b> <b>tint)</b> still photographs of Arthur and Terry together outside famous London landmarks, and a few hinting of (unseen) previous escapades typical of a standard episode plot. In the later Gary Webster series, this changed to Arthur and Ray walking along Southend Pier, over a mile long: at the end Arthur realises he has left his lighter {{at the other end of}} the pier and they start to walk back to find it.|$|E

500|$|Antimony is a silver-white solid with a <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> and a {{brilliant}} lustre. It has a density of 6.697 g/cm3 and is brittle, and moderately hard (more so than arsenic; less so than iron; {{about the same}} as copper). It is stable in air and moisture at room temperature. It is attacked by concentrated nitric acid, yielding the hydrated pentoxide Sb2O5. Aqua regia gives the pentachloride SbCl5 and hot concentrated sulfuric acid results in the sulfate Sb2(SO4)3. It is not affected by molten alkali. Antimony is capable of displacing hydrogen from water, when heated: [...] 2 Sb + 3 H2O → Sb2O3 + 3 H2. It melts at 631°C. Antimony is a semimetal with an electrical conductivity of around 3.1 × 104S•cm−1 and a band overlap of 0.16eV. Liquid antimony is a metallic conductor with an electrical conductivity of around 5.3 × 104S•cm−1.|$|E
500|$|Like other fairywrens, the red-backed fairywren {{is notable}} for its marked sexual dimorphism; the male adopts full {{breeding}} plumage {{by the fourth}} year, later than all other fairywrens apart from its relative the white-winged fairywren. The male in breeding plumage has a black head and body with striking red back and brown wings. At other times it has a brown upper body and white underparts. Some, mainly younger, males do remain in [...] plumage while breeding. The female looks remarkably similar with a buff brown body and a yellowish spot under the eye. The female of this species differs from those of other fairy wren species in that it lacks a <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> in the tail. Geographically, it follows Gloger's rule; female birds have whiter bellies and paler brown upperparts inland in sunnier climates. Juveniles of both sexes look very similar to females.|$|E
500|$|Summer Evening at Skagen. The Artist's Wife and Dog by the Shore, one of Denmark's {{most popular}} works, was painted in 1892. It shows Marie {{standing}} on the beach with Rap by her side and the moonlight reflected in the sea. She is shown in profile and her melancholy face and bright dress glow under {{the light of the}} setting sun. The painting is one of the works in which Krøyer tries to capture the light and mood on the Skagen shore during what he called [...] "l'heure bleue" [...] (the blue hour), the short period at dusk when the light casts a <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> over the landscape. The Symbolists believed the twilight hour heralded the coming of death. The moon's reflection adds a slight feeling of depth to the otherwise flat background which consists mostly of the monolithic blue sea. Marie is depicted as being at a similar height to the viewer, but the horizon rises above her head, emphasizing her radiance against the muted, nearly monochrome background.|$|E

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Power & Control" [...] {{was directed by}} Casper Balslev; it was released on 30 May 2012 as the sixth installment of her eleven-part [...] "The Archetypes" [...] video series. A <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> is applied throughout the clip; it takes place in an empty mansion, presumably the same location where the music video for [...] "Primadonna" [...] was filmed. A blonde Diamandis is seen engaging {{in a series of}} mind games with her romantic interest. Rich Juzwiak from Gawker appreciated a reference to the music video for [...] "Freedom! '90" [...] by George Michael, which he complimented as [...] "a nice touch". Bradley Stern from MuuMuse stated that the clip was [...] "absolutely gorgeous" [...] despite its simplistic concept; he enjoyed the appearance of a Newton's cradle {{in the beginning of the}} video, and felt that it represented the lyrics [...] "you can't have peace without a war" [...] by exemplifying that the concept that [...] "for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction". Writing for WhatCulture, Josh Webb thought that it was interesting to see an [...] "understated" [...] Diamandis in the clip, and stated that the overall product was an [...] "aesthetically very pleasing" [...] visual. Referencing the emptiness of the mansion, Eliot Glazer from Vulture jokingly offered to [...] "suggest an interior decorator".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Screen Rant, Alex Leadbeater felt, {{regardless}} of the short's connections to Logan and Deadpool 2, it [...] "ultimately is a good slice of Deadpool fun." [...] Leadbeater also praised the alternate online release, as pirated versions of the theatrical showings had already appeared online and the extra scenes in the official online version were incentive for fans to watch the official release over the illegal ones. Trent Moore of Blastr called the short [...] "a fun little scene", and said that Leitch [...] "certainly {{seems to have a}} solid grasp of the irreverent tone that makes the character work so well." [...] Jacob Hall at /Film said the short was a [...] "fun little surprise" [...] and compared it to Marvel Studios' Marvel One-Shots. He added that there is [...] "not much to judge quite yet, but [...] does showcase a strong eye for comedy" [...] in the footage, and particularly noted the [...] "ridiculously depressing and dilapidated" [...] setting. Corey Chichizola of CinemaBlend said the short is [...] "certainly cool enough to the wet the palate for any X-Men fans", and particularly noted the [...] "strong <b>blue</b> <b>tint,</b> which is in stark juxtaposition to the very bright and yellow world of Deadpool. With a new director stepping behind the camera, perhaps this was a choice that we'll see in" [...] Deadpool 2.|$|E
2500|$|The album artwork {{is based}} on a {{painting}} by Hendrix himself in 1957. [...] "He went through a phase doing watercolors at school and {{this was one of the}} 110 drawings of his that our father kept. When I saw this one he did in 1957, it screamed 'Valleys of Neptune' to me so we knew we'd use it for this project," [...] said his step-sister, Janie. The album artwork is a mix of his painting and a Linda McCartney photograph of him with a <b>blue</b> <b>tint.</b>|$|E

2500|$|When {{considering}} lighting for an aquarium, {{there are}} generally two factors to consider: wattage and color temperature. Depending {{on the type}} of lighting (i.e. fluorescents, metal halide, etc.) the wattage of light emitted may vary considerably, from tens of watts to several hundred watts in a lighting system. Wattage, while not indicative of color, is equivalent to power and essentially determines how brightly the light will shine. Due to the scattering of light in water, the deeper one's tank is, the more powerful the lighting required. Color temperature, measured in kelvins (albeit slightly unrepresentively) refers to the color of light being emitted by the lamp and is based on the concept of blackbody radiation. [...] Light from the sun has a color temperature of approximately 5900 K and lighting systems with color temperatures >5000 K tend to be best for growing plants in both the marine and freshwater setting. 10,000 K light appears bluish-white and emphasizes coloration in fishes and corals. Higher up on the spectrum there are 14,000 K and 20,000 K bulbs that produce a deep <b>blue</b> <b>tint</b> which mimic the lighting conditions underseas, creating an optimal ambience for invertebrates and livestock present.|$|E
2500|$|A color-measuring {{apparatus}} {{commonly used}} in experiments in the 1900s was {{used in conjunction with}} partially silvered mirrors to split one beam of light into two beams. This resulted in two beams of light parallel to one another having the same intensity and color. [...] The beams of light were projected onto a white background, creating patches of light that were [...] squares. [...] The white light was added to one of the patches of colored light, the patch on the right. [...] A rod was inserted {{in the path of the}} two beams so that there would be no space in between the colored surfaces. [...] An additional rod was used to create a shadow where the white light scattered onto the patch that was not to receive addition of white light (the patch on the left side). [...] The amount of white light added was determined as one half of the luminosity of the colored light. [...] The red light source, for example, had more white light added than the yellow light source. [...] He began using two patches of red light, and in fact, the addition of white light to the light patch on the right caused a more yellow tone than the pure red light source. [...] The same results happened when the experimental light source was orange. [...] When the light source was green, the addition of white light caused the appearance of the patch to become yellow-green. [...] Subsequently, when white light was added to yellow-green light, the patch of light appeared primarily yellow. [...] In a mixture of blue-green light (with a slightly higher percentage of blue) with white light, the blue appeared to take on a reddish hue. [...] In the case of a violet light source, the addition of white light caused the violet light to take on a <b>blue</b> <b>tint.</b>|$|E
