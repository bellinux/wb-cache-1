In response to regular stepping movement, all anticipatory saccades were {{in the direction of}} the illusion; these erroneous oblique movements were followed by corrective horizontal saccades. When the head was free to move, it usually showed a diagonal trajectory that, for both sinusoidal and stepping target motion, was always {{in the direction of the}} illusion; no corrective movements were present. Thus, for our illusory stimuli, eye and head tracking showed qualitative differences that imply that ocular tracking was ultimately controlled by actual target motion but head tracking was controlled by illusory target motion...|$|E

40|$|SummaryInflammatory {{processes}} play {{an important}} role in the pathogenesis of vascular diseases, and insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus type 2 represents an important risk factor for the development of atherosclerosis. To directly address the role of insulin resistance in myeloid lineage cells in the development of atherosclerosis, we have created mice with myeloid lineage-specific inactivation of the insulin receptor gene. On an ApoE-deficient background, MphIRKO mice developed smaller atherosclerotic lesions. There was a dramatic decrease in LPS-stimulated IL- 6 and IL- 1 β expression in the presence of macrophage autonomous insulin resistance. Consistently, while insulin-resistant IRS- 2 -deficient mice on an ApoE-deficient <b>background</b> <b>display</b> aggravated atherosclerosis, fetal liver cell transplantation of IRS- 2 −/−ApoE−/− cells ameliorated atherosclerosis in Apo-E-deficient mice. Thus, systemic versus myeloid cell-restricted insulin resistance has opposing effects on the development of atherosclerosis, providing direct evidence that myeloid lineage autonomous insulin signaling provides proinflammatory signals predisposing to the development of atherosclerosis...|$|E

40|$|Mechanisms behind how {{the immune}} system signals to the brain in {{response}} to systemic inflammation are not fully understood. Transgenic mice expressing Cre recombinase specifically in the hematopoietic lineage in a Cre reporter <b>background</b> <b>display</b> recombination and marker gene expression in Purkinje neurons. Here we show that reportergene expression in neurons is caused by intercellular transfer of functional Cre recombinase messenger RNA from immune cells into neurons {{in the absence of}} cell fusion. In vitro purified secreted extracellular vesicles (EVs) from blood cells contain Cre mRNA, which induces recombination in neurons when injected into the brain. Although Cre-mediated recombination events in the brain occur very rarely in healthy animals, their number increases considerably in different injury models, particularly under inflammatory conditions, and extend beyond Purkinje neurons to other neuronal populations in cortex, hippocampus, and substantia nigra. Recombined Purkinje neurons differ in their miRNA profile from their nonrecombined counterparts, indicating physiological significance. These observations reveal the existence of a previously unrecognized mechanism to communicate RNA-based signals between the hematopoietic system and various organs, including the brain, in response to inflammation...|$|E
