In late July 2011, NATO troops also handed control of Mazar-i-Sharif to local forces amid rising security fears just days after it {{was hit by a}} deadly bombing. Mazar-i-Sharif is the sixth of seven areas to transition to Afghan control, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> timing is political and there is skepticism over Afghan abilities to combat the Taliban insurgency.|$|E

According to The Independent, there was [...] "no suggestion that McKinsey was complicit in the subsequent scandal, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> arrogance of Enron's leaders is emblematic of the McKinsey culture." [...] The government did not investigate McKinsey, who said they did not provide advice on Enron's accounting, but some questioned whether McKinsey knew about Enron's accounting problems or ignored warning signs.|$|E
50|$|DIBELS {{has become}} a fairly widely used {{assessment}} for early reading intervention by many schools in the United States but since its development and release {{there have been many}} critics challenging the effectiveness and validity of the DIBELS assessments. One criticism has been that although the Official DIBELS homepage claims that there is an abundance of research validating the DIBELS assessments much of that was unpublished. “Of the 89 references listed, only 18 are published in professional reviewed journals in the fields of psychology, special education, or music therapy, and eight are chapters in edited books” (Nancy Rankie Shelton, 2009). Reidel (2007) has a similar criticism in saying that the DIBELS developers claim that the research base was the reason for the widespread use of the assessments, <b>but</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> political pressure to use DIBELS {{as a part of the}} Reading First Initiative was the reason for the widespread adoption. In 2005 an article by Kathleen Manzo states; DIBELS got the competitive edge because its developers and their colleagues at the University of Oregon were consultants to the U.S. Department of Education for Reading First, with one of the main developers, Mr. Good, being one of the persons who evaluated 29 early literacy tests including his own product.|$|E

I buy a rope!" [...] (Act 4, scene 1). The meaning of Dromio’s line has not been satisfactorily explained by <b>critics,</b> <b>but</b> Oxfordians <b>say</b> <b>the</b> line is somehow connected to the fact that de Vere was given a £1,000 annuity by the Queen, later continued by King James.|$|R
5000|$|Clinicians may blame {{clients for}} not being {{sufficiently}} motivated to work on treatment goals or recovery, and as [...] "acting out" [...] when things are not agreed with or are found upsetting. <b>But</b> <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> that in <b>the</b> majority of cases this is actually due to the client having been treated in a disrespectful, judgmental, or dismissive manner. Nevertheless, such behavior may be justified by characterizing the client as demanding, angry or [...] "needing limits". To overcome this, {{it has been suggested}} that power-sharing should be cultivated and that when respectful communication breaks down, the first thing that needs to be asked is whether mentalist prejudices have been expressed.|$|R
40|$|In {{what many}} {{consider}} a historic step toward changing Mexico's antiquated petroleum sector, the Congress approved legislation {{to overhaul the}} state-run oil company PEMEX. The measure was approved overwhelmingly {{in both houses of}} Congress in October, although there was some dissent within the ranks of the center-left Partido de la Revolucion Democratica (PRD). Some members of the PRD broke with their moderate colleagues because of opposition to a provision that allows PEMEX to hire private and foreign companies for key activities in the oil sector. Another key change that allows the company more control of its revenues received overwhelming support. <b>But</b> some <b>critics</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> reform plan, which was diluted from President Felipe Calderon's original proposal, is insufficient to help reverse Mexico's declining production. President Calderon first offered plan in April The proposal to overhaul PEMEX had been in the works since April of this year, when Calderon first introduced his plan to Congress. At that time, the plan met strong opposition, with legislators from opposing parties concerned that the proposal potentially violated the Mexican Constitution. Even with those concerns, Calderon pushed for the Congress to vote on the legislation to reform PEMEX in a special session during the summer months. Legislators rejected that proposal, saying they needed more time to consider an initiative with such far-reaching implications for the country. As legislators were considering the various proposals for PEMEX reform, a faction of the PRD along with allies from the Partido del Trabajo (PT) and Partido Convergencia por la Democracia (PCD) pushed to have Calderon withdraw his plan altogether. This group, which was allied with the PRD's ex-presidential candidate Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, opposed any form of private participation in PEMEX...|$|R
