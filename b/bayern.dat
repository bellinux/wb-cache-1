5|$|<b>Bayern</b> were {{immediately}} {{on the attack}} following Liverpool's goal. A foul on <b>Bayern</b> defender Bixente Lizarazu by Gerrard resulted in a free-kick for <b>Bayern.</b> The subsequent free-kick taken by Ciriaco Sforza was headed over the Liverpool goal by Pablo Thiam. Liverpool regrouped and their next attack almost resulted in another goal. Heskey's pass to Owen put him clear of the <b>Bayern</b> defence and one-on-one with Oliver Kahn. Owen attempted to chip the ball over Kahn, however the <b>Bayern</b> goalkeeper was able to save the shot. Immediately afterwards <b>Bayern</b> were on the attack. <b>Bayern</b> defender Willy Sagnol held off Riise and the crossed {{the ball into the}} penalty area, the cross was met by Giovane Élber whose header went wide of the Liverpool goal. With the first half coming to an end, Liverpool had another attack. Hamann passed the ball to Heskey {{on the edge of the}} <b>Bayern</b> penalty area, Heskey subsequently moved past <b>Bayern</b> defender's Thomas Linke and Kovač, and shot low beyond Kahn to give Liverpool a 2–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} at Borussia Dortmund, <b>Bayern</b> were coached by Ottmar Hitzfeld from 1998 to 2004. In Hitzfeld's first season, <b>Bayern</b> won the Bundesliga and {{came close to}} winning the Champions League, losing 2–1 to Manchester United into injury time after leading {{for most of the}} match. The {{following}} year, in the club's centenary season, <b>Bayern</b> won the third league and cup double in its history. A third consecutive Bundesliga title followed in 2001, won with a stoppage time goal {{on the final day of}} the league season. Days later, <b>Bayern</b> won the Champions League for the fourth time after a 25-year gap, defeating Valencia on penalties. The 2001–02 season began with a win in the Intercontinental Cup, but ended trophyless otherwise. In 2002–03, <b>Bayern</b> won their fourth double, leading the league by a record margin of 16 points. Hitzfeld's reign ended in 2004, with <b>Bayern</b> underperforming, including defeat by second division Alemannia Aachen in the DFB-Pokal.|$|E
5|$|At his {{farewell}} game, Oliver Kahn {{was declared}} honorary captain of <b>Bayern</b> Munich. The players below {{are part of}} the FC <b>Bayern</b> Munich Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bayern</b> Munich has a {{rivalry with}} Borussia Dortmund. <b>Bayern</b> and Dortmund have competed {{against each other}} for many Bundesliga titles. They also have played {{against each other in}} the DFB-Pokal final in 2008, 2012, and 2014. The 2–5 loss against Dortmund in the 2012 DFB-Pokal final was Bayern's worst ever loss in a final. <b>Bayern</b> and Dortmund have also played against each other in the DFL-Supercup in 1989, 2008, 2012, 2013, 2014 and 2016. The height of the rivalry was when <b>Bayern</b> {{defeated}} Dortmund, 2–1 in the final of the 2013 UEFA Champions League.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bayern</b> is an {{exception}} in professional, international football, having generated profits in nine of the last ten seasons. Other clubs often report losses, realizing transfers via loans, whereas <b>Bayern</b> always uses current assets. Also <b>Bayern</b> differs from other European top clubs in their income composition. While other clubs derive more than 35% of their revenues from broadcasting right, <b>Bayern</b> earn only 22% of their revenues that way. This is often accounted for by <b>Bayern</b> not marketing their broadcasting right themselves. Instead the Deutsche Fußball Liga negotiates broadcasting rights for the whole Bundesliga.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bayern</b> played {{its first}} {{training}} {{games at the}} Schyrenplatz in the centre of Munich. The first official games were held on the Theresienwiese. In 1901, <b>Bayern</b> moved to a field of its own, located in Schwabing at the Clemensstraße. After joining the Münchner Sport-Club (MSC) in 1906, <b>Bayern</b> moved in May 1907 to MSC's ground at the Leopoldstraße. As the crowds gathering for Bayern's home games increased {{at the beginning of}} the 1920s, <b>Bayern</b> had to switch to various other premises in Munich.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bayern</b> then signed Dutch manager Louis van Gaal for the 2009–10 season. Multi-million signings of Arjen Robben and Mario Gómez also {{followed}} {{in a bid}} to return <b>Bayern</b> {{to the top of the}} European scene. On 8 May 2010, <b>Bayern</b> Munich won the 2009–10 Bundesliga after a 3–1 win at Hertha BSC. <b>Bayern</b> then won the DFB-Pokal on 15 May 2010 to secure the domestic double. <b>Bayern</b> also reached the 2010 Champions League final, but were beaten 2–0 by Inter Milan, failing to become the first German club to complete the treble.|$|E
5|$|In 2011–12, <b>Bayern</b> {{reported}} {{revenues of}} €373million, marking the eighth consecutive time that <b>Bayern</b> has topped their previous record earnings. According to the 2013 edition of Deloitte's annual Football Money League, <b>Bayern</b> {{was the fourth}} richest club {{in the world in}} 2012, generating revenues of €368.4 million.|$|E
5|$|In May 2012, <b>Bayern</b> {{opened a}} museum about its history, FC <b>Bayern</b> Erlebniswelt, inside the Allianz Arena.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012–13 season, <b>Bayern</b> won the 2012 DFL-Supercup 2–1 against rivals Borussia Dortmund. <b>Bayern</b> {{became the}} first team in history to win their first eight matches in the Bundesliga after their 5–0 away win to Fortuna Düsseldorf. On 6 April 2013, <b>Bayern</b> won the 2012–13 Bundesliga after a 1–0 win at Eintracht Frankfurt with six games left, setting a new record for being the {{earliest}} ever Bundesliga winners. Other Bundesliga records set by <b>Bayern</b> in the 2012–13 season include most points in a season (91), highest league winning points margin (25), most wins in a season (29) and fewest goals conceded in a season (18). <b>Bayern</b> also equaled the record for fewest defeats in a season, losing once, to Bayer Leverkusen. <b>Bayern</b> also reached the Champions League final {{for the third time}} in four seasons, winning the club's fifth European Cup with a 2–1 defeat of domestic rivals Borussia Dortmund at Wembley Stadium. On 1 June 2013, <b>Bayern</b> beat VfB Stuttgart 3–2 in the 2013 DFB-Pokal final to become the first German club in men's football to complete the treble; <b>Bayern</b> had missed out on trebles in 1999 and 2010.|$|E
5|$|On 1 July 2013, Pep Guardiola {{took over}} as manager ahead of the 2013–14 season. <b>Bayern</b> also {{completed}} the signing of Mario Götze from Borussia Dortmund for €37million, who became the most expensive German player in history (this was later surpassed by Mesut Özil's transfer from Real Madrid to Arsenal for €50million). On 24 July 2013, {{it was reported that}} <b>Bayern</b> had become the first German club with over 200,000 members. On 27 July 2013, <b>Bayern</b> Munich lost against rivals Borussia Dortmund 2–4 in the 2013 DFL-Supercup at Signal Iduna Park. On 30 August 2013, <b>Bayern</b> won the UEFA Super Cup against Chelsea. On 9 November 2013, <b>Bayern</b> set a new record for most successive Bundesliga matches without defeat, breaking Hamburger SV's 30-year-old record of 36 matches. This record was eventually extended to 53 matches, before <b>Bayern</b> lost 1–0 to FC Augsburg in April 2014. On 27 November 2013, <b>Bayern</b> became the first team to win ten consecutive Champions League matches with a 3–1 away victory over CSKA Moscow. On 21 December 2013, <b>Bayern</b> beat Raja Casablanca 2–0 at the Stade de Marrakech to win the 2013 FIFA Club World Cup.|$|E
5|$|The four Bayern-class {{ships were}} the first super-dreadnoughts built by the German navy. The class {{comprised}} <b>Bayern,</b> Baden, Sachsen, and Württemberg. Construction started on the ships shortly before World War I; Baden was laid down in 1913, <b>Bayern</b> and Sachsen followed in 1914, and Württemberg, the final ship, was laid down in 1915. Only Baden and <b>Bayern</b> were completed, as ship building priorities shifted as the war dragged on. It was determined that U-boats were more valuable to the war effort, and so work on new battleships was slowed and ultimately stopped altogether. As a result, <b>Bayern</b> and Baden were the last German battleships completed by the Kaiserliche Marine.|$|E
5|$|After a twenty-year career, {{of which}} he played {{fourteen}} with <b>Bayern,</b> he had his professional farewell in a testimonial match versus the select Germany XI on 2 September 2008, which ended 1–1. His last appearance for <b>Bayern</b> Munich was on 27 May 2008 at the Salt Lake Stadium (Yuvabharati Krirangan), Kolkata in a friendly against Mohun Bagan of India during Bayern's Asian tour of 2008. Around 120,000 people turned up for the match. The match ended 0–3 in favour of <b>Bayern</b> and Michael Rensing substituted him in the 55th minute.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost a}} year of {{investigations}} against Uli Hoeneß, Bayern's former player, former long-time general manager, and president at the time, {{he was convicted of}} tax evasion on 13 March 2014. Hoeneß resigned as president the next day, and Karl Hopfner was elected president on 2 May. Just days after Hoeneß conviction, on 25 March, <b>Bayern</b> won their 24th Bundesliga title by beating Hertha BSC 3–1 at the Olympiastadion in Berlin. With seven matches remaining in the season, it was the earliest the championship had been won in Bundesliga history, breaking the record <b>Bayern</b> had set in the previous season. At {{the end of the season}} <b>Bayern</b> beat Borussia Dortmund 2–0 in the 2014 DFB-Pokal Final to give the club the tenth league and cup double in its history. In 2014–15, <b>Bayern</b> defended their league title, and, the following season, won an 11th double, including a record fourth consecutive Bundesliga title. At the end of the 2015–16 season, Guardiola left <b>Bayern</b> to take over as manager of Manchester City and was replaced by Carlo Ancelotti.|$|E
5|$|After the war, <b>Bayern</b> {{became a}} member of the Oberliga Süd, the {{southern}} conference of the German first division, which was split five ways at that time. <b>Bayern</b> struggled, hiring and firing 13 coaches between 1945 and 1963. Landauer returned from exile in 1947 and was once again appointed club president, the tenure lasted until 1951. He remains as the club's president with the longest accumulated tenure. Landauer has been deemed as inventor of <b>Bayern</b> as a professional club and his memory is being upheld by the <b>Bayern</b> ultras Schickeria. In 1955, the club was relegated but returned to the Oberliga in the following season and won the DFB-Pokal for the first time, beating Fortuna Düsseldorf 1–0 in the final. The club struggled financially though, verging on bankruptcy at the end of the 1950s. Manufacturer Roland Endler provided the necessary funds and was rewarded with four years at the helm of the club. In 1963, the Oberligas in Germany were consolidated into one national league, the Bundesliga. Five teams from the Oberliga South were admitted. <b>Bayern</b> finished third in that year's southern division, but another Munich team, 1860 Munich, had won the championship. As the DFB preferred not to include two teams from one city, <b>Bayern</b> was not chosen for the Bundesliga. They gained promotion two years later, fielding a team with young talents like Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd Müller and Sepp Maier— who would later be collectively referred to as the axis.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} against <b>Bayern</b> Munich in the {{knockout}} stages. In {{the first leg}} a mistake from Touré presented Claudio Pizarro to score inside four minutes. The striker then scored his second of the match in the 58th minute, getting past his marker Touré, and Hasan Salihamidžić added a third for <b>Bayern</b> seven minutes later. Touré scored an away goal late on for Arsenal, which gave them a slender chance of progressing into the quarter-finals. Arsenal beat <b>Bayern</b> in the second leg, but a solitary goal – scored by Henry in the 66th minute, meant the club was eliminated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bayern</b> coach Ottmar Hitzfeld {{announced}} his team's line-up {{for the final}} two full days ahead of the match. Injuries also impacted on his selections, with French left-back Bixente Lizarazu and Brazilian forward Élber having suffered season-ending knee injuries. Élber's absence resulted in <b>Bayern</b> playing a three-man attack of Mario Basler, Carsten Jancker and Alexander Zickler, while Lizarazu was replaced on the left flank by Michael Tarnat playing in a wing-back role opposite Markus Babbel on the right. Babbel was originally intended to play a man-marking role on Ryan Giggs, with his defensive abilities earning him selection ahead of the more attack-minded Thomas Strunz; however, this was nullified by Giggs' selection on the right wing, where he would play against Tarnat. The <b>Bayern</b> defence was anchored around sweeper Lothar Matthäus, who played behind Thomas Linke and Ghana international Samuel Kuffour – the only non-German in the <b>Bayern</b> side (by comparison, Manchester United had four Englishmen in their team); Linke and Kuffour's partnership at centre-back meant club captain Thomas Helmer {{had to settle for}} a place on the bench. Stefan Effenberg and Jens Jeremies played in central midfield for <b>Bayern,</b> with Jeremies man-marking David Beckham.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bayern</b> {{has other}} {{departments}} {{for a variety}} of sports.|$|E
5|$|Both <b>Bayern</b> and Baden were interned in Scapa Flow {{following}} the Armistice in November 1918. Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter, {{the commander of}} the interned German fleet, ordered his ships be sunk on 21 June 1919; <b>Bayern</b> was successfully scuttled, though British guards managed to beach Baden to prevent her from sinking. The ship was eventually expended as a gunnery target in 1921. Sachsen and Württemberg, both at various stages of completion when the war ended, were broken up for scrap metal. <b>Bayern</b> was raised in 1934 and broken up the following year.|$|E
5|$|FC <b>Bayern</b> Munich {{training}} facilities, {{for both}} the professional and the Junior Team, are located at the <b>Bayern</b> Munich Headquarters. There are four grass pitches, one of which has undersoil heating, one artificial grass field and a multi-functional sports hall. After the closure of Munich American High School, FC <b>Bayern</b> purchased the DoDDS adjacent sporting fields that previously held MAHS's football pitch and baseball field. A new grass pitch was placed over the existing football pitch while an artificial turf field was placed over the baseball diamond.|$|E
5|$|FC <b>Bayern</b> {{is ranked}} {{fourth in the}} current UEFA club {{coefficient}} rankings.|$|E
5|$|FC <b>Bayern</b> {{was founded}} in 1900 by 11 {{football}} players, led by Franz John. Although <b>Bayern</b> won its first national championship in 1932, the club was not selected for the Bundesliga at its inception in 1963. The club had its period of greatest success {{in the middle of}} the 1970s when, under the captaincy of Franz Beckenbauer, it won the European Cup three times in a row (1974–1976). Overall, <b>Bayern</b> has reached ten European Cup/UEFA Champions League finals, most recently winning their fifth title in 2013 as part of a continental treble. <b>Bayern</b> has also won one UEFA Cup, one European Cup Winners' Cup, one UEFA Super Cup, one FIFA Club World Cup and two Intercontinental Cups, making it one of the most successful European clubs internationally and the only German club to have won both international titles. Since the formation of the Bundesliga, <b>Bayern</b> has been the dominant club in German football with 27 titles and has won 9 of the last 13 titles. They have traditional local rivalries with 1860 Munich and 1. FC Nürnberg, as well as with Borussia Dortmund since the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|G. Score was 1–1 after 90 {{minutes and}} extra time. <b>Bayern</b> Munich won the penalty {{shoot-out}} 5–4.|$|E
5|$|He is {{predominantly}} a left footed player. During a match he will often drift {{to the left}} wing, with his teammate, {{in the case of}} <b>Bayern</b> Munich, Franck Ribéry, switching over to the right. Another factor in his playing style is his relationship with the right-fullback. At <b>Bayern,</b> this partnership with Philipp Lahm has had benefits for the team's efficiency and chemistry. Robben's defensive work improved when he went to <b>Bayern</b> where he often tracks back and covers for his partner when he pushes forward and becomes a temporary right back.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010–11 season, <b>Bayern</b> were {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} round of the Champions League knockout phase by Inter Milan on the away goals rule and finished third in the Bundesliga. Van Gaal was fired by <b>Bayern</b> in April 2011.|$|E
5|$|In the 2012–13 season, Arsenal fell at {{the last}} 16 stage {{for the third time}} in three years, losing 3–1 to <b>Bayern</b> Munich at home, but {{managing}} to win 2–0 in the return leg, meaning they went out on the away goals rule. They were once again eliminated by <b>Bayern</b> Munich in the 2013–14 season after losing 2–0 at home, and drawing 1–1 away at Munich. They were eliminated by Monaco in Round of 16 in the 2014–15 season on away goals, and by Barcelona 5–1 on aggregate in 2015–16. Arsenal exited {{at the last}} 16 for the seventh consecutive time to <b>Bayern</b> Munich, losing 10–2 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} club constitution, Bayern's colours were named as white and blue, but the club played in white shirts with black shorts until 1905, when <b>Bayern</b> joined MSC. MSC decreed that the footballers {{would have to}} play in red shorts. Also, the younger players were called red shorts, which was meant as an insult. For most of the club's early history, <b>Bayern</b> had primarily worn white and maroon home kits. In 1968–69 season, <b>Bayern</b> changed to red and blue striped shirts, with blue shorts and socks. Between 1969 and 1973, the team wore a home strip of red and white striped shirts with either red or white shorts and red socks. In the 1973–74 season, the team switched to an all white kit featuring single vertical red and blue stripes on the shirt. From 1974 onwards, <b>Bayern</b> have mostly worn an all red home kit, with white trim. <b>Bayern</b> revived the red and blue striped colour scheme between 1995 and 1997. In 1997, blue was the dominant colour {{for the first time}} when Adidas released an all navy blue home kit with a red chest band. In 1999, <b>Bayern</b> returned to a predominantly red kit, which featured blue sleeves, and in 2000 the club released a traditional all red kit with white trim to be worn for Champions League matches. <b>Bayern</b> also wore a Rotwein coloured home kits in Bundesliga matches between 2001 and 2003, and during the 2006–07 Champions League campaign, in reference to their first choice colours prior to the late 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In the quarter-finals, <b>Bayern</b> Munich {{were drawn}} against Group F winners and fellow German side Kaiserslautern, while Manchester United were paired with Group C winners Internazionale. Two Dwight Yorke goals gave United a 2–0 win {{in their first}} leg at Old Trafford, while <b>Bayern</b> beat Kaiserslautern by the same {{scoreline}} at the Olympiastadion through goals from Élber and Effenberg. In the second leg, Nicola Ventola pulled a goal back for Inter, but Paul Scholes secured United's passage to the semi-finals with a late away goal. Meanwhile, <b>Bayern</b> won convincingly at Kaiserslautern, as goals from Effenberg, Carsten Jancker, Mario Basler and an own goal from Uwe Rösler gave them a 4–0 win, 6–0 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{leg of the}} semi-finals of the 2011–12 Champions League, against his former club Real Madrid, which was then managed by José Mourinho (who had been his manager at Chelsea), after <b>Bayern</b> fell behind 2–0, Robben {{converted}} a penalty to level the tie at 3–3. <b>Bayern</b> advanced to the final after winning the resulting penalty shootout.|$|E
5|$|In the semi-finals, Barcelona's opponents were <b>Bayern</b> Munich, {{winners of}} the 2013–14 Bundesliga. They hosted the first leg on 6 May, {{breaking}} the deadlock with two late goals from Messi in a three-minute spell, and an added-time addition by Neymar. Six days later at the Allianz Arena, <b>Bayern</b> took the lead through Medhi Benatia, and Neymar put Barcelona into the lead by half time. Second-half goals by Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Müller gave <b>Bayern</b> a 3–2 win on the night, but Barcelona advanced 5–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half, and within 13 seconds they had scored {{to lead the}} match 3–0. Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher kicked {{the ball into the}} <b>Bayern</b> half, defender Thiam missed his header, which meant the ball dropped to Owen, who {{controlled}} the ball with his right foot and then put the ball into the <b>Bayern</b> goal with his left foot. <b>Bayern</b> reduced the deficit in the 57th minute when Salihamidžić scored. He headed the ball into the Liverpool goal from Bayern's first corner of the match to reduce the deficit to two goals. Midway through the half both teams made substitutions. <b>Bayern</b> replaced Sforza, Claudio Pizarro and Salihamidžić for Niko Kovač, Carsten Jancker and Roque Santa Cruz respectively. Liverpool substituted Gerrard and Riise for Igor Bišćan and Danny Murphy respectively. Liverpool started to pass the ball around their midfield and defence in an attempt to waste time, however in the 82nd minute <b>Bayern</b> scored again. Substitute Jancker headed into the Liverpool goal from a cross by Elber. Immediately afterwards <b>Bayern</b> had an opportunity to equalise, however Lizarazu's shot was straight at Liverpool goalkeeper Sander Westerveld. No further goals were scored and the referee blew for full-time with the final score 3–2 to Liverpool.|$|E
5|$|Matchdays 3 and 4 saw double-headers, with Manchester United {{taking on}} Brøndby and <b>Bayern</b> Munich playing Barcelona. Manchester United beat Brøndby 6–2 {{in their first}} match at Parken Stadium in Copenhagen, then 5–0 at Old Trafford two weeks later. <b>Bayern</b> also {{recorded}} a pair of victories over Barcelona, winning 1–0 at the Olympiastadion and 2–1 at the Camp Nou. On matchday 5, United played their second match against Barcelona – their {{first trip to the}} Camp Nou of the season – and again the two sides played out a 3–3 draw. With <b>Bayern</b> beating Brøndby 2–0 at home, the German side moved onto 10 points and took top spot in the group going into the final round of matches, one point ahead of United. Qualification for the quarter-finals was only guaranteed for the group winners, meaning that both United and <b>Bayern</b> had to play for victory in their final match against each other at Old Trafford. United took the lead just before half-time through a Roy Keane strike from just outside the penalty area; however, Hasan Salihamidžić equalised for <b>Bayern</b> in the 55th minute and the game finished in a 1–1 draw. The result meant that <b>Bayern</b> finished as group winners, but United's points total was enough to see them go through as one of the two group runners-up with the best record.|$|E
5|$|Müller's first Bundesliga goal of {{the season}} came over 2. Bundesliga champions SpVgg Greuther Fürth in Bayern's 3–0 victory on 27 August 2012. On 2 September, he netted a brace as <b>Bayern</b> thrashed {{southern}} rivals VfB Stuttgart, 6–1, in front of 71,000 at the newly expanded Allianz Arena. Müller helped <b>Bayern</b> achieve a record-breaking start to the league season, when he netted a brace over newly promoted Fortuna Düsseldorf on 20 October in their 5–0 victory, recording Bayern's eighth successive win. Three days later, he scored his first Champions League {{goal of the}} season, netting from the penalty spot, as <b>Bayern</b> defeated Lille 1–0 at the French side's newly built Grand Stade Lille Métropole.|$|E
5|$|On 11 January 2008, Jürgen Klinsmann {{was named}} as Hitzfeld's successor, taking charge on 1 July 2008 after signing a two-year contract. <b>Bayern</b> Munich lost the DFL-Supercup 1–2 against Borussia Dortmund in 2008 then was {{eliminated}} by Bayer Leverkusen in the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal. In the Champions League <b>Bayern</b> also reached the quarter-finals after winning Group F and defeating Sporting CP {{in the first}} knockout round, achieving a Champions League record aggregate of 12–1. On 27 April, two days after a home defeat against Schalke 04 which saw <b>Bayern</b> drop to the third place in the table, Klinsmann was fired. Former trainer Jupp Heynckes was named as caretaker {{until the end of}} the season. <b>Bayern</b> eventually finished second, thus qualifying directly for the Champions League in 2009–10.|$|E
5|$|On 12 March 2016, Müller {{scored a}} brace in a 5–0 victory over Werder Bremen. Four days later, with <b>Bayern</b> {{trailing}} Juventus 1–2 {{in the second}} leg of the Champions League round of 16, he scored a 91st-minute equaliser before <b>Bayern</b> won in extra time 4–2 (6–4 aggregate).|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 2010, Robben sent <b>Bayern</b> {{into the}} semi-finals of the Champions League with a {{stunning}} volley against Manchester United {{from the edge}} of the area into the corner of the net. The game ended 3–2 to United (4–4 on aggregate), with <b>Bayern</b> advancing again due to away goals.|$|E
