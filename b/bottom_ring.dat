The objective of this study was to evaluate cotton cultivars sensitivity to soil compaction. Soil columns were built with three pvc rings with internal diameter of 10 cm and filled with an alfisol. The heights of the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>rings</b> were 15 cm, and the intermediate ring, in which the soil was compacted, was 3. 5 cm high. The levels of compression used in the subsurface were characterized by penetration resistances of 0. 41, 0. 93, 1. 41 and 1. 92 MPa. The cultivars 701 FMT, FMT 705, FMT 707, FMX 951 LL and FMX 966 LL were grown up to 23 days after plant emergence, when the dry matter of shoots and roots, root length density and root diameter were determined. The cotton cultivars have variability in their sensitivity to resistance to penetration. The cultivar 707 FMT is more sensitive to soil compaction, while the FMT 701 is more tolerant. Penetration resistance of around 0. 92 to 1. 06 MPa reduce 50 % cotton root growth, but resistance to penetration of 1. 92 MPa did not totally prevent growth...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanism}} of randomization in late boundary layer transition {{is a key}} issue of late boundary layer transition and turbulence theory. We studied the mechanism carefully by high order DNS. The randomization was originally considered {{as a result of}} large background noise and non-periodic spanwise boundary conditions. It was addressed that the large ring structure is affected by background noises first and then the change of large ring structure affects the small length scale quickly, which directly leads to randomization and formation of turbulence. However, what we observed is that the loss of symmetry starts from the middle level rings while the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>rings</b> are still symmetric. The nonsymmetric structure of second level rings will influence the small length scales at the boundary layer bottom quickly. The symmetry loss {{at the bottom of the}} boundary layer is quickly spread to up level through ejections. This will lead to randomization of the whole flow field. Therefore, the internal instability of multiple level ring structure, especially the middle ring cycles, is the main reason for flow randomization, but not the background noise. A hypothesis is given that the loss of symmetry may be caused by the shift from C-type transition to K-type transition or reverses. Comment: 50 th AIAA Aerospace Sciences Meetin...|$|R

50|$|While it {{is quite}} well known on campus, the Iron Ring Clock is not always {{recognized}} as a clock. The most common criticism of the clock {{is that it is}} counterintuitive to read. (It must be read straight on, with the number on the top ring denoting the hour and the number on the <b>bottom</b> <b>ring</b> denoting the minute. If there is no number directly under the hour indicator, the minute must be inferred from the nearest two numbers.) As the rings move slowly, the clock has been mistaken for a static display. It has shown the wrong time in the past, due to events such as power outages or breakdowns; in 2006/2007, the clock stopped for three months due to motor bearing failure. In 2007, an uninterruptible power supply was installed to eliminate the problem with power outages. However, in the absence of such events the motor and mechanism have shown themselves to be quite accurate.|$|E
50|$|The next {{breakthrough}} in rapid tuning came around 1815 when Johann Stumpff, a musician and inventor from Amsterdam invented {{a way for}} a drum's pitch to be changed by physically rotating the instrument. Similar to Cramer's design, rods attached the counter hoop to a metal ring below the bowl. Unlike Cramer's design, Stumpff added a second metal ring that {{was attached to the}} legs supporting the kettle. The <b>bottom</b> <b>ring</b> was threaded and a long bolt extended {{from the base of the}} drum up through the threaded ring and attached to the second ring. As the bowl and counter hoop rotated, the counter hoop would move up and down but the bowl would remain stationary. This allowed for different levels of tension to be placed on the counter hoop and, as a result, produced different pitches. This invention was popular because it was cheap to manufacture, worked well, and was easy to transport, which made these drums ideal for traveling orchestras. However, the fact that players had to put down the mallets before rotating the drums was a major drawback.|$|E

40|$|TIP 48 and TIP 49 are {{two related}} and highly conserved {{eukaryotic}} AAA+ proteins with an essential biological function and {{a critical role}} in major pathways that are closely linked to cancer. They are found together as components of several highly conserved chromatin-modifying complexes. Both proteins show sequence homology to bacterial RuvB but the nature and mechanism of their biochemical role remain unknown. Recombinant human TIP 48 and TIP 49 were assembled into a stable high molecular mass equimolar complex and tested for activity in vitro. TIP 48 /TIP 49 complex formation resulted in synergistic increase in ATPase activity but ATP hydrolysis was not stimulated in the presence of single-stranded, double-stranded or four-way junction DNA and no DNA helicase or branch migration activity could be detected. Complexes with catalytic defects in either TIP 48 or TIP 49 had no ATPase activity showing that both proteins within the TIP 48 /TIP 49 complex are required for ATP hydrolysis. The structure of the TIP 48 /TIP 49 complex was examined by negative stain electron microscopy. Three-dimensional reconstruction at 20 Å resolution revealed that the TIP 48 /TIP 49 complex consisted of two stacked hexameric rings with C 6 symmetry. The top and <b>bottom</b> <b>rings</b> showed substantial structural differences. Interestingly, TIP 48 formed oligomers in the presence of adenine nucleotides, whilst TIP 49 did not. The results point to biochemical differences between TIP 48 and TIP 49, which may explain the structural differences between the two hexameric rings and could be significant for specialised functions that the proteins perform individually...|$|R
