5|$|The {{budget for}} the film's costumes was US$1,600, {{far more than the}} stage {{production}} budget, <b>but</b> <b>having</b> to double up on costumes for filming was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magenta's maid's uniform.|$|E
5|$|At 15:05 another British ship {{appeared}} on the horizon, the sloop , which persuaded Montfort that {{he could no longer}} protect the battered Pomone against superior numbers. Pauline set all sail to the west, away from her opponents who were either too battered or too distant to pursue. Alceste and Active now concentrated their full broadsides on Pomone, which soon lost both masts and was forced to surrender to prevent total destruction. Pauline escaped, later reaching Ancona safely <b>but</b> <b>having</b> suffered severe damage in the engagement.|$|E

5|$|Combined Emergency Service – {{these are}} full service {{emergency}} service agencies, {{which may be}} found in places such as airports or large colleges and universities.

They {{may be found in}} smaller towns and cities, where size or budget does not warrant separate services. This multi-functionality allows {{to make the most of}} limited resource or budget, <b>but</b> <b>having</b> a single team respond to any emergency.|$|E
5|$|Current {{official}} transit {{maps of the}} New York City Subway {{are based}} on a 1979 design by Michael Hertz Associates. The maps are not geographically accurate due to the complexity of the system (i.e. Manhattan being the smallest borough, <b>but</b> <b>having</b> the most services), but they do show major city streets as an aid to navigation. The newest edition took effect on June 27, 2010, and makes Manhattan bigger and Staten Island smaller. Earlier diagrams of the subway (the first being produced in 1958), while being more aesthetically pleasing, had the perception of being more geographically inaccurate than the diagrams today. The design of the subway map by Massimo Vignelli, published by the MTA between 1972 and 1979, has become a modern classic but the MTA deemed the map flawed due to its placement of geographical elements.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{another study}} was {{published}} describing the integument and dermis of Psittacosaurus sp., {{from two different}} specimens. The skin remains could be observed by a natural cross-section to compare them to modern animals, showing that dinosaurian dermal layers evolved in parallel to those in many other large vertebrates. The collagen tissue fibres in Psittacosaurus are complex, virtually identical to all other vertebrates in structure <b>but</b> <b>having</b> an exceptional thickness of about forty layers. As the sections of dermis were collected from the abdomen, where the scales were eroded, the tissue may have assisted with the musculature of the stomach and intestines and offered protection against predators.|$|E
