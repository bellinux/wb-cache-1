5000|$|The {{band was}} formed in 1980 by Mike McGuire (vocals) and Steve Rolls (Guitar) after {{disbanding}} 1st generation punk band The Now. They recruited Pete Jostins (Bass), Shaun Foreman (Guitar & Keyboards) and Colin Meech (Drums), with various others contributing in their early days. They were initially influenced by bands such as A Certain Ratio and Shriekback. Their first releases were two self-financed singles, [...] "Janes Third Party" [...] and the To You, With Regard EP, in 1980 and 1981 respectively. The latter was sufficiently successful to attract major-label interest from CBS and Virgin Records, but after a further single (Traffic Tax Scheme) on their own Chant label, and with guitarist Simon Childs added as a permanent member, they signed a deal with Warners subsidiary Blanco y Negro, debuting on the label in 1986 with eight versions of the single [...] "Sing Song". After releasing the Spacemate package - a double LP, book, poster, set of cards and instruction manual, packaged together in a soap <b>box</b> <b>container</b> and designed by Jon Wozencroft, the band moved on to indie label Rough Trade Records, where they would stay {{for the rest of}} their career. Their fondness for short songs was evident on their first Rough Trade release, a 7-inch EP featuring eight, 1 minute songs and titled [...] "Autumn Cut Back Job Lot Offer", released in early 1987. The following year, they released their second album, 76 Kids Forever, which they described as a [...] "soap opera musical". The band continued for one final effort, 1990s Ko-Opera album, before splitting up with an unreleased album (minus Simon Childs) in the can.|$|E

The idea of a container without an aesthetic claim allowed Le Corbusier to think only about the show; in the meantime he entrusted Xenakis with a "mathematical translation" of his sketches, which represented the volume of a rounded bottle with a stomach-shaped plan. In the Poème Électronic the correspondence between music and architecture is not only a matter of geometry. It was projected by Le Corbusier as if it were an orchestral work in which lights, loudspeakers, film projections on curved surfaces, spectators' shadows and their expression of wonder, objects hanging from the ceiling and the containing space itself were all virtual instruments. Architecture played, at the same time, the role of orchestral instrument and of sound <b>box,</b> <b>container</b> and contents...|$|E
40|$|Ships {{are both}} the glue and grease {{of the global}} economy. The {{merchant}} vessel of the late twentieth-century and early twenty first-century, combined with the technology of the big <b>box</b> <b>container,</b> is {{the means by which}} most commodities move around the world—although its central role and those of maritime spaces are all too often overlooked (Levinson, 2006; Sekula 2001). But ships themselves are also commodities and they too change value and move through value regimes. In the case of their commercial life, which is likely to be 25 – 32 years including periodic refits, ships progressively downgrade in terms of profitability and value. This chapter charts the passage of such vessels. We look at how these enduring and mobile objects that, in life, link topographically distant ports into trading networks carrying commodities, cross into different networks of disposal and reuse, at the death. At this moment they are linked to different locations such as breaking yards, where they become mutable and are broken apart. These breaking locations enable them to be reborn as new commodities in different networks of value. As in Thompson’s (1979) formulation, the category of waste is a fulcrum point, where one form of value dies, yet another can be born. Here, we show how disparate networks are linked through processes of material destruction and transformation enabling the rebirth of value...|$|E

40|$|The octopus example. Our {{constrained}} partitioning optimization system automatically {{generates the}} partitioning of this octopus model, which contains nine pieces {{as shown in}} (a) and (c). These nine pieces can be packed into a <b>box</b> <b>container</b> as shown in (b) and (d), which occupies only 10. 4 percent of its original container volume. As the 3 D printing technology starts to revolutionize our daily life and the manufacturing industries, a critical problem is about to e-merge: how can we find an automatic way to divide a 3 D model into multiple printable pieces, so as to save the space, to reduce the printing time, or to make a large model printable by small printers. In this paper, we present a systematic study on the partitioning and packing of 3 D models under the multi-phase level set framework. We first construct analysis tools to evaluate the qualities of a parti-tioning using six metrics: stress load, surface details, interface area, packed size, printability, and assembling. Based on this analysis, we then formulate level set methods to improve the qualities of the partitioning according to the metrics. These methods are integrated into an automatic system, which repetitively and locally optimizes the partitioning. Given the optimized partitioning result, we further provide a container structure modeling algorithm to facilitate the packing process of the printed pieces. Our experiment shows that the system can generate quality partitioning of various 3 D models for space saving and fast production purposes...|$|E
40|$|In situ {{measurement}} of soil water {{content is of}} fundamental importance in vadose zone processes. While time domain reflectometry (TDR) is a universally accepted technique, having been developed since the 1980 s, water content reflectometer (WCR) is still a relatively new technique and does not hold a similar background. The main goal {{of this study was}} to establish an accurate calibration curve for WCR sensors to be installed in an artificial hillslope designed to study the triggering of shallow landslides. Therefore, high accuracy calibration at the high end of the water content range and for large soil volumes was necessary. An experimental device was specifically designed to provide a calibration procedure for a soil control volume commensurate with the application scale of the probes in the hillslope. A large <b>box</b> <b>container</b> (60 by 50 by 60 cm) was used, inside which three WCR probes and three tensiometers were arranged. A drip emitter produced assigned flow rates, while a load cell at the base measured the time evolution of the infiltrated water mass. Water content was evaluated at approximately steady-state flow conditions for infiltration and drainage experiments, performed with varying degrees of compaction to detect the effect of the porosity on the calibration curve. The experimental results suggest a calibration relationship linearly depending not only on the WCR output signal but also on the porosity. In addition, the calibration curve provided by the manufacturer significantly underestimates the soil water content, with a range of predicted volumetric water content values between 3 and 35 %, compared with actual values varying between 19 and 61 %...|$|E
40|$|Problems {{of quality}} {{maintenance}} are {{encountered in the}} marine transport from tropical and sub-tropical to temperate climatic zones, of hygroscopic durable foods such as cocoa beans and similar commodities, particularly in winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Cargoes frequently display damaging mould formation and insect infestation on unloading. This publication indicates {{the likelihood of the}} incidence of these problems for different modes of transport by ship (bulk, bag and <b>box</b> <b>container).</b> Interpretations are based upon the principles of heat and moisture transfer and experimental observations of several shipments. The mould problem is usually interpreted as arising from the migration of moisture from the interior of the cargo to its sides. It occurs when a temperature difference develops between the cargo interior and the frame of the ship's hold. With bulk commodities, the moisture problem can occur at the sides of the cargo if this is in direct contact with the sides of the ship. With bagged commodities, similar difficulties can arise, but they are less pronounced because of the beneficial effect of air circulation around the bags, particularly if dunnage is present. For box-container transport, the major risk of quality deterioration occurs in winter following offloading on the dockside. Dew can rapidly form {{on the underside of the}} container roof, and 'internal raining' with subsequent wetting and mould formation can occur with the associated risk of mycotoxin production. Closed box containers present the greatest hazard. Naturally ventilated and open-sided containers together with suitable modifications to handling practices are considered to be more suitable for the avoidance of this problem. General recommendations for good practice are also included in the text...|$|E
