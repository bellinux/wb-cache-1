Despite this, Lois decides to go to Dr. Hartman to have the in vitro fertilization performed, enduring more of Dr. Hartman's shtick involving celebrity crossbreeds and having a tribe of bush men implant the egg with blowguns. A pregnancy test comes back positive the next day, and a furious Peter attempts to cause Lois to have a miscarriage before ultimately confronting her about the pregnancy. While she continues asserting her intention to provide a child to Naomi and Dale, Quahog 5 News suddenly reveals that Naomi and Dale died in a car crash on Interstate 95.

The soap also tackled the issue of mental illness and carers of people who have mental conditions, illustrated with mother and daughter Jean and Stacey Slater; Jean suffers from bipolar disorder, and teenage daughter Stacey was her carer (this storyline won a Mental Health Media Award in September 2006). Stacey went on to struggle with the disorder herself. The issue of illiteracy was highlighted by the characters of middle-aged Keith and his young son Darren.

500|$|Sandra Eleanor Rivett {{was born}} on 16September 1945, the third child of Albert and Eunice Hensby. The family moved to Australia when she was two years old, but {{returned}} in 1955. Sandra was a popular child, described at school as [...] "intelligent, although she does not excel academically". She worked for six months as an apprentice hairdresser before taking {{a job as a}} secretary in Croydon. Following a failed romance she became a voluntary patient at a mental hospital near Redhill, Surrey, where she was treated for depression. She became engaged to a builder named John and {{took a job as a}} children's nanny for a doctor in Croydon. On 13March 1964, she gave birth to a boy named Stephen, but, as her relationship with John was failing, she returned home to live with her parents and considered giving the <b>baby</b> <b>up</b> for adoption. Her parents took on the responsibility and adopted him in May 1965. Sandra later worked at an old people's home, before moving to Portsmouth to stay with her elder sister. While there she met Roger Rivett; the two married on 10June 1967 in Croydon. Roger was serving as a Royal Navy able seaman and later worked as a loader for British Road Services, while Sandra worked part-time at Reedham Orphanage in Purley. In summer 1973 he took a job on an Esso tanker, returning to their flat in Kenley a few months later by which time Sandra was employed by a cigarette company in Croydon. Their marriage collapsed in May 1974 when, suspicious of Sandra's movements while he was away, Roger went to live with his parents. She was by then listed on the books of a Belgravia domestic agency and had been caring for an elderly couple in that district. A few weeks later she began to work for the Lucans.|$|E
500|$|Herbert [...] "Herb" [...] Powell (voiced by Danny DeVito), is Homer's {{paternal}} half-brother. He resembles Homer, {{though he}} is much thinner, boasts {{a full head of}} hair and is more astute. He first appeared in the season two episode [...] "Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?" [...] when Homer discovered he had a half-brother, the product of a short-lived affair between his father Abe and a carnival dunk-tank worker who was also a prostitute (identified in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album as [...] "Gaby"). [...] A year after putting the <b>baby</b> <b>up</b> for adoption, Abe married Mona, who insisted he promise never to tell Homer about Herb or how he was conceived. [...] Herb was raised by his adoptive parents Edward and [...] Mililani Powell (first names given in The Simpsons Uncensored Family Album), put himself through college by working odd jobs, then founded Powell Motors, a car company based in Detroit. Herb is an exception to [...] "the Simpson Gene", which causes all male members of the Simpson family to gradually lose their intelligence as they mature, as Herb is intelligent, successful and an astute businessman, becoming extremely wealthy due to his car dealership. Overjoyed to learn that he had a blood family, Herb bonded with the children and hired Homer, as a representative of average Americans, to design a car. The car was a flop, bankrupting the company, and Herb angrily rejects Homer as a brother and became a street vagrant. The episode was written by Jeff Martin but the idea of having Herb voiced by Danny DeVito had been pitched by Sam Simon. Some were upset with the sad ending of the episode, and as a result the producers decided to make a sequel. Herb re-appeared the next season in [...] "Brother, Can You Spare Two Dimes?". Now broke and homeless, he briefly settled in the Simpson household, despite his intense continuing antipathy toward Homer. Homer loaned Herb $2000, which Herb used to build an invention that translated infantile speech into comprehensible English, based on observations he made of Maggie. He proceeded to mass-produce his new product and regained his fortune. In gratitude, he bought gifts for each member of the family and paid Homer back with his forgiveness. Homer's [...] "seldom seen half-brother" [...] has had only one brief speaking part since this episode: DeVito reprised his role for the Season 24 episode [...] "The Changing of the Guardian", in which Powell's answering machine message, [...] "Hi, you've reached Herb Powell. I'm poor again.", is heard.|$|E

[...] Walter Isaacson, Steve Jobs' {{official}} biographer additionally states that Schieble's father [...] "threatened to cut Joanne off completely" [...] if she continued the relationship. Regardless, while Jandali and Schieble were still unmarried students at the University of Wisconsin in 1954, she became pregnant after spending the summer with him and his family in Homs, Syria. Given her parents' resistance to the relationship, Schieble decided to give the <b>baby</b> <b>up</b> for adoption. She traveled alone to San Francisco to work with a doctor who cared for unwed mothers and gave birth to a baby boy in 1955 (who was eventually adopted by a couple in San Francisco). He would grow up to be Apple Inc. co-founder, Steve Jobs. Six months after giving the <b>baby</b> <b>up</b> for adoption, Schieble's father died. She then wed Jandali and gave birth to Mona.|$|E

2500|$|McTavish {{was also}} {{instrumental}} {{in a major}} but still popular retroactive continuity (retcon) storyline in 1993. Shortly after being introduced, the audience soon learns Kendall Hart (Sarah Michelle Gellar) is actually Erica's long-lost daughter. Kendall was conceived after Erica was raped on her 14th birthday by her father's actor friend Richard Fields. After she became pregnant, Erica gave her <b>baby</b> <b>up</b> for adoption to the Harts, a couple from Florida. Kendall comes to Pine Valley after finding out her birth mother is the famous Erica Kane. Kendall longs for Erica's approval but is also angry over her perceived feelings of being 'abandoned' at birth and comes to want payback against her mother. Though {{they try to make}} their family work at first, Kendall acts out [...] and mother and daughter experience a painful, strained, and complicated relationship during this time in the series. The popular Gellar was proclaimed by some [...] "as the second coming of Erica" [...] in her two years as Kendall Hart from 1993–1995 but left the show to pursue other acting opportunities. Producers ended up waiting at least six years before even contemplating to recast the role (which eventually went to Alicia Minshew in 2002).|$|E
2500|$|Jobs's {{biological}} mother Schieble became pregnant {{with him in}} 1954 when she and Jandali spent the summer {{with his family in}} Homs, Syria. Jandali has stated that he [...] "was very much in love with Joanne ... but sadly, her father was a tyrant, and forbade her to marry me, as I was from Syria. And so she told me she wanted to give the <b>baby</b> <b>up</b> for adoption." [...] Jobs told his official biographer that Schieble's father was dying at the time, Schieble did not want to aggravate him, and both felt that at 23 they were too young to marry. In addition, as there was a strong stigma against bearing a child out of wedlock and raising it as a single mother, and as abortions were illegal and dangerous, adoption was the only option women had in the United States in 1954. According to Jandali, Schieble deliberately did not involve him in the process: [...] "without telling me, Joanne upped and left to move to San Francisco to have the baby without anyone knowing, including me ... {{she did not want to}} bring shame onto the family and thought this was the best for everyone." [...] Schieble put herself in the care of a [...] "doctor who sheltered unwed mothers, delivered their babies, and quietly arranged closed adoptions." ...|$|E

Campbell is unaware of her pregnancy until the end of Season 2, when Peggy tells him that she gave the <b>baby</b> <b>up</b> for adoption.
