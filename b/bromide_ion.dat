5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported by only limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple <b>bromide</b> <b>ion</b> (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E
5|$|Elemental bromine is very {{reactive}} {{and thus}} {{does not occur}} free in nature, but in colourless soluble crystalline mineral halide salts, analogous to table salt. While it is rather rare in the Earth's crust, the high solubility of the <b>bromide</b> <b>ion</b> (Br−) has caused its accumulation in the oceans. Commercially the element is easily extracted from brine pools, mostly in the United States, Israel and China. The mass of bromine in the oceans is about one three-hundredth of that of chlorine.|$|E
5|$|Bromine is {{the third}} halogen, being a nonmetal in group 17 of the {{periodic}} table. Its properties are thus {{similar to those of}} fluorine, chlorine, and iodine, and tend to be intermediate between those of the two neighbouring halogens, chlorine and iodine. Bromine has the electron configuration 3d104s24p5, with the seven electrons in the fourth and outermost shell acting as its valence electrons. Like all halogens, it is thus one electron short of a full octet, and is hence a strong oxidising agent, reacting with many elements in order to complete its outer shell. Corresponding to periodic trends, it is intermediate in electronegativity between chlorine and iodine (F: 3.98, Cl: 3.16, Br: 2.96, I: 2.66), and is less reactive than chlorine and more reactive than iodine. It is also a weaker oxidising agent than chlorine, but a stronger one than iodine. Conversely, the <b>bromide</b> <b>ion</b> is a weaker reducing agent than iodide, but a stronger one than chloride. These similarities led to chlorine, bromine, and iodine together being classified as one of the original triads of Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner, whose work foreshadowed the periodic law for chemical elements. It is intermediate in atomic radius between chlorine and iodine, and this leads to many of its atomic properties being similarly intermediate in value between chlorine and iodine, such as first ionisation energy, electron affinity, enthalpy of dissociation of the X2 molecule (X = Cl, Br, I), ionic radius, and X–X bond length. The volatility of bromine accentuates its very penetrating, choking, and unpleasant odour.|$|E

2500|$|Rather than {{creating}} a molecule with the halogen substituted with something else, one can completely eliminate both the halogen and a nearby hydrogen, thus forming an alkene by dehydrohalogenation.

40|$|In this work, {{the effects}} of bromide on the {{chlorination}} of NF 90 polyamide membranes have been investigated by a comparison between chlorination with and without <b>bromide</b> <b>ions.</b> The experimental results showed that chlorination {{in the presence of}} <b>bromide</b> <b>ions</b> (from 1 to 200 ppm Br-) makes the membrane simultaneously chlorinated and brominated. Increasing bromide concentration enhanced bromine uptake of the membrane, and shifted the halogenated form of the membrane from chlorinated to mixed and then to fully brominated. Chlorination under the condition of 100 ppm-hr Cl- 2 increased the ratio of bromine to chlorine content from 0. 13 at 1 ppm bromide concentration to 252 at 100 ppm bromide concentration. The bromine, oxidized from <b>bromide</b> <b>ions</b> by the addition of chlorine, outcompeted the chlorine during chlorination. Furthermore, chlorination of the membrane with 100 ppm <b>bromide</b> <b>ions</b> caused more bromination than chlorination with 100 ppm bromine did. Once the chlorine bound to the membrane, the chlorine could not oxidize bromide to bromine. The flux decline of membranes exposed to chlorine with bromide was greater than that of membranes chlorinated without bromide, especially at lower pH. Chlorination of NF 90 polyamide membranes with bromide can cause more severe degradation of the membranes. close 7...|$|R

40|$|Bismuth film {{electrodes}} (BiFEs) prepared ex-situ {{with and}} without complexing <b>bromide</b> <b>ions</b> in the modification solution were investigated using scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM). A feedback mode of the SECM {{was employed to examine}} the conductivity and reactivity of a series of thin bismuth films deposited onto disk glassy carbon substrate electrodes (GCEs) of 3 mm in diameter. A platinum micro-electrode ( = 25 m) was used as the SECM tip, and current against tip/substrate distance was recorded in solutions containing either Ru(NH 3) 63 + or Fe(CN) 64 - species as redox mediators. With both redox mediators positive feedback approach curves were recorded, which indicated that the bismuth film deposition protocol associated with the addition of <b>bromide</b> <b>ions</b> in the modification solution did not compromise the conductivity of the bismuth film in comparison with that prepared without bromide. However, at the former Bi film a slight kinetic hindering was observed in recycling Ru(NH 3) 63 +, suggesting a different surface potential.
