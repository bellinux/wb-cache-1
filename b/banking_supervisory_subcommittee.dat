40|$|Recently, several {{central banks}} {{have lost their}} <b>bank</b> <b>{{supervisory}}</b> responsibilities, {{in part because it}} has not been shown that supervisory authority improves the conduct of monetary policy. This paper finds that confidential <b>bank</b> <b>supervisory</b> information could help the Board staff more accurately forecast important macroeconomic variables and is used by FOMC members to guide monetary policy. These findings suggest that the complementarity between supervisory responsibilities and monetary policy should be an important consideration when evaluating the structure of the central bank. © 2000 the President and Fellows of Harvard College and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology...|$|R

The thesis provides a broader perspective of the housing market so that the first part {{is devoted to the}} liquidity surplus as it is closely connected with the housing market. The next part of the thesis focuses on housing price bubbles and subsequent bursts as well as the tools of the central <b>bank</b> (<b>supervisory</b> authority) to mitigate such risks. It is discussed whether using monetary policy to affect house prices that do not reflect fundamentals is advisable. Macroprudential policy with its tools is introduced as an alternative.

40|$|The paper''s {{central theme}} {{is that where}} a {{financial}} crisis emerges, regional supervisors should have systems in place to effectively respond to their country-specific crises and-in the case of foreign operations and financial conglomerates-to collaborate comprehensively with other supervisory agencies and respective ministries to avert a regional crisis or address the immediate crisis at hand. For financial institutions to expand across borders without undermining regional and global financial stability, supervisory agencies must develop the capacity to collaboratively and collectively handle crises.

50|$|The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) is a {{committee}} of <b>banking</b> <b>supervisory</b> authorities that was established by the central bank governors of the Group of Ten countries in 1974. It provides a forum for regular cooperation on <b>banking</b> <b>supervisory</b> matters. Its objective is to enhance understanding of key supervisory issues and {{improve the quality of}} banking supervision worldwide. The Committee frames guidelines and standards in different areas - some of the better known among them are the international standards on capital adequacy, the Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision and the Concordat on cross-border banking supervision. The Committee's Secretariat is located at the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) in Basel, Switzerland. However, the BIS and the Basel Committee remain two distinct entities.|$|R
40|$|Formulating {{international}} standards on banking supervision {{is one of}} the most important topics of international financial law. The recent international financial crisis is another striking example on the significance and relevance of this subject. This thesis attempts to evaluate the impact of {{international standards}} of banking supervision aimed at the creation of a "safe and sound" banking system on Jordanian legislation at two levels: to what extent international standards set out by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision ("BCBS") have influenced Jordanian law; and how these standards can assist in improving the Jordanian law as well as direct new policy reforms. The first finding of the thesis is that Jordanian law is significantly compliant with international standards. The second main finding is that soft law, as opposed to hard law, is the optimal form of setting international <b>banking</b> <b>supervisory</b> standards. The thesis also finds that the BCBS standards do not provide adequate guidance on the structure of the <b>banking</b> <b>supervisory</b> authority. The thesis concludes with recommendations on how to enhance international <b>banking</b> <b>supervisory</b> standards as well as the structure and substantive law of banking supervision in Jordan in light of international standards and with occasional reference to the UK Law.

40|$|The {{increased}} {{presence of}} foreign banks in a country''s domestic banking system necessitates {{the development of}} effective cross-border prudential supervision where the consolidated supervision is the essential element. This paper presents foreign bank supervision in terms of division of responsibilities between the home and host countries, consolidated supervision, quality of home-country supervision, memoranda of understanding (MOUs), and "ringfencing" of banks. A number of challenges which foreign banks bring to emerging market banking supervisors are also discussed. The paper also provides surveys of country cases.

40|$|Which {{commercial}} <b>bank</b> <b>supervisory</b> policies ease - or intensify - {{the degree}} to which bank corruption is an obstacle to firms raising external finance? Based on new data from more than 2, 500 firms across 37 countries, this paper provides the first empirical assessment of the impact of different <b>bank</b> <b>supervisory</b> policies on firms%u 2019 financing obstacles. We find that the traditional approach to bank supervision, which involves empowering official supervisory agencies to directly monitor, discipline, and influence banks, does not improve the integrity of bank lending. Rather, we find that a supervisory strategy that focuses on empowering private monitoring of banks by forcing banks to disclose accurate information to the private sector tends to lower {{the degree to}} which corruption of bank officials is an obstacle to firms raising external finance. In extensions, we find that regulations that empower private monitoring exert a particularly beneficial effect on the integrity of bank lending in countries with sound legal institutions. ...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (l. 71 - 72). The {{phenomenon of}} bank failures and {{the instability of}} Lebanon's banking sector were the two main issues behind this Study. The causes that led to bank trouble can be grouped under three categories: external, as function {{of war and the}} consequent socio-economic problems; internally, because of bad management and weak systems of internal controls; and supervisory -auditing defects. An objective analysis was conducted of the Lebanese <b>Banking</b> <b>supervisory</b> system, and the rules and regulations currently in force. On the other hand, a comparative study was made with some of the EEC countries, in relation to the <b>banking</b> <b>supervisory</b> systems and the relationship between the supervisory authorities, the external auditors, and the client banks. However, emphasis was made on external auditing in Lebanon in relation to that of the United Kingdom and Switzerland. Pressures for regulation of banks grew as people realized the danger of bank failures. Bank supervision is, required to promote safe and sound banking systems and to prevent unsound or speculative loans and investments. 1 bound copy: 77, [21] leaves available at RNL...|$|R
40|$|Recent standard-setting {{activity}} {{related to}} fair value accounting has injected {{new life into}} questions of whether fair value provides information useful for decision-making, and whether there might be unintended consequences on financial stability. This discussion paper provides insight into these questions by performing a holistic evaluation of fair value accounting’s usefulness, the potential impacts it may have on financial institutions and any broader macroeconomic effects. Materials reviewed {{as part of this}} analysis include public bank regulatory filings, financial statements, and fair value research. The <b>bank</b> <b>supervisory</b> rating approach referred to as CAMELS is used as an organizing principle for the paper. CAMELS serves as a convenient way to both categorize potential impacts of fair value on financial institutions, as well as provide a <b>bank</b> <b>supervisory</b> perspective alongside the more traditional investor’s views on decision usefulness. The overall conclusion based on the evidence presented is that implementing fair value accounting more broadly may not necessarily provide financial statement users with more transparent and useful reporting. Additionally, financial stability may be negatively impacted by fair value accounting due to the interconnectedness of financial institutions...|$|R
