2500|$|During summer 1924, Wood {{frequently}} corresponded and {{met with}} Du Bois and others critical of McKenzie's administration to address their grievances with Fisk and explore amicable solutions. In late 1924, McKenzie sensed <b>board</b> <b>support</b> waning for his administration and privately acknowledged his ability to govern Fisk was permanently impaired. The student boycott had sapped energy from the campus not to mention tuition revenue from striking students, and all indications suggested it would continue until McKenzie resigned. According to figures provided by the Dean James Graham, who opposed many of McKenzie's policies, [...] 217 of Fisk's 387 students withdrew {{as part of the}} boycott.|$|E

[...] Media Services includes classroom technical support, Smart <b>Board</b> <b>support,</b> basic video duplication, and equipment for classroom projects.|$|E
2500|$|Preconceptions {{about what}} is an ‘Australian film’ contributed to the {{difficulty}} in finding funding. As an action film, Gabriel [...] "defied the norm and went way outside convention." [...] Producer Kristy Vernon states that [...] "many Australia movies have been either driven by artistic or personal motivations or, have focused on cultural imperatives leading to ‘uncommercial’ movies being produced. These types of movies are unlikely to give off a reasonable return to investors. The consequence {{of this is that}} the Australian finance and investment sectors have been reluctant to support the funding of the movie industry." [...] Abbess is critical of contemporary Australian films, joking that audiences [...] "fall asleep" [...] through them. He also believes there is a mentality in the Australian film industry to wait for government funding, rather than to earn and finance your own films. Everyone he spoke to about getting the film made said that, [...] "even with a big, huge budget, you’re not going to get this made out here." [...] However, after he got one or two people on <b>board</b> <b>support</b> increased in a snowball effect.|$|E
