5000|$|For claimants {{not on a}} [...] "passported benefit", {{the concept}} of a <b>benefit</b> <b>week</b> is {{particularly}} important as benefit will only be paid from the start of a tenancy if the form is requested on the same <b>benefit</b> <b>week</b> as moving in. In all other cases for tenants not on a passported benefit, Housing Benefit will start only from the Monday after the form was requested. If the form is returned within a month of request, otherwise benefit is payable from the Monday after the council receives it.|$|E
50|$|The {{payment of}} the benefit is centred {{on the concept of}} a <b>benefit</b> <b>week,</b> which is a seven-day period running from a Monday to a Sunday. Housing Benefit may be paid on a weekly, fortnightly, lunar monthly or {{calendar}} monthly basis. Housing Benefit paid to landlords is usually paid four weeks in arrears. Regulations require local authorities {{to take into account the}} needs of the claimant when deciding on the frequency of benefit payments, however due to the complexity of calculating a calendar monthly payment and especially any overpayments that arise, most local authorities pay benefit fortnightly to claimants and four weekly to landlords.|$|E

30|$|The three {{replications}} {{had similar}} sample sizes to the Illinois experiment, but {{the manner in}} which sample sizes were determined varied across the states, according to Corson and Spiegelman (2001 b). In Illinois, sample size was determined by estimating how many participants could be enrolled to exhaust the $ 750, 000 the state had available for the bonus pool. In Washington, the sample size was set using the results of the Illinois experiment to determine the sample size needed to produce statistically significant estimates of the reduction in <b>benefit</b> <b>weeks</b> for each treatment cell if the true effect were the same as in Illinois (1.15  weeks). The Pennsylvania budget was based on the budget developed for Washington.|$|R
30|$|As noted previously, the {{reduction}} <b>weeks</b> of <b>benefits</b> received was 1.15  weeks {{in the original}} Illinois experiment. As is often the case, impacts were not as impressive in the replication studies. In New Jersey, <b>benefit</b> <b>weeks</b> were reduced by 0.9  weeks for the bonus plus job search assistance, but Meyer (1995) points out that {{the reduction}} for job search alone was 0.5  weeks, so the marginal impact of the bonus was 0.4  weeks. In Pennsylvania and Washington, most of bonus treatments had modest impacts that were generally not statistically significant, but Meyer (1995) shows in his summary that in both states the treatment that included a high bonus and a long qualification period had a fairly large and statistically significant negative impact on duration, 0.9  weeks in Pennsylvania and 0.7  weeks in Washington.|$|R

30|$|The {{weight of}} the {{evidence}} in the claimant reemployment services demonstrations provides a strong case for providing intensive services to claimants along with strict enforcement of the work test. 18 In 2005, the US Department of Labor began providing grants to states to provide Reemployment and Eligibility Assessment (REA) to claimants. 19 The REA effort began with $ 18 million awarded to 21 states in 2005 and has grown to $ 65.5 million in 40 states in 2012.20 Although the initial impact evaluations reported in Benus et al. (2008) were based on nonexperimental methods in nine states, the later evaluation by Poe-Yamagata et al. (2011) uses experimental designs in four states. The impact evaluations based on random assignment in the Poe-Yamagata et al. (2011) study found large decreases in <b>benefit</b> <b>weeks</b> for three states (1.74  weeks in Florida, 1.14  weeks in Idaho, and 2.96  weeks in Nevada), but no impact in the fourth state, Illinois, which they attribute to inconsistent implementation and a small sample size. Although participation in the REA program is optional for states, a majority participate, and participating states are required to maintain a random sample of those eligible as a control group. This will permit the US Department of Labor to update its evaluations on an ongoing basis and see which variations are most successful in reducing benefits and assisting claimants.|$|R
30|$|For the {{empirical}} analyses in subsequent sections, I use the extended UI data (and matched CPS data) through 2011 only. This choice {{is based on}} measurement issues that distort the estimated impact of the post- 2011 reductions in PBD. The measurement issues reflect a fundamental asymmetry {{in the implementation of}} PBD changes caused by the state unemployment rate crossing a trigger threshold. An expansion causes an immediate increase in PBD for all eligible individuals, hence the timing and extent of the expansions is precisely measured. By contrast, when PBD is reduced in a state, individuals currently receiving benefits under the triggered-off program typically can continue to receive the full allotment of <b>benefit</b> <b>weeks</b> for which they qualified prior to the reduction in PBD. This allows them to continue receiving benefits for up to 20 weeks (4 to 5 months) after the rollback, which is the maximum number of weeks available through the EB program or the separate EUC tiers. As such, reductions in maximum weeks available provide very imprecise information about the timing of changes in PBD for affected individuals in a state, particularly {{in the context of the}} monthly frequency data that I use. The estimates for the post- 2011 sample are dominated by the resulting measurement error (biased toward zero) and hence are excluded from my analyses.|$|R

3000|$|WDP {{reforms in}} 2004 {{continued}} {{to focus on}} reducing the inflow of new recipients. However, the attention shifted away from tightening WDP eligibility requirements towards promoting worker accommodation on the job. Specifically, the reforms mandated employers to provide workplace reintegration management programs. Indeed, the law requires that when impaired workers exhaust their short-term sickness <b>benefits</b> (six <b>weeks)</b> and are being considered for longer-term sickness benefits, employers must coordinate a plan that includes input from: the sick-listed employee, WDP experts, the [...] worker council, and the workplace physician.

40|$|Economists often expect {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) benefits to elevate unemployment rates because recipients {{may choose to}} remain unemployed {{in order to continue}} receiving benefits, instead of accepting a job or dropping out of the labor force. This paper uses individual data from the Current Population Survey for the period between 2005 and 2013 - a period during which the federal government extended and then reduced the length of benefit availability to varying degrees in different states - to investigate the influence of program parameters in the UI system on monthly transition rates of unemployed individuals. The main finding is that unemployed job losers tend to remain unemployed until they exhaust UI benefits, at which point they become more likely {{to drop out of the}} labor force; transitions to a job appear to be unaffected by UI benefit extensions. These findings imply that the longer periods of benefit eligibility under the federal programs EUC 08 and EB - up to 99 weeks in many states in 2011 and 2012 - 2014;contributed to the elevated jobless rates observed during that period, but not via lower employment. By the same token, the sharp contraction of <b>benefit</b> <b>weeks</b> that occurred in 2012 and continued more gradually in 2013 likely contributed to declines in unemployment and participation rates beyond what one would expect based on the improving economy alone. Similarly, the December 28, 2013 sudden cutoff of federal UI payments to an estimated 1. 3 million jobless Americans who had been looking for work for more than six months is adding to the pace of transitions from unemployment to dropping out of the labor force, thus reducing the unemployment rate and the labor force participation rate further in the first half of 2014, although very modestly...|$|R
