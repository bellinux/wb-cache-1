2500|$|In April 2010, Wainwright {{came out}} {{publicly}} {{in favor of}} legalizing same-sex marriage in the United States {{because he wanted to}} marry his partner, Jörn Weisbrodt. Wainwright stated, [...] "I wasn’t a huge gay marriage supporter <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Jörn because I love the whole old-school promiscuous Oscar Wilde freak show of what 'being gay' once was. But since meeting Jörn that all changed." ...|$|E
2500|$|C. S. Lewis {{in his own}} {{preface to}} That Hideous Strength, notes: [...] "I believe {{that one of the}} central ideas of this tale came into my head from conversations I had with a {{scientific}} colleague, some time <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> a rather similar suggestion in the works of Mr. Olaf Stapledon. If I am mistaken in this, Mr. Stapledon is so rich in invention that he can afford to lend, and I admire his invention (though not his philosophy) so much that I should feel no shame to borrow".|$|E

6000|$|... "What {{an admirable}} young lady you are, and what jolly good company! We must be better acquainted, for never <b>before</b> have <b>I</b> <b>met</b> {{a girl with}} such {{exquisite}} coloring or such natural, artless manners." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "Find Your Love" [...] {{was written}} and co-produced by rapper Kanye West, making it his fourth {{collaboration}} with Drake after directing the video for [...] "Best I Ever Had", appearing in Jamie Foxx's song, [...] "Digital Girl" [...] along with The-Dream and featuring on [...] "Forever". When speaking to MTV News in 2009, Drake called the song's co-producer and rapper Kanye West, [...] "the most influential person on his sound", stating, [...] "Before I ever {{got the chance}} to meet him, Kanye West shaped a lot of what I do, as far as music goes, We always, always, always took the time to listen to Kanye's music and appreciate it beyond. We searched the samples and find out where his inspiration came from, because he has one of the best ears in music, period. He knows how to recognize great music that's not his. He knows how to utilize great sounds and great music. So <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, I had the utmost respect for Kanye West. I'd even go as far as to say he's the most influential person, as far as a musician, that I'd ever had in my life." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "A butler!" [...] He {{could now}} no longer {{restrain}} himself. [...] "I was weeks," [...] he said, [...] "getting it ready. Weeks and weeks.... It's a house.... I'd had {{my eye on}} it <b>before</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you. It's a real good house, Elly...." ...|$|R

5000|$|... “I {{am sorry}} that Jennifer {{did not realize}} the {{treasure}} that was Daniel when she had the chance, long <b>before</b> he and <b>I</b> <b>met</b> and long <b>before</b> he died,” Maraini-Melehi added.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I {{remember}} his {{saying that she}} was of German extraction, and I have seen her portrait. She was a very beautiful woman. She died of typhoid the year <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him." ...|$|E
60|$|I had not, however, gone twenty steps <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Ford Obert, who {{had entered}} the {{corridor}} {{from the other end}} and was, as he immediately let me know, {{on his way to the}} smoking-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "I guess I kept {{straight}} <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you," [...] {{she came}} back with a toss of the head. [...] "And I kept straight after I met you, which is going some if anybody should ask you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So Bell has urged; but he can't get Marple {{to spend}} a penny--I'm glad that man's new {{to this part of}} the country and doesn't belong to us. Well, just after <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Bell, Marple's big motor came along. He had Batley with him and the Crestwicks, who were down <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> think you <b>met</b> them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fenn. He {{met him at}} the Geneva Conference, {{the year}} <b>before</b> the war. <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, too, but I didn't see so much of him. He's a fine fellow, Julian--as unlike the typical German as any man you ever met." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{remembered that}} I {{had seen a}} {{horseman}} a moment <b>before</b> <b>I</b> had <b>met</b> the Emperor. He had taken to the fields to avoid me, but if I had known, and Violette been unwounded, the old soldier would not have gone unavenged. I was thinking sadly of his sword-play, and wondering whether it was his stiffening wrist which had been fatal to him, when Napoleon spoke again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Start {{by telling}} me what you did yesterday, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you and your friend {{on the road to}} this place," [...] replied Mr. Hawbury. [...] "We will say, you got up and had your breakfast. What next?" ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{all very}} plausible; and perhaps (in my {{innocent}} days <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with Frau Meyer) I might have thought it quite likely to be true. In my present frame of mind, I only asked the widow if I might see her sketch.|$|E
6000|$|This {{apparently}} {{gave some}} hope to Babington, for he answered--"Yes, I protest that, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> this Ballard, I never meant nor intended for {{to kill the}} Queen; but by his persuasions I was induced {{to believe that she}} being excommunicate it was lawful to murder her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lucy nodded. [...] "I saw you understood. <b>Before</b> we <b>met</b> <b>I</b> {{was rather}} jealous of you--and curious. I think Lawrence {{sometimes}} makes mistakes about people." ...|$|R
6000|$|One Thursday morning, when I {{was about}} to walk with Mr. Dick from the hotel to the coach office before {{going back to school}} (for we had an hour's school <b>before</b> breakfast), <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Uriah in the street, who {{reminded}} me of the promise I had made to take tea with himself and his mother: adding, with a writhe, 'But I didn't expect you to keep it, Master Copperfield, we're so very umble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is a {{pleasant}} sight to a true sealer, Captain Gar'ner," [...] observed Stimson, who as usual had kept near his officer, [...] "and one that I can say <b>I</b> never <b>before</b> saw equalled. I've {{been in this}} business now some five-and-twenty years, and never <b>before</b> have <b>I</b> <b>met</b> with so safe a harbour for a craft, and so large herds {{that have not been}} stirred up and got to be skeary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} may, for am I not {{to share in}} all your gold and glory? I have greater need of both than you. You already have all that mortal could desire. I don't believe I've told you what I called you <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you--have I?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear, I {{was just}} as wild and discontented as Jack <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you," [...] remarked Col. Zane. [...] "You may not think so, but a home and pretty little woman will do wonders for any man. My {{brothers}} have nothing to keep them steady." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do better. I see it. This was, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him, what I {{wondered}} whether I WAS to see. But {{as soon as}} I met him I ceased to wonder, and our second meeting made me sure. I took him all in. He was acting--he is still--on his daily instructions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "True--it doth, indeed, seem silly--and {{yet have}} <b>I</b> <b>before</b> <b>met</b> that frown in battle, and heard that sharp, quick voice, in a rally. By St. Iago de Compostello! I have it! Harkee, Diego!--a word in thy ear." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{had never}} met any one like you <b>before.</b> <b>I</b> have never <b>met</b> any one like you since. Why should you treat me as though I were {{something}} entirely contemptible, because I refused to accept your father's fraudulent balance sheet and put money into a ruined business?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Between 2009 and 2013, Kilbey has {{released}} three collaborative albums with Martin Kennedy of All India Radio. Kennedy explained {{the inception of}} the working relationship in a 2013 interview: [...] "I was working with Steve long <b>before</b> <b>I</b> actually <b>met</b> him. Steve had heard All India Radio, and he asked my brother John if I had any spare instrumental songs lying around that he could contribute lyrics to." [...] Kennedy subsequently sent Kilbey [...] "thrown-away tracks" [...] from All India Radio recording sessions.|$|R
6000|$|Jordan {{straightened}} himself resolutely. [...] "Stop there, Eleanor!" [...] he said. [...] "If you won't {{speak to}} him I can't compel you to, but, in this one thing, at least, you can't compel me. Jimmy was my friend <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you, and I'm standing by him now. Anyway, what has he done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am wiser because I have {{questioned}} things more than most, {{and to those}} who question answers come at last. And I am not married because another woman took the only man I wanted <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> him. That was my bad luck. Still, it taught me a great lesson, namely, how to wait and meanwhile to acquire understanding." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{attempt to}} answer Madame Pratolungo! I prefer admitting that Madame Pratolungo {{may have been}} quite right. I dare say I am ready {{to fall in love}} with the first man who comes my way. I dare say--if I had met your brother <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> you--I should have fallen in love with him. Quite likely!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thou makest no allowance, fisherman, for {{difference}} {{of years and}} for sinews that are in their vigor. Methinks that in adjudging such a prize, thought should be had to these matters, and then wouldest thou be found outstripping us all. Holy St. Theodore! I passed my childhood with the oar in hand, and never <b>before</b> have <b>I</b> <b>met</b> one in Venice who has driven my gondola so hard! Thou touchest the water with the delicacy of a lady fingering her harp, and yet {{with the force of}} the wave rolling on the Lido!" ...|$|R
5000|$|Holden recalls their romance: <b>Before</b> <b>I</b> even <b>met</b> her, <b>I</b> had a {{crush on}} her, and after <b>I</b> <b>met</b> her, just a day later, I felt as if we were old friends, and I was rather {{fiercely}} protective of her, though not in a possessive way. [...] Their relationship did not last much beyond the completion of the film. Holden, who was at this point dependent on alcohol, said, [...] "I really was in love with Audrey, but she wouldn't marry me." [...] Rumors at the time had it that Hepburn wanted a family, but when Holden told her that he'd had a vasectomy and having children was impossible, she moved on. A few months later, Hepburn met Mel Ferrer, whom she would later marry.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true, madamigella. I {{was always}} a priest to you; and now I see that I never could be otherwise. Ah, the wrong began many years <b>before</b> we <b>met.</b> <b>I</b> was trying to blame you a little"-- ...|$|R
