50|$|The NRU reactor {{is home to}} Canada's {{national}} {{facility for}} neutron scattering: the NRC Canadian Neutron <b>Beam</b> <b>Centre.</b> Neutron scattering is a technique where a beam of neutrons shines through a sample of material, and {{depending on how the}} neutrons scatter from the atoms inside, scientists can determine many details about the crystal structure and movements of the atoms within the sample.|$|E
5000|$|A beam {{of light}} has radial {{polarization}} if at every position in the beam the polarization (electric field) vector points towards {{the centre of the}} beam. In practice, an array of waveplates may be used to provide an approximation to a radially polarized beam. In this case the beam is divided into segments (eight, for example), and the average polarization vector of each segment is directed towards the <b>beam</b> <b>centre.</b>|$|E
50|$|The NRU reactor is {{sometimes}} (incorrectly) characterized {{as simply a}} nuclear research facility. Neutron scattering however is not nuclear research, it is materials research. Neutrons are an ideal probe of materials including metals, alloys, biomaterials, ceramics, magnetic materials, minerals, polymers, composites, glasses, nano-materials and many others. The neutron scattering instruments at the NRC Canadian Neutron <b>Beam</b> <b>Centre</b> are used by universities and industries from across Canada every year because knowledge of materials is important for innovation in many sectors.|$|E

5000|$|Green Archer solved {{this problem}} by quickly moving the antenna between two set {{vertical}} angles. The scanner was first set so it scanned back and forth near the horizon line. When a mortar shell was seen on the display, the operator used a grease pencil to mark its location. He then pressed a button that quickly raised the scanner so it was pointed at a higher vertical angle. This happened rapidly enough that the bomb would {{take some time to}} reach this higher altitude, at which point it would appear on the display again and this second location would also be marked. The operator them placed cursors over the marks and input the plot to the radar's analogue computer. [...] These two plots, the time between them and the angle between the two beam positions gave two points on a parabolic curve. Such a curve is defined by two points and is a good approximation of a mortar bomb trajectory. Using these, the azimuth of the radar <b>beam</b> <b>centre</b> and the radar's coordinates, the mortar position coordinates were calculated. These could be adjusted to reflect the actual height of the ground.|$|E

40|$|Ion beam centres {{are at the}} {{forefront}} of UK and international research and if they are to move forward, then the safety of the workers is paramount. As interest in this type of work increases, the potential hazards of new experiments also is heightened. This paper will create a set of safe operating procedures for the Stephens lab at The Surrey Ion <b>Beam</b> <b>Centre,</b> The University of Surrey, Guildford. Radiation exposure in the U. K. for workers is limited to 20 mSv per year so it is important that these levels are not exceeded. Calculations on the emission of neutrons in the facility showed minimum risk to workers but precautionary measures such as engineering controls and operational procedures were still suggested in this paper to maximise protection. 2 Acknowledgements Thanks to Chris Jeynes at the Ion <b>Beam</b> <b>Centre</b> for his support in this work and to Paddy for all his help and guidance when I was stressing out...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{experimental}} set-up was {{installed at the}} University of Surrey Ion <b>Beam</b> <b>Centre</b> {{for the purpose of}} producing 3 D quantitative elemental maps of biological samples by combining simultaneous Proton Induced X-Ray Emission Tomography (PIXE- T), on/off-Axis Scanning Transmission Ion Microscopy-Tomography (STIM-T) and Rutherford Backscatter Spectrometry (RBS). A tomographic sample holder was designed and built and a scattering system developed for On/Off-Axis STIM. 2 D PIXE and off-STIM analysis of leukocytes was performed to complement concurrent research and to identify problems with the very recently installed proton microbeam at the Ion <b>Beam</b> <b>Centre.</b> The other major aim was to see if a leukocyte would be a suitable sample for tomographic analysis and to study the damage induced by the beam on biological samples. Instrumental Neutron Activation Analysis (INAA) was performed on hair samples collected from MSc students at the University of Surrey and a database compiled of all elemental analysis of hair performed at the University. This complemented the tomographic analysis performed on a section of a strand of hair. Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Fe and Zn were mapped using simultaneous PIXE-T, On/Off- Axis STIM-T and RBS...|$|E
40|$|The use {{of fiber}} {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) {{by the civil}} engineering community spans more than two decades. It {{has been applied to}} many purposes for civil engineering structures not only for new structures but also for strengthening of the deteriorated structures. Many researches have been done to apply the FRP materials for strengthening, particularly due to an increase on load requirement, a change of use or due to a degradation problem or some design/construction defects. However, it is still very rarely studies on application of the FRP materials for strengthening of the yielded reinforced concrete members. This study presented the results of the application of GFRP sheet for strengthening of yielded reinforced concrete beams. A series of specimen of reinforced concrete beams with dimension of 15 cm x 20 cm x 270 cm were casted. All casted specimens were pre-load to the yielding of steel reinforcement before application of GFRP sheet. The specimens of the strengthened yielded beams using GFRP sheet were divided into four types which were: type FH- 1 was specimen with 1 layer on full length of the beam span, type FH- 12 was specimen with 1 layer on full length of the beam span added 1 layer with length of half of the beam span patched at the <b>beam</b> <b>centre,</b> type FH- 3 was specimen with 3 layer on full length of the beam span and type FH- 32 was specimen with 3 layer on full length of the beam span added 2 layer with length of half of the beam span patched at the <b>beam</b> <b>centre,</b> respectively. The results indicated that the flexural capacity of beams strengthened with one layer (type FH- 1) and two layers (type FH- 2) of GFRP sheet on overall length of beam were 26 kN and 35 kN, respectively. On the FH- 12 beams with one layer on full length added with two layer of GFRP with the length of half of the beam span at the <b>beam</b> <b>centre</b> indicated higher capacity which was 30 kN. Furthermore, on the FH- 32 beams with three layers of full length added with two layer of GFRP with the length of half of the beam span at the <b>beam</b> <b>centre</b> indicated higher capacity which was 42 kN. For the comparison, it was noted that the ultimate flexural capacity of strengthened concrete beams beyond that of original beam (ultimate capacity of original beam (BN) was 16. 5 kN). The presence of cracks influenced to the prematurely debonding of the GFRP laminate. This caused the limitation of the experimental ultimate capacity...|$|E
