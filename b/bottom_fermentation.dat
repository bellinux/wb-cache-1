50|$|Altbier (German: old beer) is a {{style of}} beer brewed in the {{historical}} region of Westphalia and around the city of Düsseldorf, Germany. Its name comes from it being top-fermented, an older method than the <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation</b> of other lagered beers.|$|E
50|$|Johann Evangelist Götz (Polish: Jan Ewangelista Goetz; born 16 November 1815, Langenenslingen, County of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen - died 14 March 1893, Brzesko, Poland) was a German-Polish brewer, {{the founder}} of the Okocim Brewery and father of Jan Albin Goetz (also known as Jan Albin Goetz-Okocimski) and the {{grandfather}} of Antoni Jan Goetz (Antoni Jan Goetz-Okocimski). He {{was one of the first}} brewers to introduce modern <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation</b> methods in Austria-Hungary (in Schwechat) and Poland (in Brzesko).|$|E
50|$|On 15 February 1864, Gerard Adriaan Heineken (1841-1893) got his wealthy {{mother to}} buy De Hooiberg (The Haystack) brewery in Amsterdam, a popular working-class brand founded in 1592. In 1873 after hiring a Dr. Elion (student of Louis Pasteur) to develop Heineken-A Yeast for Bavarian <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation,</b> the HBM (Heineken's Bierbrouwerij Maatschappij) was established, {{and the first}} Heineken brand beer was brewed. In 1875 Heineken won the Medaille D'Or at the International Maritime Exposition in Paris, then began to be shipped there regularly, after which Heineken sales topped 64,000 hectolitres (1.7 million U.S. gallons), making them the biggest beer {{exporter}} to France.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} and applications of biosensors {{in the food}} industry has had a rapid grown due to their sensitivity, specificity and simplicity of use with respect to classical analytical methods. In this study, glucose and ethanol amperometric biosensors integrated with a wireless telemetry system were developed and used for the monitoring of top and <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentations</b> in beer wort samples. The collected data were in good agreement with those obtained by reference methods. The simplicity of construction, the low cost and the short time of analysis, combined with easy interpretation of the results, suggest that these devices could be a valuable alternative to conventional methods for monitoring fermentation processes in the food industry...|$|R
50|$|In the brewing {{industry}} flocculation {{has a different}} meaning. It {{is a very important}} process in fermentation during the production of beer where cells form macroscopic flocs. These flocs cause the yeast to sediment or rise {{to the top of a}} fermentation at the end of the fermentation. Subsequently, the yeast can be collected (cropped) from the top (ale <b>fermentation)</b> or the <b>bottom</b> (lager <b>fermentation)</b> of the fermenter in order to be reused for the next fermentation. While it appears similar to sedimentation in colloidal dispersions, the mechanisms are different.|$|R
50|$|Beech wood is an {{excellent}} firewood, easily split and burning for many hours with bright but calm flames. Slats of beech wood are washed in caustic soda to leach out any flavor or aroma characteristics and are spread around the <b>bottom</b> of <b>fermentation</b> tanks for Budweiser beer. This provides a complex surface on which the yeast can settle, {{so that it does}} not pile up, preventing yeast autolysis which would contribute off-flavors to the beer. Beech logs are burned to dry the malt used in some German smoked beers, giving the beers their typical flavour. Beech is also used to smoke Westphalian ham, various sausages, and some cheeses.|$|R
5000|$|He left Bavaria in 1834 and {{traveled}} around Germany and Austria, working in various breweries. He finally settled in Klein-Schwechat, near Vienna, where he obtained {{a position of}} [...] "Cellarer" [...] in a brewery of another cousin, Anton. After {{a year and a}} half, he was promoted. As an assistant to his cousin over the course of six years, he improved and modernized the brewery so that eventually it became one of the best-run brewing enterprises in Austria-Hungary. It was during that time that Götz introduced the then-new technique of <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation,</b> which he would later utilize in his Okocim Brewery in Poland.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} brewery {{was established}} on 1 June 1879 by Herman Meijling and J.H. Bartelink as the Hengelosche Stoom Beiersch Bierbrouwerij, translated as the Hengelo Steam Bavarian Beer Brewery. Beiersch Bier {{refers to the}} German state of Bavaria, home of an innovative method of brewing that soon became the standard in brewing lager beers. Like other Dutch brewers in the 19th century, Meijling and Bartelink adapted the Bavarian brewing process of lager beer, using <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation</b> and cellar storages to mature the beer for several weeks. This approach resulted in typical clear lager, increased preservation and a smooth taste. The early adapters of this technology were able to increase their territory and market share, {{taking advantage of the}} extended sell by date.|$|E
50|$|For centuries {{the brewery}} only {{produced}} beer {{for the local}} market. It {{was not until the}} fourth generation of Swinkels took charge of the brewery that production was expanded. Jan Swinkels, born in 1851, started distribution to the city of Helmond at 10 km from Lieshout in 1890. Sales rose from 988 hectolitres of beer in 1890 to 1,900 hectolitres in 1900. After the First World War distribution was expanded to other towns and villages in North Brabant. By 1923 output had increased to 3,325 hectolitres of beer. By that time the original brewery buildings had become too small so a larger brewery was built in Lieshout. On that occasion three brothers of the fifth generation of Swinkels took over leadership, and adopted the brand name Bavaria. This name indicated that the new plant was a <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation</b> brewery, producing pale lager (Bavarian) beer.|$|E
30|$|Spent yeast samples (yeast cell slurry {{deposited}} at the <b>bottom</b> {{of ethanol}} <b>fermentation</b> tanks inoculated with Sachharomyces cereviceae) {{were provided by}} Bannari Amman Distilleries, Modur, and Erode. The slurry collected was centrifuged at lab level (6000 [*]rpm for 10 [*]min) and the resultant cell pellet was washed twice with water to discard chemical residues settled along with cells. This washed spent yeast cells were introduced to pressmud at 10 % (w/w) (if there was variation in inoculum percentage, the same was specifically mentioned) as inoculum.|$|R
25|$|When yeast cells die, they {{sink to the}} <b>bottom</b> of the <b>fermentation</b> vessel {{where they}} combine with {{insoluble}} tartrates, grape seeds, skin and pulp fragments to form the lees. During fermentation, the first significant racking which removes the bulk of dead yeast cells {{is often referred to}} as the gross lees as opposed to the less coarse fine lees that come as the wine continues to settle and age. During the time that the wine spends in contact with the lees, a number of changes can impact the wine due to both the autolysis (or self-metabolize) of the dead yeast cells as well as the reductive conditions that can develop if the lees are not aerated or stirred (a process that the French call bâtonnage). The length of time that a wine spends on its lees (called sur lie) will depend on the winemaking style and type of wine.|$|R
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} divided into two main parts. The first part is a compilation of {{available}} publications devoted to the beer production. This theoretical summary is focused mainly on the wort fermentation and discusses important and commonly used brewing yeast strains of the <b>bottom</b> and top <b>fermentation.</b> Moreover, the metabolism of yeast cells, resources essential to their life cycle and compounds that occur in the final product are described in the thesis. The second part of the thesis is a practical part containing data from the research focused on top-fermenting yeast strains available on the Czech market. The selected top-fermenting yeast strains were used for the wort fermentation created by the unified production technology. Obtained beer samples were subsequently analysed by laboratory techniques as well as by sensory analysis. In conclusion, this thesis compares the amount of the alcohol, true extract and original wort in individual beer samples. Additionally, the amount of residual sugars, and glycerol and ethanol levels in these samples were compared by HPLC analysis...|$|R
40|$|This final {{thesis is}} focused on topic of use the yeast strains in beer production. In first part of thesis is descripted brief {{overview}} of beer making process, its nutritional values, composition and also inputs needed for its production, namely malt, hops, water and yeast. Following part of thesis considers overall characteristics of yeast strains, their reproduction and their importance in food production industry. After general description the thesis {{is focused on}} characteristics of individual strains of yeast used in top and <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation</b> process, which are used in Czech Republic and also in foreign countries. In following point is discussed the characteristic of substances negatively influencing the dynamics and course of fermentation process. Consecutively the undesirable genera of yeasts are described, which could occur at wrong brewer's practice and could negatively alter the qualitative and sensoric properties of beer...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} popular and widely used {{alcoholic}} beverages is beer. There is a long-standing tradition of beer production in the Czech Republic and it is our significant export commodity. Hops, specifically the so called Saaz Late, is a typical ingredient in the production of bottom fermented a Pilsen kind of beer that has made us famous in the world. Beer is a complicated beverage and its production is not an easy process, although it may seem differently at first glance. Apart from the convenient ingredients, for the production of beer are also needed technological facilities and most importantly the knowledge. The procedure itself consists of grinding malt, mixing it with water and mashing process, which includes a shortage of polysaccharide chains by influence of malt enzymes. The extracted product is called hopped wort and it is further boiled together with hops. This process is in Czech language known as chmelovar (hereinafter referred to as wort). During the wort, there are some bitter substances coming to work (this is how mixture of ingredients and water is generally called during the whole process of production), the bitter substances are specifically alfa bitter acids and beta bitter acids. The extracted product is called hopped wort. After fermenting the hopped wort, there comes a stage of main and secondary fermentation. During this phase two crucial ingredients of beer are produced. Alcohol and carbon dioxide. Traditional for Czech regions is the <b>bottom</b> <b>fermentation</b> in which yeasts are descending to the base of a container. Biogenic amines are one of many components of the beer. However, they can be found not only in the beer, but also in almost all basic foods. We can find them in meat, fish, vegetables and fruits, and even in different concentrations. Their production is often associated with the fermentation process. Regarding the content of biogenic amines in beer, due to the research it is obvious that a part of them gets into the beer from the original raw materials. Another part arises during the fermentation process. Tyramine and histamine (among others), discovered in the beer, can have a serious impact on human health. During the consumption of large quantities of such a beer, but even other foods that contain a lot of these biogenic amines, it may affect the circulatory system, breathing, cause a facial flushing and in extreme cases even cerebral haemorrhage. The intoxication by histamine is often manifested as food poisoning or allergic reactions...|$|E
2500|$|Upon the {{introduction}} of active yeasts to the grape must, phosphates {{are attached to the}} sugar and the six-carbon sugar molecules begin to be split into three-carbon pieces and go through a series of rearrangement reactions. During this process, the carboxylic carbon atom is released in the form of carbon dioxide with the remaining components becoming acetaldehyde. The absence of oxygen in this [...] process allows the acetaldehyde to be eventually converted, by reduction, to ethanol. During the conversion of acetaldehyde, a small amount is converted, by oxidation, to acetic acid which, in excess, can contribute to the wine fault known as volatile acidity (vinegar taint). After the yeast has exhausted its life cycle, they fall to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>fermentation</b> tank as sediment known as lees. Yeast ceases its activity whenever all of the sugar in must has been converted into other chemicals or whenever the alcohol content has reached 15% alcohol per unit volume; a concentration strong enough to halt the enzymatic activity of almost all strains of yeast.|$|R
5000|$|During fermentation, yeast cells {{convert the}} {{sugar in the}} grape must into ethanol. When the sugar food source for the yeast and {{necessary}} nutrients such as nitrogen run out, or the alcohol level of the wine reaches such a point to where it is toxic for the yeast, the cells die and sink to the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>fermentation</b> vessel. These dead cells, or [...] "lees", are normally removed by racking the wine into a clean vessel. If the wine is left {{in contact with the}} lees, enzymes start to break the cells down producing mannoproteins (mannose-containing glycoproteins) and polysaccharides that are released into the wine. In sparkling wine production, a wine is made [...] "sparkling" [...] or [...] "bubbly" [...] because a secondary fermentation is introduced when the wine is contained within a sealed wine bottle. During this time the wine is deliberately kept in contact with its lees inside the bottle for a period ranging from a couple months to several years. Studies have shown that the chemical reaction of autolysis, {{and its impact on the}} wine, starts to become noticeable after 18 months and will continue to impart traits for at least 5 years. The sparkling wine is eventually separated from its lees through a technique known as riddling and disgorgement.|$|R
30|$|In {{accordance}} with the brewing process of traditional Chinese strong flavor liquor (Yan et al. 2015 a, b), raw materials (sorghum, rice, glutinous, rice, maize, and wheat) were crushed into pieces and splashed with hot water (~[*] 70  °C) {{at a ratio of}} 1 : 0.25. After approximately 1  h, the wet mixed grains were further mixed with steamed rice husks and the fermented Zaopei obtained from the previous stage of fermentation. Then this mixture was transferred into a distillatory for liquor distillation. After distillation, the multiple-grain Zaopei was mixed with starter Chinese Daqu as a process-defined ratio, placed into pits, covered by pit mud, and subjected to fermentation. Control pits were then fermented using natural conditions for 70  days. For the experimental pits, part of the upper pit mud was moved and 500  L of the co-culture fermentation broth was added into the Zaopei from the top to the <b>bottom</b> after ethanol <b>fermentation</b> was almost complete (~[*] 20  days in this study). Experimental pits were then sealed with pit mud and again subjected to fermentation for another 50  days. After fermentation, the fermented Zaopei from the test and control pits was collected and distilled with steam to extract the ethanol and other flavour compounds. The quality of each raw liquor was then evaluated as a means of assessing the various pit-entry fermentation conditions.|$|R
40|$|Normal {{operation}} of packed bed bioreactors used for solid-state fermentation involves a static bed aerated from the <b>bottom</b> throughout the <b>fermentation.</b> This leads to axial temperature profiles {{with the highest}} temperature, sometimes over 20 degrees C higher than the inlet air temperature, occurring {{at the top of}} the bed. An axial heat transfer model was used to explore two strategies designed to prevent the temperature reaching undesirable levels, namely periodic reversal of the direction of airflow, and periodic mixing. Simulations were done for the growth of Aspergillus niger on a starchy substrate. The bed was assumed to be wide enough such that the radial heat transfer could be ignored. With hourly air reversal or mixing events, the maximum temperature predicted during the fermentation is higher than the maximum temperature predicted for normal operation. Increasing the frequency of air reversals leads to temperatures close to the maximum for growth in the middle of the bed. However, for a 0. 345 m high bed and a superficial air velocity of 0. 0236 m s(- 1), mixing 10 - 60 times per hour can lead to lower maximum temperatures in the column compared to normal operation, because the frequent mixing distributes the benefits of the effective cooling at the bottom of the column throughout the bed. The degree of reduction in maximum temperature increases with increasing specific growth rate of the microorganism. Modelling is a useful tool in guiding experimental programs for the design and scale-up of bioreactors for solid-state fermentation, since it can be used to identify promising strategies and eliminate unfruitful strategies.

40|$|Although {{there are}} countless types of beer, all ofthem {{can be broken down}} into either lagers or ales. This has to do with whether active {{fermentation}} occurs on the top or the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>fermentation</b> chamber. For the purposes of home brewing, lagering is slightly more impractical. For this reason, I have created three different home brewed ales. These different types of beer range in a variety of color, brewing process, and alcohol content. There are two majorly accepted types of home brewing: extract and all grain. Extract brewing is where the IImash" or slurry of grains has been condensed into a thick syrup. This type of brewing requires less equipment and less time investment on the brewing day itself. All grain brewing is where the brewer starts from scratch. I have created one extract batch and two all grain batches. Furthermore, a written analysis of my brewing and researching experience is given. After the brewing process was complete, I chemically analyzed a few of their characteristics. I will collect light spectroscopy data, pH, and hydrometer data. With the art of brewing, there are a few different standard characteristics that are important to the consumer: color, alcohol content and bitterness. By utilizing light spectroscopy, the darkness of the beer can be made quantitative. This is a useful tool when it comes to comparison of similar industrial brews. Alcohol content is another important characteristic that was analyzed. A hydrometer was used to obtain data {{in order to make a}} rough estimate of percent alcohol. lastly, I will analyze the bitterness of each beer through the pH. Once the lab analysis is complete, I plan to hold a beer-tasting event at an off-campus venue. Here I will discuss the brewing process, chemical analysis, and personal experience. Because this project is not a full scale "research" project, I have created a compilation of my work. There are multiple sections in this compilation including: scientific review of the fermentation process, data section, step-by-step personal brewing experience, and photo documentation of my work. The reason that I chose this process is that it intertwines both science and art. The brewing process and chemical analysis are rooted in my major (biochemistry). Furthermore, the art of brewing is something that I have wanted to pursue. After I graduate with a biochemistry degree, I plan to go on to a graduate program for brewing. This project will be a great a stepping stone and resume builder for my career. This being said, my target audience is the scientific community of ages 21 or older. Through this project, I hope to show Ball State University's future chemistry students that chemistry can be creative and fun. Furthermore, I feel as though people from other majors can appreciate the work put into this project. I feel that this project has the potential to attract undecided students to the chemistry department. To many, brewing seems like an intangible process. I believe this to be a misconception. By providing a written breakdown of the brewing process, I hope to change preconceived notions of intangibility into something very real and comprehendible. It is important to know exactly what you are putting into your body. I hope to educate others on not only what they are consuming, but where it came from. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
