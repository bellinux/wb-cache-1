5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar framework in Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Yosef Blau, {{a spiritual}} adviser to {{students}} at Modern Orthodoxy's flagship Yeshiva University, said that Y.U. and its affiliated seminary rarely adopt official policies regulating where students are allowed to worship, though {{they are expected to}} follow Orthodox teachings. <b>But,</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> even when top members of the Y.U. rabbinical faculty do come out against a controversial practice, such as women-only prayer groups involving Torah reading, graduates often continue to chart their own course without being sanctioned.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Rex Stout's widow in October 1984, the Stout estate {{approved}} {{the continuation of the}} Nero Wolfe series. In 1986 journalist Robert Goldsborough published the first of seven Nero Wolfe mysteries issued by Bantam Books. Goldsborough's approach was faithful to the Rex Stout works, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> his own touches, including an updated frame of reference (Archie now uses a personal computer to file Wolfe's germination records; Wolfe's ancient elevator is finally replaced by a more efficient model; etc.). Goldsborough's first effort, Murder in E Minor (1986), was a bestseller, and was hailed as an excellent mystery. Goldsborough often drew on his own background in advertising, education and journalism for color and detail.|$|E

25|$|Romney named Representative Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential {{running mate}} in August 2012. A year earlier, in June 2011, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives had passed a Republican {{alternative}} budget proposed by Ryan, with no Democrats voting for it. One controversial {{aspect of the}} proposal concerned Medicare; for those under age 55 as of its enactment, it would replace the existing Medicare {{system in which the}} government pays doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers fees for services rendered with a system in which the government would instead pay vouchers (also referred to as premium-support subsidies) to Medicare beneficiaries, who could then use their vouchers to either buy private medical insurance or to obtain coverage in a plan similar to traditional Medicare. Romney said that as president he would sign such a plan if it reached his desk, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> that he would be putting forward his own plan before debating Obama.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, at {{the court}} of Svatopluk, who himself professed the Latin Rite, intrigues against Methodius and the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic {{gathered}} strength. Svatopluk sent John of Venice, a known opponent of the Slavic liturgy, to Rome in 879 to achieve a settlement of ecclesiastical differences. In a letter addressed to Methodius in the same year, the Pope sharply rebuked him for using Slavonic in church services. Methodius, however, travelled to Rome in 880, together with a Moravian delegation. Under his influence Pope John VIII {{changed his mind and}} in a letter, known for its incipit, Industriae tuae, the Pope repeated that Mass was to be sung in Latin whenever requested, but he also allowed the use of Slavonic liturgy. The letter also confirmed the decision taken by the Holy See during Rastislav's reign to create an archdiocese for Great Moravia. Upon Svatopluk's request the Pope promoted a German priest, Witching, to be Bishop of Nitra, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> that the new Bishop and all the clerics in Great Moravia were expected to be obedient to Methodius, who remained the head of the church in Svatopluk's realms.|$|E

500|$|Milan were {{similarly}} astonished at {{the manner in}} which they had lost the final. Manager Carlo Ancelotti said, [...] "We had six minutes of madness in which we threw away the position we had reached until then". The result compounded Milan's failure to win Serie A a week before the match. Milan's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, played down the loss, asserting: [...] "Even if we come second in the league, and second in the Champions League, this is not a disastrous season for us".

[...] When Jones was faced with the prospect of a pay cut, he approached Hogan on the street and demanded that he be released from his contract immediately.

His parents were first cousins and {{descendants}} of Huguenot refugees who had fled to England in 1685 following the revocation of the Edict of Nantes. Jacques Planché was a moderately prosperous watchmaker, a trade he had learned in Geneva, and was personally known to King George III.

500|$|The title track, [...] "Enamorada de Ti", {{received}} a favorable review from Guerra, {{who believed that}} its merengue version [...] "manages to work up a considerable sweat". Calling it a [...] "tropical rhythm", Banda noted {{that it is the}} earliest-recorded track on the album. Lopetegui considered it [...] "crowd-pleasing". Lovelace thought it [...] "enjoyable", saying that the merengue mix version [...] "adds a lively, tropical tone to the original slow tempo love song", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> that it [...] "seems awkwardly paired when it comes to collaborating artists, who often clash with Selena's voice and the overall sound". Of the acoustic bonus tracks, Guerra wrote that they are [...] "unlikely highlights, the new instrumentation gives them all a nice edge and highlights Selena's burgeoning vocal prowess". Banda was more positive, listing them as recommended tracks that he found to be reminiscent of live Selena recordings.|$|E
500|$|Connor {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared with other}} male characters of the series {{in terms of the}} presentation and evolution of masculinity in fiction. His sexual relation with his surrogate mother, coupled with his struggles to kill his father, led to numerous speculations that mythical Greek figure Oedipus was the inspiration for the character. and references to Arthurian Legend were also made. In Erin B. Waggoner's book Sexual rhetoric in the works of Joss Whedon, he found it interesting that the ancient Oedipus complex continues {{to be used as a}} way to underscore one's masculinity, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> that [...] "Connor is not the only one [...] Angel, Wes, Spike and even Fred (through Gunn) kill father or father figures in order to come into their own as individuals." [...] Further citing Gwen's role among Connor and Gunn in the comic series triangle, he observed the unrelenting use of women as a device for men to shore up.|$|E
500|$|Although retired, Goodman {{remained}} {{active in}} Order of the Arrow affairs during the 1960s and 1970s.

Nelson Block writes in A Thing of the Spirit, {{that even in}} the 1970s the octogenarian founder [...] "crisscrossed the country to attend lodge and section events... surrounded by young Arrowmen...witty and charming, keeping everyone enthralled with his stories."
