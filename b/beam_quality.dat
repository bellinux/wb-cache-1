5|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the green}} part of the spectrum are widely available {{to the general public}} {{in a wide range of}} output powers. Green laser pointers outputting at 532nm (563.5 THz) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power, and are very popular due to their good <b>beam</b> <b>quality</b> and very high apparent brightness. The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state (DPSS) technology to create the green light. An infrared laser diode at 808nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium-doped yttrium vanadium oxide (Nd:YVO4) or neodymium-doped yttrium aluminium garnet (Nd:YAG) and induces it to emit 281.76 THz (1064nm). This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium, titanium and phosphorus (KTP), whose non-linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam (563.5 THz); in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532nm ("green"). Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501nm to 543nm. Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers, including the helium–neon laser (543nm), the Argon-ion laser (514nm) and the Krypton-ion laser (521nm and 531nm), as well as liquid dye lasers. Green lasers have a wide variety of applications, including pointing, illumination, surgery, laser light shows, spectroscopy, interferometry, fluorescence, holography, machine vision, non-lethal weapons and bird control.|$|E

25|$|Uses {{of laser}} diodes can be {{categorized}} in various ways. Most applications could be served by larger solid-state lasers or optical parametric oscillators, but the low cost of mass-produced diode lasers makes them essential for mass-market applications. Diode lasers {{can be used in}} a great many fields; since light has many different properties (power, wavelength, spectral and <b>beam</b> <b>quality,</b> polarization, etc.) it is useful to classify applications by these basic properties.|$|E

25|$|Lasers {{emitting}} in {{the blue}} region of the spectrum became widely {{available to the public}} in 2010 with the release of inexpensive high-powered 445-447nm laser diode technology. Previously the blue wavelengths were accessible only through DPSS which are comparatively expensive and inefficient, however these technologies are still widely used by the scientific community for applications including optogenetics, Raman spectroscopy, and particle image velocimetry, due to their superior <b>beam</b> <b>quality.</b> Blue gas lasers are also still commonly used for holography, DNA sequencing, optical pumping, and other scientific and medical applications.|$|E
25|$|Earthquakes, even if {{they were}} {{thousands}} of miles away, did cause strong enough movements in the magnets to negatively affect the <b>beam</b> <b>quality</b> and even disrupt it. Therefore, tiltmeters were installed on Tevatron's magnets to monitor minute movements and to help identify the cause of problems quickly. The first known earthquake to disrupt the beam was the 2002 Denali earthquake, with another collider shutdown caused by a moderate local quake on June 28, 2004. Since then, the minute seismic vibrations emanating from over 20 earthquakes were detected at the Tevatron without a shutdown, like the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, the 2005 Nias–Simeulue earthquake, New Zealand's 2007 Gisborne earthquake, the 2010 Haiti earthquake and the 2010 Chile earthquake.|$|E
25|$|The {{adoption}} of high power fiber lasers as an industrial material processing tool has been ongoing {{for several years}} and is now expanding into other markets including the medical and scientific markets. One key enhancement enabling penetration into the scientific market has been the improvements in high finesse fiber amplifiers, which are now capable of delivering single frequency linewidths (<5nbsp&kHz) together with excellent <b>beam</b> <b>quality</b> and stable linearly polarized output. Systems meeting these specifications, have steadily progressed {{in the last few years}} from a few Watts of output power, initially to the 10s of Watts and now into the 100s of Watts power level. This power scaling has been achieved with developments in the fiber technology, such as the {{adoption of}} stimulated brillouin scattering (SBS) suppression/mitigation techniques within the fiber, along with improvements in the overall amplifier design. The latest generation of high finesse, high power fiber amplifiers now deliver power levels exceeding what is available from commercial solid-state single frequency sources and are opening up new scientific applications as a result of the higher power levels and stable optimized performance.|$|E

A total accelerator length {{is determined by}} an operating plasma density and a coupling distance allowed for both laser and beam focusing systems. We investigate beam dynamics and synchrotron radiation due to the betatron oscillation of the beam in laser-plasma acceleration, characterizing the <b>beam</b> <b>qualities</b> such as energy spread and transverse emittance. According to the criteria on the <b>beam</b> <b>qualities</b> for applications and available laser sources, the operating plasma density will be optimized.

50|$|Helium-neon (HeNe) lasers {{can be made}} to {{oscillate}} at over 160 different wavelengths by adjusting the cavity Q to peak at the desired wavelength. This can be done by adjusting the spectral response of the mirrors or by using a dispersive element (Littrow prism) in the cavity. Units operating at 633 nm are very common in schools and laboratories because of their low cost and near perfect <b>beam</b> <b>qualities.</b>|$|R
40|$|Kerma-area product (KAP) meters have a {{pronounced}} energy dependence when measuring air KAP for lightly filtered X-ray beams (RQR). Today, {{it is also}} common with more heavily filtered beams. In this work, the energy dependence for lightly as well as heavily filtered beams (RQC) was investigated for several KAP meter models. The relative energy dependence of the readings of an external and an internal KAP meter was determined relative to an ionisation chamber, which had been calibrated at the primary standards laboratory. As a complement to the measurements, the sensitivity of a KAP meter for various X-ray <b>beam</b> <b>qualities</b> was modelled using Monte Carlo simulations of photon transport and absorption. The result showed a variation in relative energy dependence of up to 30 %for KAP meters for RQC <b>beam</b> <b>qualities</b> compared with RQR qualities. A reduced sensitivity of KAP meters for heavily filtered beams in comparison with lightly filtered ones was found, {{and it is important}} that the beam-specific radiation quality correction factors are applied to correct the registered KAP values...|$|R
2500|$|In the {{confocal}} cavity a ray, {{which is}} deviated {{from its original}} direction in the middle between the of the cavity, is maximally (compared to other cavities) displaced on the return to the middle. This prevents amplified spontaneous emission and is important for a good <b>beam</b> <b>quality</b> and [...] high power amplifiers. In wave optics this is expressed by the eigenvalue degeneration of the modes. On every turn to the left, the 0,0 mode and the 1,0 mode are 90° out of phase, but on the turn back, they are 180° out of phase [...] Interference of the modes then leads to a displacement.|$|E
2500|$|Laser <b>beam</b> <b>quality</b> is {{quantified}} by {{the beam}} parameter product (BPP). For a Gaussian beam, the BPP {{is the product}} of the beam's divergence and waist size [...] The BPP of a real beam is obtained by measuring the beam's minimum diameter and far-field divergence, and taking their product. The ratio of the BPP of the real beam to that of an ideal Gaussian beam at the same wavelength is known as M2 ("M squared"). The M2 for a Gaussian beam is one. All real laser beams have M2 values greater than one, although very high quality beams can have values very close to one.|$|E
50|$|General Atomics {{revealed}} in April 2015 that its Gen 3 High Energy Laser (HEL) completed <b>beam</b> <b>quality</b> and power measurements tests. The Gen 3 laser {{has a number}} of upgrades that provide improved <b>beam</b> <b>quality,</b> increased electrical to optical efficiency, and reduced size and weight; the assembly is small at only 1.3 x 0.4 x 0.5 m, and is powered by a compact Lithium-ion battery to demonstrate deployability on tactical platforms. <b>Beam</b> <b>quality</b> remained constant through the 30-second demonstration, proving that the <b>beam</b> <b>quality</b> of electrically-pumped lasers can be maintained above 50 kilowatts. General Atomics plans to have the laser module deployable on their Avenger unmanned aerial vehicle by 2018. Demonstrating sufficient laser power and <b>beam</b> <b>quality</b> ended the program's laboratory development phase and achieved acceptance for field trials. Ground-based field testing will assess its effects against rockets, mortars, vehicles, and surrogate surface-to-air missiles.|$|E
