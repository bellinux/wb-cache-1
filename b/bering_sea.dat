5|$|After repairs at the New York Navy Yard from 25 April to 26 July, Yorktown retraced her route {{south and}} sailed again around Cape Horn {{back into the}} Pacific. She then moved north to resume patrolling the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> She {{protected}} seal rookeries into 1894 before returning to Mare Island for repairs which lasted into mid-September.|$|E
5|$|In the North Pacific, {{they feed}} on euphausiids in the genera Euphausia, Thysanoessa, and Nyctiphanes, large copepods in the genus Neocalanus, small {{schooling}} fish (e.g. the genera Engraulis, Mallotus, Clupea, and Theragra), and squid. Based on stomach {{content analysis of}} over 19,500 fin whales caught by the Japanese whaling fleet in the North Pacific from 1952 to 1971, 64.1% contained only krill, 25.5% copepods, 5.0% fish, 3.4% krill and copepods and 1.7% squid. Nemoto (1959) analysed the stomach contents of about 7500 fin whales caught in the northern North Pacific and <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> from 1952 to 1958, found that they mainly preyed on euphausiids around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska and schooling fish in the northern <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> and off Kamchatka. In the northern <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> (north of 58°N), their main prey species were capelin (Mallotus villosus), Alaska pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) and Pacific herring (Clupea pallasii); they also consumed saffron cod (Eleginus gracilis). Arctic krill (Thysanoessa raschii) was the only species of euphausiid found in the stomachs of fin whales in the northern <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> Off Kamchatka, they appeared to primarily feed on herring. They also took large quantities of the copepod Neocalanus cristatus around the Aleutian Islands and in Olyutorsky Bay off northeast Kamchatka, areas where the species was abundant. Five species of euphausiid (Euphausia pacifica, Thysanoessa spinifera, T. inermis, T. raschii, and T. longipes) were the predominant prey around the Aleutian Islands and in the Gulf of Alaska. Prey varied by region in the Kuril Islands area, with euphausiids (T. longipes, T. inermis, and T. raschii) and copepods (Neocalanus plumchrus and N. cristatus) being the main prey in the northern area and Japanese flying squid (Todarodes pacificus pacificus) and small schooling fish (e.g. Pacific saury, Cololabis saira; and Japanese anchovy, Engraulis japonicus) dominating the diet in the southern area.|$|E
5|$|Over the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea,</b> {{the three}} B-29s {{maintained}} radio contact with each other, communicating positions hourly as they navigated independently. Near the Arctic Circle, the magnetic compasses fluctuated wildly, and the fliers ignored them, relying {{instead on the}} radio compass. In Number 2, the radio compass stopped working as well, but it resumed working later in the flight.|$|E
5|$|Summer {{distribution}} of fin whales in the North Pacific is the immediate offshore waters from central Baja California to Japan {{and as far}} north as the Chukchi Sea bordering the Arctic Ocean. They occur in high densities in the northern Gulf of Alaska and southeastern <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> between May and October, with some movement through the Aleutian passes {{into and out of the}} <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> Several whales tagged between November and January off southern California were killed in the summer off central California, Oregon, British Columbia, and in the Gulf of Alaska. Fin whales have been observed feeding 250 miles south of Hawaii in mid-May, and several winter sightings have been made there. Some researchers have suggested that the whales migrate into Hawaiian waters primarily in the autumn and winter.|$|E
5|$|A large {{population}} spreads across the Hawaiian Islands every winter, {{ranging from the}} island of Hawaii {{in the south to}} Kure Atoll in the north. These animals feed in areas ranging from the coast of California to the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> Humpbacks were first observed in Hawaiian waters in the mid-19th century and might have gained a dominance over North Pacific right whales, as the right whales were hunted to near-extinction.|$|E
5|$|Although no general {{arbitration}} {{treaty was}} entered into, Taft's administration settled several disputes with Great Britain by peaceful means, often involving arbitration. These included {{a settlement of}} the boundary between Maine and New Brunswick, a long-running dispute over seal hunting in the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> that also involved Japan, and a similar disagreement regarding fishing off Newfoundland. The sealing convention remained in force until abrogated by Japan in 1940.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} in the Coast Mountains, the Yukon River flows northwest, {{across the}} Yukon–Alaska border, until it intersects the Porcupine River at {{the settlement of}} Fort Yukon. At that point, the river turns west and southwest, flowing through the Yukon Flats, a low-lying wetland area containing thousands of ponds, streams, and other small bodies of water. As the river flows southwest, it intersects the Tanana and Koyukuk rivers before looping south, then north into Norton Sound in the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Karluk left Esquimalt on 17 June 1913, sailing north towards Alaska. The {{immediate}} destination was Nome, {{on the coast}} of the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> There was trouble from the beginning with the steering gear and with the engines, both of which needed frequent attention. On 2 July Karluk reached the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> in mist, fog and rapidly falling temperatures; six days later she arrived at Nome where she joined Alaska and Mary Sachs. While the ships were being loaded in Nome, some of the scientists pressed for a meeting with the leader to clarify plans, particularly with regard to the Northern Party whose schedule was vague. The meeting was unsatisfactory. Stefansson's attitude offended several of the men, some of whom threatened to leave the expedition. They had read press reports in which Stefansson had apparently said that he expected Karluk to be crushed, and that the lives of the staff were secondary to the scientific work. Stefansson would not explain these matters, nor give further details of his plans for the Northern Party. Despite the scientists' alarm and dissatisfaction, none resigned.|$|E
5|$|Mallards are {{differentiated}} {{in their}} mitochondrial DNA between North American and Eurasian populations, but the nuclear genome displays a notable lack of genetic structure. Haplotypes typical of American mallard relatives and spotbills {{can be found}} in mallards around the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> The Aleutian Islands hold a population of mallards that appear to be evolving towards a subspecies, as gene flow with other populations is very limited.|$|E
5|$|The rest of {{the year}} (late summer and fall), {{walruses}} tend to form massive aggregations {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals on rocky beaches or outcrops. The migration between the ice and the beach can be long-distance and dramatic. In late spring and summer, for example, several hundred thousand Pacific walruses migrate from the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> into the Chukchi Sea through the relatively narrow Bering Strait.|$|E
5|$|Arriving at Port Townsend, Washington, on 30 April, Yorktown put to sea on 13 May, {{arriving}} at Iliuliuk, Unalaska, one week later. Coaling there, the gunboat skirted the ice floes near the seal rookeries of the Pribilof Islands, reconnoitering the vicinity for sealers. Assisted by a revenue cutter, Yorktown guarded the passes to the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> The crews of the patrolling American ships lacked fresh provisions but carried on {{in spite of}} the hardships imposed by both diet and climate. Fresh fish, however, proved abundant. Codfish was the staple with an occasional gourmet treat of salmon.|$|E
5|$|Later on August6, the {{weakening}} trend briefly halted as outflow significantly improved {{due to an}} {{area of low pressure}} north of Meranti. However, wind shear drastically increased, displacing convection to the northwest of the circulation center. By this time, the storm began to undergo an extratropical transition. Due to the influence of a major shortwave trough approaching from the west, Meranti took a sharp northward turn. The JTWC issued their final advisory on {{the weakening}} cyclone around 0600UTC on August8. The JMA continued to monitor Meranti as a tropical cyclone until August9. Shortly after becoming extratropical, the remnants of the storm executed a slow, counter-clockwise loop until August12. Shortly after crossing the International Date Line on August13, the storm was absorbed by a large non-tropical low over the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Shenandoah {{destroyed}} {{one more}} prize in the Sea of Okhotsk, north of Japan, then continued to the Aleutians {{and into the}} <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> and Arctic Ocean, crossing the Arctic Circle on June 19. Continuing then south {{along the coast of}} Alaska the Shenandoah came upon a fleet of Union ships whaling on June 22. She opened continuous fire, destroying a major portion of the Union whaling fleet. Capt. Waddell took aim at a fleeing whaler, Sophia Thornton, and at his signal, the gunner jerked a wrist strap and fired the last two shots of the American Civil War. Shenandoah had so far captured and burned eleven ships of the American whaling fleet while in Arctic waters.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} global climate change are another element of concern. The extent and {{thickness}} of the pack ice has reached unusually low levels in several recent years. The walrus relies on this ice while giving birth and aggregating in the reproductive period. Thinner pack ice over the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> has reduced the amount of resting habitat near optimal feeding grounds. This more widely separates lactating females from their calves, increasing nutritional stress for the young and lower reproductive rates. Reduced coastal sea ice has also been implicated in the increase of stampeding deaths crowding the shorelines of the Chukchi Sea between eastern Russia and western Alaska. However, there are insufficient climate data to make reliable predictions on population trends.|$|E
5|$|Vitus Bering {{had been}} a {{prominent}} sailor in Russia. After successful expeditions in 1725, 1728, and 1730, Bering was sent to explore {{what is now the}} <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> area of the Pacific in 1740. He soon settled on Kamchatka, where he started a settlement and built two additional vessels, dubbed St. Peter and St. Paul. In 1741 Bering and his company started towards North America, but were stalled by a storm and in being delayed were forced to take land. During the storm they could not make out the Alaskan coast. The storm proved too powerful so the ships turned around, along the way charting several of the Aleutians, including Gareloi. Since then, it has been barely studied, resulting in a fragmentary knowledge of its eruptions and possibly even unrecorded episodes.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} major {{operations}} in which the ships were involved was Operation Eagle Claw launched by USS Nimitz in 1980 after she had deployed to the Indian Ocean {{in response to the}} taking of hostages in the U.S. embassy in Tehran. Although initially part of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet, Eisenhower relieved Nimitz in this operation after her service in the Mediterranean Sea. Nimitz conducted a Freedom of Navigation exercise alongside the aircraft carrier USS Forrestal in August 1981 in the Gulf of Sidra, near Libya. During this exercise, two of the ship's F-14 Tomcats shot down two Libyan aircraft in {{what became known as the}} Gulf of Sidra incident. In 1987, Vinson participated in the first U.S. carrier deployment in the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea,</b> and Nimitz provided security during the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul.|$|E
5|$|Returning to New York on 13 June 1892, Concord {{made another}} cruise to the West Indies late that year, and arrived back at Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 December. She participated in International Naval Review held at Norfolk and New York in March and April 1893, and in June sailed from Norfolk for the Far East, calling at the Azores, Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Bangkok, and Saigon before {{arriving}} at Hong Kong on 30 October. She cruised on the Asiatic Station until 29 May 1894 {{when she arrived}} at Unalaska. She cruised on sealing patrol in the North Pacific {{to carry out the}} provisions of the treaty between the United States and United Kingdom, which empowered Concord to seize any vessel violating the laws protecting valuable fur seals. She gathered hydrographic information to correct <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> charts and conduct scientific observations of the fur seals.|$|E
5|$|The North Pacific {{right whale}} appears {{to occur in}} two {{population}}s. The population in the eastern North Pacific/Bering Sea is extremely low, numbering about 30 individuals. A larger western population of 100–200 appears to be surviving in the Sea of Okhotsk, but very {{little is known about}} this population. Thus, the two northern right whale species are the most endangered of all large whales and two of the most endangered animal species in the world. Based on current population density trends, both species are predicted to become extinct within 200 years. The Pacific species was historically found in summer from the Sea of Okhotsk in the west to the Gulf of Alaska in the east, generally north of 50°N. Today, sightings are very rare and generally occur in the mouth of the Sea of Okhotsk and in the eastern <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> Although this species is very likely to be migratory like the other two species, its movement patterns are not known.|$|E
5|$|The {{military}} {{history of the}} Aleutian Islands began almost immediately following the purchase of Alaska by the United States. Prior to the early 20th century, the Aleutian Islands were essentially ignored by the military of the United States, although the islands played a small role in the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Arbitration when a number of British and American vessels were stationed at Unalaska to enforce the arbitrators' decision. By the early 20th century, a number of war strategies examined the possibility of conflict breaking out between the Empire of Japan and the United States. While the Aleutian Islands were seen as a potential staging point for invasions by either side, this possibility was dismissed owing to the islands' dismal climate. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed, after which the United States Navy began to {{take an interest in}} the islands. However, nothing of significance was to materialize until World War Two.|$|E
5|$|In 1853, {{prior to}} the {{purchase}} of Alaska by the United States, the United States Navy sent the USS Fenimore Cooper to the Aleutian Islands {{with the aim of}} locating potential harbors and find coal deposits. No coal deposits were found. In 1867, the United States purchased Alaska from the Russian Empire. By 1869, a number of military posts had been established by the Government of the United States, although the Aleutian Islands did not receive such a post, with the nearest post being located on Kodiak Island. The United States Army made the decision to leave the exploration of the Aleutians to the United States Navy, and the latter showed little interest in doing so. The Aleutian Islands played a small role in the ongoing sealing dispute between the United Kingdom and the United States, which later culminated in the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Arbitration. In 1888, following what the United States Government saw as an infringement on the nation's sovereignty by Canadian and Japanese sealers, the United States Navy sent a number of its ships to Unalaska to police the foreign sealers. By 1891, an accord had been reached between the United Kingdom and the United States, and for some time a number of British and American vessels remained in Unalaska to enforce the deal.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} {{of the population of the}} Pacific walrus spends its summers north of the Bering Strait in the Chukchi Sea of the Arctic Ocean along the northern coast of eastern Siberia, around Wrangel Island, in the Beaufort Sea along the north shore of Alaska south to Unimak Island, and in the waters between those locations. Smaller numbers of males summer in the Gulf of Anadyr on the southern coast of the Siberian Chukchi Peninsula, and in Bristol Bay off the southern coast of Alaska, west of the Alaska Peninsula. In the spring and fall, walruses congregate throughout the Bering Strait, reaching from the western coast of Alaska to the Gulf of Anadyr. They winter over in the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> along the eastern coast of Siberia south to the northern part of the Kamchatka Peninsula, and along the southern coast of Alaska. A 28,000-year-old fossil walrus was dredged up from the bottom of San Francisco Bay, indicating Pacific walruses ranged that far south during the last ice age. There were roughly 200,000 Pacific walruses according to the most recent (1990) census-based estimate.|$|E
5|$|The total {{historical}} North Pacific {{population was}} estimated at 42,000 to 45,000 {{before the start of}} whaling. Of this, the population in the eastern portion of the North Pacific was estimated to be 25,000 to 27,000. By 1975, the estimate had declined to between 8,000 and 16,000. Surveys conducted in 1991, 1993, 1996, and 2001 produced estimates between 1,600 and 3,200 off California and 280 and 380 off Oregon and Washington. The minimum estimate for the California-Oregon-Washington population, as defined in the U.S. Pacific Marine Mammal Stock Assessments: 2005, is about 2,500. Surveys in coastal waters of British Columbia in summers 2004 and 2005 produced abundance estimates of approximately 500 animals. Surveys near the Pribilof Islands in the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> indicated a substantial increase in the local abundance of fin whales between 1975–1978 and 1987–1989. In 1984, the entire population was estimated to be less than 38% of its historic carrying capacity. Fin whales might have started returning to the coastal waters off British Columbia (a sighting occurred in Johnstone Strait in 2011) and Kodiak Island. Size of the local population migrating to Hawaiian Archipelago is unknown. Historically, several other wintering grounds were scattered in the North Pacific in the past, such as off the Northern Mariana Islands, Bonin Islands, and Ryukyu Islands (for other possible habitats, see blue whale as their habitat preferences may correspond). There was a sighting of 3 animals nearby Borneo and Palawan in 1999.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Islands ecoregion: Five major islands (St. Lawrence, Nunivak, St. Matthew, {{and the two}} Pribilof Islands of the St. Paul and St. George) {{and their}} {{adjacent}} islets dot the inner shelf of the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> and constitute the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Islands ecoregion. Central Yup'ik and Siberian Yupik people settled the larger islands closer to the Alaska mainland.|$|E
25|$|Chapman {{spent her}} {{first four years}} {{operating}} in the North Pacific Ocean and <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> {{on a variety of}} projects in support of NMFSs Northwest Fisheries Science Center and Alaska Fisheries Science Center. She conducted a survey of the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> king crab population each summer which was used to set king crab catch quotas for the following autumn.|$|E

25|$|The Pacific halibut {{is found}} on the {{continental}} shelf of the North Pacific Ocean and <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> Fishing for the Pacific halibut is mostly concentrated in the Gulf of Alaska and the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea,</b> off {{the west coast of}} Canada. Small halibut catches are reported in coastal Washington, Oregon, and California. Pacific halibut is broken up into 10 regularity management areas.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, {{tensions}} {{were high}} between the U.S. and Canada when the U.S. banned Canadians {{from engaging in}} the seal hunt in the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> {{as part of the}} ongoing <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Dispute between the U.S. and Britain. Tupper traveled to Washington, D.C. to represent Canadian interests during the negotiations and was something of an embarrassment to the British diplomats.|$|E

25|$|Though the North Pacific right whale's {{distribution}} is usually more temperate {{than that of}} the more polar Bowhead whale, there are several records of the two species inhabiting the northeastern Sea of Okhotsk at the same time. E. japonica's summer distribution extends north into the southeastern part of the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> In summer, the Bowhead migrates north through the Bering Straits and is in the Chukchi Sea and Beaufort Sea. In winter, the ice-loving Bowhead moves south into the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea,</b> but the right whales have migrated further south of the Aleutian Islands into the North Pacific.|$|E
25|$|The island's {{abundance}} of seabirds and marine mammals is {{due largely to}} the influence of the Anadyr Current, an ocean current which brings cold, nutrient-rich water from the deep waters of the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> shelf edge.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimated}} {{total catch}} in the fishery in the Gulf of Alaska, <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea,</b> North Pacific and Sea of Okhotsk was 26,500–37,000 right whales between 1839 and 1909. Eighty percent of this catch was concentrated in the single decade of 1840–49.|$|E
25|$|Tallapoosa {{departed}} Juneau on 13 April 1931 for Dixon Entrance on <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Patrol duty. The {{next few}} years were spent doing sealing patrols and treaty enforcement in Alaskan waters, with occasional trips to Seattle, Washington, for drydocking and repair.|$|E

25|$|After the {{cessation}} of hostilities with Spain, Manning returned to the operational control of the Revenue Cutter Service. Her patrol duties took her along both the East Coast from Boston to Key West and included a patrol to Cuba and Puerto Rico. On 2 January 1900 Manning was ordered report to San Francisco {{by way of the}} Straits of Magellan for duties with the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> Patrol. During the years of 1900 through 1916 she patrolled the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> enforcing sealing treaties to prevent pelagic sealing and performing search and rescue duties, missing only the years 1904, 1906 and 1908. On her first <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> cruise in 1900, Manning conducted hydrographic surveys as well as sealing patrols. She also rescued the passengers of the stranded barkentine Leslie D that was wrecked on Nunivak Island. On 6 September 1903 the passengers and crew of the schooner Abbie M. Deering that was wrecked on Baby Island were delivered safely to Unalaska by Manning. Later the same day, the crew was called upon by Captain Michael Healy of the USRC Thetis to assist in fighting a fire on the American ship St. Francis {{on the opposite side of}} the wharf from Thetis. In 1904 she performed patrol duties along the West Coast. During the 1905 <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea</b> cruise, the crew of Manning distributed boxes of clothing to natives of Attu and Atka that were provided by the Women's National Relief Association and during a second trip delivered more boxes of clothes donated by a Seattle, Washington hardware store to a warehouse at Dutch Harbor so that other cutters on the patrol could deliver them to other settlements. On 13 December 1905 Manning was assigned patrol duties in Hawaii where she remained until 8 May 1907 when she departed for the <b>Bering</b> <b>Sea.</b> Patrol work was cut short during the 1907 season when Manning struck an uncharted rock in Prince William Sound 15 August. Temporary repairs were made and she made for Bremerton Navy Yard for drydocking and permanent repairs in September. During 1908 Manning patrolled the Pacific Coast and assisted in several search and rescue cases.|$|E
