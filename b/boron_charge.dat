40|$|The role {{of boron}} {{atoms in the}} {{formation}} of the electronic structure of Fe–B-based amorphous metallic alloys (AMA) has been analyzed. In particular, the problem of the <b>boron</b> <b>charge</b> state has been considered. The energy dependence of the density of electronic states has been calculated for the model systems corresponding to the amorphous Fe and AMA Fe 80 B 20 using the LMTO method. The main contribution to the density of electronic states in the vicinity of the Fermi level is shown to be determined by 3 d-electrons of iron. The doping with boron leads to the splitting of the 3 d-peak into bound and antibound subbands, which places the Fermi level within the pseudogap between these subbands. This reduces the density of electronic states at the Fermi level that is in agreement with the Nagel-Tauc criterion of the amorphous state stability. The performed calculation and the experimental X-ray emission spectra prove that boron atoms are the electron acceptors in the Fe-based AMAs...|$|E

5|$|The boron {{nitrides}} are {{notable for}} {{the variety of}} structures that they adopt. They exhibit structures analogous to various allotropes of carbon, including graphite, diamond, and nanotubes. In the diamond-like structure, called cubic boron nitride (tradename Borazon), boron atoms exist in the tetrahedral structure of carbons atoms in diamond, but one in every four B-N bonds {{can be viewed as}} a coordinate covalent bond, wherein two electrons are donated by the nitrogen atom which acts as the Lewis base to a bond to the Lewis acidic boron(III) centre. Cubic boron nitride, among other applications, is used as an abrasive, as it has a hardness comparable with diamond (the two substances are able to produce scratches on each other). In the BN compound analogue of graphite, hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), the positively <b>charged</b> <b>boron</b> and negatively <b>charged</b> nitrogen atoms in each plane lie adjacent to the oppositely charged atom in the next plane. Consequently, graphite and h-BN have very different properties, although both are lubricants, as these planes slip past each other easily. However, h-BN is a relatively poor electrical and thermal conductor in the planar directions.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} for making metal ions for cyclotrons is described. Metal and non-metal ions from solids are produced in a Penning ion source {{by a process}} that involves ions that are unable to cross the first acceleration gap between the ion source and dee and are accelerated back into the ion source where they sputter charge material into the arc. This material is ionized and extracted from the ion source and accelerated. This technique was used for a large variety of ions, both metal and non-metal, including aluminum from the metal and boron from <b>boron</b> nitride <b>charge</b> materials. The efficiency for making iron ions with different ion support gases was calculated, and these results were experimentally checked. A dual ion source is being designed for a dc Penning ion source test stand which makes an excellent source for producing ions from solids for dc extracted Penning ion sources. (auth...|$|R
40|$|We studied lateral silicon p-i-n junctions, doped with {{phosphorus}} and <b>boron,</b> regarding <b>charge</b> sensing feasibility. In {{order to}} examine the detection capabilities and underlying mechanism, we used in a complementary way two measurement techniques. First, we employed a semiconductor parameter analyzer to measure I−V characteristics at a low temperature, for reverse and forward bias conditions. In both regimes, we systematically detected Random Telegraph Signal. Secondly, using a Low Temperature Kelvin Probe Force Microscope, we measured surface electronic potentials. Both p-i-n junction interfaces, p-i and i-n, were observed as regions of a dynamic behaviour, with characteristic time-dependent electronic potential fluctuations. Those fluctuations are due to single charge capture/emission events. We found analytically that the obtained data {{could be explained by}} a model of two-dimensional p-n junction and phosphorus-boron interaction at the edge of depletion region. The results of complementary measurements and analysis presented in this research, supported also by the previous reports, provide fundamental insight into the charge sensing mechanism utilizing emergence of individual dopants...|$|R
40|$|Heavily boron-doped {{polycrystalline}} silicon {{has been reported}} to be characterized by somewhat unexpectedly high power factor. High Seebeck coefficients are however unexpected in materials with high carrier densities. A semi-quantitative model was proposed, showing that the potential barrier structure at grain boundaries, along with the nanometric grain size, leads to an unusual mechanism of carrier filtering, named adiabatic energy filtering. Actually, the presence of potential barriers associated with segregated <b>boron</b> disables <b>charge</b> transport by holes in the band deep tail. This leads to a decrease of the actual carrier density, {{as in the case of}} standard energy filtering. However, the nanometric grain size along with the inefficiency of the hole-hole relaxation mechanism in degenerate semiconductors actually prevents carriers from relaxing, causing an increase of the average (macroscopic) drift mobility. Thus, in spite of the decrease of drifting hole density the electrical conductivity is found to increase. In this communication a refinement of the model is presented, that will be discussed and corroborated with an extended body of experimental data gathered by several authors on degenerate {{polycrystalline silicon}} films...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{presents a}} computational account of strong and exothermic interaction of atomic and molecular oxygen with the α(001) B 12 surface of boron. Physisorbed oxygen interacts weakly with the surface, but the dissociative chemisorption entails considerable exothermicity {{in the range}} of 2. 47 - 3. 45 eV, depending on the adsorbed sites of the two oxygen atoms. Nonetheless, rupture of dioxygen on the surface involves a sizable intrinsic reaction barrier of 3. 40 eV (at 0 K). Such high amount of energy clearly explains the chemical inertness (i. e., the lack of oxidation) of boron at room temperature. However, elevated temperature encountered in real applications of boron, such as cutting machinery, overcomes the high-energy barrier for the dissociative adsorption of molecular oxygen (3. 40 eV). A stability T-P phase diagram reveals the spontaneous nature of the substitutional O/α(001) B 12 adsorption modes that lead to the formation of diboron trioxide (B₂O₃) at temperatures and pressure pertinent to practical applications. This finding conclusively collaborates the experimental observation of the formation of the B₂O₃ phase from adsorption of oxygen on <b>boron.</b> Finally, <b>charge</b> analysis provides an atomic-scale probe for the predicted stability ordering of the considered O/α(001) B 12 configurations...|$|R

40|$|Expressions for dependences of the pre-exponential factor σ_ 3 and {{the thermal}} {{activation}} energy ϵ_ 3 of hopping electric conductivity of holes via boron atoms on the boron atom concentration N and the compensation ratio K are {{obtained in the}} quasiclassical approximation. It is assumed that the acceptors (<b>boron</b> atoms) in <b>charge</b> states (0) and (- 1) and the donors that compensate them in the charge state (+ 1) form a nonstoichiometric simple cubic lattice with translational period R_h = [(1 + K) N]^- 1 / 3 within the crystalline matrix. A hopping event occurs only over the distance R_h at a thermally activated accidental coincidence of the acceptor levels in charge states (0) and (- 1). Donors block the fraction K/(1 - K) of impurity lattice sites. The hole hopping conductivity is averaged over all possible orientations of the lattice {{with respect to the}} external electric field direction. It is supposed that an acceptor band is formed by Gaussian fluctuations of the potential energy of <b>boron</b> atoms in <b>charge</b> state (- 1) due to Coulomb interaction only between the ions at distance R_h. The shift of the acceptor band towards the top of the valence band with increasing N due to screening (in the Debye [...] Hückel approximation) of the impurity ions by holes hopping via acceptor states was taken into account.

It is well recognized that metastable defect complexes are formed in silicon crystals, especially, in p-type silicon.

This drawback may be overcome by activation of belite by doping. Here, the doping mechanism of B and Na/B in belites is reported. For B-doping, three solid solutions have been tested: Ca 2 -x/ 2 □x/ 2 (SiO 4) 1 -x(BO 3) x, Ca 2 (SiO 4) 1 -x(BO 3) xOx/ 2 and Ca 2 -xBx(SiO 4) 1 -x(BO 4) x. The experimental results support the substitution of silicate groups by tetrahedral borate groups with the concomitant substitution of calcium by <b>boron</b> for <b>charge</b> compensation, Ca 2 -xBx(SiO 4) 1 -x(BO 4) x. Otherwise, the coupled Na/B-doping of belite has also been investigated and Ca 2 -xNax(SiO 4) 1 -x(BO 3) x series is confirmed to exist for a large range of x values. Along this series, α'H-C 2 S is the main phase (for x≥ 0. 10) and is single phase for x= 0. 25.

The ultra narrow (3, 3) and (5, 0) boron nitride nanotubes of same diameter but of different chirality have been used. Both of them show hydrogen storage greater than 8 % by weight. Density of states have been calculated, and {{it is found that}} the presence of alpha density of state of potassium results in smaller energy gap; as a result of which, the conductivity of the potassium-decorated boron nitride nanotubes is enhanced as compared to pristine <b>boron</b> nitride nanotubes. <b>Charge</b> decomposition analysis showed that there is significant transfer of charge from adsorbate potassium to boron nitride nanotubes; the same is also confirmed by Mulliken population analysis.

40|$|The work of Banyard and Shull on {{a series}} of two-electron pseudomolecular ions ZHZ+ 2 Z- 1 has been {{extended}} to four electron systems of the form ZHZH+ 2 Z- 2. These systems may be regarded as an approximate representation of a fragment of a more complex molecule, therefore, noninteger Z values were used in an attempt to make some allowance for the nuclear shielding caused by the presence of other electrons which were otherwise unaccounted for in the calculations. The effective nuclear charge Z was allowed to take values of 1. 0, 1. 2, 1. 4, 1. 8 and 2. 2 and the optimum bond angle ZHZ was studied as a function of Z. Within a limited basis set of Slater-type 1 s orbitals, the calculations were complete configuration interaction treatments. The C. I. wave functions were reformulated in terms of natural spin orbitals. Consequently, changes in the electron density distributions have been investigated as a function of Z and bond angle. For Z = 1. 0, 1. 4, 1. 8 and 2. 2, and ZHZ = 100 ° and 120 °, the electron densities of the ZHZH+ 2 Z- 2 ion have been compared with those of the ZHZ+ 2 Z- 1 systems. The nuclear framework of the diborane "bridge" was adopted for a second series of four-centre, four-electron calculations: a similar investigation has been carried out by Hamilton. Once again an allowance was made for nuclear shielding by using effective nuclear <b>charges</b> - the <b>boron</b> nuclear <b>charge,</b> BZ, was given values of 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0.

40|$|The salient {{feature of}} a {{supercapacitor}} {{is its ability}} to deliver much higher power density than a battery. A hierarchical design and a cost-effective approach to fabricate high performance supercapacitors using functional carbon nano-particles is reported. A special arc synthesis method is used to produce amorphous/crystalline composite with nitrogen and <b>boron</b> co-doped high <b>charge</b> density carbon nanoparticles. Upon etch removal of the amorphous phase in the composite nanoparticle, a crystalline carbon framework emerges, consisting of a mixture of nano-graphitic sheets mostly in the middle and single nanohorns distributed around the surface of the nanoparticle. These nanoparticles have large internal/external surfaces with subnano channels and sharp nano-tips for high speed charge transport and local charge accumulation. To deliver high power density, the internal resistance of the device is reduced by assembling the nanoparticles via electro-spraying and compacting them into dense films (without any binder) under 700 MPa of pressure before supercapacitor assembly. Taken together, the hierarchical processed supercapacitor has a very high (compared to literature values) power density of nearly 4. 5 kW cm− 3 and a respectable energy density of 2. 45 mWh cm− 3. Combining these carbon nanoparticles with large area spraying coating, it can lead to a cost-effective production of high performance supercapacitors...|$|R
40|$|Attention {{has been}} {{directed}} toward electron deficient boron- doping in carbon dots (CDs) with the expectation of revealing new photophysical-aspects in accordance with varying amounts of boron content. It has been emphatically shown that boron uptake in CDs varies with different boron precursors evolving altered emissive CDs. Boron doping in CDs causes definite sulfate defect due to the generation of electron-deficient states. Modified hydrothermal treatment of a Mixture of ascorbic acid (AA) and different boron pecurs 6 t compounds (borax/boric acid/sodium borate/sodium- borohydride) produces different kinds of boron-clOped CDs (BCDs). These BCDs (< 6 nm) differ in size, emission maxima (similar to 1. 5 nm), and fluorescence intensity but carry unchanged excitation maxima (365 nm); These, differences are related to:the nature of boron precursor compounds. The most fluorescing BCD (quantum yield approximate to 5 %) is identified from, the borax-mediated reaction and-is used {{for the detection of}} Fe(LII) on a nanomolar level in water via the fluorescence,''Turn Off'' phenomenon. Again, Fe(III) -infested CD solution regains its lost fluorescence, with AA paving the way for nanomolar level AA detection from the same pot. The proposed method has been tactfully made interference free for the quantitative measure of Fe(III) and AA in real samples. Furthermore, new photophysical properties of the CDs with variable boron contents supplement inforMation that is hitherto unknown. Theoretical calculations also-justify the observed optical behavior of the as-synthesizedBCDs.

40|$|MgB(p nσ p nπ) 2 is {{classified}} as a system with strongly interacting σ-electrons and non-correlated π-electrons of boron ions. The kinematic and Coulomb interaction V between the orbitally degenerated σ-electrons provide the superconducting state with an anisotropic gap of s*-wave symmetry. The critical temperature Tc has a non-monotonic dependence on the distance r between the centers of gravity of σ- and π-bands. MgB 2 corresponds to r = 0. 085 eV and V = 0. 45 eV in our model with flat bands. The derived superconducting density of electronic states is in good agreement with available experimental and theoretical data. The possibilities for increasing Tc are discussed. Keywords: A. Superconductors; C. Crystal structure and symmetry; D. Electronic band structure; D. Electron correlations The unprecedented discovery of superconductivity in the simple binary material MgB 2 [1] has opened up new avenues to attack the problem of maximizing Tc and the symmetry of the order parameter. In the present paper we present a model to explain the superconducting state in MgB 2 {{which is based on}} the correlated σ- and the non-correlated π-band. The negatively <b>charged</b> <b>boron</b> layers and the positively charged magnesium layers provide a lowering of the π-band with respect to the σ-band, as pointed out in Ref. [2] and which was also noticed first in band calculations [3, 4, 5]. Tight-binding estimates show that the bonding σ-band, close to the Fermi level, is doubly degenerate (it has E-symmetry [6, 7]). The quasi- 2 D σ-electrons are more localized than the 3 D π-electrons. This leads to an enhancement of the on-site electron correlations in the system of degenerated σ-electrons. They are taken to be infinite, while the somewhat weaker intersite Coulomb interactions and electron-phonon interactions simply shift the on-site electron energies.

40|$|Since {{tuberculosis}} incidence {{has been}} increasing world-wide due, in part, to infection from drug-resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, {{there is a need}} for new, more effective drugs for treatment (Bloom and Murray 1992). To this end, the strategies of medicinal chemistry were applied this problem and a group of 22 small organic molecules were prepared as inhibitors of mycobacterial growth. The group is comprised of pyridines and pyrazines, boronic acids and esters, and diazaborines. The 10 pyridine and pyrazine compounds are composed of 5 pyridine derivatives (3 PYSO, 4 PYSO, 3 PYS, 4 PYS, 3 PYA) including 3 unreported (3 PYS, 4 PYS, 3 PYA), and 5 pyrazine derivatives (PZSO, PZS, POAH, PZUREA, PZCS) including 2 unreported (PZUREA, PZCS). These 10 compounds have a rationale for antimycobacterial activity that involves mycobacterial penetration, then bioactivation by enzyme systems known to exists in mycobacteria to metabolites expected to be toxic to the organism. The 6 boronic acids and esters are composed of 3 boronic acids (3 PYB, 4 PYB, NPBA) and 3 boronic acid esters (NPOB, DEPYB, BDPYB), with BDPYB unreported. The compounds were expected to have antimycobacterial activity due to the ability of <b>boron</b> to form <b>charged,</b> reversible tetrahedral complexes and compete for enzyme active-sites. Since diazaborines were shown to inhibit bacterial growth by a novel mechanism, 6 benzodiazaborines were also synthesized, composed of 2 [2, 3, 1] -benzo-e-diazaborines (SDZB, PDZB) and 4 new [2, 4, 1] -benzo-e-diazaborines (OBDZB, OPDZB, TPDZB, PZDZB; Baldock, Rafferty et al. 1996). In order to prepare aza-analogs of ASDZB and APDZB, a lesser-known synthetic strategy relying on a dilithiated intermediate was used in an attempt of their preparation as well its successful application for SDZB and PDZB (Sharp and Skinner 1986). All of the compounds were then evaluated in vitro for growth inhibition of wild-type M. tuberculosis H₃₇Rᵥ by Dr. Scott G. Franzblau at LSU. Of the compounds tested, the diazaborines were the most active, although much less than one of the best available drugs, isoniazid.
