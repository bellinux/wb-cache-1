Between 300,000 and 500,000 people visited the Ellipse to see the exhibits and performances (with bumper-to-bumper traffic on nearby streets as people drove <b>by</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the trees), and the pageant proved so popular that it was extended for two days.|$|E

2500|$|The whole-word contractions of {{the fifth}} decade are [...] be, [...] enough, [...] to, [...] were, [...] his, [...] in, [...] by/was. If one of these words occurs {{at the end of}} a sentence, or before a comma, it must be spelled out (though [...] "enough" [...] would still be {{partially}} contracted to en-ou-gh.) They cannot even be used in hyphenated words such as bride-to-be. However, much like Arabic prepositions, the prepositions , , and [...] join with a following word without an intervening space. This prevents [...] from being read as 'was'. That is, in He came <b>by</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> us, [...] "by to see" [...] is written as one word, [...] [...] Word-joining is allowed as long as the upper half of the braille cell (dot 1 or 4) is used in the final word; to, by, into do join with in, enough, be, his, was, were, but the second word is spelled out.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Buckley {{attracted}} admiring crowds and attention from record label executives. Industry maven Clive Davis even dropped <b>by</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him. By the summer of 1992, limos from executives eager to sign the singer lined the street outside Sin-é. Buckley signed with Columbia Records, home of Bob Dylan and Bruce Springsteen, for a three-album, essentially million-dollar deal in October 1992. [...] Buckley spent three days in February 1993 {{in the studio with}} engineer Steve Addabbo and Columbia A man, Steve Berkowitz, recording much of Buckley's solo repertoire. Buckley sang a cappella and also accompanied himself on acoustic and electric guitars, Wurlitzer electric piano, and harmonium. These tapes remain unreleased in the Columbia vaults, but much of this material later surfaced on the Grace album. [...] Recording dates were set for July and August 1993 for what would become Buckley's recording debut, an EP of four songs which included a cover of Van Morrison's [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do". Live at Sin-é was released on November 23, 1993, documenting this period of Buckley's life.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years, Bader made himself a thorn {{in the side of}} the Germans. He often practised what the RAF {{personnel}} called [...] "goon-baiting". He considered it his duty to cause as much trouble to the enemy as possible, much of which included escape attempts. He made so many escape attempts that the Germans threatened to take away his legs. In August 1942, Bader escaped with Johnny Palmer and three others from the camp at Stalag Luft III B in Sagan. Unluckily, a Luftwaffe officer of Jagdgeschwader 26 was in the area. Keen to meet the Tangmere wing leader, he dropped <b>by</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Bader, but when he knocked on his door, there was no answer. Soon the alarm was raised, and a few days later, Bader was recaptured. During the escape attempt, the Germans produced a poster of Bader and Palmer asking for information. It described Bader's disability and said he [...] "walks well with stick". Twenty years later, Bader was sent a copy of it by a Belgian civilian prisoner, who had worked in a Gestapo office in Leipzig. Bader found this amusing, as he had never used a stick. He was finally dispatched to the [...] "escape-proof" [...] Colditz Castle Oflag IV-C on 18 August 1942, where he remained until 15 April 1945 when it was liberated by the First United States Army.|$|E
