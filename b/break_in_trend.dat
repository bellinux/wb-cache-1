40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{consider}} the issue of testing a time series for a unit root in the possible presence of a break in a linear deterministic trend at some unknown point in the series. We propose a break fraction estimator which, {{in the presence of}} a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>trend,</b> is consistent for the true break fraction at rate Op(T^- 1) when there is either a unit root or near-unit root in the stochastic component of the series.

We compare observed values with predictions made by a deterministic components model, the Holt-Winters exponential smoothing filter, an ARIMA model and a structural time series model.

HHLT's analysis hinges on a new break fraction estimator which, when a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>trend</b> occurs, is consistent for the true break fraction at rate Op(T?? 1). Unlike other available estimators, however, {{when there is no}} trend break HHLT's estimator converges to zero at rate Op(T 1 = 2). In their analysis HHLT assume the shocks to follow a linear process driven by IID innovations. Our first contribution is to show that HHLT's break fraction estimator retains the same consistency properties as demonstrated by HHLT for the IID case when the innovations display non-stationary behaviour of a quite general form, in- cluding, for example, the case of a single break in the volatility of the innovations {{which may or may not}} occur at the same time as a <b>break</b> <b>in</b> <b>trend.</b> However, as we subsequently demonstrate, the limiting null distribution of unit root statistics based around this es- timator are not pivotal in the presence of non-stationary volatility. Associated Monte Carlo evidence is presented to quantify the impact of various models of non-stationary volatility on both the asymptotic and finite sample behaviour of such tests. A solution to the identified inference problem is then provided by considering wild bootstrap-based implementations of the HHLT tests, using the trend break estimator from the original sample data. The proposed bootstrap method does not require the practitioner to specify a parametric model for volatility, and is shown to perform very well in practice across a range of models.
