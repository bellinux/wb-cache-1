5|$|HDR {{brachytherapy}} for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, such as <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma and {{squamous cell}} carcinoma, provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause disfigurement or require extensive reconstruction. Various applicators {{can be used}} to ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of the skin and help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} differential diagnosis in gout is septic arthritis. This {{should be considered}} in those with signs of infection or those who do not improve with treatment. To help with diagnosis, a synovial fluid Gram stain and culture may be performed. Other conditions that can look similar include pseudogout, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, and reactive arthritis. Gouty tophi, in particular when not located in a joint, can be mistaken for <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> carcinoma or other neoplasms.|$|E
5|$|The {{wings are}} {{transparent}} with black or brown veins and a brown-black patch {{at the base}} of apical cells 2 and 3. These patches are sometimes fused into a continuous zigzag of dark brown to black discolouration. The <b>basal</b> <b>cell</b> is often opaque and amber-coloured. As on many insects, the wing membranes are coated on either side by a repeating pattern of cuticular nanostructures, about 200nm in height, separated by about 180nm.

The cell linage relationship between these two epithelial types is not clear. Here we demonstrate that luminal cells can develop independently of <b>basal</b> <b>cells,</b> but that <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> are essential for maintaining ductal integrity and the proper differentiation of luminal cells. Urogenital sinus (UGS) isolated from p 63 (+/+) and p 63 (-/-) embryos developed into prostate when grafted into adult male nude mice. Prostatic tissue that developed in p 63 (-/-) UGS grafts contained neuroendocrine and luminal <b>cells,</b> but <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> were absent. Therefore, p 63 is essential for differentiation of <b>basal</b> <b>cells,</b> but p 63 and thus <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> are not required for differentiation of prostatic neuroendocrine and luminal epithelial cells. p 63 (-/-) prostatic grafts also contained atypical mucinous; cells, which appeared to differentiate from luminal cells via activation of Src. In the response to castration, regression of p 63 (-/-) prostate was inordinately severe with almost complete loss of ducts, resulting {{in the formation of}} residual cystic structures devoid of epithelium. Therefore, <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> play critical roles in maintaining ductal integrity and survival of luminal cells. However, regressed p 63 (-/-) prostate did regenerate in response to androgen administration, indicating that <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> were not essential for prostatic regeneration...|$|R

40|$|Necturus {{taste buds}} contain {{two types of}} basal cells: {{presumptive}} stem <b>cells</b> and Merkel-like <b>basal</b> <b>cells.</b> Both types of <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> are small round cells located {{at the base of}} the taste bud, indistinguishable from each other with light microscopy.

40|$|Merkel-like <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> in {{the taste}} buds of the frog were {{examined}} by fluorescence histochemistry, immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. There were about 16 – 20 <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> {{arranged in a}} radial fashion {{at the base of}} each taste bud. These cells were strongly immunopositive for serotonin antiserum. They were characterised by the presence of numerous dense-cored granules in the cytoplasm ranging from 80 to 120 nm in diameter, and of microvilli protruding from the cell surface. For 4 mo after sensory denervation by cutting the gustatory nerves, all cell types of the taste bud were well preserved and maintained their fine structure. Even at 4 mo after denervation, the <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited a strong immunoreaction with serotonin antiserum. To investigate the function of serotonin in the <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> in taste bud function, serotonin deficiency was induced by administration of p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA), an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase, and of p-chloroamphetamine (PCA), a depletor of serotonin. After administration of these agents to normal and denervated frogs for 2 wk, a marked decrease, or complete absence, of immunoreactivity for serotonin was observed in the <b>basal</b> <b>cells.</b> Ultrastructurally, degenerative changes were observed in both types of frog; numerous lysosome-like myelin bodies were found in all cell types of the taste buds.

25|$|Particularly, ngn2 is also {{important}} to regulate the transition of cortical progenitors from the ventricular zone to the subventricular zone.

The specification of different neuronal subtypes depends on the group of proneural genes involved. Low levels of proneural transcripts in ventricular zone are expressed when progenitor’s specification occurs and an increase in their expression results in the beginning of neurogenesis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Epithelial {{shedding}} {{processes in}} airway inflammation and defence may produce damaged areas where <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> {{are the main}} remaining epithelial cell type. The present study examines the capacity of <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> to form an epithelial barrier structure after loss of columnar epithelial cells. METHODS: A technique was developed which allows selective removal of columnar epithelial cells from isolated airways. A drop of tissue adhesive glue was applied on the mucosal surface shortly after excision of guinea pig trachea and human bronchus. Gentle removal of the glue, together with attached columnar cells, left a single layer of cobbled, solitary <b>basal</b> <b>cells.</b> The tissue was kept in culture media. Morphological changes of the <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> were monitored by immuno-histochemistry and scanning and transmission electron microscopy at several time points. RESULTS: After 20 minutes the <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> had undergone extensive flattening and established contact with each other. The basement membrane thus became covered by a poorly differentiated epithelium in both guinea pig and human airways. Abundant interdigitating cytoplasmic protrusions were observed at <b>cell</b> borders. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Basal</b> <b>cells</b> promptly flatten out to cover the basement membrane at loss of neighbouring columnar cells. These data may explain why the epithelial barrier function may be uncompromised in desquamative airway diseases. Furthermore, they suggest the possibility that sacrificial release of columnar epithelial cells and prompt creation of a barrier structure constitute important roles of <b>basal</b> <b>cells</b> in airway defence against severe insults. ...|$|R
