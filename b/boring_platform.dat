2500|$|The Dutch {{magazine}} Power Unlimited {{rated the}} Game Gear version 70/100, noting that it [...] "consists partly of <b>boring</b> <b>platform</b> worlds" [...] that are [...] "not really worth the effort". They added, however, that [...] "fortunately, {{there are also}} some simple puzzle games that are fun" [...] and keep the game above mediocrity. A Game Players review gave the Game Gear version a 62/100 rating. The magazine wrote that [...] "the twisted humor of other Simpsons games isn't there and the action segments could be from any game. Ignore it for home, but pack it for the beach." ...|$|E
5000|$|Reviewing the Saturn version, Sam Hickman of Sega Saturn Magazine called Johnny Bazookatone [...] "three hundred {{hours of}} the most <b>boring</b> <b>platform</b> action ever invented", citing blurry sprites, enemies which are {{persistently}} annoying rather than challenging, and the game's generally outdated look and feel. Scary Larry of GamePro commented on the game's irritating difficulty, particularly executing the crucial Shooting Float move, but was delighted with the rendered sprites, backgrounds, and music, and concluded, [...] "Fans looking for a humorous cross between Earthworm Jim and Donkey Kong Country should check out Johnny." [...] A reviewer for Next Generation opined that while the gameplay mechanics are generic, the level design is clever and the graphics are genuinely next generation. He summarized, [...] "While it's tempting to swear-off the side-scrolling action game as a by-gone producet of the 16-bit era, there's something devilishly tempting about a game that looks and plays as good as Johnny Bazookatone." [...] Maximum regarded the Saturn version as unfavorably as the PlayStation version, lambasting it for its [...] "hideously dated" [...] story concept, overly small sprites, last generation graphics, lack of intelligent design to the levels or enemies, and frustrating puzzles.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a drilling method, which might prove useful both for applications on the Moon and for drilling on Mars, Venus, or other planetary surfaces. It {{is based on}} the use of a cold gas flow for pumping fine-grained debris particles out of the borehole, after they have been pulverized by the bore crown. We present a basic design and demonstrate by a hydrodynamic calculation that such a system should work effectively even on an airless body like the Moon, where the driver gas has to be provided from the associated lander or rover, which acts as the <b>bore</b> <b>platform.</b> Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|A seismic and {{sequence}} stratigraphic {{investigation of the}} Rio Grande system provides information conceming: (1) the distribution of depositional units relative to the last glacio-eustatic cycle (120, 000 ybp to present); (2) the spatial and temporal distribution of sand-prone units; and (3) whether the control of eustasy and sediment supply (climate) on deposition can be differentiated. The combination of biostratigraphic data (foraminiferal abundances and extinctions), oxygen isotope stratigraphy, and radiocarbon ages in the Rio Grande area provides the chronologic control for the study. The depositional unit dataset consists of 1850 kilometers of high-resolution seismic reflection profiles, 14 <b>platform</b> <b>boring</b> descriptions, and sediment samples from one <b>platform</b> <b>boring.</b> The study of the Rio Grande system indicates the following: (1) transgressive system tract units are primarily prograding deltas rather than back stepping fine grained units, as predicted by basic sequence stratigraphic theory; (2) fluvial- and wave-dominated delta systems exist simultaneously (geologically-speaking) creating difficulties in the prediction of reservoir distribution and quality; and (3) eustatic and climatic control on unit deposition can be differentiated, and the quantity of sediment supply coincides {{with the amount of}} moisture in the drainage area...|$|R
40|$|A {{discussion}} is presented {{of the design}} and testing of remedial measures {{that can be taken}} to achieve reasonable nutation damping of the Galileo spacecraft in the event of failure of its boom damper in flight. One scheme exploits the effects of payload motion on the nutational stability of a spinning spacecraft. However, the spacecraft-motion-compensation algorithm can only be used if the scan <b>platform</b> <b>bore</b> sight is pointed in a direction chosen to produce rapid damping of spacecraft nutation. A second method suggested for nutation damping is a thruster-based open-loop control algorithm, utilizing a pair of thrusters as actuators...|$|R
50|$|During mid-February 1943 the Department of Public Works {{received}} a requisition from the US Army {{for construction of}} a gun firing range, or <b>bore</b> sight range, <b>platform</b> at Charters Towers airfield to test the accuracy of aircraft fixed armament. The work order was lodged with the superintending engineer, Department of Interior, Townsville. The concrete gun firing platform was designed with an adjustable metal plate set {{in front of the}} concrete block to take the nose wheel of aircraft with tricycle undercarriages, such as the B-25. A steel gantry frame with a sling was positioned on the platform to lift the tail of fighter aircraft with tail wheels such as the P-40. The bore sight range extended about 360 metres to an earth mound, or butt, in front of which a target was set.|$|R
40|$|Deltaic {{deposits}} {{were the}} main sinks for sequestering large volumes of sand on the northern Gulf of Mexico continental shelf during the late Quaternary. Examination of high resolution seismic reflection data, cores, and <b>platform</b> <b>boring</b> descriptions allows detailed description and delineation of two sand units on the East Texas shelf. This study determined sand source, depositional setting, and volume of each unit along with an evaluation of sediment supply changes through time. The ancestral Colorado River deposited the two deltaic sand units during a sea-level highstand (Stage 3) and a sea-level rise (Stage 2 to 1). The balance between sediment supply and eustasy controlled the timing and style of delta deposition. Climate changes in the drainage basin have tentatively been correlated with sediment supply changes. Generally, increased supply up-dip correlates with increased yield down-dip, however, other factors, such as floods and floodplain construction, can modify the overall signal...|$|R
40|$|This study {{documents}} {{the evolution of}} the interdeltaic central Texas continental shelf over the last 350, 000 years. The dataset consists of high-resolution seismic data, <b>platform</b> <b>boring</b> descriptions, oxygen isotope analyses, and radiocarbon dates. A strong correlation exists between seismic facies and lithofacies enabling seven stages of evolution to be mapped. The distribution of these facies is primarily controlled by fourth-order glacio-eustatic cycles. Seismic stratigraphy, oxygen isotope analyses, and radiocarbon dating were integrated to develop an independent sea-level curve for the area. Longshore and surface currents transport large volumes of sand into the area which is deposited as widespread, thick $(>$ 10 meters) barrier-bar highstand sand bodies on the inner shelf. Sediments are deposited and preserved in a repetitive manner during each glacio-eustatic cycle. This implies a predictable pattern of deposition, therefore, allowing for the development of depositional models that can be applied to ancient deposits in the exploration for hydrocarbons...|$|R
40|$|A {{fabrication}} {{technique was}} reported earlier [1] to produce high aspect ratio hollow circular cross-sectioned microneedles involving just one lithography step. However, {{the strength of}} those needles was still not tested. Here, the average failure force for each microneedle was measured experimentally. The insertion force in agar gel, {{which serves as a}} reliable human skin equivalent in terms of its visco-elastic properties [2], was obtained. The safety factor, ratio of failure force to insertion force was computed to be almost 600. Therefore, the fabricated microneedles are sufficiently strong to be inserted into the stratum corneum. Further to this, the fabrication process was enhanced to incorporate sharpening of the tips of the microneedles as well as mounting them on a platform such that the bores of the needles are continuous through the <b>bore</b> of the <b>platform</b> on which they are mounted.

40|$|XThis paper {{reports on}} the high {{strength}} of highaspect ratio (> 50) hollow, polymer microneedles fabricated out-of-plane using a fairly repeatable fabrication process. Further, these microneedle tips were sharpened by a molding principle, with a simple anisotropic etch of silicon wafer. Also, an enhanced elegant process was explored to incorporate the mounting of the microneedle onto a platform without using any additional material, such that the bore of the microneedle is continuous with the <b>bore</b> of the <b>platform</b> {{in order to facilitate}} microfluidic delivery through the hollow needles. The high aspect ratio microneedles undergo failure at the critical load of around 4 N, while the insertion force for such a needle into agar gel, which is a fairly good equivalent of the human skin due to its inherent visco-elastic properties, is 7 mN, which translates into a safety factor (ratio of critical loading force to the maximum applied force) of greater than 500 thus, making it adequately strong for skin penetration. status: publishe...|$|R

6000|$|When the Iroquoian Family migrated, the Hurons {{settled in}} the western {{peninsula}} of Ontario. The name of Lake Huron still recalls their abode. But {{a part of the}} race kept moving eastward. Before the coming of the whites, they had fought their way almost to the sea. But they were able to hold their new settlements only by hard fighting. The great stockade which Cartier saw at Hochelaga, with its palisades and fighting <b>platforms,</b> <b>bore</b> witness to the ferocity of the struggle. At that place Cartier and his companions were entertained with gruesome tales of Indian fighting and of wholesale massacres. Seventy years later, in Champlain's time, the Hochelaga stockade had vanished, and the Hurons had been driven back into the interior. But for nearly two centuries after Champlain the Iroquois retained their hold on the territory from Lake Ontario to the Hudson. The conquests and wars of extermination of these savages, and the terror which they inspired, have been summed up by General Francis Walker in the saying: 'They were the scourge of God upon the aborigines of the continent.' ...|$|R
40|$|Ten {{years have}} passed since in 1997 for the first time {{construction}} of bored tunnels in the Netherlands soft soil was undertaken. Before that date essentially only immersed tunnels and cut-and-cover tunnels were constructed in the Netherlands. The first two bored tunnels were Pilot Projects, the 2 nd Heinenoord tunnel and the Botlek Rail tunnel. Since then a series of other bored tunnels has been constructed and some are still under construction today. At the beginning of this period, amongst others Bakker et al(1997), gave an overview of the risks related to bored tunnels in soft ground and a plan for research related to the pilot projects was developed. After that in 1999 the 2 nd Heinenoord tunnel opened for the public, the “Jointed platform for Bored tunnelling”, in short GPB, was organized, to coordinate further research and monitoring of <b>bored</b> tunnels. This <b>platform</b> is supervised by the Center for Underground Construction. In this paper a summary is given {{of some of the most}} characteristic observations on these 10 years of underground construction in the Netherlands. In the first part of this paper the focus is on geotechnical interactions, and stability, whereas part two will focus more on structural related issues.
