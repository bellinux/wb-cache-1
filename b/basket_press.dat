25|$|As {{with many}} Bordeaux estates, the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> {{has come back}} into vogue but with modern {{elements}} such as pneumatic controls. Jean-Claude Berrouet, one of the head winemakers for the Moueix estates helped designed a vertical <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> aimed at more gently handling the pomace {{and this has been}} adopted by several estates.|$|E
25|$|With {{relatively}} modest changes, the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> {{has continued to}} be widely used for centuries since its introduction by both small artisan winemakers to large Champagne houses. In Europe, basket presses with hydraulic machinery can be found throughout Sauternes, Burgundy and parts of Italy.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th and 18th century, {{the style}} of {{winemaking}} in France was for heartier wines that could age and survive long transport voyages over seas. Winemaking text such as the 1803 annotated and updated edition of de Serres' Théâtre d'Agriculture began recommending that all fine producers employ {{the use of a}} wine press and that sometimes blending in a bit of the vin de presse to enhance color and body was essential to create a wine that could last. Even in Bordeaux, which was still using lagars long after Burgundy, Champagne and other French wine regions had adopted the <b>basket</b> <b>press,</b> saw the use of a wine press become more popular after darker, more full bodied wines of Ho-Bryan produced by Lord Arnaud III de Pontac began receive wide acclaim from English writers such as Jonathan Swift, John Locke and Samuel Pepys. By the end of the 18th century, nearly all prestigious Bordeaux wine estates were following de Pontac's method of giving the grapes more time to ferment in the vat and then using a <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> on the darker vin vermeilh and pressing it into new oak barrels.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of modern winemaking, most <b>presses</b> were <b>basket</b> <b>presses</b> made of wood and {{operated}} manually. <b>Basket</b> <b>presses</b> are composed of a cylinder of wooden slats {{on top of a}} fixed plate, with a moveable plate that can be forced downward (usually by a central ratcheting threaded screw.) The press operator would load the grapes or pomace into the wooden cylinder, put the top plate in place and lower it until juice flowed from the wooden slats. As the juice flow decreased, the plate was ratcheted down again. This process continued until the press operator determined that the quality of the pressed juice or wine was below standard, or all liquids had been pressed. Since the early 1990s, modern mechanical <b>basket</b> <b>presses</b> have been revived through higher-end producers seeking to replicate the gentle pressing of the historical <b>basket</b> <b>presses.</b> Because <b>basket</b> <b>presses</b> have a relatively compact design, the press cake offers a relatively longer pathway for the juice to travel before leaving the press. It is believed by advocates of <b>basket</b> <b>presses</b> that this relatively long pathway through the grape or pomace cake serves as a filter to solids that would otherwise affect the quality of the press juice.|$|R

25|$|The {{advancement}} of steam power machinery in the 19th century {{brought about a}} revolution in wine press technology as manual <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> gave way to steam-powered presses that greatly increased the efficiency of pressing and reduced the amount labor needed to operate a press. Even the {{advancement of}} rail transport had a positive influence {{as the cost of}} transporting large wine presses from manufacturers to wine regions throughout the globe decreased and more wineries began being able to afford purchasing a wine press.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greeks and Romans {{developed}} {{large wooden}} wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert {{pressure on the}} pomace. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church. There are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was likely because added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus manual treading was substantial enough to justify the cost.|$|E
25|$|Machine {{pressing}} {{became even}} more widespread in the 17th and 18th century as the style of winemaking in France {{and other parts of}} Europe was shifting towards heartier wines that could age and survive long transport voyages over seas. Winemaking text began recommending the use of mechanical pressings over feet treading in lagars. Even in Bordeaux, which was still using lagars long after Burgundy, Champagne and other French wine regions had adopted the <b>basket</b> <b>press,</b> saw the use of a wine press become more popular after darker, more full bodied wines of Ho-Bryan produced by Lord Arnaud III de Pontac began receive wide acclaim from English writers.|$|E

The grapes are hand {{harvested}} and destemmed {{into a single}} cement vat before being <b>basket</b> <b>pressed</b> directly into new French barriques for 18 months. The wine was inspired by Powell's restaurateur friend Ignatius Chan, proprietor of Iggy's and Yoshiyuki [...] in Singapore.|$|R
25|$|In the Middle Ages, most {{winemaking}} technology advances {{were made}} by religious orders (particularly in France and Germany) who owned vast amounts of vineyard land and produced large quantities of wines in their abbeys and bishoprics. It was here that the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> became popular. The press included large cylindrical basket made of wood staves bound together by wood or metal rings with a heavy horizontal disc fitted at the top. After the grapes were loaded into the basket, the disc would depress towards the bottom with juice seeping out between the staves into a waiting basin or tray. In some presses, added pressure would come from a giant lever or manual hand crank.|$|E
25|$|While the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> was {{becoming}} more widely used by Church owned estates in France and Germany, winemaking in the Iberian peninsula and by small local farmers throughout Europe was still mostly down by treading in stone lagers. However, there are many church records that showed feudal land tenants {{were willing to pay}} a portion of their crop to use a landlord's wine press if it was available. This was probably due in part to added volume of wine (anywhere from 15-20%) that pressing could produce versus treading. But safety could have also been a driving force since many parish records from the period reported wine cellar works suffocating to death (from the released carbon dioxide) while treading fermenting wine grapes in a vat.|$|E
25|$|The {{more modern}} {{idea of a}} piece of a {{winemaking}} equipment used to extract the juice from the skins probably emerged during the Greco-Roman periods where written accounts by Cato the Elder, Marcus Terentius Varro, Pliny the Elder and others described wooden wine presses that utilized large beams, capstans and windlasses to exert pressure on the pomace. The wines produced by these presses were usually darker, with more color extracted from the skins but could also be more harsh with bitter tannins also extracted. That style of wine press would eventually evolve into the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> used in the Middle Ages by wine estates of the nobility and Catholic Church leading to the modern tank batch and continuous presses used in wineries today.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of large, enclosed membrane presses in the 1970s that could more efficiently process larger batches of grapes with acceptable quality of juice encouraged many wineries to transition away from using screw <b>presses.</b> While <b>basket</b> <b>presses</b> are still popular among artisan and small wineries and some high volume producers still utilize continuous screw, {{the most commonly}} used presses in the wine industry tend to be membrane presses.|$|R

2500|$|Wine presses are {{generally}} classified into two types—batch and continuous. Batch presses involve pressing a set amount (a [...] "batch") of grapes {{with the press}} needing to be emptied of the pomace or [...] "cake" [...] (the leftover skins, seeds and stems) between batches. There are many different styles of batch presses ranging from simple hand operated <b>basket</b> <b>presses</b> to computerized membrane presses and presses that are [...] "opened" [...] with oxygen able to {{come into contact with}} the must or [...] "enclosed" [...] in a tank that allows for anaerobic winemaking. Continuous presses use a helical screw (such as an auger) or belt that transports the grapes from a feed in across a cylindrical screen or between air pressured filled pads that presses the grapes, compacts the cakes and then removes the cake through an output all in one continuous operation.|$|R
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} styles of mechanical press, these can range from a simple wooden basket with vertical slats and a capstan providing pressure to large hydraulic presses that can even be enclosed to prevent exposure oxygen. An advantage of this style of press is the usually gentle means that it presses the grape but its disadvantages includes the labor intensiveness of its use, small volumes and tendency to provide uneven pressure to {{all parts of the}} cake as well as usually exposing the must to significant amounts of oxygen. Another disadvantage from a time perspective but an advantage in other regards such as gentleness, is that by its nature pressing with a <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> is very slow. Applying too much pressure too rapidly can break the press.|$|E
2500|$|In the 20th century, wine presses {{advanced}} {{from the}} vertical style pressing of the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> and ancient wine press to horizontal pressing with pressure either being applied at {{one or both}} ends or from the side through use of an airbag or bladder. These new presses were categorize as [...] "batch", which like the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> {{had to have the}} pomace emptied and grapes reloaded, and as [...] "continuous" [...] where a belt or Archimedes' screw would subject the grapes/pomace to increasing pressure {{from one end of the}} press to the other with new grapes being added and the pomace being continuously removed.|$|E

Some advance presses can even be flushed with nitrogen to create a complete anaerobic environment that can be desired for wine making with white wine grapes. Additionally, many of today's modern presses are computerized, which allows the operator to control exactly how much pressure is being applied to the grape skins and for how many cycles.|$|E

5000|$|The Laird is {{a single}} {{vineyard}} wine sourced from Malcolm Seppelt's Gnadenfrei vineyard between Marananga and Seppeltsfield. Planted in 1958, this five acre (two Hectare) site {{is considered to be}} among the finest vineyards in all of the Barossa. Grapes are hand-harvested and immediately brought to the Torbreck winery and gently de-stemmed into wooden & concrete open top fermenters. After being <b>basket</b> <b>pressed</b> into stainless steel until primary fermentation is completed, the wine is moved into French oak barriques from Burgundian winemaker Dominique Laurent. Crafted from wood harvested from Forêt de Tronçais in Allier, the oak trunks were split by hand and then again hand split into staves, producing staves that are almost twice as thick as traditional machine-split staves. These were then aged outdoors for 48 to 54 months before being hand-made into barrels. The Laird is aged for 36 months in its own temperatured controlled stone shed. It is bottled unfined and unfiltered. In Scotland, the lord of the manor is referred to as [...] "The Laird". When the 2005 vintage made its debut at A$700 in 2010, it was the most expensive bottle of wine ever released in Australia [...] The 2005 vintage received a perfect 100 point score from Lisa Perotti-Brown MW in the Dec 2010 issue of The Wine Advocate The 2008 vintage of The Laird also earned a perfect 100-point score from Ms. Perotti Brown in the February, 2013 issue of the Wine Advocate.|$|R
2500|$|This {{press is}} {{essentially}} a <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> that has been turned on it sides with two heads at opposite ends providing more homogenous pressure as it moves horizontally towards the compacting cake. Often these presses have chains connected between the two heads that break up the cake between pressings as the heads are retracted. While less labor-intensive than traditional basket presses and providing more even pressure, one disadvantage of the moving head press is that it that cake gets so compact that {{it is often difficult}} for juice to strain from the inner core of the cake out. This has the effect of creating a dry [...] "outer cake" [...] and wet [...] "inner cake" [...] with trapped juices still inside. The juice extracted from the dry outer cake can also be very coarse and high in phenolics.|$|E
2500|$|In Champagne, where whole-cluster {{pressing}} {{in shallow}} <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> is very common, {{the tradition of}} separating the press fractions dates back to Dom Pérignon with guidelines recorded in 1718 by his biographer Canon Godinot. According to Pérignon (Godinot), the [...] free run vin de goutte was considered too delicate and lacking on its own to make fine Champagne and it was sometimes discarded or used for other wines. The first and second pressings (called tailles or cut since the pomace cake was literally cut with ropes, chains or paddles to remove it between pressings) were the most ideal for sparkling wine production. The juice of the third pressing was considerable acceptable but the fourth pressing (called the vin de taille) was rarely used and all other pressings after that (the vins de pressoirs) were considered too harsh and colored to be of any value in Champagne production.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the use of}} the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> {{became more}} popular, wineries and wine writers started to make a {{distinction}} between the quality of wine that came from different levels of pressing. The highest quality was the vin de goutte or the [...] "free run" [...] juice that was released by the mere weight of the grapes squeezing each other as they were loaded into the press. This was usually the lightest in colour and body and was often kept separate from the vin de presse that came from pressing which was darker and had more tannins. In 1600, French wine writer Olivier de Serres noted in his work Théâtre d'Agriculture that it was a tradition associated only with the wines of Anjou in the Loire Valley to blend in the vin de goutte with the vin de presse. Much like the ancient Roman pressed wine lorca, Middle Age peasants often drank piquette from the left over grape skins after pressing.|$|E

It is produced throughout Abruzzo and Molise, but particularly in the municipality of Montefalcone del Sannio.|$|R
2500|$|By the 2nd century AD, the Romans {{began using}} a [...] "screw press" [...] {{that would be}} the {{predecessor}} to the <b>basket</b> <b>press</b> that would become popular in the Middle Ages. This press would include a large beam with a hole cut out of the middle through which a screw was fitted through. Attached the base of the beam was a cut piece of stone that fit the circumference of a vat that was lined with porous clay or cloth. Ropes and pulleys attached to the beam would raise the beam and stone above the vat that would be loaded with grapes. Then six to eight workers (usually slaves) would be divided {{on either side of the}} screw. The workers would walk clockwise, turning the screw as it the stone descended upon the grapes, providing added pressure with each turn. A hole or spout at the bottom of the vat would allow the juice to drain out where it was usually bucket into amphorae or other large fermentation vessels. A replica of this style Roman screw press still exist at a winery in Beaucaire, Gard in the Languedoc wine region of France.|$|E

60|$|My {{wife and}} I were {{staying at a}} small town in {{northern}} Italy; and on a certain pleasant afternoon in spring we had taken a walk of six or seven miles to see the sun set behind some low mountains {{to the west of the}} town. Most of our walk had been along a hard, smooth highway, and then we turned into a series of narrower roads, sometimes bordered by walls, and sometimes by light fences of reed or cane. Nearing the mountain, to a low spur of which we intended to ascend, we easily scaled a wall about four feet high, and found ourselves upon pasture-land, which led, sometimes by gradual ascents, and sometimes by bits of rough climbing, to the spot we wished to reach. We were afraid we were a little late, and therefore hurried on, running up the grassy hills, and bounding briskly over the rough and rocky places. I carried a knapsack strapped firmly to my shoulders, and under my wife's arm was a large, soft basket of a kind much used by tourists. Her arm was passed through the handles and around the bottom of the <b>basket,</b> which she <b>pressed</b> closely to her side. This was the way she always carried it. The basket contained two bottles of wine, one sweet for my wife, and another a little acid for myself. Sweet wines give me a headache.|$|R
