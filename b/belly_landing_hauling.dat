50|$|During a <b>belly</b> <b>landing,</b> {{there is}} {{normally}} extensive {{damage to the}} airplane. Belly landings carry {{the risk that the}} aircraft may flip over, disintegrate, or catch fire if it lands too fast or too hard.

Strong crosswinds, low visibility, damage to the airplane, or unresponsive instruments or controls greatly increase the danger of performing a <b>belly</b> <b>landing.</b> Still, <b>belly</b> landings {{are one of the most}} common types of aircraft accidents, and are normally not fatal if executed carefully.|$|R
