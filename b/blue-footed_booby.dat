25|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> usually lays one {{to three}} eggs at a time. The species {{practices}} asynchronous hatching, in contrast to many other species whereby incubation begins when the last egg is laid and all chicks hatch together. This results in a growth inequality and size disparity between siblings, leading to facultative siblicide in times of food scarcity. This makes the <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> an important model for studying parent-offspring conflict and sibling rivalry.|$|E
25|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> {{is one of}} {{only two}} species of booby that raises more than one chick in a {{breeding}} cycle.|$|E
25|$|The female <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> lays two {{or three}} eggs. Eggs are laid about four to five days apart. Both male and female take turns {{incubating}} the eggs, while the non-sitting bird keeps watch. Since the <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> {{does not have a}} brooding patch, it uses its feet to keep the eggs warm. The incubation period is 41–45 days. Usually, one to two chicks are hatched from the two to three eggs originally laid. The male and female share parental responsibilities. The male will provide food for the young {{in the first part of}} their life because of his specialized diving. The female will take over when the demand is higher. Chicks feed off the regurgitated fish in the adult's mouth. If the parent <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> does not have enough food for all of the chicks, it will only feed the biggest chick, ensuring that at least one will survive.|$|E
50|$|There are no {{subspecies}} of Peruvian booby, {{but some}} members of the species have been seen to hybridize with <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies.</b>|$|R
50|$|Some of the endemic {{wildlife}} {{featured in}} the series includes frigatebirds, marine iguanas, flightless cormorants, Galápagos tortoises, Galápagos finches and <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies.</b>|$|R
50|$|In one experiment, siblicide {{was shown}} to be somehow related to parental care. When non-obligate siblicidal <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> were swapped with obligate siblicidal masked booby chicks, {{it was found that}} the blue-footed chicks {{exhibited}} more siblicidal behavior.|$|R
25|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> is a {{specialized}} fish eater, feeding on small schooling fish such as sardines, anchovies, mackerel, and flying fish. It will also take squid and offal. The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> hunts by diving {{into the ocean}} after prey, sometimes from a great height, and can also swim underwater in pursuit of its prey. It can hunt singly, in pairs, or in larger flocks. Boobies travel in parties of about 12 to areas of water with large schools of small fish. When the lead bird sees a fish shoal in the water, it will signal {{to the rest of}} the group and they will all dive in unison, pointing their bodies down like arrows.|$|E
25|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> is {{distributed}} among the continental coasts {{of the eastern}} Pacific Ocean from California to the Galápagos Islands down into Peru. It is strictly a marine bird. Its only need for land is to breed and rear young, which it does along the rocky coasts of the eastern Pacific.|$|E
25|$|Concerns of {{a decline}} in the booby {{population}} of the Galapagos Islands prompted a research project in its cause. The project, completed in April 2014, confirmed the population decline. The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> population appears to having trouble breeding and thus is slowly declining. The decline is feared to be long-term, but annual data collection is needed for a firm conclusion {{that this is not a}} normal fluctuation.|$|E
25|$|<b>Blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> make raucous or polysyllabic grunts or {{shouts and}} thin {{whistling}} noises. The males {{of the species}} {{have been known to}} throw up their head and whistle at a passing, flying female. Their ritual displays are also a form of communication.|$|R
50|$|It {{is about}} a 10- to 12-hour trip by boat from Isla Santa Cruz. Tourists {{come to see the}} waved {{albatrosses}} (from March to January, almost the entire world population breeds on the island) and the mating dances of <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> on Española Island.|$|R
50|$|Amongst {{its natural}} attractions is {{the island of}} Salango, home to {{beautiful}} species of seabirds like <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies,</b> frigates, pelicans among others; just off the island’s pristine beach is the marine sanctuary, a site with schools of tropical fish and coral reefs, ideal for diving.|$|R
25|$|The natural {{breeding}} habitats of the <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> are the tropical and subtropical {{islands of the}} Pacific Ocean. It can be found from the Gulf of California down along the western coasts of Central and South America down to Peru. Approximately one half of all breeding pairs nest on the Galápagos Islands. Its diet mainly consists of fish, which it obtains by diving and sometimes swimming underwater in search of its prey. It sometimes hunts alone, but usually hunts in groups.|$|E
25|$|Since the <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> preys on fish by diving {{headlong into}} the water, its {{nostrils}} are permanently closed, {{and it has}} to breathe through the corners of its mouth. Its most notable characteristic is its blue-colored feet, which can range in color from a pale turquoise to a deep aquamarine. Males and younger birds have lighter feet than females. Its blue feet {{play a key role in}} courtship rituals and breeding, with the male visually displaying its feet to attract mates during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|Sea birds (magnificent frigatebird, brown booby, masked booby, terns, double-crested {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocorax auritus), pelican, petrels) nest on the cliffs and uninhabited islands. In particular, on Grand-Îlet, a natural reserve of the archipelago which houses species of booby found nowhere else on les Saintes: red-footed booby (Sula sula) and <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> (Sula nebouxii). But {{in the context}} of global warming and invasive foreign species implanted by the humans (e.g. red lionfish), the environment and the biodiversity of these islands are considered to be very vulnerable and to be protected. It is therefore recommended that visitors do not take plants or capture animals to avoid disturbing the species in their natural biotope, and do not pollute the ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|The blue {{color of}} the <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby's</b> webbed feet comes from {{carotenoid}} pigments obtained from its diet of fresh fish. Carotenoids act as antioxidants and stimulants for the <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby's</b> immune function, suggesting that carotenoid-pigmentation is an indicator of an individual's immunological state. Blue feet also indicate the current health condition of a booby. Boobies that were experimentally food-deprived for forty-eight hours experienced a decrease in foot brightness due {{to a reduction in}} the amount of lipids and lipoproteins that are used to absorb and transport carotenoids. Thus, the feet are rapid and honest indicators of a booby's current level of nourishment. As blue feet are signals that reliably indicate the immunological and health condition of a booby, coloration is favored through sexual selection.|$|R
25|$|Like other sexually size-dimorphic birds, female <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> usually {{favor the}} smaller sex {{during times of}} food scarcity. Booby chicks do not show clear {{differences}} in size based on sex, but females do grow faster than males, which means they require greater parental investment. <b>Blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> display behavior that is described in the Flexible Investment Hypothesis, which states that a female will adjust the allocation of resources to maximize her lifetime reproductive success. This was shown in an experiment in which females had their flight feathers trimmed, so {{that they had to}} expend more energy during flights to obtain food for their broods. Female chicks of such mothers were more strongly affected than their brothers, in that they had lower masses and shorter wing lengths.|$|R
40|$|<b>Blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> (Sula nebouxii) are {{socially}} monogamous, colonial seabirds exhibiting intra-specific nest parasitism and extra-pair copulations. Prior DNA fingerprinting assays failed to detect extra-pair offspring in the nests of congeners, {{and the rate}} of intra-specific nest parasitism has not been estimated using molecular techniques. We describe the development and characterization of 11 microsatellite DNA loci, tested using 31 individuals collected on Isla Isabel, Nayarit, México. The number of alleles per locus ranged from three to 22, averaging seven; total exclusionary power of the microsatellite panel was 0. 99; no loci deviated from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium; and we did not detect linkage disequilibrium following Bonferroni correction. This microsatellite panel will facilitate future studies of nest parasitism and extra-pair paternity in <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies...</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>Blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> {{parents are}} passive spectators of this intrabrood conflict. They do not {{intervene}} in their offspring's struggles, {{even at the}} point of siblicide. Booby parents even appear to facilitate the demise of the younger sibling by creating and maintaining the inequality between the two chicks. They reinforce the brood hierarchy by feeding the dominant chick more often than the subordinate one. Thus, they respond to the brood hierarchy and not to the level of begging when deciding which chick to feed, as both chicks beg in equal amounts. This level of passivity towards the very possible death of their younger offspring may be an indication that brood reduction is advantageous for the parents. The Insurance Egg Hypothesis views the second egg and resulting chick as insurance for the parent in case the first egg does not hatch, or if food levels are higher than expected.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> is {{on average}} [...] long and weighs , {{with the female}} being {{slightly}} larger than the male. Its wings are long and pointed and brown in color. The neck {{and head of the}} <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> are light brown with white streaks while the belly and underside exhibit pure white plumage. Its eyes are placed on either side of its bill and oriented towards the front, enabling excellent binocular vision. Its eyes are a distinctive yellow, with the male having more yellow in its irises than the female. <b>Blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> chicks have black beaks and feet and are clad in a layer of soft white down. The subspecies S. n. excisa that breeds on the Galapagos Islands is larger than the nominate subspecies and has lighter plumage especially around the neck and head.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> is monogamous, {{although}} {{it has the potential}} to be bigamous. It is an opportunistic breeder, with the breeding cycle occurring every 8 to 9 months. The courtship of the <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> consists of the male flaunting his blue feet and dancing to impress the female. The male begins by showing his feet, strutting in front of the female. Then, he presents nest materials and finishes the mating ritual with a final display of his feet. The dance also includes [...] "sky-pointing", which involves the male pointing his head and bill up to the sky while keeping the wings and tail raised.|$|E

25|$|Mates can {{recognize}} {{each other by}} their calls. Researchers have analyzed calls of <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> and conducted playback experiments. Although calls differed between sexes, unique individual signatures were present. It was found that {{both males and females}} can discriminate the calls of their mates from others.|$|R
2500|$|The name booby {{comes from}} the Spanish word bobo ("stupid", [...] "foolish", or [...] "clown") because the <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> is, like other seabirds, clumsy on land. They are also {{regarded}} as foolish for their apparent fearlessness of humans.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> was {{described}} by the French naturalist Alphonse Milne-Edwards in 1882 under the current binomial name Sula nebouxii.

2500|$|However, booby {{parents may}} not be as {{indifferent}} as they seem. Experimental evidence suggests that the parental behavior described above may be masking parent-offspring conflict. It was discovered that <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> parents make steep-sided nests that serve to deter the early ejection of the younger chick by the older sibling. This is in direct contrast to the masked booby, a species in which siblicide is obligate due to the ease in which older siblings can eject younger chicks from their flat nests. When <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> nests were experimentally flattened, parents restored them to their original steepness. [...] In another experiment, <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> chicks that were placed in masked booby nests were {{more likely to engage in}} siblicide, which reveals that parental care somehow affects the level of siblicide. Parents also appear to respond more frequently to chicks that are in poorer body conditions during periods of food deprivation. [...] Egg-mass analysis shows that in clutches produced at the beginning of the breeding season, the second egg in a nest were, on average, 1.5% heavier than the first. Since heavier eggs give rise to heavier chicks that have greater fitness, this evidence indicates that parents may try to rectify any disadvantages that accompany a late hatching date by investing more into the second egg. [...] Hormonal analysis of eggs also shows that there appears to be no parental favoritism in regards to androgen allocation. It is important to note, however, that this may simply be that the species has evolved simpler ways to manipulate asymmetries and maximize parental reproductive output. Experiments show that what may at first appear to be parental cooperation with the elder chick may in fact mask a genetic parent-offspring conflict.|$|E
5000|$|Local boat tours {{also take}} {{visitors}} to two popular nearby dive sites. [...] "Kicker Rock" [...] (the Spanish name is [...] "León Dormido") represents {{the remains of}} a lava cone, now split in two. [...] "Isla Lobos" [...] (sea lion island) is also a nesting site for <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies.</b>|$|R
50|$|By late 1953, {{rain had}} removed the ash and pumice {{deposits}} in the steeper places of northern San Benedicto. At {{least half the}} previously recorded plant taxa were again present. Numerous seabirds were found breeding, most north of Herrera but a colony of <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> was present in the ditch between Herrera and Barcena.|$|R
50|$|Academy Bay is a busy harbor, {{normally}} full {{of boats}} cruising the islands, passing private yachts and local fishing boats.

2500|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> (Sula nebouxii) is {{a marine}} bird native to {{subtropical}} and tropical {{regions of the}} eastern Pacific Ocean. It is one of six species of the genus Sula – known as boobies. It is easily recognizable by its distinctive bright blue feet, which is a sexually selected trait. Males display their feet in an elaborate mating ritual by lifting them up and down while strutting before the female. The female is slightly larger than the male and can measure up to [...] long with a wingspan of up to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The <b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby</b> lays one {{to three}} eggs in one nest at a time, {{although}} 80% of nests only contain two eggs. [...] Eggs are laid five days apart. After the first egg is laid, it is immediately incubated, which results in a difference in chick hatching times. The first chick hatches {{four days before the}} other, so it receives a four-day head start in growth compared to its younger sibling. This asynchronous hatching serves many purposes. First, it spaces out the difficult time period in rearing during which newborn chicks are too feeble to accept regurgitated food. In addition, it reduces the chance that parents will suffer total brood loss to predators such as the milk snake.|$|E
2500|$|At the University of Leuven he met {{the poet}} Pol De Mont who was a year older. [...] Together they sought to promote a Flemish artistic revival and equal rights for Flemish {{students}} as a student movement, creating the [...] "Algemene Vlaamse Studentenbond" [...] (All Flemish Student Association) in 1876. Among their objectives were to have classes in Dutch and to have classes include Flemish culture. [...] The association’s illustrated magazine Het Pennoen (The Pennant) published Rodenbach’s essays anonymously. [...] Rodenbach maintained his contacts in Roeselare through a committee of correspondence. Their ideology {{was a mixture of}} the philosophy Guido Gezelle, with the romantic nationalism of Hendrik Conscience, and the righteousness of true belief. Robenbach and de Mont called their student movement Blauwvoeterie after the blauwvoet (<b>blue-footed</b> <b>booby)</b> whose flight announces the coming storm. [...] The rallying cry of the Blauwvoeterie was Vliegt de blauvoet, storm op zee! (When the bluefoot flies, there is a storm at sea!) Rodenbach compared it to the German Burschenschaften movement.|$|E

40|$|When two {{closely related}} species, with each species {{presenting}} strong sex specific differences in size, coexist resource partitioning can be expected. We studied the sex specific foraging behaviour of two sympatric seabird {{species in the}} Gulf of California to disentangle the respective role of the species, of the sex and of the size in the differences in foraging behaviour observed. We used high precision data loggers to study foraging movements as well as diving behaviour and activity of brown and <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies</b> rearing young chicks. The study shows that some differences observed in foraging behaviour are mainly due to size, in particular the depths attained during diving, the flight speeds and flapping frequency. The differences between species were limited, brown boobies having longer foraging trips and spending less time on the water than <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies.</b> The major differences observed were sex specific, in each species females tend to have longer foraging trips, to forage farther from the colony and to cover longer distances, to have larger zones of area restricted search. The sex specific differences are more pronounced in brown than in <b>blue-footed</b> <b>boobies.</b> Analysis of diet and stable isotopes shows that {{during the study period}} both species feed on sardines, and that outside the breeding season the Carbone and nitrogen signatures are similar. In these sympatric species feeding on a super abundant prey, the sex specific differences are more pronounced that species specific differences, suggesting that sex specific differences may be mainly related to breeding involvement, males being more involved in nest attendance and defence, and females in provisioning. The role of size is particularly important in the parameters influenced by biomechanics constraints such as flight and diving...|$|R
