A newly {{constructed}} turreted building, {{meant to}} look like Windsor castle, the hotel had extremely lavish decorations such as mirrors made of diamond dust.

60|$|Not {{only did}} the houses I {{investigated}} have no <b>bath-tubs,</b> but I learned {{that there were no}} <b>bath-tubs</b> in all the thousands of houses I had seen. Under the circumstances, with my wife and babies and a couple of lodgers suffering from the too great spaciousness of one room, taking a bath in a tin wash-basin would be an unfeasible undertaking. But, it seems, the compensation comes in with the saving of soap, so all's well, and God's still in heaven.|$|R

60|$|I {{heard his}} stately tramp die away, {{step by step}} {{down the stairs and}} out into the deserted street, and felt sorry that he was gone, poor fellow --and sorrier still that he had carried off my red blanket and my <b>bath-tub.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1905, author Joseph Amasa Munk {{described}} how the spring water was [...] "conducted through pipes into the bath house, where it supplies {{a row of}} <b>bath-tubs</b> with water of any desired temperature".

60|$|He led the {{way through}} the {{corridor}} into a large room where a row of <b>bath-tubs</b> flanked the wall, half of them filled with bathers, who chatted in tones of subdued cheerfulness under the pleasant excitement of unlimited hot and cold water.

[...] "We were twins, and one {{day when}} we were two weeks old--that is, he was one week old, and I was one week old--we got mixed up in the <b>bath-tub,</b> and one of us drowned.

60|$|A {{minute later}} {{the door was}} unlocked, and we filed into the barber-shop. Here were more men in convict stripes. They were the prison barbers. Also, there were <b>bath-tubs,</b> hot water, soap, and scrubbing-brushes.

After the bath, we were each given a canvas clothes-bag.|$|R
50|$|Serving a {{multitude}} of purposes, pottery can tell {{a great deal about}} the society in which they were produced. Large jars were used as containers for storage of goods, while others like stirrup jars were designed for the transportation of certain commodities. As well, there were also vessels for preparing and cooking food, for eating and drinking and many other diverse activities including <b>bath-tubs,</b> braziers, oil lamps, bee-hives, flower pots, etc. Most evidently, the shape, size, and perhaps even the decoration of the vases were closely related to their use in the Ancient world.|$|R
60|$|There was bustling {{to and fro}} of her and her maids; decking of {{the hall}} in the best hangings; strewing of fresh rushes, to the {{dislodgement}} of Martin; setting out of square tables, and stoops and mugs thereon; cooking of victuals, broaching of casks; and above all, for Hereward's self, heating of much water, and setting out, in the inner chamber, of the great <b>bath-tub</b> and bath-sheet, which was the special delight of a hero fresh from the war.|$|E
60|$|At {{that moment}} a G. A. R. veteran was dying. He {{had come from}} the Civil War {{straight}} to a farm which, though it was officially within the city-limits of Zenith, was primitive as the backwoods. He had never ridden in a motor car, never seen a <b>bath-tub,</b> never read any book save the Bible, McGuffey's readers, and religious tracts; and he believed that the earth is flat, that the English are the Lost Ten Tribes of Israel, and that the United States is a democracy.|$|E
60|$|Life {{remained}} {{very simple}} and very democratic {{in our little}} town. Although the county seat, it was slow in taking on city ways. I don't believe a real <b>bath-tub</b> distinguished the place (I never heard of one) but its sidewalks kept our feet out of the mud (even in March or April), {{and this was a}} marvellous fact to us. One or two fine lawns and flower gardens had come in, and year by year the maples had grown until they now made a pleasant shade in June, and in October glorified the plank walks. To us it was beautiful.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't be flippant, Bayliss," [...] he protested. [...] "Try to cure {{yourself}} of this passion for being funny {{at the wrong}} time.

6000|$|... "Now {{let me do}} the talking," [...] said Peter. [...] "They {{are all in the}} woods; we don't make {{camps in}} pasture-fields.

6000|$|Lapham {{looked as}} if he did not quite like this tone, and he resumed a little more quietly. [...] "Oh, there isn't really very much more to say about the paint itself. But you can use it for almost {{anything}} where a paint is wanted, inside or out. It'll prevent decay, and it'll stop it, after it's begun, in tin or iron. You can paint the inside of a cistern or a <b>bath-tub</b> with it, and water won't hurt it; and you can paint a steam-boiler with it, and heat won't. You can cover a brick wall with it, or a railroad car, or the deck of a steamboat, and you can't do a better thing for either." ...|$|E
6000|$|Shortly {{after they}} had settled {{themselves}} with elaborate impudence on the back seat, the singing began. Just as they were singing the last verse, every individual voice wavered and all but died out in astonishment to see William Bacon come in--an unheard-of thing! And with a clean shirt, too! Bacon, to tell the truth, was feeling as much out of place as a cat in a <b>bath-tub,</b> and looked uncomfortable, even shamefaced, as he sidled in, his shapeless hat gripped nervously in both hands; coatless and collarless, his shirt open at his massive throat. The girls tittered, of course, and the boys hammered each other's ribs, moved by the unusual sight. Milton Jennings, sitting beside Bettie Moss, said:-- ...|$|E
60|$|But {{it was a}} dainty charge, deftly delivered, and {{it ended}} by the Cavalry finding itself {{at the head of}} the pass by which the Afghans {{intended}} to retreat; and down the track that the lances had made streamed two companies of the Highlanders, which was never intended by the Brigadier. The new development was successful. It detached the enemy from his base as a sponge is torn from a rock, and left him ringed about with fire in that pitiless plain. And as a sponge is chased round the <b>bath-tub</b> by the hand of the bather, so were the Afghans chased till they broke into little detachments much more difficult to dispose of than large masses.|$|E
6000|$|He {{spent all}} that day roaming over the house. He nearly drowned {{himself in the}} <b>bath-tubs,</b> put his nose into the ink on a writing table, and burned it {{on the end of}} the big man's cigar, for he climbed up in the big man's lap to see how writing was done. At nightfall he ran into Teddy's nursery to watch how {{kerosene}} lamps were lighted, and when Teddy went to bed Rikki-tikki climbed up too. But he was a restless companion, because he had to get up and attend to every noise all through the night, and find out what made it. Teddy's mother and father came in, the last thing, to look at their boy, and Rikki-tikki was awake on the pillow. [...] "I don't like that," [...] said Teddy's mother. [...] "He may bite the child."

40|$|The {{natural habitat}} of {{opportunistic}} fungal pathogens is {{outside of the}} host; therefore, {{it is crucial to}} understand their ecology and routes of transmission. In this study, we investigated the presence of black and filamentous fungi in moist indoor environments in the city of Mersin in subtropical Turkey. In total, 177 private dwellings were screened and 893 samples obtained using cotton swabs and moistened with physiological saline from dishwashers, washing machines, refrigerators, <b>bath-tubs,</b> bathroom walls, and shower heads. These were then inoculated onto malt extract agar supplemented with chloramphenicol, followed by incubation at 37 °C. Thirty samples (3. 4 %) were positive for fungi, which were then identified by sequencing the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region. Exophiala dermatitidis was the most common species (23), followed by E. phaeomuriformis (three), Magnusiomyces capitatus (two), and Candida parapsilosis (two). Genotype A of E. dermatitidis (14) was more prevalent than genotypes B (eight) and C (one) and E. phaeomuriformis was also represented by two genotypes. Our findings suggest that dishwashers are a major indoor niche for thermophilic black yeasts. The occurrence of the opportunistic filamentous fungus M. capitatus in dishwashers is consistent with a recent report...|$|R
6000|$|At {{last the}} {{faithful}} servitor, {{who had helped}} to fight the Battle of the Mail Bags at Udaipur, broke his silence, and vowing that all these devil-people--not more than twelve--had only {{come to see the}} fun, suggested the breaking of the munshi's head. And, indeed, that seemed the best way of breaking the ice; for the munshi had, in the politest possible language, put forward the suggestion that there was nothing particular to show that the Sahib who held the purwana had really any right to hold it. The chowkidar woke up and chanted a weird chant, accompanied by the Anglo-Saxon attitudes, a new set. He was an old man, and all the Sahib-log said so, and within the pavilion were tables and chairs and lamps and <b>bath-tubs,</b> and everything that the heart of man could desire. Even now an enormous staff of menials were arranging all these things for the comfort of the Sahib Bahadur and Protector of the Poor, who had brought the honour and glory of his Presence all the way from Deoli. What did tables and chairs and eggs and fowls and very bright lamps matter to the Raj? He was an old man and ... "Who put the present Raja on the throne?" [...] "Lake Sahib," [...] promptly answered the chowkidar. [...] "I was there. That is the news of many old years." [...] Now Tod says it was he himself who installed [...] "Lalji the beloved" [...] in the year 1821. The Englishman began to lose faith in the chowkidar. The munshi said nothing but followed the Englishman with his one workable eye. A merry little breeze crisped the waters of the lake, and the fish began to frolic before going to bed.|$|R
60|$|Such was {{the penalty}} of too passionate and {{unrestrained}} an admiration for American bathrooms; yet {{the connection of}} ideas, however inconsequent, does cover the part of social practice for which these American institutions can really be praised. About everything like laundry or hot and cold water there is not only organisation, but what does not always or perhaps often go with it, efficiency. Americans are particular about these things of dress and decorum; {{and it is a}} virtue which I very seriously recognise, though I find it very hard to emulate. But with them it is a virtue; it is not a mere convention, still less a mere fashion. It is really related to human dignity rather than to social superiority. The really glorious thing about the American is that he does not dress like a gentleman; he dresses like a citizen or a civilised man. His Puritanic particularity on certain points is really detachable from any definite social ambitions; these things are not a part of getting into society but merely of keeping out of savagery. Those millions and millions of middling people, that huge middle class especially of the Middle West, are not near enough to any aristocracy even to be sham aristocrats, or to be real snobs. But their standards are secure; and though I do not really travel in a <b>bath-tub,</b> or believe in the <b>bath-tub</b> philosophy and religion, I will not on this matter recoil misanthropically from them: I prefer the tub of Dayton to the tub of Diogenes. On these points there is really something a million times better than efficiency, and that is something like equality.|$|E

He found his Lordship in his bath-room.

6000|$|We {{have had}} a bath in Milan, in a public bath-house. They {{were going to put}} all three of us in one <b>bath-tub,</b> but we objected. Each of us had an Italian farm on his back. We could have felt {{affluent}} if we had been officially surveyed and fenced in. We chose to have three bathtubs, and large ones--tubs suited to the dignity of aristocrats who had real estate, and brought it with them. After we were stripped and had taken the first chilly dash, we discovered that haunting atrocity that has embittered our lives in so many cities and villages of Italy and France --there was no soap.

To say nothing of the blessings of poverty, I'm sure they're much happier than we are, with our onerous duties, I'm sure that if any of these ragamuffin anarchists and socialists and anti-militarists want to take over my committees they are welcome, if they'll take over the miserable headaches and worried hours they give me, trying to do something for the poor, they won't even be clean but even in model tenements they will put coal in the <b>bath-tubs.</b> And so I do hope you haven't just been wearing yourself to a bone working for ungrateful dirty little children, Ruthie." ...|$|R
40|$|About 100 people aged 55 {{years or}} older die by {{drowning}} each year in Australia. About another 75 per year are admitted to hospital following non-fatal drowning. About one-third of these cases have characteristics that suggest that they were severe.   Of the drowning deaths, about 72 % are unintentional, 24 % are suicides, 3 % are of undetermined intent and 1 % are homicides.   The annual average of 75 unintentional drowning deaths per annum {{in this age group}} comprises deaths in natural bodies of water (n = 26), swimming pools (n = 6), <b>bath-tubs</b> (n = 5), events related to water transport (n = 11), storms and floods (n = 1) and miscellaneous and unspecified cases (n =  26).   Drowning accounts for only a small proportion of the hospitalised cases recorded as occurring at places and during activities that can be regarded as ‘aquatic’. This is so for persons aged 55 years and older and for persons of all ages. For persons aged 55 years and older, the annual average count of cases at aquatic places was 788, of which  52 (7 %) involved non-fatal drowning. Equivalent annual average case counts for Activities identifiable as aquatic were 534 (total) and 57 (non-fatal drowning, 11 %).   Falls were a common mechanism of injury for people aged 55 years and older hospitalised due to events at aquatic places. Falls accounted for 40 % of all cases occurring at places identifiable as aquatic, 67 % of those at swimming centres and 57 % of those at beaches. Hence, while prevention of drowning remains the primary issue for aquatic safety (because of the potential for fatalities and serious persisting morbidity) attention to the prevention of other types of injuries that occur in aquatic settings is also warranted.   This Briefing is based on a preliminary investigation of this topic. Further investigation is feasible {{on the basis of the}} data sources presently available.   Written by James E Harrison, Renate Kreisfeld and Geoffrey Henle...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{derives from}} the study of the Eastern Building Complex on the Mycenaean acropolis at Kanakia, Salamis, which is being {{excavated}} since 2000 by the University of Ioannina. It consists of 7 chapters and 10 appendices, with special emphasis on the retrieved pottery. The excavation of the acropolis has been steadily revealing the major urban centre of Salamis during the Late Mycenaean period, illuminating aspects of the history and conduct of the local population, until the total abandonment of the site, within the general horizon of the fall of the palaces ca. 1200 B. C. In the chapters of the thesis are presented all data (topographical, architectural and contents) concerning the Eastern Complex, which has been uncovered on the upper level of the acropolis and forms part of the local palatial unit; this is demonstrated by a number of elements and {{on the basis of a}} new suggested approach for the identification of such centres. In this framework, the Eastern Complex had a multileveled and controlling role for the circulation on the upper level of the acropolis and comprised storage and auxiliary rooms, working areas and other rooms. Special emphasis is laid on the Mycenaean pottery from the Eastern Complex. The lack of similar local studies and the limited knowledge of the Mycenaean period in Salamis was a challenge for the approach of the material. With a combined study of typological, morphological and analytical (petrographical and chemical) characteristics, pottery groups from Aegina and Attica were documented, which are formed by the same construction technique. Particularly revealing for the pottery production on Aegina was the identification of a broad repertory of pot-shapes, made of a kitchen-ware fabric. Local production of pottery was not identified. Of considerable value is the lime plaster found on the interior of clay <b>bath-tubs</b> from the Eastern Complex and on the floors and walls of areas in Building Gamma as coating. The similar mode of construction and the high quality of the plaster highlight the level of technical knowledge and underline the notion of its local production. Further study of the pottery found in other buildings of the acropolis and the continuing excavation of the architectural network will enrich the outlined background, complete aspects of pottery production and consumption, on a local and regional level, and will further illuminate the life of the population of the Mycenaean capital of Salamis. ...|$|R
