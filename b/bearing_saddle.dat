5000|$|For 1949, Cadillac and Oldsmobile each {{produced}} a new V8 design (the Oldsmobile engine was the 303).Both {{of the engines}} were Overhead valve designs. The Cadillac 331 engine featured a [...] "dry" [...] (coolant exited through an assembly attached directly to the cylinder heads), open runner (requiring {{the use of a}} tappet valve cover) intake manifold, rear-mounted distributor, and shaft-mounted rockers. Crankshaft end play is carried by the rear bearing on the two GM engines. It has the lighter 'skirtless' block where the oil pan flange does not descend appreciably below the crankshaft centerline and they both have a partial integral cast iron clutch housing that compares to the early Chrysler Hemi V8 design. 1955 331 engines went to a lighter [...] "flat back" [...] that bolted to a clutch and flywheel housing {{at the front of the}} transmission.This engine features an oiling system which uses a central cast-in passage between the lifter galleries feeding oil to the cam and crank by grooves machined into the cam bores. A single drilled passage per <b>bearing</b> <b>saddle</b> feeds both cam and crank journals. Shared with the Oldsmobile Rocket V8 is how the lifters are supplied oil through small 'bleeds' instead of placing the lifters directly into the right and left side oil supply galleries. Many early racers would replace the Cadillac hydraulic lifter and rocker assemblies with the solid lifters and adjustable rockers from the Studebaker v8 for operation at higher rpm.|$|E

It is fitted with solid rubber tires. The rims, frame, fork, and handlebars {{are made from}} hollow, steel tubing. The steel axles are mounted in adjustable ball <b>bearings.</b> The leather <b>saddle</b> is suspended by springs.|$|R
5000|$|Due to {{the speed}} with which the 244 engine was moved from design to production, engines failed in service with high {{frequency}} in 1946 and 1947. For example the first 20 of the 244 engines installed in GM&O freight units had to be rebuilt with new forged crankshafts. [...] Despite the redesign of crankshafts, the new forged versions continued to fail, particularly in the 12-cylinder engines; this problem was traced to metallurgical flaws in components from a supplier. [...] Flaws in welding main <b>bearing</b> <b>saddles</b> to the engine block resulted in about 600 blocks replaced, while both the <b>saddles</b> and <b>bearings</b> themselves required redesign and replacement. [...] GE air-cooled RD-1 turbocharger assemblies also required repeated redesign of both manifolds and turbines. By early 1948, ALCO had spent $4.3 million on field repairs and modifications of 244 engines. In 1950, the first engines with upgrades new from the factory, dubbed the 244D, were installed in locomotives, beginning with the RS-3. [...] In 1953, the RD-1 and RD-2 turbochargers were replaced with GE water-cooled RD-3 and RD-4 models, followed the next year by ALCO-designed and built 510 and 710 turbos. This corresponded with the refinement of the 244 to versions 244G and 244H. The Alco 244H engine is also known as the Alco 250 engine. This was done by Alco to disassociate the 250 from the troublesome 244 engine. The 250 was produced for a short time from 1955 into 1956. It was also used as a standard to rebuild older 244 engines at Schenectady.|$|R

60|$|He watched, therefore, anxiously to whose {{service the}} palfrey <b>bearing</b> the lady's <b>saddle</b> was destined. But ere any female {{appeared}} to occupy it, he was himself summoned {{to take his}} seat on the pillion behind Cristal Nixon, amid the grins of his old acquaintance Jan who helped him to horse, and the unrestrained laughter of Cicely, who displayed on the occasion a case of teeth which might have rivalled ivory.|$|R
50|$|The 351W {{is often}} {{confused}} with the 351 Cleveland, which is a different engine of identical displacement.The 351 cuin L Windsor featured a 1.3 in (32.5 mm) taller deck height than the 302, allowing a stroke of 3.5 in (88.9 mm). Although very much related in general configuration to the 289-302 and sharing the same bell housing, motor mounts, and other small parts, the 351W had a unique, tall-deck block, larger main bearing caps, thicker, longer connecting rods, and a distinct firing order (1-3-7-2-6-5-4-8 versus the usual 1-5-4-2-6-3-7-8, a means to move the unacceptable 'noise' of the consecutive firing adjacent front cylinders to the more rigid rear part of the engine block all while reducing excessive main bearing load), adding some 25 lb (11 kg) to the engine's dry weight. The distributor is slightly different, so as to accommodate a larger oil pump shaft and larger oil pump. Some years had threaded dipstick tubes. It had a unique head which optimized torque over high-rpm breathing, frequently replaced by enthusiasts with aftermarket heads providing better performance. The early 1969 and 1970 heads had larger valves and ports for better performance. The head castings and valve head sizes from 1969 to 1976 were different, notably in passages for air injection and spark plug diameters (1969-1974 18 mm, 1975 and up 14 mm). From 1977 onward, the 351W shared the same head casting as the 302, differing only in bolt hole diameters (7/16 inch for 302, 1/2 inch for 351W). Early blocks (casting ID C9OE-6015-B) had enough metal on <b>bearing</b> <b>saddles</b> 2, 3, and 4 for four-bolt mains, and as with all small-block Fords (SBFs), were superior in strength to most late-model, lightweight castings. Generally, the 1969 to 1974 blocks {{are considered to be}} far superior in strength than the later blocks, making these early units some of the strongest and most desirable in the entire SBF engine family including the 335-series. During the 1980s, a four-barrel version (intake manifold casting ID E6TE-9425-B) was reintroduced for use in light trucks and vans. In 1988, fuel injection replaced the four-barrel carburetor. Roller camshaft/lifters were introduced in this engine in 1994.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{independent}} axis {{dynamics of}} machine tools that employ long slender lead screws, <b>bearings,</b> and workpiece <b>saddles,</b> mounted on supporting slides, will be considered. Distributed-lumped parameter techniques {{will be used}} for system analysis and in the model formulation procedures. Realizations that encompass combined torsional and tension loading will be incorporated. Specific, integrated, distributed-lumped machine tool configurations will be derived and described in block diagram form. Simulation studies illustrating the dynamic signature of a machine tool axis drive, when operated at various feed rates, together with the measured results will be presented. The effect of changes in the effective lead-screw length on the workpiece surface finish will be commented on...|$|R
50|$|The {{surface unit}} {{transfers}} energy for pumping the well from the prime-mover to the sucker rod string. In doing this, it must change the rotary {{motion of the}} prime-mover to reciprocating motion for the sucker rod. And it must reduce {{the speed of the}} prime-mover to a suitable pumping speed. Speed reduction is accomplished by using a gear reducer, and rotary motion of thencrank shaft is converted to oscillatory motion by means of a walking beam. The crank arm is connected to the walking beam by means of a pitman arm. The walking beam is supported by a Samson post and <b>saddle</b> <b>bearing.</b> The horse head and bridle are used to ensure that the pull on the sucker rod string is vertical all times so that no bearing movement is applied to that part of sucker rod string above stuffing box. The polished rod and stuffing box combination is used to maintain a good liquid seal at the surface.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1960s Premac was {{manufacturing}} many contract {{parts for}} the heavy industries {{located in the}} Midwest United States. One of the parts being manufactured was a skid plate with Premac's [...] "Prelon" [...] material bonded to it. This eventually morphed into a round bushing (as a bronze bearing replacement) and sadle bearings for hydraulic pumps. In the very early 1980s, a salesman for PBC visited companies in the Detroit, MI area to explain PBC's products and capabilities. At this time, the primary use for PBC bearings was as a <b>saddle</b> <b>bearing</b> in hydraulic pumps (typical Inner Diameter ranged from 6.000 inches to 14.000 inches) for large trucks and equipment. A manufacturing engineer was in the meeting and asked if the technology could be adapted into a much smaller package as he had linear ball bearings which were constantly failing. A quick conference call with the factory and the concept for the Simplicity Bearing was born.|$|R
6000|$|The natural {{development}} {{of his position}} {{under the influence of}} Lady Marayne had enormously enlarged the circle of his acquaintances. He had taken part in all sorts of social occasions, and sat and listened to a representative selection of political and literary and social personages, he had been several times to the opera and to a great number and variety of plays, he had been attentively inconspicuous in several really good week-end parties. He had spent a golden October in North Italy with his mother, and escaped from the glowing lassitude of Venice for some days of climbing in the Eastern Alps. In January, in an outbreak of enquiry, he had gone with Lionel Maxim to St. Petersburg and had eaten zakuska, brightened his eyes with vodka, talked with a number of charming people of the war that was then imminent, listened to gipsy singers until dawn, careered in sledges about the most silent and stately of capitals, and returned with Lionel, discoursing upon autocracy and assassination, Japan, the Russian destiny, and the government of Peter the Great. That excursion was the most after his heart of all the dispersed employments of his first year. Through the rest of the winter he kept himself very fit, and still further qualified that nervous dislike for the horse that he had acquired from Prothero by hunting once a week in Essex. He was incurably a bad horseman; he rode without sympathy, he was unready and convulsive at hedges and ditches, and he judged distances badly. His white face and rigid seat and a certain joylessness of <b>bearing</b> in the <b>saddle</b> earned him the singular nickname, which never reached his ears, of the [...] "Galvanized Corpse." [...] He got through, however, at the cost of four quite trifling spills and without damaging either of the horses he rode. And his physical self-respect increased.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Influence of {{dentures}} relining on saddles material {{effort in}} case of bone foundation not affected by anyatrophic changes has been examined. Design/methodology/approach: Stresses levels in material of denture <b>saddles</b> <b>bearing</b> structure have beendetermined for any cases where alveolar ridges of mandible are well preserved. This research has been carried outin simulated conditions of biting loads, {{by means of a}} FEM. Compared were not-relined vs. relined saddles for twovariants of bottom denture saddles margins, i. e. ended smoothly and with an extension that increases the amount ofmaterial of the bearing structure. Analyzed was also the influence on deformability of relining layers. Findings: Equivalent Huber-Misses stresses on a good saddles surface {{in case of}} a not-relined denture haveslightly exceeded the level of 2 MPa, whereas in case of a relined denture with a soft margin they have reached 4 MPa; and for variant of relined denture with extended margin they reached a level of 14 MPa. Modulus ofelasticity of the relining has not influenced significantly the effort of saddles material. Research limitations/implications: Assumed were vertical loading forces of 100 N simplified denturegeometry without separating any complex shapes of artificial teeth. Practical implications: Increase of the bearing surface of relined saddles by means of extended margins resultsin stress concentration. Hence, attempts should be made to form the margins and teeth profiles changes at their basesmoothly. All micro damages in endangered areas of saddlesâ margins should be removed. Originality/value: Relining of low denturesâ saddles in a well preserved bone foundation does not directly resultin excedance of allowable stress levels for prosthetic acrylic resins. Hence, the causes of failures should be soughtin the impact of geometrical notches, or potentially existing damages that initiate degradation processes...|$|R
