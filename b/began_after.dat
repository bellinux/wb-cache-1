5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} <b>began</b> <b>after</b> Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided {{a basis for}} staging the work in its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds {{became the basis for}} Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E

5|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20th century, the Church of the Holy Mother of God was the {{terminus}} of two rival religious processions organised by the ethnic Greek and Bulgarian communities of Asenovgrad.

These processions <b>began</b> <b>after</b> a man claimed to have seen lights and heard chants while passing near the then-abandoned church.

5|$|In {{the early}} 13th century, with the Hoysala power {{remaining}} unchallenged, {{the first of}} the Muslim incursions into South India <b>began.</b> <b>After</b> over two decades of waging war against a foreign power, the Hoysala ruler at the time, Veera Ballala III, died in the battle of Madurai in 1343. This resulted in the merger of the sovereign territories of the Hoysala empire with the areas administered by Harihara I, founder of the Vijayanagara Empire, located in the Tungabhadra region in present-day Karnataka. The new kingdom thrived for another two centuries with Vijayanagara as its capital.|$|E

5|$|Steel was {{produced}} in bloomery furnaces for thousands of years, but its large-scale, industrial use only <b>began</b> <b>after</b> more efficient production methods were devised in the 17th century, with the production of blister steel and then crucible steel.

5|$|The {{perception}} {{of communism in}} the US was shaped by the Cold War, which <b>began</b> <b>after</b> World WarII when the Soviet Union failed to uphold the commitments it made at the Yalta Conference. Instead of holding elections for new governments, as agreed at Yalta, the Soviet Union occupied several Eastern European countries, leading to a strained relationship with the US. Subsequent international events served to increase the apparent danger that communism posed to Americans: the Stalinist threats in the Greek Civil War (1946–1949); the Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948; and the 1948 blockade of Berlin.|$|E
