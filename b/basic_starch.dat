5|$|Beer {{was spread}} through Europe by Germanic and Celtic tribes {{as far back}} as 3000 BC, and it was mainly brewed on a {{domestic}} scale. The product that the early Europeans drank might not be recognised as beer by most people today. Alongside the <b>basic</b> <b>starch</b> source, the early European beers might contain fruits, honey, numerous types of plants, spices and other substances such as narcotic herbs. What they did not contain was hops, as that was a later addition, first mentioned in Europe around 822 by a Carolingian Abbot and again in 1067 by Abbess Hildegard of Bingen.|$|E
50|$|Despite the {{introduction}} of wheat and rice to Mexico, the <b>basic</b> <b>starch</b> remains corn in almost {{all areas of the}} country and is the base of many recipes (e.g. corn tortillas, atole, pozole, menudo, tamales). While it is eaten fresh, most corn is dried, treated with lime and ground into a dough called masa. This dough is used both fresh and fermented to make a wide variety of dishes from drinks (atole, pozole, etc.) to tamales, sopes, and much more. However, the most common way to eat corn in Mexico {{is in the form of}} a tortilla, which accompanies almost every dish. Tortillas are made of corn in most of the country, but other versions exist, such as wheat in the north or plantain, yuca and wild greens in Oaxaca.|$|E

The study involved tests on both raw potatoes, and on starch separated from potatoes, and embraced three main activities: (i) to relate boiled-potato texture with the other test variables; (ii) to develop a rapid crush-test for assessing cooked-potato texture; (iii) to study the effect of chilling and freezing {{on the development of}} resistant starch (RS) in boiled potatoes.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the twin}} {{extrusion}} process, <b>starch</b> <b>basic</b> structure is modified {{and it is}} very important to be able to predict the changes experienced by the product. To model the transformation of starch during twin screw extrusion, it is thus necessary to take into account the strong coupling between viscosity and thermomechanical treatment. It is the purpose of the present work. We have used the software Ludovic (c) to calculate the flow of a molten starch along a twin screw extruder. We have assumed that the degradation reaction (viscosity decrease) was linked to the specific mechanical energy received during the flow. We have compared extrusion cases with and without viscosity/energy coupling, and we show that it is important to take it into account to correctly predict the parameters of the extrusion process (torque, energy, product temperature, etc.) and the level of starch transformation...|$|R

40|$|Starch is an {{important}} plant product widely used as a nutrient, {{as a source of}} renewable energy, and for many technological applications. In plants, starch is the almost ubiquitous storage carbohydrate whereas most heterotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotes rely on glycogen. Despite close similarities in <b>basic</b> chemical features, <b>starch</b> and glycogen differ in both structural and physicochemical properties. Glycogen is a hydrosoluble macromolecule with evenly distributed branching points. Starch exists as a water-insoluble particle having a defined (and evolutionary conserved) internal structure. The biochemistry of starch requires the co-operation of up to 40 distinct (iso) enzymes whilst approximately 10 (iso) enzymes permit glycogen metabolism. The biosynthesis and degradation of native starch include the transition of carbohydrates from the soluble to the solid phase and vice versa. In this review, two novel aspects of the eukaryotic plastidial starch degradation are discussed: Firstly, biochemical reactions that take place at the surface of particulate glucans and mediate the phase transition of carbohydrates. Secondly, processes that occur downstream of the export of starch-derived sugars into the cytosol. Degradation of transitory starch mainly results in the formation of neutral sugars, such as glucose and maltose, that are transported into the cytosol via the respective translocators. The cytosolic metabolism of the neutral sugars includes the action of a hexokinase, a phosphoglucomutase, and a transglucosidase that utilizes high molecular weight glycans a...|$|R

The Autonomous Province of Vojvodina is an autonomous province in Serbia, containing about 27 % {{of its total}} population according to the 2002 Census. It {{is located in the}} northern part of the country, in the Pannonia plain, in southeastern Europe. Vojvodina is an energy-deficient province. The incentives to invest human and financial resources in the research and development of cleaner bioprocesses are high, considering the benefits which might be achieved in terms of environment protection and manufacturing costs. In the near and medium tenu, the development of bioprocesses for waste recycling and resource recovery might be one of the most viable options, considering much research work has already been done. In Vojvodina, there are technological solutions that biofuels produced in a closed cycle, so that the quantity of waste reduced to a minimum. These solutions include the stillage (remainder after distillation) used for fattening cattle, and cattle excrement to produce biogas and manure as fertilizer. The energy required for the production of bioethanol is obtained combustion lignocelullose residual waste from the production of <b>basic</b> raw materials <b>starch,</b> or biogas. Ash from the burned biomass returned to soil as a source of minerals for plants and replacement of mineral fertilizer. Such a closed cycle is economical for small farms in Vojvodina.

40|$|Structurally {{composed}} of the glucose homopolymers amylose and amylopectin, starch is the main storage carbohydrate in vascular plants, and is synthesized in the plastids of both photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic cells. Its abundance as a naturally occurring organic compound is surpassed only by cellulose, and represents both a cornerstone for human and animal nutrition and a feedstock for many non-food industrial applications including production of adhesives, biodegradable materials, and first-generation bioethanol. This review provides {{an update on the}} different proposed pathways of starch biosynthesis occurring in both autotrophic and heterotrophic organs, and provides emerging information about the networks regulating them and their interactions with the environment. Special emphasis is given to recent findings showing that volatile compounds emitted by microorganisms promote both growth and the accumulation of exceptionally high levels of starch in mono- and dicotyledonous plants. We also review how plant biotechnologists have attempted to use <b>basic</b> knowledge on <b>starch</b> metabolism for the rational design of genetic engineering traits aimed at increasing starch in annual crop species. Finally we present some potential biotechnological strategies for enhancing starch content.

40|$|Twenty-eight White Leghorn laying hens, of the Cuban {{commercial}} hybrid L- 33, {{were used}} for eight weeks within the laying peak (36 to 43 weeks of age), to evaluate the meal of root of cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz) and the crude oil of African oil palm (Elaeis guineensis J.) as pigments of the egg yolks, out of their incorporation to the diet of laying hens during the laying peak. The birds were allocated in individual cages, with 108 g of feed/bird/d, water ad libitum, and 16 h of light. Analysis of variance was performed, according to one-way design with two treatments and fourteen repetitions (one cage with one hen). The treatments consisted of two diets (I- cassava meal + African palm oil, II- cassava meal + African oil palm + 2. 5 % of cassava foliage meal). The viability was of 100 % in all the treatments. No differences were found for laying (91. 59 and 90. 10 %), which surpassed the potential of this hybrid during the laying peak (90 %), feed conversion/egg (118 and 120 g of feed/egg), mass of egg produced (3071 and 3027 g/bird) and mass conversion (1. 98 and 2. 00). The pigmentation of the egg yolk was doubled, by adding 2. 5 % of meal of cassava foliage to the diets (3 and 6 in the scale of Roche). It was likeable to enhance the pigmentation of the egg yolk and reduce the feeding costs of the laying hens, when including 2. 5 % of meal of cassava foliage to diets where the cassava meal and the oil of the African oil palm are <b>basic</b> sources of <b>starch</b> and lipids for the laying hens...|$|R
