5|$|In roughly 1 out {{of every}} 100200people, the right {{inferior}} laryngeal nerve is nonrecurrent, <b>branching</b> <b>off</b> the vagus nerve around {{the level of the}} cricoid cartilage. Typically, such a configuration is accompanied by variation in the arrangement of the major arteries in the chest; most commonly, the right subclavian artery arises from {{the left side of the}} aorta and crosses behind the esophagus. A left nonrecurrent inferior laryngeal nerve is even more uncommon, requiring the aortic arch be on the right side, accompanied by an arterial variant which prevents the nerve from being drawn into the chest by the left subclavian.|$|E
5|$|The {{main roads}} within the BRWMU include Forest Road10, which runs {{for much of}} its length along {{the north side of}} the river. It links the {{community}} of Bull Run near the mouth of the river and Forest Road18 (Lolo Pass Road) east of Bull Run Lake. <b>Branching</b> <b>off</b> Forest Road 10 downstream of Reservoir2, Forest Roads12 and 14 form a loop south of the river. The loop extends as far east as Goodfellow Lakes, near the source of the Little Sandy River. Below the BRWMU, Bull Run Road, open to the public, crosses the river between the community of Bull Run and Dodge Park.|$|E

5|$|The major {{function}} of the lungs is gas exchange between the lungs and the blood. The alveolar and pulmonary capillary gases equilibrate across the blood–air barrier, a very thin diffusion membrane which is only, on average, about 2μm thick, consisting of {{the walls of the}} pulmonary alveoli, consisting of the alveolar epithelial cells, their basement membranes and the endothelial cells of the pulmonary capillaries. This membrane is folded into about 300 million small air sacs called alveoli (each between 75 and 300µm in diameter) <b>branching</b> <b>off</b> from the bronchioles in the lungs, thus providing an extremely large surface area (estimates varying between 70 and 145m2) for gas exchange to occur.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the {{accessory}} nerve {{is described as}} having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before <b>branching</b> <b>off</b> of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that {{in the majority of}} individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.|$|E
5|$|Every {{road that}} is {{maintained}} by DelDOT, including Interstate, U.S., and state routes, is assigned a maintenance road number (also {{known as a}} reference number). The maintenance road numbers are only unique in a specific county and some roads can be designated with multiple road numbers. For example, Bryants Corner Road in Kent County is designated as Road 205, Road 103, and Road 219. Suffixed maintenance road numbers exist near their parent roads, often for a short alignment. For example, Woodland Ferry Road in Sussex County is designated Road 78, while Old Sailor Road, a short road <b>branching</b> <b>off</b> from it near Laurel, is designated as Road 78A. The maintenance road numbers are signed with little white markers at intersections showing the two roads that intersect each other and on auxiliary plates below warning signs approaching intersections.|$|E
50|$|The road {{starts in}} Rise, where it <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> from County Road 820, and then crosses the low isthmus to Eidet, where County Road 917 <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> north to Grimstad. It then follows {{the sea to}} Sandvika, where it turns inland and runs along {{the west side of}} Bufjellet hill (211 m) before {{descending}} to Nykvåg, where County Road 916 <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> east to Vågen. The road then continues further along the water, past Malnes to Hovden, where it terminates.|$|R
50|$|Tracks <b>branch</b> <b>off</b> the Lübeck-Lüneburg line to {{the north}} of the Berlin-Hamburg route {{alongside}} the platform tracks including tracks for handling freight, which have now been largely dismantled. Several sidings also <b>branch</b> <b>off</b> from the Lübeck-Lüneburg {{line to the}} south of the Berlin-Hamburg line.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} fjord arms that <b>branch</b> <b>off</b> {{of the main}} Hardangerfjord. There are also certain {{sections}} of the main fjord that have special names. Below {{is a list of}} the sections of the fjord and the arms that <b>branch</b> <b>off</b> them.From west to east: ...|$|R
5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) than male individuals, {{which is also}} the case in other strombid gastropods such as the spider conch (Harpago chiragra) and queen conch (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that of}} the other members of the family: the animal has a long extensible snout and thin eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle <b>branching</b> <b>off</b> near the end. The large foot of the animal is narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion that is also found in other species of Strombidae (such as the queen conch).|$|E
5|$|The House of the Masks {{is named}} after the mosaic motif of theatre masks decorating ivy scrolls {{arranged}} in strips around a central surface area decorated in a cubic pattern. The more intricately decorated mosaics are found in four different rooms <b>branching</b> <b>off</b> from the peristyle courtyard paved with marble chips, with corridor mosaics utilizing amphora fragments. In the center of one mosaic is the figure of Dionysos riding a leopard against a similar black background to the mosaic in the House of Dionysos. Another central mosaic features a flute player and a dancing figure, the latter perhaps representing Silenus. Only the Dionysos figure employs the vermiculatum method. The other mosaics of the house fail to achieve the naturalism of finer figure scenes and motifs, but they nevertheless demonstrate an attempt at mimicking their illusionist qualities with the tesselated technique.|$|E
5|$|To {{function}} in gas exchange, lungs required a blood supply. In cartilaginous fishes and teleosts, the heart lies {{low in the}} body and pumps blood forward through the ventral aorta, which splits up in a series of paired aortic arches, each corresponding to a gill arch. The aortic arches then merge above the gills to form a dorsal aorta supplying the body with oxygenated blood. In lungfishes, bowfin and bichirs, the swim bladder is supplied with blood by paired pulmonary arteries <b>branching</b> <b>off</b> from the hindmost (6th) aortic arch. The same basic pattern is found in the lungfish Protopterus and in terrestrial salamanders, and was probably the pattern found in the tetrapods' immediate ancestors as well as the first tetrapods. In most other bony fishes the swim bladder is supplied with blood by the dorsal aorta.|$|E
50|$|The road <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> from County Road 820 at Skålbrekka {{and runs}} south. Klakksjordveien ('Klakksjord Road', {{formerly}} known as Veg 210 'Road 210') <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> {{to the east and}} connects to Klakksjorda on the northwest shore of Jørnfjord. The road then joins County Road 901 at Veanova.|$|R
50|$|The road to Taunggyi via Kalaw and Aungban <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> at Thazi {{from the}} main Yangon-Mandalay Road; another road via Ywangan and Pindaya <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> from Kyaukse south of Mandalay. The {{railhead}} stops short of Taunggyi at Shwe Nyaung, again from Thazi junction, and nearby Heho has an airport.|$|R
5000|$|The {{section in}} Ethelbert {{goes through the}} town, while PTH 10 {{bypasses}} it. It <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> PTH 10 just west of Ethelbert (PR 274 <b>branches</b> <b>off</b> this intersection {{in the opposite direction}} and travels south) and becomes Main St once inside the town until it intersects with Second Avenue.|$|R
