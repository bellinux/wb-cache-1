5000|$|In Britain, it {{is often}} found as a hybrid of <b>black</b> <b>knapweed,</b> Centaurea nigra. Unlike the <b>black</b> <b>knapweed,</b> the flower heads always {{look as if they}} are rayed, forming a more open star rather than a brush-like tuft.|$|E
50|$|Centaurea nigra is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the daisy family known by the common names lesser knapweed, common knapweed and <b>black</b> <b>knapweed.</b> A local vernacular name is hardheads.|$|E
50|$|Artificial {{fertilisers}} {{have never}} been used on this hay meadow, {{and it has not}} been ploughed for several hundred years. There are fifteen species of grass and diverse wild flowers, including <b>black</b> <b>knapweed,</b> lady's bedstraw and lady's smock, which is a food source for the orange tip butterfly.|$|E
50|$|This site is an {{unimproved}} hay meadow, {{which has}} around eighty flower species, such as green-winged orchids, yellow rattles, musk mallows and <b>black</b> <b>knapweeds.</b> Other plants include adder's tongue ferns.|$|R
50|$|On the south-facing {{slopes of}} the valley, {{adjacent}} to the SSSI, {{there are a number}} of traditionally managed hay meadows where various wildflowers are present, such as meadow buttercup (Ranunculus acris), oxeye daisy (Chrysanthemum leucanthemum), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), <b>black</b> <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea nigra), self-heal (Prunella vulgaris), red clover (Trifolium pratense), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), common eyebright (Euphrasia nemorosa), common cat’s ear (Hypochaeris radicata), and smooth hawksbeard (Crepis capillaris).|$|E
5000|$|To {{distinguish}} between similar plant communities {{dominated by the}} same species, other important species {{are included in the}} name which otherwise is formed according to the same rules. Another type of mesotrophic pastureland [...] - [...] also widespread in western Europe but dominated by <b>black</b> <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea nigra) and crested dog's-tail (Cynosurus cristatus) [...] - [...] is consequently named Centaureo-Cynosuretum cristati Br.-Bl. & Tx..|$|E
50|$|The site {{consists}} of meadows on the floodplain of the River Ray, {{and it is}} a stronghold for rare species because heavy clay soils and frequent flooding makes arable farming difficult. The meadows are managed by traditional farming methods, and areas of medieval ridge and furrow still survive. In the summer, drier areas have displays of wild flowers such as <b>black</b> <b>knapweed,</b> meadowsweet and tufted vetch. The site supports a small breeding population of lapwings and curlews, and the Trust has created many new ponds and ditches to assist birds and invertebrates.|$|E
50|$|It {{attracts a}} wide range of birds {{including}} marsh tit (Parus palustris), buzzard (Buteo buteo) and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The pasture is of a kind now rare in the area. In summer the site has a wide variety of flowers such as betony (Stachys), oxeye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare) and heath spotted orchid (Orchidaceae). In late summer, it is covered with drifts of <b>black</b> <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea) and devil's bit scabious (scabiosa). Many butterflies can be seen throughout the summer, including marsh fritillary (Euphydryas aurina), ringlet (Aphantopus hyperantus), gatekeeper (Pyronia tithonus) and marbled white (Melanargia galathea).|$|E
50|$|The site {{includes}} {{for many}} types of grasses, such as red fescue (Festuca rubra), perennial rye grass (Lolium perenne), meadow foxtail (Alopecurus pratensis), crested dog's tail (Cynosurus cristatus), yellow oatgrass (Trisetum flavescens), meadow brome (Bromus commutatus), and meadow barley (Hordeum brachyantherum). The meadow is also rich in various herbs including typical hayfield species pepper saxifrage (Silaum silaus), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis), <b>black</b> <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea nigra), adder's tongue (Ophioglossum vulgatum), common meadowrue (Thalictrum flavum), and ragged robin (Lychnis flos-cuculi). Other meadow flowers include for common knapweed (Centaurea nigra), meadow buttercup (Ranunculus acris), yellow rattle (Rhinanthus minor), cowslip (Primula veris), meadowsweet (Filipendula ulmaria), and ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare).|$|E
50|$|Human {{activity}} {{continued until}} relatively recent and is evident with 8 ha {{of the island}} surrounded by hedges and once cultivated. This area, with deeper soils, is dominated by bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) and still has relic pasture plants such as rye grass (Lolium perenne), red clover (Trifolium pratense), hop trefoil (Trifolium campestre) and <b>black</b> <b>knapweed</b> (Centaurea nigra). The maritime grassland around St Helen's Porth, and on the south coast, has abundant thrift (Armeria maritima) and sea campion (Silene maritime), and near Clodgie Point orange bird’s-foot occurs. The dune grassland area behind East and West Porth {{is important for the}} very rare dwarf pansy (Viola kitaibeliana). The summit of Great Hill has a small area of lowland heath.|$|E
40|$|The knapweeds {{comprise}} a diverse complex {{of species that}} predominantly infest rangelands in the western United States and Canada. This manual considers the biological control of six species of knapweeds: 1) spotted knapweed, 2) diffuse knapweed, 3) squarrose knapweed, 4) meadow knapweed, 5) <b>black</b> <b>knapweed,</b> and 6) brown knapweed. Spotted knapweed, Centaurea stoebe, {{is perhaps the most}} widespread species, followed in abundance by diffuse knapweed, C. diffusa. A third species, squarrose knapweed, C. virgata var. squarrosa, has a more limited distribution in the West. Three less widespread species, meadow (C. pratensis), brown (C. jacea) and <b>black</b> <b>knapweed</b> (C. nigra), are host to some of the same biocontrol agents and thus are included. Another well known species is Russian knapweed, Acroptilon repens (formerly known as C. repens). While a serious rangeland weed itself, Russian knapweed is not considered in this manual because it is sufficiently different from the other knapweeds to be considered separately and it has a unique complex of biocontrol agents...|$|E
40|$|Meadow Knapweed (Centaurea jacea x nigra) is a {{perennial}} plant that grows from a woody root crown. It is a fully fertile hybrid of Brown Knapweed (C. jacea) and <b>Black</b> <b>Knapweed</b> (C. nigra), and individuals can closely resemble either parent or may combine the characteristics randomly. The upright stems range from 20 to 40 inches tall, branching near the middle. Leaves grow to 6 {{inches long and}} 1 inches wide, edges are highly variable, ranging from smooth and entire to having lobes or teeth. Flowers are rose-purple, rising from round heads {{about the size of}} a nickel. Distinctive bracts surround the flower base, papery and rounded or dark and fringed, usually with both characteristics. In Thurston County, flowering can begin as early as May, with peaks in June and July. Flowering can continue into fall, especially on plants that have been mowed or damaged.
