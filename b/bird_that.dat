5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} (Pezophaps solitaria) is an extinct, flightless <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> was {{endemic to}} the island of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Genetically within the family of pigeons and doves, it was most {{closely related to the}} also extinct dodo of Mauritius, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae. The Nicobar pigeon is their closest living genetic relative.|$|E
5|$|The spill cleanup {{occurred}} during the nesting season for snowy plovers so special precautions were necessary while cleaning up tar balls. The birds are often found on the beaches {{along the coast of}} the Oxnard plain. Their nests are hard to see in the open sand and the birds are easily frightened away by human activity leaving the eggs to fast-moving predators such as sea gulls. Least terns were another endangered species of <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> was a concern during the cleanup efforts.|$|E
5|$|There are anecdotal {{reports of}} tame {{frigatebirds}} being kept across Polynesia and Micronesia in the Pacific. A <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> {{had come from}} one island and had been taken elsewhere could be reliably trusted to return to its original home, hence would {{be used as a}} speedy way to relay a message there. There is firmer evidence of this practice taking place in the Gilbert Islands and Tuvalu.|$|E

50|$|Lauraceae {{flowers are}} protogynous, {{often with a}} complex {{flowering}} system to prevent inbreeding. The fruits are an important food source for birds, on which some Palaeognathae are highly dependent. Other <b>birds</b> <b>that</b> rely heavily on the fruit for their diets include members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Ramphastidae, amongst others. <b>Birds</b> <b>that</b> are specialised frugivores tend to eat the whole fruit and regurgitate seeds intact, thereby releasing the seeds in favourable situations for germination (ornithochory). Some other <b>birds</b> <b>that</b> swallow the fruit pass the seed intact through their guts.|$|R
5|$|Believing {{that the}} wings were short and round, Gibbs thought {{the bird was}} not a strong flyer, and {{therefore}} not nomadic (periodically moving from place to place). In spite of the evidently longer wings which might have made it a strong flyer, vanGrouw also thought {{it would have been}} a sedentary (mostly staying at the same location) <b>bird,</b> <b>that</b> preferred not to fly across open water, similar to species in Ducula. It may have had a limited distribution on a small, remote island, which may explain why its provenance remains unknown.|$|E
5|$|By {{the fall}} 1998 {{annual meeting of}} the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology, held in Utah, United States, rumors were {{circulating}} about a striking fossil of a primitive <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> was in private hands. This fossil was presented by an anonymous dealer at a gem show in Tucson, Arizona. The Dinosaur Museum in Blanding, Utah, purchased it in February 1999. The museum is run by Stephen A. Czerkas and his wife, Sylvia Czerkas. Mr. Czerkas does not hold a university degree, but he is a dinosaur enthusiast and artist. He arranged for patrons of his museum, including trustee Dale Slade, to provide $80,000 for the purchase of the fossil, in order to study it scientifically and prevent it from disappearing into an anonymous private collection.|$|E
5|$|Colonies {{are usually}} {{situated}} on islands, cliffs or headlands, which land mammals have difficulty accessing. This {{is thought to}} provide protection to seabirds, which are often very clumsy on land. Coloniality often arises in types of <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> do not defend feeding territories (such as swifts, which have a very variable prey source); {{this may be a}} reason why it arises more frequently in seabirds. There are other possible advantages: colonies may act as information centres, where seabirds returning to the sea to forage can find out where prey is by studying returning individuals of the same species. There are disadvantages to colonial life, particularly the spread of disease. Colonies also attract the attention of predators, principally other birds, and many species attend their colonies nocturnally to avoid predation.|$|E

They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, interrupting Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the shirt is recovered as evidence.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the harsh}} winters, {{the park has}} few reptile and {{amphibian}} species with only one species of toad, three species of frog, one salamander species and two species of snakes that have been identified. At least 280 species of birds {{can be found in}} Banff including bald and golden eagles, red-tailed hawk, osprey, and merlin, all of which are predatory species. Additionally, commonly seen species such as the gray jay, American three-toed woodpecker, mountain bluebird, Clark's nutcracker, mountain chickadee and pipit are frequently found in the lower elevations. The white-tailed ptarmigan is a ground <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> is often seen in the alpine zones. Rivers and lakes are frequented by over a hundred different species including loon, heron and mallard which spend their summers in the park.|$|E
5|$|For {{more than}} 10 years, THSRC {{has been devoted}} to the {{preservation}} of the pheasant-tailed jacana, a type of <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> is considered endangered in Taiwan. With NT$50 million invested, the first artificial habitat recovery project was completed in collaboration with the local government, country development organizations and non-profit organizations. The pheasant-tailed jacana population in Tainan, Taiwan, which at one point numbered less than 50, has increased to over 300. In 2007, the recovery habitat was officially renamed “Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park” and since then, it has opened to the public. To educate students in matters concerning environmental protection, every year THSRC arranges for elementary and junior high school students to visit Pheasant-tailed Jacana Eco-Educational Nature Park(台南官田—水雉生態教育園區), where they are able to learn about the beauty of Taiwan’s natural habitats.|$|E

The British Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the egret from hunting for their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries. A more specialised organisation, the Wildfowl & Wetlands Trust, works to conserve waterfowl and their wetland habitats, with projects around the world.|$|E
5|$|Greco-Roman mythology {{described}} the Empusae, the Lamia, and the striges. Over time {{the first two}} terms became general words to describe witches and demons respectively. Empusa {{was the daughter of}} the goddess Hecate and was described as a demonic, bronze-footed creature. She feasted on blood by transforming into a young woman and seduced men as they slept before drinking their blood. The Lamia preyed on young children in their beds at night, sucking their blood, as did the gelloudes or Gello. Like the Lamia, the striges feasted on children, but also preyed on adults. They were described as having the bodies of crows or birds in general, and were later incorporated into Roman mythology as strix, a kind of nocturnal <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> fed on human flesh and blood.|$|E

5|$|Kite: As {{written in}} the Mozi, the Zhou Dynasty philosopher, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer Lu Ban (fl. 5th century BC) from the State of Lu created a wooden <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> remained flying {{in the air for}} three days, essentially a kite; there is written evidence that kites were used as rescue signals when the city of Nanjing was besieged by Hou Jing (died 552) during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502–549), while similar accounts of kites used for military signalling are found in the Tang (618–907) and Jin (1115–1234) dynasties; kite flying as a pastime can be seen in painted murals of Dunhuang dating to the Northern Wei (386–534) period, while descriptions of flying kites as a pastime have been found in Song (960–1279) and Ming (1368–1644) texts.|$|E
5|$|Many {{species of}} insects are toxic or distasteful {{when they have}} fed on certain plants that contain {{chemicals}} of particular classes, but not when they have fed on plants that lack those chemicals. For instance, some species of the subfamily Danainae feed on various species of the Asclepiadoideae in the family Apocynaceae, which render them poisonous and emetic to most predators. Such insects frequently are aposematically coloured and patterned. When feeding on innocuous plants however, they are harmless and nutritious, but a <b>bird</b> <b>that</b> once has sampled a toxic specimen is unlikely to eat harmless specimens that have the same aposematic coloration. When regarded as mimicry of toxic {{members of the same}} species, this too may be seen as automimicry.|$|E
