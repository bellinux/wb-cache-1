Attention has been given to the problems experienced by the <b>beginning</b> <b>teacher</b> when starting his teaching career in practice. His initial experience of the educational environment, as well as his development as person, educator, teacher and his position in the educational management situation are discussed. Due to the fact that he as an adult student exposes himself to an informal study situation to improve his teaching abilities, attention has been given to the specific qualities and problems the <b>beginning</b> <b>teacher</b> will be exposed to.
