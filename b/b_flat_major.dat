5|$|Author Robert Rodriguez {{writes that}} {{the content of the}} five loops has {{continued}} to invite debate among commentators, however, and that the manipulation applied to each of the recordings has made them impossible to decipher with authority. Based on the most widely held views, he says that, aside from McCartney's laughter and the <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> chord, the sounds were two loops of sitar passages, both reversed and sped up, and a loop of Mellotron string and brass voicings. In their book Recording the Beatles, Kevin Ryan and Brian Kehew list two loops of sitar recordings yet, rather than Mellotron, list a mandolin or acoustic guitar, treated with tape echo.|$|E

500|$|Both {{children}} {{were able to}} appear at the Oude Doelen on 22 January 1766, in a concert which may have included the first public performance of one of Wolfgang's London symphonies, K. 19, and possibly of a new symphony in <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> K. 22, composed in the Netherlands. Following this concert they spent time in Amsterdam before returning to The Hague early in March. The main reason for their return was the forthcoming public celebrations of the Prince of Orange's coming of age. Wolfgang had composed a quodlibet (song medley) for small orchestra and harpsichord, entitled Gallimathias musicum, K. 32, which was played at a special concert to honour the Prince on 11 March. This {{was one of several}} pieces composed for the occasion; Wolfgang also wrote arias for the Princess using words from Metastasio's libretto Artaserse (including Conservati fedele, K. 23), and keyboard variations on a Dutch song Laat ons juichen, Batavieren! K. 24. He wrote a set of keyboard and violin sonatas for the Princess, as he had earlier for the French princess and for the Queen of Great Britain. Another symphony, K. 45a, commonly known as [...] "Old Lambach" [...] and once thought to have been written several years later, was also written in The Hague, possibly for the Prince's coming-of-age concert.|$|E

50|$|Another verse {{featuring}} the same previous structure, and another kazoo solo {{in the same}} E major scale return again. This gives way to a chorus using the barre chord progression of D <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> G <b>flat</b> <b>major,</b> E <b>major,</b> <b>B</b> <b>major,</b> G <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> and D <b>flat</b> <b>major.</b> The chorus is in 6/8 time, but switches to one bar of 4/4 {{at the end of}} every chord progression, and four bars of 4/4 {{at the end of every}} chorus. Parker's vocals are heavily reverbed and delayed to give it a spacy atmosphere.|$|R
500|$|McCartney {{remembered that}} even though the song's harmony was mainly {{restricted}} to the chord of C, Martin accepted it as it was and said it was [...] "rather interesting". The song's harmonic structure is derived from Indian music and is based upon a high volume C drone played by Harrison on a tamboura. The [...] "chord" [...] over the drone is generally C major, but some changes to <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major</b> result from vocal modulations, as well as orchestral and guitar tape loops. The song has been called the first pop song that attempted to dispense with chord changes altogether. Here, the Beatles' harmonic ingenuity is nonetheless displayed in the upper harmonies – [...] "Turn off your mind", for example, is suitably a run of unvarying E melody notes, before [...] "relax" [...] involves an E–G melody note shift and [...] "float downstream" [...] an E–C–G descent. [...] "It is not dying" [...] involves a run of three G melody notes that rise on [...] "dying" [...] to a B, creating a VII/I (B/C) 'slash' polychord. [...] This is a prominent device in Beatles songs such as [...] "All My Loving", [...] "Help!", [...] "A Hard Day's Night", [...] "Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)", [...] "Hey Jude", [...] "Dear Prudence", [...] "Revolution" [...] and [...] "Get Back".|$|E

2500|$|The Sullivan scholar Gervase Hughes characterised Sir Roderic's song [...] "When {{the night}} wind howls" [...] as [...] "unquestionably the finest piece of {{descriptive}} music that Sullivan ever wrote, {{worthy of a}} place beside Schubert's Erlkönig, Wagner's overture to The Flying Dutchman, and well above Saint-Saëns' Danse macabre, {{all of which are}} tone-paintings in a similar colour. Although the vocal score gives not a hint of the uncanny brilliance of the orchestration, it demonstrates the sure footholds by which the music in a round dozen bars finds its way from D minor to A flat major and back and the shattering impact of the fortissimo chorus entry at an interrupted cadence on the chord of <b>B</b> <b>flat</b> <b>major.</b> The progressions that follow look to be unusual, but if we study them carefully we realise that here Sullivan is not feeling his way in unfamiliar territory. Rather we may find in these few bars an apotheosis of his matured harmonic resource." ...|$|E

He gave lessons in the Erfurt city conservatoire (in 1911–1921, composition and history of music), and honed his skills in conducting various choirs (the Erfurt Song Academy in 1914/15, the [...] "Riedelscher Gesangverein" [...] in Leipzig, and after 1918, the [...] "Engelbrechtscher Madrigalchor"). He also worked in composing choral music, a cappella, and orchestral accompaniments. Some of the most notable works of the period were the Song of Life (op. 29), Hyperion (op. 32) (after Friedrich Hölderlin) and a setting of the Third Psalm (op. 37). However, his mature style had not yet fully developed.
