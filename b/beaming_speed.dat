40|$|Context. We examine plasma thermalisation {{processes}} in the foreshock region of astrophysical shocks within a fully kinetic and self-consistent treatment. We concentrate on proton beam driven electrostatic processes, which are thought to {{play a key role}} in the beam relaxation and the particle acceleration. Our results have implications for the eﬀectiveness of electron surfing acceleration and the creation of the required energetic seed population for first order Fermi acceleration at the shock front. Aims. We investigate the acceleration of electrons via their interaction with electrostatic waves, driven by the relativistic Buneman instability, in a system dominated by counter-propagating proton beams. Methods. We adopt a kinetic Vlasov-Poisson description of the plasma on a fixed Eulerian grid and observe the growth and saturation of electrostatic waves for a range of proton beam velocities, from 0. 15 c to 0. 9 c. Results. We can report a reduced stability of the electrostatic wave (ESW) with increasing non-relativistic beam velocities and an improved wave stability for increasing relativistic beam velocities, both in accordance with previous findings. At the highest <b>beam</b> <b>speeds,</b> we find the system to be stable again for a period of ≈ 160 plasma periods. Furthermore, the high phase space resolution of the Eulerian Vlasov approach reveals processes that could not be seen previously with PIC simulations. We observe a, to our knowledge, previously unreported secondary electron acceleration mechanism at low <b>beam</b> <b>speeds.</b> We believe that it is the result of parametric couplings to produce high phase velocity ESW’s which then trap electrons, accelerating them to higher energies. This allows electrons in our simulation study to achieve the injection energy required for Fermi acceleration, for <b>beam</b> <b>speeds</b> as low as 0. 15 c in unmagnetised plasma. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the conditions under}} which parallel-propagating Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron (A/IC) waves and fast-magnetosonic/whistler (FM/W) waves are driven unstable by the differential flow and temperature anisotropy of alpha particles in the solar wind. We focus on the limit in which $w_{\parallel \alpha} \gtrsim 0. 25 v_{\mathrm A}$, where $w_{\parallel \alpha} $ is the parallel alpha-particle thermal speed and $v_{\mathrm A}$ is the Alfv\'en speed. We derive analytic expressions for the instability thresholds of these waves, which show, e. g., how the minimum unstable alpha-particle <b>beam</b> <b>speed</b> depends upon $w_{\parallel \alpha}/v_{\mathrm A}$, the degree of alpha-particle temperature anisotropy, and the alpha-to-proton temperature ratio. We validate our analytical results using numerical solutions to the full hot-plasma dispersion relation. Consistent with previous work, we find that temperature anisotropy allows A/IC waves and FM/W waves to become unstable at significantly lower values of the alpha-particle <b>beam</b> <b>speed</b> $U_\alpha$ than in the isotropic-temperature case. Likewise, differential flow lowers the minimum temperature anisotropy needed to excite A/IC or FM/W waves relative to the case in which $U_\alpha = 0 $.

40|$|An {{ion beam}} can destabilize Alfvén/ion-cyclotron waves and magnetosonic/whistler waves if the <b>beam</b> <b>speed</b> is {{sufficiently}} large. Numerical solutions of the hot-plasma dispersion relation have previously {{shown that the}} minimum <b>beam</b> <b>speed</b> required to excite such instabilities is significantly smaller for oblique modes with k⃗×B⃗_ 0 ≠ 0 than for parallel-propagating modes with k⃗×B⃗_ 0 = 0, where k⃗ is the wavevector and B⃗_ 0 is the background magnetic field. In this paper, we explain this difference {{within the framework of}} quasilinear theory, focusing on low-β plasmas. We begin by deriving, in the cold-plasma approximation, the dispersion relation and polarization properties of both oblique and parallel-propagating waves in the presence of an ion beam. We then show how the instability thresholds of the different wave branches can be deduced from the wave [...] particle resonance condition, the conservation of particle energy in the wave frame, the sign (positive or negative) of the wave energy, and the wave polarization. We also provide a graphical description of the different conditions under which Landau resonance and cyclotron resonance destabilize Alfvén/ion-cyclotron waves in the presence of an ion beam. We draw upon our results to discuss the types of instabilities that may limit the differential flow of alpha particles in the solar wind. Comment: 12 pages, 10 figure...|$|R

The beam {{emerges from a}} nozzle near {{the tip of a}} hollow rotor which can be spun at high-speed to shift the molecular velocity distribution downward or upward over a wide range. Here we consider mostly the slowing mode. Introducing a pulsed gas inlet system, cryocooling, and a shutter gate eliminated the main handicap of the original device, in which continuous gas flow imposed high background pressure. The new version provides intense pulses, of duration 0. 1 - 0. 6 ms (depending on rotor speed) and containing ~ 10 ^ 12 molecules at lab speeds as low as 35 m/s and ~ 10 ^ 15 molecules at 400 m/s. Beams of any molecule available as a gas can be slowed (or speeded); e. g., we have produced slow and fast beams of rare gases, O 2, Cl 2, NO 2, NH 3, and SF 6. For collision experiments, the ability to scan the <b>beam</b> <b>speed</b> by merely adjusting the rotor is especially advantageous when using two merged beams.

Potentiodynamic and potentiostatic tests were applied on EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V in 3. 5 % mass NaCl solution, {{to determine the}} pitting potential and critical pitting temperature (CPT). A relation between pitting potential and temperature was established for EBM Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy by conducting potentiodynamic test under different temperatures from room temperature until 83 ?C. Critical pitting temperature was also measured in 3. 5 % mass NaCl solution of different pH of 2. 0, 5. 7 and 10. 0, to {{examine the effect of}} aggressive conditions on the pitting corrosion of EBM alloy. Moreover, the same tests were performed on wrought Ti- 6 Al- 4 V for comparison purposes. The results showed that EBM alloy maintained its corrosion resistance as it had the same pitting potential of wrought alloy even at higher temperatures. EBM alloy did not pit when performing potentiostatic test at 800 mV vs. Saturated Calomel Electrode (SCE) even under different pH of the solution. Due to the manufacturing technique and conditions of the EBM machine, the resulted object has irregularities on the exterior surface and voids that are formed within the part which affects samples? properties like surface roughness, CPT, density and porosity. In this study, a statistically designed experiment was employed to manufacture Ti- 6 Al- 4 V samples in EBM machine under different process parameters of <b>beam</b> current, <b>beam</b> <b>speed</b> and offset focus. Surface roughness was measured for as-built samples. Then, a potentiostatic test was conducted under 2. 40 V vs. SCE to determine the critical pitting temperature in 3. 5 % mass NaCl solution for the same samples of different processing parameters. Moreover, density was measured and porosity was calculated from density values. Finally, a model equation was established in order to relate EBM?s process parameters to measured properties of surface roughness, CPT, density and porosity.

30|$|This {{apparently}} surprising {{result can}} be explained by the opening mechanisms of both valves, and the operation principles of the Stark decelerator. The NPV is activated using only small voltages, and a moderate power of about 1 W is dissipated in the valve. This results in only a modest change of the <b>beam’s</b> mean <b>speed</b> during the opening of the valve, i.e., the beam that is formed when the valve just opens is about the same as the mean speed that is found at later times. This behavior is very different for the JV. Here, large currents are needed to open the valve, resulting in significant power dissipation (about 20 W) and a hot valve body. Moreover, as the valve opens, gas flows through the hot current conductors, locally cooling the conductors. As a result, the mean <b>speed</b> of the <b>beam</b> shows a strong gradient during the valve opening time [42]. When the valve just opens, the beam is very fast.
