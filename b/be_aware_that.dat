5|$|On 26 April, Babli's family filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Manoj and {{his family}} for {{kidnapping}} Babli. On 15 June, Manoj went to court with Babli, testifying that they had married in conformity with the law {{and that he did}} not kidnap Babli. The judge ordered police protection for the two. Chandrapati did not attend the trial so that Babli's family would not <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> Manoj and Babli were in town.|$|E
5|$|André conferred with General Clinton, {{who gave}} him broad {{authority}} to pursue Arnold's offer. André then drafted instructions to Stansbury and Arnold. This initial letter opened a discussion on the types of assistance and intelligence that Arnold might provide, and included instructions for how to communicate in the future. Letters were to be passed through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> some letters contained instructions that were to {{be passed on to}} André, written in both code and invisible ink, using Stansbury as the courier.|$|E
5|$|During the half-time interval, Stein gave also Gordon Strachan {{notice that}} he planned to bring him off during the second half and replace him with winger Davie Cooper. Stein's five-man {{defensive}} set-up meant that his midfielders were outnumbered by the Welsh, and consequently Strachan had failed to make an impact on the game up to then. Despite this, Strachan was prepared to argue with Stein that he should remain on, until Alex Ferguson cautioned him to <b>be</b> <b>aware</b> <b>that</b> the manager was clearly not well, and should not cause too much stress with a confrontation.|$|E
