Wrote one Plain Dealer columnist, Franklin Lewis: [...] "He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates... He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in his league." [...] Doby responded, [...] "I was looked on as a Black man, not as a human being.

In an interview with MTV News, Ciara went into detail about the setup of the performance, stating: [...] "I just kind of felt cool, 'cause Justin can play [...] real well and he really gets into the music and it was, like, 'Hey, let's make you part of the band.'

In a detailed review regarding the storyline, Canning wrote, [...] "Kurt finally got the first kiss he deserved. Too bad it came from the wooden, glass-eyed Blaine. Chris Colfer has been in the running for performance awards for good reason. Darren Criss will not be. Colfer and his character deserve better than the cardboard, unemotional declaration of love that Criss delivered.

In his review, Poniewozik wrote, [...] "As for the at-long-last kiss, it's to Glees credit that it made me think, ‘Finally, Blaine and Kurt are locking lips already!’ before it made me think, ‘Look, an honest-to-God gay kiss, between two men, on my primetime TV show!’" [...] Aly Semigran of MTV praised the interaction between Kurt and Blaine, saying that the kiss scene was a [...] "sweet, real and, shockingly, un-hyped moment". Semigran went on to praise the acting in the scene, saying that both actors [...] "handled it with dignity and honesty". Brett Berk deemed the interaction to be [...] "appropriately fervid".|$|E

In a list compiled by VH1 in 2001, it was listed at number ninety in the best videos of all time. The video was the first of fourteen of her videos to retire on MTV's television series TRL. On its final episode, a three-hour special aired on November 16, 2008, [...] "…Baby One More Time" [...] was number one in their final countdown as the most iconic music videos of all time and was the last video to be played on the show. Wesley Yang in his essay [...] "Inside the Box" [...] in n+1, compared the music video to Britny Fox's [...] "Girlschool" [...] because it featured [...] "a classroom full of Catholic schoolgirls gyrating to the beat in defiance of a stern teacher. [...] <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> sexist video by a horrible hair metal band that exploited women. Britney Spears was something else—an inflection point in the culture". The music video is also referenced in the music video of Spears's 2000 single, [...] "Stronger" [...] where Spears sings, [...] "My loneliness ain't killing me no more" [...] - a reference to [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] where she sings, [...] "My loneliness is killing me." [...] The music video is also referenced in the 2009 single, [...] "If U Seek Amy".

It could not be more inaccurate in terms of procedure, the way they talk or the way they dress. In all the time I was in the CID in the 1970s I never saw a copper in a leather bomber jacket and I never heard an officer call anyone 'guv'.... Actually, there were a few police officers in London who started to behave like Regan and Carter in The Sweeney, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> case of life following art, not the other way round". The journalist who interviewed Stalker, Ray King, remarks that the depiction of the police can be defended if we assume that Sam is indeed in a coma and that we are seeing his imaginary idea of 1973, filtered through 1970s cop shows.|$|E
2500|$|The core {{principle}} of The Colbert Report is that Colbert is a [...] "well-intentioned, poorly informed, high-status idiot." [...] The character {{believes that he}} himself is the news: rather than a vessel to deliver the news to the audience, or a general member of the media, the character sees himself as {{more important than the}} news. He is veracious in his approach, while often ridiculously overblown in his statements. The character is egomaniacal, fact-averse ("factose intolerant"), God-fearing, and hyper-patriotic. He claims to be an independent who is often mistaken for a Republican, but uniformly despises liberals and generally agrees with the actions and decisions of the Republican Party. Colbert's character {{has been described as a}} [...] "caustic right-wing bully". The character exists not in opposition to political leaders, but to common ignorances; for example, his insistence that then-presidential candidate Barack Obama had Socialist leanings was based on public misconceptions. In parodying the cult of personality, the Colbert character also developed a real-life equivalent, creating what was dubbed the [...] "Colbert Nation". While giving the character a certain mythos was part of the show's inception, show producers did not set out to create a loyal following; the joke was that the character thought he had an influence, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> figment of his ego-riddled imagination.|$|E

It was. Later you found out that was not a real good idea. But that's the way I was thinking back then.". [...] After retiring from coaching, Spurrier further reflected on his NFL stint in several interviews. In a 2016 appearance on the Paul Finebaum Show, Spurrier reflected that the Redskins might not have been the best choice for his jump to the NFL. [...] "I went to the team that offered the most money instead of the best situation", he said. And in 2015, he told David Feherty that, [...] "The owner and the personnel guys, they picked the team. I couldn’t even pick the quarterback the second year. So I knew it wasn’t going to work, but that's ok.

2500|$|Several {{scholars}} have explored the so-called [...] "golden age" [...] of the Maritimes {{in the years}} just before Confederation. In Nova Scotia, the population grew steadily from 277,000 in 1851 to 388,000 in 1871, mostly from natural increase since immigration was slight. The era {{has been called a}} golden age, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> myth created in the 1930s to lure tourists to a romantic era of tall ships and antiques. Recent historians using census data have shown that is a fallacy. In 1851–1871 there was an overall increase in per capita wealth holding. However most of the gains went to the urban elite class, especially businessmen and financiers living in Halifax. The wealth held by the top 10% rose considerably over the two decades, but there was little improvement in the wealth levels in rural areas, which comprised the great majority of the population. Likewise Gwyn reports that gentlemen, merchants, bankers, colliery owners, shipowners, shipbuilders, and master mariners flourished. However the great majority of families were headed by farmers, fishermen, craftsmen and laborers. Most of them—and many widows as well—lived in poverty. Out migration became an increasingly necessary option. Thus the era was indeed a golden age but only for a small but powerful and highly visible elite.|$|E
