Due to walnut heterozygosity, propagation by seeds does not lead to inheritance of all the characteristics of certain varieties. That is the reason why propagation technologies are being improved worldwide. The purpose of this experiment was to increase the success of inoculation of the walnut <b>budding</b> var. Franquete. Methods such as the patch <b>budding</b> and chip <b>budding</b> have been employed during the experiment. To establish the most appropriate season of inoculation, June <b>budding</b> on 28 June (with <b>buds</b> taken in the current season), autumn <b>budding</b> on 28 August (with <b>buds</b> taken in the current season) and spring <b>budding</b> on 28 May (with <b>buds</b> collected from the winter dormant period), were tested.

40|$|Taste <b>buds</b> are the {{peripheral}} sensory organs of the gustatory system. They occur in all taxa of vertebrates and are pear-shaped intra-epithelial organs of about 80 microm height and 50 microm width. Taste <b>buds</b> mainly consist of specialized epithelial cells, which synapse at their bases and therefore are secondary sensory cells. Taste <b>buds</b> {{have been described}} based on studies of teleostean species, {{but it turned out}} that the ultrastructure of teleostean taste <b>buds</b> may differ between distinct systematic groups and that this description is not representative of those taste <b>buds</b> in other main taxa of fishes, such as selachians, holosteans and dipnoans. Furthermore, it is not known how variable the micromorphologies of non-teleostean taste <b>buds</b> are. For this reason the taste <b>buds</b> of two holosteans, Lepisosteus oculatus and Amia calva, were investigated and compared. While in both species the taste <b>buds</b> are of the same shapes and sizes, the cellular components of their sensory epithelia differ: in Lepisosteus taste <b>buds</b> comprise two types of elongated light cells and one type of dark cells. In contrast, Amia taste <b>buds</b> contain only one type of light, but two types of dark elongated cells. Afferent synapses are common in the <b>buds</b> of both species, efferent synapses occur only in Lepisosteus taste <b>buds.</b> These differences show that even in the small group of holostean fishes the taste <b>buds</b> are differently organized.

40|$|Tumor <b>budding,</b> a {{histological}} {{hallmark of}} epithelial-mesenchymal transition in colorectal cancer, is a parameter of tumor progression {{and according to}} the International Union Against Cancer/American Joint Committee on Cancer an 'additional' prognostic factor. The current definition of tumor <b>budding</b> is reserved for the invasive tumor front of colorectal cancer (so called peri-tumoral <b>budding),</b> but tumor <b>buds</b> can also be observed in small preoperative biopsy specimens. Whereas the prognostic value of peri-tumoral <b>budding</b> assessed in resection specimens has found wide acceptance, the value of <b>budding</b> in preoperative biopsies, which normally do not encompass the invasive tumor margin and hence can be called intra-tumoral <b>budding,</b> has not been systematically investigated yet. Therefore, the aim {{of this study is to}} assess the predictive value of intra-tumoral <b>budding</b> for lymph node and distant metastasis in preoperative biopsies. Preoperative biopsy samples and consecutive resection specimens from 72 patients with pathological information on TNM stage, vascular, lymphatic and perineural invasion, and tumor border configuration were used to evaluate intra-tumoral <b>budding</b> and peri-tumoral <b>budding.</b> Both parameters were scored semiquantitatively as 'high' (detectable at low power magnification × 2. 5) and 'low' (occasional <b>budding</b> at intermediate magnification × 10, difficult to find or absent). In biopsy samples high intra-tumoral <b>budding</b> was observed in 12 / 72 patients (17 %) and associated with high peri-tumoral <b>budding</b> in the corresponding resection specimens (P= 0. 008). Additionally, there was a correlation between high intra-tumoral <b>budding</b> and lymph node metastasis (P= 0. 034), distant metastasis (P= 0. 007) and higher tumor grade (P= 0. 025). Peri-tumoral <b>budding</b> was associated with higher N stage (P= 0. 004), vascular (P= 0. 046) and lymphatic invasion (P= 0. 019) as well as with an infiltrating tumor border (P< 0. 001), reflecting the predictive power of peri-tumoral <b>budding</b> for tumor progression. High intra-tumoral <b>budding</b> in preoperative biopsy samples of colorectal cancer patients predicts high peri-tumoral <b>budding</b> at the invasive margin and lymph node metastasis in the corresponding resection specimens as well as distant metastasis...|$|R
40|$|In {{colorectal}} cancer, tumor <b>budding</b> at the invasive front (peritumoral <b>budding)</b> is {{an established}} prognostic parameter and decreased in mismatch repair-deficient tumors. In contrast, the clinical relevance of tumor <b>budding</b> within the tumor center (intratumoral <b>budding)</b> {{is not yet}} known. The aim {{of the study was}} to determine the correlation of intratumoral <b>budding</b> with peritumoral <b>budding</b> and mismatch repair status and the prognostic impact of intratumoral <b>budding</b> using 2 independent patient cohorts. Following pancytokeratin staining of whole-tissue sections and multiple-punch tissue microarrays, 2 independent cohorts (group 1 : n = 289; group 2 : n = 222) with known mismatch repair status were investigated for intratumoral <b>budding</b> and peritumoral <b>budding.</b> In group 1, intratumoral <b>budding</b> was strongly correlated to peritumoral <b>budding</b> (r = 0. 64; P <. 001) and less frequent in mismatch repair-deficient versus mismatch repair-proficient cases (P =. 177). Sensitivity and specificity for lymph node positivity were 72. 7 % and 72. 1 %. In mismatch repair-proficient cancers, high-grade intratumoral <b>budding</b> was associated with right-sided location (P =. 024), advanced T stage (P =. 001) and N stage pN (P <. 001), vascular invasion (P =. 041), infiltrating tumor margin (P =. 003), and shorter survival time (P =. 014). In mismatch repair-deficient cancers, high intratumoral <b>budding</b> was linked to higher tumor grade (P =. 004), vascular invasion (P =. 009), infiltrating tumor margin (P =. 005), and more unfavorable survival time (P =. 09). These associations were confirmed in group 2. High-grade intratumoral <b>budding</b> was a poor prognostic factor in univariate (P <. 001) and multivariable analyses (P =. 019) adjusting for T stage, N stage distant metastasis, and adjuvant therapy. These preliminary results on 511 patients show that intratumoral <b>budding</b> is an independent prognostic factor, supporting the future investigation of intratumoral <b>budding</b> in larger series of both preoperative and postoperative rectal and colon cancer specimens...|$|R
40|$|Background : Tumor <b>budding</b> is a histopathologic entity {{refers to}} small cluster of cancer cells at the {{invasive}} edge of tumor. It {{was assumed that}} tumor <b>budding</b> is linked to epithelial-mesenchymal transition, an early event in metastasis. Objective: This study aimed {{to find out the}} correlation of tumor <b>budding</b> with E-cadherin and MMP- 9 expression and risk of metastasis in breast carcinoma. Method: We investigated 35 cases breast carcinoma with metastasis and 35 cases without metastasis. The number of tumor <b>budding</b> was counted in cytokeratin-stained slides with 400 x magnification (0. 57 mm 2). Result: Cut-off point by ROC analysis was 11 and the patient was categorized into low grade (0 - 10 <b>buds)</b> and high grade (11 or more <b>buds)</b> tumor <b>budding.</b> Inter-observer agreement was good with K value 0. 914. Low level of E-cadherin was not significantly correlated with high grade tumor <b>budding</b> (p= 0. 660), meanwhile high level of MMP- 9 was significantly correlated with high grade tumor <b>budding</b> (p= 0. 001). High grade tumor <b>budding</b> was a significant, independent risk factor of metastasis in breast carcinoma (OR= 38. 2, 95 % CI 7. 5 - 193. 7, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: In conclusion, tumor <b>budding</b> grade is related to level of MMP- 9 but has no correlation E-cadherin expression. High grade tumor <b>budding</b> is an independent risk factor of metastasis in breast carcinoma. </p...|$|R

There were significant associations between NTB and cliniopathologic parameters such as tumor depth, nodal metastasis and clinical stage. Expres-sion of cytoplasmic and nuclear b-catenin were significantly higher at tumor <b>budding</b> sites than in the tumor center. In contrast, expression of membranous and cytoplasmic E-cadherin were significantly higher in the tumor center than at the tumor <b>budding</b> sites.
