5|$|Fluorosurfactants {{are small}} organofluorine {{molecules}} used for repelling water and stains. Although expensive (comparable to pharmaceuticals at $200–2000 per kilogram), they yielded over $1 <b>billion</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> revenues by 2006; Scotchgard alone generated over $300 million in 2000. Fluorosurfactants are {{a minority in}} the overall surfactant market, most of which is taken up by much cheaper hydrocarbon-based products. Applications in paints are burdened by compounding costs; this use was valued at only $100 million in 2006.|$|E
5|$|Organofluorides consume over 20% of mined {{fluorite}} {{and over}} 40% of hydrofluoric acid, with refrigerant gases dominating and fluoropolymers increasing their market share. Surfactants are a minor application but generate over $1 <b>billion</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> revenue. Due {{to the danger}} from direct hydrocarbon–fluorine reactions above −150°C (−240°F), industrial fluorocarbon production is indirect, mostly through halogen exchange reactions such as Swarts fluorination, in which chlorocarbon chlorines are substituted for fluorines by hydrogen fluoride under catalysts. Electrochemical fluorination subjects hydrocarbons to electrolysis in hydrogen fluoride, and the Fowler process treats them with solid fluorine carriers like cobalt trifluoride.|$|E
5|$|Low {{back pain}} results in large {{economic}} costs. In the United States, {{it is the}} most common type of pain in adults, responsible for a large number of missed work days, and is the most common musculoskeletal complaint seen in the emergency department. In 1998, it was estimated to be responsible for $90 <b>billion</b> <b>in</b> <b>annual</b> health care costs, with 5% of individuals incurring most (75%) of the costs. Between 1990 and 2001 there was a more than twofold increase in spinal fusion surgeries in the US, despite the fact that there were no changes to the indications for surgery or new evidence of greater usefulness. Further costs occur in the form of lost income and productivity, with low back pain responsible for 40% of all missed work days in the United States. Low back pain causes disability in a larger percentage of the workforce in Canada, Great Britain, the Netherlands and Sweden than in the US or Germany.|$|E
