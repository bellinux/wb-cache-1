The modifications produced discard reductions of around 60 % (by number) and have been used on a continuous commercial basis {{for more than a year}} by the competition winner. All <b>beam</b> <b>trawls</b> used in the UK <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet are similar in design, but we demonstrate that the modifications outlined here may not be universally acceptable across the whole <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet, primarily because of the diversity in species targeted.

40|$|The project WAKO {{wants to}} give a first attempt to map the current {{knowledge}} and the knowledge gaps {{on the effects of}} trammel net and <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries for the Belgian part of the North Sea. The project focuses on three ecosystem components, i. e. benthic invertebrates, sea birds and marine mammals. The aim of this project consists of three phases: (1) compilation and analysis of existing, experimental data for the Belgian part of the North Sea on the effects of trammel net and <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries; (2) current knowledge on the impact of <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> and trammel/gill net fisheries, based on literature review and (3) evaluation of the direct effects of <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> and trammel/gill net fisheries on three ecosystem components, knowledge gaps and investigation of an appropriate methodology to evaluate the environmental impact of fishing gears. WAKO indicates that direct, short-term effects of trammel net and <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fisheries are clearly directed to different ecosystem components. Similarities between analogous, scientific studies allow a first evaluation of the effects, but quantitative data (on both biological impact data and data related to fishing effort and distribution) are so far insufficient to allow the development of a decision support tool for environmental and fisheries management...|$|R

Landings of plaice and sole are significantly lower in the pulse trawl {{when compared to the}} conventional <b>beam</b> <b>trawl.</b> 2. There {{was no significant difference in}} the catch rates of undersized (discard) plaice between the pulse trawl and the conventional trawl. 3.

The catch rates of benthic fauna (nrs/hr of Astropecten irregularis, Asterias rubens, and Liocarcinus holsatus) were significantly lower in the pulse trawl compared to the conventional <b>beam</b> <b>trawl.</b> 5. There are indications that undersized plaice are damaged to a lesser degree in the pulse trawl and will survive better in the pulse trawl. Based on previous research, these results would indicate a survival rate of plaice in the pulse trawl that is twice as high as in a conventional <b>beam</b> <b>trawl.</b> But since the method of determining damage to fish by visual observation is subjective, this conclusion should be treated with caution...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet that {{operates}} in the centre-north of Portugal, and aims to estimate the technical efficiency of this in 2004 and to assess the technical efficiency change, the technical change of production technology and total factor productivity change for the period ranging from 1995 to 2004. The efficiency of the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet in 2004 was estimated, with parametric methods. To obtain the frontier form of production possibilities, we used the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) Technique. The evolution of efficiency was based in non-parametric methods namely the Malmquist Index, {{which is based on}} Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) techniques. The results indicated that the technical efficiency of the Portuguese <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet was relatively low. It was observed that the output depends positively and significantly of the engine power and the number of days at sea. The results showed a slightly decrease in the total factors productivity. This is a symptom of some inefficiency of the artisanal fishing sector, which has a greater role in social terms than in the economic ones. Technical efficiency grew slightly between 1995 and 2004, whereas technological change decreased, indicating that the <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> fleet had technological losses during the studied period. The conjugated effect of these two measures lead to a small decrease of the total factors productivity.

40|$|Ecosystem-based fishery {{management}} requires that both a fishery {{and the environment}} associated with that fishery should be sustainable. <b>Beam</b> <b>trawling</b> has widespread effects on the biomass, production and diversity of benthic communities and in some fisheries, the impact is deleterious. Beam trawls impact benthic communities because the ground gear crushes and dislodges animals on the seabed, and because animals {{are caught in the}} trawl and subsequently die. Based on a study of the relative performance of seven designs of benthic release panels in commercial beam trawl fisheries, we demonstrate that panel designs consisting of 150 mm × 5 mm ø double polyethylene square mesh or 150 mm × 6 mm ø single polyethylene square mesh, respectively, reduced invertebrate bycatches by 75 and 80 %, and that > 90 % of the animals released survived.

The research was carried out in the northern part of the Dutch Voordelta (southern North Sea coastal zone area, 15 – 22 m deep, sandy habitat) in June 2013. In this experimental area, fishing disturbance was considered to be low so interference with the experiment was minimalized. Within the experimental area 3 sub-areas (150 m x 1000 m) were established for the BACI experiment: 1) a pulse trawl area; 2) a <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> area; 3) a reference area. The pulse and <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> areas of the BACI experiment were trawled by a commercial vessel (pulse) and a research vessel (beam) for one day.

40|$|Demands for {{management}} advice on mixed and multispecies fisheries pose many challenges, {{further complicated by}} corresponding requests for advice on {{the environmental impacts of}} alternate management options. Here, we develop, and apply to North Sea fisheries, a method for collectively assessing the effects of, and interplay between, technical interactions, multispecies interactions, and the environmental effects of fishing. Ecological interactions involving 21 species are characterized with an ensemble of 188 plausible parameterizations of size-based multispecies models, and four fleets (<b>beam</b> <b>trawl,</b> otter trawl, industrial, and pelagic) characterized with catch composition data. We use the method to evaluate biomass and economic yields, alongside the risk of stock depletion and changes in the value of community indicators, for 10 000 alternate fishing scenarios (combinations of rates of fishing mortality F and fleet configuration) and present the risk vs. reward trade-offs. Technical and multispecies interactions linked to the <b>beam</b> and otter <b>trawl</b> fleets were predicted to have the strongest effects on fisheries yield and value, risk of stock collapse and fish community indicators. Increasing <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> effort led to greater increases in <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> yield when otter trawl effort was low. If otter trawl effort was high, increases in <b>beam</b> <b>trawl</b> effort led to reduced overall yield. Given the high value of demersal species, permutations of fleet effort leading to high total yield (generated primarily by pelagic species) were not the same as permutations leading to high catch values. A transition from F for 1990 to 2010 to FMSY, but without changes in fleet configuration, reduced risk of stock collapse without affecting long-term weight or value of yield. Our approach directly addresses the need for assessment methods that treat mixed and multispecies issues collectively, address uncertainty, and take account of trade-offs between weight and value of yield, state of stocks and state of the environment...|$|R

A total of 38 gear tests were conducted in which modified beam trawls were compared in pair with a conventional 12 m beam trawl. The modifications consisted of a T 90 aft part and various Square Mesh Panels (SMPs) in the bottom sheet, top sheet and combinations of both, and variations of a Benthos Release Hole with a guiding V-panel in the bottom sheet. It was found that a panel in the bottom sheet with 160 mm mesh size appeared to perform best without releasing too many marketable fish. The panel should extend relatively far aft {{just in front of}} the codend here the netting is offground. Panels placed only in the top sheet are not very suitable in reducing benthos ycatches. In addition the Benthos Release Hole with guiding device seems to be effective in reducing such bycatches.
