5|$|Before {{the reign}} of Henry VIII, the {{sovereign}} always granted his or her assent in person. The sovereign, wearing the Imperial State Crown, would be seated on the throne in the Lords chamber, surrounded by heralds {{and members of the}} royal court—a scene that nowadays is repeated only at the annual State Opening of Parliament. The Commons, led by their speaker, would listen from the Bar of the Lords, just outside the chamber. The Clerk of the Parliaments presented the <b>bills</b> <b>awaiting</b> assent to the monarch, save that supply bills were traditionally brought up by the speaker. The Clerk of the Crown, standing on the sovereign's right, then read aloud the titles of the bills (in earlier times, the entire text of the bills).

5000|$|In the {{original}} deed, John Dyckson {{is described as}} a [...] "Caryer", which in the West Midlands at this time, when roads were nothing more than hollow-ways and bridle paths, implied that he owned several trains of pack-horses.

40|$|The {{systematic}} {{status of}} three nominal {{forms of the}} Colombian characid genus Nematobrycon is herein treated. All forms are illustrated and their interrelationships discussed. One species, Nematobrycon lacortei is described as new. Nematobrycon palmeri Eigenmann, a species from the northern headwaters of the Rio San Juan is compared with Nematobrycon amphiloxus Eigenmann & Wilson from the adjacent headwaters of the Rio Atrato. It is suggested that N. amphiloxus is probably a subspecies of N. palmeri. N. lacortei from {{the headwaters of the}} Rio Calima, a large southern tributary of the Rio San Juan, is considered specifically distinct from N. palmeri at the present time. Judgement on the systematic status of all forms of Nematobrycon must <b>await</b> <b>collection</b> of population samples from the headwaters of many uncollected tributaries of the Rio San Juan and Rio Atrato.

40|$|Macadamias are {{generally}} harvested {{from the ground}} in Australia. The duration of nut fall varies from {{a few weeks to}} several months depending on cultivar and growing conditions. This has economic consequences for the grower since several passes may be required for harvesting the crop. The quality of nuts may also deteriorate on the tree prior to nut fall or on the ground <b>awaiting</b> <b>collection.</b> Summaries of the past three years research examining several factors related to nut fall and harvesting will be presented. This will include morphological description of the tissues that separate to allow nut fall. Differences in the period between nuts reaching maturity and unaided nut fall will be shown for a range of cultivars from different locations. The period during nut development when Ethrel promotes drop will be identified and the effect of different doses on nut fall will be described. The longer-term effects of both tree shaking and treatment with Ethrel on the return yields will be described. Options for promoting nut drop and improving harvest scheduling in light of these results will be discussed...|$|R

On 3 May, all of JG 1's surviving He 162s were restructured into two groups, I. Einsatz ("Combat") and II. Sammel ("Collection"). All JG 1's aircraft were grounded on 5 May, when General Admiral Hans-Georg von Friedeburg signed the surrender of all German armed forces in the Netherlands, Northwest Germany and Denmark. On 6 May, when the British reached their airfields, JG 1 turned their He 162s over to the Allies, and examples were shipped to the U.S., Britain, France, and the Soviet Union for further evaluation. Erprobungskommando 162 fighters, which had been passed on to JV 44, an elite jet unit under Adolf Galland a few weeks earlier, were all destroyed by their crews to keep them from falling into Allied hands.
