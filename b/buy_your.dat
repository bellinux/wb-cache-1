2500|$|Connolly {{revisited}} this tenement in Drumchapel during filming for the South Bank Show in 1992. [...] "It eventually {{started to}} pall. This dreadful atmosphere came about the place. It's like Siberia. And once you're out here, there's no {{getting out of}} it. You have to <b>buy</b> <b>your</b> way out, {{or some kind of}} talent has to take you out, or {{you have to be very}} bright and move away to university." [...] Also at fourteen, Connolly started to become interested in music— mainly Jerry Lee Lewis and Chuck Berry.

2500|$|Roger Ebert {{said the}} film [...] "works and it {{delivers}} just {{about what you}} expect when you <b>buy</b> <b>your</b> ticket" [...] but felt that it [...] "lacks the mordant humor of the Romero version" [...] and the [...] "plot flatlines compared to the 1979 version, which was trickier, wittier and smarter." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety described it as an unnecessary remake that will appeal mostly to young adult audiences who {{have not seen the}} original film. [...] Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that the film [...] "has no patience for such subtleties" [...] as Romero's thematic concerns or suspense-building. [...] Elvis Mitchell of The New York Times wrote, [...] "Mr. Snyder's blood feast is strictly by the numbers: this second-rater could be the world's most expensive Troma film." [...] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times wrote, [...] "Good zombie fun, the remake of George A. Romero's [...] "Dawn of the Dead" [...] is the best proof in ages that cannibalizing old material sometimes works fiendishly well." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, [...] "Instead, the new [...] "Dawn of the Dead" [...] satirizes itself and satirizes its genre, and, on its own unambitious terms, the movie succeeds. It's silly, witty and good-natured, not scary so much as icky, and not horrifying or horrible but consistently amusing." [...] Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertainment Weekly rated it [...] "A" [...] and wrote, [...] "Commercial director Zack Snyder, making a killer feature debut, trades homemade cheesiness for knowing style, revels in the sophistication of modern special effects, and stomps off with the best remake – er, ”re-envisioning” – of a horror classic in memory." [...] Scott Tobias of The A.V. Club wrote that the remake streamlines the original film [...] "by discarding everything special about it in favor of pure visceral effect".|$|E
