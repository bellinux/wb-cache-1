5|$|Early {{sources on}} Richard Neville {{fall into two}} categories. The first are the {{sympathetic}} chronicles of the early Yorkist years, or works based on these, such as the Mirror for Magistrates (1559). The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick's fall, such as the Historie of the arrivall of Edward IV, and take a more negative view of the earl. The Mirror portrayed Warwick as a great man: beloved by the people, and betrayed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> he helped raise to the throne. The other perspective {{can be found in}} Shakespeare's Henry VI trilogy: a man driven by pride and egotism, who created and deposed kings at will.|$|E

As his legal bills added up, Barnette decided to lease the Fairbanks Daily News to a group of local businessmen. On June 15, 1908, Barnette ended the lease agreement by selling the newspaper to J.

Corson's campaign manager promptly was named the editor of the Daily News, and the paper switched to actively supporting Corson's candidacy.|$|E
