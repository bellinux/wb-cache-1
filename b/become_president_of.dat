5|$|Both Robert Bingham and Percy Haly died in 1937; with J. C. W. Beckham aging—he {{would die}} in 1940—Chandler moved {{to fill the}} {{leadership}} void in the faction. He soon came {{to believe he was}} destined to <b>become</b> <b>President</b> <b>of</b> the United States. In mid-1937, he began advocating for Marvel Mills Logan, Kentucky's junior senator, to be appointed to the Supreme Court, creating a Senate vacancy to which Chandler, as governor, could appoint himself. The death of Justice George Sutherland in January 1938 gave President Franklin D. Roosevelt the opportunity to accommodate Chandler's wishes, but Roosevelt preferred younger justices—Logan was 63—and Kentucky's senior Senator, Alben Barkley, recommended Solicitor General Stanley Forman Reed for the appointment. Roosevelt heeded Barkley's advice and appointed Reed instead of Logan.|$|E
5|$|Fantasia 2000, {{a sequel}} to the 1940 film {{that had been a}} pet-project of Roy E. Disney's since 1990, was {{released}} on January 1, 2000. Produced in pieces when artists were available between productions, Fantasia 2000 was the first animated feature produced for and released in IMAX format. A standard theatrical release followed in June, but the film's $90 million worldwide box office total against its $90 million production cost resulted in it losing $100 million for the studio. Peter Schneider left his post as president of Walt Disney Feature Animation in 1999 to <b>become</b> <b>president</b> <b>of</b> The Walt Disney Studios under Joe Roth. Thomas Schumacher, who had been Schneider's vice president of animation for several years, became the new president of Walt Disney Feature Animation. By this time, competition from other studios had driven animators' incomes to all-time highs, making traditionally animated features even more costly to produce. Schumacher was tasked with cutting costs, and massive layoffs began to cut salaries and bring the studio's staff– which peaked at 2,200 people in 1999– down to approximately 1,200 employees.|$|E
