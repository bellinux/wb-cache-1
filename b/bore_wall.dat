An intercooler and an updated intake manifold were added, the latter having a much larger throttle body and improved fuel rail. The result {{was an increase in}} output to 110ps (roughly 108bhp) from 74ps, and a much broader range of torque. Other changes included a reduction of engine capacity from 988 cc to 930 cc; this strengthened the engine by increasing the <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> thicknesses by 1 mm, and allowed cars using it to enter competition classes not otherwise possible due to rules on forced induction.|$|E
5000|$|Plasma {{transferred}} wire arc (PTWA) {{is another}} form of wire arc spray which deposits a coating on the internal surface of a cylinder, or on the external surface of a part of any geometry. It is predominantly known for its use in coating the cylinder bores of an engine, enabling the use of Aluminum engine blocks {{without the need for}} heavy cast iron sleeves. A single conductive wire is used as [...] "feedstock" [...] for the system. A supersonic plasma jet melts the wire, atomizes it and propels it onto the substrate. The plasma jet is formed by a transferred arc between a non-consumable cathode and the type of a wire. After atomization, forced air transports the stream of molten droplets onto the <b>bore</b> <b>wall.</b> The particles flatten when they impinge {{on the surface of the}} substrate, due to the high kinetic energy. The particles rapidly solidify upon contact. The stacked particles make up a high wear resistant coating. The PTWA thermal spray process utilizes a single wire as the feedstock material. All conductive wires up to and including 0.0625" [...] (1.6mm) can be used as feedstock material, including [...] "cored" [...] wires. PTWA can be used to apply a coating to the wear surface of engine or transmission components to replace a bushing or bearing. For example, using PTWA to coat the bearing surface of a connecting rod offers a number of benefits including reductions in weight, cost, friction potential, and stress in the connecting rod.|$|E

Friction and wear testing results demonstrated that Ni-WC coatings had much better tribological performance than gray cast iron under different lubricating conditions. These Ni-WC composite coatings exhibited excellent mechanical properties and tribological properties due to the strengthening effect of the WC phase...|$|R
50|$|The {{tight fit}} of the {{electronics}} required fairly close internal tolerances and the transparent cylinder needed to fit within an external armour cylinder with closer tolerances. The latter was necessary to avoid gaps between the sediment face to be imaged and the imaging plane. Gaps allow sediments to fall or smear and degrade the scientific value of the sediment profile. Stainless steel automobile exhaust tubing swaged by a hydraulic ram using a custom turned stainless steel (316) cone was ultimately used. Portals were cut into the centre section to allow imaging of a 210 x 150 mm area divided among four windows. In order to inject water into sediments so as to displace some but not disturb others a penetrating head was cast and plumbed. A number of penetrating head geometries were explored using a series of ¼ scale models attached to a penetrometer and forced into sandy sediments under water. A sharply angled plane with an offset conic section removed {{was chosen as the}} most efficient. With this configuration, the head first separated (by force) the sediments to be displaced while supporting the sediments of the <b>bore</b> <b>wall.</b> A vortex of water was created by angled water jets in the conic space. This design massively disturbed sediments in one ‘exhaust’ sector of the SPI image, but minimised disturbance in the remainder. The penetrator head was made by first carving 1.5 kg of butter into the desired shape, then casting a negative in plaster-of-Paris, water jets (copper tubing) were mounted within the mold, the assembly was dried in an oven at 70 °C for three days, and then positively cast using about 7 kg of molten lead. The final penetrator head is shown in Figure 10. Prior to deployment the device required a tether providing electrical and mechanical connections to the surface vessel and a frame to ensure that it entered the seabed perpendicularly.|$|E

Methods: In order {{to evaluate the}} sound pressure level (SPL) of the eddy current induced warm <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> vibration, a Finite Element (FE) model was created to simulate the noises from both the warm <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> vibration and the gradient coil assembly. For the SPL reduction of the warm <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> vibration, we first improved the active shielding of the gradient coil, thus reducing the eddy current on the warm <b>bore</b> <b>wall.</b> A damping treatment was then applied to the warm <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> to control the acoustic radiation. Results: Initial simulations show that the SPL of the warm <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> is {{higher than that of}} the gradient assembly with typical design shielding ratios at many frequencies.

30|$|One of the {{challenges}} to the {{ground source heat pump}} market is the cost burden of implementing the ground heat exchange. For the case of closed-loop vertical borehole designs, the thermal barrier presented by a loop can be significant. The high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe loop contacts the <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> via a thermal grout. For example, a 7 – 8  °C temperature difference between the water circulating in the loop and the <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> reduces the heat pump operating performance. In general, the loop legs are not constrained within the bore cross section, and during installation, the legs can twist and contact one another over {{a substantial portion of the}} bore length, thereby degrading performance. Typically, the loop is sealed to the <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> with a bentonite grout mixture, of which the hydraulic and thermal properties are very important to insure optimal performance of the installation. The use of a thermally enhanced grout, while advantageous to heat transfer between the loop and the <b>bore</b> <b>wall,</b> presents its own challenges. For example, the addition of sand to enhance conduction also increases thermal shunting between the legs of the loop and presents challenges in uniform mixing and deployment through a tremie pipe.|$|E

50|$|The {{change in}} voltage through the well bore {{is caused by}} a buildup of charge on the well <b>bore</b> <b>walls.</b> Clays and shales (which are {{composed}} predominantly of clays) will generate one charge and permeable formations such as sandstone will generate an opposite one. Spontaneous potentials occur when two aqueous solutions with different ionic concentrations are placed in contact through a porous, semi-permeable membrane. In nature, ions tend to migrate from high to low ionic concentrations. In the case of SP logging, the two aqueous solutions are the well bore fluid (drilling mud) and the formation water (connate water). The potential opposite shales is called the baseline, and typically shifts only slowly over the depth of the borehole.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present how {{statistical}} experimental design, {{time series analysis}} and non-linear dynamic models have been applied to gain a deeper insight into BTA-deep-hole drilling process. BTA-deep-hole drilling process is used to produce long holes of a length to diameter ratio larger than 5. This process normally produces holes of high quality with regard to straightness, smoothness of the <b>boring</b> <b>walls</b> and roundness. However, two dynamic disturbances, chatter and spiralling, are sometimes observed in the process. While chatter mainly results in increased wear of the cutting edges of the tool but may also damage <b>boring</b> <b>walls,</b> spilling damages the workpiece severely. In our study we applied experimental design to gain insight into the connection between process parameters and quality measures like roughness and roundness, {{while at the same}} time creating a database for dynamic modelling of the processes. This turned out ot be a very helpful approach because we observed all kinds of dynamic disturbances. In this paper we will focus on chatter which turned out to be dominated by a few (eigen-) frequencies. Two models were proposed to describe the variation of the amplitudes of these frequencies, on the one hand a stochastic differential equation and on the other hand a descriptive model based on piecewise periodogramms. In the latter model the knowledge of the underlying experimental design was used to distinguish between the effects of the assembly of the machine, like damping by the starting bush on the tool, and effects of the dynamics and stochastic influences. Because this model is completely data-driven it can be used as a starting point for the development of a suitable dynamic model of a process. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The electrogun metal vapor plasma {{discharge}} {{is a new}} high-power pulsed device for producing vapors of different metals.

The bore plasma ows under local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions and is weakly nonideal. Two electrogun shots involving different cathode materials (aluminum and titanium) are sim-ulated.

40|$|For cast-in-place piling for railway structures, {{usually the}} Boring Hole (BH) method with normal {{circulation}} boring or TBH method with reverse circulation boring is applied.

The first approach reduces capital cost of the loop field but retains the same annual savings, while the second does nothing to lower capital cost but rather improves annual utility savings. For example, the building owner might be more interested in lowering the loop field installation cost by 20 % and accepting less annual operating savings. Another strategic advantage might derive from less land utilization and associated mess.|$|E

Previous studies employed finite element numerical techniques (Sharqawy 2009; Sagia 2012; Liao 2012). While these are rigorous, they have also proven to be cumbersome to construct. Others have proposed analytical solutions (Hellström 1991; Gu 1998; Philippe 2010) that are readily applied but are restricted to a limited number of pipe geometries. While these studies support the understanding that increasing the grout thermal conductivity and locating the pipe legs proximal to the <b>bore</b> <b>wall</b> enhances borehole performance, it was left to Redmund (1999) and Beier (2012) to actually demonstrate this fact in field tests. A finite element model for the case of two loops in a borehole was published (Diersch 2010), following the work of Al-Koury et al. (2005). Finally, a recent comparative study of helical pipe and triple U-tube loop designs in foundation pile (Zarrella et al. 2013) is included here, as pertinent to this study.|$|E
40|$|Wellbore {{instability}} {{problems have}} been encountered in many gas and oil fields. Fractures and a high differential stress (i. e., a large difference between the principal effective stresses in the horizontal plane) {{are considered to be}} major causes of wellbore instabilities, including hole enlargement and high volume caving. This paper describes the results of a series of numerical analyses carried out using UDEC (Universal Distinct Element Code) to obtain a better understanding of wellbore instability. The effects of two different fracture patterns (randomly polygonal fractures and aligned fracture sets) and three different far-field stress conditions have been investigated for various wellbore pressures, corresponding to different mud densities during drilling. It is known that the differential stress has an important influence on wellbore instability. A comparison of the numerical results with the analytical solution for homogeneous elastic behaviour has been carried out. The numerical analysis shows that the effect of a high differential stress is exacerbated by the presence of adversely connected fractures near the <b>bore</b> <b>wall.</b> The drilling mud density significantly affects the deformation of and the mud loss from a wellbore during drilling.
