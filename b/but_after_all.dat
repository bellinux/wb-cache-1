5|$|Finally, {{the delegates}} {{turned to the}} vice presidency. Edmund Pettus, {{representing}} Alabama, moved the nomination of William Hayden English, a banker and former representative from Indiana. English, {{a member of the}} Indiana delegation, was fairly unknown to most delegates. He had been a Bayard enthusiast and was known as a successful businessman and hard money supporter; more crucially, he hailed from an important swing state. While Hendricks was a better-known representative of Indiana, Easterners in the party preferred English, who they saw as sounder on the money question. Several states seconded the nomination. John P. Irish of Iowa nominated former governor Richard M. Bishop of Ohio <b>but,</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> the other states expressed support for English, the Ohio delegation requested that Bishop's name be withdrawn and English's nomination made unanimous; the motion carried.|$|E

For example, the Novosibirsk theatre was initially designed in pure constructivistic style. It was an ambitious project of exiled architects. In the mid-1930s with introduction of new classicism, it was significantly redesigned.|$|E

25|$|The {{action of}} the story {{involves}} the hero fighting with a giant who is fifty feet tall, a ferocious boar and a dragon. His son is carried off as a baby by a griffin. The mother of his son, like Emaré and Geoffrey Chaucer's heroine Constance, is carried in an open boat to a distant land. There are scenes of non-recognition between the principal characters and a threat of incest; <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> these vicissitudes, father, son and mother are reunited at the end.|$|E
25|$|Lead {{singer and}} guitarist Mikey Heppner had formed the punk rock group the Dropouts {{in the early}} 2000s merely {{as a way of}} having fun {{performing}} at shows, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> his bandmates left for New York City to perform as the successful rock band the Stills full-time, he had an epiphany that he could take his own music more seriously, achieve that kind of success, and still have as much fun as he hoped. This, coupled with his first exposure to Tricky Woo (which he enjoyed for their resemblance to Black Sabbath and Deep Purple), led him to re-establish the Dropouts with a different musical style - hard rock - and a more earnest pursuit of success.|$|E
25|$|It {{ought to}} be remembered, as a comment on the {{unfavourable}} description by Jean de La Bruyère, that La Fontaine was a special friend and ally of Benserade, La Bruyere's chief literary enemy. <b>But</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> deductions much will remain, especially when it is remembered {{that one of the}} chief authorities for these anecdotes is Louis Racine, a man who possessed intelligence and moral worth, and who received them from his father, La Fontaine's attached friend for more than thirty years. Perhaps the best worth recording of all these stories is one of the Vieux Colombier quartet, which tells how Molière, while Racine and Boileau were exercising their wits upon le bonhomme or le bon (by both which titles La Fontaine was familiarly known), remarked to a bystander, Nos beaux esprits ont beau faire, ils n'effaceront pas le bonhomme. They have not.|$|E

25|$|By mid-1944 the Kittyhawk-equipped No. 78 Wing {{was heavily}} engaged in {{supporting}} the American advance along the north coast of New Guinea and another Kittyhawk wing, No. 81, {{was in the process}} of preparing to deploy to this area. To reinforce these two wings, RAAF headquarters decided to disband Nos. 84 and 86 Squadrons. No. 84 Squadron was directed to move to Aitkenvale Aerodrome near Townsville, and its advance and main parties left Horn Island on 17 May and arrived at Aitkenvale four days later. On 12 June, before the squadron was fully disbanded <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> its aircraft had been transferred, the unit was advised that it was to remain active as a cadre with approximately 30 airmen. Two days later it was decided to re-raise No. 84 Squadron as an active unit. It moved to Macrossan Airfield, which was also near Townsville, on 22 June and began to receive new Kittyhawks on 25 August. On 17 November, No. 84 Squadron moved to Ross River, also in the Townsville area, and received more personal and aircraft from No. 86 Squadron, the recently disbanded No. 3 Repair and Servicing Unit and First Tactical Air Force depots.|$|E
25|$|In 1912 {{during the}} First Balkan War, Kochan was acceded to Bulgaria {{and shortly after}} its {{population}} was forced to convert from Islam to Christianity. But soon Bulgaria was drawn into the Second Balkan War and the local inhabitants formed guerrilla corps together with {{the inhabitants of the}} villages of Vaklinovo, Lyubcha, Valkosel and Dospat. Detachments of 30, 50 and 60 insurgents were formed to counter the Bulgarian haidouks and eventually the Bulgarian military. On the eve of 27 September 1913 they attacked a Bulgarian frontier post adjacent to the village of Chavdar. Finally the appointed priest in the village was expelled and Islam restored. Due to the fear of revenge or second baptism in 1914 15 families emigrated to the village of , Balıkesir Province, Turkey. After the Treaty of Lausanne in 1923 all Muslims from Drama Prefecture were expelled from Greece. Some Pomaks found temporary shelter in Kochan where they prepared for emigration to Turkey. After two years, in 1925, they left dragging along some inhabitants of Kochan with them and settled in the villages of Edirne Province, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> some of the refugees remained in Kochan.|$|E
25|$|Families {{faced with}} asking prices of ten times {{or more of}} the initial value more often than not {{had no choice but to}} vacate their homes and farms, in the process losing {{everything}} they worked for; often it turned out to be a railroad employee who had purchased the property in question. A group of immigrant San Joaquin Valley farmers formed the Settlers' League in order to challenge the Southern Pacific's actions in court, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> of the lawsuits were decided in the favor of the railroads, one group decided to take matters into their own hands. What resulted was the infamous Battle at Mussel Slough, in which armed settlers clashed with railroad employees and law enforcement officers engaged in eviction proceedings. Six people were killed in the ensuing gunfight. The Southern Pacific would emerge from the tragedy as the prime target of journalists such as William Randolph Hearst, ambitious politicians, and crusade groups for decades to follow. Leland Stanford's term as Governor of California (while still serving on the SP's board of directors) enhanced the corporation's political clout, but simultaneously further increased its notoriety as well.|$|E

500|$|In 1789, the French {{revolution}} {{broke out}} {{and four years}} later war erupted between Britain and France. [...] Throughout the next tumultuous decade, trade with Europe became increasingly difficult. As Boydell's business relied heavily on foreign trade, especially French, his livelihood was threatened. When this market was cut off due to war in 1793, Boydell's business declined substantially. [...] He was forced to sell the Shakespeare Gallery, via a lottery, in order for his business to remain solvent. He died in December 1804 before the lottery was drawn, <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> of its 22,000 tickets had been sold.|$|E
500|$|The lyrical {{reference}} points in [...] are all quite interesting—if {{you consider the}} youth-obsessed reference collaborators {{of the first two}} singles and how uncomfortable it all feels. 'Superstar' offers a glimpse of something far more comfortable in its own skin. All the {{reference points}} will mean very little to your average 17-year-old. We suppose the idea is that they're icons whose imagery transcends generations blah blah blah <b>but</b> <b>after</b> <b>all</b> the aggressive positioning of the first two singles it's great to hear Madonna relaxing into this sort of song.

The project evolved when more environmental disasters struck—the Asian Earthquakes and Hurricane Katrina. But the big picture was climate change.

[...] Andrea Devaro of Long Island Press concluded, [...] "its simplicity beautifully portrays the complexity of emotions invoked in the song." [...] Leah Collins of Dose called Adele [...] "'60s bombshell glam" [...] {{and said that the}} video's [...] "simplicity is its strength." [...] She added: [...] "There's something about streetlamps, cafes and the River Seine that lend an air of melancholic elegance to what would otherwise be just another walk of shame by a girl with two-day-old hair. Not everyone gets to indulge in moments as tragic but beautiful as a weepy solitary walk through Paris landmarks. But then, we don't all have voices as tragic and beautiful as Adele's either."

However, Lulu had beaten The Redcaps to the British charts with her version of [...] "Shout". Their next single, in 1964, was a cover of Chuck Berry's [...] "Talking About You" [...] backed by [...] "Come on Girl". It has been rumoured that guitarist Jimmy Page, later of Led Zeppelin, played on [...] "Talking About You", in his early pre-Yardbirds London session days, but Walker has since said Page does not play on this track.
