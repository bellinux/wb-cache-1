5|$|At {{the time}} of the Arab Revolt and its aftermath, Aleppo's {{political}} elite was divided <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> embraced the Arab nationalist movement led by Faisal and those who sought political autonomy for Aleppo and its hinterland within the Ottoman state. A number of factors distinguished the attitudes of Aleppo's elite and populace from those of Damascus. For one, the economic well-being of Aleppo's inhabitants was dependent on open, commercial access to Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, which was predominantly populated by Turks; southwestern Anatolia was the principal market for Aleppo's goods and the principal supplier of its food and raw materials.|$|E
5|$|During the First Austrian Republic, pan-Germanists were {{represented}} by the Greater German People's Party and the agrarian Landbund. Although initially influential, these two groups soon lost most of their voters to the Christian Social Party and the Social Democratic Party. Both the Christian Socials and the Social Democrats accepted that unification between Austria and Germany was forbidden by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. A conflict would develop, however, <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> supported an Austrian national identity, such as the Christian Socials, and those rooted in German nationalism, such as the Social Democrats.|$|E

5|$|McKenzie {{was killed}} on 17 July 1889 by {{severance}} of the left carotid artery. Several minor bruises and cuts {{were found on the}} body, discovered in Castle Alley, Whitechapel. One of the examining pathologists, Thomas Bond, believed this to be a Ripper murder, though his colleague George Bagster Phillips, who had examined the bodies of three previous victims, disagreed.

5|$|Once in Buenos Aires, Castelli {{found himself}} in {{political}} isolation. The triumvirate and the newspaper La Gazeta blamed him for the defeat at Huaqui, and sought punishment as a deterrent.

Castelli suffered from tongue cancer during the long trial, which made it progressively more difficult for him to speak. He died on October 12, 1812, while the trial was still underway.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the U.S. Religious Census of 1906, all congregations {{associated}} with the Restoration Movement had been reported together by the Census Bureau. But as the movement developed, tensions grew <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> emphasized unity and those who emphasized restoration, highlighting differences in the groups' underlying approaches to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church. In contrast, the Christian Church may consider any practice not expressly forbidden.|$|E
5|$|Tamarod and Al Wefaq {{opposition}} society {{praised the}} protests {{and said they}} were successful. The government of Bahrain however said protests did not affect everyday life. The United States said it supported freedom of expression and assembly, and voiced its concern at the chances of violence. Analysts were divided <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> expected protests to be huge and those that did not see them having any chance. They were also divided about the reasons behind the absence of mass protests in Manama, some blaming it on the security forces, others on protest organizers.|$|E
5|$|A similar {{struggle}} {{began in}} India when the Government of India Act 1919 failed to satisfy demand for independence. Concerns over communist and foreign plots following the Ghadar Conspiracy ensured that war-time strictures were renewed by the Rowlatt Acts. This led to tension, {{particularly in the}} Punjab region, where repressive measures culminated in the Amritsar Massacre. In Britain public opinion was divided over the morality of the massacre, <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> saw it as having saved India from anarchy, and those who viewed it with revulsion. The subsequent Non-Co-Operation movement was called off in March 1922 following the Chauri Chaura incident, and discontent continued to simmer for the next 25 years.|$|E

5|$|The Marshall Court (18011835) had {{repeatedly}} {{taken up the}} issue of aboriginal title in the United States. However, with the exception of Cherokee Nation v. Georgia (1831), which was dismissed for lack of original jurisdiction, all the disputes had been between non-Indianstypically <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> derived their title from the government and those who derived their title from private purchases from Indians. The uniform rule of these cases, enunciated most clearly in Johnson v. M'Intosh (1823), was that non-Indians could not acquire valid land title from such private purchases. However, the purchase at issue in Fellows, the Treaty of Buffalo Creek (1838), had been ratified by the federal government.|$|E
5|$|The {{dynamic of}} the {{conclave}} was divided between the French Angevin cardinals, mostly created by Pope Urban IV, who were amenable to an invasion of Italy by Charles of Anjou, and the non-French (mostly Italian) cardinals whose numbers were just sufficient to prevent a French pope from being elected. Clement IV's crowning of Charles of Anjou as King of Naples and Sicily, previously a papal fief, had cemented {{the influence of the}} French monarchy in the Italian peninsula and created an intense division within the College of Cardinals <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> opposed and supported French influence, and by extension, ultramontanism. Conradin, the last ruler of the House of Hohenstaufen, had been beheaded in Naples just a month before the death of Clement IV.|$|E

Pierlot supported retreating to London, but was keen to preserve the unity of his government, most of which supported remaining in France. Hoping to keep the Belgian Congo under Belgian sovereignty, Pierlot allowed the Minister of the Colonies, Albert de Vleeschauwer, to leave France while the government met to consider whether it should resign {{to make way for}} a new constitutional authority in occupied Brussels.|$|E

5|$|The {{sections}} of the International that recognised {{the leadership of the}} International Secretariat remained optimistic about the possibilities for increasing the International's political influence and extended the entrism into social democratic parties which was already underway in Britain, Austria and elsewhere. The 1954 congress emphasised entrism into communist parties and nationalist parties in the colonies, pressing for democratic reforms, ostensibly to encourage the left-wing they perceived to exist in the communist parties to join with them in a revolution. Tensions developed <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> subscribed to the mainstream views of Pablo and a minority that argued unsuccessfully against open work. A number of these delegates walked out of the World Congress, and would eventually leave the International, including the leader of the new British section, John Lawrence, George Clarke, Michele Mestre (a leader of the French section), and Murray Dowson (a leader of the Canadian group).|$|E
5|$|Abraham Lincoln's {{constitutional}} election {{reflected the}} nation’s sectional divide, though 82 {{percent of the}} electorate had split among the Unionists, Lincoln, Stephen A.

Breckinridge resolved to secede from the United States and form the Confederate States of America. The Virginia Assembly called a special convention {{for the sole purpose of}} considering secession from the United States. Virginia was deeply divided, returning a convention of delegates amounting to about one-third for secession and two thirds Unionist. But the Unionists would prove to be further divided <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> would be labelled Conditional Unionists who would favor Virginia in the Union only if Lincoln made no move at “coercion”, and those who would later be called Unconditional Unionists who would be unwavering in their loyalty to the constitutional government of the United States.|$|E
5|$|As modern {{communities}} continued {{growing in}} and around Miami, developers looked to southern Dade County for new projects. The undeveloped keys south of Key Biscayne were viewed as prime development territory. Beginning in the 1890s local interests promoted {{the construction of a}} causeway to the mainland. One proposal included building a highway linking the Biscayne Bay keys to the Overseas Highway at Key Largo and to the developed barrier islands to the north. At the same time, pressure built to accommodate industrial development in South Florida. This led to competing priorities <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> wished to develop for residential and leisure use and those in favor of industrial and infrastructure development. On December 6, 1960, 12 of the 18 area landowners who favored development voted to create the City of Islandia on Elliott Key. The town was incorporated to encourage Dade County to improve access to Elliott Key in particular, which landowners viewed as a potential rival to Miami Beach. The new city lobbied for causeway access and formed a negotiating bloc to attract potential developers.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of World War I (also known as the First World War or the Great War), Southern Rhodesia was {{administered}} by the British South Africa Company, which had controlled it and Northern Rhodesia since acquiring them through diplomacy and conquest during the 1890s. The white population in Southern Rhodesia stood at 23,606 in 1911 (a minority of 3%), while Northern Rhodesia had about 3,000 white settlers (less than half of 1%). With the Company's charter due to expire in late 1914, most Southern Rhodesian public attention was focused on this issue before the outbreak of war. The settlers were split <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> backed continued administration by the Chartered Company and those who advocated responsible government, which would make Southern Rhodesia a self-governing colony within the British Empire. Still others favoured the integration of Southern Rhodesia into the Union of South Africa, which had been formed in 1910.

5|$|Coming {{just after}} New Zealand {{abandoned}} their 1967 rugby tour over South Africa's refusal {{to accommodate a}} mixed team, the cancellation of the 1968–69 MCC series over D'Oliveira marked the second such incident in two years. According to Oborne, the affair forced upon South African cricket a realisation {{that it had to}} change. In 1969, the South African Cricket Board of Control (SACBOC) announced that future teams would be racially integrated and selected purely on merit; efforts duly began to allow all races to compete against each other and share facilities. This led to some disagreement among non-white sports organisations <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> supported these incremental changes and those who wanted immediate disbanding of the old system. D'Oliveira, a member of the first group, was partly drawn into this conflict. He also faced criticism from those in South Africa and England who believed that, to oppose apartheid, he should have declared himself unavailable to tour in the first place. With the tour to South Africa cancelled, the MCC hastily arranged for its team to play a Test series in Pakistan instead. D'Oliveira played and was very successful. He remained an England regular for four more years and played for Worcestershire until 1979.|$|E
5|$|In late July, the French {{escalated}} their {{push into}} Syria's major inland cities. On 23 July, French troops led by General Fernand Goubeau, {{commander of the}} Army of the Levant's Fourth Division, captured Aleppo without resistance. The lack of resistance was criticized by commander al-Sa'dun in his memoirs. In the aftermath of Aleppo's occupation, he organized 750 rebels to oust the French from the city, a plan that did not materialize. The consequent flight of Aleppo's Arab nationalist leaders to the countryside and the French forces' military superiority managed to stymie a potential revolt in the city. On 25 July, French forces captured Damascus a day after routing a small Arab Army contingent and armed volunteers led by Yusuf al-'Azma at the Battle of Maysalun. Following the loss of Aleppo and Damascus, Barakat arranged a meeting of Antiochian rebel leaders in al-Qusayr, in which the attendants were divided <b>between</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> advocated either of the following: continuing the revolt, surrendering to the French or approaching the Turks for support. After the meeting, Barakat chose to defect to the French. Afterward, al-Sa'dun and his fighters continued the revolt in Barakat's former area of operations.|$|E
