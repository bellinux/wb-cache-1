5|$|Gordon arrived off Port Napoleon on 17 September, {{hoping to}} find Rowley {{maintaining}} the blockade off the port in Boadicea. Rowley was however off Île <b>Bourbon,</b> sparring with Bouvet's frigates, and therefore Gordon only found Hamelin's squadron in the harbour.

This gave the French forces on the island a significant regional advantage, outnumbering the British frigate on the recently captured Île <b>Bourbon,</b> commanded by Commodore Josias Rowley, by six to one. British reinforcements were hastily despatched to the area but the French were blockading Île <b>Bourbon</b> in force and the arriving reinforcements were in constant danger of attack by more powerful French units. Africaine was the first ship to reinforce Rowley's squadron, but within three days of her arrival in the region was engaged by two French ships while attempting to drive them away from Saint Denis on Île <b>Bourbon.</b> Corbet was severely wounded in the opening exchanges and subsequently died. Although his crew fought hard, they were overwhelmed by the French frigates and forced to surrender, only for Rowley to arrive in HMS Boadicea and drive off the French warships, recapturing Africaine.|$|E
