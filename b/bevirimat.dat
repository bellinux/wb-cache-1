25|$|Like {{protease}} inhibitors, <b>bevirimat</b> {{and other}} maturation inhibitors interfere with protease processing of newly translated HIV polyprotein precursor, called gag. Gag {{is an essential}} structural protein of the HIV virus. Gag undergoes a chain of interactions both with itself and with other cellular and viral factors to accomplish the assembly of infectious virus particles. HIV assembly is a two-stage process involving an intermediate immature capsid that undergoes a structurally dramatic maturation to yield the infectious particle. This alteration is mediated by the viral protease, which cleaves the Gag polyprotein precursor, allowing the freed parts to reassemble to form {{the core of the}} mature virus particle. <b>Bevirimat</b> prevents this viral replication by specifically inhibiting cleavage of the capsid protein (CA) from the SP1 spacer protein. First, <b>bevirimat</b> enters a growing virus particle as it buds from an infected cell and binds to the Gag polypeptide at the CA/SP1 cleavage site. This prevents the protease enzyme from cleaving CA-SP1. As the capsid protein remains bound to SP1, the virus particle core is prevented from compressing into its normal mature shape, which is crucial for infectivity, resulting in the release of an immature, non-infectious particle.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Bevirimat,</b> the {{prototype}} Human Immunodeficiency Virus type 1 (HIV- 1) maturation inhibitor, is highly potent in cell culture and efficacious in HIV- 1 infected patients. In contrast to inhibitors that target the active {{site of the}} viral protease, <b>bevirimat</b> specifically inhibits a single cleavage event, the final processing step for the Gag precursor where p 25 (CA-SP 1) is cleaved to p 24 (CA) and SP 1. Results In this study, photoaffinity analogs of <b>bevirimat</b> and mass spectrometry were employed to map the binding site of <b>bevirimat</b> to Gag within immature virus-like particles. <b>Bevirimat</b> analogs were found to crosslink to sequences overlapping, or proximal to, the CA-SP 1 cleavage site, consistent with previous biochemical data {{on the effect of}} <b>bevirimat</b> on Gag processing and with genetic data from resistance mutations, in a region predicted by NMR and mutational studies to have α-helical character. Unexpectedly, a second region of interaction was found within the Major Homology Region (MHR). Extensive prior genetic evidence suggests that the MHR is critical for virus assembly. Conclusions This is the first demonstration of a direct interaction between the maturation inhibitor, <b>bevirimat,</b> and its target, Gag.

Advisor: Louis Mansky. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vi, 103 pages, appendices A-B. Human Immunodeficiency Virus type- 1 (HIV- 1) replication is introduced in Chapter 1 {{with an emphasis}} on the late phase of viral replication. Literature about the production of infectious HIV- 1 is reviewed in Chapter 1 while focusing on targets for suppressive HIV- 1 therapy. Chapter 2 describes the discovery of triterpene compounds derived from birch trees that inhibit HIV- 1 replication reformatted from Bioorganic and Medicinal Chemistry Letters. Chapter 3 investigates the anti-HIV- 1 mechanisms of the triterpenes described in Chapter 2. Virus release assays conclude that the triterpene compounds target and prevents cleavage of the HIV- 1 Gag product CA-SP 1. Virus release assays and transmission electron microscopy indicate that the triterpene compounds SY 33 and <b>Bevirimat</b> have a secondary mechanism of action by causing 55 kDa Gag to accumulate in cells.

40|$|Abstract Background Maturation inhibitors are an {{experimental}} class of antiretrovirals that inhibit Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) particle maturation, the structural rearrangement required to form infectious virus particles. This rearrangement is {{triggered by the}} ordered cleavage of the precursor Gag polyproteins into their functional counterparts by the viral enzyme protease. In contrast to protease inhibitors, maturation inhibitors impede particle maturation by targeting the substrate of protease (Gag) instead of the protease enzyme itself. Direct cross-resistance between protease and maturation inhibitors may seem unlikely, but the co-evolution of protease and its substrate, Gag, during protease inhibitor therapy, could potentially affect future maturation inhibitor therapy. Previous studies showed that there might also be an effect of protease inhibitor resistance mutations {{on the development of}} maturation inhibitor resistance, but the exact mechanism remains unclear. We used wild-type and protease inhibitor resistant viruses to determine the impact of protease inhibitor resistance mutations on the development of maturation inhibitor resistance. Results Our resistance selection studies demonstrated that the resistance profiles for the maturation inhibitor <b>bevirimat</b> are more diverse for viruses with a mutated protease compared to viruses with a wild-type protease. Viral replication {{did not appear to be}} a major factor during emergence of <b>bevirimat</b> resistance. In all in vitro selections, one of four mutations was selected: Gag V 362 I, A 364 V, S 368 N or V 370 A. The impact of these mutations on maturation inhibitor resistance and viral replication was analyzed in different protease backgrounds. The data suggest that the protease background affects development of HIV- 1 resistance to <b>bevirimat</b> and the replication profiles of bevirimat-selected HIV- 1. The protease-dependent <b>bevirimat</b> resistance and replication levels can be explained by differences in CA/p 2 cleavage processing by the different proteases. Conclusions These findings highlight the complicated interactions between the viral protease and its substrate. By providing a better understanding of these interactions, we aim to help guide the development of second generation maturation inhibitors. </p...|$|E

Results In this study, we demonstrate that varying levels of BVM resistance are associated with point mutations at these residues. BVM susceptibility was maintained by SP 1 -Q 6 A, -Q 6 H and -T 8 A mutations. However, an SP 1 -V 7 A mutation conferred high-level BVM resistance, and SP 1 -V 7 M and T 8 Δ mutations conferred intermediate levels of BVM resistance. Conclusions Future exploitation of the CA-SP 1 cleavage site as an antiretroviral drug target will need to overcome the baseline variability in the SP 1 region of Gag. </p...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To discuss new {{antiretroviral}} agents (ARVs) {{and alternative}} ARV treatment {{strategies that are}} currently being evaluated, and to {{provide an overview of}} the most recent advances in HIV vaccine development. RECENT FINDINGS: There is a continuous need for improvements in ARV therapy (ART) and several new ARVs are currently undergoing clinical investigation, including the non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor rilpivirine, the integrase inhibitor elvitegravir, the chemokine receptor 5 co-receptor antagonist vicriviroc and the maturation inhibitor <b>bevirimat.</b> Strategies to optimize ART, such as treatment interruption, induction-maintenance and class-sparing regimens, are also being evaluated and have had varying success to date. However, vaccination still remains the optimal solution, and one second-generation preventative HIV vaccine has produced encouraging results in a recent phase III trial. SUMMARY: Global prevention and treatment with ARVs that are effective, well tolerated and have high barriers to the development of HIV resistance are the main strategies to fight HIV/AIDS while we await the development of an effective vaccine...|$|E
40|$|Background: Maturation inhibitors are a {{new class}} of {{antiretroviral}} drugs. <b>Bevirimat</b> (BVM) was the first substance in this class of inhibitors entering clinical trials. While the inhibitory function of BVM is well established, the molecular mechanisms of action and resistance are not well understood. It is known that mutations in the regions CS p 24 /p 2 and p 2 can cause phenotypic resistance to BVM. We have investigated a set of p 24 /p 2 sequences of HIV- 1 of known phenotypic resistance to BVM to test whether BVM resistance can be predicted from sequence, and to identify possible molecular mechanisms of BVM resistance in HIV- 1. Results: We used artificial neural networks and random forests with different descriptors for the prediction of BVM resistance. Random forests with hydrophobicity as descriptor performed best and classified the sequences with an area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve of 0. 93 ± 0. 001. For the collected data we find tha...|$|E

40|$|Protease-mediated {{maturation}} of HIV- 1 {{virus particles}} {{is essential for}} virus infectivity. Maturation occurs concomitant with immature virus particle release and is mediated by the viral protease (PR), which sequentially cleaves the Gag and Gag-Pol polyproteins into mature protein domains. Maturation triggers a second assembly event that generates a condensed conical capsid core. The capsid core organizes the viral RNA genome and viral proteins to facilitate viral replication in {{the next round of}} infection. The fundamental role of proteolytic maturation in the generation of mature infectious particles has made it an attractive target for therapeutic intervention. Development of small molecules that target the PR active site has been highly successful and nine protease inhibitors (PIs) have been approved for clinical use. This paper provides an overview of their development and clinical use together with a discussion of problems associated with drug resistance. The second-half of the paper discusses a novel class of antiretroviral drug termed maturation inhibitors, which target cleavage sites in Gag not PR itself. The paper focuses on <b>bevirimat</b> (BVM) the first-in-class maturation inhibitor: its mechanism of action and the implications of naturally occurring polymorphisms that confer reduced susceptibility to BVM in phase II clinical trials...|$|E
40|$|AbstractDespite {{significant}} {{advances in}} antiretroviral therapy, increasing drug resistance and toxicities observed among {{many of the}} current approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drugs indicate a need for discovery and development of potent and safe antivirals with a novel mechanism of action. Maturation inhibitors (MIs) represent one such new class of HIV therapies. MIs inhibit a late step in the HIV- 1 Gag processing cascade, causing defective core condensation {{and the release of}} non-infectious virus particles from infected cells, thus blocking the spread of the infection to new cells. Clinical proof-of-concept for the MIs was established with betulinic acid derived <b>bevirimat,</b> the prototype HIV- 1 MI. Despite the discontinuation of its further clinical development in 2010 {{due to a lack of}} uniform patient response caused by naturally occurring drug resistance Gag polymorphisms, several second-generation MIs with improved activity against viruses exhibiting Gag polymorphism mediated resistance have been recently discovered and are under clinical evaluation in HIV/AID patients. In this review, current understanding of HIV- 1 MIs is described and recent progress made toward elucidating the mechanism of action, target identification and development of second-generation MIs is reviewed...|$|E
