In July 2008 General Motors confirmed that a non-turbocharged, 1.4 L 4-cylinder engine would be used as the range extender, and that the intention was to build it in Flint, Michigan. In April 2009, General Motors allowed journalists to test the Volt powertrain in the body of Chevrolet Cruze sedans used as test mules which lacked the range-extending generator at the GM Technical Center in Warren, Michigan.|$|E

5000|$|Mobility disabilities due to age-related {{musculoskeletal}} pain {{or increase}} in chronic conditions {{are easier to}} detect by performance measures.

5000|$|When {{production}} {{began in}} 1980, EVA intended to produce hundreds of EVcorts {{for sale to}} the general public, but {{the complexity of the}} electronics resulted in prohibitively high production costs. By 1992, with a sale price of $58,000, the EVcort was being marketed only as a <b>battery</b> <b>testing</b> platform, rather than a general-use vehicle. [...] Sales were therefore effectively limited to institutions such as electric utilities and government agencies. From 1988 through 1994, the United States Department of Energy sponsored many of these purchases as part of its Site Operator program to evaluate the performance of various electric vehicle designs in fleet use. In general, the EVcort performed well in these tests, receiving high marks for its reliability, but with some complaints of inadequate acceleration. [...] Because of liability issues, it was Soleq's policy that the cars should be scrapped upon completion of testing. Nevertheless, some were eventually sold to hobbyists and as of 2011 a few remain in use, although most of the original Soleq controllers have failed and been replaced with modern high-frequency MOSFET controllers.|$|E

40|$|Summary Literatures on battery {{technologies}} and diagnosis of its parameters were studied. The innovative battery technologies from basic knowledge to world standard testing procedures were analysed and {{discussed in the}} report. The established <b>battery</b> <b>test</b> station and flowchart was followed during the <b>battery</b> <b>test</b> preparation and testing. In order to understand and verify the battery performance, the well established test procedures developed by USABC (United States Advanced Battery Consortium) and FreedomCAR were reviewed. Based on the standard <b>battery</b> <b>test</b> flow diagram, <b>battery</b> <b>test</b> procedures are mainly categorised as below; 1. 	Test plan and pre-test readiness review 2. 	Core performance test charging, discharging, power, capacity and other special tests 3. 	Life cycle/ageing test accelerated ageing, calendar life, abuse and safety Commercial battery testers were used to carryout the core performance test but electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was employed for life cycle test and also to investigate the state of health (SOH) and state of charge (SOC) of the <b>battery.</b> The standard <b>test</b> bench as shown below {{was used for the}} experiment under the scope of this thesis. Figure 1 : Standard <b>battery</b> <b>test</b> station Study on impedance based modelling of battery and laboratory experiment to measure the impedance was carried out. Electrochemical impedance was measured by applying an AC potential to an electrochemical cell and measuring the current through the cell using the shunt in series where battery voltage was measured directly from the terminals as shown in figure 1. Commercially available battery sensors were used to measure the current, voltage and temperatures. Impedance was calculated internally and observed on computer through the <b>battery</b> <b>test</b> program and also observed on Nyquest plot where real part is plotted on the X-axis and imaginary part on Y-axis at one frequency. A typical impedance spectrum of a Li-ion <b>battery</b> <b>tested</b> in the laboratory at 250 C is presented below. This figure shows the measured impedance for different state of charge (SOC) without dc excitation current. Figure 2 : Impedance Spectra of a Li-ion battery At real impedance Re(Z)  42 m, the real axis intersection of the impedance spectra was observed in the figure 2. For lower frequencies, all spectra show two semicircles. The first semicircle is comparably small and slightly depressed, whereas the second one is larger, nearly non-depressed and grows remarkably with decreasing state of charge. Finally, at the low-frequency end of the depicted spectra, the diffusion impedance becomes visible. At high states of charge, the diffusion impedance shows a 45 °-slope, which is typical of Warburg impedance (state of diffusion at certain frequency) ...|$|R

5000|$|Ars Technica {{was more}} critical; while complimenting its design for looking more premium than the {{previous}} Moto X, {{as well as the}} improved quality of the Z Force's [...] "ShatterShield" [...] display, it was argued that the removal of the headphone jack made the device feel less capable, and further considered its absence from the thicker Moto Z Force to be illogical. The mod system was considered to be superior in implementation to the G5 due to their ease of use and integration with the device and its software. However, the accessories themselves were criticized for being hampered by their form factor, and having standalone alternatives of a higher quality at more competitive pricing. The standard Moto Z scored poorly on <b>battery</b> <b>testing,</b> while the larger-capacity Moto Z Force performed better on the tests. Although Motorola's continuing practice of lightly enhancing the base Android experience was praised, the company was criticized for having stated that it would not release Android's monthly security patches, indicating a dwindling commitment by Motorola to servicing their devices than under Google ownership. In conclusion, it was argued that despite its competitive hardware, there was [...] "little reason" [...] to buy a Moto Z due to [...] "the lackluster Moto Mods, poor software update policy, a high price, and the omission of a headphone jack".|$|E

40|$|<b>Battery</b> <b>testing</b> {{procedures}} {{are important for}} understanding battery performance, including degradation {{over the life of}} the battery. Standards are important to provide clear rules and uniformity to an industry. The work described in this report addresses the need for standard <b>battery</b> <b>testing</b> procedures that reflect real-world applications of energy storage systems to provide regulation services to grid operators. This work was motivated by the need to develop Vehicle-to-Grid (V 2 G) testing procedures, or V 2 G drive cycles. Likewise, the stationary energy storage community is equally interested in standardized testing protocols that reflect real-world grid applications for providing regulation services. As the first of several steps toward standardizing <b>battery</b> <b>testing</b> cycles, this work focused on a statistical analysis of frequency regulation signals from the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland Interconnect with the goal to identify patterns in the regulation signal that would be representative of the entire signal as a typical regulation data set. Results from an extensive time-series analysis are discussed, and the results are explained from both the statistical and the battery-testing perspectives. The results then are interpreted in the context of defining a small set of V 2 G drive cycles for standardization, offering some recommendations for the next steps toward standardizing testing protocols. i...|$|E
