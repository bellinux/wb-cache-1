Canadian Online Explorer writer Bob Kapur rated the entire event a 9 out of 10, which was higher than the 2006 edition with a 7 out of 10 from Chris Sokol. <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory's ranking was higher than Unbreakable's rating, which received an 8 out of 10 by Corey David Lacroix. <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory also ranked higher than TNA's next event, Genesis, which also received an 8 out of 10 from Lacroix. Compared to rival World Wrestling Entertainment's (WWE) No Mercy and Taboo Tuesday PPV events, <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory out-performed both. No Mercy was given a 5 out of 10 while Taboo Tuesday received a 7 out of 10. <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory was also rated higher than WWE's WrestleMania 21, which took place on April3, 2005. While <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory received a 9 out of 10, WrestleMania was only given a 5 out of 10 by Dale Plummer and Nick Tylwalk.|$|E

5|$|Chris and Bryan Sokol of the Canadian Online Explorer {{reviewed}} and rated {{the show on}} a scale out of 10, giving it a 7. This was the same rating given to the 2009 edition by Nick Tylwalk, but lower than the 7.5 out of 10 given to the 2007 edition by Chris Sokol. Compared to TNA's previous PPV event No Surrender, <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory was received better as No Surrender was given a 3 out of 10 by Jason Clevett. Meanwhile, Chris and Bryan Sokol gave TNA's next PPV event Turning Point a 7 out of 10. Rival World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) produced two PPV events in October that competed against <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory IV.

5|$|<b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory is {{considered}} by TNA to be their equivalent to the National Football League's Super Bowl or rival World Wrestling Entertainment's WrestleMania event. As such, TNA used an extensive marketing campaign that involved several wrestlers dressing up as gangsters from the 1920s and 1930s era of Chicago to promote the show {{since it is the}} biggest event the company holds annually. Samoa Joe and The Latin American Xchange (Hernandez and Homicide) participated in some of these promotional video shoots. This was the first <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory event to use roman numerals in the title. TNA created a section on their company website to promote <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory IV. TNA released a poster to promote the show featuring Karen Angle, Joe, Booker T, Kurt Angle, Christian Cage, and Gail Kim. The official theme for the show was Tarantula by The Smashing Pumpkins. A contest was held to win upgraded ringside seats, free merchandise, and meet several TNA performers at <b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory IV by wearing a Halloween costume to the event, with a drawing being held {{prior to the start of}} the telecast.|$|E

5|$|<b>Bound</b> <b>for</b> Glory was {{received}} with mixed reviews. Canadian Online Explorer pro wrestling section writer Matt Bishop graded the event a 7 out of 10, {{the same as}} last year's event. He stated, “TNA's biggest show of the year, <b>Bound</b> <b>For</b> Glory, was a mix of good and bad. The show's biggest matches delivered on a show that featured a weak undercard”. He also gave the main event 8 out of 10, and the Lethal Lockdown match 7 out of 10. His lowest scores were for the Knockouts Title match that was given a 2 out of 10 and the Young-Jordan versus Neal-Moore match that was rated a dud.|$|E
