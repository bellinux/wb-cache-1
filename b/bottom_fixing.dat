In April 2011 the DeepCWind consortium visited MARIN to carry out model tests in the offshore wave basin with these three types of floating wind turbine platform. This paper reports a nu-merical study of a wind turbine supported by a semisubmersible floater.

40|$|Nowadays the {{offshore}} wind energy market is clearly oriented to be extended around the world. <b>Bottom</b> <b>fixed</b> solutions for supporting offshore wind turbines are useful in shallow waters which are available in a limited extent unless a continental shelf exists. Considering the Oil & Gas background knowledge, move from <b>bottom</b> <b>fixed</b> solutions to floating solutions is not a technical challenge, {{but the cost of}} each structure in terms of industry profit is currently the main issue for its commercial implementation. That point has induced huge research efforts on the topic. Recently, a new concept consisting of a monolithic concrete SPAR platform was experimentally and numerically studied in the framework of the AFOSP KIC-InnoEnergy project (Alternative Floating Platform Designs for Offshore Wind Towers using Low Cost Materials). The studies comprised a set of hydrodynamic tests performed in the CIEM wave flume facility at UPC, with a 1 : 100 scaled model assuming Froude similitude. The whole test campaign includes free decay tests, RAO’s determination, regular and irregular waves with and without wind mean force. For the determination of the platform RAO’s, a set of 21 regular waves trains with periods ranging from 0. 8 s up to 4. 8 s were applied. The 6 DOF motions of the platform were measured with an infrared stereoscopic vision system. In this paper, a summary of pitch and heave RAO’s tests will be presented with the main objective to calibrate and validate the accuracy of the Morison-based numerical model for floating wind turbine platforms developed at the Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya. Because the wave flume spatial constraints, both Airy and Stokes wave theories are necessary to reproduce the correct wave kinematics. The numerical model includes both theories and a comparison between them has been done, checking the validity range of each one. The simulations revealed a reasonable good agreement with the experimental results, as well with the computed RAO’s in commercial software. Peer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|The loading {{method in}} single fibre {{pull-out}} experiments would influence the stress distributions in the constituents which, in turn, determine the fibre debond and frictional pull-out stresses. The difference in these stresses for three loading conditions (i. e. the <b>fixed</b> matrix <b>bottom,</b> <b>fixed</b> fibre and matrix bottom and the restrained matrix top conditions) {{has been identified}} in a newly-developed analytical model {{that is based on}} a fracture mechanics approach. It is shown that the restrained matrix top condition induces a lower initial debond, maximum debond and frictional pull-out stresses compared with the <b>fixed</b> <b>bottom</b> conditions. This is explained by the observation that the potential energy release rate calculated for a given external stress with respect to incremental debond crack propagation is always higher, thereby allowing easy debonding, for the restrained top loading condition. After complete debonding, the interfacial frictional shear stress is significantly lower for the restrained top condition, requiring a low external stress to overcome the interfacial friction for fibre pull-out. The difference in the debond and pull-out stresses increases with increasing embedded fibre length and decreases with increasing ratio of matrix to fibre radii (or fibre volume fraction). A systematic way of evaluating the difference in theoretical predictions against experiments is also presented...|$|R

Thus, when the top plate is actuated, it moves towards the bottom plate and fills the void present within the bottom plate without touching it akin to how puzzle pieces are assembled. Further, a reasonable horizontal separation is maintained between both the plates to avoid shorting. The electrostatic forces come from the capacitance formed between the top plate and bottom plate, and from the capacitance formed between the top plate and the doped substrate.

The wakes of a classical <b>bottom</b> <b>fixed</b> turbine and a streamwise oscillating turbine are compared. Results indicate that platform pitch creates an upward shift in all components of the flow and their fluctuations. The vertical flow created by the pitch motion as well as the reduced entrainment of kinetic energy from undisturbed flows above the turbine result in potentially higher loads and less available kinetic energy for a downwind turbine. Experimental results are compared with four wake models. The wake models employed are consistent with experimental results in describing the shapes and magnitudes of the streamwise velocity component of the wake for a fixed turbine. Inconsistencies between the model predictions and experimental results arise in the floating case particularly regarding the vertical displacement of the velocity components of the flow. Furthermore, it is found that the additional degrees of freedom of a floating wind turbine add to the complexity of the wake aerodynamics and improved wake models are needed, considering vertical flows and displacements due to pitch motion...|$|R

40|$|Department of Urban and Environmental Engineering(Urban Infrastructure Engineering) Offshore {{structures}} are generally subjected to harsh environment with strong tidal current and wind loading, which demands robust and reliable Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) {{to avoid any}} catastrophic failure. The growing size, complexity, and harsh environment of offshore structures lead to difficulties in sensor deployment and maintenance. Response at critical locations in complex offshore rigs are inaccessible during sensor deployment. Moreover, their operational environment demands frequent sensor maintenance for uninterrupted monitoring. Virtual sensing addresses these issues by estimating unmeasured responses {{with the help of}} measured responses. This dissertation delineates a virtual sensing method based on Kalman state estimator to combine multi-sensor data under non-stationary random excitation. The estimation algorithm effectively uses the FE model of a structure to predict and fuse different type of structural response (acceleration, strain, and angular displacement). This study investigates various combinations of sensor fusion to improve the estimation accuracy. In addition, an erroneous model is purposefully used to support the robustness and practicality of estimator.
