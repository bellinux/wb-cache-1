50|$|In 1907, Walter A. Sheaffer {{patented}} the Lever filler, using a {{hinged lever}} {{set into the}} pen barrel which pressed down onto a bar which in turn compressed the rubber sac inside, creating a vacuum to force ink into the pen. Introduced in 1912, this innovation was rapidly imitated by the other major pen makers. Parker introduced the button filler, which had a button hidden beneath a <b>blind</b> <b>cap</b> {{on the end of}} the barrel; when pressed, it acted on a pressure bar inside to depress the ink sac.|$|E
50|$|The {{church of}} St John the Baptist was built around 1360. The tower has three stages with {{diagonal}} buttresses, moulded string courses, north-east polygonal higher corner stair turret with <b>blind</b> panelled embattled <b>cap</b> and pierced quatrefoil lozenge parapet with corner pinnacles and gargoyles.|$|R

It is dated to c. 1360 by Poyntz Wright and after 1420 by Harvey.|$|R
50|$|Another {{variety of}} gashapon is bottle cap figures. These small figures are mounted atop a plastic bottle cap, {{as might be}} found on a twenty-ounce soda bottle. They are sold both in machine {{capsules}} and <b>blind</b> boxes. The <b>caps</b> are not fully functional as {{they do not have}} screw threads to secure them to the mouth of the bottle.|$|R
50|$|The {{acorn nut}} {{is a type}} of {{fastener}} which gets its name from its shape. Acorn nut is its common name and it is also called a crown hex nut, <b>blind</b> nut, <b>cap</b> nut or domed cap nut. It is a nut that has a domed top to cover the threads. This is to prevent contact with the external thread to protect the threads or protect other things the threads would rub against. In addition the dome gives a more finished appearance. It is usually made of brass, steel, stainless steel (low carbon content) or nylon. It can also be chrome plated and given a mirror finish.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blind</b> gained 42 <b>caps</b> for the Netherlands over {{a ten-year}} period, scoring once against Greece in a UEFA Euro 1992 qualifier. He made his debut in 1986 against Scotland {{but was not}} capped at all in 1987 or 1988, an absence which meant he missed {{being a part of}} the triumphant UEFA Euro 1988 side. He did, however, appear at the 1990 and 1994 World Cups and the 1992 and 1996 European Championships, {{retiring}} after the latter.|$|R
2500|$|Blind bidding: Virtually all games {{include a}} variant that may happen during bidding; {{one or more}} players, having not yet looked at their cards, may choose to bid {{on the number of}} tricks they will take. When bidding [...] "blind", the player's bid, if made exactly by that player, is rewarded with bonus points, while failing to make the bid results in the bonus being {{subtracted}} from the player's or team's score. <b>Blind</b> bidding is <b>capped</b> at a bid of seven. Thus, bidding a blind 8 or higher is contrary to standard game play, and is not allowed. Quite commonly, blind bids are allowed only if the bidding team is at least 100 points behind, and in many cases, whether a minimum point spread is required, these risky bids are typically made by a team with a large deficit as a last-ditch effort; blind bids made in this situation are typically called [...] "trailing blind bids".|$|R
