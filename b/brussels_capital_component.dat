40|$|The <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> Region {{is one of}} {{the three}} Regions in federal Belgium and {{represents}} a highly developed urban area with a concentration of residential, administrative, commercial, educational and industrial functions. The Government of the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> Region is actively implementing policies to improve traffic, mobility and air quality in its area. To this effect, the use of electric and hybrid vehicles is being envisaged and a number of electric vehicles has been actually deployed. The widespread introduction of electrically powered vehicles will arise the need for suitable infrastructures to be developed. In the framework of this paper, the mutual impact of electric vehicles and their infrastructure will be assessed. A number of infrastructure solutions which have been developed in some cities are to be assessed, and the choice of technology which is most suitable for <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> Region identified.

40|$|The article {{examines}} transfers between regions via {{the central government}} budget, referring essentially to the regional household accounts published by the National Accounts Institute. It examines only the aspects concerning allocation between the regions of that part of government revenue and expenditure {{for which there is}} no direct counter-consideration. The Flemish Region is currently a net contributor to transfers between regions via the central government budget, whereas the Walloon Region is a net recipient. The <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> Region also makes a net contribution, though only a small one. These transfers between regions are due largely to variations in the contributions of each region to government revenues. In the case of households, the contribution of the Flemish Region exceeds that of the other two regions; for businesses, it is the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> Region that makes the largest contribution. In addition, these transfers originate from the regional allocation of social benefits. Thus, unemployment benefits entail transfers from the Flemish Region to the Walloon Region and the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> Region. In contrast, transfers between the regions via pensions currently favour the Flemish Region. In regard to health care expenditure, there are hardly any transfers between the regions at present. Projections also show the importance of both the expected demographic trends and labour market developments for the future pattern of transfers between regions. The influence of demographic trends is most favourable for the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> Region and least favourable for the Flemish Region. This is likely to increase the net contribution from the former while the latter’s net contribution will decline, even if the current labour market divergences largely persist in the future. In contrast, in the event of full convergence of employment levels, the inter-regional transfers paid by the Flemish Region would actually disappear altogether, and the <b>Brussels</b> <b>Capital</b> Region would become the sole net contributor, though in that case the inter-regional transfers received by the Walloon Region would decline sharply. Finally, international comparison shows that transfers between regions are relatively small in Belgium, compared to what is seen in other EU Member States. regions, transfers, solidarity mechanisms...|$|R
