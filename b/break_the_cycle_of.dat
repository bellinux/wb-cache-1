Harrison adds that the song specifically espouses the message that [...] "we are not these bodies, we are in these material bodies in the physical world." [...] His friend Ravi Shankar once observed that Harrison exhibited tyagi, a trait meaning non-attachment or renunciation, a point to which Shankar added: [...] "He had everything – all the wealth, the fame, whatever he wanted. But he was not attached to it... because he was searching for something much higher, much deeper. It does seem like he already had some Indian background in him [...]" [...] Harrison later said of life in the material world, referring to the need to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> rebirth associated with reincarnation: [...] "The whole point to being here, really, is to figure a way to get out." ...|$|E

[...] On Zhakul, Amon's role in the Ulan prophecy is further elaborated on, and it is here that he is first referred to as the [...] "fallen one."

500|$|The Kikuuiki album {{sessions}} {{were influenced by}} the commercial success of [...] "Aruku Around", where the band considered what sorts of songs they wanted to make, {{and what sort of}} music they should present to their new audience for the audience to understand what songs Sakanaction create other than [...] "Aruku Around"-style ones. The band did not want to make an album full of songs identical to [...] "Aruku Around", and instead wanted to express to their listeners the breadth of musical inspirations that they could mix together. Yamaguchi felt {{that it was important to}} not release a second similar song immediately after [...] "Aruku Around", as he saw that music consumers in the 2010s were acting as critics on their own Mixi or Twitter accounts. For these people, he believed it was important to exhibit different aspects of the band. He felt this was important for growing Sakanaction as a band, to <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> a musical act becoming popular, then continuing to release the same style of music that made them popular until people grew tired of them. Even before the single's success, the band planned to feature songs on the album that would go against listeners expectations of what Sakanaction was as a band. On the other hand, the band attempted to keep a commercial sound, the same goal of Shin-shiro, or else they felt that their efforts would have been wasted. This led the band trying to create pop art music, blending art with commercialism.|$|E

2500|$|Also, {{during his}} time in South Africa, in his essay, Hind Swaraj, (1909), Gandhi {{formulated}} his vision of Swaraj, or [...] "self-rule" [...] for India based on three vital ingredients: solidarity between Indians of different faiths, {{but most of all}} between Hindus and Muslims; the removal of untouchability from Indian society; and the exercise of swadeshi – the boycott of manufactured foreign goods and the revival of Indian cottage industry. The first two, he felt, were essential for India to be an egalitarian and tolerant society, one befitting the principles of Truth and Ahimsa, while the last, by making Indians more self-reliant, would <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>cycle</b> <b>of</b> dependence that was not only perpetrating the direction and tenor of the British rule in India, but also the British commitment to it. At least until 1920, the British presence itself, was not a stumbling block in Gandhi's conception of swaraj; rather, it was the inability of Indians to create a modern society.|$|E
