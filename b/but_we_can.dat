25|$|Research {{has shown}} that people {{were less likely to}} use formulaic {{language}} in general topics and domains they were more well-versed in, because they were more adept at selecting the appropriate terms.

25|$|Scholars have {{attempted}} to localize individual poems by studying the geography, flora, and fauna to which they refer. This approach usually does not yield firm results.

Similarly, the apocalyptic descriptions of Völuspá have been taken as evidence that the poet who composed it had seen a volcanic eruption in Iceland - but this is hardly certain.|$|E

25|$|On Blanshard's view, the Absolute is {{thus not}} merely {{consistent}} (i.e., noncontradictory) but positively coherent, {{shot through with}} relations of necessity and indeed operating purely deterministically. (Blanshard held the law of causality, properly understood, to be a logical law and believed that effects logically determine their causes as well as vice versa.) Strictly speaking, he admitted, we cannot prove {{that there are no}} atomic facts, bare conjunctions, or sheer surds in nature, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take it as our working hypothesis that relations of necessity are always to be found; until and unless this hypothesis meets with absolute defeat, we are justified in adopting it at least provisionally.|$|E
25|$|Zoroaster {{emphasized}} {{the freedom of}} the individual to choose right or wrong and individual responsibility for one's deeds. This personal choice to accept aša, or arta (the divine order), and shun druj (ignorance and chaos) is one's own decision and not a dictate of Ahura Mazda. For Zarathustra, by thinking good thoughts, saying good words, and doing good deeds (e.g. assisting the needy or doing good works) we increase this divine force aša or arta in the world and in ourselves, celebrate the divine order, and we come a step closer on the everlasting road to being one with the Creator. Thus, we are not the slaves or servants of Ahura Mazda, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> make a personal choice to be his co-workers, thereby refreshing the world and ourselves.|$|E

In case of troops withdrawal and acknowledgement of independence of Chechen Republic of Ichkeria, we are obliged not to make any political, military, or economic treaties with anyone against Russia, not to accommodate foreign military bases on our territory even temporarily, not to support and not to finance groups or organizations carrying out a military struggle against RF, {{to be present in}} the united ruble zone, to enter CIS. Besides, we can sign a treaty even though a neutral state status is more acceptable to us. We can also guarantee a renunciation of armed struggle against RF by all Muslims of Russia for at least 10 to 15 years under condition of freedom of faith.

25|$|John Stuart Mill, the English thinker and politician, began a {{formative}} year visiting France {{at the age}} of 14 with {{a two-week}} stay at Pompignan in June 1820. In long letters to his father (who financed the educational trip), the precocious Mill details his extensive reading in the library of the chateau, including almost one work per day by Voltaire, Lefranc's main enemy, without once referring to the marquis' own works. Even by then something of a connoisseur of gardens, he walked in what he called the 'pleasure grounds' of the chateau almost every day, and sometimes to the plateau above (whose views he was to recall later, in other works), without ever giving any detail on the park itself. Mills was in Pompignan as a guest of Samuel Bentham, who was renting a property in the grounds, giving weight to the belief that the marquis (the second) was impecunious at that point. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> take it that the garden must have been in good order during Mill's visit, or he would have remarked on it.|$|E

500|$|Coffin's first {{jobs were}} to design small flower gardens {{such as the}} {{suburban}} garden she designed for Edward Sprague in 1906 in Flushing, Queens. Noted for its original design, it was situated on a modest lot measuring 150 feet by 300 feet (45 m by 91 m), typical of the new suburban developments being built on Long Island at the time. A few years later, she wrote about the Sprague garden in Country Life in America and Elsa Rehmann also discussed it in her 1918 book The Small Place: Its Landscape Architecture. Coffin argued that a [...] "moderately well-to-do" [...] homeowner could create and maintain a substantial and elaborate garden for a modest expenditure, {{comparable to that of}} a mid-range car. She promoted the idea that even the most featureless lot could be beautified through good design: [...] "We certainly cannot create a magnificent view, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> plan and plant beautiful screens and backgrounds that will be interesting at all seasons of the year. We may not easily be able to construct a picturesque diversity at ground level, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> plant so as to have much height and variety in our flower and shrub groups." ...|$|E

500|$|Philip Womack in The Daily Telegraph commented, [...] "This is monumental cinema, {{awash with}} {{gorgeous}} tones, and carrying an ultimate message that will resonate with every viewer, young or old: there is darkness {{in all of}} us, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> overcome it." [...] He further expressed that David Yates [...] "transmutes [...] into a genuinely terrifying spectacle." [...] Another review was released {{on the same day}} from Evening Standard, who rated the film 4 out of 5 and stated [...] "Millions of children, parents, and those who should know better won't need reminding what a Horcrux is– and director David Yates does not let them down. In fact, in some ways, he helps make up for the shortcomings of the final book." [...] The Daily Express remarked that the film showcases [...] "a terrifying showdown that easily equals Lord of the Rings or Star Wars in terms of a dramatic and memorable battle between good and evil." ...|$|E
500|$|However, in {{the face}} of the loss of his daughter, Mac learns, in Briley's words, that [...] "his life as a Christian is no more {{sheltered}} from this world's tragedies than it was before." [...] Before finding redemption, Sledge questions why God has allowed his life to take the path it has and, in particular, why his daughter was killed instead of him. Commentators have described this as a prime example of theodicy, the question of why evil exists that is commonly faced by Christians. Scholar Richard Leonard writes, [...] "For all believers, the meaning of suffering is the universal question.... No answer is completely satisfying, least of all the idea that God sends bad events to teach us something." [...] Following the death of his daughter, Mac moves forward with uncertainty as the film ends. Jewett writes of this conclusion, [...] "The message of this film is that we have no final assurances, any more than Abraham did. <b>But</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> respond in faith to the tender mercies we have received." ...|$|E

500|$|Rock 'n' Roll Circus {{received}} mixed to favorable {{reviews from}} most music critics. [...] A staff reviewer from CD Journal praised the album's rock influences, and commended the album's production. Greg from Selective Hearing was positive towards the album. He commented, [...] "This {{was an excellent}} album and I couldn’t think of a single thing that could be wrong. It proves that Ayu is still {{at the top of}} her game." [...] However, he felt that [...] "Last Links", [...] "Lady Dynamite", [...] "Sexy Little Things", [...] "The Meaning Of Love", and [...] "Red Line -for TA-" [...] were the album's, [...] "standard cookie cutter fillers". Asian Junkie editor Random J reviewed the album on his personal blog, and awarded it seven stars. He stated, [...] "Rock 'n Roll Circus feels more accessible and easier to connect with than the likes of Guilty." [...] He later commented, [...] "I think this is one of the few albums where Ayumi Hamasaki sounds comfortable and locked into its sound... The album title is a tad misleading, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> forgive Ayumi Hamasaki for it, given that given the music is good." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, supervising {{animator}} on {{the film}} Scott Clark, spoke about the challenges of animating car characters, saying: [...] "Getting {{a full range of}} performance and emotion from these characters and making them still seem like cars was a tough assignment, but that's what animation does best. You use your imagination, and you make the movements and gestures fit with the design. Our car characters may not have arms and legs, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> lean the tires in or out to suggest hands opening up or closing in. We can use steering to point a certain direction. We also designed a special eyelid and an eyebrow for the windshield that lets us communicate an expressiveness that cars don't have." [...] Doug Sweetland, who also served as supervising animator, also spoke about the challenges, saying: [...] "It took a different kind of animator to really be able to interpret the Cars models, than it did to interpret something like The Incredibles models. With The Incredibles, the animator could get reference for the characters by shooting himself and watching the footage. But with Cars, it departs completely from any reference. Yes they're cars, but no car can do what our characters do. It's pure fantasy. It took a lot of trial and error to get them to look right." ...|$|E
500|$|After leaving Bradford, McCall {{spent some}} time {{out of the game}} before being {{recruited}} to work as a scout for Norwich City by Rangers former chief scout Ewan Chester. At the end of 2010, he was among a number of men interviewed for the managerial vacancy at Scottish Premier League club Motherwell to succeed Craig Brown, before being given the job on a two-and-a-half-year contract. His first game in charge was a 0–0 draw away to Hamilton Academical on New Year's Day 2011, with McCall stating: [...] "It was a fair result. You take positives, a clean sheet, <b>but</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be better and we will be better." [...] He followed it up with a 4–0 victory in the Scottish Cup against Dundee before his maiden league victory – and the club's first since November – against Hibernian by the end of January. McCall was partly selected as new manager because of his knowledge of the lower leagues of English football; he was active in the transfer market in his early days, bringing in Steve Jones – a player he had at Bradford – and Mike Grella from Leeds United, although the latter move was cancelled because of a FIFA ruling limiting the number of clubs a player can sign for in one season. Having operated without an assistant for his first few weeks in charge, McCall chose former Airdrie United manager Kenny Black as his number two. McCall led Motherwell to the semi-finals of both Scottish Cup competitions – they were defeated 2–1 by his former side Rangers in the League Cup but reached the final of the Scottish Cup by defeating St Johnstone 3–0.|$|E
