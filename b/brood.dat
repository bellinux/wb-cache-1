5|$|<b>Brood</b> parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's <b>brood,</b> is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own <b>brood.</b> <b>Brood</b> parasites may be either obligate <b>brood</b> parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate <b>brood</b> parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase their reproductive output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some <b>brood</b> parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E

40|$|In {{polygynous}} {{species with}} biparental care, {{the amount of}} paternal support often varies considerably. In the pied flycatcher (Ficedula hypoleuca), females mated with monogamous males receive more male assistance during the nestling phase than females mated with bigynous males, as the latter have to share their mates with another female. Bigynous males, however, give more support to their primary <b>broods</b> than to their secondary <b>broods.</b> Using a long-term dataset (31 years), the present study revealed that direct reproductive success, i. e. number of fledglings, was lower in females that mated with bigynous males, especially in secondary <b>broods</b> without male assistance, than in females that mated with monogamous males. Secondary <b>broods</b> with male assistance were more affected than primary <b>broods.</b> Female survival was independent of mating status. In primary <b>broods,</b> a delayed compensation for inferior direct reproductive success was found {{in terms of the}} number of grandoffspring, a phenomenon that did not occur in secondary <b>broods.</b> Delayed compensation in primary <b>broods</b> refers to indirect effects, i. e. good genes. According to the sexy son hypothesis, genetically superior (i. e. sexy) males may have sons with a higher number of <b>broods</b> belonging to a polygynous breeding status than do sons from <b>broods</b> with a monogamous father. This was indeed the case for sons descending from primary <b>broods,</b> but not for sons descending from secondary <b>broods...</b>|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Four limited-area <b>brooding</b> {{systems were}} {{compared}} to full-house <b>brooding</b> to deter-mine the effect on growth rate, feed conversion, and mortality.

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{modified}} (cooler) thermal <b>brooder</b> environment and dietary nutrient densities on growth rate, feed intake, feed efficiency and livability of juvenile male turkeys (Nicholas) brooked to 8 weeks of age were investigated. The economic implications of a modified (cooler) <b>brooder</b> environment as a supplemental energy conserving practice was also evaluated;Juvenile turkeys <b>brooded</b> {{in an environment that}} was 5. 6 (DEGREES) C cooler than normally recommended grew at slower rates, consumed less feed and had the same feed efficiency as poults <b>brooded</b> in the recommended <b>brooder</b> temperatures. Livability of healthy poults was not affected by the modified (cooler) thermal environment. However, the cooler thermal environment increased death losses of poults infected with pathogenic bacteria (Salmonella sp.), particularly {{during the first week of}} brooding;Feeding juvenile turkeys diets 8 % higher in metabolizable energy and 5 % higher in crude protein increased growth rate and improved feed efficiency as compared with feeding lower nutrient density diets, irrespective of thermal environment. No extra feed cost was associated with the cool temperature <b>brooding</b> as compared with normal temperature <b>brooding</b> to 8 weeks of age, irrespective of dietary nutrient density;Modifying traditionally recommended <b>brooder</b> temperatures for juvenile turkeys reduced electrical energy used for supplemental heat during <b>brooding</b> to 8 weeks of age. Electrical energy cost was reduced 5. 8 cents per poult by modifying the recommended <b>brooder</b> temperatures;The combination of lower feed cost and lower supplemental energy cost per poult associated with cool temperature <b>brooding</b> resulted in considerable monetary savings. These implications together with the combined results of growth rate, feed consumption, feed efficiency and livability indicated that juvenile turkeys were successfully <b>brooded</b> in a modified (cooler) thermal environment as compared with poults <b>brooded</b> normally...|$|R

5|$|American goldfinches are {{occasionally}} {{victims of}} <b>brood</b> parasites, particularly brown-headed cowbirds. One {{study found that}} 9% of nests had brown-headed cowbird eggs in them. American goldfinches make very poor hosts for <b>brood</b> parasites, with studies showing low hatching rates of brown-headed cowbird eggs and no fledging success. This is {{despite the fact that}} the American goldfinch has no known behavioral adaptations against <b>brood</b> parasites. It is thought that the inability of brown-headed cowbird chicks to survive is due to a failure to get enough nutrition; the seed-rich diet of American goldfinch chicks varies from the usual insect-rich diet of other hosts.|$|E
40|$|<b>Brooding</b> of nestlings in cooperatively {{breeding}} bird species may be disrupted by the attendance of helpers at the nest. We studied {{the factors that}} influence <b>brooding</b> in the cooperatively breeding honeyeater, the Bell Miner (Manorina melanophrys), and how nest attendants interacted with the bird <b>brooding</b> at the nest. Only the breeding female <b>brooded</b> nestlings, despite helpers assisting with many other aspects of the care of nestlings. The number of bouts of <b>brooding</b> by the female per hour was dependent upon the age and number of nestlings, ambient air temperature, and the number of Bell Miners visiting the nest. Behaviours performed by the female differed significantly between <b>brooding</b> and non-brooding visits. These findings are consistent with earlier studies of species with simpler biparental care. However, the complexity of meeting the nutritional and thermoregulatory requirements of nestlings in a cooperatively breeding species is demonstrated by changes in the behaviour of nest attendants when females were <b>brooding,</b> and by the different responses of females to different nest attendants. Nest attendants delayed visiting the nest when the female was <b>brooding.</b> However, if an attendant did visit the nest while the female was <b>brooding,</b> she was more likely to stop <b>brooding</b> and allow nestlings to be fed if the attendant was the breeding male, rather than a helper, irrespective {{of whether or not the}} attendants were close relatives of the nestlings...|$|R

50|$|<b>Brooding</b> duties {{are shared}} equally between {{the male and}} female golden-headed quetzal. The first 8-14 days after hatching, adults are present in the nest and <b>brooding</b> 60-90% of each day, after which <b>brooding</b> drops rapidly. There appears to be no clear pattern to when the female or male <b>broods,</b> however, it was {{observed}} that the male consistently <b>broods</b> for longer near the start of the <b>brooding</b> period, while the female <b>broods</b> more near the end of that period. It is also believed that it is exclusively the female quetzal that <b>broods</b> at night. Feeding duties are also shared equally between the sexes, with the non-brooding adult arriving with food before changing places with the <b>brooding</b> adult. When changing places, the adults seem to observe a ritual, with the incoming adult perching above the nest and emitting a whinnying call to signal the <b>brooding</b> adult to depart the nest. While <b>brooding,</b> the adults enter the nest to feed the nestling; when <b>brooding</b> ends, the adults initially continue to enter the nest but spend less time inside before leaving; at 8 days before fledging they simply lean in to feed the chick before departing; finally at 4-6 days before fledging the chick is able to perch on the lip of the nest and is fed from there before the adult departs. The food the adults bring to the nestling is usually insects, but also fruit. On the day of fledging the chick perches {{at the front of the}} nest and flies away, remaining near the nest for some time before leaving the area. Unlike other trogons, but like other quetzals, the golden-headed quetzal seems to maintain a clean nest by either removing or more often swallowing all droppings.|$|R
5|$|Some {{intraspecific}} <b>brood</b> parasitism occurs, and {{instances of}} unusually {{large numbers of}} eggs in a nest {{may be the result}} of females laying eggs in the nests of their neighbours. Such foreign eggs are sometimes recognised and ejected by females. The house sparrow is a victim of interspecific <b>brood</b> parasites, but only rarely, since it usually uses nests in holes too small for parasites to enter, and it feeds its young foods unsuitable for young parasites. In turn, the house sparrow has once been recorded as a <b>brood</b> parasite of the American cliff swallow.|$|E

5|$|Eusociality {{involves}} cooperative <b>brood</b> care (including <b>brood</b> care of offspring {{from other}} individuals), overlapping generations within {{a colony of}} adults, and a division of labour into reproductive and non-reproductive groups.
