5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally towards them. Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong <b>because</b> <b>our</b> behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E

25|$|Some of his assertions seem {{paradoxical}} {{and difficult}} to understand at first glance, {{not only because they}} are taken out of context, but above all <b>because</b> <b>our</b> habits of thought make us reduce everything to its visible appearance in the world instead of trying to attain its invisible reality in life. It is this separation between visible appearance and invisible reality which allows the dissimulation of our real feelings and which grounds the possibility of sham and hypocrisy, which are forms of lies.|$|E
25|$|Whether or not qualia or {{consciousness}} {{can play}} any causal {{role in the}} physical world remains an open question, with epiphenomenalism acknowledging the existence of qualia while denying it any causal power. The position has been criticized by a number of philosophers, if only <b>because</b> <b>our</b> own consciousness seem to be causally active. In order to avoid epiphenomenalism, one who believes that qualia are nonphysical would need to embrace something like interactionist dualism; or perhaps emergentism, the claim that there are as yet unknown causal relations between the mental and physical. This in turn would imply that qualia can be detected by an external agency through their causal powers.|$|E

500|$|Glosserman and {{the rest}} of the {{production}} team met together to put together a focus for the film; they centered their efforts on answering the question: [...] "How does Wikipedia get at the truth?" [...] They also wanted to provide information for everyday individuals wanting to know about Wikipedia's background and functioning. Experts were sought out, including the author of The Age of American Unreason Susan Jacoby, to discuss Wikipedia's approach to scholars knowledgeable about specific subject matter. Glosserman commented in an interview with IndieWire, [...] "We tried to get people offering compelling arguments for either side of any particular topic <b>because</b> <b>our</b> intention was to be objective and to let the viewer make up his or her own mind." [...] The narrative structure of the film What the Bleep Do We Know!? served as an inspiration for Glosserman during the production process.

Guthrie told Frost [...] "e didn't {{want to have to}} assault, because it's a very difficult operation, there are big risks in it but we have done it [...] <b>because</b> <b>our</b> negotiations were getting nowhere.

500|$|Philosophers and non-philosophers {{differ in}} their intuitions about what {{consciousness}} is.

[...] Gilbert Ryle, for example, argued that traditional understanding of consciousness depends on a Cartesian dualist outlook that improperly distinguishes between mind and body, or between mind and world. He proposed that we speak not of minds, bodies, and the world, but of individuals, or persons, acting in the world. Thus, by speaking of [...] "consciousness" [...] we end up misleading ourselves by thinking that there is any sort of thing as consciousness separated from behavioral and linguistic understandings. [...] More generally, many philosophers and scientists have been unhappy about the difficulty of producing a definition that does not involve circularity or fuzziness.|$|E
