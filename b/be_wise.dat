5|$|While seated {{upon the}} bare rocks I have often {{observed}} these little animals watching me, apparently {{with as much}} curiosity as I watched them, turning their heads {{from side to side}} as if in an effort to <b>be</b> <b>wise.</b> If I kept quiet for a few minutes they would creep up to me and finally upon me; if I moved, they ran down the faces of the rocks, and turning, stuck their heads above the edges to watch me.|$|E
5|$|Carey has {{expressed}} her belief in God and her connection between music and spirituality, {{and felt the}} album was finally a way to portray her mysticism into music. After the success of Carey's previous effort, Music Box, there was speculation of a new project in the works; however {{it was not until}} October 1994, only one month before the album's release, that Billboard announced Carey would be releasing a holiday album for the Christmas season. Initially, critics were shocked; they did not know how Carey would fare as an entertainer, as she had previously only been viewed as a pop star. Nevertheless, Carey, unaffected by the speculation, continued working on, and promoting the album in high spirits, confident in her work. The idea proved to <b>be</b> <b>wise,</b> earning Carey recognition in various markets including Christian radio and contemporary R stations, as well as extended her fame in Japan, where the album experienced much of its success.|$|E
25|$|Junior proto-terrorists {{interested}} in starting their own revolutionary {{groups based on}} the Marighella's tactics would <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to steer clear: it didn't work {{in the early seventies}} and it's less likely to work now.|$|E

They gave better advice, so far as they and you {{understood}} the case. But I know something which you do not, as is usual with commanders,--and therefore I came down. In view of all that you know, it would have <b>been</b> <b>wisest</b> to have gone back, but in view of all that I know, it <b>is</b> <b>wisest</b> to come down." ...|$|R
25|$|His {{attitude}} from August 1914 was a noble one, too noble to <b>be</b> <b>wise.</b> He {{cared for}} the success of the British aims, especially insofar as they could be achieved by the Admiralty, and for nothing else. His passion for this aim was pure, self-devoted, and all-devouring. He failed to remember he was a politician.|$|E
25|$|When mass {{immunization}} {{programs are}} part of the health services in FID, it can <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to avoid extreme measures to keep insurgents from receiving immunization. Increasing overall population immunity benefits all in the country, especially if the insurgency ends. In disaster situations, it also can provide long-term benefits not to check identification as closely as might be done in other situations.|$|E
25|$|However, if {{the river}} floods beyond a safe limit for the canal, then the gates are closed (and an extra lock created) until the river drops again. Since {{this is a}} true lock it is {{possible}} for boats to leave the canal for the flooded river despite the difference in water levels (though this is not likely to <b>be</b> <b>wise)</b> or (more sensibly) to allow boats caught out on the flood to gain refuge in the canal.|$|E

60|$|The magi, as you know, <b>were</b> <b>wise</b> men--wonderfully wise men--who brought {{gifts to}} the Babe in the manger. They invented the art of giving Christmas presents. <b>Being</b> <b>wise,</b> their gifts <b>were</b> no doubt <b>wise</b> ones, {{possibly}} bearing the privilege of exchange in case of duplication. And here I have lamely related to you the uneventful chronicle of two foolish children in a flat who most unwisely sacrificed for each other the greatest treasures of their house. But in a last word to the wise of these days let it be said that of all who give gifts these two <b>were</b> the <b>wisest.</b> Of all who give and receive gifts, such as they <b>are</b> <b>wisest.</b> Everywhere they <b>are</b> <b>wisest.</b> They <b>are</b> the magi.|$|R

25|$|By the mid-1940s, Sim {{was cast}} in {{starring}} roles in films. His earliest successes as a leading man included the police detective in the thriller Green for Danger (1946); the headmaster of Nutbourne College, co-starring with Margaret Rutherford, in the farcical comedy The Happiest Days of Your Life (1950); and a writer of lurid crime fiction in the comedy Laughter in Paradise (1951). His other films included Waterloo Road (1944), London Belongs to Me (1948), Alfred Hitchcock's Stage Fright (1950), Scrooge (A Christmas Carol) (1951), Folly to <b>Be</b> <b>Wise</b> (1953) and An Inspector Calls (1954).|$|E
25|$|Yes then {{signed a}} deal with Frontiers Records and began {{recording}} in Los Angeles with Trevor Horn serving as producer. Much of the album material was extrapolated {{from a pair of}} songs written by Horn and Geoff Downes around the time that they had been Yes members during 1980 and the Drama album. During the recording sessions, the band thought it would <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to bring Downes back to replace Oliver Wakeman on keyboards, reasoning that he was closer to the material. Upon completion of recording in March 2011, and post-production a month later, the album was released worldwide that July. Fly from Here peaked at number 30 in the UK and 36 in the US.|$|E
25|$|Spencer's {{association}} with Social Darwinism might have its origin {{in a specific}} interpretation of his support for competition. Whereas in biology the competition of various organisms can result {{in the death of}} a species or organism, the kind of competition Spencer advocated is closer to the one used by economists, where competing individuals or firms improve the well being of the rest of society. Spencer viewed private charity positively, encouraging both voluntary association and informal care to aid those in need, rather than relying on government bureaucracy or force. He further recommended that private charitable efforts would <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to avoid encouraging the formation of new dependent families by those unable to support themselves without charity.|$|E

25|$|The German {{architect}} and city engineer Conrad Schick, a Jerusalem resident, later published a similar booklet, {{where he also}} detailed his own proposal for a railway, which called for a line through Ramallah and Beit Horon. A route {{along the lines of}} Schick's plan was for a long time considered the most viable, and French engineers conducted an extensive survey to that end in 1874–75. The concept of a railway to Jerusalem was also thought of by the American writer James T. Barclay; he envisioned a line from el-Arish, Askalon or Gaza. Another proposal was made by the engineer Humann, who surveyed the area suggested in 1864 that it would <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to create a railway to Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|Socrates {{also says}} that the accusations {{for which he is}} {{answering}} in court already had been spoken and published by the comic poet Aristophanes, and are therefore beyond the legal scope of a trial for corruption and impiety. Years earlier, in the play The Clouds (423 BC), Aristophanes lampooned Socrates as a charlatan, the paradigm philosopher of atheist and scientific sophistry — carefully arranged arguments constructed of ornate words and phrases — misrepresented as wisdom. In light of that definition, Socrates defensively argues that he cannot be mistaken for a Sophist philosopher because Sophists are wise men, are thought to <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> by the people of Athens, and, thus, are highly paid for their teaching; whereas he (Socrates) lives in ten-thousand-fold poverty, and knows nothing noble and good (23c).|$|E
25|$|Humayun {{decided it}} would <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> to {{withdraw}} still further. He and his army rode out through and across the Thar Desert, when the Hindu ruler Rao Maldeo Rathore allied with Sher Shah Suri against the Mughal Empire. In many accounts Humayun mentions {{how he and his}} pregnant wife had to trace their steps through the desert at the hottest time of year. Their rations were low, and they had little to eat; even drinking water was a major problem in the desert. When Hamida Bano's horse died, no one would lend the Queen (who was now eight months pregnant) a horse, so Humayun did so himself, resulting in him riding a camel for six kilometres (four miles), although Khaled Beg then offered him his mount. Humayun was later to describe this incident as the lowest point in his life.|$|E

25|$|On October 11, 1999, in Game 5 of the ALDS, Charles Nagy {{started for}} Cleveland and Bret Saberhagen started for Boston, both on {{only three days}} rest. Boston jumped out to a quick two-run lead {{in the top of}} the first inning, but Cleveland responded with three runs of their own in the bottom half of the innings. The hitting continued, {{knocking}} Saberhagen out of the game in the second inning having allowed five runs, and then Nagy out of the game after only finishing only three innings and allowing eight runs. Going into the fourth inning, manager Jimy Williams opted to replace Derek Lowe with the ailing Pedro Martínez, who had left Game 1 with a back injury. This decision would prove to <b>be</b> <b>wise,</b> as Martínez threw six hitless innings in relief to win and clinch the ALDS.|$|E
25|$|By 1943, the Philippine Government-in-exile {{was faced}} with a serious crisis. According to the 1935 Constitution, the {{official}} term of President Quezon was to expire on December 30, 1943 and Vice-President Sergio Osmeña would automatically succeed him in the Presidency. This eventuality was {{brought to the attention of}} President Quezon by Osmeña himself, who wrote the former to this effect. Aside from replying to this letter informing Vice-President Osmeña that it would not <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> and prudent to effect any such change under the circumstances, President Quezon issued a press release along the same line. Osmeña then requested the opinion of U.S. Attorney General Homer Cummings, who upheld Osmeña's view as more in keeping with the law. Quezon, however, remained adamant. He accordingly sought President Roosevelt's decision. The latter choose to remain aloof from the controversy, suggesting instead that the Philippine officials themselves solve the impasse.|$|E
25|$|Satisfactory {{as it may}} be to note {{his general}} {{acceptance}} for the time being of the proposed relations of France with Arabia, his reference to the future of those relations adumbrates a source of trouble which it will <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> not to ignore. I have {{on more than one occasion}} brought to the notice of His Majesty's Government the deep antipathy with which the Arabs regard the prospect of French Administration of any portion of Arab territory. In this lies considerable danger to our future relations with France, because difficult and even impossible though it may be to convince France of her mistake, if we do not endeavour to do so by warning her of the real state of Arab feeling, we may hereafter be accused of instigating or encouraging the opposition to the French, which the Arabs now threaten and will assuredly give.|$|E

He accordingly sought President Franklin D. Roosevelt's decision. The latter choose to remain aloof from the controversy, suggesting instead that the Philippine officials themselves solve the impasse. A cabinet meeting was then convened by President Quezon. Aside from Quezon and Osmeña, others present in this momentous meeting were Resident Commissioner Joaquin Elizalde, Brig. Gen. Carlos P. Romulo, and Cabinet Secretaries Andres Soriano and Jaime Hernandez. Following a spirited discussion, the Cabinet adopted Elizalde's opinion favoring the decision and announced his plan to retire in California.|$|E

[...] While Oppenheimer favored no demonstration {{of the power of the}} new weapon to Japanese leaders, Lawrence felt strongly that a demonstration would <b>be</b> <b>wise.</b> When a uranium bomb was used without warning in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima, Lawrence felt great pride in his accomplishment.|$|E

Music critic Robert Christgau was also unimpressed; speculating in the May 1968 issue of Esquire {{on the content of}} the Magical Mystery Tour film, which had yet to air in America, Christgau wrote: [...] "But if Paul McCartney's work on the film clip of 'Hello Goodbye' is any indication, we would <b>be</b> <b>wise</b> not to hope for too much." ...|$|E
