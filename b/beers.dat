5|$|Most <b>beers</b> are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned <b>beers</b> retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat <b>beers.</b> Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned <b>beers.</b>|$|E
5|$|The De <b>Beers</b> company, as the world's largest diamond mining company, holds a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} industry, and has done so since soon after its founding in 1888 by the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. De <b>Beers</b> is currently the world's largest operator of diamond production facilities (mines) and distribution channels for gem-quality diamonds. The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of De <b>Beers</b> and markets rough diamonds from De Beers-operated mines. De <b>Beers</b> and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40% of annual world diamond production. For most of the 20th century over 80% of the world's rough diamonds passed through De <b>Beers,</b> but by 2001–2009 the figure had decreased to around 45%, and by 2013 the company's market share had further decreased to around 38% in value terms and even less by volume. De <b>Beers</b> sold off {{the vast majority of}} its diamond stockpile in the late 1990s – early 2000s and the remainder largely represents working stock (diamonds that are being sorted before sale). This was well documented in the press but remains little known to the general public.|$|E

5|$|UNITA's {{ability to}} mine {{diamonds}} {{and sell them}} abroad provided funding for the war to continue even as the movement's support in the Western world and among the local populace withered away. De <b>Beers</b> and Endiama, a state-owned diamond-mining monopoly, signed a contract allowing De <b>Beers</b> to handle Angola's diamond exports in 1990. According to the United Nation's Fowler Report, Joe De Deker, a former stockholder in De <b>Beers,</b> worked {{with the government of}} Zaire to supply military equipment to UNITA from 1993 to 1997. De Deker's brother, Ronnie, allegedly flew from South Africa to Angola, directing weapons originating in Eastern Europe. In return, UNITA gave Ronnie bushels of diamonds worth $6million. De Deker sent the diamonds to De Beer's buying office in Antwerp, Belgium. De <b>Beers</b> openly acknowledges spending $500million on legal and illegal Angolan diamonds in 1992 alone. The United Nations estimates Angolans made between three and four billion dollars through the diamond trade between 1992 and 1998. The UN also estimates that out of that sum, UNITA made at least $3.72billion, or 93% of all diamond sales, despite international sanctions.|$|E
5|$|While {{a variety}} of <b>beers</b> are popular across Northern England, the region is {{especially}} associated with brown ales such as Newcastle Brown Ale, Double Maxim and Samuel Smith's Nut Brown Ale.

5|$|Wine and beer, {{especially}} of the home-made varieties, were central to socialising in Wales, {{as they were in}} England. This remained the case even when tea gained popularity in England, supplanting the home-made alcohol. Beer is now the national drink of Wales, although Welsh <b>beers</b> never gained the status of other British <b>beers,</b> such as stout or English ales. This was in part due to the breweries keeping promotion of their products to a minimum so as not to upset the temperance movement in Wales.|$|E

5|$|Beer {{ranges from}} less than 3% alcohol by volume (abv) to around 14% abv, though this {{strength}} can be increased to around 20% by re-pitching with champagne yeast, and to 55% abv by the freeze-distilling process. The alcohol content of beer varies by local practice or beer style. The pale lagers that most consumers are familiar with fall {{in the range of}} 4–6%, with a typical abv of 5%. The customary strength of British ales is quite low, with many session <b>beers</b> being around 4% abv.
