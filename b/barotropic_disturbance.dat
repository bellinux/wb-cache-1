40|$|ABSTRACT. Direct current {{measurements}} and {{studies of the}} temperature distri-bution in the Greenland Sea indicate that while the Polar Water of the East Green-land Current originates in the Arctic Ocean, the intermediate and deep water masses circulate cyclonically, There are systematic seasonal changes in the tem-perature and salinity of the Polar Water. These changes {{are associated with the}} annual cycle of freezing and melting of ice; they are conditioned by horizontal advection, vertical turbulent diffusion, and in winter by penetrative convection. During summer there is a pronounced baroclinic tendency which should be mani-fested by a decrease in current speed with depth. However, direct current measure-ments during winter show {{that there is no such}} variation. The most likely cause of this discrepancy is that the relative importance of the baroclinic contribution to the pressure gradient varies seasonally. Lateral water mass displacements of 70 km. or more within a few days have been observed at all depths within the East Green-land Current, suggesting a large-scale <b>barotropic</b> <b>disturbance</b> as a primary cause.

40|$|A Charney-Branscome based {{parameterization}} {{has been}} tested {{as a way of}} representing the eddy sensible heat transports missing in a zonally averaged dynamic model (ZADM) of the atmosphere. The ZADM used is a zonally averaged version of a general circulation model (GCM). The parameterized transports in the ZADM are gaged against the corresponding fluxes explicitly simulated in the GCM, using the same zonally averaged boundary conditions in both models. The Charney-Branscome approach neglects stationary eddies and transient <b>barotropic</b> <b>disturbances</b> and relies on a set of simplifying assumptions, including the linear appoximation, to describe growing transient baroclinic eddies. Nevertheless, fairly satisfactory results are obtained when the parameterization is performed interactively with the model. Compared with noninteractive tests, a very efficient restoring feedback effect between the modeled zonal-mean climate and the parameterized meridional eddy transport is identified...|$|R
40|$|Large-scale {{transport}} of volatiles and condensates on Mars, {{as well as}} atmospheric dust, is ultimately driven by the planet's global-scale atmospheric circulation. This circulation arises {{in part from the}} so-called mean meridional (Hadley) circulation that is associated with rising/poleward motion in low latitudes and sinking/equatorward motion in middle and high latitudes. Intimately connected to the mean circulation is an eddy-driven component due to large-scale wave activity in the planet's atmosphere. During winter this wave activity arises both from traveling weather systems (i. e., <b>barotropic</b> and baroclinic <b>disturbances)</b> and from 'forced' disturbances (e. g., the thermal tides and surface-forced planetary waves). Possible contributions to the effective (net) transport circulation from forced planetary waves are investigated...|$|R
40|$|The Arizona Monsoon Boundary {{is defined}} as the {{boundary}} separating two distinctly different air masses over Mexico, the southwestern United States, and the adjacent Pacific during the summer. The structure and dynamics of this boundary are examined by cross-sectional analysis using three different data sources: (1) a time-height cross section, constructed using radiosonde observations, at the time the boundary initially passed through Tucson in 1984; (2) a composite cross section through the boundary, constructed from the Fleet Numerical Oceanography Center analysis; and (3) a cross section through the boundary using high-resolution fields of temperature, moisture, and geopotential height obtained from the VISSR Atmospheric Sounder (VAS). All three cross sections showed similar structure. In some respects, the Arizona monsoon boundary resembles a mid-latitude front with a distinct and relatively sharp air mass change across the boundary, forced almost entirely by confluence. A direct ageostrophic circulation is produced by this forcing, giving weak ascent on the warm, moist side of the boundary. The gradients and flow associated with the composite boundary are weaker, by a factor of four, than those associated with strong mid-latitude fronts. However, the VAS cross section suggests that, at times, the strength of the boundary approaches that of middle-latitude fronts. The wind shear suggested by the composite boundary ought to be unstable to baroclinic or <b>barotropic</b> processes. <b>Disturbances</b> developing along the boundary have been observed. One example of such a disturbance is examined using GOES imagery, lightning strike data, cloud track winds, and VAS data. Satellite images show the disturbance resembling a mid-latitude occluded cyclone, with an apparent low pressure center over northern Baja California and front-like cloud features extending eastward and southward from the low. Lightning strike data show convective activity occurring along the front-like features. Wind data indicate the presence of a cyclonic circulation south of San Diego along the Baja California coast. Cross sections using VAS data suggest that barotropic and baroclinic energy sources are present and suggest the front-like nature of the cloud feature extending southward from the low pressure center. Additionally, a second disturbance that eventually interacted with the monsoon boundary is briefly examined using satellite imagery...|$|R
