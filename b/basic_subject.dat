500|$|The {{major themes}} of the novel revolve around the {{influence}} of Christianity, {{the importance of social}} hierarchies, and the inherent superiority of civilised Europeans over the South Sea islanders; Martine Dutheil, professor of English, considers the novel [...] "a key text mapping out colonial relations in the Victorian period". The <b>basic</b> <b>subject</b> of the novel is popular and widespread: [...] "castaway children assuming adult responsibilities without adult supervision", and The Coral Island is considered the classic example of such a book.|$|E
500|$|Following word of Benchley's resignation, {{freelance}} offers began piling up. He worked constantly while {{claiming he}} was intensely lazy. (According to legend, he submitted a magazine piece titled [...] "I Like to Loaf" [...] {{two weeks after}} deadline. His explanatory note: “I was loafing.”) He was offered $200 per <b>basic</b> <b>subject</b> article for The Home Sector, and a weekly freelance salary from New York World {{to write a book}} review column three times per week for the same salary he received at Vanity Fair. The column, titled [...] "Books and Other Things," [...] ran for one year and roved beyond literature to mundane topics such as Bricklaying in Modern Practice. Unfortunately for Benchley, however, his writing a syndicated column for David Lawrence drew the ire of his World bosses, and [...] "Books and Other Things" [...] was dropped.|$|E
500|$|Helen McCullough {{describes}} Murasaki's {{writing as}} of universal appeal and believes The Tale of Genji [...] "transcends both its genre and age. Its <b>basic</b> <b>subject</b> matter and setting—love at the Heian court—are {{those of the}} romance, and its cultural assumptions {{are those of the}} mid-Heian period, but Murasaki Shikibu's unique genius has made the work for many a powerful statement of human relationships, the impossibility of permanent happiness in love... and the vital importance, in a world of sorrows, of sensitivity to the feelings of others." [...] Prince Genji recognizes in each of his lovers the inner beauty of the woman and the fragility of life, which according to Keene, makes him heroic. The story was popular: Emperor Ichijō had it read to him, even though it was written in Japanese. By 1021 all the chapters were known to be complete and the work was sought after in the provinces where it was scarce.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>basic</b> <b>subject</b> of Wolfram's [...] "new kind of science" [...] is {{the study}} of simple {{abstract}} rules—essentially, elementary computer programs. In almost any class of a computational system, one very quickly finds instances of great complexity among its simplest cases (after a time series of multiple iterative loops, applying the same simple set of rules on itself, similar to a self-reinforcing cycle using a set of rules). This seems to be true regardless of the components of the system and the details of its setup. Systems explored in the book include, amongst others, cellular automata in one, two, and three dimensions; mobile automata; Turing machines in 1 and 2 dimensions; several varieties of substitution and network systems; primitive recursive functions; nested recursive functions; combinators; tag systems; register machines; reversal-addition. For a program to qualify as simple, there are several requirements: ...|$|E
