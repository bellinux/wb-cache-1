500|$|In December 2012, while Burton's casting {{was only}} rumored, Deanna Barnert of MSN's TV Buzz Blog wrote: [...] "Assuming Burton {{actually}} comes to The Young and the Restless, the <b>biggest</b> <b>question</b> on everyone's mind {{is whether the}} former mob hit man will show up as a good guy, play another a toughie with a heart or go pure villain." [...] Barnert also {{said it would be}} [...] "interesting" [...] to see whether [...] " [...] legion of fans from Port Charles will follow him to Genoa City." [...] Jill Farren Phelps developed a reputation and [...] "bad rap" [...] because she [...] "uses people" [...] according to Mark Pinter, an actor and friend of Phelps who had been hired by her to portray Marcus Wheeler on The Young and the Restless. Barnert noted that Burton is [...] "someone who has made his allegiance to Phelps clear" [...] which is why [...] "many fans" [...] had expected him to show up in Genoa City [...] "eventually". TV Guides Michael Logan had also weighed in on the rumors, calling Burton's [...] "willingness" [...] to work in Los Angeles after leaving General Hospital to live in Nashville a [...] "puzzler". Logan suggested that there could have been more to his decision to quit General Hospital. Stephen Nichols, who had portrayed Tucker McCall on The Young and the Restless for over three years, was fired that December. Logan said Phelps, who was [...] "under orders" [...] to trim the show's budget, may have fired Nichols in order to afford Burton in lieu of him.|$|E
2500|$|Reviews of The Colbert Report {{upon its}} 2005 premiere were positive, {{although}} critics were generally skeptical {{that the character}} could extend beyond one season without growing tiresome. While positively reviewing the program as a whole, Maureen Ryan of the Chicago Tribune echoed these sentiments: [...] "The <b>biggest</b> <b>question</b> hanging over The Colbert Report is whether the show’s sendup of the pomposity and fear-mongering of cable news blowhards will be as appealing in the long term." [...] Melanie McFarland of the Seattle Post-Intelligencer summarized the show's early reaction: [...] "Critics and bloggers either loved the premiere or declared themselves to be unmoved, but that's the standard reaction after any late-night program's debut. A truer measure will be seen in coming weeks, after the hype wears off and the ratings lose their exuberance." ...|$|E
