40|$|Relevance for {{occupational}} science Occupational science studies patterns of occupation; habits, routines, and lifestyle. There {{has never been}} a theoretical model or measure of occupational patterns for scientists to use as a baseline for research. This presentation describes a theoretical model and measure of <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> useful for future research in occupational science. If <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> is a valid and unique construct, worthy of study, with potential implications for individuals, family and societal well-being, then the construct needs to be a clearly defined and conceptualized and {{there needs to be a}} way to measure it for additional research. The conceptualization of <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> used for this study originates from the lifestyle balance model (LBM) proposed by Matuska and Christiansen (2008). The model has some validity evidence when analyzed with women who have multiple sclerosis (Matuska 2 ̆ 6 Erickson, 2009), women with stress-related disorders (Håkansson 2 ̆ 6 Matuska, 2010), and with healthy working adults who also suggested financial security as a component to <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> (Wagman, Håkansson, Matuska, Björklund, 2 ̆ 6 Torbjörn, in press). I will describe a revised model of <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> and the construct validity evidence of both the revised model and a new measure of <b>life</b> <b>balance,</b> the <b>Life</b> <b>Balance</b> Inventory (LBI). <b>Life</b> <b>balance</b> is conceptualized as both congruence among desired and actual time spent in activities, and equivalence in the degree of discrepancy between desired and actual time spent across activities that meet health, relationship, challenge/interest and identity needs. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships between <b>life</b> <b>balance,</b> perceived stress, personal well-being, and need satisfaction. Four hundred and fifty eight participants representing mixed demographic groups participated in the study by completing 4 instruments. SEM results indicated that congruence, moderated by equivalence predicted lower stress, higher personal well-being and higher need satisfaction, but equivalence alone did not. Working, having children at home, and being non-white negatively moderated congruence and larger family size positively moderated congruence. This study provides initial construct validity evidence for the model and measure of <b>life</b> <b>balance.</b> Discussion questions: How does the concept of <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> relate to other aspects of well-being or health?

40|$|M. Phil. The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{investigate}} the importance of <b>balancing</b> <b>life</b> roles as essential condition for personal leadership. The problem investigated in the study was that people experience unhappiness and unfulfilled lives due to imbalance between life roles. The problem arises because people do not identify and prioritise their life roles based on values, and they do not set goals to create <b>balance</b> between <b>life</b> roles. The general aim of the study was to investigate the nature of life roles, to explore the value of prioritised and <b>balanced</b> <b>life</b> roles, and to search for ways how <b>balance</b> between <b>life</b> roles can be created, all within the personal leadership framework. The research methodology used in the study included hermeneutic and descriptive strategies. The research methods that were used included a word and concept analysis in order to clarify concepts central to the title of the study. A literature study was conducted to clarify typical life roles as well as how people experience imbalance between these roles, and how prioritised and <b>balanced</b> <b>life</b> roles can be achieved, within the personal leadership framework. The following are the most important findings of the study: Roles refer to a place in society, together with a defined code of conduct, and attitudes that society deems appropriate for somebody occupying that specific role. It was also found that roles represent responsibilities, relationships and areas of contribution. The study found that certain concepts related to life roles can cause serious imbalance in a person's life. Life roles can be categorised into personal, family, work, recreational and community roles. The impact roles have on individuals were identified. Life dimensions (physical, mental, social and spiritual) and life roles are interrelated and can not be separated. By investigating the relationship between life roles and life dimensions it was found that each life role consists of a social, mental, physical and spiritual dimension, but also that these life dimensions consist out of life roles. * It was found that value clarification in order to identify life roles, and clear goal setting for each life role are important steps in achieving balance. * The study concluded by indicating that the <b>balancing</b> of <b>life</b> roles indeed form an important part of the personal leadership process...|$|R
