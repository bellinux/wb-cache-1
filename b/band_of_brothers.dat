5|$|The battle {{reversed}} the strategic situation {{between the two}} nations' forces in the Mediterranean and entrenched the Royal Navy in the dominant position that it retained {{for the rest of}} the war. It also encouraged other European countries to turn against France, and was a factor in the outbreak of the War of the Second Coalition. Bonaparte's army was trapped in Egypt, and Royal Navy dominance off the Syrian coast contributed significantly to its defeat at the Siege of Acre in 1799 which preceded Bonaparte's return to Europe. Nelson had been wounded in the battle, but he was proclaimed a hero across Europe and was subsequently made Baron Nelson—although he was privately dissatisfied with his rewards. His captains were also highly praised and went on to form the nucleus of the legendary Nelson's <b>Band</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brothers.</b> The legend of the battle has remained prominent in the popular consciousness, with perhaps the best-known representation being Felicia Hemans' 1826 poem Casabianca.|$|E

In 2000, Hanks starred in Cast Away, which earned him a Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Drama and a fifth nomination for Academy Award for Best Actor. In 2001, he executive produced Emmy Award-winning World War II mini-series <b>Band</b> <b>of</b> <b>Brothers</b> and the romantic comedy, My Big Fat Greek Wedding.
