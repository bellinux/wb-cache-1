5|$|According to scholar Günther-Dietz Sontheimer, {{the legend}} of Banai has close {{parallels}} {{with the story of}} King Dushyanta and Shakuntala from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. The tale of another folk god Mhaskoba (Bhairava) to gain his wife Balurani or <b>Balai</b> despite obstacles is also similar to Khandoba's endeavour to win over Banai.|$|E
5|$|Atheis (English: Atheist) is a 1949 Indonesian novel {{written by}} Achdiat Karta Mihardja and {{published}} by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka. The novel, using three narrative voices, details {{the rise and fall}} of Hasan, a young Muslim who is raised to be religious but winds up doubting his faith after dealings with his Marxist–Leninist childhood friend and an anarcho-nihilist writer.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{his writing}} career, Joehana wrote independently, unattached to any {{publishing}} house. At the time, <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, a publisher {{operated by the}} Dutch colonial government, was attracting numerous Sundanese-language writers. His biographers Tini Kartini et al. suggest that Joehana rejected his contemporaries' approach, choosing to work independently rather than again {{work for the government}} which had fired him and would certainly censor his works. This, they write, is shown through the themes common in the stories: where his contemporaries focused on escapist literature and entertainment, Joehana focused on social criticism. However, Ajip Rosidi, a scholar of Sundanese literature, suggests that Joehana's refusal to use formal Sundanese meant that <b>Balai</b> Pustaka would not accept his works.|$|E
5|$|Most of Kartodikromo's fictional works {{took place}} in Bandung or Surabaya. He was an early Indonesian example of the social realist movement. Like most {{nationalist}} writers at the time, Kartodikromo preferred writing in Malay (the predecessor of modern Indonesian) rather than his native Javanese; however, he did write several pieces in Javanese. While the state-owned publisher <b>Balai</b> Pustaka was attempting to standardise Malay, Kartodikromo experimented with the language, using words, phrases, and scenes which {{had never before been}} used.|$|E
5|$|Student Hidjo {{was first}} {{published}} in 1918 as a serial in the Semarang-based daily Sinar Hindia, which Kartodikromo edited. The story was then collected in a book format and published by Masman & Stroink, a Semarang-based company, in 1919. When it was published, politically themed works were limited to smaller publishers. Works published by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies, tended to be apolitical.|$|E
5|$|Teman Doedoek {{was read}} by Soeman Hs, a Bengkalis-born teacher {{who had already}} gained {{popularity}} as a writer of detective fiction. Soeman, once a student of Kasim's, had also experimented with more humorous story-telling approaches, including in his novel Pertjobaan Setia {{as well as in}} the numerous short stories he had published through Pandji Pustaka. After the commercial success of Teman Doedoek, <b>Balai</b> Pustaka sought to release a new short story collection; thus, Soeman was contacted.|$|E
5|$|The second {{production}} by Star Film, Tjioeng Wanara {{was released on}} 18 August 1941. It was advertised heavily, emphasising {{the fact that the}} scholar Poerbatjaraka had served as the historical adviser and that the film was based on <b>Balai</b> Pustaka's version of the legend. It premiered to commercial success, but received mixed reviews. This black-and-white production, which was screened until at least 1948, is now thought lost.|$|E
5|$|Though {{initially}} {{slated for}} a July 1941 release, Tjioeng Wanara ultimately premiered at the Orion Theatre in Batavia (now Jakarta) on 18 August 1941. It was publicised extensively, often emphasising {{the role of}} Poerbatjaraka and using the name of <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, the official publishing house of the Dutch East Indies government known for its printed versions of traditional tales, in advertisements. The film was rated for all ages.|$|E
5|$|Tjioeng Wanara {{was based}} on a Sundanese legend of the same name, retold by M. A. Salmoen in a 1938 <b>Balai</b> Pustaka-published edition which was then adapted by Rd Ariffien; as such, a review in the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad found that the film {{contained}} little of the original tale except for the characters' names. The film featured traditional arts such as the Serimpi dance.|$|E
5|$|Atheis was {{published}} in 1949 by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, which had become the state publisher of independent Indonesia. A second printing followed three years later, with a cover by Basuki Resobowo. A third printing, which had several revisions to improve {{the flow of the}} story, {{was published}} in 1958. , Atheis has been reprinted thirty-three times. By 1970, Atheis had been printed in Malaysian three times. In 1972, the novel was translated by R. J. Macguire into English as part of the UNESCO Collection of Representative Works project.|$|E
5|$|Belenggu was {{submitted}} to <b>Balai</b> Pustaka {{for publication in}} 1938, but was accepted because of its perceived dissonance with public morality, particularly its portrayal of adultery and prostitution– key components of the plot– as acceptable. Eventually Belenggu {{was picked up by}} Poedjangga Baroe and published in a serial format in three editions between April and June 1940. Belenggu was the only novel published by the magazine and the first Indonesian psychological novel. In 1969, Belenggu received the first annual Literary Prize from the government of Indonesia, along with Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), Salah Asuhan, and Achdiat Karta Mihardja's Atheis (Atheist; 1949).|$|E
5|$|Later Jo signed Rd Ariffien as a screenwriter; {{the studio}} touted {{this as a}} victory, owing to Ariffien's wide network as a journalist. He wrote a single work for the company, Tjioeng Wanara, based on the Sundanese legend as retold by M. A. Salmoen in a 1938 <b>Balai</b> Pustaka-published edition; this was {{directed}} and produced by Jo. Several actors cast for the film continued with Star {{for the remainder of}} its existence, including comedian S Waldy and future film producer Elly Joenara. However, Ariffien left Star owing to dissatisfaction over Tjioeng Wanara.|$|E
5|$|Mihardja, who {{was born}} and raised in Garut, West Java, was trained as a {{journalist}} before moving to Batavia in 1941 to work for the state publisher of the Dutch East Indies, <b>Balai</b> Pustaka. While in Batavia, in 1945 he began associating with Chairil Anwar's literary group Republika. After the Proclamation of Indonesian Independence and the start of the Indonesian National Revolution, he fled to West Java and participated in events led by the Socialist Party of Indonesia led by Sutan Sjahrir. He was not an atheist, although his association with the party led some to draw that conclusion. Mihardja drew upon this background while writing Atheis.|$|E
5|$|Soeman {{began writing}} in 1923, shortly after {{finishing}} his studies. Inspired by his father, who stopped using the clan name Hasibuan in Malay-dominated Bengkalis, {{he took the}} pen name Soeman Hs. He submitted his first novel, Kasih Tak Terlarai (Undivided Love), to the state publisher <b>Balai</b> Pustaka. The book, about a young orphan who elopes with his beloved but must remarry her in disguise after she returns home, was published in 1929. Soeman received a total of 37gulden for the publication.|$|E
5|$|The {{first modern}} Indonesian novels {{published}} by the state-owned publisher of the Dutch East Indies <b>Balai</b> Pustaka were often written to show intergenerational conflict and conflict between traditional (adat) and modern culture. These novels, published beginning in the 1920s, spearheaded the use of Indonesian as a national language. This national awakening, which was also realised through political actions, was followed in July 1933 {{with the establishment of}} the literary magazine Poedjangga Baroe (New Writer). The literary magazine, which Belenggus author Armijn Pane helped establish, was the first written mainly in Indonesian and with exclusively Indonesian editors.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{authors of}} earlier works {{published}} by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, Pane {{does not use}} old Malay proverbs; he instead uses similes. Another {{way in which he}} writes differently from earlier writers is by limiting his use of the Dutch language; earlier writers such as Abdul Muis and Sutan Takdir Alisjahbana had used Dutch words– representative of the dominant colonial power– to illustrate the intellectualism of the main characters. Instead, in Belenggu Pane relies on the Indonesianised loanwords, with a glossary of difficult or uncommon words provided with early editions of the novel. Siregar wrote that Pane's language reflected the actual use of Indonesian well.|$|E
5|$|Contributors to Poedjangga Baroe were {{influenced}} by the Tachtigers, a Dutch literary movement from the 1880s. Sutherland suggests that the romantic theme prevalent in their works was adapted by the authors to escape the changing realities of Indonesian society. As opposed to earlier works published by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka such as Marah Rusli's Sitti Nurbaya (1922), which emphasized regional cultural values, prose published in Poedjangga Baroe focused on national identity, and writers included areas {{that they had never}} visited. Old themes, such as forced marriage, were abandoned. According to Sutherland, most contributors to Poedjangga Baroe kept a sense of ambivalence towards the Dutch colonial government as well as traditional culture as a central theme in their works. Although they rejected Dutch control of the archipelago, these nationalist writers embraced Western culture; Sutherland writes that some of the most staunchly nationalist writers were also the most westernized.|$|E
5|$|Sitti Nurbaya: Kasih Tak Sampai (Sitti Nurbaya: Unrealized Love, often {{abbreviated}} Sitti Nurbaya or Siti Nurbaya; original spelling Sitti Noerbaja) is an Indonesian {{novel by}} Marah Rusli. It {{was published by}} <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, the state-owned publisher and literary bureau of the Dutch East Indies, in 1922. The author {{was influenced by the}} cultures of the west Sumatran Minangkabau and the Dutch colonials, who had controlled Indonesia in various forms since the 17th century. Another influence may have been a negative experience within the author's family; after he had chosen a Sundanese woman to be his wife, Rusli's family brought him back to Padang and forced him to marry a Minangkabau woman chosen for him.|$|E
5|$|Soeman {{published}} another novel, Mentjahari Pentjoeri Anak Perawan (Seeking a Maiden's Kidnapper), in 1932. It follows Sir Joon, a {{man whose}} betrothal to Nona was called off after her father, Gadi, was offered a higher bride price. When Nona is apparently kidnapped, Joon offers his services to help find her. He builds distrust between Gadi and Nona's would-be husband, and ultimately that betrothal too is called off. Afterwards Joon leaves the village with Nona, whom he had taken from her home, and the couple lives happily in Singapore. For this novel, again published by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, Soeman received 75 gulden. Over the subsequent decades, it became his most popular publication, {{and it has been}} identified as the first detective novel in the Indonesian literary canon.|$|E

5|$|This was {{followed}} by Pertjobaan Setia (A Test of Faithfulness) in 1931, a novel about {{a young man named}} Sjamsoeddin who is required to go on the hajj before he can marry Hajjah Salwiah, a rich merchant's daughter. When Sjamsoeddin returns from his trip, he suffers an accident and is tricked by a man who lusts after Salwiah. Ultimately, however, Sjamsoeddin's friend Djamin is able to reveal the treachery, allowing Sjamsoeddin and Salwiah to marry. The following year, two translations of Soeman's novels were published by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka; Kasih Tak Terlarai was translated into Javanese as Asih tan Kena Pisah by Soehardja, while Pertjobaan Setia was translated into Sundanese as Tjotjoba by Martaperdana.|$|E
25|$|The Sultan Abdul Halim Mu'adzam Shah Gallery {{building}} was the Alor Setar High Court, {{before it was}} moved to Kompleks Mahkamah Alor Setar in Suka Menanti. This building {{is located at the}} junction of Jalan Putera, adjacent to the <b>Balai</b> Nobat. This {{building was}} built for the existing <b>Balai</b> Seni. This building was built on Rabiulawal 1341 Hijrah equivalent to November 1922.|$|E
25|$|Initially the {{function}} of the building was as the <b>Balai</b> Rong Seri or <b>Balai</b> Penghadapan (audience hall), that was situated at the back area of the Kota Setar Palace complex (Istana Kota Setar). The original building was built in 1735 by HRH Sultan Muhammad Jiwa Zainal Adilin II, the 19th Sultan of Kedah. The pillars, roofs and floors were made of wood.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, the Jakarta City Hall {{expanded}} {{with construction}} of Building C (<b>Balai</b> Agung) and 4-floored building F.|$|E
25|$|After this {{generally}} favourable feedback, Hamka {{decided to}} publish it with a private publisher owned by his friend M. Syarkawi; by using a private publisher he avoided the censorship imposed on authors by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, the official publisher of the colonial government. A second printing was with Syarkawi's publisher, then the next five printings, beginning in 1951, were by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, which had become the state-owned publisher of Indonesia after independence in 1945. The eighth printing, in 1961, was published by Nusantara in Jakarta, with printings after that by Bulan Bintang. The work has also had several printings in Malaysia.|$|E
25|$|Although the Khateek (butchers) are {{generally}} {{viewed as a}} higher caste than Bhangis, the latter refuse to offer cleaning services to Khateeks, believing that their profession renders them unclean. They also consider the <b>Balai,</b> Dhobi, Dholi and Mogya as unclean and do not associate with them.|$|E
25|$|The {{museum is}} also a {{research}} centre which specialises on Kedah's cultural history. Before the present premises were built in 1936, the museum – officially opened by the then Kedah Mentri Besar Tan Sri Tunku Ismail Tunku Yahya (Tunku indera Setia), on 3 February 1957 – was located in the <b>Balai</b> Besar (Grand Hall).|$|E
25|$|During World War II, the {{building}} {{was used for the}} office of , headed by a sityoo. After independence, the name of {{the building}} became the <b>Balai</b> Agung Pemerintahan Nasional Kota Djakarta ("Great Hall of the National Administration of Djakarta City") with Suwiryo as its first native mayor. Since then, Jakarta's administration continued to be based in the same building.|$|E
25|$|The Indonesian socialist {{literary}} critic Bakri Siregar wrote that Van der Wijck was Hamka's best work, noting with interest {{the way in}} which Zainuddin writes about politics after losing Hayati. The Indonesian {{literary critic}} Maman S. Mahayana found Van der Wijck to have good characterisation and use suspense better than contemporary <b>Balai</b> Pustaka publications; he suggested that this was a benefit of the work originally being published as a serial.|$|E
25|$|In Kelantan, the Kelantanese Chinese see {{themselves}} as either Cina Kampung (village Chinese) or Cina Bandar (town Chinese). Famous Chinese villages in Kelantan include Kampung Tok'kong (300-year-old temple), Batu Jong, Kampung Jelatok, Kampung Joh, Kampung Temangan, Kampung Mata Ayer, Kampung Tawang, Kampung <b>Balai,</b> and Gua Musang. Descendants of the earlier waves of small-scale migration are known as Orang Cina kita (our very own Chinese) and the elders are seen as Orang Kelantan betul (true Kelantanese).|$|E
25|$|Jakarta City Hall (Indonesian <b>Balai</b> Kota DKI Jakarta) is {{the seat}} of Jakarta City government. The complex of Jakarta City Hall {{contains}} the official office of {{the governor and the}} vice governor of Jakarta, and the main administrative office. The Jakarta City Hall is located south of Merdeka Square. The complex consists of several buildings used for the government work of the city of Jakarta. The article covers the historic Jakarta City Hall complex located in Jalan Medan Merdeka Selatan.|$|E
25|$|Di Bawah Lindungan Ka'bah was {{published}} by <b>Balai</b> Pustaka in 1938. The company generally refused religious-themed works, fearing that such works would cause developments against Dutch colonial priorities; however, they accepted Hamka's novel as they considered it a romance with a religious background. Hamka published a further four novels during his stay in Medan, including Tenggelamnya Kapal van der Wijck (The Sinking of the van Der Wijck; 1938), widely considered his best. Starting with the seventh printing, the novel {{was published}} by Bulan Bintang.|$|E
25|$|Early modern Indonesian {{literature}} {{originates in}} Sumatran tradition. <b>Balai</b> Pustaka, the government bureau for popular literature, was instituted around 1920 {{to promote the}} development of indigenous literature, it adopted Malay as the preferred common medium for Indonesia. Important figures in modern Indonesian literature include: Dutch author Multatuli, who criticised treatment of the Indonesians under Dutch colonial rule; Sumatrans Mohammad Yamin and Hamka, who were influential pre-independence nationalist writers and politicians; and proletarian writer Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Indonesia's most famous novelist. Pramoedya earned several accolades, and was frequently discussed as Indonesia's and Southeast Asia's best candidate for a Nobel Prize in Literature.|$|E
25|$|Armed {{clashes with}} the British, Dutch, and Japanese {{remained}} {{at a low}} level {{for the next two}} months until rumours that the Dutch were about to attempt a landing started spreading viral among the locals. On 3 March 1946, thousands of armed pemuda surrounded the palace in Tanjung <b>Balai</b> in response to the wide dissemination of reports that claimed that the kerajaan had formed a Comité van Ontvangst (reception committee) to welcome the Dutch. The outbreak of violence between the kerajaan and the armed pemuda hence marked the start of the 1946 East Sumatra Social Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Terengganu, {{along with}} Kelantan {{is known as}} the cradle of the Malay civilization in Peninsular Malaysia. There are various {{traditional}} dances in the state such as the Ulek Mayang, Rodat, Saba, <b>Balai,</b> Nur Sakti and others, some even predates the arrival of Islam in the region. Terengganu is also one of few states to adopt Gamelan as part of their traditional theatre (after Riau and Pahang), the Terengganu Gamelan has developed a distinct identity from Sundanese and Javanese Gamelan. The Gamelan was originally bought from Pahang and later to Terengganu and played only during royal occasions. Today the Gamelan is part of the state's cultural heritage.|$|E
25|$|The Spectacular Show, {{which lasted}} eleven weeks, each finalist {{performed}} a song live (two {{in the top}} 4 and top 3 and three in the finale) in prime time with a weekly theme at <b>Balai</b> Sarbini Concert Hall in Jakarta in front of live audiences. Unlike American Idol, Indonesian Idol's Result Show is conducted about 1-hour after the Spectacular Show. For the Grand Final, the Result Show was conducted 7 days after the Grand Final. In the Result Show, some finalists who get the fewest votes are put in the bottom three or bottom two. Each week, finalist with the fewest votes is sent home. This process was repeated each week until the one remaining contestant is declared the winner.|$|E
