They also announced plans to publish 11 of the other novels, on a print-on-demand basis.|$|E
5|$|The {{work has}} never <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print. Its ongoing legacy {{encompasses}} many adaptations for stage, screen, radio, board games, and video games. Several of these adaptations have received critical recognition {{on their own}} merits.|$|E
5|$|A Canticle for Leibowitz {{is based}} on three short stories Miller contributed to The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. It is the only novel {{published}} by the author during his lifetime. (His follow-up work, Saint Leibowitz and the Wild Horse Woman, was published posthumously in 1997.) Considered one of the classics of science fiction, it has never <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print and has seen over 25 reprints and editions. Appealing to mainstream and genre critics and readers alike, it won the 1961 Hugo Award for best science fiction novel.|$|E

5|$|A typical Robinsonade– a {{genre of}} fiction {{inspired}} by Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe– {{and one of}} the most popular of its type, the book first went on sale in late 1857 and has never <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print. Among the novel's major themes are the civilising effect of Christianity, 19th-century British imperialism in the South Pacific, and the importance of hierarchy and leadership. It was the inspiration for William Golding's dystopian novel Lord of the Flies (1954), which inverted the morality of The Coral Island; in Ballantyne's story the children encounter evil, but in Lord of the Flies evil is within them.|$|E
5|$|Aside from {{scientific}} work, he was {{a social}} activist who was critical of what he {{considered to be an}} unjust social and economic system (capitalism) in 19th-century Britain. His interest in natural history resulted in his being one of the first prominent scientists to raise concerns over the environmental impact of human activity. He was also a prolific author who wrote on both scientific and social issues; his account of his adventures and observations during his explorations in Singapore, Indonesia and Malaysia, The Malay Archipelago, was both popular and highly regarded. Since its publication in 1869 it has never <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print.|$|E
5|$|Boycott {{has responded}} to these accusations by {{pointing}} out that Lillee had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> cricket for 21 months suffering from a serious back complaint and that Thomson had not played in Tests for 23 months before the 1974–5 Ashes series, since an unsuccessful debut Test against Pakistan (Thomson's match figures were 0–110). Furthermore, he was dismissed for 99 in the first innings against the West Indies at Port-of-Spain in 1973–74 and scored 112 in the second, followed by a career-best 261 not out against a West Indies Board President's XI. All of these teams included Roberts, with a young Holding representing the Board XI.|$|E

5|$|Marshall {{was inaugurated}} as Governor of Indiana on January 11, 1909. Since his party had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> power for many years, its initial {{objective}} was to appoint as many Democrats as possible to patronage positions. Marshall tried to avoid becoming {{directly involved in the}} patronage system. He allowed the party's different factions to have positions and appointed very few of his own choices. He allowed Taggart to manage the process and pick the candidates, but signed off himself on the official appointments. Although his position on patronage kept peace in his party, it prevented him from building a strong political base.|$|E
5|$|Michel de Nostredame (depending on the source, 14 or 21 December 1503 – 2 July 1566), usually Latinised as Nostradamus, was a French {{physician}} and reputed seer who published collections of prophecies that have since become widely famous. He {{is best known}} for his book Les Propheties, the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Since the publication of this book, which has rarely <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print since his death, Nostradamus has attracted a following that, along with much of the popular press, credits him with predicting many major world events.|$|E

5|$|Phillips, by now divorced, {{spent the}} {{following}} years on a downward spiral which included, by her own account, spending $120,000 on cocaine, before entering therapy to recover from her addiction. Then, in 1988, having <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Hollywood for eleven years, she sold all her assets to produce The Beat, about {{a kid in a}} tough neighbourhood trying to teach poetry to local gangs. It was a critical and commercial disaster, grossing less than $5,000 at the box office, and Phillips turned to penning her scathing memoir to escape her financial difficulties.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} {{pervasive}} influence on Walpole was Walter Scott, whose romanticism {{is reflected in}} much of the later writer's fiction. Such was Walpole's love of Scott that he liked to think of himself as the latter's reincarnation. He amassed the largest collection in Britain of Scott manuscripts and early editions, and constantly reread the novels. With the Herries stories Walpole restored the popularity of the historical novel, a form for which Scott was famous but which had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fashion for decades. The Herries series begins in the 18th century and follows a Lakeland family through the generations up to modern times.|$|E
5|$|The 2010 box set Collaborations was one {{of several}} reissue {{projects}} celebrating Shankar's 90th birthday. It compiles three studio albums that he and Harrison worked on together between 1973 and 1996: Shankar Family & Friends (1974), Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India (1976) and Chants of India (1997). The first two of these albums had long <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print, and their inclusion in the box set marked the debut CD release for both titles. Disc four contains a previously unissued concert film from 1974, titled Music Festival from India – Live at the Royal Albert Hall.|$|E

5|$|The Eastern Catholic Churches {{share common}} {{patrimony}} and liturgical rites as their counterparts, including Eastern Orthodox and other Eastern Christian churches who {{are no longer}} in communion with the Holy See. These include churches that historically developed in Russia, Caucasus, the Balkans, North Eastern Africa, India and the Middle East. The Eastern Catholic Churches are groups of faithful who have either never <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> communion with the Holy See or who have restored communion with it at the cost of breaking communion with their associates of the same tradition.|$|E
5|$|The book's initial {{critical}} reception was modest, but it {{was popular}} with the public and has never <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print.

5|$|The {{commander}} of 5th Mounted Brigade decided to retire towards the Suez Canal, {{and the two}} squadrons from Romani joined him, abandoning much equipment to ride overnight to Bir el Nuss. Wiggin arrived at Dueidar at 09:00 on 24 April with two squadrons. The 5th Mounted Brigade had been completely surprised; its commander and his important reserve force had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> position at a critical time following false intelligence, and could not support his regiments. The {{three and a half}} squadrons at Oghratina and Katia were decimated—almost all were killed, wounded or captured.|$|E

40|$|<b>Being</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the loop}} <b>is</b> {{a form of}} partial ostracism that leads to lower need {{satisfaction}} (Jones, Carter-Sowell, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, 2009). Research has shown that people experience lower need satisfaction when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture (Iannone, Kelly, 2 ̆ 6 Williams, in preparation). Five studies expanded on previous research by exploring theoretical issues and potential boundary conditions. Study 1 developed a new method and explored theoretical foundations <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture - whether being unfamiliar makes people feel worse or whether being familiar makes people feel better. This study also looked at whether {{people need to be}} told that others recognize the pop culture stimuli. Study 2 explored whether the feeling of failure associated with feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop can be eliminated, or whether they coexist. Studies 3 - 5 explored potential boundary conditions <b>of</b> being <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture: who people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop from, what people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on, and when people <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop. These studies replicated previous findings of lower need satisfaction when <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on pop culture while also demonstrating that 1) being unfamiliar with pop culture makes people feel worse rather than being familiar with pop culture making people feel better 2) failure and feeling <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop may coexist and 3) individuals feel bad regardless <b>of</b> who they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop from, what they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop on, and when they <b>are</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the loop. These findings suggest that being unfamiliar with pop culture may be extremely negative, as no factors seem to ameliorate the negative effects...|$|R

5|$|Walpole's {{works have}} not been {{completely}} neglected in recent years. The Herries stories have seldom <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> print, and in 2014 WorldCat listed a dozen recent reissues of Walpole's works, including The Wooden Horse, The Dark Forest, The Secret City, Jeremy, and The Cathedral. In 2011 the BBC broadcast a reappraisal of Walpole, The Walpole Chronicle, presented by Eric Robson. In 2013 a new stage version of Rogue Herries was presented by the Theatre by the Lake company in Walpole's adopted home of Keswick. The BBC speculated that this could mark a revival in interest in his works.|$|E
