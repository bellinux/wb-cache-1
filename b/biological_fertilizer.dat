Experimental factors consisted of phosphorus chemical fertilizers at four levels(0, 90, 135 and 180 kg ha- 1) and bio-fertilizer at four levels (non-inoculation, inoculating with Azotobacter chroococcum, Pseudomonas Putida and Azotobacter plus Pseudomonas). Results of analysis variance showed that using chemical fertilizer significantly effected grain yield, harvest index, biological yield, plant height and protein content. The highest grain and biological yields were produced by applying 180 kg ha- 1, while its effects on other traits were not significantly different from that of 135 kg ha- 1. <b>Biological</b> <b>fertilizers,</b> on the other hand increased grain yield, harvest index, biological yield, plant height and protein content as compared to non inoculation treatment.

Because of special priority of the medicinal plants production in sustainable agricultural systems and lack of studies on assessment of different sources of fertilizer on basil plants, an experiment was conducted at Research Station, Faculty of Agriculture, Ferdowsi University of Mashhad, Iran, in 2009.

40|$|A block {{experiment}} was undertaken {{to determine the}} effects of biological and chemical (NPK 15 : 15 : 15) fertilizers on the growth and yield of shallot cultivation in Mahasakham University, Mahasarakham province, Northeast Thailand. Six biological fertilizers were developed from BBF (basically biological fertilizer: 45 g cattle manure + 45 g rice bran + 20 mL of molasses + 10 mL of EM + 10 L of dechlorinated water) and used in this experiment. Chemical and biological fertilizers showed insignificant at a confidence level of 95 % on the growth and yield of shallots. Increasing biological and chemical fertilizers concentration in this experiment had no significant effect on shallot growth and yield. Except control (without fertilizer), average shallot total weight with leaves and number of leaves per plant in all treatments were ranged between 9. 885 - 12. 024 g and 19. 095 - 21. 840 leaves, respectively. Average shallot total weight with leaves and number of leaves per plant obtained in this experimental were coincided to the Thai market standard. Growth and yield of these shallots showed significant different to the control (5. 525 g of weight and 15. 625 leaves per plant). Supplemented golden apple snails (Pomacea canaliculat) into BBF provided higher NO 3 � contents (4. 28 - 4. 68 %).

30|$|The {{findings}} {{of the present study}} suggest that the application of <b>biological</b> <b>fertilizers</b> had promising effects on dill, and this is in agreement with infrequent research studies on the effect of these fertilizers on medicinal plants. Therefore, it is recommended that the mineral nitrogen and phosphate fertilizers be replaced with biofertilizers to reduce production costs and stop damages to the environment due to the use of chemical fertilizers especially nitrogen as nitrate. The application of biofertilizer combined with growth hormones such as auxin, gibberellin, and cytokines promoted root growth that improved crop yields. Generally, it seems that the use of biofertilizers or combinations of biofertilizer and chemical fertilizer could improve dill performance in addition to reduction of environmental pollution.|$|R

An experiment was conducted using a factorial arrangement based on a complete block randomized design with four replications. The results showed that by increasing Growing Degree Days (GDD), the Leaf Area Index (LAI) of cv. Williams was relatively higher than that of Line no. 17, whereas Line no. 17 had significantly more chlorophyll (a, b and total) than that of cv. Williams. The highest and lowest weight measurements of 1000 seeds were recorded when fertilizers b(4) and b(2) were applied. Overall, Line no. 17 had a higher total yield of seeds than that of cv. Williams. The application of fertilizer b(1), b(3) and b(5), resulted in the highest seed protein content. In addition, the highest and lowest measurements of seed oil content for cv. Williams, were recorded when fertilizers b(2) and b(3) were applied. Seeds of Line no. 17 had (a) higher phosphorus and zinc content than of cv. Williams, whereas cv. Williams had (a) higher iron and manganese content than of Line no. 17, regardless of the applied fertilizer. K content of seeds had the highest and lowest mean values when b(3) and b(5) fertilizers were applied, respectively. In conclusion, the implementation of <b>biological</b> <b>fertilizers</b> (especially b(3) and b(4)) could be a useful means for minimizing the chemical inputs during soybean cultivation, allowing at the same time for high yield and high quality products...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: {{sustainable}} {{development and the}} environment are interconnected. Sustainable agriculture is continuous utilization of a farm with respect to various aspects of environmental conditions by using fewer inputs (other than Bio-fertilizers). Phosphorus {{is one of the}} essential elements for the plants. Management of soil is possible by using <b>biological</b> <b>fertilizers</b> pillar of sustainable agriculture and providing some of the phosphorus needed by plants via bio-fertilizers. Phosphorus deficiency is extremely effective on the plant growth and productivity. The application of phosphorus fertilizers is expensive and dangerous. In addition, phosphorus in the soilmay become insoluble and will be unavailable to the plants. Studies showed that phosphate solubilizing bacteria in the soil rhizosphere are active and by root exudates solve insoluble phosphates such as tricalcium phosphate, and form absorbable P for plant. Consequently, the use of microbial fertilizers could reduce excessive use of chemical fertilizers and lead to decrease their harmful effects and protect the environment and conservation of available resources. The <b>biological</b> phosphate <b>fertilizer</b> industry uses sugar beet molasses as a binder and drying granules at high temperatures. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the durability of the bacteria in molasses at high temperature. Materials and Methods: This study was designed as completely randomized design in a factorial arrangement. 10 isolates were selected and the ratios of 50...|$|R
