25|$|Zhuge Liang might <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> Fa Zheng, as {{inferred}} from an incident during the Hanzhong Campaign. During one battle, when the odds turned against Liu Bei, Liu's subjects urged their lord to retreat but he stubbornly refused. They {{did not dare}} to advise him again for fear of incurring his wrath. Fa Zheng rushed forth and {{stood in front of}} Liu Bei when Cao Cao's forces rained arrows on their camp. Liu Bei told Fa Zheng to stay under cover to avoid the arrows, but Fa insisted on braving the arrows with his lord. Liu Bei then decided to retreat together with Fa Zheng.|$|E
500|$|In 2015, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly called Tyrion's {{meeting with}} Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) an [...] "iconic meetup" [...] that [...] "delighted fans, who were universally {{enthusiastic}} (for once!) about the showrunners making a narrative move not yet found in George R.R. Martin’s novels." [...] Dinklage {{said in the}} interview, [...] "That’s {{the great thing about}} my character: He’s been everywhere. He’s the only character that goes searching. He’s been to The Wall and now he has to find the dragons." [...] Benioff and Weiss said that the conversation between Tyrion and Daenerys focused on the parallels between their lives, as Tyrion had a [...] "lot of empathy" [...] toward Daenerys for being an orphan, like himself, and both had [...] "terrible fathers". Tyrion realized that Varys might <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> Daenerys being the [...] "last hope for Westeros". Benioff and Weiss also suggested that Tyrion believes that Daenerys could bring him [...] "back into power".|$|E
500|$|In Illinois v. Gates, the Supreme Court {{established}} that courts should apply a [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] test {{to determine whether}} an anonymous tip is sufficiently reliable to provide probable cause to issue an arrest warrant. Although officers in Gates did not personally witness any criminal activity, the Supreme Court held that the anonymous tip in question was reliable, because officers could verify several events predicted by the anonymous tip. Seven years after Gates, the Supreme Court held in Alabama v. White that an anonymous tip was sufficiently reliable to provide reasonable suspicion to justify a temporary detention, because the tip accurately predicted several key details. Although the Court conceded that White was a [...] "close case", the tip in question [...] "exhibited sufficient indicia of reliability" [...] to justify a temporary detention. The Court explained that [...] if [...] "an informant is shown to <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> some things, he is probably right about other facts that he has alleged, including {{the claim that the}} object of the tip is engaged in criminal activity." ...|$|E

500|$|Gold's {{plan was}} to set a fire at the Mayor's office with Emma there, knowing her {{conscience}} would force her to save Regina and look like a hero. This goes off perfectly, making Emma the town favorite going into the debate. When she finds out that Gold did this, Emma realizes Henry might <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> evil not playing by the rules. At the debate, Sidney explains what would make him the best sheriff following Regina's script to the letter. Emma reveals {{to the public that}} Gold set the fire, demonstrating her own honesty and integrity as well as Gold's ruthlessness. Later that evening at Granny's Cafe, Emma consoles herself with liquor when Henry walks in with the walkie talkies, saying that he was proud of her and they might continue [...] "Operation Cobra." [...] Regina, Archie (Raphael Sbarge), Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin) and Sidney arrive to tell Emma she was elected Sheriff. Regina gives her the badge and admits they have one thing in common: their distrust of Gold. Emma receives a visit from her new ally who reveals the rest of his plan. Gold knew Emma would {{do the right thing and}} tell everyone what he did, winning her the election. He also tells her that while the town feared Regina, they feared him more. In standing up to him, Emma became even more compelling to the townsfolk than when she rescued Regina. Now that Emma is Sheriff, Gold expects to be paid back for his favors.|$|E
2500|$|For his part, CNW's Art Spinella says {{environmental}} campaigners may <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> SUVs, but hybrids are {{an expensive}} {{part of the}} automotive picture. The vehicle {{at the top of}} his environmentally-friendly list is the Scion XB because it is easy to build, cheap to run and recycle and carries a cost of 49 cents a mile over its lifetime.|$|E
2500|$|Frederick {{incorporates}} jargon {{from the}} est {{training in the}} work. He alternates between referring to the reader as [...] "an ass" [...] or [...] "baby". The book contains short segments on various themes titled: [...] "Total Acceptance and Responsibility", [...] "Winners and Losers", and [...] "The Game of Life". Chapter headings include: [...] "How to Get All the Cheese in Life" [...] and [...] "How to Get Where You Really Want to Go in Life". Frederick {{emphasizes the importance of}} self-awareness, writing: [...] "You are the Supreme being, in Spirit". He attempts to convince the reader that life should be considered a game, and that it is more desirable to win at a goal than it is to <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> it. Frederick's thesis is that individuals cause all events which occur in their lives, and that they should work to consciously control their circumstances.|$|E

60|$|Maggie {{began to}} think that Tom must <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> the gipsies: they must {{certainly}} be thieves, unless the man meant to return her thimble by-and-by. All thieves, except Robin Hood, were wicked people.|$|E
60|$|Uncle Fact was {{so angry}} and talked so loud, that Fancy felt frightened and bewildered; and began to think he might <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> the mermaid part, though she hated {{to give up the}} little romance.|$|E
60|$|But she <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> {{the main}} point. Alice came, and Dan could see {{with his own}} weary eyes {{that she had not}} slept either.|$|R

6000|$|... "'Pon my oath, Goble, I {{gave you}} credit for more penetration," [...] he drawled; [...] "you may <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> the Scotchman, but your {{longshore}} lout has had both birth and breeding, or I know nothing." ...|$|E
6000|$|Austin smiled. [...] "To {{take a risk}} I'm {{responsible}} for? I think not. I went sufficiently far when I {{brought some}} of them here. Besides, it's comforting to remember you mayn't <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> the thing being contagious, after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, ma'am, I {{guess you}} must <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> his looking like Johnny. I must say I never {{could see the}} resemblance, but {{it may well be}} there, for he--that very fellow there--and Johnny are first cousins. Their mothers were sisters!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Visiting Jenny's grave {{one day in}} 1982, he {{reflects}} {{on the idea of}} fate and destiny, wondering if Lieutenant Dan <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> people having their own destiny, or if his mother <b>was</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> description of life as floating around accidentally like on a breeze. Forrest eventually decides [...] "maybe it's both, maybe both are happening at the same time." [...] He leaves Jenny a letter from Little Forrest and tells her [...] "If there's anything you need, I won't be far away." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No doubt you'll <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> yon fellow Davie," [...] {{he agreed}} sombrely, and {{purposely}} he added things {{that must have}} outraged Darnley's every feeling as king and as husband. Then he stated the terms on which Darnley might count upon his aid.|$|E
6000|$|Now I {{think that}} the passage may imply a {{repetition}} of the words with which it begins, after 'nor'--thus--'nor am I used to prayer,' &c. Either you or I may <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> it, and either 'or' or 'nor' may be grammatical. At least, so I pray.[51] ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{jumped off}} her lap; {{it was horrible}} to hear her. [...] "Oh," [...] I said, [...] "can you <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>about</b> it?" [...] Miss Jillgall jumped up too. She has foreign ways of shrugging her {{shoulders}} and making signs with her hands. On this occasion she laid {{both hands on the}} upper part of her dress, just below her throat, and mysteriously shook her head.|$|E
6000|$|... "The last quills Gilby took in {{contained}} brass filings, and {{the firm}} wrote off their nominal value against our commission. Gilby had been drinking cocktails all that day.

You have heard about them, Maxwell?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Pett started. She {{remembered that}} she had used almost that very {{expression}} to Ann.
