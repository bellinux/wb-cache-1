40|$|Feeding {{cattle manure}} (CM) for {{ruminants}} may reduce feed costs for smallholders {{and provide a}} partial solution to environment problems for large dairy herds. Feeding value of ensiling CM with molasses (MO), <b>bakery</b> <b>by-products</b> (BBP) and tallow (TW) was evaluated. Five Suffolk male lambs were fed with different kind of CM as follow: 1) control: CM and MO; 2) LBBP: CM and low level of BBP; 3) HBBP: CM and high level of BBP; 4) LTW: CM, BBP and low level of TW; and 5) HTW: CM, BBP and high level of TW. Ensiling CM with BBP had the lowest silage losses. Silages were part of diets, which were fed to lambs fitted with ruminal cannulas. Nutrient intake and N balance {{did not differ in}} lambs across all experimental diets, but the NDF digestion of diets with BBP and TW was lower than with MO or BBP. Ensiling CM with BBP offered less silage losses as compared to MO...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 263 pigs (PIC 337 × 1050; {{initially}} 77. 8 lb) {{were used in}} a 102 -d study {{to determine the effects}} of dietary <b>bakery</b> <b>by-product</b> on pig growth performance and carcass quality.

40|$|SUMMARY The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the characteristics of silages prepared with a dry <b>bakery</b> <b>by-product</b> hydrated with acid whey or water associated or not at urea. The trial was a 3 (hydration at three moisture levels: 250, 300, and 350 mL kg&# 8722; 1 of by-product) × 3 (three application rates of urea: 0, 5, and 10 g kg&# 8722; 1 of by-product) × 2 (liquid used at hydration: acid whey or water) factorial arrangement. Mini-silos were used as experimental silos and remained closed for 30 days. Overall, silages hydrated with acid whey had higher (P< 0. 01) production of lactic (19. 6 vs. 18. 5 g kg&# 8722; 1 of dry matter [DM]), acetic (2. 5 vs. 1. 8 g kg&# 8722; 1 of DM) and propionic acid (8. 0 vs. 5. 4 g kg&# 8722; 1 of DM), and lower (P< 0. 05) fungi counts (5. 35 and 5. 01 cfu g&# 8722; 1 of fresh silage) compared to silages hydrated with water. Increased hydration led to the higher production of total acids (P< 0. 01), decreasing silage pH; but increased hydration reduced DM recovery (P< 0. 01). Silages hydrated with water and acid whey at 250 mL kg&# 8722; 1 and combined at 5 and 10 g kg&# 8722; 1 of urea exhibited higher DM recovery (P< 0. 05). Silages of a dry <b>bakery</b> <b>by-product</b> hydrated with acid whey had a better fermentation pattern and could represent a practical strategy to avoid discarding both by-products into environment...|$|R
40|$|The {{experiment}} {{was conducted in}} a commercial facility {{to determine the effects}} of added Zn on the performance of finishing pigs fed Ractopamine HCl (RAC; Paylean®; Elanco Animal Health, Greenfield, IN). Pigs were randomly assigned to pens based on gender (14 barrow pens, 11 gilt pens, and 23 mixed-gender pens), with 25 to 28 pigs per pen. Previously, pens of pigs were assigned to treatments containing 0, 7. 5, or 15 % <b>bakery</b> <b>by-product</b> in a completely randomized design while balancing for initial BW and gender. On d 75, treatments were implemented {{to determine the effects of}} adding 50 ppm Zn from ZnO on finishing pig performance. A total of 1, 234 pigs (PIC 337 × 1050; average BW 224. 6 lb) were used in a 28 -d study. Pens of pigs were randomly assigned to diets with and without 50 ppm added Zn from zinc oxide (ZnO) and balanced by BW, <b>bakery</b> <b>by-product,</b> and gender. All diets contained 5 ppm RAC and 83 ppm Zn from ZnO provided by the trace mineral premix. There were 24 pens per treatment. Overall (d 75 to 102), no differences (P > 0. 22) in growth performance or carcass characteristics were observed when pigs were fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn compared with the RAC control. For pigs subsampled on d 84, pigs fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn had decreased (P < 0. 05) edge belly thickness compared with pigs fed the control. For pigs subsampled on d 102, pigs fed diets with 50 ppm added Zn had decreased (P < 0. 02) backfat thickness, belly weight, and edge belly thickness; a tendency for decreased (P < 0. 07) middle belly thickness; and increased (P < 0. 01) percentage lean compared with pigs fed the RAC control. In contrast with our previous research, these data indicate that adding 50 ppm Zn from ZnO to finishing pig diets containing RAC did not improve overall performance. Consistent with the earlier research, income over feed cost (IOFC) was numerically increased with the addition of Zn...|$|R
30|$|Inadequate {{supply of}} good-quality feed {{is the main}} factor {{hindering}} the progress of animal production in many developing countries, especially during dry season. This has necessitated the use of non-conventional feed resources {{in order to meet}} livestock requirement for nutrients and enhance their performance. Anything that is been excreted by ruminants is considered to be non-digestible; however, there are significantly high amounts of soluble materials in the manure and these can be utilised by ruminants (Moo-Young and Chahal 1979). The use of cattle manure as ruminants feed will reduce feeding cost as well as animal waste pollution, and it will also provide nutrients to the animals (Martínez-Avalos et al. 1998; Sarwar et al. 2011). Different processing methods had been used in processing cattle manure as feedstuff but, the most commonly used is ensiling methods (Sarwar et al. 2006). Cattle manure was ensiled at different proportions up to 50  % inclusion with different agro-by-products. Cattle manure was ensiled with cane molasses–urea mixture-treated wheat straw (Sarwar et al. 2006, 2011); it was also ensiled with cane molasses–urea mixture and corn stover (Marti´nez-Avalos et al. 1998) and the same mixture without urea (Cobos et al. 1997). It was also ensiled with <b>bakery</b> <b>by-products</b> and tallow (Bórquez et al. 2010). These were fed to buffalos, cattle and small ruminants. The results showed an increase in dry matter, organic matter, crude protein and NDF intake; however, {{there were no significant differences}} in nutrients’ apparent digestibilities.|$|E
40|$|The {{objectives}} of this experiment were to investigate effects of dietary replacement of maize with bakery by-product (BB) {{with or without}} enzyme supplementation {{on the performance of}} laying hens and egg quality characteristics. A total number of one hundred and eighty 87 -week-old Hy-Line Leghorn hens, with an average laying rate of 56. 7 ± 3. 8 % (late production phase) and 1470 ± 14 g live body weight, were weighed and distributed between 30 cages with almost same egg production (EP) level among the cages. Six iso-caloric and iso-nitrogenous diets were formulated (ME= 2900 kcal/kg and crude protein= 15. 20 g/ 100 g diet) based on the catalogue of Hy-line. The experiment was conducted as a 3 × 2 factorial arrangement of treatments including three replacement levels (0, 50, and 100 %) of corn with dried bakery byproduct replacement) and enzyme supplementation (0 and 0. 06 g/ 100 g diet of Hemicell®, a commercial ?-mannanase-based cocktail enzyme product). Each of 6 experimental diet fed hens in 5 replicates with 6 birds per each replicate (cage). The hens? performance including hen-day egg production% (EP), egg weight (EW) and feed intake (FI) was measured for 4 weeks and egg mass (EM, g/hen/day) as well as feed conversion ratio (FCR, g feed: g egg) was calculated. The data was analyzed based on completely randomized design using GLM procedure of SAS. Replacing dietary corn with BB had no significant effect on egg production (%), except in week 2. Egg production in group of 100 % corn-replacement in week 2 was lower than the other dietary groups. However, the overall EP for weeks 1 - 4 was not significantly affected by replacing dietary corn with BB. In addition, EM and FCR were not significantly affected by dietary treatment. Egg weight was affected by dietary cornreplacement in weeks 1 and 2; however, no significant difference was found in weeks 3 and 4. Egg quality characteristics were not affected by dietary treatment. Enzyme supplementation had no significant effect on performance of hens and egg quality traits. From the results of this experiment it can be concluded that dietary corn can be totally replaced with <b>bakery</b> <b>by-products</b> with no adverse effect on performance and egg quality. In addition, ?-mannanase has no beneficial effect on performance of hens fed on corn- or bakery by-productbased diets...|$|E
40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 245 pigs (PIC 1050 × 337, {{initially}} 106 lb) {{were used in}} a 90 -d study {{to determine the effects}} of MicroSource S (DSM Nutritional Products Inc., Parsippany, NJ) and diet type on growth performance, carcass traits, fecal consistency, pen cleaning time, and postcleaning microbial load in growing-finishing pigs raised under commercial conditions. Pens of pigs were balanced by initial weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 dietary treatments in a completely randomized design with 25 to 26 pigs per pen and 8 replications per treatment.

40|$|A {{total of}} 1, 253 pigs (PIC 1050 × 337; {{initially}} 45 lb) {{were used in}} a 104 -d study to evaluate the effects of using a wet-dry (WD) or conventional dry (CD) feeder on growth performance of growing-finishing pigs. At {{the start of the}} trial, pens of pigs were weighed and randomly allotted to 1 of the 2 feeder types. The CD feeder was a single-sided, 56 -in. -wide, stainless steel feeder (Thorp Equipment, Inc., Thorp, WI) with 4 14 -in. feeding spaces and a 4. 25 -in. -deep trough. A cup waterer in pens using CD feeders ensured ad libitum access to water as well as feed. The WD feeder was double-sided (15 -in. -wide feeder opening on each side) with a single nipple waterer (Crystal Springs, GroMaster, Inc., Omaha, NE), and the feeder was the only source of water. All pigs were fed the same corn-soybean meal diets containing 30 % <b>bakery</b> <b>by-product</b> and 10 to 45 % dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) during 5 dietary phases. For the overall period, pigs fed with the WD feeder had greater ADG (P < 0. 01) and ADFI (P = 0. 01) with no differences in F/G (P = 0. 50) compared with pigs fed using the CD feeder.

40|$|The use of protein-rich {{by-products}} {{based in}} swine manure (SM), poultry waste (PW) or chemicals compounds as urea (U), {{as well as}} energy products like molasses (M) and <b>bakery</b> <b>by-product</b> (BB), is a viable method to produce good quality silage. In addition, {{the use of a}} bacterial additive can improve the fermentation characteristics of silage. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine chemical composition, in vitro gas production (GP) and dry matter disappearance (DMd), using different sources of protein and energy in silage. The silages were made using SM, PW or U as protein sources and M or BB as energy source, with corn stover and with or without a bacterial additive. The organic matter (OM) content was higher (p < 0. 001) in silages with UBB, UM and SMBB compared with the rest of the treatments; meanwhile crude protein content was higher (p < 0. 001) in silages with U. The addition of a bacterial additive increased (p < 0. 05) OM content and decreased (p < 0. 05) fiber content. Total GP was higher (p < 0. 05) in silages containing BB, but DMd was higher (p < 0. 05) in silages with U and SMBB. The inclusion of a bacterial additive decreased (p < 0. 05) GP and DMd. The use of alternative sources of protein such as poultry and swine manure or urea, and of by-products of sugar industry and bakery is an alternative for silages based on corn stover. The results show that when properly formulated, the silages can provide more than 16 % of crude protein and have DMd values above 60 %...|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies were}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects}} of feeder adjustment on growth performance of growing and finishing pigs. Both experiments were conducted at a commercial swine research facility in southwest Minnesota. In Exp. 1, a total of 1, 170 barrows and gilts (PIC, initially 129. 0 lb) were used in a 70 -d study. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 5 treatments with 9 replications per treatment. The treatments were feeder settings of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, based on settings at the top of the STACO stainless steel dry feeders. Pigs were fed corn-soybean meal-based diets. From d 0 to 28, pigs fed from feeders with increasing feeder openings had increased (linear, P 0. 10) any growth performance traits. Overall (d 0 to 70), pigs fed from feeders with increasing feeder openings had increased (linear, P 0. 18) ADG or F/G. In Exp. 2, a total of 1, 250 barrows and gilts (PIC, initially 77. 3 lb) were used in a 69 -d study to determine the effect of feeder setting and diet type on growth performance of growing and finishing pigs. Pigs were blocked by weight and randomly allotted to 1 of 6 treatments with 8 replications per treatment. The treatments were arranged in a 3 × 2 factorial with main effects of STACO stainless steel dry feeder setting (1, 3, or 5) and diet type (corn-soybean meal- or by-product-based (15 % DDGS and 5 % <b>bakery</b> <b>by-product).</b> Overall (d 0 to 69), there were no feeder setting × diet type interactions (P > 0. 31) for growth performance. Diet type did not affect (P > 0. 75) growth performance. Increasing feeder openings increased ADG (qu-adratic, P 0. 08) F/G with the best F/G at feeder set-ting of 3. In conclusion, feeding pigs from feeders with a more open feeder setting increased ADG and ADFI and tended to improve F/G at middle feeder settings compared with more closed feeder settings.

40|$|A {{total of}} 757 pigs (PIC 337 × 1050, {{initially}} 60. 8 lb) {{were used to}} determine the effects of added Cu (TBCC, tribasic copper chloride, IntelliBond C; Micronutrients, Inc., Indianapolis, IN) and diet type on growth performance, carcass characteristics, energy digestibility, gut morphology, and mucosal mRNA expression of finishing pigs. Pens of pigs were allotted to 1 of 4 dietary treatments, balanced on average pen weight in a randomized complete-block design with 26 to 28 pigs per pen and 7 replications per treatment. Treatments were arranged as a 2 × 2 factorial with main effects of diet type, a corn-soybean meal-based diet or a high by-product diet with 30 % distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and 15 % <b>bakery</b> meal (<b>by-product),</b> and with or without added Cu (0 or 150 ppm added Cu). There were no Cu × diet type interactions for growth performance. Overall, neither added Cu nor diet type influenced growth performance. Pigs fed the by-product diet had decreased carcass yield (P = 0. 007) and HCW F/G (P = 0. 013), and tended to have decreased HCW (P = 0. 067) and HCW ADG (P = 0. 056) compared to pigs fed the corn-soybean meal-based diet. A Cu × diet type interaction (P < 0. 05) existed for DM and GE digestibility during the early finishing period as added Cu improved digestibility of DM and GE in the corn-soybean mealbased diet, but not in the by-product diet. During the late finishing period, added Cu increased DM and GE digestibility (P = 0. 060), while pigs fed the by-product diet had decreased DM and GE digestibility (P = 0. 001). For gut morphology, pigs fed added Cu had decreased crypt depth (P = 0. 017) in the distal small intestine. Relative mRNA expression of intestinal fatty acid binding protein (iFABP) was decreased (P = 0. 032) in pigs fed added Cu. In summary, adding 150 ppm added Cu or including 30 % DDGS and 15 % bakery meal into a corn-soybean meal-based diet did not influence growth performance. However, HCW ADG and HCW G/F were reduced in pigs fed the by-product diet. Only minor differences in gut morphology or mRNA expression were observed from pigs fed diets with high levels of Cu or by-products compared to those fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet...|$|R
40|$|Nitrogen and {{phosphorus}} from animal waste and agricultural by-products can profoundly impact water and soil quality. Diet formulation on a digestible amino acid basis reduces nitrogen excretion. Formulation on a digestible amino acid basis requires reliable estimates of amino acid digestibility. Apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids in corn, pearl millet, oat groats, sorghum, and soybean meal {{was measured in}} barrows using the difference method of diet formulation. The {{results indicate that the}} difference method of diet formulation represents a viable application for assessing amino acid digestibility of feedstuffs in pigs. True digestibility of amino acids in corn, soybean meal, and wheat <b>by-products</b> (<b>bakery</b> meal, red dog, wheat middlings) used in duck diet formulation was assessed. Cecectomized and intact ducks were subjected to precision feeding and collection methodologies to evaluate the influence of hindgut microflora on nutrient digestibility. The results suggest that variation in amino acid digestibility between cecectomized and intact ducks is considerable for low-protein ingredients, but differences in digestibility are less pronounced with higher amino acid intakes. Similar precision feeding and collection methodologies were employed to characterize the metabolizable energy (ME) of several cereal grains (corn, barley, pearl millet, sorghum, triticale). The study demonstrated the potential utility of pearl millet and sorghum in feed formulation for ducks based on comparable ME to corn. Some agricultural wastes are characterized by high nitrogen {{and phosphorus}} contents. Swine and duck nutrient balance assays were employed to evaluate co-products from a pork processing plant and a commercial microbial fermentation unit. The fermentation co-product was observed to have no feeding value due to poor ability to support nitrogen retention in pigs and ducks. Antinutritional compounds restrict the use of certain ingredients in diet formulation by exerting negative effects on nutrient availability. The effect of new xylanase and phytase preparations on performance of young pigs was investigated. Xylanase in a corn-soybean meal diet failed to influence pig performance, but improvements in growth and feed efficiency were effected by phytase addition to diets. In conclusion, incorporation of nutrient digestibility and exogenous enzyme research findings in commercial diet formulation will aid efforts to reduce the negative environmental impact of animal production. ...|$|R
