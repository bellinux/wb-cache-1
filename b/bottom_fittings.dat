5000|$|On some boats {{there are}} split pins/split rings through the pintail to stop {{gudgeons}} lifting. [...] In addition while the <b>bottom</b> <b>fitting</b> is a gudgeon turning on a pintail the upper two fittings are {{a pair of}} gudgeons each with a pin joining them with split pin/washer to stop them coming out.|$|R

These fittings are [...]25 in pipe thread, and can include an adapter from the factory for threaded steel lines in a SAE size. 4L60Es manufactured after 1995 use snap-in connections instead of threaded.|$|R

50|$|In {{the front}} and back views of a Bourdon gauge on the right, applied {{pressure}} at the <b>bottom</b> <b>fitting</b> reduces the curl on the flattened pipe proportionally to pressure. This moves the free end of the tube which is linked to the pointer. The instrument would be calibrated against a manometer, which would be the calibration standard. For measurement of indirect quantities of pressure per unit area, the calibration uncertainty would be dependent on the density of the manometer fluid, and the means of measuring the height difference. From this other units such as pounds per square inch could be inferred and marked on the scale.|$|R
50|$|Swap bodies {{normally}} {{have the same}} external dimensions for the <b>bottom</b> corner <b>fittings</b> as ISO shipping containers, {{so that they can}} be placed on the same kinds of trucks, trailers and railroad cars designed for shipping containers. However, to optimize the carriage of pallets, wide bodies are often scaled to the maximum width allowed for standard road trucks and railroad cars and to a different length accommodating a quantity of European-pool pallets (0.8 x 1.2 m) without leaving empty space.|$|R
25|$|Each {{player has}} 16 spatula-shaped pieces with a <b>bottom</b> end <b>fitting</b> into the holes of the board. One player has pieces that are rather wide and thin; {{whereas the other}} player's pieces are more obelisk-shaped. At the {{beginning}} of the game, player A's pieces are placed in the holes of row A so that the spatulas are perpendicular to the row (un-dalled), and equivalently for player B. Later in the game, the pieces will be turned (fordallede, or dalled) so that the spatula is parallel to the rows.|$|R

Some of the improvements incorporated into this apparatus include an all-glass growth vessel with a self-cleaning <b>bottom,</b> special compression <b>fittings</b> to connect tubing to glass tubing, a removable yield reservoir, and a nonwetting gas exhaust assembly. All portions of the system can be autoclaved for sterilization, and medium bottles and pump lines are replaced aseptically...|$|R
40|$|An {{extension}} of the theoretical work of Lamb and Pekeris shows that a prominent phase (Airy phase) consisting {{of a group of}} waves of period 9 - 11 seconds, traveling across the ocean with a velocity of approximately 0. 7 of the speed of sound in water, should be present on the seismograms of shallow-focus submarine earthquakes. This arrival corresponds to normal mode propagation at a stationary value of group velocity through the acoustic system consisting of the ocean and the rigid ocean <b>bottom.</b> A phase <b>fitting</b> this description has been observed on the Milne-Shaw instruments at Bermuda for a series of Dominican Republic shocks. The Wenner seismographs at Huancayo recorded the Airy phase of a shock southwest of the Galapagos Islands. The study of the Airy phase of a sufficient number of sea quakes would provide information concerning the nature of the ocean bottom since the latter affects both the periods and velocities of the Airy phase...|$|R
5|$|The tip of {{the upper}} jaw is beak-like and {{separated}} from {{the remainder of the}} jaw by a notch. There is a single row of teeth in the lower jaw and a double row in the upper, with the <b>bottom</b> row <b>fitting</b> perfectly between the two upper rows when the mouth is closed. This specific tooth arrangement is not seen in any other reptile; although most snakes have a double row of teeth in their upper jaws, their arrangement and function is different from the tuatara's. The jaws, joined by ligament, chew with backwards and forwards movements combined with a shearing up and down action. The force of the bite is suitable for shearing chitin and bone. Fossils indicate that this jaw structure began developing about 180 million years ago. The tuatara's teeth are not replaced, since they are not separate structures like real teeth, but sharp projections of the jaw bone. As their teeth wear down, older tuatara have to switch to softer prey such as earthworms, larvae, and slugs, and eventually have to chew their food between smooth jaw bones. The brain of Sphenodon fills only half of the volume of its endocranium. This proportion has actually been used by paleontologists trying to estimate the volume of dinosaur brains based on fossils. However, the proportion of the tuatara endocranium occupied by its brain may not be a very good guide to the same proportion in Mesozoic dinosaurs since modern birds are surviving dinosaurs but have brains which occupy a much greater relative volume within the endocranium.|$|R
40|$|This project {{presents}} {{the study of}} electric field stress along {{the surface of a}} 132 kV ceramic post insulator. Insulators are among the important devices of the electric power transmission systems. They are used to support and separate conductors at high voltage. Different insulator shapes have been obtained by varying several parameters, which defines the shape of the post insulator. For each insulator shape, the maximum electric field stress occurring on the insulator surface has been determined under clean and dry environment. The COMSOL Multiphysics software has been employed to investigate the electric field stress along the insulator’s surface. The full detailed model of a dry and clean ceramic 132 kV post insulator with 25 sheds has been developed for the base model calculation. The maximum value of electric field stress was found to be at the junction between the porcelain and the end fitting. End fittings with round edges tend to reduce the electric field stress along the insulator’s surface. With smaller first shed’s outer corner radius, the electric field stress slightly decreases. The electric field stress of the 25 th shed near the top end fitting tends to reduce as the shed’s inclination angle is increased. Furthermore, as the shed’s diameter increases, the electric field stress increases except at the shed’s outer corner where the electric field stress decreases. With greater distance between the first shed and the <b>bottom</b> end <b>fitting,</b> the electric field stress becomes lower. The end fittings design was found to be significantly affecting the electric field stress along the surface of the post insulator. A modified post insulator is proposed and proven to have a better performance in term of electric field stress...|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{portion of}} the cross, which is now mounted on a much later stand, is 15.75 inches high and 11.81 inches wide, excluding the spike at the <b>bottom</b> for <b>fitting</b> into its stand. The cross was restored in 2009; it has been altered and restored at several points in its history, including reducing its size. [...] The front of the cross has no figurative images: in the centre is a medallion containing the relic, which is itself displayed as cross-shaped. The centres of the arms carry the inscriptions, and {{the edges of the}} arms jewels in set in gold, with four jewels hanging from the arms as pendilia. The reverse side is decorated in repoussé silver, and shows an interesting transitional stage in the decoration of the cross. At the period the church was starting to encourage representation of the human figure of Christ on the cross, making a crucifix, which had previously not been usual. The central medallion shows the Lamb of God, a common older formula. Above and below this are images in medallions of Christ (the lower one may be John the Baptist instead). The upper one shows Christ holding a book, representing the Gospels, which was to become a standard feature of the image of Christ Pantocrator; in the lower one Christ or John has a blessing gesture. At the ends of the arms, where the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist would often be found in later crucifixes, are instead portraits in medallions of Justin and his empress Sophia. [...] Between the medallions there are decorative foliage scrolling motifs, on the upright centred on onion-like plants probably intended as palm-trees.|$|R
