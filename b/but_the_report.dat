5|$|A study {{published}} by Mulungushi University indicated that age distortions {{were found in}} census data and a tendency of age heaping with terminal digits of ‘0’ and ‘5’ were common. It also reported that gender differences existed in age reporting in Zambia with more number of males reporting their ages wrongly. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> acknowledged the difficulties in data collection and stated {{that the quality of}} data collection was better than the previous census enumerations. Another {{study published}} in the US National Library of Medicine National Institutes of Health journal indicated that the census reported very high adult female mortality, particularly a high pregnancy-related mortality in both rural and urban areas twelve months prior to the census. The evaluation of population age, age-at-death, live births were reported to contain data errors. Another study by Demographic Research indicated that the data of people aged above 80 was not accurately captured in most sub-Saharan countries, which prevented research on age-related health ailments and other socio-economic characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Curing {{the leaks}} and {{cleaning}} up the contamination delayed the tunnel's completion by a year, and it was finally opened on 22 August 1999. The entire process was further complicated by conflicts between NSB Gardermobanen and the Scandinavian Rock Group. Retrospective surveys showed a lack of control and reporting procedures during the incidents, which should have been addressed in 1995, but were never taken seriously. Compensation was paid for approximately 60 houses which were damaged {{as a result of}} tunnel construction. An evaluation by the Ministry of Transport and Communications showed that NOK500 million was spent fixing the leaks, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> claimed that this was to a large extent a waste of money, resulting from inefficient engineering procedures. The same report criticized the planning and organization of the construction of the entire railway. In total the extraordinary additional costs for the tunnel totaled NOK1.3 billion.|$|E
5|$|Usually {{reports were}} issued on any {{incident}} with every aircraft. On the date McCudden died, 29 such returns exist for S.E.5s <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> pertaining to his accident is {{not among them}} leaving the official cause of the crash unexplained. It is possible the engine failed due to a wrongly installed carburettor. However, there is some doubt as to whether a mechanical defect was the culprit. The witnesses reported the pilot was attempting low-level stunts, manifesting in several turns and rolls. Many years later other witnesses disputed the aircraft performed a roll, but all agreed the trouble began when the machine entered an attitude resembling a near-vertical turn.|$|E

25|$|The {{commission}} {{determined that}} {{the primary cause of}} the aircraft's loss was that fire detection and suppression facilities in class B cargo bays (the type used aboard the 747-200 Combi) were inadequate.

25|$|Lanrezac warned on 31 July (just before mobilisation) {{that the}} Germans might come further west through Belgium, {{although}} he still thought Sedan their likely objective. His report of July 1914 warned {{that he had}} too few troops to advance into Belgium as planned, and cited a German wargame of 1911 which called for three German armies to march through Belgium. Lanrezac later claimed that Joffre {{paid no attention to}} his report, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> did not in fact reach Joffre until 1 August, and Joffre later wrote {{that it would have been}} “premature” to discuss things with Lanrezac while the strategic situation was still unfolding.

25|$|Around midnight, a Focke Wulf Fw 200 Condor ventured too far inland and {{was shot}} down by ground defences near Hartlepool and another was lost over Northern Ireland. German records show the losses on {{different}} dates but British sources are clear that both losses occurred this night, while minelaying. Both machines came from Kampfgeschwader 40 (KG 40). At dawn (05:21), 12 Hurricanes from 54 Squadron were scrambled to engage a 40 German aircraft approaching the Thames Estuary. The Luftwaffe group had been ordered to the estuary after a convoy had been sighted <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> was mistaken. The German formation split into smaller groups, searching for the ships and British radar tracked the raiders but Hurricanes from 54 Squadron failed to intercept. Aircraft of 56 Squadron took off at 05:45, intercepted a formation of Ju88s from Kampfgeschwader 4 (KG 4), and forced one down near St Osyth.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, the Home Office {{issued a}} report on {{research}} examining the level {{and nature of the}} use of khat by Somalis in four English cities; Birmingham, Bristol, London and Sheffield. It found that 38 per cent of the respondents had ever used khat in their lifetime, with 58 per cent of men and only 16 per cent of women reporting having ever used it. 34 per cent of the overall sample indicated that they had chewed khat the month before, with 51 per cent all men in the study and 14 per cent of the women having done so. Some reported family tensions arising from their khat use. 49 per cent of those surveyed were in favour of banning khat, with 35 opposed, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> suggested that this would not be effective. Three quarters of participants who had used khat reported having suffered health effects, although these were mostly mild in nature, with the most common symptoms respondents associated with khat use being sleeping difficulties, loss of appetite, and an urge to chew more khat. The study concluded that most of the participants who were using khat were using it moderately in terms of both the quantity used and the frequency and duration of chewing sessions, and that khat use was typically a social activity. Only a small minority of the study participants' khat use was judged to be excessive. In January 2013, the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs also again cited insufficient evidence that the plant caused serious health or societal problems to warrant governmental control.|$|E

50|$|In accounting, {{the cost}} {{principle}} {{is part of}} the generally accepted accounting principles.

500|$|According to {{a report}} titled Wolves in Sheep's Clothing, which {{documents}} the increase in potentially violent, profane, and sexual content in children's programming, the Parents Television Council, a watchdog media group, and fans believed the SpongeBob SquarePants episode [...] "Sailor Mouth" [...] was an implicit attempt to promote and satirize use of profanity among children. The episode originally aired during the 2001–02 television season, ironically the season in which the PTC named SpongeBob SquarePants among the best programs on cable television, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> cited a repeat broadcast of the episode from 2005 to prove its point that it promoted use of profanity among children.

Nickelodeon, in response to the incident, said [...] "It's sad and a little desperate that they stooped to literally putting profane language in the mouths of our characters to make a point.

[...] Richard Huff of the New York Daily News criticized the report for misinterpreting an episode of SpongeBob SquarePants, [...] "Sailor Mouth", over its intent to satirize profanity implicitly.|$|E

No other details were given <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>report</b> provides real evidence to support the view that [...] "great matches" [...] played for high stakes were in vogue in the years following the Restoration. Given the Sussex venue, Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond may have been one of the patrons involved. Following the decision of the English government in 1695 to allow freedom of the press (i.e., they decided not to renew the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which had inhibited the scope of publications), it was possible for sporting events to be reported; however, it was a long time before editors gave sport any priority so coverage remained low key and infrequent for several decades.
