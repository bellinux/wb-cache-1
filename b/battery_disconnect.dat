40|$|Abstract- Accurate {{estimation}} {{of state of}} the charge (SOC) is vital for electric vehicle batteries. This paper presents a novel method to estimate the SOC based on a neural network which can be programed into a low cost microcontroller. The microcontroller monitors the battery voltage and takes four samples immediately after the <b>battery</b> is <b>disconnected</b> from the load and monitors the steady state terminal voltage when the vehicle is parked for more than 30 minutes to train a neural network. Each time the <b>battery</b> is <b>disconnected</b> from the load while driving, the microcontroller takes four voltage samples to estimate the SOC using the previously trained neural network. In order to increase the accuracy, the battery temperature is also taken as an input...|$|R

5000|$|Rarely, {{more extreme}} cases of voltage {{fluctuation}} can {{occur when the}} car <b>battery</b> is <b>disconnected</b> while the engine is running, or when the car receives a jump start. When the <b>battery</b> is <b>disconnected</b> while the engine is running, a load dump transient can produce very high voltages as the built in voltage regulator has been controlling the alternator field current to charge the vehicle battery and although it will attempt to reduce the field current to keep the output voltage constant, the field winding is highly inductive and setting the current to its new value takes several hundred milliseconds, during which the alternator output voltage will exceed its intended value. The load dump transient may also ruin the diodes in the alternator by exceeding their breakdown voltage. A car receiving a jump start from a truck {{may be subject to}} a 24 V electrical system used in some vehicles. Also, a [...] "double battery jump-start" [...] is performed by some tow truck drivers in cold climates.|$|R
5|$|The {{calculator}} was {{powered by}} a Texas Instruments TMC1802NC, a metal oxide semiconductor integrated circuit with 7000 transistors. This CPU normally consumes 350 milliwatts, but by pulsing the power this requirement was reduced to 20 milliwatts. It was discovered that an early prototype continued to work if the <b>batteries</b> were <b>disconnected</b> and then reapplied quickly enough, as the capacitors in the circuit could hold a charge {{for up to five}} seconds.|$|R

50|$|The {{windings}} of an alternator {{have a large}} inductance. When {{the vehicle}} battery is being charged, the alternator supplies it with a large current, the magnitude of which {{is controlled by the}} current in the field winding. If the <b>battery</b> becomes <b>disconnected</b> while it is being charged the alternator load suddenly decreases. However the alternator's regulator cannot quickly cause the field current to decrease sufficiently, so the alternator continues to generate a large current. This large current causes the voltage on the vehicle bus to increase significantly -- well above the normal and regulated level.|$|R
50|$|The {{morning of}} 21 December brought new fires. Twice, at 07:00 and at 11:00, eruptions forced {{the crew to}} the bridge. But the same flares {{apparently}} contributed to the fire's burning itself out. After the second, the forward battery was sufficiently discharged and the cables sufficiently ruptured to prevent further fire in the control room. Smoke from the forward battery compartment, however, {{continued to be a}} problem until she entered Kuluk Bay and the <b>battery</b> was <b>disconnected.</b> Arriving at noon on 24 December, the boat was ventilated; medical help was obtained; four men were hospitalized; and mattresses, bedding, and clothing were dried.|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{identify}} {{which type of}} smoke alarm {{is most likely to}} remain working in local authority inner city housing, and to identify an alarm tolerated in households with smokers. Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting Two local authority housing estates in inner London. Participants 2145 households. Intervention Installation of one of five types of smoke alarm (ionisation sensor with a zinc battery; ionisation sensor with a zinc battery and pause button; ionisation sensor with a lithium battery and pause button; optical sensor with a lithium battery; or optical sensor with a zinc battery). Main outcome measure Percentage of homes with any working alarm and percentage in which the alarm installed for this study was working after 15 months. Results 54. 4 % (1166 / 2145) of all households and 45. 9 % (465 / 1012) of households occupied by smokers had a working smoke alarm. Ionisation sensor, lithium battery, and there being a smoker in the household were independently associated with whether an alarm was working (adjusted odds ratios 2. 24 (95 % confidence interval 1. 75 to 2. 87), 2. 20 (1. 77 to 2. 75), and 0. 62 (0. 52 to 0. 74)). The most common reasons for non-function were missing battery (19 %), missing alarm (17 %), and <b>battery</b> <b>disconnected</b> (4 %). Conclusions Nearly half of the alarms installed were not working when tested 15 months later. Type of alarm and power source are important determinants of whether a household had a working alarm...|$|R
50|$|Batteries {{also have}} {{a small amount of}} {{internal}} resistance that will discharge the battery even when it is <b>disconnected.</b> If a <b>battery</b> is left <b>disconnected,</b> any internal charge will drain away slowly and eventually reach the critical point. From then on the film will develop and thicken. This is the reason batteries will be found to charge poorly or not at all if left in storage {{for a long period of}} time.|$|R
5000|$|Conventional {{lead-acid}} batteries {{consist of}} a number of plates of lead and lead dioxide suspended in a cell filled with weak sulfuric acid. Lead oxide reacts with the sulfur and oxygen in the acid to give up an electron, leaving the plate positively charged and producing lead sulfate. Lead reacts with the acid by taking in two electrons, leaving it negative while also producing lead sulfate. The two chemical processes continue as long as an external circuit is available to allow the electrons to flow back into the positive plates, but reaches equilibrium quickly when the <b>battery</b> is <b>disconnected</b> from the circuit. Each complete reaction produces about 2.11V. A typical 12V battery consists of six individual [...] "cells" [...] wired together in a single box, producing 13.2V when fully charged.|$|R
40|$|This project {{uses the}} BP SX 150 S solar panel to charge a 12 V battery. This battery powers an AIMS 400 W Modified Sine Wave Inverter to provide 120 V RMS AC {{power to a}} load of up to 40 W. Inverter {{efficiency}} was measured at different load conditions. A control circuit was implemented to prevent overcharging or over-discharging of the <b>battery,</b> by <b>disconnecting</b> it from the panel or the load, respectively. The control circuit turn-on and cutoff voltages were measured versus battery voltage, and the on-resistance of the MOSFET switches was measured for various load currents. A table of panel inclinations was calculated for different times of year, and these calculations were verified experimentally. The battery voltage was measured with respect to state of charge, and this data was plotted against the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s stated performance. Finally, the battery round trip efficiency was calculated to ensure it was within {{the requirements of the}} design...|$|R
50|$|Telecommunications, {{electric}} power, {{and computer}} {{uninterruptible power supply}} facilities may have very large standby battery banks (installed in battery rooms) to maintain critical loads for several hours during interruptions of primary grid power. Such chargers are permanently installed and equipped with temperature compensation, supervisory alarms for various system faults, and often redundant independent power supplies and redundant rectifier systems. Chargers for stationary battery plants may have adequate voltage regulation and filtration and sufficient current capacity to allow the <b>battery</b> to be <b>disconnected</b> for maintenance, while the charger supplies the DC system load. Capacity of the charger is specified to maintain the system load and recharge a completely discharged battery within, say, 8 hours or other interval.|$|R
40|$|Discuss {{the time}} {{evolution}} of {{various forms of}} energy a series RLC circuit that is energized at time t = 0 by a battery of voltage V. Include consideration of radiated energy, supposing that the circuit has {{the form of a}} circular loop of radius a. This problem relates {{to the question of whether}} a capacitor can be charged without loss of energy. As confirmed in sec. 2. 1, if the capacitor is charged to voltage V in a simple RC circuit, then the resistor dissipates energy equal to that eventually stored in the capacitor. Heinrich [1] noted that this energy loss could be avoided if the battery is replaced by a variable power supply whose voltage is raised “slowly ” to the desired value V. 1 See also [2, 3]. If one capacitor is charged by another in a circuit with negligible resistance, there is again a loss of energy, to radiation in this case [4, 5, 6]. These analyses leave open the question of whether energy loss is inevitable whenever a capacitor is charged “quickly”. Show that a capacitor can be charged with only modest energy loss in an underdamped series RLC circuit if the <b>battery</b> is <b>disconnected</b> after 1 / 2 cycle. ...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} an {{efficient}} aggregate signcryption scheme {{to maximize the}} security of data {{in a kind of}} wireless medical network named the disconnected or unattended wireless sensor network (applied in medical systems). These networks address patients who need to be monitored for a long time. The main challenge of these networks that are usually implanted on the patient’s clothing and established in sensitive conditions is that the server (station) visits sensors continuously. Moreover, the sensors must retain data for long enough time to off-load to the station as they have limited capacity and <b>batteries.</b> This <b>disconnected</b> nature gives adversaries the power to read and modify target data without being detected or disclose private medical data related to a patient. In this paper, we address these security problems and improve the first study of identity-based aggregate signcryption in UWSNs to achieve both key privacy and invisibility. Our improved approach {{is at the same time}} efficient in terms of space and communication overload. Moreover, the proposed scheme allows servers to efficiently verify and unsigncrypt all the related data accumulated by sensors. We further show that the proposed scheme has resistance against reading and modifying attacks. We compare our scheme with the best alternative works in the literature...|$|R
50|$|In {{the final}} version of the GWR system, the {{locomotives}} were fitted with a solenoid-operated valve into the vacuum train pipe, maintained in the closed position by a battery. At each distant signal, a long ramp was placed between the rails. This ramp consisted of a straight metal blade set edge-on, almost parallel to the direction of travel (the blade was slightly offset from parallel so in its fixed position it would not wear a groove into the locomotives' contact shoes), mounted on a wooden support. As the locomotive passed over the ramp, a sprung contact shoe beneath the locomotive was lifted and the battery current holding closed the brake valve was broken. In the case of a clear signal, current from a battery energising the ramp (but at opposite polarity) passed to the locomotive through the contact and maintained the brake valve in the closed position, with the reversed-polarity current ringing a bell in the cab. When the signal was at 'danger', the ramp <b>battery</b> was <b>disconnected</b> and so could not replace the locomotive's battery current: the brake valve solenoid would then be released and a horn sounded in the cab. The driver was then expected to cancel the warning and apply the brakes under his own control.|$|R
5000|$|The French {{scientist}} Gautherot {{observed in}} 1801 that wires {{that had been}} used for electrolysis experiments would themselves provide a small amount of [...] "secondary" [...] current after the main <b>battery</b> had been <b>disconnected.</b> [...] In 1859, Gaston Planté's lead-acid battery was the first battery that could be recharged by passing a reverse current through it. Planté's first model consisted of two lead sheets separated by rubber strips and rolled into a spiral. His batteries were first used to power the lights in train carriages while stopped at a station. In 1881, Camille Alphonse Faure invented an improved version that consisted of a lead grid lattice, into which a lead oxide paste was pressed, forming a plate. This design was easier to mass-produce. An early manufacturer (from 1886) of lead-acid batteries was Henri Tudor.|$|R

40|$|A large {{microgrid}} {{project is}} nearing completion at Alameda County’s twenty-two-year-old 45 ha 4, 000 -inmate Santa Rita Jail, about 70 km east of San Francisco. Often {{described as a}} green prison, it has a considerable installed base of distributed energy resources (DER) including an eight-year old 1. 2 MW PV array, a five-year old 1 MW fuel cell with heat recovery, and considerable efficiency investments. A current US$ 14 M expansion adds a 2 MW- 4 MWh Li-ion <b>battery,</b> a static <b>disconnect</b> switch, and various controls upgrades. During grid blackouts, or when conditions favor it, the Jail can now disconnect from the grid and operate as an island, using the on-site resources described together with its back-up diesel generators. In other words, the Santa Rita Jail is a true microgrid, or μgrid, because it fills both requirements, i. e. it is a locally controlled system, and it can operate both grid connected and islanded. The battery’s electronics includes Consortium for Electric Reliability Technology (CERTS) Microgrid technology. This enables the battery to maintain energy balance using droops without need for a fast control system...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} years, three main {{approaches}} to transmit power without cable connections have been studied. The first one relies on microwave radiating systems, and its performance is mostly {{limited by the}} rectenna device, required to pick-up and DC convert the radiated power. This approach has not pervaded application fields since its hazardousness is still not well assessed. Moreover, it has still to face several technological issues and safety concerns before being eligible for application. The second one refers to optical wireless transmission at long distances, which uses laser and photovoltaic diodes for successful operation. The third approach exploits coupled circuits to transmit power upon short or midrange distances. Its breakthrough is gaining attention {{in a number of}} application fields, such as radiofrequency identification, small batteryless home appliances, mobile devices and electrical vehicles recharging, wireless and body sensor networks. The paper deals with wireless power transmission technology based on the third approach, and takes into account two classes of applications: contactless recharging and batteryless supply. Contactless recharging involves the possibility of keeping an electrical equipment, and specifically its internal <b>battery,</b> grid <b>disconnected,</b> without giving up to its recharging. Batteryless supply permits the functioning of remote wireless equipment, often deployed in networked architectures, which are more and more valued for their fast installation and easy re-positioning features. For both classes, the benefits that can be achieved by adopting wireless power transmission are also highlighted. An experimental study is finally carried out. To this end, a typical architecture of a power transmission system relying on resonance-based coupling mechanisms is implemented. The ground electronics of the simple set-up, which uses a relaxation oscillator in the primary circuit and a full-rectifier bridge in the secondary to attain DC power, is described in detail. The obtained results show the efficiency of the power transfer mechanism both for nominal operative conditions and different ones characterized by deliberate mismatches...|$|R
40|$|The article {{analyzes}} the methods affecting autonomous operation regimes of the powergrid sections with distributed electric-power sources (distributed generation) whose {{connection to the}} electric-power grid is realized by means of special distributed generation inverters. The authors evidentiate the reasons for which autonomous operation is undesirable; examine consequences of the autonomous asynchronous operation of the grid-sections during islanding. These problems are innate for the modern Smart Grid networks. Islanding detection methods include passive and active ones. The passive methods rely only on observation of the voltage and/or frequency {{at the point of}} common coupling (PCC) disconnecting the inverter if the  measured  values  are  outside  the  specified  limits.  Despite  their  simplicity,  passive methods cannot assure reliable islanding detection, especially in the cases when distributed generation power equals the power of loads in the potential grid-island. The active methods assume the inverter affecting the grid with the view of detecting deviation from the standard regime parameters in the PCC. Although these methods have much better islanding detection ability, their utilization reduces the power-grid operation quality. The paper holds that the grid-sections autonomous regime detection without virtually no failure-to-detect zone is only possible with employment of effective anti-islanding schemes such as connecting capacitor <b>batteries</b> to the <b>disconnected</b> power-grid sector. If appropriate providing enhanced survivability and continuity of power supply, the authors recommend providing islanding detection lock option in the inverters of the distributed generation sources. </p...|$|R
40|$|Global Positioning System (GPS) based vehicle {{tracking}} over General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) had been {{widely used in}} many places. This system {{was a combination of}} GPS in a vehicle to indicate its position on the geographic coordinate and a GPRS to send the data of position and other important data into a computer connected via the Internet. General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) is a data service part of a Global System for Mobile Communications GSM cellular phone with speed from 56 kilobit per second (kbps) up to 114 kbps. Coordinate data obtained from the GPS receiver onboard the vehicle was processed fully inside the receiver unit and the output of the unit was serial data communication using TTL logic level using NMEA 0183 protocol which was connected to the first serial port of a microcontroller. Before the coordinate system of the GPS passed to the GPRS unit, the microcontroller also checked the other conditions such as emergency button, power supply, internal battery and speed of vehicle. The unit had internal Lithium battery to selfsufficient its power consumption up to 10 hours. The battery could be recharged automatically from the vehicle battery with its own power management module. The lithium battery was important when the vehicle was stolen and the main <b>battery</b> was <b>disconnected</b> from the vehicle, the system could still track the vehicle. This unit was also equipped with vehicle security alert system in which when there were security breaches, the driver of the vehicle could push a hidden button and the operator would notice it almost immediately via the web page. The command for the GPRS modem and the GPS receiver modules were AT+ commands. The data received by the web server was then stored in a database on the server which contain the GPS coordinate and the time data was received. The sequence of coordinate and time were displayed on a web page in an overlay on Google Map which was freely available together with markers to indicate the location of the vehicle.

40|$|The {{investment}} {{involved in}} any communication system represents a considerable sum. Even though it is desirable that the system work properly each and every time it is called into use, some failures are bound to occur. Most failures, however, and especially those that occur most frequently, are due to poor installation techniques. An extra hour spent at an installation site can save many maintenance trips and many frustrating hours of system troubleshooting. Typical faults likely to cause communication outrage are Pager phone systems Poor splices aggravated by corrosion. Strain relief not provided. Drip loop not provided. Incorrect branch connections. Overloading the circuit. Poor battery connections. Improper wire size or type. Lightning strikes. Improper placement of wire runs. Carrier phones Mounting transceiver near load resistors or other sources of heat. Tracks not electrically bonded. Cable abrasion due to poor mounting location. <b>Disconnected</b> <b>battery.</b> Poor mechanical installation. Each installation should be well planned. After an installation is completed, the technician should ask the question, "What can go wrong with this unit or line?" Remember the adage, "Whatever can go wrong, will. " Preventive measures taken during installation will pay off in the long run. 6. 2 Pager Phone Installation The pager phones used in many underground coal mines are battery-operated, party-line telephones with provisions for loudspeaker paging. The system is usually two-wire, nonpolarized, and operated by self-contained batteries. Many of the individual units are certified as permissible. 6. 2. 1 Mounting Pager phones {{are designed to be}} mounted on an upright support at the desired location. For convenience, the phone should be mounted 5 feet above the floor where there is no obstruction to using the handset or removing the cabinet front cover for servicing or battery replacement. In low-coal situations, a suitable height for installation should be selected convenient to the normal operator's position at the site selected. About 12 inches of free space {{on each side of the}} phone should be provided for cabinet access. The phone should be protected against direct exposure to dripping water and should not be allowed to rest in a puddle of water. The mounting location should be convenient to a work location and have a safe, unobstructed area for a worker to stand and use the phone. The phone must be in a location where the worker will not be in the path of moving vehicles or falling debris. Each telephone is normally well insulated, but it is still good practice to provide an insulating mat or dry planking for the user to stand on...|$|R
