40|$|Two large {{earthquakes}} {{took place}} in the south Iceland lowland in June 2000, both with magnitudes 6. 6. Serious injuries did not occur {{as a result of the}} earthquakes but several houses were severely damaged. The earthquakes {{took place in}} an area called the south Iceland seismic zone representing a transform plate boundary between the Eurasian and the North American lithospheric plates. Within this zone of high seismicity several destructive earthquakes have taken place since the settlement of Iceland in the ninth century. A long term forecast from 1985 stated high probability of a destructive earthquake sequence before 2010. There is a relationship between earthquake occurence and deformation of the earth’s crust. A study has been made of the crustal deformation in the south Iceland seismic zone between 1984 and 1995 in order to search for possible precursors for the June 2000 earthquakes. Large and anomalous strain signals were identified slightly west of the fault that ruptured the June 17 th 2000. These strains are interpreted as preseismic precursors for the earthquake that occurred the 17 th of June 2000. Regarding precursors for the June 21 st earthquake no conclusions could be drawn, due to spurious data. The deformation measured in south Iceland between 1984 and 1995 can be considered to represent the preseismic phase of the crustal deformation cycle in south Iceland. The coseismic phase of deformation in the two earthquakes is known through the work of other authors. For future work it is recommended to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>on</b> the postseismic and interseismic phases of the crustal deformation cycle through continued monitoring of crustal deformation in south Iceland. It is also recommended to keep an eye on the areas where anomalous deformation was identified in this work. These areas could be locations for future earthquakes in south Iceland.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation presents the first integrated study on patient safety in Palestinian hospitals, relating patient safety culture with {{the rate of}} adverse events. Patient safety has been recognized as an essential foundation of good patient care. This has been stimulated worldwide in the 21 st century by {{the publication of the}} Institute of Medicines To Err Is Human in 1999. The main objectives of this dissertation were to evaluate the patient safety levels in Palestinian hospitals. A secondary objective was to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>on</b> generating and understanding safety culture within hospitals and departments. The third objective was to test the relation between different aspects of patient safety culture and the prevalence of adverse events. The study consists of three phases. In the first phase, we evaluated the feasibility of using the well-established method of retrospective medical records review in a health care system with limited resources and possibly with less comprehensive medical records. Our study identified that assessment of adverse events is feasible in Palestine. To monitor incidents of adverse events, 640 medical records were reviewed retrospectively; 14 % of admitted patients suffered harm in Palestinian hospitals, 60 % of these events were preventable. These outcomes are comparable with average scores from studies in Western societies. In the second phase, the Hospital survey on Patient safety culture (AHRQ) was used to measure hospital staff perceptions on several safety aspects (staffing, communication, teamwork, hospital management, etc.). To measure safety culture based on a well-established method, we first translated and examined the psychometric evaluation of the Arabic version of HSOPSC. Then, we assessed the safety culture within Palestinian hospitals. Finally, we evaluated the patient safety culture and perceived patient safety differences in Palestinian and Belgian hospitals and how different dimensions of safety culture contribute to outcomes dimensions in a matched sample of Belgian and Palestinian hospital workers. All of these studies provided evidence that the HSOPSC/AV was a valid and reliable instrument. Moreover, it was a good international andcross cultural instrument. We were able to identify areas for promoting safety. In the last phase, we tested and found support for our core hypothesis that patient safety culture is related with adverse events rates, at hospital departments. We conclude that the assessment of adverse events and patient safety culture is feasible in Palestine. Moreover, interventios, including implementation of structural measuring patient safety, are needed to further increase patient safety. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"  <w:latentstyles=""  status: publishe...|$|E

30|$|From the {{perspective}} of a second life manufacturer, investments in relationship-specific assets are necessary. The lack of standardization among automotive OEMs, proprietary battery components, and encrypted battery data require second life manufacturers to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> OEM-specific <b>knowledge</b> <b>on</b> the repurposing of battery systems, and EVB-type-specific target designs for the repurposed battery systems need to be developed. In addition, second life manufacturers have to strongly rely on repurposing processes that are optimized for a particular automotive OEM, since the costs for repurposing batteries are a crucial factor in the competitiveness of the repurposed battery systems in comparison to new battery systems (Cready et al. 2003; Neubauer et al. 2015). A second life manufacturer’s resulting dependency on an automotive OEM bears the risk of being exploited by the OEM. Consequently, both the automotive OEM and the second life manufacturer have to protect against the opportunistic behavior of the other.|$|R
40|$|Large {{population-based}} research cohorts, {{together with}} national health registries and biobanks are core components {{in a modern}} infrastructure for knowledge. Along with the other Nordic countries, Norway has unique opportunities for high quality research based on cohorts, biobanks and registries. Cohorts, biobanks and registries {{provide a basis for}} discovering causes and mechanisms of disease as well as for following the development of disease, effects of treatment and consequences of disease. The purpose of this manuscript is to give a brief outline of a project that makes use of these unique opportunities by using data from The Norwegian Mother and Child cohort study (MoBa) to address research questions of common interest, and thus encourage other research groups to use this “happy hunting ground”. The present study, Causal Pathways for Asthma (CASPAR) funded by the Research Council of Norway, is a subproject of MoBa. The project is designed {{to take advantage of the}} potential for research on human biological material in biobanks, by coupling analysis results with data from health surveys, health registries and the health services. The present study is based on an ongoing collaboration between the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH), the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS) in the US and several other national and international collaborators within The MoBa Asthma Group. The main aim of the study is to examine a number of hypothesis regarding in utero and early life exposures in relation to the development of different phenotypes of asthma and allergies in childhood. For the majority of children who become asthmatic and allergic, the differentiation of their immune system into an atopic phenotype probably begins before birth and is established within the first six years of life. This study will advance knowledge of the mechanisms whereby diet and environmental exposures influences gene expression to alter risk of atopic disease. The prime purpose is to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> new <b>knowledge</b> <b>on</b> asthma pathogenesis. There is a great need to develop a new paradigm of disease pathogenesis that takes advantages of applied molecular approaches to asthma and atopic diseases as it occurs in humans at different stages of development. This project takes advantage not only of the basic MoBa samples and infrastructure including links to other national health registries, but also a new national supplementary study of MoBa that includes measures of prenatal exposures in maternal plasma believed to have epigenetic influences on asthma/atopy development and data on genome wide methylation of cord blood DNA. </p...|$|R
40|$|Teams {{matter in}} healthcare. In an {{increasingly}} complex, knowledge-intensive medical environment, effective interprofessional teamwork {{is an essential}} component for the delivery of high-quality patient care. Furthermore, the World Health Organization (WHO) World Alliance for Patient Safety points out that improving communication and coordination has to be priority number one for patient safety research and practice in developed countries. Nonetheless high-level evidence is lacking, one intervention that can promote teamwork in healthcare is mentioned to be the implementation of care pathways. The primary objective of this dissertation was therefore to evaluate the impact of care pathways on interprofessional teamwork in an acute hospital setting. A secondary objective is to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> <b>knowledge</b> <b>on</b> the active components of care pathways and on {{the conditions under which}} they can be most effective through evaluation of the implementation processes. The study consists of four phases. In a first phase, we identified team indicators {{that can be used to}} measure interprofessional teamwork in care processes. Based on a literature search a list of 44 team indicators was developed. Afterwards an international expert panel was set, and the Delphi consensus method was used to support the process of effective decision making in selecting team indicators. For this process a purposively selected group of experts in teamwork consisting of both scientific researchers and hospital managers was chosen. Thirty-six experts from 13 countries participated. A final list of 19 indicators was generated: 5 on team context/structure, 8 on team process, and 6 on team outcomes. Secondly, a systematic review was performed to study the impact of existing care pathways on interprofessional teamwork. We included 26 studies in this review. In total, we identified 20 team indicators that were used to study the relationship between CPs and teamwork. We found that CPs positively affected 17 of 20 indicators. However, the level of evidence found was rather low. Thirdly, A post-test-only cluster randomized controlled trial was performed in Belgian acute hospitals. Teams caring for patients hospitalized with a proximal femur fracture and patients hospitalized with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were randomized into intervention and control groups. The intervention groups implemented a CP. The control group provided usual care. A set of team input, process, and output indicators was used as effect measures. To analyze results, we performed multilevel statistical analysis. Thirty teams and a total of 581 individual team members participated. The intervention teams scored significantly better on conflict management (ß= 0. 30 (0. 11), 95 % CI 0. 08 to 0. 53); team climate for innovation (ß= 0. 29 (0. 10), 95 % CI 0. 09 to 0. 49); and level of organized care (ß= 5. 56 (2. 05), 95 % CI 1. 35 to 9. 76). They also showed lower risk of burnout as they scored significantly lower on emotional exhaustion (ß= - 0. 57 (0. 21), 95 % CI - 1. 00 to- 0. 14) and higher on level of competence (ß= 0. 39, 95 % CI 0. 15 to 0. 64). No significant effect was found on relational coordination. Fourthly, semi-structured, one-to-one interviews were performed after CP implementation with a purposive sample of key representatives of the 17 teams that were randomized in the intervention group. The Normalization Process Model (NPM) was used as theoretical framework to guide the inductive thematic analysis. Emerging themes were mapped onto the four NPM constructs. In total, we identified 21 elements that influenced the workability of CPs, and 23 elements that influenced their level of integration. The interviews also suggested that most teams were able to adopt the complex intervention and will be able to integrate the CP into daily practice. We conclude that CPs are an effective intervention for improving interprofessional teamwork and conflict management, increasing the organizational level of care processes, and decreasing risk of burnout for healthcare teams caring for COPD exacerbation and PFF patients in an acute hospital setting. Through this, they can tackle several barriers against interprofessional teamwork that are present in healthcare organizations, and create required essential job resources that can buffer the impact of the increasing job demands within todays healthcare environment. CPs can therefore be used to build high-performance teams that can be supported and guided in actively improving the quality and safety of care processes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Esta pesquisa tem como objetivo construir um conhecimento sobre a infÃncia cearense nas primeiras dÃcadas do sÃculo XX, quando circulavam nos meios educacionais novas idÃias sobre a educaÃÃo da crianÃa. Estas idÃias tiveram sua origem no movimento internacional das Escolas Novas â iniciado na Europa e nos Estados Unidos. Tal movimento propunha o rompimento com uma educaÃÃo tradicional de carÃter intelectualista, centrada na figura do professor. Defendia uma pedagogia fundamentada em conhecimentos cientÃficos sobre a crianÃa, um ensino baseado na atividade do aluno que por sua vez deveria ocupar o centro do processo educativo. Enfim, uma educaÃÃo que se apoiava numa nova concepÃÃo de infÃncia. No Brasil, esse novo ideÃrio pedagÃgico foi propagado no primeiro perÃodo republicano, apÃs ter sido aplicado em vÃrias partes do mundo. As novas atitudes em relaÃÃo Ã educaÃÃo da crianÃa foram veiculadas nacionalmente por educadores e intelectuais atravÃs de publicaÃÃes cientÃficas ou de cunho didÃtico; por meio dos programas das Escolas Normais; como tambÃm atravÃs do ciclo de reformas educacionais nos estados brasileiros e no Distrito Federal, ocorrido na dÃcada de 1920, tendo o CearÃ como um dos pioneiros na sua implantaÃÃo. Reconhecendo a importÃncia da chegada dessas idÃias e sua repercussÃo na ambiÃncia {{cultural}} cearense, nossa proposta foi tentar reconstruir o cotidiano de crianÃas que se submeteram Ã educaÃÃo formal em instituiÃÃes escolares, ou mesmo em casa, nos primeiros decÃnios do sÃculo XX. Foi nosso interesse investigar a influÃncia de idÃias escolanovistas na educaÃÃo da infÃncia naquele perÃodo. Na busca desses objetivos enveredamos pelo caminho metodolÃgico da histÃria oral. Confiamos Ã fonte da memÃria o trabalho de nos trazer do passado uma histÃria que nÃo se encontra nos livros. Para tanto, contamos com a colaboraÃÃo de sete depoentes com idade entre 84 e 102 anos que se dispuseram a relatar suas histÃrias de vida com Ãnfase na fase da infÃncia. A partir dos relatos dessas pessoas âcomunsâ, conseguimos desenhar, utilizando as cores da memÃria, a imagem de uma infÃncia cujo cenÃrio possuÃa caracterÃsticas rurais, no qual crianÃa e natureza se confundiam principalmente nos momentos de lazer. Nas narrativas ficou evidente a carÃncia de instituiÃÃes de ensino, embora fossem constantes as promessas governamentais de melhoria na educaÃÃo. Apesar disso, outras alternativas foram encontradas para a educaÃÃo das crianÃas. Nesse campo predominava uma pedagogia tradicional, embora traÃos de novidade fossem identificados nas escolas freqÃentadas pelos depoentes. Constatamos que aquelas idÃias que atravessaram mares atÃ chegar entre nÃs e movimentaram o ambiente cultural cearense, pouco repercutiram no cotidiano escolar e domÃstico de nossas crianÃas. Apesar disso acreditamos que as iniciativas decorrentes destas, nÃo foram em vÃo e sim muito importantes na definiÃÃo de uma nova infÃncia, hoje centro gravitacional de vÃrios campos da ciÃncia, como tambÃm de polÃticas educacionaisThe {{objective of}} this research is to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> some <b>knowledge</b> <b>on</b> the childhood in CearÃ during {{the first decades of the}} 20 th century, when new ideas on children education had arisen in the educational milieu. These ideas had their origin in the international movement of the New Schools â beginning in Europe and the United States. This movement proposed the rupture of the traditional education whose characteristics were the intellectualism and teacher centered education. It defended a pedagogy grounded in scientific knowledge of a child, a teaching based in the student activity, which, on its turn should occupy the center of the educational process; In brief, an education which was based on a new conception of childhood. In Brazil, this set of pedagogical ideas was proposed in the first republican period, after it had been applied in several other parts of the world. The new attitudes in relation to children education were transmitted nationally by educators and scholars through scientific or pedagogic publications; through the teacher preparatory schools, as well as through the educational reform cycles in the Brazilian schools and the Federal District, occurred in the 1920 Âs, being CearÃ one of the pioneers in its implantation. By acknowledging the importance of the arrival of these ideas and its effects in the cultural milieu of CearÃ, our proposal was to try to rebuild the children routine that undergo formal education in schools, or even at home, during the early decades of the 20 th century. It was our goal to investigate the influence of the new-school ideas in children education during that period. In the search of these objectives we set out for the methodological way of the oral history. We rely on the memory of interviewees to bring from the past a history which we can not retrieve in books. Therefore, we counted on the cooperation of seven interviewees aged 84 to 102 years old who were willing to relate the history of their lives with focus to their childhood. From the account of these ordinary people, we managed to trace back the image of a childhood whose scenery had rural characteristics, in which the child and the nature mingled, especially during leisure time. In the narratives, it is evident the lack of educational institutions, though the governmental promises for increase of vacancies in elementary schools were constant. In spite of this, other alternatives were encountered for the children education. In this field, a traditional pedagogy prevailed, even though features of newness were identified in the schools the interviewees went. We certified that those ideas that crossed oceans to reach us and bustled the cultural scene of CearÃ, had little impact in the school routine and the daily life of our children. Despite this, we believe that the actions that occurred afterward were not in vain. They were very important for the definition of a new childhood, which is today the center of interest of several fields in science, as well as educational policie...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} in this thesis is to provide deeper understanding on the geometric, electronic, and magnetic properties of gas phase clusters {{as a function of}} size and composition using a combination of the spectroscopic techniques and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The thesis is divided into four parts. A review of recent research on the structural identification of doped silicon clusters is given in Part I. In Part II, the geometric structures of transition metal (TM = Ag, Au, and Co) doped silicon clusters are investigated by infrared (IR) action spectroscopy and DFT calculations. Nonlinear effects in IR action spectroscopy are investigated by joint experimental and dedicated modeling studies in Part III. In Part IV, recent progress on the development of a magnetic deflection setup at the KU Leuven is presented. The interest in silicon clusters was triggered by the ongoing trend towards further miniaturization in microelectronics. An important discovery was the observation of unique luminescence properties in silicon nanostructures, where the emission wavelength can be tuned by changing the particle size, making them very attractive for a variety of applications. However, bare silicon clusters are not well suitable as building blocks for nanoassembled materials, as they have chemically reactive dangling bonds. A possible approach to overcome this deficiency is to add transition metal dopant atoms to the silicon clusters. Different dopant elements have different atomic structures, therefore one would expect that they will have disparate effects on the silicon clusters. In Part I, we review recent research on the structural identification of isolated doped silicon clusters by combining state-of-the-art experiments (chemical probe mass spectrometric methods, IR action spectroscopy, photoelectron spectroscopy, and x-ray absorption spectroscopy) and computational modelling using the density functional theory formalism. The growth mechanisms of the doped silicon clusters are described with particular emphasis on the formation of endohedral cages. Besides geometric structures, also electronic and magnetic properties of the clusters are commented on. In Part II, the geometric structures of cationic SinAg+ (n = 6 − 15), SinAu+ (n = 2 − 11, 14, 15), SinCo+ (n = 5 − 8) and SinCo 2 + (n = 8 − 12) clusters were investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy (IR-MPD), and those of neutral SinCo (n = 10 − 12) by infrared ultraviolet two-color ionization (IR−UV 2 CI), both in combination with DFT computations. The influence of the different coinage metal dopant atoms (Cu, Ag, and Au) on the structures of Sin+/ 0 clusters is systematically investigated. The coinage metal atoms favor adsorption on bare Sin+ clusters rather than taking substitutional positions, which is in sharp contrast with silicon clusters doped by transition metals atoms like V, Nb and Mn, where substitution is preferable. On the other hand, there are slight differences among the growth mechanisms of the different coinage metal doped Sin+ clusters, which {{can be attributed to the}} different atomic radii of the dopants, the different d occupancy of the dopant atoms, and the different charge transfer. Different from the coinage metal doped silicon cluster, small SinCo+ (n = 5 − 8) clusters have exohedral structures in which the Co atom substitutes an atom of bare Sin+ 1 + clusters, while retaining a high local magnetic moment. Large SinCo (n = 10 − 12) clusters were found to have endohedral caged structures. Electronic structure analysis indicates strong hybridization between the Co dopant atom and the silicon host, which quenches the local magnetic moment of the encapsulated Co atom. In the doubly doped SinCo 2 + clusters, the second Co atom is adsorbed to the singly doped counterparts and for n ≥ 9 one of the Co atoms is encapsulated by a silicon cage. Computational analysis of the electronic and magnetic properties of the identified isomers indicates a distance dependent magnetic coupling between the Co atoms in SinCo 2 +. For structural identification, the experimental IR spectra are normally compared to computed linear harmonic absorption spectra, although both IR-MPD and IR-UV 2 CI spectroscopy involve complex processes, such as sequential photon absorption, vibrational energy redistribution, and cluster dissociation. With the objective to obtain fundamental insight about the mechanisms of the IR action spectroscopy, the non-linear effects are investigated by joining experiment and dedicated modelling in Part III. IR spectra of neutral silicon clusters are recorded by IR−UV 2 CI and cationic vanadium oxide clusters are studied either by dissociation of O 2 or Xe messenger atoms following infrared multiple photon absorption. In the simulation, vibrational anharmonicities, laser interaction through photon absorption and stimulated emission, as well as the relevant ionization or dissociation rates, have been taken into account. Comparison of the measured and calculated spectra illustrates how non-linear effects, such as the absorption of multiple infrared photons, energy redistribution, and statistical dissociation or ionization, affect the spectroscopic features. The aim of Part IV is to further develop and characterize a recently constructed Stern-Gerlach magnetic deflection setup and to use this setup to study the magnetism of binary clusters, with the objective to <b>build</b> <b>up</b> fundamental <b>knowledge</b> <b>on</b> the magnetic interactions between the different types of atoms and on the interplay of geometric structure and magnetism. The Stern-Gerlach magnetic deﬂection system consists of a cryogenic laser vaporization cluster source, a beam chopper, a dual-stage collimator system, a Stern-Gerlach magnet, a drift tube, a reflectron time-of-flight mass spectrometer and a position sensitive detector. Implemented on a dual-target dual-laser vaporization source, the cryogenic system allows to control the temperature of the clusters, which influences the deflection behavior since the magnetism of clusters depends on cluster temperature. The cluster velocity is measured by the chopper wheel. Two collimators deﬁne a beam shape of 0. 3 × 3. 0 mm 2. The collimated beam is deﬂected in the magnet and has a free ﬂight before entering the extraction. A magnet with inhomogeneous magnetic field deflects clusters that have a time-averaged non-zero magnetic moment. Information on cluster size distribution and deﬂection can be measured simultaneously by the position-sensitive detector installed in the high resolution time-of-ﬂight mass spectrometer. Recent progress made with the setup is discussed in Part IV. In particular, a cryocooler is installed to cool the cluster source and tested. It is mounted to the nozzle and allows to cool it down to 20 K within 50 min. In combination with a temperature controller, it allows to vary the temperature from 20 K to room temperature. Furthermore, the Rabi-type magnet, which is used to deflect the cluster beam, is calibrated by Al and Y atoms. At last, we show the magnetic deflection measurement of small Con (n = 7 − 21) clusters. The magnetic moment of Con clusters, as derived from the deflected beam profiles, is compared with literature data. Finally the error margins on the measured magnetic moment are discussed and further improvement are proposed. status: publishe...|$|R
