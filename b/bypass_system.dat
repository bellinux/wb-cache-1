25|$|A {{man named}} Sabbath, an {{eighteenth-century}} secret agent gifted with time travel abilities, excised the blackened organ, both saving the Doctor's life and robbing the Doctor {{of some of}} his higher Time Lord abilities (his respiratory <b>bypass</b> <b>system</b> and his ability to metabolise toxins). It transpired that Sabbath was actually after the heart for his own purposes: when implanted into Sabbath's own chest, it imparted upon him those same Time Lord powers. An unexpected side effect of this experiment was that so long as the Doctor's heart remained within Sabbath's chest, the Doctor himself remained practically invulnerable to harm (though any injury sustained by the Doctor would weaken Sabbath).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Bypass</b> {{pneumatic}} conveying <b>systems</b> provide a passive capability to reduce conveying velocity and therefore reduce attrition and abrasion {{in the process}} of conveying many fragile and erosive particulate solids. Because of these capabilities, <b>bypass</b> {{pneumatic conveying}} <b>systems</b> have been used in coal-fired power stations for removing fly ash {{for the last couple of}} decades. In <b>bypass</b> <b>systems,</b> the differential pressure between bypass pipe and main pipe as well as the pipeline pressure drop are two of most significant parameters as differential pressure represents the aeration mechanism within the pipeline while pressure drop is an essential parameter for <b>bypass</b> pneumatic conveying <b>system</b> design. In <b>bypass</b> <b>systems,</b> these two parameters are determined not only by the turbulent mode of the gas solids two-phase flow but also by the bypass configurations. The objective of this study was to experimentally investigate the differential pressure between bypass pipe and main pipe as well as the pressure drop during the bypass pneumatic conveying of fly ash. Pneumatic conveying tests in <b>bypass</b> <b>systems</b> and a conventional pipeline were carried out in this study. The bypass pipeline was a 79 mm diameter main pipe with a 27 mm inner diameter bypass pipe with orifice plate flute arrangement.

40|$|Abstract: The {{importance}} of an unaffected fish migration in rivers to maintain or establish near-natural fish communities represents a scientific {{and a social}} consensus. This is underlined by European laws as the European Water Directive, demanding the ecological connectivity of rivers. In the last decades increasingly fish protection and <b>bypass</b> <b>systems</b> were developed and installed to reduce mortality at hydro power plants and water abstraction facilities. To prove their efficiency, usually a site-adapted monitoring is necessary. Until now neither German nor European standards for a recommended monitoring design are available. This leads to inconsistent methodological approaches, concerning sampling design and data analysis of individual studies. Therefore results of those studies are hard to compare. Generally links of causes and effects might be masked by methodological background noise. The German Federal Environment Agency (UBA) therefore funded a report to {{provide the basis for}} a monitoring working guide including methodological guidelines for site specific evaluation process. The working guide in its current state provides guidelines for preparation, conduction of the experiment and data analysis. Its aim is to simplify the selection of the appropriate sampling methods, sampling time and target fishes (species and development stage). 20 metrics are given as quantitative base for an evaluation of fish protection and <b>bypass</b> <b>systems.</b> Metric thresholds for a sufficient site specific ecological connectivity are not given yet, {{due to the lack of}} a sufficient database for their calibration on ecological demands. The first version of the working guide will be revised and further updated under the direction of the German Association for Water, Wastewater and Waste (DWA). The presentation of the current state aims to facilitate the discussion of the methodological approach to evaluate fish protection and <b>bypass</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Dense phase {{pneumatic}} conveying is preferable over dilute phase conveying in many industries as lower transport velocities are beneficial due to reduced attrition of the particles and reduced wear. However, dense phase conveying is critically {{dependent on the}} physical properties of the materials to be conveyed. For many materials which are either erosive or fragile, they do not exhibit the physical properties required to be conveyed reliably in a low velocity, dense phase flow regime. This can be serious problem in the food, chemical and pharmaceutical industries. One satisfactory approach which has been widely applied {{is the use of}} <b>bypass</b> <b>systems.</b> <b>Bypass</b> {{pneumatic conveying}} <b>systems</b> provide the capacity of transporting some materials that are not naturally suitable for dense phase flow. <b>Bypass</b> pneumatic conveying <b>systems</b> also provide a passive capability to reduce minimum particulate transport velocities. In this study, pneumatic conveying experiments were carried out in a 79 mm diameter main pipe with a 27 mm inner diameter bypass pipe with orifice plate flute arrangement. Alumina, fly ash and sand were conveyed in the tests. High speed camera visualization was employed to study the flow regimes of <b>bypass</b> pneumatic transport <b>systems</b> and investigate the mechanism of material blockage inhibition provided by these systems.
