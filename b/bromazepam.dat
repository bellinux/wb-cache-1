5|$|In the United States, benzodiazepines are Schedule IV drugs {{under the}} Federal Controlled Substances Act, even when {{not on the}} market (for example, {{nitrazepam}} and <b>bromazepam).</b> Flunitrazepam is subject to more stringent regulations in certain states and temazepam prescriptions require specially coded pads in certain states.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, Canadian Psychiatric Association (CPA) {{recommends}} benzodiazepines alprazolam, <b>bromazepam,</b> lorazepam, and diazepam {{only as a}} second-line choice, if {{the treatment}} with two different antidepressants was unsuccessful. Although they are second-line agents, benzodiazepines {{can be used for}} a limited time to relieve severe anxiety and agitation. CPA guidelines note that after 4–6 weeks the effect of benzodiazepines may decrease to the level of placebo, and that benzodiazepines are less effective than antidepressants in alleviating ruminative worry, the core symptom of GAD. However, in some cases, a prolonged treatment with benzodiazepines as the add-on to an antidepressant may be justified.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> is {{pregnancy}} category D, {{a classification}} {{that means that}} <b>bromazepam</b> {{has been shown to}} cause harm to the unborn child. The Hoffman LaRoche product information leaflet warns against breast feeding while taking <b>bromazepam.</b> There has been at least one report of sudden infant death syndrome linked to breast feeding while consuming <b>bromazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|The active {{metabolite}} of <b>bromazepam</b> is hydroxybromazepam, {{which has}} a half-life approximately {{equal to that of}} <b>bromazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|Cimetidine, {{fluvoxamine}} and propranolol {{causes a}} marked {{increase in the}} elimination half-life of <b>bromazepam</b> leading to increased accumulation of <b>bromazepam.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> (marketed under several brand names, {{including}} Lectopam, Lexotan, Lexilium, Lexaurin, Brazepam, Rekotnil, Bromaze, Somalium and Lexotanil) is a benzodiazepine derivative drug, {{patented by}} Roche in 1963 and developed clinically in the 1970s. It is mainly an anti-anxiety agent with similar side effects to diazepam (Valium). In {{addition to being}} used to treat anxiety or panic states, <b>bromazepam</b> {{may be used as}} a premedicant prior to minor surgery. <b>Bromazepam</b> typically comes in doses of 3mg and 6mg tablets. <b>Bromazepam</b> is contraindicated and should be used with caution in women who are pregnant, the elderly, patients with a history of alcohol or other substance abuse disorders and children. Prolonged use of <b>bromazepam</b> causes tolerance and may lead to both physical and psychological dependence on the drug, and as a result, it is a medication which is controlled by international law.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> has {{a similar}} misuse risk as other benzodiazepines such as diazepam. In France car {{accidents}} involving psychotropic drugs in combination with alcohol (itself a major contributor) found benzodiazepines, mainly diazepam, nordiazepam, and <b>bromazepam,</b> {{to be the most}} common drug present in the blood stream, almost twice that of the next-most-common drug cannabis. <b>Bromazepam</b> has also been used in serious criminal offences including robbery, homicide, and sexual assault.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> binds to the GABA {{receptor}} GABAA, {{causing a}} conformational change {{and increasing the}} inhibitory effects of GABA. <b>Bromazepam</b> is a long-acting benzodiazepine and is lipophilic and metabolised hepatically via oxidative pathways. It does not possess any antidepressant or antipsychotic qualities.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> {{shares with}} other benzodiazepines {{the risk of}} abuse, misuse, {{psychological}} dependence or physical dependence. A withdrawal study demonstrated both psychological dependence and physical dependence on <b>bromazepam</b> including marked rebound anxiety after 4 weeks chronic use. Those whose dose was gradually reduced experienced no withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> {{may affect}} driving {{and ability to}} operate machinery.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> is a Schedule IV drug {{under the}} Convention on Psychotropic Substances.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> {{alters the}} {{electrical}} {{status of the}} brain causing an increase in beta activity {{and a decrease in}} alpha activity in EEG recordings.|$|E
25|$|After {{night time}} {{administration}} of <b>bromazepam</b> a highly significant reduction of gastric acid secretion occurs during sleep {{followed by a}} highly significant rebound in gastric acid production the following day.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{studies have}} shown that chronic {{administration}} of diazepam or <b>bromazepam</b> causes a decrease in spontaneous locomotor activity, decreased turnover of noradrenaline and dopamine and serotonin, increased activity of tyrosine hydroxylase and increased levels of the catecholamines. During withdrawal of <b>bromazepam</b> or diazepam a fall in tryptophan, serotonin levels occurs as part of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Changes in the levels of these chemicals in the brain can cause headaches, anxiety, tension, depression, insomnia, restlessness, confusion, irritability, sweating, dysphoria, dizziness, derealization, depersonalization, numbness/tingling of extremities, hypersensitivity to light, sound, and smell, perceptual distortions, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, appetite loss, hallucinations, delirium, seizures, tremor, stomach cramps, myalgia, agitation, palpitations, tachycardia, panic attacks, short-term memory loss, and hyperthermia.|$|E
25|$|Ambulatory {{patients}} should be warned that <b>bromazepam</b> may impair the ability to drive vehicles and to operate machinery. The impairment is worsened by consumption of alcohol, because both act as central nervous system depressants. During the course of therapy, tolerance to the sedative effect usually develops.|$|E
25|$|A 1985 {{study found}} that {{temazepam}} and triazolam maintained significantly higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. The study tested and compared the abuse liability of temazepam, triazolam, diazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, flurazepam, alprazolam, chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, nitrazepam, flunitrazepam, <b>bromazepam,</b> and clorazepate. The study tested self-injection rates on human, baboon, and rat subjects. All test subjects consistently showed a strong preference for temazepam and triazolam over {{all the rest of the}} benzodiazepines included in the study.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> is {{reported}} to be metabolized by a hepatic enzyme belonging to the Cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. In 2003, a team led by Dr. Oda Manami at Oita Medical University reported that CYP3A4, a member of the Cytochrome P450 family, was not the responsible enzyme since itraconazole, a known inhibitor of CYP3A4, did not affect its metabolism. In 1995, J. van Harten at Solvay Duphar B.V.'s Department of Clinical Pharmacology in Weesp reported that fluvoxamine, which is a potent inhibitor of CYP1A2, a less potent CYP3A4 inhibitor, and a negligible inhibitor of CYP2D6, does inhibit its metabolism.|$|E
25|$|Hydroxyzine is {{prescribed}} {{when the}} onset of an organic disease state manifests through anxiety, as generalized anxiety disorder, or in other more serious cases as psychoneurosis, and is therefore prescribed {{as a means of}} regulating normal function. Hydroxyzine has shown to be as effective as the benzodiazepine drug <b>bromazepam</b> in the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder. However, a systematic review concluded that compared with other anxiolytic agents (benzodiazepines and buspirone), hydroxyzine was equivalent in efficacy, acceptability and tolerability, however there is insufficient evidence to recommend it as a treatment for generalised anxiety disorder due to the high risk of bias in the reviewed studies.|$|E
25|$|In {{tests in}} {{pentobarbital}} trained rhesus monkeys benzodiazepines produced effects similar to barbiturates. In a 1991 study, triazolam {{had the highest}} self-administration rate in cocaine trained baboons, among the five benzodiazepines examined: alprazolam, <b>bromazepam,</b> chlordiazepoxide, lorazepam, triazolam. A 1985 study found that triazolam and temazepam maintained higher rates of self-injection than {{a variety of other}} benzodiazepines. A 1991 study indicated that diazepam, in particular, had a greater abuse liability among people who were drug abusers than did many of the other benzodiazepines. Some of the available data also suggested that lorazepam and alprazolam are more diazepam-like in having relatively high abuse liability, while oxazepam, halazepam, and possibly chlordiazepoxide, are relatively low in this regard. A 1991–1993 British study found that the hypnotics flurazepam and temazepam were more toxic than average benzodiazepines in overdose. A 1995 study found that temazepam is more rapidly absorbed and oxazepam is more slowly absorbed than most other benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|New {{research}} in the related field entomotoxicology is currently studying the effects of drugs {{on the development of}} insects who have fed on the decomposing tissue of a drug user. The effects of drugs and toxins on insect development are proving to be an important factor when determining the insect colonization time. It has been shown that cocaine use can accelerate the development of maggots. In one case, Lucilia sericata larvae that fed in the nasal cavity of a cocaine abuser, grew over 8mm longer than larvae of the same generation found elsewhere on the body. Other researchers in entomotoxicology are developing techniques to detect and measure drug levels in older fly pupae. This research is useful for determining cause of death for bodies that are found during later stages of decay. To this date, <b>bromazepam,</b> levomepromazine, malathion, phenobarbital, trazolam, oxazepam, alimemazine, clomipramine, morphine, mercury, and copper have been recovered from maggots.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> is {{commonly}} involved in drug overdoses. [...] A severe <b>bromazepam</b> benzodiazepine overdose {{may result in}} an alpha pattern coma type. The toxicity of <b>bromazepam</b> in overdosage increases when combined with other CNS depressant drugs such as alcohol or sedative hypnotic drugs. <b>Bromazepam</b> {{is the most common}} benzodiazepine involved in intentional overdoses in France. <b>Bromazepam</b> has also been responsible for accidental poisonings in companion animals. A review of benzodiazepine poisonings in cats and dogs from 1991-1994 found <b>bromazepam</b> to be responsible for significantly more poisonings than any other benzodiazepine.|$|E
2500|$|Patients {{treated with}} <b>bromazepam</b> for {{generalised}} anxiety disorder were found to experience withdrawal symptoms such as a [...] worsening of anxiety, {{as well as the}} development of physical withdrawal symptoms when abruptly withdrawn <b>bromazepam.</b> Abrupt or over rapid withdrawal from <b>bromazepam</b> after chronic use even at therapeutic prescribed doses can lead to a severe withdrawal syndrome including status epilepticus and a condition resembling delerium tremens.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> {{is similar}} in side effects to other benzodiazepines. The most common side effects {{reported}} are drowsiness, sedation, ataxia, memory impairment, and dizziness. Impairments to memory functions are common with <b>bromazepam</b> and include a reduced working memory and reduced ability to process environmental information. [...] A 1975 experiment on healthy, male college students exploring the effects of four different drugs on learning capacity observed that taking <b>bromazepam</b> alone at 6mg 3 times daily for 2 weeks impaired learning capacities significantly. In combination with alcohol, impairments in learning capacity became even more pronounced. Various studies report impaired memory, visual information processing and sensory data and impaired psychomotor performance; deterioration of cognition including attention capacity and impaired co-ordinative skills; impaired reactive and attention performance, which can impair driving skills; drowsiness and decrease in libido. Unsteadiness after taking <b>bromazepam</b> is, however, less pronounced than other benzodiazepines such as lorazepam.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bromazepam</b> is a [...] "{{classical}}" [...] benzodiazepine; other classical benzodiazepines include; diazepam, clonazepam, oxazepam, lorazepam, nitrazepam, flurazepam, and clorazepate. Its {{molecular structure}} {{is composed of}} a diazepine connected to a benzene ring and a pyridine ring, the benzene ring having a single nitrogen atom that replaces one of the carbon atoms in the ring structure. It is a 1,4-benzodiazepine, {{which means that the}} nitrogens on the seven-sided diazepine ring are in the 1 and 4 positions.|$|E
2500|$|Diazepam is a long-acting [...] "{{classical}}" [...] benzodiazepine. Other classical benzodiazepines include chlordiazepoxide, clonazepam, lorazepam, oxazepam, nitrazepam, temazepam, flurazepam, <b>bromazepam,</b> and clorazepate. Diazepam has anticonvulsant properties. Diazepam has {{no effect}} on GABA levels and no effect on glutamate decarboxylase activity, but has a slight effect on gamma-aminobutyric acid transaminase activity. It differs from some other anticonvulsive drugs with which it was compared. Benzodiazepines act via micromolar benzodiazepine binding sites as Ca2+ channel blockers and significantly inhibit depolarization-sensitive calcium uptake in rat nerve cell preparations.|$|E
2500|$|It {{can be too}} {{difficult}} to withdraw from short- or intermediate-acting benzodiazepines because of {{the intensity of the}} rebound symptoms felt between doses. Moreover, short-acting benzodiazepines appear to produce a more intense withdrawal syndrome. For this reason, discontinuation is sometimes carried out by first substituting an equivalent dose of a short-acting benzodiazepine with a longer-acting one like diazepam or chlordiazepoxide. Failure to use the correct equivalent amount can precipitate a severe withdrawal reaction. Benzodiazepines with a half-life of more than 24 hours include chlordiazepoxide, diazepam, clobazam, clonazepam, chlorazepinic acid, ketazolam, medazepam, nordazepam, and prazepam. [...] Benzodiazepines with a half-life of less than 24 hours include alprazolam, <b>bromazepam,</b> brotizolam, flunitrazepam, loprazolam, lorazepam, lormetazepam, midazolam, nitrazepam, oxazepam, and temazepam. The resultant equivalent dose is then gradually reduced. The reduction rate used in the Heather Ashton protocol calls for eliminating 10% of the remaining dose every two to four weeks, depending on the severity and response to reductions with the final dose at 0.5mg dose of diazepam or 5mg dose of chlordiazepoxide.|$|E
