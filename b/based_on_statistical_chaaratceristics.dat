40|$|The even-odd {{effect in}} fission is {{explained}} by a model <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>statistical</b> mechanics. It reveals that the variation of the even-odd effect with {{the mass of the}} fissioning nucleus and the increase towards asymmetric splits is due to the important statistical weight of configurations where the light fission fragment populates the ground state of an even-even nucleus. This implies that entropy drives excitation energy and unpaired nucleons predominantly to the heavy fragment. Therefore, the even-odd effect is an additional signature of the recently discovered energy-sorting process in fission. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures.
