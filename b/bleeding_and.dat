5|$|With {{regards to}} {{digestive}} tract lesions, mild <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> mild resultant anemia is treated with iron supplementation, and no specific treatment is administered. There is limited data on hormone treatment and tranexamic acid to reduce <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> anemia. Severe anemia or episodes of severe bleeding {{are treated with}} endoscopic argon plasma coagulation (APC) or laser treatment of any lesions identified; this may {{reduce the need for}} supportive treatment. The expected benefits are not such that repeated attempts at treating lesions are advocated. Sudden, very severe bleeding is unusual—if encountered, alternative causes (such as a peptic ulcer) need to be considered—but embolization may be used in such instances.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{can cause}} {{prolonged}} bleeding after operations {{for up to}} 10 days. In one study, 30 of 6499 people having elective surgery required reoperations to control bleeding. Twenty had diffuse <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> 10 had bleeding from a site. Diffuse, but not discrete, bleeding {{was associated with the}} preoperative use of aspirin alone or in combination with other NSAIDS in 19 of the 20 diffuse bleeding people.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include an upset stomach. More {{significant}} side effects include stomach ulcers, stomach <b>bleeding,</b> <b>and</b> worsening asthma. Bleeding risk is greater {{among those who}} are older, drink alcohol, take other NSAIDs, or are on blood thinners. Aspirin is not recommended in the last part of pregnancy. It is not generally recommended in children with infections because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. High doses may result in ringing in the ears.|$|E

5|$|Emergency {{medical care}} applies to other acute health {{problems}} as well. Many illnesses with time-sensitive elements {{are common in}} developing countries, including severe infections, hypoxia caused by respiratory infections, dehydration caused by diarrhoea, intentional and unintentional injuries, postpartum <b>bleeding,</b> <b>and</b> acute myocardial infarction. These are potentially life-threatening conditions, yet effective treatment is often unavailable {{for much of the}} world's population.|$|E
5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic {{digestive}} tract <b>bleeding,</b> <b>and</b> various problems due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect on}} sexual desire is varied, with {{increase}} or decrease in some but with no effect in most. Combined oral contraceptives {{reduce the risk of}} ovarian cancer and endometrial cancer and do not change the risk of breast cancer.

The lower doses of estrogen released from the vaginal ring may reduce the risk of breast tenderness, nausea, and headache associated with higher dose estrogen products.|$|E

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of AML {{are caused by}} replacement of normal bone marrow with leukemic cells, which causes a drop in red blood cells, platelets, and normal white blood cells. These symptoms include fatigue, shortness of breath, easy bruising and <b>bleeding,</b> <b>and</b> increased risk of infection. Several risk factors and chromosomal abnormalities have been identified, but the specific cause is not clear. As an acute leukemia, AML progresses rapidly and is typically fatal within weeks or months if left untreated.|$|E

In February 2007, Raúl announced that Fidel's health was improving {{and that he}} was taking part in important issues of government. Later that month, Fidel called into Hugo Chávez's radio show Aló Presidente. On April 21, Castro met Wu Guanzheng of the Chinese Communist Party's Politburo, with Chávez visiting in August, and Morales in September. That month, the Non-Aligned Movement held its 14th Summit in Havana, there agreeing to appoint Castro as the organisation's president for a year's term.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{would often}} spend {{weekends}} {{with his parents}} in Saskatoon. While there, he began to woo Olive Freeman, daughter of the Baptist minister, but in 1921, she moved with her family to Brandon, Manitoba, and the two lost touch for more than 20 years. He then courted Beth Newell, a cashier in Saskatoon, and by 1922, the two were engaged. However, in 1923, Newell was diagnosed with tuberculosis, and Diefenbaker broke off contact with her. She died the following year. Diefenbaker was himself subject to internal <b>bleeding,</b> <b>and</b> may have feared that the disease would be transmitted to him. In late 1923, he had an operation at the Mayo Clinic for a gastric ulcer, but his health remained uncertain for several more years.|$|E

5|$|From the history, {{indicators}} of pulpal, periodontal, {{a combination of}} both, or non-dental causes can be observed. Periodontal pain is frequently localized to a particular tooth, which is made much worse by biting on the tooth, sudden in onset, and associated with <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> pain when brushing. More than one factor {{may be involved in}} the toothache. For example, a pulpal abscess (which is typically severe, spontaneous and localized) can cause periapical periodontitis (which results in pain on biting). Cracked tooth syndrome may also cause a combination of symptoms. Lateral periodontitis (which is usually without any thermal sensitivity and sensitive to biting) can cause pulpitis and the tooth becomes sensitive to cold.|$|E
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites {{can be divided into}} two symptomatic categories: those with little or no surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E

Inside the shop, the barber, who may be drunk, haphazardly shaves a customer, holding his nose like that of a pig, while spots of blood darken the cloth under his chin. The {{surgeons}} and barbers had been a single profession since 1540 and would not finally separate until 1745, when the surgeons broke away to form the Company of Surgeons. Bowls on the windowsill contain blood from the day's patients.|$|E

5|$|Placement {{of dental}} {{implants}} is a surgical procedure and carries the normal risks of surgery including infection, excessive <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> necrosis of the flap of tissue around the implant. Nearby anatomic structures, {{such as the}} inferior alveolar nerve, the maxillary sinus and blood vessels, can also be injured when the osteotomy is created or the implant placed. Even when {{the lining of the}} maxillary sinus is perforated by an implant, long term sinusitis is rare. An inability to place the implant in bone to provide stability of the implant (referred to as primary stability of the implant) increases the risk of failure to osseointegration.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>and</b> increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E
5|$|The eggs of the puffadder shyshark are fed {{upon by the}} whelks Burnupena papyracea and B. lagenaria, {{at least}} in captivity. Known parasites of this species include the {{trypanosome}} Trypanosoma haploblephari, which infests the blood, the nematode Proleptus obtusus, which infests the intestine, and the copepods Charopinus dalmanni and Perissopus oblongatus, which infest the skin. Another parasite is the praniza larval stage of the isopod Gnathia pantherina, which infests the nares, mouth, and gills. The deep-penetrating mouthparts of these larvae significantly damage local tissue, causing <b>bleeding</b> <b>and</b> inflammation.|$|E
