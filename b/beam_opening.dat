40|$|Direct {{confirmation}} that low-frequency Jovian hectometric (HOM) radio emissions centered near 0 deg central meridian longitude consist of distinct, oppositely polarized {{northern and southern}} beams has been achieved {{using data from the}} Unified Radio and Plasma Wave (URAP) experiment on the Ulysses spacecraft during the Ulysses-Jupiter encounter in early February 1992. Distinct northern and southern beams were observed in the frequency range from approximately 300 kHz to 1 MHz for at least eight Jovian rotations during the Ulysses inbound pass at distances from 100 to 40 R(sub j). The radiation from the two magnetic hemispheres was measured from different Jovigraphic longitudes and magnetic (or centrifugal) latitudes. Observed temporal variations in the radio intensities, with time scales on the order of 30 min, may result either from longitudinal variations of the HOM sources or from longitudinal density variations in the Io plasma torus. Using the URAP direction-finding capabilities and assuming a tilted dipole planetary magnetic field model, the three-dimensional HOM source locations, the L shell through these source locations, and the <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angles were independently deduced.

40|$|Twenty-odd years ago, {{scientists}} {{managed to}} produce several new techniques for manipulating certain properties of laser and microwave radiation. These new properties {{made it possible}} for the radiation to contain a lot more information than what was previously known. What they had discovered was that light could be twisted, thereby not only carrying polarization, also known as spin angular momentum (SAM) but also orbital angular momentum (OAM). Radar beams are used by scientists to probe the earth’s ionosphere. By measuring the echo of the radar waves one can deduce a lot of information, such as density and temperature of the plasma. In this thesis we will expand an existing program (iscatspb 0. m) which computes the spectrum of plasma fluctuations as seen with an incoherent scatter radar, to having it incorporate radar beams carrying OAM, to see what new information of the plasma can be obtained. The three major findings in this thesis were what magnitude of the integer l is needed in order for the contribution of OAM to equal the contribution for the <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angle, how much the radar <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angle affected the measurements and in what way the spectrum obtained by a twisted beam is affected by different flow...|$|E

40|$|Precursors and postcursors (PPCs) {{are rare}} {{emission}} components detected {{in a handful}} of pulsars that appear beyond the main pulse emission, in some cases far away from it. In this paper we attempt to characterize the PPC emission in relation to the pulsar main pulse geometry. In our analysis we find that PPC components have properties very different from that of outer conal emission. The separation of the PPC components from the main pulse center remains constant with frequency. In addition the <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angles corresponding to the separation of PPC components from the pulsar center are much larger than the largest encountered in conal emission. Pulsar radio emission is believed to originate within the magnetic polar flux tubes due to the growth of instabilities in the outflowing relativistic plasma. Observationally, there is strong evidence that the main pulse emission originates at altitudes of about 50 neutron star radii for a canonical pulsar. Currently, the most plausible radio emission model that can explain main pulse emission is the coherent curvature radiation mechanism, wherein relativistic charged solitons are formed in a non-stationary electron-positron-pair plasma. The wider <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angles of PPC require the emission to emanate from larger altitudes as compared to the main pulse, if both these components originate by the same emission mechanism. We explore this possibility and find that this emission mechanism is probably inapplicable {{at the height of the}} PPC emission. We propose that the PPC emission represents a new type of radiation from pulsars with a mechanism different from that of the main pulse.

We include curved spacetime effects on photon trajectories and magnetic field. The observed gamma-ray pulse profiles are double peaked with phase separations of 0. 4 - 0. 5 between the peaks.

To achieve this objective, precise and unambiguous detection of the water-bottom interface is required, which raises the issue of bottom detection, especially in the outer beams. The bottom-detection method implemented in the ME 70 is based on the amplitude of the reverberated echo.

In such a conic beam, the relativistic ejecta may have a spatial variation in the bulk Lorentz factor and the density distribution of gamma-ray emitting jet material. An apparent luminosity function arises because the axis of the cone is randomly oriented with respect to the observer’s line of sight. The width and the shape of the luminosity function are determined by the ratio of the <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angle of the conical jet to the inverse of the bulk Lorentz factor, when the bulk Lorentz factor and the jet material density is uniform on the photon emitting jet surface. We calculate effects of spatial variation of the Lorentz factor and the spatial density fluctuations within the cone on the luminosity function and the statistics of gamma-ray bursts. In particular, we focus on the redshift distribution of the observed gamma-ray bursts. The maximum distance to and the average redshift of the gamma-ray bursts are strongly affected by the beaming-induced luminosity function. The bursts with the angle-dependent Lorentz factor which peaks at the center of the cone have substantially higher average gamma-ray burst redshifts. When both the jet material density and the Lorentz factor are inhomogeneous in the conical beam, the average redshift of the bursts could be 5 times higher than that of the case in which relativistic jet is completely homogeneous and structureless.

But should we expect {{to be able to}} intercept these unintentional signals? And what constraints can we place upon the frequency of intelligent civilisations if we do? We carry out Monte Carlo Realisation simulations of interstellar communications between civilisations in the Galactic Habitable Zone (GHZ) using collimated beams. We measure the frequency with which beams between two stars are intercepted by a third. The interception rate increases linearly with the fraction of communicating civilisations, and as the cube of the <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angle, which is somewhat stronger than theoretical expectations, which we argue is due to the geometry of the GHZ. We find that for an annular GHZ containing 10, 000 civilisations, intersections are unlikely unless the beams are relatively uncollimated. These results indicate that optical SETI is more likely to find signals deliberately directed at the Earth than accidentally intercepting collimated communications. Equally, civilisations wishing to establish a network of communicating species may use weakly collimated beams to build up the network through interception, if they are willing to pay a cost penalty that is lower than that meted by fully isotropic beacons. Future SETI searches should consider the possibility that communicating civilisations will attempt {{to strike a balance between}} optimising costs and encouraging contact between civilisations, and look for weakly collimated pulses as well as narrow-beam pulses directed deliberately at the Earth.

The outcome of experimental investigation elaborates the difference in the shear behaviour of deep beams based on depth and location of circular openings variation. 457 mm (18 in) deep <b>beam</b> with <b>openings</b> above NA show the highest strength and 381 mm (15 in) deep <b>beam</b> with <b>openings</b> below NA show the least strength.

30|$|We {{used the}} Geant 4 {{simulation}} toolkit [16]. A numerical voxel phantom was created with the XCAT program [17] (voxel size 2 × 2 × 2  mm 3). Each voxel {{was assigned to}} an organ. Considering the thyroid gland is as an extended organ with an inhomogeneous dose distribution, the dose was calculated based on the real anatomic situation implemented in the voxel phantom. Accumulated dose was calculated by absorbed energy divided by the voxel mass. The x-ray beam was modelled by electrons with kinetic energies of 28 or 35  keV hitting a W-target inclined at 20 °. The radiation was filtered with 50 -μm Rh according to the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration manual specifications. The <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angle was chosen to fully cover the compression plate. In the model, the x-ray head was simplified as a lead cube of 1 -mm wall thickness (shielding of 1 E- 9 at 35  keV) with a rectangular hole in the bottom. Distances and dimensions were modelled according to the Siemens Mammomat Inspiration manual specifications and on-site measurements. The breast tissue {{was assumed to be}} a mixture of fat and glandular tissue (ratio 3 : 2). According to Verdù et al. [18], different breast tissue compositions have been investigated and the uncertainty of tissue composition onto the glandular dose was estimated to be ±[*] 10 % for adipose tissue ratios of 40 %, 50 % and 60 %. From the simulated thyroid dose of approximately 100 pGy, we expected a fluence of 59  cm− 2 through the thyroid. Assuming an area of 4  cm 2 for the thyroid, we expected 200 photons with an additional uncertainty of 7 %. A standard low-energy package was used as recommended in literature [19]. The MCS toolkit was used to calculate all organ doses defined by the ICRP 103 recommendations [20]. The effective dose was calculated {{on the basis of these}} organ doses by applying the ICRP 103 model.|$|E
40|$|Seafloor {{classification}} using acoustic {{remote sensing}} techniques {{is an attractive}} approach due to its high coverage capabilities and limited costs compared to taking samples of the seafloor. This paper focuses on the characterization of sediments in a coastal environment by combining different hydrographic systems, which are a multibeam echosounder (MBES), a single-beam echosounder (SBES), and seismic systems. The area is located close {{to the west coast}} of Italy, southeast of Elba Island, which is known to be composed of very fine-grained material. Both MBES and SBES are, in general, high-frequency systems (> 100 kHz), providing bathymetry and backscatter information of {{the upper part of the}} sea bottom. MBES systems provide this information with a high resolution, due to the <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> angle of typically 1 °– 3 °, and high coverage. An SBES provides measurements directly underneath the ship only, but is widespread. For the classification by means of MBES data, we use the Bayesian approach, employing backscatter measurements per beam. For the SBES, echo shape parameters are determined and are combined in a principal component analysis (PCA). Both approaches give results that are in very good agreement with respect to the distribution of different surficial sediment types. Complementary, low-frequency seismic systems (< 20 kHz) give insight into the sediment layering. Combining the different acoustic approaches is shown to be an essential ingredient for establishing the environmental picture. This picture is of use for a large range of applications, such as habitat mapping, cable laying, or mine hunting. For the current research, it is aimed to act as a basis for selecting areas for subseafloor sediment classification by geoacoustic inversion techniques. Contrary to the hydrographic systems, geoacoustic inversion techniques provide the actual physical properties, i. e., densities, compression and shear wave speeds, and respective attenuations of the sediment body, and allow sediment characterization over large areas without the need to cover the complete area. A validation is given that the environmental picture, obtained by the hydrographic systems, indeed identifies regions with different acoustic properties...|$|E
40|$|Up until now, {{treatment}} {{planning in}} Boron Neutron Capture Therapy is only performed using Monte Carlo-based techniques. The conventional radiotherapy community {{has become more}} interested in such techniques, as they are impressed by the accuracy {{that can be achieved}} with Monte Carlo calculations. However, a disadvantage of the method is still the long times needed to obtain results with reliable statistics. Although computer power has become faster and cheaper over the years, it is still impossible to calculate a hundred or more different beam positions within a few days, which is the time a treatment planner in BNCT normally needs to produce an acceptable plan. With more calculated beam positions, a better treatment plan can be composed which can maximise the dose in the tumours whilst sparing the organs at risk. In normal (forward) Monte Carlo calculations, the particles start at the <b>beam</b> <b>opening</b> and travel into the tissue where {{they may or may not}} hit a target, e. g. tumour, organ at risk. In adjoint Monte Carlo calculations, the particles start at the target and travel out of the tissue to where the information is recorded. This information can be translated as if the particle started at the place of recording. With this method, the same information is gathered as with forward Monte Carlo but instantly all around the irradiated tissue. In a realistic head phantom with 10 organs at risk and 10 tumours, the adjoint techniques are 1. 8 to 3. 3 times faster than the forward MC calculations when 1020 different orientations of a gamma beam with a diameter larger than 5 cm are simulated. In the case of a neutron beam, the adjoint technique is faster by 6. 6 to 20 times, than the forward MC. In general, in the case of small diameter beams, adjoint MC calculations are only preferable for a large number of beams and a small number of regions of interest. For larger beam sizes, the adjoint method is more favourable than the forward calculations when there are fewer beams and/or many regions of interest. JRC.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} fibre reinforced concrete in carrying structures. The basis of the project is shear capacity of <b>beams</b> with <b>openings</b> {{which is a very}} common structural element. It has been carried out full-scale tests of one reference beam and three <b>beams</b> with <b>openings</b> reinforced with different reinforcement combinations. The first part of the report consists of a literature study based on earlier research and published material on fibre reinforced concrete and its use in carrying structures. Different fibres and their properties are described as well as the components in concrete and their effect. As of today there are no official set of rules for designing fibre reinforced structures, but there are several suggestions for rules which are described in the report. The most important set of rules for this project is made by COIN (Concrete Innovation Centre). The calculations done in the project are based on the COIN-report. The concrete used in the tests were delivered by Unicon and the castings were done in two days, one casting with plain concrete (reference beam and one <b>beam</b> with <b>openings</b> with traditional shear reinforcement) and one casting with fibre reinforcement (Dramix 80 / 60). The fibre reinforced <b>beams</b> with <b>openings</b> consisted of one beam with a combination of fibre and traditional shear reinforcement and one with only fibres as shear reinforcement. The casting of the fibre reinforced concrete proved difficult as the fibres were lumping together and deteriorated the flowability. Therefore the FRC required a lot of work while being cast. In addition to the full-scale beams standard beams and testing cubes were cast. These were later tested to establish the strength properties of the concrete. The tests showed that both the compressive strength and the residual tensile strength were higher than the theoretical values used in the pre-testing calculations, so post-testing calculations were carried out as well. The full-scale beams were tested at the structural laboratory at NTNU. The testing was done in a rig with a four point testing set-up with two symmetrical loads. The beams were instrumented to measure the midspan vertical displacement as well as the crack openings beneath the openings and a computer registered the measured values. Both the fibre reinforced beams proved to have better capacity and ductility than the plain concrete beams. This indicates that steel fibre reinforcement is a good solution for shear reinforcement for <b>beams</b> with <b>openings.</b> Most of the calculations done were in good accordance with the test results although they were a bit on the conservative side. The calculations for the beam with only fibre reinforcement were not very good, and post-testing calculations were done to find the width of a theoretical tensile trajectory based on the real capacity. All in all the tests showed that the use of FRC in <b>beams</b> with <b>openings</b> might be a good solution in the future. More research should be done on this subject to develop design rules for FRC <b>beams</b> with <b>openings.</b> </p...|$|R
