This paper starts by outlining {{the range of}} skills and information {{that need to be}} integrated for successful communication and moves on to how these skills can be assessed to obtain a detailed profile of a child's communicative competence. Five characteristic profiles of limited communicative competence are then described.

40|$|In recent years, {{bullying}} {{in schools}} has gained consider-able media attention with reports of high profile shootings in schools by students who subsequently report having been humiliated {{on a regular}} basis by their peers. While these extreme occurrences are rare, the association of these events with bullying has prompted researchers to question how common bullying is and how it affects targeted children and adolescents. (For a definition and discussion of the terms “bullying ” and “harassment”, see the <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 14). National studies have found that: • 8 % of 6 th- 10 th graders nationally say they are bullied once a week or more (Nansel, 2001). • 68 % of 12 to 15 year-old students describe teasing and bullying as a “big problem ” for people their age (Nickel-odeon/Kaiser Family Foundation, 2001). • 90 % of those bullied report psychological conse-quences, including a drop in grades, increased anxiety, and loss of friends or social life (Glew, 2000). This issue of Data Watch recognizes bullying and harassment as a major public health problem which is both widespread and potentially a serious threat to {{the health and well-being of}} children and youth living in King County. The information comes primarily from two sources. General countywide and state data concerning experiences commonly associated with bullying (e. g., object of rumors or lies, called names or insulted, shoved/ pushed, threatened with physical harm) are from the Washington State Survey of Adolescent Health Behav-iors (WSSAHB) which was conducted in the fall of 2000.

40|$|Since 1950 China has {{transformed}} {{itself from the}} sick man of Asia' to a country with better than average health indices for its level of national income. This achievement was due {{to a number of}} factors including a dramatic fall in the prevalence of severe poverty, improvements in the rural environment, increases in levels of literacy and the provision of services to meet priority health needs. The development of the health sector paralleled the establishment of a command economy organised into state-owned enterprises in the cities and agricultural collectives, called communes, in the countryside. Its structure reflected this economic and administrative environment. It was controlled jointly by the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) and the Communist Party through a tightly organised hierarchy. The health services mobilised the population in public health campaigns and provided almost universal access to preventive programmes and basic curative care. During the late 1970 s the government began to introduce market-oriented reforms and devolve its financial management. For several years the School of Public Health of the Shanghai Medical University, in collaboration with the Institute of Development Studies in England, has been studying the impact of these changes on rural health services. This paper outlines the problems which health services in poor rural counties face and proposes a strategy for reform. The major points it makes are summarised in the <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 2 and the research findings which led to these recommendations are presented in the Annex.

40|$|Now, {{decades after}} the first {{environmental}} laws were passed in this country, policymakers face many choices when seeking to solve environmental problems. Will taxing polluters for their discharges {{be more effective than}} fining them for not meeting certain emissions standards? Will a regulatory agency find it less costly to enforce a ban or oversee a system of tradable permits? Which strategy will reduce a pollutant the quickest? Clearly, there are no "one-size-fits-all" answers. Many factors enter into the decision to favor either policies that lean more toward economic incentives (EI) and toward direct regulation, commonly referred to as command-and-control (CAC) policy. Underlying determinants include a country's governmental and regulatory infrastructure, along with the nature of the environmental problem itself. Even with these contextual factors to consider, {{we thought it would be}} useful to compare EI and CAC policies and their outcomes in a real-world setting. To do this, we looked at six environmental problems that the United States and at least one European country dealt with differently (see <b>box</b> <b>on</b> <b>page</b> 14.) For each problem, one approach was more of an EI measure, while the other relied more on CAC. For example, to reduce point-source industrial water pollution, the Netherlands implemented a system of fees for organic pollutants (EI), while the United States established a system of guidelines and permits (CAC). It turned out, in fact, that most policies had at least some elements of both approaches, but we categorized them as EI or CAC based on their dominant features. We then asked researchers who had previously studied these policies on either side of the Atlantic to update or prepare new case studies. We analyzed the 12 case studies (two for each of the six environmental problems) against a list of hypotheses frequently made for or against EI and CAC, such as which instrument is more effective or imposes less administrative burden...|$|E
