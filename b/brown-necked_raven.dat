50|$|The common raven and {{carrion crow}} have {{been blamed for}} killing weak lambs and are often seen eating freshly dead corpses {{probably}} killed by other means. The Australian raven has been documented chasing, attacking, and seriously injuring lambs. Rooks have been blamed for eating grain in the UK and <b>brown-necked</b> <b>ravens</b> for raiding date crops in desert countries.|$|R
50|$|The reserve {{has been}} {{identified}} by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports significant numbers of the populations of various bird species, either as residents, or as overwintering, breeding or passage migrants. These include red-crested pochards, pygmy cormorants, saker falcons, common coots, common cranes, pale-backed pigeons, pallid scops-owls, Egyptian nightjars, white-winged woodpeckers, <b>brown-necked</b> <b>ravens,</b> great tits, desert larks, streaked scrub-warblers, Sykes's warblers, Asian desert warblers, saxaul sparrows and desert finches.|$|R
50|$|This species occurs principally in Somalia, Djibouti, the Ogaden and the Northern Frontier District in the Horn of Africa, {{and can be}} {{distinguished}} from the larger <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven</b> C. ruficollis by its call, appearance and differences in its behaviour.|$|E

50|$|Birds of this {{ecoregion}} include wheatears (Oenanthe isabellina, O. deserti), {{desert warbler}} (Sylvia nana), <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (Corvus ruficollis), the endangered houbara bustard (Chlamydotis undulata), black-bellied sandgrouse (Pterocles orientalis), golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), steppe eagle (Aquila rapax), Egyptian vulture (Neophron percnopterus), and the saker falcon (Falco cherrug).|$|E
50|$|This crow {{is thought}} to be closer to the pied crow C. albus by some authorities, {{especially}} in its behaviour, than to the <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven.</b> Hybrid birds between the pied crow and the Somali crow appear to reinforce this close relationship where the two species meet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{voice is}} very similar to the common raven's {{consisting}} mainly of croaks, though higher in pitch; and a harsh [...] "karr-karr-karr". In flight, it will utter a [...] "kuerk-kuerk" [...] call. Like all corvids, the <b>Brown-necked</b> <b>raven</b> is capable of vocal mimicry, however this behavior is mostly recorded in captivity and, although rarely, in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The {{white-necked raven}} (Corvus albicollis) is {{somewhat}} smaller (50-54 cm in length) than the common raven or indeed its nearest relative, the thick-billed raven C. crassirostris. Like the common raven, thick-billed raven and <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven,</b> {{it is one}} of the larger raven species. The smaller raven species are the Australian raven, forest raven, little raven, fan-tailed raven and Chihuahuan raven with the thick-billed raven being the world's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest.|$|E
50|$|Food is {{invariably}} {{taken on}} the ground and includes all manner of insects and other invertebrates, grain taken from animal dung, carrion and scraps of human food. It has also been seen taking skin parasites from camels and, where not persecuted, scavenges around rubbish dumps and camp sites. Fruits of all types are eaten readily. It soars and plays in thermals even more so than other raven species and often associates with the <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven</b> roosting in the same tree as it.|$|E
50|$|The {{fan-tailed raven}} (Corvus rhipidurus) is a {{passerine}} bird of the crow family native to Eastern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Like the Forest raven, Little raven, Australian raven and Chihuahuan raven, {{it is one}} of the smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the Common raven, Thick-billed raven, White-necked raven and <b>Brown-necked</b> <b>raven</b> with the Common and Thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the Little and Fan-tailed ravens being the smallest, in fact it is about the same size or slightly larger than the carrion crow (47-51 cm) but with a much thicker bill, shorter tail and much larger wings.|$|E

50|$|The Raso lark is {{threatened}} by predators such as the Cape Verde giant gecko and birds such as the lesser Cape Verde kestrel, <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven,</b> and Cape Verde barn owl, which {{make it difficult for}} them to survive. Additionally, Raso larks are vulnerable to the threat of accidental introduction of cats, dogs, rats by fishermen or other visitors to the island. Within the habitat of the Raso lark, the Cape Verde giant geckos weigh roughly 100 g and include juvenile birds in their diet. The Cape Verde Giant Gecko eats most chicks and eggs before they are hatched and fledged. Many aspects of the speciesâ€™ ecology and behaviour closely resemble that of the Eurasian skylark.|$|E
50|$|The Chihuahuan raven (Corvus cryptoleucus) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Corvidae that is native to the United States and Mexico. It was {{formerly}} known as the American white-necked raven, and has the proportions of a common raven with a heavy bill, but is about the same size as a carrion crow, or slightly larger than the American crow (44 - 51 cm long). The plumage is all-black with a rich purple-blue gloss in good light. Like the forest raven, little raven, fan-tailed raven and Australian raven, {{it is one of the}} smaller raven species. The larger species of raven are the common raven, thick-billed raven, white-necked raven and <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven,</b> with the common and thick-billed ravens being the world's largest raven species and the little and fan-tailed ravens being the smallest. The Chihuahuan raven is very similar in appearance to the Australian raven, although with dark brown irises and whiter feather bases. The nasal bristles extend farther down the top of the bill than in any other Corvus species to about two-thirds the length. The base of the neck feathers are white-ish (seen only when ruffled in strong wind). The bill, legs and feet are black.|$|E
50|$|The <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (Corvus ruficollis) is {{a larger}} bird (52-56 cm in length) than the carrion crow though not {{as large as the}} common raven. It has similar {{proportions}} to the common raven but the bill is not so large or deep and the wings tend {{to be a little more}} pointed in profile. The head and throat are a distinct brownish-black giving the bird its English name, while the rest of the plumage is black glossed with purple, blue or purplish-blue. Like the Common raven, Thick-billed raven and White-necked raven, it is one of the larger raven species. The smaller raven species are the Australian raven, Forest raven, Little raven, Fan-tailed raven and Chihuahuan raven with the Thick-billed raven being the world's largest raven species and the Chihuahuan raven being the smallest. The feathers of this species often fade quite quickly to a brownish black (even the truly black feathers) and the bird can look distinctly brown by the time it moults. The feet, legs and bill are black. The dwarf raven was formerly considered a subspecies (Corvus ruficollis edithae) but this bird now appears to be closer to the pied crow (C. albus) than this species.|$|E
50|$|A {{major threat}} to this species is habitat loss and disturbance. Human {{activity}} such as tourists walking through protected areas, pollution, unsustainable harvesting and urbanisation can destroy nesting sites. Plover populations can also be affected by rural human activity, for example fishermen walking through protected plover breeding sites, bringing large amounts of dogs with them- a known predator of plover eggs. Natural predators are also a problem, {{as many of these}} predators appear to thrive unnaturally well in the presence of plover breeding grounds, such as the <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (Corvus ruficollis) in Maio, Cape Verde, the White-tailed Mongoose (Ichneumia albicauda) in Saudi Arabia, and the Grey Monitors (Varanus griseus) in Al Wathba Wetland Reserve. It is thought that the high amount of prey available to these predators attracts them into the breeding grounds- an effect named the â€˜honey potâ€™, Global warming and climate change also plays a role in the decline of areas available for plovers to breed and reside in. It is known that the Kentish plover prefers to build its nests on low-elevated land close to water, and a study untaken in Saudi Arabia discovered that 11% of nests in the study site were in fact below sea level, therefore rising sea levels are predicted to have disastrous consequences for these low-sitting nests,.|$|E
40|$|Previous studies {{based on}} single {{mitochondrial}} markers {{have shown that}} the common raven (Corvus corax) consists of two highly diverged lineages that are hypothesised to have undergone speciation reversal upon secondary contact. Furthermore, common ravens are paraphyletic with respect to the Chihuahuan raven (C. cryptoleucus) based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Here we explore the causes of mtDNA paraphyly by sequencing whole mitochondrial genomes of 12 common ravens from across the Northern Hemisphere, in addition to three Chihuahuan ravens and one closely related <b>brown-necked</b> <b>raven</b> (C. ruficollis) using a long-range PCR protocol. Our raven mitogenomes ranged between 16925 - 16928 bp in length. GC content varied from 43. 3 % to 43. 8 % and the 13 protein coding genes, two rRNAs and 22 tRNAs followed a standard avian mitochondrial arrangement. The overall divergence between the two common raven clades was 3 % (range 0. 3 - 5. 8 % in 16 regions including the protein coding genes, rRNAs and the control region). Phylogenies constructed from whole mitogenomes recovered the previously found mitochondrial sister relationship between the common raven California clade and the Chihuahuan raven (overall divergence 1. 1 %), which strengthens the hypothesis that mtDNA paraphyly in the common raven results from speciation reversal of previously distinct Holarctic and California lineages...|$|E
