5|$|Convergent {{evolution}} in humans includes blue eye colour and light skin colour. When humans migrated out of Africa, {{they moved to}} more northern latitudes with less intense sunlight. It was beneficial to them to reduce their skin pigmentation. It appears certain {{that there was some}} lightening of skin colour before European and East Asian lineages diverged, as there are some skin-lightening genetic differences that are common to <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> However, after the lineages diverged and became genetically isolated, the skin of <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> lightened more, and that additional lightening was due to different genetic changes.|$|E
5|$|Division I {{is split}} into two groups of six, <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> play in round robin tournaments {{independent}} {{of each other and}} the championship division.

Beginning in 2012, the top two teams from the 'A' group will be promoted to the championship, the bottom team will be exchanged with the group 'B' winner, and that group's last place team will go down to Division II.|$|E

5|$|ACLU {{leadership}} was divided {{on how to}} challenge the civil rights violations. One faction, including Baldwin, Arthur Garfield Hays and Norman Thomas, believed that direct, militant action was the best path. Hays {{was the first of}} many successful attorneys that relinquished their private practices to work for the ACLU. Another group, including Walter Nelles and Walter Pollak felt that lawsuits taken to the Supreme Court were the best way to achieve change. <b>Both</b> <b>groups</b> worked in tandem, but equally revered the Bill of Rights and the US Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Another study {{suggested}} that EFS {{might contribute to}} acute rheumatic fever susceptibility. In this work, {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) from patients with rheumatoid heart disease (RHD) and control subjects that had never experienced acute rheumatoid fever were stimulated with rheumatogenic and non-rheumatogenic group A streptococci (GAS) strains. EFS was one of only four genes with significantly increased expression in both arms of the study: 1) RHD patient versus control PBMCs after stimulation of <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> with rheumatogenic GAS and 2) RHD patient PBMC stimulated with rheumatogenic versus non-rheumatogenic GAS.|$|E

5|$|Argentina {{allied with}} Brazil, Uruguay and Peru, three {{countries}} that had also recently ended their local military dictatorships, to mediate {{in the conflict}} between the United States and the Nicaraguan Contras. They created the Contadora support group, to support the Contadora group from South America. <b>Both</b> <b>groups</b> negotiated together, but ultimately failed because of the reluctance of both Nicaragua and the United States to change their positions. The group changed its scope later to discuss foreign debt and diplomacy with the United Kingdom in relation to the Falklands conflict.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon has a {{high level}} of {{religious}} freedom and diversity. The predominant faith is Christianity, practiced by about two-thirds of the population, while Islam is a significant minority faith, adhered to by about one-fifth. In addition, traditional faiths are practiced by many. Muslims are most concentrated in the north, while Christians are concentrated primarily in the southern and western regions, but practitioners of both faiths can be found throughout the country. Large cities have significant populations of <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> Muslims in Cameroon are divided into Sunnis (including Wahhabis), Shias, Sufis, and non-denominational Muslims.|$|E
5|$|Culturally the Betsimisaraka can {{be divided}} into {{northern}} and southern sub-groups. Many elements of culture are common across <b>both</b> <b>groups,</b> including respect for ancestors, spirit possession, the ritual sacrifice of zebu, and a patriarchal social structure. The groups are distinguished by linguistic sub-dialects and various fady (taboos), as well as certain funeral practices and other customs. The Betsimisaraka practice famadihana (reburial) and sambatra (circumcision) and believe in sorcery and a wide range of supernatural forces. Many taboos and folktales revolve around lemurs and crocodiles, both of which are common throughout Betsimisaraka territory.|$|E

5|$|Experts {{disagree}} {{over whether}} temnospondyls were ancestral to modern amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians), {{or whether the}} whole group died out without leaving any descendants. Different hypotheses have placed modern amphibians as the descendants of temnospondyls, another group of early tetrapods called lepospondyls, or even as descendants of <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> (with caecilians evolving from lepospondyls and frogs and salamanders evolving from temnospondyls). Recent studies place a family of temnospondyls called the amphibamids as the closest relatives of modern amphibians. Similarities in teeth, skulls, and hearing structures link the two groups.|$|E
5|$|Group 13 and Group 15 {{are located}} {{just outside the}} {{protected}} archaeological zone, opposite the custodian's house. Group 15 is situated immediately north of Group 13 and some structures are shared by <b>both</b> <b>groups.</b> Ceramic fragments recovered from the two groups have been dated to the Late Preclassic, Late Classic, Terminal Classic and Postclassic, with the majority dating to the Terminal Classic.|$|E
5|$|Humans likely first {{inhabited}} the South Florida region 10,000 to 20,000years ago. Two tribes of Native Americans developed on the peninsula's southern tip: the Tequesta {{lived on the}} eastern side and the Calusa, greater in numbers, on the western side. The Everglades served as a natural boundary between them. The Tequesta lived in a single large community near the mouth of the Miami River, while the Calusa lived in 30villages. <b>Both</b> <b>groups</b> traveled through the Everglades, but rarely lived within them, remaining mostly along the coast.|$|E

5|$|In 1986, Richard Morris {{provided}} {{some of the}} first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories in vivo. He tested the spatial memory of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. <b>Both</b> <b>groups</b> were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from <b>both</b> <b>groups,</b> LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{researchers}} at the University of Michigan studied the effect of combining video clips of Sesame Street and related print materials, online activities, and teacher training and mentoring on learning.

5|$|In March 2007, the FDA {{reported}} {{the results of}} a randomized, open-label, phase III clinical trial comparing linezolid to vancomycin in the treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infections. Patients treated with vancomycin could be switched to oxacillin or dicloxacillin if the bacteria that caused their infection was found to be susceptible, and patients in <b>both</b> <b>groups</b> (linezolid and vancomycin) could receive specific treatment against Gram-negative bacteria if necessary. The study itself was published in January 2009.|$|E
