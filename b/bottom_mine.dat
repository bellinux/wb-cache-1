500|$|The {{cause of}} the {{explosion}} is still unclear. The officially named cause, regarded as the most probable, was a magnetic RMH or LMB <b>bottom</b> <b>mine,</b> laid by the Germans during World War II and triggered by the dragging of the battleship's anchor chain before [...] for the last time. Subsequent searches located 32 mines of these types, some of them within [...] of the explosion. The damage was consistent with an explosion of [...] of TNT {{and more than one}} mine may have detonated. Nonetheless, other explanations for the ship's loss have been proposed and the most popular of these is that she was sunk by Italian frogmen of the wartime special operations unit Decima Flottiglia MAS who — more than ten years after the cessation of hostilities — were either avenging the transfer of the former Italian battleship to the USSR or sinking it on behalf of NATO. Novorossiysk was stricken from the naval register on 24 February 1956, salvaged on 4 May 1957, and subsequently scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The Training-1 (Chinese: 训-1, Transliterated: Xun-1) {{training}} <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> is {{a training}} naval mine developed by Fengxi Machinery Factory (Chinese: 汾西机器厂) in China, and was accepted into service in November 1982. The Training-1 mine {{could be used}} to train for every <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> in the Chinese inventory, as well as for minesweeping training. When the training is completed, a high pressure gas valve is released, and the training <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> would float to the surface for recovery.|$|E
5000|$|The Sinking-5 (Chen-5) is a Chinese naval mine. It {{is a small}} <b>bottom</b> <b>mine,</b> {{like the}} Chen-4 and Drifting-2 {{drifting}} mine it was designed around the concept of People’s War of guerrilla warfare. It can be dismantled for easy transportation and reassembled just prior to being planted. Unlike the Sinking-4 (Chen-4) <b>bottom</b> <b>mine,</b> this <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> cannot be used as part of other Chinese naval mine systems, {{but it does have}} the ability to incorporate the contact fuse, a feat that the Sinking (Chen-4) <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> lacks. Furthermore, Sinking-5 (Chen-5) <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> is developed by Fengxi Machinery Factory (汾西机器厂) can also be used on land as part of booby traps. The evaluation of this mine was carried out under combat conditions - these mines were deployed in Cambodia and Vietnam during the Vietnam War and the customers were satisfied with the performance, and as a result, the mine was considered an achievement and won a national award in 1978.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bottom</b> <b>mines</b> {{are used}} {{when the water}} {{is no more than}} 60 m deep or when mining for {{submarines}} down to around 200 m. They are much harder to detect and sweep, and can carry a much larger warhead than a moored <b>mine.</b> <b>Bottom</b> <b>mines</b> commonly utilize multiple types of sensors, which are less sensitive to sweeping.|$|R
50|$|The {{distance}} sweep {{mimics the}} sound and magnetism of a ship and is pulled behind the sweeper. It has floating coils and large underwater drums. It is the only sweep effective against <b>bottom</b> <b>mines.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Styrsö class ships {{have very}} good {{manoeuvring}} properties and are used for hunting <b>bottom</b> <b>mines,</b> traditional mine sweeping and operates in coastal waters. They carry underwater ROVs of the type Uven and are prepared {{for the next generation}} of rovs called ROV S.|$|R

50|$|The Chen-4 or Sinking-4 (沉-4, or Chen-4) is a <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> with {{non-contact}} fuses. It was jointly {{developed by}} the 710th Research Institute of Chinese Shipbuilding and the Dongfeng Instrument Factory (东风仪表厂). This <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> is the counterpart of the Drifting-2 drifting mine and like the latter, it can be disassembled for easy transportation and then reassembled prior to being deployed. A mine with negative buoyancy which remains on the seabed. Also called a ground mine.|$|E
50|$|Type 500 {{training}} mine was jointly developed by Fengxi Machinery Factory (汾西机器厂) and the First Division of the People’s Liberation Army Naval Air Force. This {{training mine}} {{is very similar}} to the Training-1 training <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> except that Type 500 training mine can be planted by aircraft. It is used to train pilots to drop mines into the ocean. Like the Training-1 training <b>bottom</b> <b>mine,</b> this mine can also be rapidly converted into live round by adopting warheads on regular mines.|$|E
50|$|The Osprey {{class are}} {{a series of}} coastal minehunters {{designed}} to find, classify, and destroy moored and <b>bottom</b> naval <b>mines</b> from vital waterways. They use sonar and video systems, cable cutters and a mine detonating device that can be released and detonated by remote control. The Osprey class are the worlds second largest minehunters (surpassed by the Royal Navys 60 m s) to be constructed entirely of fiberglass and designed to survive the shock of underwater explosions. Their primary mission is reconnaissance, classification, and neutralization of all types of moored and <b>bottom</b> <b>mines</b> in littoral areas, harbors and coastal waterways.|$|R
50|$|Aggressive class minesweepers used AN/SQQ-14 {{mine hunting}} sonar to locate moored or <b>bottom</b> <b>mines.</b> They used {{electromagnetic}} cables {{to set off}} mines or other cables to cut their mooring lines, and various magnetic and acoustical devices to set off mines. Toward {{the end of their}} use, the class also employed remote submersibles like Super Sea Rover to locate mines.|$|R
50|$|The Sund-class minesweepers {{were built}} of wood, bronze and other {{non-magnetic}} materials. They swept mine fields by trawling {{through the area}} with paravanes on tow separating magnetic and acoustic generators for the <b>bottom</b> <b>mines,</b> and chain cutters for the horned mines. The Flyvefisken class is a minehunter and locates the mines with side-scan sonar and neutralizes {{them one by one}} with a ROV.|$|R
50|$|The Sinking-1 (沉-1, or Chen-1) {{naval mine}} {{is the fourth}} type of naval mine {{entering}} Chinese service in 1966. It is a <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> jointly developed by the 710th research institute, the 152nd Factory and Fengxi Machinery Factory (汾西机器厂), {{and it was the}} first Chinese naval mine utilizing an acoustic fuse.|$|E
50|$|Multiple {{anti-tank}} mines {{have been}} buried in stacks {{of two or}} three with the <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> fuzed, in order to multiply the penetrating power. Since the mines are buried, the ground directs the energy of the blast in a single direction — through the bottom of the target vehicle or on the track.|$|E
50|$|Rocket mine: a Russian invention, {{the rocket}} mine is a bottom {{distance}} mine that fires a homing high-speed rocket (not torpedo) upwards towards the target. It {{is intended to}} allow a <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> to attack surface ships as well as submarines from a greater depth. One type is the Te-1 rocket propelled mine.|$|E

50|$|Avenger-class {{ships are}} {{designed}} as mine hunter-killers capable of finding, classifying, and destroying moored and <b>bottom</b> <b>mines.</b> The last three MCM ships were purchased in 1990, {{bringing the total}} to 14 fully deployable, oceangoing Avenger-class ships. These ships use sonar and video systems, cable cutters and a mine-detonating device that can be released and detonated by remote control. They are also capable of conventional sweeping measures.|$|R
50|$|In {{the same}} summer of 1943 the {{icebreaker}} Joseph Stalin, recently refitted in Seattle, escorted three transports from the United States to Tiksi. Here, Litke awaited {{the arrival of}} this convoy which would double Joseph Stalins ice-breaking capacity. However, the threat of German submarines and <b>bottom</b> <b>mines</b> scattered in the shallow coastal passage caused a delay until the Navy could assemble an adequate defensive escort.|$|R
50|$|The Sinking-2 (Chinese: 沉-2, Transliteration: Chen-2) <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> was {{the first}} {{indigenous}} designed Chinese naval mine that could adopt a range of fuzes, such as acoustic, contact, infrasonic, ultrasonic and magnetic fuzes. The project was jointly developed by Fengxi Machinery Factory (Chinese: 汾西机器厂) and the 710th Research Institute in 1972, and was mainly used for coastal regions. The mine was accepted into service in 1975.|$|E
50|$|The ATF Dingo has a {{modular design}} with five elements: chassis, {{protection}} cell, storage space, engine compartment, and <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> blast deflector. Its design is lighter and includes an armored chassis with a blast pan {{instead of the}} more common monocoque hull found in modern blast resistant vehicles. IBD's layered MEXAS is used and the windows are angled to deflect blasts and bullets. A tarpaulin is used over the back storage area instead of metal to save weight.|$|E
50|$|The Sinking-3 (沉-3, or Chen-3) was is the {{successor}} of Sinking-2 (Chen-2) <b>bottom</b> <b>mine,</b> {{and it was}} jointly developed by the Vanguard Instrumentation Factory (前卫仪表厂) and Suzhou Maritime Machinery Factory (苏州船用机械厂) in 1974. In comparison to its processor, this mine {{is the first in}} the Chinese inventory to adopt combined fuses instead of being only able to have a single type of fuse. Currently, all Sinking-3 bottom mines are upgraded to the Sinking-3-II (Chen-3Yi) standard and this latest version is a fully solid state model. The upgrades were done by the Vanguard Instrumentation Factory.|$|E
50|$|Coastal minehunters are {{ships that}} are {{designed}} to find, classify, and destroy moored and <b>bottom</b> <b>mines</b> from vital waterways. Coastal minehunters are generally smaller and with lower sea-keeping and endurance than oceangoing minehunters. They are usually tasked with keeping fixed high-value choke points clear of mines, such as the approaches to military ports and harbours. In a Cold War context it was especially important to protect those ports used by a nation's ballistic missile submarines.|$|R
5|$|Because {{the class}} was {{designed}} with reconnaissance, small scale minelaying and special operations in mind, it does not possess any offensive weapons such as torpedoes. The submarine was to use its small dimensions to easily maneuver in the relatively shallow waters of the Adriatic sea, staying undetected and transporting up to six special forces personnel who had 612 limpet mines and four AIM-M70 (M70/1) <b>bottom</b> <b>mines</b> or four R-1 submersibles at their disposal. Velebit had a crew of four.|$|R
5|$|In {{accordance}} with their expected mission, the boats could transport up to six naval commandos armed with 612 M-66 or M-71 limpet mines. Also at their disposal were four large AIM-70/71 <b>bottom</b> <b>mines</b> mounted {{on the outside of}} the submarines. Four R-1 swimmer delivery vehicles could be carried in place of the AIM-70/71 mines. With a full crew of six members the boats had an underwater endurance of 160 hours which was reduced to 96 hours if the complement numbered ten personnel (four crew members and six naval commandos).|$|R

The upper diagram shows a pull-fuze screwed into a secondary fuze {{well in the}} side of the mine. Additionally, an M5 anti-lift device has been screwed into another fuze well, hidden under the mine. An inexperienced deminer might detect and render safe the pull-fuze, but then be killed when he lifted the mine, triggering the M5 pressure-release firing device underneath. The lower diagram shows two anti-tank landmines connected by a cord attached to the upper mine's carrying handle. The cord is attached to a pull fuze installed in a secondary fuze well in the <b>bottom</b> <b>mine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Mohrland was {{a company}} town {{throughout}} its history; the mine owners essentially ran the town. The company worked {{to make it}} a pleasant place to live, despite its location {{at the edge of the}} desert. The streets were lined with shade trees, and a small stream ran along the canyon <b>bottom.</b> <b>Mine</b> employees' benefits included medical services, as well as regularly scheduled dances, films, and other social events. Mohrland's company baseball team was particularly popular and successful. In the spring of 1915, as champions of the Carbon County league, they played an exhibition game at Price against the Chicago White Sox, drawing an audience of over 10,000, but losing by a score of 17 to 1.|$|E
50|$|Specialized-2 (特-2, or Te-2) is {{the second}} {{generation}} remotely controlled naval mines. The project was jointly developed by the Vanguard Instrumentation Factory (前卫仪表厂), Shanghai Electric Automation Research Institute, Shanghai Jiaotong University, and Naval Engineering Academy. There are three states: safety, armed, and detonation. The <b>bottom</b> <b>mine</b> can remain {{in any one of}} these three states, though most of time it remains in the safety state. Upon receiving the remote commands, the mine can be switched to any one of the three states. The minefield consisted of Specialized-2 bottom mines can thus be inactive when friendly force passes by while the activated when enemy is in the area. Currently, all Specialized-2 mines are upgraded to the Specialized-2-1 standard.|$|E
30|$|During the Gulf War of 1990 - 1991, free {{floating}} sea mines {{proved to be}} a real threat to shipping in the Persian Gulf. Normally, sea mines are stationary interdiction devices, acting as a deterrent to keep hostile ships from entering strategically important zones. Two types are prevalent: <b>bottom</b> <b>mines,</b> a nonbuoyant type equipped with electromagnetic and acoustic sensors capable of detecting and even identifying passing ships, and the simpler tethered mines, which float just below the sea surface, rely on contact detonators and are anchored to the seabed.|$|R

She also participated with Abdiel, Tarpon, Telemachus, and Vanquisher in the second operation to lay Sinker mines on 22 August 1918, in the North Sea off Flanders about 17 nautical miles (31 km) north of Zeebrugge, Belgium, supported by Royal Air Force aircraft which patrolled to prevent German aerial observation of the operation.|$|R
50|$|Surprise was {{essential}} to avoid comparatively simple anti-personnel explosive countermeasures previously used to discourage Italian frogmen in the Mediterranean. Experiments were conducted with underwater foxholes of concrete pipe with steel doors. Preliminary tests with dogs indicated these foxholes would reduce the effects of nearby explosions. Plans were made for larger reinforced concrete stations capable of sheltering six to eighteen men. These larger stations would have been manufactured ashore {{in a variety of}} shapes to avoid detection, and then sunk at depths of less than fifteen meters. The Fukuryu were part of a three-stage system of mines including an offshore row of <b>bottom</b> <b>mines</b> to be released by trip wires to float up under passing landing craft, and rows of stationary magnetic and contact-fuzed mines in shallow water closer to the beach.|$|R
