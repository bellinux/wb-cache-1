5|$|An outraged Licavoli has Greene's house <b>blown</b> <b>up,</b> but he survives. He then {{attempts}} to demote Nardi {{and take away}} his crew, {{only to have the}} latter join forces with Greene. Vowing to take over Cleveland together, Greene and Nardi start by organizing the murders of Licavoli’s associates, many of whom are <b>blown</b> <b>up.</b> Thirty-six car bombings occur during the summer of 1976, drawing national attention and humiliating Licavoli. After failing multiple times to kill Greene, Licavoli is forced to humbly ask Genovese boss Anthony Salerno to help him kill Nardi and Greene.|$|E

5000|$|A natural {{idea for}} {{improving}} singularities is to <b>blow</b> <b>up</b> {{the locus of}} the [...] "worst" [...] singular points.

However <b>blowing</b> <b>up</b> the origin reproduces the same singularity on one of the coordinate charts.

5|$|Belgium's {{strategic}} location {{meant that}} it constituted an important supply hub for the whole German army in Northern Europe and particularly northern France. Sabotage was therefore an important duty of the resistance. Following the Normandy landings in June 1944 on orders from the Allies, the Belgian resistance began to step up its sabotage against German supply lines across the country. Between June and September alone, 95 railroad bridges, 285 locomotives, 1,365 wagons and 17 tunnels were all <b>blown</b> <b>up</b> by the Belgian resistance. Telegraph lines were also cut and road bridges and canals used to transport material sabotaged. In one notable action, 600 German soldiers were killed when a railway bridge between La Gleize and Stoumont in the Ardennes was <b>blown</b> <b>up</b> by 40 members of the resistance, including the writer Herman Bodson. Indeed, more German troops were reportedly killed in Belgium in 1941 than in all of Occupied France. Through its sabotage activities alone, one resistance group, , required the Germans to expend between 20 and 25 million man-hours of labour on repairing damage done, including ten million in the night of 15–16 January 1944 alone.|$|E
