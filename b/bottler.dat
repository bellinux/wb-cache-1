5|$|In September 1981, {{both the}} {{franchising}} {{rights to the}} Grapico brand name and The Pepsi Bottling Group in Newnan, Georgia were acquired by Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi <b>bottler</b> founded in Birmingham, Alabama in 1901. Both Buffalo Rock and R.R. Rochell's businesses were located in Birmingham since the early 1900s. For example, in October 1940, R.R.

In 1918, Rochell's Grapico Bottling Works opened a bottling plant in Hattiesburg, Mississippi as a second Mississippi <b>bottler</b> and seller of Grapico.|$|E

25|$|The Coca-Cola Company, {{which is}} {{headquartered}} in Atlanta, Georgia, but incorporated in Wilmington, Delaware, is an American multinational beverage corporation, and manufacturer, retailer, and marketer of nonalcoholic beverage concentrates and syrups.

25|$|Norwich {{also has}} a long {{association}} with chocolate manufacture, primarily through the local firm of Caley's, which began as a manufacturer and <b>bottler</b> of mineral water and later diversified into making chocolate and Christmas crackers. The Caley's cracker-manufacturing business {{was taken over by}} Tom Smith in 1953, and the Norwich factory in Salhouse Road eventually closed in 1998. Caley's was acquired by Mackintosh in the 1930s, and merged with Rowntree's in 1969 to become Rowntree-Mackintosh. Finally, it was bought by Nestlé and closed in 1996, with all operations moving to York after an association of 120 years with Norwich. The demolished factory stood on the site of what is now the Chapelfield development. Caley's chocolate has since made a reappearance as a brand in the city, although it is no longer made in Norwich.|$|E
5000|$|The {{first step}} in <b>bottling</b> beer is depalletising, where the empty <b>bottles</b> are removed from the {{original}} pallet packaging delivered from the manufacturer, so that individual <b>bottles</b> may be handled. The <b>bottles</b> may then be rinsed with filtered water or air, and may have carbon dioxide injected into them in attempt to reduce the level of oxygen within the <b>bottle.</b> The <b>bottle</b> then enters a [...] "filler" [...] which fills the <b>bottle</b> with beer and may also inject {{a small amount of}} inert gas (usually carbon dioxide or nitrogen) on top of the beer to disperse the oxygen, as oxygen can ruin the quality of the product via oxidation. Finally, the <b>bottles</b> go through a [...] "capper", which applies a <b>bottle</b> cap, sealing the <b>bottle.</b> A few beers are <b>bottled</b> with a cork and cage.|$|R

500|$|Rochell {{received}} the federal trademark on Grapico in 1940, giving his Grapico Company of America {{the right to}} use the name [...] "Grapico" [...] everywhere in the United States. In 1955, Grapico Company of America attempted to expand its fruit-flavored brands with Orangico, a sister product to Grapico that included real orange juice. The orange juice-based Orangico did not sell well and the federal trademark eventually expired. In September 1981, both the franchising rights to the Grapico brand name and The Pepsi Bottling Group in Newnan, Georgia were acquired by Buffalo Rock, an independent Pepsi <b>bottler</b> based in Birmingham, Alabama. Buffalo Rock revived the Orangico trademark in 1999 for an artificially flavored orange drink and introduced Diet Grapico in 2005.

Radio Shack vice-president of marketing David Beckerman said, [...] "A celebrity draws attention to the product. Even if we had President Reagan on our ads, we wouldn't sell any more computers.

40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} re-washing recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as wine <b>bottling</b> depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse <b>bottle</b> streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. <b>Bottle</b> washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} <b>bottle</b> types, including beer <b>bottles,</b> wine <b>bottles,</b> or juice <b>bottles.</b> This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, <b>bottles</b> were manufactured to heavy specifications as returnables. Today, most glass containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. Wine <b>bottles</b> remain an exception. Wine <b>bottles</b> manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing wine <b>bottles</b> is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a wine <b>bottle</b> does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass <b>bottles</b> may lead to lighter weight wine <b>bottles</b> as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations for wine <b>bottle</b> washing facilities. Finally, wine <b>bottles</b> wholesale for 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer <b>bottles</b> cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible for wine <b>bottles.</b> The collection of <b>bottles</b> must be structured to maximize the recovery of usable containers.

40|$|The {{objective}} of these experiments {{was to provide}} benchmark data to validate calculational codes used in critically safety assessments of plant configurations. Arrays containing up {{to as many as}} sixteen three-liter <b>bottles</b> filled with plutonium nitrate were used in the experiments. A split-table device was used in the final assembly of the arrays. Ths planar arrays were reflected with close fitting plexiglas on each side and on the bottom but not the top surface. The experiments addressed a number of factors effecting criticality: the critical air gap between <b>bottles</b> in an array of fixed number of <b>bottles,</b> the number of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality if the <b>bottles</b> were touching, and the effect on critical array spacing and critical <b>bottle</b> number due to the insertion of an hydrogeneous substance into the air gap between <b>bottles.</b> Each <b>bottle</b> contained about 2. 4 l of Pu(NO{sub 3 }) {sub 4 } solution at a Pu concentration of 105 g Pu/l, with the {sup 240 }Pu content being 2. 9 wt% at a free acid molarity H{sup +} of 5. 1. After the initial series of experiments were performed with <b>bottles</b> separated by air gaps, plexiglas shells of varying thicknesses were placed around each <b>bottle</b> to investigate how moderation between <b>bottles</b> affects both the number of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality and the critical spacing between each <b>bottle.</b> The minimum of <b>bottles</b> required for criticality was found to be 10. 9 <b>bottles,</b> occurring for a square array with <b>bottles</b> in contact. As the <b>bottles</b> were spaced apart, the critical number increased. For sixteen <b>bottles</b> in a square array, the critical separation between surfaces in both x and y direction was 0. 96 cm. The addition of plexiglas around each <b>bottle</b> decreased the critical <b>bottle</b> number, compared to those separated in air, but the critical <b>bottle</b> number, even with interstitial plastic in place was always greater than 10. 9 <b>bottles.</b> The most reactive configuration was a tightly packed array of <b>bottles</b> with no intervening material...|$|R
