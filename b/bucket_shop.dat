5000|$|<b>Bucket</b> <b>shops</b> {{specializing in}} stocks and {{commodity}} futures appeared in the United States in the 1870s, corresponding to the innovation of stock tickers upon which they depended. [...] In 1889, the New York Stock Exchange addressed the [...] "ticker trouble" [...] (<b>bucket</b> <b>shops</b> operating on intraday stock price movements), and attempted to suppress <b>bucket</b> <b>shops</b> by disconnecting telegraphic stock tickers. This embargo instead proved a severe hindrance to the Exchange's wealthy local clients, {{as well as the}} Exchange's brokers in other cities across the country. It also had the surprising effect of favoring competing exchanges, and was abandoned within days.|$|R

50|$|The {{origin of}} the term <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> {{has nothing to do}} with {{financial}} markets, as the term originated from England in the 1820s. During the 1820s, street urchins drained beer kegs which were discarded from public houses. The street urchins would take the dregs to an abandoned shop and drink them. This practice became known as bucketing, and the location at which they drained the kegs became known as a <b>bucket</b> <b>shop.</b> The idea was transferred to illegal brokers because they too sought to profit from sources too small or too unreliable for legitimate brokers to handle. The term <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> came to apply to low-class pseudo stock brokerages that did not execute trades.|$|E
5000|$|The oldest {{example of}} a {{derivative}} in history {{is thought to be}} a contract transaction of olives, entered into by ancient Greek philosopher Thales, and attested to by Aristotle, who made a profit in the exchange.

5000|$|In heraldry, a [...] "bucket shop" [...] is {{a company}} that will sell a coat of arms {{associated}} with the customer's surname, regardless of whether the customer can actually claim a relation to the original armiger. <b>Bucket</b> <b>shops</b> may work from a database of surnames and shields sourced from manuscripts, armorials, and various journals.|$|R

50|$|Edwin Lefèvre, who is {{believed}} to have been writing on behalf of Jesse Lauriston Livermore, describes the operations of bucket shops in the 1890s in detail. The terms of trade were different for each <b>bucket</b> <b>shop,</b> but bucket shops typically catered to customers who traded on thin margins, even as low as 1%. Most bucket shops refused to make margin calls, so that if the stock price fell even momentarily to the limit of the client's margin, the client would lose his entire investment. The highly leveraged use of margins theoretically gave the speculators equally large upside potential. However, if a <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> held a large position on a stock, it might sell the stock on the real stock exchange, causing the price on the ticker tape to momentarily move down enough to wipe out its client's margins, and the <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> could take 100% of their investments. the term came to apply to other types of scams, some of which are still practiced. They were typically small store front operations that catered to the small investor, where speculators could bet on price fluctuations during market hours. However, no actual shares were bought or sold: all trading was between the <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> and its clients. The <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> made its profit from commissions, and also profited when share prices went against the client.|$|E
5000|$|... "Bucket shop" [...] is {{a defined}} term under the {{criminal}} law of many states in the United States that make {{it a crime to}} operate a <b>bucket</b> <b>shop.</b> Typically {{the criminal law}} definition refers to an operation in which the customer is sold what {{is supposed to be a}} derivative interest in a security or commodity future, but there is no transaction made on any exchange. The transaction goes [...] "in the bucket" [...] and is never executed. Because no trading of actual securities occurs, the customer is essentially betting against the <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> operator in a game based on abstract security prices. While trading in a legitimate exchange also provides a similar game or wagering aspect, the one distinctive characteristic of a <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> is the mimicry of trading securities when no actual securities are traded. The bucket shop's exchange is a fiction, which the parties agree to imagine as following the events occurring in a real exchange. Alternatively, the <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> operator [...] "literally 'plays the bank,' as in a gambling house, against the customer." ...|$|E

In 1901, C.A.T. took ownership of the Delmar Investment Company, which among its holdings included a <b>bucket</b> <b>shop.</b> In 1909, bucket shops were declared illegal by the Anti-Bucket Shop Act of Congress. In 1910, Tilles and his partners at the Delmar Investment Company were arrested in the Western Union <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> scandal. Federal agents raided Western Union and uncovered a secret and illegal telegraph and ticker service for bucket shops across the country. In 1911, Tilles was extradited to Washington D.C. to stand trial for illegally operating and conspiring to operate a <b>bucket</b> <b>shop</b> in St. Louis. On October 10, 1911, the case was dismissed in favor of Tilles' acquittal after the Anti-Bucket Shop Act was declared unconstitutional by Justice Wright of the district of Columbia Supreme Court.|$|E

50|$|They {{were made}} illegal {{after they were}} cited as a major {{contributor}} to the two stock market crashes in the early 1900s. The activity flourished until outlawed in the 1920s. In the United States, the traditional pseudo-brokerage <b>bucket</b> <b>shops</b> came under increasing legal assault in the early 1900s, and were effectively eliminated before the 1920s. Shortly after the failure of many brokerages on the Consolidated Stock Exchange in 1922, the New York assembly passed the Martin Act, which essentially banned bucketshops.|$|R
50|$|Another form of {{technical}} analysis used so far was via interpretation of stock market data contained in quotation boards, {{that in the}} times before electronic screens, were huge chalkboards located in the stock exchanges, with data of the main financial assets listed on exchanges for analysis of their movements. It was manually updated with chalk, with the updates regarding some of these data being transmitted to environments outside of exchanges (such as brokerage houses, <b>bucket</b> <b>shops,</b> etc.) via the aforementioned tape, telegraph, telephone and later telex.|$|R

5000|$|His first noted {{case was}} {{in the summer of}} 1893, when bucket shops were {{becoming}} a rampant problem in the city, as these [...] "bucket shops" [...] specializing in stocks and commodity futures, as the terms of trade were different for each <b>bucket</b> <b>shop.</b> But, bucket shops typically catered to customers who traded on thin margins, even as low as 1%. The problem being that most bucket shops refused to make margin calls, so that if the stock price fell even momentarily to the limit of the client's margin, the client would lose his entire investment.

5|$|The Panic of 1907 – {{also known}} as the 1907 Bankers' Panic or Knickerbocker Crisis – was a United States {{financial}} crisis that took place over a three-week period starting in mid-October, when the New York Stock Exchange fell almost 50% from its peak the previous year. Panic occurred, as this was during a time of economic recession, and there were numerous runs on banks and trust companies. The 1907 panic eventually spread throughout the nation when many state and local banks and businesses entered bankruptcy. Primary causes of the run included a retraction of market liquidity by a number of New York City banks and a loss of confidence among depositors, exacerbated by unregulated side bets at <b>bucket</b> <b>shops.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The {{regulation}} {{contains two}} key components: the [...] "locate" [...] and the [...] "close-out." [...] The locate component attempts to reduce failure to deliver securities by requiring a broker possess or have arranged to possess borrowed shares. The close out component requires that a broker {{be able to}} deliver the shares that are to be shorted. In the US, initial public offers (IPOs) cannot be sold short for a month after they start trading. This mechanism is in place to ensure a degree of price stability during a company's initial trading period. However, some brokerage firms that specialize in penny stocks (referred to colloquially as <b>bucket</b> <b>shops)</b> have used the lack of short selling during this month to pump and dump thinly traded IPOs. Canada and other countries do allow selling IPOs (including U.S. IPOs) short.|$|R

One of his first orders of business was the extermination of bucket shopss. Wagar was re-elected president in 1901 and 1902, while Lewis V.F. Randolph was president for 1903, 1904 and 1905. By 1904, <b>bucket</b> <b>shops</b> had become a point of contention among the voting members of the Consolidated Stock and Petroleum Exchange. Wagar remained strongly against their use, in opposition to the Exchange's governors. By 1907, total membership was approximately 1,300.|$|R
