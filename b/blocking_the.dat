5000|$|The {{blockers}} will penetrate {{their hands}} over the net in order to <b>block</b> <b>the</b> attack. If the coach angles towards the outside, the outside blocker and middle blocker will <b>block</b> <b>the</b> left side together. If the coach angles towards the middle, the middle blocker will <b>block.</b> <b>The</b> player could also put up a triple <b>block</b> (<b>the</b> middle blocker, outside blocker, and right side blocker all <b>block</b> <b>the</b> middle front attack together). If the coach angles towards the right side, the right side blocker and middle block will put up a double <b>block</b> on <b>the</b> {{right side of the}} net.|$|R

5|$|According to Stanley Karnow, the Pulitzer Prize-winning {{author of}} Vietnam: A History, the coup was ineffectively executed; {{although}} the rebels captured {{the headquarters of}} the Joint General Staff at Tan Son Nhut Air Base, they failed to follow the textbook tactics of <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> roads leading into Saigon. They also failed to disconnect phone lines into the palace, which allowed Diệm to call for aid from loyal units.|$|E
5|$|After {{integration}} into the RISC, siRNAs base-pair to their target mRNA and cleave it, thereby preventing it from {{being used as a}} translation template. Differently from siRNA, a miRNA-loaded RISC complex scans cytoplasmic mRNAs for potential complementarity. Instead of destructive cleavage (by Ago2), miRNAs rather target the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) regions of mRNAs where they typically bind with imperfect complementarity, thus <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> access of ribosomes for translation.|$|E
5000|$|The Penarth Site {{was divided}} into five parts, each built at {{different}} times: <b>the</b> Old <b>Block,</b> <b>the</b> Annexe, <b>the</b> New <b>Block,</b> <b>the</b> Terrapins, and <b>the</b> Science <b>Block.</b> <b>The</b> Penarth Site's 'New Block' (which housed the sciences, mathematics, geography, and the Sixth Form) {{was considered to be}} the highest vantage point in Penarth.|$|R

5|$|After {{several months}} of stalemate, Philip finally {{advanced}} into Boeotia {{in an attempt to}} march on Thebes and Athens. Opposing him, and <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> road near Chaeronea, was the allied Greek army, similar in size and occupying a strong position. Details of the ensuing battle are scarce, but after a long fight the Macedonians crushed both flanks of the allied line, which then dissolved into a rout.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the poor}} sound quality limits its {{commercial}} appeal, the album provides historic {{insight into the}} group's club act in the period after Ringo Starr joined but before the emergence of Beatlemania.

5|$|Foreign {{broadcast}} coverage, such as {{from the}} BBC and CNN, was blacked out whenever Liu was mentioned.

50|$|Slotoxin {{reversibly}} <b>blocks</b> <b>the</b> high conductance calcium-activated potassium channels {{composed of}} only α-subunits (Kd = 1.5 nM).

5000|$|Shotton Hall School {{was first}} opened in 1963 as a {{secondary}} modern school, but in 1973 {{it became a}} comprehensive school and it was extended with new buildings such as <b>the</b> B <b>block,</b> <b>the</b> Towers, Speed, Metcalfe and Nicholson house <b>blocks,</b> <b>the</b> music <b>block,</b> <b>the</b> art <b>block,</b> <b>the</b> music <b>block</b> and <b>the</b> sports hall.

5|$|Several {{proteins}} in the exosome are {{the target of}} autoantibodies in patients with specific autoimmune diseases (especially the PM/Scl overlap syndrome) and some antimetabolic chemotherapies for cancer function by <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> activity of the exosome. In addition, mutations in exosome component 3 cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia and spinal motor neuron disease.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56 also {{supports}} pivoting-door type thrust reversers. This type {{is used on}} the CFM56-5 engines that power many Airbus aircraft. They work by actuating a door that pivots down into the bypass duct, both <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> bypass air and deflecting the flow outward, creating the reverse thrust.|$|E

5|$|Thistle {{was almost}} {{completely}} destroyed. Most wooden buildings were carried {{away in the}} floodwaters.

Most remains were either naturally deposited or placed {{on the eastern shore}} of the lake.|$|E
5|$|Although {{aircraft}} {{flying over}} the Jisr ed Damieh to Beisan road, the Jisr ed Damieh bridge, Es Salt and Beisan as far as Tubas, reported all quiet at dawn {{on the morning of}} 20 September, RAF Bristol Fighters would later attack a convoy of 200 vehicles withdrawing from Nablus, <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> road, causing many horses to bolt over a precipice {{on one side of the}} road while men scattered into the hills on the other side. The last reconnaissance on 20 September reported the whole Ottoman line alarmed, three large fires were burning at Nablus railway station and at the Balata supply dumps, while a brigade of British cavalry was seen entering Beisan.|$|E
5|$|Building 28 (Structure 5D-28) is {{an unusual}} {{building}} {{at the top of}} an access stairway {{on the east side of}} the basal platform. It appears to have been a guardroom controlling access from the east terrace. The chamber originally contained curtained doorways and benches against the walls. The width of the building completely blocked access from the stairway; this forced visitors to pass through the chamber, where their presence could be scrutinised and passage beyond blocked if necessary. This route may have become important when Temple 33 was built, <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> main access stairway from the Great Plaza. Structure 5D-28 was built very late in the Early Classic period (around the 6th century).|$|E

The 60th Division held Tulkarm and Anebta, the 7th (Meerut) Division held the village of Beit Lid and controlled the crossroads at Deir Sheraf, while the 5th Light Horse Brigade had cut the Jenin railway south of Arrabe. Both the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) Divisions had continued to force the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies' retreat.|$|E
5|$|Caesar's policy {{aimed at}} {{controlling}} the territory {{west of the}} Jura and Rhine, {{as well as at}} <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> potential incursion routes from the East along the Jura. The Raetians, described as savage warriors by Strabo, continued to launch incursions into the Swiss Plateau and also had to be contained. To that end, Caesar charged the Helvetii and the Rauraci with defending their territory and established two colonies of veterans – one, the Colonia Julia Equestris (now Nyon) on the shores of Lake Geneva and the other through Lucius Munatius Plancus in northwestern Switzerland, preceding the larger Augusta Raurica founded by Augustus in around 6AD.|$|E
5|$|Cádiz {{had been}} {{invested}} by the French in early 1810, leaving it accessible from the sea, but in March {{of the following}} year {{a reduction in the}} besieging army gave its garrison of British and Spanish troops an opportunity to lift the siege. A large Allied strike force was shipped south from Cádiz to Tarifa, and moved to engage the siege lines from the rear. The French, under the command of Marshal Victor, were aware of the Allied movement and redeployed to prepare a trap. Victor placed one division on the road to Cádiz, <b>blocking</b> <b>the</b> Allied line of march, while his two remaining divisions fell on the single Anglo-Portuguese rearguard division under the command of Sir Thomas Graham.|$|E
