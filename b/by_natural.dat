5|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, Charles Darwin {{formulated}} the scientific {{theory of evolution}} <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> selection, published in his book On the Origin of Species (1859). Evolution <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> selection is a process demonstrated by the observation that more offspring are produced than can possibly survive, along with three facts about populations: 1) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology, physiology, and behaviour (phenotypic variation), 2) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction (differential fitness), and 3) traits can be passed {{from generation to generation}} (heritability of fitness). Thus, in successive generations members of a population are replaced by progeny of parents better adapted to survive and reproduce in the biophysical environment in which natural selection takes place.|$|E

5|$|National nature {{reserves}} in England (NNR) are designated under Part III of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949 that are {{deemed to be}} of national importance <b>by</b> <b>Natural</b> England as key places for wildlife and natural features in England using section 35(1) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. They were established to protect the most significant areas of habitat and of geological formations. NNRs are managed {{on behalf of the}} nation, many <b>by</b> <b>Natural</b> England themselves, but also by non-governmental organisations, including Avon Wildlife Trust or the Somerset Wildlife Trust, the National Trust, and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|Some {{grasshopper}} species, {{like the}} Chinese rice grasshopper, are a pest in rice paddies.

5|$|A fifth {{generating}} unit fueled <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> {{gas and oil}} {{was added to the}} Turkey Point generating station in 2007. In 2009, Turkey Point was proposed as the site of two new 1117MW AP1000 nuclear reactors, to be designated Turkey Point 6 and 7. If built, the new reactors would make Turkey Point one of the largest generating sites in the United States. Other neighboring influences on the bay are the agricultural lands of south Miami-Dade County, a sewage treatment facility on the park boundary at Black Point, and its neighbor, the South Miami-Dade Landfill.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{and plants}} {{have evolved to}} {{synthesise}} {{a vast array of}} poisonous products including secondary metabolites, peptides and proteins that can act as inhibitors. Natural toxins are usually small organic molecules and are so diverse that there are probably natural inhibitors for most metabolic processes. The metabolic processes targeted <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> poisons encompass more than enzymes in metabolic pathways and can also include the inhibition of receptor, channel and structural protein functions in a cell. For example, paclitaxel (taxol), an organic molecule found in the Pacific yew tree, binds tightly to tubulin dimers and inhibits their assembly into microtubules in the cytoskeleton.|$|E
5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by the imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E

5|$|At {{low tide}} {{extensive}} areas of mudflats (the Steart and the Berrow Flats) are exposed, providing important feeding and over-wintering grounds for waders (shorebirds). Invertebrate fauna including six nationally rare species and eighteen nationally scarce species {{can be found}} in the ditches and ponds around the shores. Consequently, Bridgwater Bay is a National Nature Reserve, and is managed <b>by</b> <b>Natural</b> England. Some of the potential risks to wildlife are highlighted in the local Oil Spill Contingency Plan.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{migration}} is the regular seasonal movement, often {{north and south}} along a flyway, between breeding and wintering grounds. Many species of bird migrate. Migration carries high costs in predation and mortality, including from hunting by humans, and is driven primarily by availability of food. It occurs mainly in the northern hemisphere, where birds are funnelled on to specific routes <b>by</b> <b>natural</b> barriers such as the Mediterranean Sea or the Caribbean Sea.|$|E

Wolves are major predators; a study found that old rutting bulls might be vulnerable to wolves. Cheetahs and pariah dogs are the other predators. Juveniles are also hunted by jackals. Village dogs are reported to kill fawns, but are unlikely to successfully hunt and kill adults.|$|E
