[...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E

For example, a student arrived at one of the five-day intensive seminars he held in his home office {{near the end of his}} life.

[...] Erickson smiled and said: [...] "You tell him that dying is the last thing I intend to do." [...] The group laughed at the pun. Then Erickson said, with a twinkle in his eye, [...] "Do you want to know how to avoid dying? Always wake up every morning.

In an interview with HitQuarters, Dr. Dre protege Focus... said, [...] "We did a song and an interlude together." [...] He produced the beats for the track [...] "Sex for Breakfast," [...] which were then worked on by Aguilera and producer Noel [...] "Detail" [...] Fisher. Focus... got involved with the project because he and Aguilera share a loyal, long-time engineer in Oscar Ramirez; Ramirez suggested and arranged the pairing. Of the experience Focus... commented, [...] " [...] knows exactly what she is looking for and {{is not afraid to}} tell you. It was the first project I've ever worked on where someone sent me examples and showed me exact parts in the song they were looking for." [...] Aguilera announced on her E! special {{that she was going to}} be working with American dance-punk band Le Tigre. Aguilera said in August 2009, that she co-wrote tracks with British Tamil songwriter M.I.A. and Santigold, and according to the producer Tricky Stewart, Flo Rida would be featured on the album.

Additionally Stewart and Claude Kelly wrote the song [...] "Glam", which was described as [...] "a hard club song that's about high fashion. It's really for the ladies about getting dressed and looking your best, working it in the club and getting glam and sexy <b>before</b> <b>you</b> <b>go</b> out. ... It will surprise people. I'm calling it a modern day [...] "Vogue." [...] I wouldn't say it unless I believed it." [...] Kelly also co-wrote three other tracks for the album, including the first two singles [...] "Not Myself Tonight" [...] and [...] "Woohoo". He described the four tracks as being [...] "up-tempo and fun, they're party anthems but at the same time have underlying messages." [...] Commenting on the experience of working with Aguilera, Kelly said, [...] "What people don't know about her is that she's actually a really good writer. She has good ideas, good melodies, good concepts ... She's really involved from the very beginning to the very end." ...|$|E
