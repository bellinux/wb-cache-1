5|$|Forests make {{up about}} , or 48 percent, of the province's land area. The forests consist of pines (Jack Pine, Red Pine, Eastern White Pine), spruces (White Spruce, Black Spruce), <b>Balsam</b> Fir, Tamarack (larch), poplars (Trembling Aspen, <b>Balsam</b> Poplar), birches (White Birch, Swamp Birch) and small pockets of Eastern White Cedar.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the animals}} in the spruce-fir forest have ranges that extend into the <b>balsam</b> fir forest higher up. Warblers are abundant; more than ten species exist in this forest type. Other common birds include brown-capped chickadees, spruce grouse, and yellow-capped woodpeckers. Mammals include the red {{squirrel}} and the pine marten.|$|E
5|$|The three {{principal}} kingdoms of Cuscatlan, Izalco, and Chaparrastique {{engaged in}} regular warfare, and smaller groups occasionally rebelled against their larger neighbours. There was flourishing trade, with cacao {{as the principal}} commodity, although maize, cotton, and <b>balsam</b> were also traded.|$|E

5|$|The {{tradition}} {{of having a}} National Christmas Tree in Washington, D.C. began in 1923 when a 48-foot <b>Balsam</b> Fir from Vermont {{was placed in the}} Ellipse outside the White House. On Christmas Eve, President Calvin Coolidge lit the 2,500 red, white and green electric bulbs on the tree.|$|E
5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of <b>balsam</b> fir. Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped from the soil and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Coniferous trees such {{as black}} spruce, white spruce, and <b>balsam</b> fir {{dominate}} the native vegetation. The largest deciduous tree is white birch; species of lesser stature include alder, cherry and mountain ash. Of introduced tree species, sycamore maple is most abundant and Norway maple is common. Blue spruce, common horsechestnut, European beech and littleleaf linden {{are among the}} other non-native species grown.|$|E

She gives Gurnemanz a vial of <b>balsam,</b> brought from Arabia, to ease the King's pain and then collapses, exhausted.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under <b>balsam</b> fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its hymenium was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|Resin is {{gathered}} by tapping trees including silver-fir and Aleppo pine; the best resin {{is from the}} terebinth. On Mount Ida in Crete the people gather pitch from Corsican pine and Aleppo pine. Gums such as frankincense, myrrh and <b>balsam</b> of Mecca are gathered either by cutting the plant or naturally. Frankincense and myrrh are gathered into the closely guarded temple of the Sabaeans. Cassia and cinnamon also come from the Arabian peninsula.|$|E

5|$|The {{decline in}} C. graminis {{is likely to}} be due to habitat loss {{resulting}} from land improvement and arable conversion, over-grazing, development, drainage and lowering of water-tables due to over-abstraction. Neglect may also lead to loss or degradation of habitat such as through over-shading or competition of food-plants with invasive species such as Himalayan <b>balsam</b> (Impatiens glandulifera). Flood-bank works may deplete or destroy local sub-populations.|$|E
5|$|Past Phoenicia, the {{surrounding}} slopes become steeper {{as the road}} and creek curve around Panther Mountain, one of the Catskill High Peaks, to the south. At Allaben, the Shandaken Tunnel crosses under the road, bringing water from Schoharie Reservoir into the creek. The road and creek start bending to the south to the hamlet of Shandaken, where the town hall {{on the south side}} of the road is followed by the southern terminus of NY42's northern segment. As NY28 continues trending southwest, the valley becomes less developed. <b>Balsam</b> Mountain, another High Peak, looms ahead.|$|E
5|$|Southern Labrador {{is mostly}} taiga. It is {{characterized}} by low winter temperatures, a longer growing season, and more precipitation than the tundra. Soils are typically lacking important nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. The taiga is dominated by coniferous trees, notably <b>balsam</b> fir and black spruce, though the deciduous white birch, trembling aspen and mountain ash are also present. The most common animals are the moose, American black bear, Canada lynx, red fox, pine marten, short-tailed weasel, and American mink. Beavers, muskrats, and river otters thrive in the many rivers, streams, and wetlands. Willow ptarmigan, common raven, and blackpoll warbler inhabit the forests of southern Labrador while golden eagles, rough-legged hawks and peregrine falcons nest on steep cliffs.|$|E
50|$|Some resins when soft {{are known}} as 'oleoresins', and when {{containing}} benzoic acid or cinnamic acid they are called <b>balsams.</b> Oleoresins are naturally occurring mixtures of an oil and a resin; they can be extracted from various plants. Other resinous products in their natural condition are a mix with gum or mucilaginous substances and known as gum resins. Several natural resins are used as ingredients in perfumes, e.g., <b>balsams</b> of Peru and tolu, elemi, styrax, and certain turpentines.|$|R

50|$|In 2002, it was rediscovered by Tarun Chhabra {{and other}} {{researchers}} of the Edhkwehlynawd Botanical Refuge (EBR) of Udhagamandalam (Ootacamund). This team noticed that several native species of wild <b>balsams</b> were seldom seen in the field. For three years of ongoing botanical studies they made field trips during each August-September period when the <b>balsams</b> are in bloom. They sighted the I. denisonii only during their third year of searching. This was the first scientific collection of the species since British naturalist Richard Henry Beddome first documented it in 1862.|$|R
5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not <b>balsam</b> (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|E
5|$|The highway curves {{northeast}} to {{pass through}} the communities of Feronia and later Redbridge and <b>Balsam</b> Creek, after which it enters thick wilderness dominated by the Canadian Shield and Boreal Forest, with few residences or services outside of communities. It meanders northward, meeting the northern end of Highway533, which travels south to Mattawa, approximately two-thirds of the distance between North Bay and the Quebec border. For the remainder of the highway, the route passes through isolated forests, travelling north, then curving east towards the Ottawa River. It passes through the community of Eldee before turning north alongside the river, following it up through Thorne. North of Thorne, the highway turns east and crosses the river into Quebec, becoming Route101 and entering Témiscaming.|$|E
5|$|The Catholic Church {{sees the}} sacrament of {{confirmation}} as required to complete the grace given in baptism. When adults are baptised, confirmation is normally given immediately afterwards, a practice followed even with newly baptised infants in the Eastern Catholic Churches. In the West confirmation of children is delayed until they {{are old enough to}} understand or at the bishop's discretion. In Western Christianity, particularly Catholicism, the sacrament is called confirmation, because it confirms and strengthens the grace of baptism; in the Eastern Churches, it is called chrismation, because the essential rite is the anointing of the person with chrism, a mixture of olive oil and some perfumed substance, usually <b>balsam,</b> blessed by a bishop. Those who receive confirmation must be in a state of grace, which for those who have reached the age of reason means that they should first be cleansed spiritually by {{the sacrament of}} Penance; they should also have the intention of receiving the sacrament, and be prepared to show in their lives that they are Christians.|$|E

5|$|The {{species is}} {{formally}} designated as 'Nationally Rare' in the United Kingdom and categorised as a 'Species of Principal Importance' {{in accordance with}} the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006. The Tansy Beetle Action Group was set up in 2008 to initiate and oversee conservation efforts and comprises representatives from the University of York, North Yorkshire County Council, City of York Council, Environment Agency and the National Trust. A recovery programme started, involving annual surveys of both tansy and beetles, control of tree shading and invasive plants that compete with tansy, such as Himalayan <b>balsam,</b> and limited re-introductions within the current species range. New clumps of tansy have been planted, particularly between isolated existing patches which may be beyond the 200m walking range of the beetle. In order to publicise the conservation project Rachael Maskell, the Member of Parliament for the constituency of York Central became a 'Tansy Beetle Species Champion' in 2016. That same year, a team of 30 volunteers surveyed a 90km stretch of the banks of the River Ouse. The surveying has identified an upward trend in population numbers, rising over 60% between 2015 and 2016 to 40,000 individuals.|$|E
