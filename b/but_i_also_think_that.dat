It's a mistake to see the final photo as evidence that the events of the film are predetermined: Jack has any number of moments where he can act other than the way he does, and that his (poor) choices are fueled by weakness and fear perhaps merely speaks all the more to the questions about the personal and the political that The Shining brings up.

[...] Dahlquist's argument is that Delbert Grady, the 1920s butler, and Charles Grady, the 1970s caretaker, rather than being either two different people or the same are two 'manifestations' of a similar entity; a part permanently at the hotel (Delbert) and the part which is given the choice of whether to join the legacy of the hotel's murderous past (Charles), just as the man in the photo is not exactly Jack Torrance, but nor is he someone entirely different. Jack in the photo has 'always' been at the Overlook, Jack the caretaker chooses to become part of the hotel.

40|$|In our {{brave new}} world of stem cells, clones, and parthenotes, how should we talk about early human embryos? In {{fashioning}} a response to this very thorny question, Ann Kiessling has a core message. It is: (1) that new science produces 2 ̆ 2 new 2 ̆ 2 conceptuses;(2) that science and scientists have failed to differentiate (with appropriate clarity) these new ex vivo conceptuses from those createdin vivo; (3) that new, more appropriate and scientifically-informed, terms are necessary; and (4) that this new language should transform the public discourse about human embryos. No one would deny that the subtleties of human embryology are neglected in public debate. This alone should compel scientists to choose terms that make scientific sense and to provide clear definitions. Dr. Kiessling has accepted well that challenge. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Kiessling is up to something else in her essay. She is attempting to reposition science, to gain for it a more influential voice in the heated politics of embryonic discourse. It is this point of concern that I shall address. Invoking the scientific reality of early human development does not, in itself, illuminate the choices to be made about early embryos. Yet good science must challenge policies founded on erroneous assumptions about the nature, character, and moral standing of human embryos. And Kiessling is using good biological evidence to make her case for three terminological choices: For human eggs fertilized with sperm, implantation is 2 ̆ 2 a more accurate requirement for embryo status; 2 ̆ 2 following that definition, nuclear transplants and parthenotes should not be called 2 ̆ 2 embryos. 2 ̆ 2 I shall comment on each...|$|E

40|$|From time to time, I am {{approached}} by young {{students who are}} considering a career in statistics and who ask “What are the open problems in sta-tistics? ” While I’m often tempted to respond that “we don’t {{tend to think that}} way in statistics,” the nature of the question tends to imply a stu-dent with mathematical training of the kind that I usually look for in a prospective student, and so I do my best to give a thoughtful response and cast our activities in terms of “open problems. ” This scenario came to my mind as I sat down to contemplate writing this column. It had alrea-dy occurred to me that one of the consolations of being President of ISBA (or President of any society) is that one can ask others to do the actu-al work that’s attributed to the President of the society. It was but a short step to realize that this might also apply to the writing of my column. In-deed, inspired by the notion of “crowd-sourcing” that is all the rage, I realized that as ISBA Presi-dent I had been given an unparalleled opportu-nity for “statistician-sourcing. ” People might re-spond to the ISBA President in ways that they might not respond to humble old me. And so I thought that I would seize the opportunity, as-semble a distinguished panel of statisticians and see what their views on the “open problems of statistics ” might be. I imagined that this might be of interest beyond my recruiting scenario. My pollingmethodology is rather open to criti-que, I am afraid. In particular, the individuals as-sembled are a highly non-random sample—they are a set of people who have the misfortune of being in the intersection of two sets: (a) highly-respected senior statisticians and (b) entries in my email address book. The question that I asked was “What do you view as the top two or three open problems in Bayesian statistics? ” The focus on Bayes is due to the ISBA context of course, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> frequentist statisticians aremore accustomed to thinking in terms of “open problems, ” and I wanted to make the question challenging (given that I didn’t have to answer it myself).

40|$|My task is {{to address}} the {{question}} of how the scientific community views the public understanding of science and whether {{there needs to be a}} re-conceptualization of the challenge to foster the public understanding of science, and also whether there is a need to re-examine assumptions. I am compelled to begin by acknowledging a debt to an important book, Inarticulate Science, written by Edgar Jenkins and his colleagues at Leeds. Inarticulate Science is an outstanding contribution on the concept of the public understanding of science and I think of my contribution today on this topic as a footnote. My perspective is somewhat different in that I have school settings in mind rather than adult learning (also see Lewenstein, 1992). I want {{to address the question}} of how the science community should think about the public understanding of science with respect to what happens in schools; and by school I mean K- 12 school plus the undergraduate science education of non science university majors. Also, I make my remarks from a cultural perspective in that I think it is important to think about how scientific ideas contribute to and influence the worldviews we construct for ourselves. Specifically, I am interested in science as an aspect of different systems of meaning that people construct for making sense of their worlds: 2 ̆ 2 An aspect 2 ̆ 2 of meaning because science is not the entire ball game except for a few people who chose to elevate science to the level of metaphysics; 2 ̆ 2 different systems 2 ̆ 2 because even among scientists there are differences as to how science is used in the construction of meaning. I also want to preface my remarks by noting that I am of course speaking from my experiences as an American science educator. What is happening in the USA, however, does not appear to be unique (see Gaskell, 1996; Sjøberg, 1996). For example, several industrial nations including Norway are involved in the Third International Mathematics and Science Study (National Research Council, 1996) for what appear to be the same reasons. UNESCO is promoting Project 2000 + which has a parallel form in the USA. The slogan 2 ̆ 2 Science for All 2 ̆ 2 can be heard worldwide; <b>but,</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> given the enormous size of the American scientific and education establishments along with publishing interests that what happens in the USA can hardly go unnoticed or unfelt. Nonetheless I will be at pains not to appear overly Yankee-centric. The structure of my remarks will be as follows. I begin with a celebration of science but then move on to discuss what concerns the scientific community has about the public. From here I address the key problematic element within the scientific community itself, the epistemology of scientific positivism. This epistemology creates considerable difficulties for the community of science within the public square. Finally, I begin with the end. Let me say at the onset where I am headed. Yes, the science community does need to re conceptualize the challenge and re-examine its assumptions about the public understanding of science. The science community 2 ̆ 7 s historic perspective on the public is grounded in the legitimate interests of science; but, the promotion of the public understanding of science needs to be grounded in the public 2 ̆ 7 s legitimate interests in science. The distinction between the prepositions 2 ̆ 2 of 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 in 2 ̆ 2 is crucial and I owe this insight to physicist Martin Eger (1989). Eger 2 ̆ 7 s distinction is similar to Ziman 2 ̆ 7 s (1984, 1991, 1992) science insiders and outsiders, which was also adopted by Jenkins (1992) and Layton et al (1993) ...|$|E
40|$|Egalitarians {{must address}} two questions: i. What {{should there be}} an {{equality}} of, which concerns the currency of the ‘equalisandum’; and ii. How should this thing be allocated to achieve the so-called equal distribution? A plausible initial composite answer to these two questions is that resources should be allocated in accordance with choice, because this way the resulting distribution of the said equalisandum will ‘track responsibility’ — responsibility will be tracked {{in the sense that}} only we will be responsible for the resources that are available to us, since our allocation of resources will be a consequence of our own choices. But the effects of actual choices should not be preserved until the prior effects of luck in constitution and circumstance are first eliminated. For instance, people can choose badly because their choice-making capacity was compromised {{due to a lack of}} intelligence (i. e. due to constitutional bad luck), or because only bad options were open to them (i. e. due to circumstantial bad luck), and under such conditions we are not responsible for our choices. So perhaps a better composite answer to our two questions (from the perspective of tracking responsibility) might be that resources should be allocated so as to reflect people’s choices, but only once those choices have been corrected for the distorting effects of constitutional and circumstantial luck, and on this account choice preservation and luck elimination are two complementary aims of the egalitarian ideal. Nevertheless, it is one thing to say that luck’s effects should be eliminated, but quite another to figure out just how much resource redistribution would be required to achieve this outcome, and so it was precisely for this purpose that in 1981 Ronald Dworkin developed the ingenuous hypothetical insurance market argumentative device (HIMAD), which he then used in conjunction with the talent slavery (TS) argument, to arrive at an estimate of the amount of redistribution that would be required to reduce the extent of luck’s effects. However recently Daniel Markovits has cast doubt over Dworkin’s estimates of the amount of redistribution that would be required, by pointing out flaws with his understanding of how the hypothetical insurance market would function. Nevertheless, Markovits patched it up and he used this patched-up version of Dworkin’s HIMAD together with his own version of the TS argument to reach his own conservative estimate of how much redistribution there ought to be in an egalitarian society. Notably though, on Markovits’ account once the HIMAD is patched-up and properly understood, the TS argument will also allegedly show that the two aims of egalitarianism are not necessarily complementary, but rather that they can actually compete with one another. According to his own ‘equal-agent’ egalitarian theory, the aim of choice preservation is more important than the aim of luck elimination, and so he alleges that when the latter aim comes into conflict with the former aim then the latter will need to be sacrificed to ensure that people are not subordinated to one another as agents. I believe that Markovits’ critique of Dworkin is spot on, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> his own positive thesis — and hence his conclusion about how much redistribution there ought to be in an egalitarian society — is flawed. Hence, this paper will begin in Section I by explaining how Dworkin uses the HIMAD and his TS argument to estimate the amount of redistribution that there ought to be in an egalitarian society — this section will be largely expository in content. Markovits’ critique of Dworkin will then be outlined in Section II, as will be his own positive thesis. My critique of Markovits, and my own positive thesis, will then make a fleeting appearance in Section III. Finally, I will conclude by rejecting both Dworkin’s and Markovits’ estimates of the amount of redistribution that there ought to be in an egalitarian society, and by reaffirming the responsibility-tracking egalitarian claim that choice preservation and luck elimination are complementary and not competing egalitarian aims...|$|E

Daringly billed as a 'family game,' this peculiar fusion of turn-based action and strategy, augmented by a deck of real playing cards, received a polite but puzzled critical reception, and was carefully ignored by everybody else." ...|$|R

[...] Milo is inspired by Corinne Bailey Ray and Amy Winehouse and the way they convey their emotions.Rainy was influenced by producer and singer Pharrell and cites in use of a mixture of genres as a major influence praising his ability to mix [...] "rock with psychedelic-sounding stuff and R&B".|$|R

In Le Mythe, dualism becomes a paradox: we value our own lives in spite of our mortality {{and in spite of}} the universe's silence. While we can live with a dualism (I can accept periods of unhappiness, because I know <b>I</b> will <b>also</b> experience happiness to come), we cannot live with the paradox (I think my life is of great importance, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> it is meaningless). In Le Mythe, Camus investigates our experience of the Absurd and asks how we live with it. Our life must have meaning for us to value it. If we accept that life has no meaning and therefore no value, should we kill ourselves? ...|$|R

He is intrinsically funny. He is also very good-natured and always means well, which I'm sure appeals to the audience." [...] He also believed {{he was going to}} become [...] "public enemy number one" [...] following the storyline of Isaac getting Luke kidnapped. Urquhart further elaborated on the characters popularity and 'cult following', saying: [...] "I think he's someone who's a little out of the box, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>think</b> he's got a heart of gold and people connect with his earnestness". The storyline that saw Luke romance Zlata (Kate Elliott) was labelled as [...] "shocking", due to the speed to which the characters fell in love. In 2012 Luke was named as one of the standout characters of the show's first 20 years. The soaps longest running actor, Michael Galvin (Chris Warner), named Luke as his favourite character.|$|R
