25|$|Since {{portions}} of northern New Spain {{became part of}} the United States' Southwest region, there has been considerable scholarship on the Spanish borderlands in the north. The motor of the Spanish colonial economy was the extraction of silver. In Bolivia, it was from the single rich mountain of Potosí; <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Spain, there were two major mining sites, one in Zacatecas, the other in Guanajuato.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, New Jersey {{became the}} first state to repeal the death penalty by {{legislative}} vote since Gregg v. Georgia, followed by New Mexico in 2009, Illinois in 2011, Connecticut in 2012, and Maryland in 2013. The repeals were not retroactive, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Jersey, Illinois and Maryland, governors commuted all death sentences after enacting the new law. In Connecticut, the Connecticut Supreme Court ruled in 2015 that the repeal must be retroactive. New Mexico is the only state with remaining death row inmates and no present death penalty statute.|$|E

25|$|General Douglas MacArthur had {{repeatedly}} requested Washington D.C. {{to send him}} additional troops with which to initiate an offensive campaign and had been pointedly told {{he would have to}} make do with the troops on hand. MacArthur had decided as soon as he had reached Australia that the key to its defense lay not on the mainland <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Guinea. On 13 September 1942 he ordered parts of the 32nd Division to Papua New Guinea even though they had less than two months of training. This would become part of the opening ground offensive against Japanese troops in the Southwest Pacific Area, and MacArthur expected the Americans to quickly and easily advance on and capture the Japanese forward base at Buna.|$|E
500|$|Banksia marginata {{is found}} from Baradine and Gibraltar Range National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales, southwards into Victoria and South Australia, {{as well as}} across Tasmania. It is found on the major islands of Bass Strait, including King, Flinders and Cape Barren Islands. There is one report of a collection from the Springbrook Mountains southwest of Southport in southeastern Queensland. It is extremely rare in southwestern New South Wales. In Victoria, it is predominantly coastal or near-coastal east of Traralgon, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> South Wales it is absent from coastal areas in the Sydney region. Banksia marginata often grew as a large tree on the basalt plains west of Melbourne, but has almost disappeared. In the vicinity of Adelaide, it was common in the western suburbs on old sand dunes behind the beach foredunes. It remains common in the Adelaide foothills. The annual rainfall over its distribution ranges from [...]|$|E
500|$|In general, bricks {{were not}} {{imported}} to the American colonies. Probably none were imported to Virginia and Maryland, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> England {{there was one}} possible example in New Haven, and there are records documenting the shipment of 10,000 bricks to Massachusetts Bay in 1628 and several thousand bricks being shipped to New Sweden. It {{is possible that the}} terms [...] "Dutch brick" [...] and [...] "English brick" [...] referred {{to the size of the}} locally-made bricks, with the Dutch bricks being the smaller. However, in New Netherland there are records of brick being imported from the Netherlands as ballast in 1633, and of continued shipments until the American Revolution (1765–1783). Bricks were being burned in New Amsterdam (New York) by 1628, but the imported bricks were of better quality. At first, the bricks were used only for chimneys, but they were later used to face the lower story of the house, and then the entire house.|$|E

500|$|The set design, too, {{has been}} praised for being [...] "suitably claustrophobic." [...] Robson's {{direction}} has earned kudos for heightening the suspense by leaving certain actions and motives vague. In {{the scene in}} which Seaman Parker (Lawrence Tierney) dies, crushed by the anchor chain, Robson left it unclear whether Captain Stone committed murder by trapping Parker in the anchor chain locker or whether he merely shut the door. The vagueness leaves the audience unsure whether to believe Merriam's accusations against the Captain, and builds an atmosphere of paranoia and doubt which {{is critical to the}} picture's success. Contemporary critic Gary Giddins has pointed out that the film incorporates classic Lewton scare tactics <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>new</b> ways. [...] "His trademark scare tactic, a high point in practically all of his films, is a long, dark, nightmarish walk, where every sound is magnified and every object threatening. In The Ghost Ship, that [...] "walk" [...] is transferred to the cabin of the victimized third officer..." [...] Others have pointed out another Lewton device, the gradual stalking of a main character by a murderer, as another deft touch in the film.|$|E

He suspects that Eliade would have favored [...] "a minimal rather than a maximalist state" [...] that would allow personal spiritual transformation without enforcing it.|$|E

2500|$|In Peru, {{the other}} {{discovery}} that perpetuated {{the system of}} forced labor, the mit'a, was the enormously rich single silver mine discovered at Potosí, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Spain, labor recruitment differed significantly. [...] With the exception of silver mines worked in the Aztec period at Taxco, southwest of Tenochtitlan, the Mexico's mining region was outside the area of dense indigenous settlement. Labor for the mines {{in the north of}} Mexico had a workforce of black slave labor and indigenous wage labor, not draft labor. Indigenous who were drawn to the mining areas were from different regions of the center of Mexico, with a few from the north itself. With such diversity they did not have a common ethnic identity or language and rapidly assimilated to Hispanic culture. Although mining was difficult and dangerous, the wages were good, which is what drew the indigenous labor.|$|E
2500|$|As {{trade in}} {{sandalwood}} declined, it {{was replaced by}} a new form of trade, [...] "blackbirding", a euphemism for tricking Melanesian or Western Pacific Islanders drawn from New Caledonia, the Loyalty Islands, New Hebrides, New Guinea, and the Solomon Islands to work in the sugar cane plantations in Fiji and Queensland. Blackbirding was practiced by both French and British-Australian traders, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>New</b> Caledonia's case, the trade {{in the early decades of}} the twentieth century involved relocating children from the Loyalty islands to the Grand Terre for labour in plantation agriculture. New Caledonia's primary experience with black birding revolved around a trade from the New Hebrides (now Vanuatu) to the Grand Terre for labour in plantation agriculture, mines, as well as guards over convicts and in some public works. [...] The historian Dorothy Shineberg's milestone study, The People Trade, discusses this 'migration' [...] In the early years of the trade, coercion was used to lure Melanesian islanders onto ships; in later years indenture systems were developed, however, when it came to the French trade in people, which took place between its Melanesian colonies of the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, very few regulations were implemented. This represented a departure from the British experience, since increased regulations were developed to mitigate the abuses of black birding and recruitment strategies on the coast lines.|$|E
2500|$|In 1999 Sony {{tried and}} failed to market the series in the United States as Samurai X via an {{existing}} company. The TV series was later licensed in North America by Media Blasters, who split it up into [...] "seasons", and released on DVD. It started airing in the US on the Cartoon Network {{as a part of the}} Toonami Block on March 17, 2003, but ended at the completion of the [...] "second season" [...] (episode 62). Some of the show's depictions of obscene language, intense violence, and tobacco and drug usage were subject to heavy editing on Toonami. Episodes 63-95 did not air, but were included in the DVD release. [...] The [...] "seasons" [...] were later released in three premium [...] "Bento box" [...] DVD boxes on November 18, 2003, March 30, 2004 and July 27, 2004. They were released again, <b>but</b> <b>in</b> <b>new</b> packaging as [...] "economy box" [...] sets on November 15, 2005, January 17, 2006 and February 14, 2006. Columbia Pictures Television (later as Columbia TriStar Television) now Sony Pictures Television International created an English-language version of the series, titled Samurai X, that airs outside of the United States.
