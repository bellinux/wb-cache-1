5|$|During {{the late}} 20th century, {{scholars}} doing {{research into the}} Haymarket affair were {{surprised to learn that}} much of the primary source documentation relating to the incident (beside materials concerning the trial) was not in Chicago, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> transferred to then-communist East Berlin.|$|E
5|$|Ignacio Asteazunzarra (Beltza) {{had been}} arrested in 1973 in Loyola, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> freed by other ETA militants at gunpoint. He was {{believed}} to have been part of a cell which had been particularly active in 1979 in attacks in the province of Álava.|$|E

5|$|Before 1932, the Cipher Bureau {{had succeeded}} in solving an earlier Enigma machine that functioned without a plugboard, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{unsuccessful}} with the Enigma I, a new standard German cipher machine that was coming into widespread use. In late October or early November 1932, {{the head of the}} Cipher Bureau's German section, Captain Maksymilian Ciężki, tasked Rejewski to work alone on the German Enigma I machine {{for a couple of hours}} per day; Rejewski was not to tell his colleagues what he was doing.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{recession}} of the mid-1990s resulted in Highway 407 being truncated in Markham temporarily. Slightly revised plans for the links appeared on the June 2007 Technically Recommended Route Report for the extension of Highway407 to Highway35/115, which was submitted {{as part of the}} environmental assessment (EA) for the extension, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> announced earlier that year on March7 by the Government of Canada, as part of an investment in Greater Toronto Area infrastructure.|$|E

On 3 May, he was replaced by another Spaniard, former Villarreal manager José Francisco Molina. Postiga returned to be the marquee again, but suffered another long-term injury early into the second game of the season. The club's ownership admitted that they had wanted a different marquee due to his record, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unable to sign one.|$|E
5|$|Irene Cara, {{a former}} student of the Performing Arts, was cast as Coco Hernandez. Parker was not {{impressed}} with Cara's musical audition, until after her recording sessions with the film's music composer Michael Gore. Gene Anthony Ray, who plays Leroy Johnson, was also a Performing Arts student <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> expelled from the school for disruptive behavior.

5|$|On August 8, 2007, along {{a remote}} shore of Lake Superior on the Keweenaw Peninsula, a Michigan family {{discovered}} a lone life-saving ring {{that appeared to}} have come from Fitzgerald.

Later it was determined that the life ring was not from Fitzgerald, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> lost by the owner, whose father had made it as a personal memorial.|$|E

5|$|Peckham {{also had}} {{problems}} with his subordinate Thomas Bek, who was Bishop of St David's in Wales. Bek tried to revive a scheme to make St David's independent from Canterbury, and to elevate it to metropolitan status. This had originally been put forth by Gerald of Wales around 1200, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> defeated {{by the actions of}} Hubert Walter, then the Archbishop of Canterbury. Bek did not manage even the four-year fight that Gerald had managed, for Peckham routed him quickly.|$|E
5|$|Police {{also found}} that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club {{restaurant}} worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> cleared by DNA evidence.|$|E
5|$|Some figurines {{have been}} defaced with profanity or Satanic symbols.

5|$|The Guardian was {{a former}} two-decked 44-gun frigate, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> armed en flûte and loaded with stores {{to be taken to}} the British colony at Botany Bay. In {{addition}} to these stores, consisting of seeds, plants, farm machinery and livestock with a total value of some £70,000, the Guardian was also to transport a number of convicts and their overseers. Aboard the Guardian was a young midshipman named Thomas Pitt, the son of politician Thomas Pitt, and nephew of Prime Minister William Pitt.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish National Party (SNP) has {{campaigned for}} a place in Eurovision for Scotland <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> {{rejected}} numerous times because Scotland is represented {{as a part of}} the British entry and is represented by the BBC. On 11 February 2008 the EBU stated that a Scottish broadcaster could apply for EBU membership, but under the current rules could not enter the Eurovision Song Contest as the BBC currently has exclusive rights to represent the entire United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, Visscher surrendered {{control of}} the military to Glan. Not long afterwards, news reached him that Yonko had not joined the insurgents <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> robbed, spending the night at his son's grave in Peterongan in depression. This revitalised Visscher, who retook command of the military on 4 May and ordered everyone to return to their homes. Several days afterwards, four regents– Suradiningrat from Tuban, Martapura from Grobogan, Suradimenggala from Kaliwungu, and Awangga from Kendal– arrived at Semarang, reporting that the 6,000 promised troops were on their way.|$|E

5|$|U-9, {{commanded}} by Kapitänleutnant Otto Weddigen, {{had been ordered}} to attack British transports at Ostend, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> forced to dive and take shelter from the storm. On surfacing, she spotted the British ships and moved to attack. She fired one torpedo at 06:20 at Aboukir which struck her on the starboard side; the ship's captain thought he had struck a mine and ordered the other two ships to close to transfer his wounded men. Aboukir quickly began listing and capsized around 06:55 despite counterflooding compartments {{on the opposite side}} to right her.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the Great War, Playford {{returned}} to South Australia with his battalion, disembarking at Outer Harbor, Adelaide on 2 July 1919. He had received no decorations, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> commissioned from the ranks as an officer and was honourably discharged in October with the rank of lieutenant. Despite Playford's intellectual capability, he shunned the Government's offer of free university education for soldiers and {{returned to}} his orchard. He continued growing cherries on the property, and engaged in his hobby of horticulture. His involvement in various organisations and clubs was renewed.|$|E
5|$|Yerkes' first {{acquisition}} in London was the Charing Cross, Euston and Hampstead Railway (CCE). The {{company had}} parliamentary permission {{to build a}} deep-level tube railway from Charing Cross to Hampstead and Highgate, <b>but</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> unable to raise the finance, selling {{only a tiny fraction}} of the shares available. Robert Perks, a solicitor for a number of railway companies and Member of Parliament for Louth, had suggested the CCE to Yerkes and the American's consortium bought the company for £100,000 (approximately £ today) on 28 September 1900.|$|E
