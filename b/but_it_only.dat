5|$|Attrition by 1942 {{had created}} a {{shortage}} of experienced combat leaders. No special training was made available for this role. Galland set up a course in late 1943, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> lasted a few months. Galland {{was quoted as saying}} he thought they could learn the skills while on operations, as he had. This ignored his own talents, and blithely expected other pilots to reach his high standards.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of the Greenstead Parish {{boundary}} is Rovers Tye Farm, which has been documented as being established by 1353. A new causeway at this location had been built by 1429, by which point Ipswich Road ran on its current route. This road was turnpiked in 1725, when the road was predominantly rural in nature. In 1841, a prison, known as the House of Correction or County Gaol, was built on the road to alleviate pressure on Colchester Castle, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> held about 25 or 30 prisoners, both male and female, at any one time.|$|E
5|$|In 1936, SR85 was established, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> {{extended}} as {{far north}} as Gila Bend and as far south as Ajo. By 1938, SR85 had been paved as well as the portion between Ajo and Why that would eventually become part of SR85. The portion between Why and the border with Mexico began showing up on maps at this time as a gravel road. In 1943, the portion of the highway between Ajo and Why was added to the state highway system, but as SR86, when it was extended west from Tucson to Ajo. In 1955, the highway was extended to Lukeville at the United States-Mexico border with an overlap with SR86 between Ajo and Why when a county road was added to SR85.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his personal role in Parliament, Bute sought to control the votes {{of members of the}} House of Commons, primarily to ensure the passage of legislation affecting his business interests. Initially, the Isle of Bute had only 21 voters who were dominated by his private estate, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> returned a Member of Parliament in alternate elections, and his estates in Luton were too limited to allow him to influence the electoral process there. The best remaining option for Bute was to control the voting in Cardiff, but even here he had to choose his candidate carefully and apply careful financial pressure through his control of leases and rents to ensure their election.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, Sony {{announced}} {{a drop in}} the price of the console by $100. This measure only applied to the 60 GB models and was exclusive to the United States and Canada, where those models are no longer in production. On October 18, 2007, Sony {{announced a}} US$100 price drop for the 80GB model and a new US$399 40GB model to launch on November 2, 2007 with reduced features such as the removal of backward compatibility with PS2 games. Within weeks, Sony announced that sales of the 40 GB and 80 GB models by major retailers had increased 192%. In November 2008, Sony launched a $499 160 GB model, and on August 18, 2009, Sony announced the PS3 Slim. The PS3 slim sold 1 million in under a month. It was then announced that a 250GB slim model was to be released. It was released on September 1 (or 3 depending on country) and costs $299, £249 and €299. In Australia the console will cost A$499, which is A$200 less than the standard PS3. In September 2009, a $299 120 GB Slim Model was released. A $349 250 GB Model was later released later in 2009. In August 2010, the 160 GB Slim Model was released for $299. The same price for a 120 GB PS3 slim Model. In Japan, the 160GB slim model is also available in white. On September 17, 2010, Sony released the 320GB Slim Model, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>only</b> sold with the PlayStation Move for US$399.99.|$|E
