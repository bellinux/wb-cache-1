Despite her research background, Gerty was only offered a position as a research associate at a salary one tenth of that received by her husband; she was warned that she might harm her husband's career. Washington University's Chancellor, Arthur Holley Compton made a special allowance for Gerty {{to hold a position}} there, going against the university's nepotism rules. Gerty had to wait thirteen years before she attained the same rank as her husband. In 1943, she was made an associate professor of Research <b>Biological</b> <b>Chemistry</b> and Pharmacology.

25|$|The {{original}} {{plan was to}} have no academic sub-divisions within the three faculties (initially Humanities, Social Sciences and Natural Sciences) and to incorporate an interdisciplinary element to all degrees through common first year courses ("Part I") in each faculty, followed by specialist study {{in the second and}} final years ("Part II"). The lack of Departments encouraged the development of courses that crossed traditional divides, such as Chemical Physics, Chemistry with Control Engineering, <b>Biological</b> <b>Chemistry</b> and Environmental Physical Science.|$|E
25|$|Although Jaffe's name {{is synonymous}} with {{clinical}} creatinine testing, his paper only described the principle behind what would later become the enduring method. It was Otto Folin (1867–1934), a Harvard biochemist, who adapted Jaffe's research—abandoning the standard Neubauer reaction of the time—and published several papers using the Jaffe reaction to analyze creatinine levels in both blood and urine. Folin began using the picric acid procedure in 1901 and included it in his 1916 Lab Manual of <b>Biological</b> <b>Chemistry.</b> During his career, Folin modified and improved several quantitative colorimetric procedures, {{the first of which}} was for creatinine. He took advantage of technology available at the time, using a Duboscq colorimeter for measurement precision, and is credited for introducing colorimetry into modern biochemical analysis.|$|E
25|$|Biochemistry, {{sometimes}} called <b>biological</b> <b>chemistry,</b> {{is the study}} of chemical processes within and relating to living organisms. By controlling information flow through biochemical signaling and the flow of chemical energy through metabolism, biochemical processes give rise to the complexity of life. Over the last decades of the 20th century, biochemistry has become so successful at explaining living processes that now almost all areas of the life sciences from botany to medicine to genetics are engaged in biochemical research. Today, the main focus of pure biochemistry is on understanding how biological molecules give rise to the processes that occur within living cells, which in turn relates greatly to the study and understanding of tissues, organs, and whole organisms—that is, all of biology.|$|E

25|$|Doudna entered Pomona College in Claremont, California {{to study}} biochemistry. During her sophomore year, while taking {{a course in}} general chemistry, she {{questioned}} her own ability {{to pursue a career}} in science, and considered switching her major to French. However, her French teacher suggested her to stick with science. Fred Grieman and Corwin Hansch, both professors of chemistry at Pomona, had a major impact on her. She started her first scientific research in the lab of Sharon Panasenko. She earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Biochemistry from Pomona College in 1985. She went to Harvard Medical School for her doctoral study and earned a Ph.D. in <b>Biological</b> <b>Chemistry</b> and Molecular Pharmacology in 1989. Her Ph.D. thesis was on engineering a self-replicating catalytic RNA and was supervised by Jack W. Szostak. From 1989 to 1991, she held research fellowships in molecular biology at the Massachusetts General Hospital and in genetics at Harvard Medical School. From 1991 to 1994, she was Lucille P.
