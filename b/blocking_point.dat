These mutants exhibit normal vegetative growth at permissive temperature but are unable to complete a cell cycle (or a specified number of cell cycles) at restrictive temperature. A simple technique has been devised to determine the cell cycle stage in each mutant when the defective gene product, which ultimately affects cell division, completes its function. This stage is called the "block point", and is determined by scoring the residual cell division in an exponentially growing population after shift to temperature restrictive conditions. In the cb mutants isolated so far, <b>block</b> <b>points</b> representing many stages throughout the cell cycle have been found.

40|$|From February to April 1999, wave-blocking {{experiments}} {{have been conducted}} at the Laboratory of Fluid Mechanics of the Faculty of Civil Engineering and Geosciences, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands {{as a part of}} the Ph. D. research of I. K. Suastika. Wave blocking is a special case of wave-current interaction. It can occur when waves are propagating against a counter of which the velocity is increasing in the wave propagation direction. Blocking occurs where the intrinsic wave group velocity (cg) is equal, but opposite in sign, to the mean velocity. The counter current velocity at the <b>blocking</b> <b>point</b> is called the blocking velocity. In this thesis the experiments are described and a part of the measurement data is analysed, especially the data concerning the blocking of irregular waves. The first objective of this research is to acquire quantitative data on partial and complete blocking. The second objective is to develop a model for wave blocking. The model should describe the wave field in a situation where blocking occurs. 80, for a given incoming (generated) wave field and counter current, the model should describe the wave field up to and at the <b>blocking</b> <b>point.</b> (And beyond, in cases of partial blocking.)

40|$|Blockage {{of waves}} by a current can occur if waves are {{propagating}} on a spatially varying opposing current {{in which the}} velocity is increasing in the wave propagation direction. The ongoing waves become shorter and steeper while they are propagating against the current. Blocking occurs at the location where the opposing current strength {{is the same as}} the effective wave energy transport velocity, the intrinsic wave group velocity. This implies that upstream of this location, the <b>blocking</b> <b>point,</b> there is no propagation of wave energy. A question that immediately arises is what happens with the ongoing wave energy. The theory suggests that the ongoing waves will break before reaching the <b>blocking</b> <b>point</b> due to steepening of the waves. However, other mechanisms than wave breaking may also play an important role in the wave energy dissipation such as energy dissipations due to wave interactions with the turbulence and due to viscous effects. Another possibility is that the ongoing wave energy may be partially reflected at the <b>blocking</b> <b>point.</b> Some earlier studies (e. g. Long et al [1993]) have reported some evidence of wave reflection in blocking situations. The present study aims to investigate experimentally the phenomena of wave breaking and/or wave reflection in blocking situations. For this purpose a novel experimental arrangement has been designed and implemented in a laboratory flume. Previous laboratory studies utilized a constant discharge (Q) and a varying cross section (A) to obtain a longitudinal velocity gradient. This has the disadvantage that the effects of non-uniform cross-section and non-uniform velocity are mixed. In the present study, it was decided to use a constant cross-section and a non-uniform discharge, to he obtained by withdrawal of water through a perforated false bottom. CONCLUSIONS The fitted model has shown to he capable to reproduce the wave field of monochromatic waves being blocked by a counter current reasonably well, allowing us to discriminate the reflected waves and the incoming waves. However, the model in its present form contains unknown calibration coefficients whose variation requires further study and most likely a reformulation of the dissipation model.

40|$|Wave {{blocking}} in river inlets is examined using the NHWAVE (Non-Hydrostatic Wave) model under development. Blocking flows at river inlets {{are a significant}} hazard to navigation. Refractive and shoaling effects contribute to the enhancement of wave field energy, causing instabilities and breaking, resulting in energy dissipation and transfer at the <b>blocking</b> <b>point.</b> The non-linearity of wave-current interactions and wave breaking makes the dynamics of blocking flows difficult to model. Current efforts to use wave-averaged models are insufficient to describe the complex dynamics that occur within one or two wavelengths of a <b>blocking</b> <b>point.</b> NHWAVE uses the non-hydrostatic, incompressible Navier-Stokes equations to model fully dispersive wave processes in the time domain. Monochromatic wave cases are explored and compared with lab experiments of energy dissipation due to wave breaking under conditions of strong opposing current, conducted in 2002 at the University of Delaware by A. Chawla and T. J. Kirby. The model was initially unable to resolve the boundary conditions necessary to model wave {{blocking in}} a tank domain. However, developments to the numerical scheme in NHWAVE have advanced its capability in this regard. Due to the difficulties of modeling the dynamics of wave blocking and the boundary conditions in a wave tank, only preliminary results were obtained. NHWAVE needs further development; it shows promise, however, {{to be able to}} predict wave reflection, blocking, and dissipation on a strong opposing current. Lieutenant, United States Nav...|$|E

40|$|We {{have studied}} the thermal {{relaxation}} of artifcial spin ice in its two main geometries, namely artificial square ice and artificial kagome spin ice. Using synchrotron based photoemission electron microscopy {{we are able to}} directly observe how artificial square ice systems find their way from an energetically excited state to one of the two degenerate ground state configuration. On plotting vertex type populations as a function of time, we can characterize the relaxation, which occurs in two stages, namely a string and a domain regime. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations agree well with the temporal evolution of the magnetic state when including disorder, and the experimental results can be explained by considering the effective interaction energy associated with the separation of pairs of vertex excitations. While a simple thermal annealing procedure, that involved one cycle of heating and cooling the sample above and below the blocking temperature (T = 320 - 330 K), proved to be very effective in achieving long-range ordered ground state configurations in artificial square ice, the ability of achieving the same goal in artificial kagome spin ice is shown to become increasingly difficult with increasing system size. By first focusing on the so-called building block structures of artificial kagome spin ice, with system sizes ranging from a single ring up to seven-ring structures, we proved that the abilitiy to access the ground state is lost at a system size comprising seven kagome rings. Extrapolating the result to extended arrays of artificiall kagome spin ice, we conclude that a long-range ordered gound state is unlikely to be achieved in an infinite array of artificial kagome spin ice. This conclusion is later confirmed by investigating thermal annealing on extended arrays of artificial kagome spin ice. Finally, we explored a potential optimization of thermal annealing on artificial kagome spin ice. For this purpose, we patterned artificial kagome spin ice arrays with lower blocking temperatures (T = 160 K), hoping that the blocking temperature to be below the predicted temperatures for phase transitions into ordered configurations. Both continuous and stepped cooling from temperatures around 370 K down to 140 K proved to be inefficient in achieving ground state configurations. We then applied an annealing procedure that involved repeated heating and cooling just slightly around the <b>blocking</b> <b>point</b> (T = 160 K), thus allowing the system slow attempts in accessing ground state configurations, while above the <b>blocking</b> <b>point,</b> and capture such configurational changes by cooling back down below the <b>blocking</b> <b>point.</b> So far, this procedure represents the only known way to access local ground state configurations in artificial kagome spin ice and paves the way to explore even more sophisticated annealing procedures that remain to be discovered in future work...|$|E

The SpTS kernel, however, greatly depends on the input parameters, such as the nonzero pattern of the matrix. The access patterns are also very irregular, which limits the scalability of the kernel and poses significant parallelizing challenges.

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} on monochromatic waves being blocked by opposing currents are presented in this paper. A heirarchial pattern in the wave field characteristics was observed with increasing wave amplitude. A shoaling model using a bore dissipation formulation to simulate current limited breaking is compared with the data. It is observed that amplitude dispersion {{plays an important role}} in wave blocking and cannot be ignored. For the large amplitude waves side band instabilities radically affect the wave field and prevent wave blocking. Introduction Wave blocking occurs in regions (e. g. mouths of river inlets) where the currents are opposing the waves. The opposing current slows down the waves leading to an increase in the wave steepness, which sometimes leads to wave breaking. The waves get blocked when the current is strong enough to prevent the wave energy from traveling upstream. That is when the group velocity C g goes to zero.
