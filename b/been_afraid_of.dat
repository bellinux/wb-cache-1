They went by, fallen, dragging their packs, dragging their lives, deserting their homes, the years of their childhood, cringing like beaten dogs.|$|E
5|$|Coakley's {{rebuttal}} witnesses {{consisted of}} officers who had interrogated the prisoners at Camp Shoemaker. The rebuttal fared poorly, as Veltmann {{was able to}} elicit from them {{that some of the}} accused men had not been informed they could refuse to make a statement, that some of the interrogations had taken place with an armed sentry standing guard, that very few of the prisoners' explanations that they had <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> another explosion had been laid down in the statements, and that the officers had emphasized portions of the interrogations that would satisfy Coakley's requirement for evidence of conspiracy. Coakley's last rebuttal witness testified on October 19, and the whole court took October 20 off to allow both sides to prepare closing arguments.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} Season 4, Wilson {{starts a}} romantic {{relationship}} with Amber Volakis, who is essentially a female version of House, and who competed {{for one of the}} open jobs on House's team in the wake of Foreman, Chase, and Cameron's departure. In the Season 4 finale, she dies after a bus crash sustained while picking up a drunken House from a bar. Her death eventually leads Wilson to conclude that his relationship with House serves to enable House's dysfunctions. To remove himself from House's influence, he resigns from Princeton-Plainsboro at the beginning of Season 5. The two reconcile when Wilson forces House to attend the funeral of House's father. Wilson realizes that he had <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> losing House, who is his true friend, and that Wilson's life didn't get any better when he resigned. He then returns to Princeton-Plainsboro.|$|E

5|$|These events {{threatened}} Serbia, {{which had}} severed ties with Catholicism and {{was once again}} fully Orthodox. The marriage alliance between Vladislav and Ivan Asen II may {{be a result of}} the Hungarian threat to both of the rulers' countries. Some scholars have speculated that Vladislav accepted Bulgarian suzerainty, but this speculation has no evidence to support it, since no contemporary sources say that Vladislav recognized Asen as overlord of Serbia. However, Asen likely had the largest influence on the politics of Vladislav. Vladislav seems to have been left out of Orthodox alliance founded by Asen. Vladislav may have <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> close ties with Bulgaria, since his brother Radoslav's close ties with the Despotate of Epirus had caused dissatisfaction among the Serbian nobility. This shows that Vladislav was not too dependent upon Bulgaria, as he was not obliged to join the alliance; if he had recognized the suzerainty of Asen, he likely would have forced to join the alliance.|$|E

Karen is escaping the pressures of her recent engagement to Ray Forrestier, ambivalent about the wedding; Ray himself is on a business trip. Her time with Uncle Bill and Aunt Violet is rather uneventful and uninspiring until Uncle Bill, a nervous and socially inadequate man, tells Karen that Violet is to have surgery in the coming weeks, a procedure that could prove fatal. Back in England, Karen finds Naomi Fisher waiting for her; she has travelled to London to see to the affairs of her recently deceased aunt, and tells Karen of her engagement to Max Ebhart, whom Karen met years before while {{she was one of the}} girls staying at Mme Fisher's house. Despite Karen's objections — she had always <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> Max — Naomi insists the three spend time together before Max and Naomi return home.|$|E

Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly. [...] "Someone has to get the country, and I think we should have the best chance," [...] Rhodes told Rothschild; [...] "I have always <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king.

500|$|Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "A Short Story About Love" [...] {{the fifteenth}} best {{episode of the}} series, {{explaining}} [...] "The timeline reboot of season 4 frustrated some fans, but the premise yielded several truly cool capture-the-imagination ideas that made for provocative drama, most notably Fringes most romantic hour... The fact that the episode also featured one of the show's seediest creepazoids — a serial killer who murdered men for their pheromones so {{he could make a}} perfume that allowed him to seduce their grieving female significant others — was a bonus. Icky, but bonus." [...] Cory Barker of TV.com named the episode the 17th best of the series, saying, [...] "Fringe has never <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> coming up with intimate, emotionally based—and sometimes very hokey—resolutions for its grand plots. Whatever you think about the choices the writers made in Season 4, it's hard to deny the emotional wallop this episode delivered." ...|$|E
500|$|Sinatra became {{increasingly}} {{frustrated with the}} status of the Harry James band, feeling that he was not achieving the major success and acclaim he was looking for. His pianist and close friend Hank Sanicola persuaded him to stay with the group, but in November 1939 he left James to replace Jack Leonard as the lead singer of the Tommy Dorsey band. Sinatra signed a contract with Dorsey for $125 a week at Palmer House in Chicago, and James agreed amicably to release Sinatra from his contract. On January 26, 1940, he made his first public appearance with the band at the Coronado Theatre in Rockford, Illinois, opening the show with [...] "Stardust". Dorsey recalled: [...] "You could almost feel the excitement coming up out of the crowds when the kid stood up to sing. Remember, he was no matinée idol. He was just a skinny kid with big ears. I used to stand there so amazed I'd almost forget to take my own solos". Dorsey was a major influence on Sinatra and became a father figure. Sinatra copied Dorsey's mannerisms and traits, becoming a demanding perfectionist like him, even adopting his hobby of toy trains. He asked Dorsey to be godfather to his daughter Nancy in June 1940. Sinatra later said that [...] "The only two people I've ever <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> are my mother and Tommy Dorsey". Though Kelley claims that Sinatra and drummer Buddy Rich were bitter rivals, other authors state that they were friends and even roommates when the band was on the road, but professional jealousy surfaced as both men wanted to be considered the star of Dorsey's band. Later, Sinatra helped Rich form his own band with a $25,000 loan and provided financial help to Rich during times of the drummer's serious illness.|$|E

He commented: [...] "The twin hospital dramas have never <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> didactic storylines, but this example, constructed {{to illustrate the}} ethical dilemmas of those involved, is about as didactic as it gets. Let's hope this benevolent propaganda works." [...] The Sun, however, selected the episode as a televisual [...] "Pick of the Day", while the Daily Mail reported that John Evans, chairman of the British Organ Donor Society, had received the episode positively.|$|E

Haye later arranged a fight with Tyson Fury at the same venue on 28 September 2013. However, {{a week before the}} fight, David Haye sustained a cut to the head which required several stitches, so yet again the fight was postponed. It was originally rescheduled for 8 February 2014. However Haye dropped out of the fight on 17 November 2013 after shoulder surgery. Fury meanwhile, believed that Haye was making excuses because he didn't want the fight, with Fury himself saying [...] "I'm absolutely furious but in all honesty this is exactly what I expected. Everyone knows I was very suspicious when he pulled out the first time and this confirms to me that he's always <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> me and never wanted this fight." [...] Aside from training camp expenses, Haye also cost Fury his positions in the world rankings including an IBF final eliminator bout which would have made him mandatory for a shot at the world title. Although doctors advised Haye to retire from boxing, he never officially announced his retirement.|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{it appears}} likely that Spinoza {{had already taken}} the {{initiative}} to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his Theological-Political Treatise that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons, he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the [...] "monstrous deed," [...] contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including Maimonides), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he {{is reported to have}} said: [...] "Very well; this does not force me to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not <b>been</b> <b>afraid</b> <b>of</b> a scandal." [...] Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.|$|E
