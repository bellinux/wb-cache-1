50|$|The Turtle Conservancy {{is working}} to {{purchase}} {{a significant portion of}} the last remaining habitat of the <b>Bolson</b> <b>Tortoise</b> (Gopherus flavomarginatus). The largest of the North American terrestrial reptiles, this tortoise has been known to science only since 1959. The <b>Bolson</b> <b>Tortoise</b> inhabits a small area of Bolsón de Mapimí in the Chihuahuan Desert of Mexico. The Mapimí Biosphere Reserve was created to protect this species, but much of this land is used for agricultural development and cattle grazing, which is threatening the tortoise’s habitat. The acquisition of this land in north central Mexico will protect the tortoise along with all other native flora and fauna including an estimated 28 mammals, over 200 bird species, 5 amphibians, and 39 reptiles.|$|E
50|$|In 1979 the 340,000 hectare Mapimi Biosphere Reserve {{was created}} to protect the <b>Bolson</b> <b>Tortoise</b> and other unique flora and fauna of the Bolsón de Mapimí. Despite this designation, cattle {{ranching}} and mining still occur in the Reserve. Whether this is detrimental to the tortoise is not known.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Bolson</b> <b>Tortoise</b> was {{recently}} {{brought to the}} world's attention when in August 2005 a provocative article on [...] "Pleistocene rewilding" [...] appeared in the journal Nature (Donlan, et al., 2005) proposing that megafauna that became extinct in North America {{at the close of}} the Pleistocene (~12,800 years ago) be reintroduced to the continent to create a Pleistocene Park. The <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> was the first species proposed for this restoration effort. The tortoise is unique in that, unlike mammoths, sabre-toothed cats and giant ground sloths, it is not extinct. The Turner Endangered Species Fund, who re-introduced the tortoise to New Mexico, has made it clear that the restoration of the tortoise to the Southwest is an endangered species recovery project and not a [...] "rewilding" [...] project, although elements of rewilding exist.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bolson</b> <b>{{tortoise}}</b> (Gopherus flavomarginatus), {{also called}} the Mexican giant tortoise or yellow-margined tortoise, is a species of tortoise from North America. Of the six North American tortoise species, it is the largest, having a carapace length of about 46 cm. It lives in a region of the Chihuahuan Desert known as the Bolsón de Mapimí, which is located in north-central Mexico.|$|E
50|$|The {{reintroduction}} of <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise,</b> equids (mustangs and burros) and camelids (dromedary) {{has already}} begun. Muskoxen roam areas of Europe and Asia last grazed during Rome's heyday, and bison herds thrive in subarctic Canada and Alaska. As of 2011, {{there are no}} active plans to reintroduce more exotic megafauna, such as elephants, cheetahs or lions, due to the controversial nature of these reintroductions.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> was {{discovered}} only in 1959. The legend {{is that a}} group of biologists working in the Bolsón de Mapimí were at a ranch and saw chickens eating out of a large tortoise shell. They inquired about the origin of the shell and the locals responded by saying that it was, [...] "la tortuga grande del desierto," [...] the big turtle of the desert.|$|E
5000|$|A {{controversial}} 2005 {{editorial in}} Nature, signed {{by a number}} of conservation biologists, took up the argument, urging that elephants, lions, and cheetahs could be reintroduced in protected areas in the Great Plains. The <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise,</b> discovered in 1959 in Durango, Mexico, was the first species proposed for this restoration effort, and in 2006 the species was reintroduced to two ranches in New Mexico owned by media mogul Ted Turner.|$|E
50|$|Turtle Conservancy began a {{collaborative}} effort - along with assistance from the Andrew Sabin Family foundation, Josiah T. Austin, and the Desert Tortoise Council - of acquiring 43,000 acres {{of land in the}} state of Durango, Mexico. Located in the Chihuahuan Desert, this land is noted for being prime habitat of <b>Bolson</b> <b>Tortoise</b> (Gopherus flavomarginatus), as well as other species of plants and animals essential to maintaining the biodiversity of the area. The goal of this project is to preserve the largest intact population of <b>Bolson</b> <b>Tortoise</b> remaining, and would be functioning as a long-term re-introduction plan with the Turner Endangered Species Fund. Founder Eric Goode traveled to Madagascar to meet with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust (DWCT) to discuss the status of the Critically Endangered Ploughshare Tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora). The following year, the IUCN held a Red List workshop in Madagascar to reclassify the endemic IUCN listed species, at which the Turtle Conservancy attended and assisted in drafting an Action Plan for Radiated Tortoise (Astrochelys radiata), Flat-tailed Tortoise (Pyxis planicauda), Madagascar Big-headed Turtle (Erymnochelys madagascariensis), and the Critically Endangered Ploughshare Tortoise (Astrochelys yniphora).|$|E
50|$|Biologically rich, it {{includes}} 403 plant species. Noteworthy are the 39 cactus species and 200 species of birds, 5 species of amphibians, 36 species of reptiles and 28 species of mammals. Endemic species identified are nine for the Cactaceae family, {{one for the}} Cochlospermaceae family {{and one for the}} Fouqueriaceae family. Particularly charismatic are the <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Gopherus flavomarginatus), the kit fox (Vulpes macrotis), the Mexican fringe-toed lizard (Uma paraphigas), the mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus), the American badger (Taxidea taxus), the puma (Puma concolor); and birds such as the golden eagle (Aquila crhysaetos).|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> {{will expand}} its prehistoric {{population}} and thrive {{in places like}} Texas. Feral horses will be encouraged to breed and multiply, and will be proxies for extinct equids. Camelids (of the genera Camelus, Lama, and Vicugna) will serve as proxies for the approximately six extinct camel species in North America. The African cheetah will serve for the American cheetah, while the African lion will serve for the American lion. The elephant species will represent the five species of mammoth, mastodon, and gomphothere which thrived in North America.|$|E
50|$|The Pleistocene rewilding project aims at the {{promotion}} of extant fauna and the reintroduction of extinct genera in the southwestern United States. Native fauna are the first genera for reintroduction. The <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> was widespread during the Pleistocene era, and continued to be common during the Holocene epoch until recent times. Its reintroduction from northern Mexico would be a necessary step to recreate the soil humidity present in the Pleistocene, which would support grassland and extant shrub-land and provide the habitat required for the herbivores set for reintroduction. However, to be successful, ecologists will support fauna already present in the region.|$|E
50|$|In {{the fall}} of 2006, 26 Bolson Tortoises were {{translocated}} from the Audubon Appleton-Whittell Research Ranch in Elgin, Arizona to Ted Turner’s Armendaris Ranch in south-central New Mexico, a Chihuahuan desert environment within the prehistoric range of this species. These tortoises, known as the Appleton tortoises in commemoration of Ariel Appleton, a champion of <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> conservation, were originally brought to Arizona from Durango, Mexico by Dr. David Morafka in 1973. Four tortoises from the Appleton population were established at the Living Desert Museum in Carlsbad, New Mexico. Both locations have active breeding programs in place.|$|E
50|$|The Turtle Conservancy’s in-country {{conservation}} strategies include habitat protection, {{restoration and}} stewardship, turtle and tortoise reintroduction and a fieldwork grant program. In South Africa the Turtle Conservancy owns and stewards more than 1,000 {{acres of land}} in the last remaining habitat for the critically endangered Geometric Tortoise in South Africa. This land is critical habitat needed to save this beautiful tortoise from extinction. In Mexico the Turtle Conservancy is working to protect 43,000 acres of what {{is believed to be the}} last stronghold for the <b>Bolson</b> <b>Tortoise,</b> the largest terrestrial reptile in North America. In Madagascar the Turtle Conservancy collaborates with Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust in protecting the Ploughshare Tortoise from extinction. The Turtle Conservancy engages in education of communities and animal marking to eliminate the illegal poaching of Ploughshare Tortoises. In addition, the Turtle Conservancy is a leading member of the International Ploughshare or Angonoka Working Group, which sets direction for Ploughshare Conservation worldwide. The Turtle Conservancy also supports field work in Nicaragua, Mexico, Guyana, Pakistan, India, the Philippines, Namibia, Indonesia, China, and Myanmar.|$|E
40|$|The {{decrease}} of the habitat {{is one of}} the main factors that affect the survival of G. flavomarginatus. This study assesses the halophytic grasslands loss over a period of 30 years in the distribution area of the <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> and the effects of climate change on the habitat suitability of these grasslands and its possible impact on this tortoise. Grassland loss was assessed by an analysis of symmetric differences and the habitat suitability model was carried out by the method of overlapping layers raster. Our results showed a grassland loss of 63. 7 %; however, our current habitat suitability model points out that much of the grassland loss has occurred where the environmental conditions are suitable. These results suggest that anthropic activity is a main factor in the habitat disturbance in the study area. Likewise, the models for years 2050 and 2070 under the criteria RCP 2. 6, RCP 4. 5, RCP 6. 0, suggest that anthropic activity will continue be the main cause of the grassland loss. Therefore, considering the association between the <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> and grassland halophyte Hilaria mutica, which comprises around 60 % of its diet, the viability of the <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> depends largely on strategies aimed at protecting the soil that allow the presence of this grassland...|$|E
40|$|A {{widespread}} biogeographic {{pattern in}} nature is that population abundance is not uniform across the geographic range of species: most occurrence sites have relatively low numbers, whereas {{a few places}} contain orders of magnitude more individuals. The <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> Gopherus flavomarginatus is endemic to a small region of the Chihuahuan Desert in Mexico, where habitat deterioration threatens this species with extinction. In this study we combined field burrows counts and the approach for modeling species abundance based on calculating {{the distance to the}} niche centroid to obtain range-wide abundance estimates. For the <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise,</b> we found a robust, negative relationship between observed burrows abundance and distance to the niche centroid, with a predictive capacity of 71 %. Based on these results we identified four priority areas for the conservation of this microendemic and threatened tortoise. We conclude that this approach may be a useful approximation for identifying key areas for sampling and conservation efforts in elusive and rare species...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Gopherus flavomarginatus) is {{the first}} species of extirpated megafauna to be repatriated into the United States. In September 2006, 30 {{individuals}} were translocated from Arizona to New Mexico with the long-term objective of restoring wild populations via captive propagation. We evaluated mtDNA sequences and allelic diversity among 11 microsatellite loci from the captive population and archived samples collected from wild individuals in Durango, Mexico (n = 28). Both populations exhibited very low genetic diversity and the captive population captured roughly 97. 5 % of the total wild diversity, making it a promising founder population. Genetic screening of other captive animals (n = 26) potentially suitable for reintroduction uncovered multiple hybrid G. flavomarginatus 6 G. polyphemus, which were ineligible for repatriation; only three of these individuals were verified as purebred G. flavomarginatus. We used these genetic data to inform mate pairing, reduce the potential for inbreeding and to monitor the maintenance of genetic diversity in the captive population. After six years of successful propagation, we analyzed the parentage of 241 hatchlings to assess the maintenance of genetic diversity. Not all adults contributed equally to successive generations. Most yearly cohorts of hatchlings failed to capture {{the diversity of the}} parental population. However, overlapping generations of tortoises helped to alleviate genetic loss because the entire six-year cohort of hatchlings contained the allelic diversity of the parental population. Polyandry and sperm storage occurred in the captives and future management strategies must consider suc...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Bolson</b> <b>tortoise,</b> Gopherus flavomarginatus, occurs {{within a}} {{restricted}} geographical {{area in the}} Mexican Chihuahuan Desert. We analyzed the variation in surface microhabitat with relation to the burrow occupancy for this tortoise at the Mapimí Biosphere Reserve, Mexico. In summer 2010, we monitored burrow activity (active, inactive, or abandoned) and measured environmental factors that might influence the burrow’s occupancy by tortoises (air temperature, relative humidity and substrate temperature, {{both inside and outside}} the burrow, and the plant cover around it). Discriminant analysis was used to identify the importance of these variables influencing burrow occupancy. Correlation and linear regression analyses were performed to quantify the relation between environmental factors in the sampled burrows. Results. Sixty-one burrows were identified at the Tortugas locality. The first function’s auto-value analysis indicates that this function explains 97. 9 % of the variation in burrow activity status; high occupancy scores were associated with low substrate temperature inside the burrow. Plant cover was inversely proportional to substrate temperature inside the burrow. These results suggest the importance the density of plants surrounding the tortoise’s burrow as a key factor influencing the burrow microclimate and occupancy by the tortoises. Conclusions. Gopherus flavomarginatus inhabits burrows, in part, based on microhabitat structure, with plant cover being a main factor influencing burrow occupancy. Our findings indicate that human land use and vegetation management are important for conserving Bolson tortoises, and for understanding habitat conditions necessary for the successful establishment of populations elsewhere...|$|E
