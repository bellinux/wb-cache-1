5|$|The Deal is a 2003 British {{television}} film directed by Stephen Frears from a script by Peter Morgan, {{based in part}} upon The Rivals by James Naughtie. The film stars David Morrissey as Gordon Brown and Michael Sheen as Tony <b>Blair,</b> <b>and</b> depicts the Blair-Brown deal—a well-documented pact that <b>Blair</b> <b>and</b> Brown made whereby Brown would not stand in the 1994 Labour leadership election, so that Blair could have a clear run at becoming leader {{of the party and}} Prime Minister. The film begins on 9 June 1983, as <b>Blair</b> <b>and</b> Brown are first elected to Parliament, and concludes in May 1994 at the Granita restaurant—the location of the supposed agreement—with a brief epilogue following the leadership contest.|$|E
5|$|In 2007, Gossip Girl {{was adapted}} for {{television}}. According to Cecily von Ziegesar, the television character is largely {{faithful to the}} original. Among the aspects to be maintained are her admiration for Audrey Hepburn and her interest in Yale University. However, the series is also noted for its deviations from the source material, including the exclusion of Blair's brother Tyler. The show also explores romances between <b>Blair</b> <b>and</b> multiple male leads, resulting in occasional love triangles. In the fifth season, Blair is revealed to be pregnant with Prince of Monaco, Louis Grimaldi's child. However the child later dies before birth after a car crash <b>Blair</b> <b>and</b> Chuck were in.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been rumoured a deal was struck between <b>Blair</b> <b>and</b> Brown at the former Granita {{restaurant}} in Islington, in which Blair promised to give Brown control of economic policy in return for Brown not standing against him in the leadership election. Whether this is true or not, the relationship between <b>Blair</b> <b>and</b> Brown was central to the fortunes of New Labour, and they mostly remained united in public, despite reported serious private rifts.|$|E

The claims and counterclaims {{between the two sides}} reached such an extreme that an 1826 letter in the New Court Argus suggested that New Court supporters had instigated Sharp's murder in order to blame Old Court partisans and affix a stigma to them.|$|E
5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone.

5|$|As {{the first}} President, Washington was {{responsible}} for appointing the entire Supreme Court.

The Court’s first term began on February 2, 1790, at the Royal Exchange in New York City.
