When their other halves arrive, (Adi and Buddy) it seems as though they bring out the worst in Nate and Jenny. Dinner is uncomfortable and after dinner is even more uncomfortable, especially when Adi breaks up with Nate. The reason being money and his lost job. Meanwhile, Jenny is leaving town for a wedding and Buddy refuses to go with her so he can stay behind and party with his best friend who is coming to town, LA hipster Sam Steele. Together, Buddy and Sam party, find girls, and consume an enormous amount of drugs. The next day we find out that Buddy has overdosed. He has died. And a strange girl called 911, we don't know who.

5000|$|All I Have {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. William Ruhlmann of AllMusic gave the album the grade {{of two and}} a half out of five stars, stating: [...] "The debut album by 22-year-old Amerie is basically a showcase for writer/producer Rich Harrison, who constructs a series of mid-tempo rhythm tracks and writes lyrics of romantic longing. Harrison's lack of originality is suggested by his inability even to come up with new song titles. Among the tracks here are newly written songs entitled [...] "Need You Tonight" [...] "Got to Be There" [...] and even [...] "I Just Died" [...] (that's right, [...] "in your arms"). Amerie has a pleasant-enough voice that she uses to express a tempered fervor and a degree of eroticism, but she seems to be just another modestly talented performer chosen mostly for her looks; record companies seem to be on an endless search for attractive young women of mixed racial heritage (apparently in hopes of demographic crossover) who can carry a tune, and this willing Georgetown graduate with a Korean mother and African-American father is just {{the latest in a long}} line. None of which is to say that she won't succeed (record companies make a lot of money taking such bets), but at least on the basis of her debut album, Amerie has nothing to recommend her beyond a fairly anonymous surface appeal." [...] Vanessa E. Jones of The Boston Globe gave a mixed review, stating: Amerie's almond eyes come courtesy of her Korean mother, while her caramel skin was inherited from her African-American dad. On her debut CD, All I Have, she proves that the melange makes a soulful combination. If there was a representative sound of the summer this year, it should have been the singer's shimmering single, [...] "Why Don't We Fall in Love". With jazzy horns and romantic strings caressed by Amerie's strong, yearning alto, the song brought to mind beach holidays and summer fun every time it came on the air. Amerie follows up that effort with a 12-song CD with several distinctive cuts. It would be a great debut if it weren't for all the filler, and for lyrics (written by the CD's producer Rich Harrison) that revolve around the tired subjects of love, betrayal, and hate. When Amerie fails to follow her instincts, the results can be disastrous. [...] "Float", for instance, finds her relying on histrionic yelling rather than crooning. But this is definitely a talent to watch, as the songs [...] "Can't Let Go", [...] "Talkin' to Me", [...] "Got to Be There" [...] and [...] "Why Don't We Fall in Love" [...] show." [...] Sarah Rodman of Boston Herald gave the album positive review with the grade of three out of four stars, stating: [...] "This 22-year-old Georgetown grad may be blessed with a lovely, flinty voice and great looks, but even she must have been shocked when her debut album, All I Have, made a Top 5 debut in Billboard. Amerie's music is two parts intriguing (a strong yet sultry R&B growl matched with the off-kilter hip-hop grooves of producer Rich Harrison) and one part run-of-the-mill (banal romance lyrics). There are tunes about Mr. Right, Mr. Right Now and Mr. Wrong. Amerie scores extra points for keeping things short, sweet and free from gratuitous vocal acrobatics. She stands out from the female R&B pack without resorting to affectation or gimmickry." [...] Steve Jones of USA Today gave the album {{two and a half}} out of four stars, stating: [...] "On her strings-laced hit single, [...] "Why Don't We Fall in Love", 22-year-old Amerie shows a talent for subtlety and nuance not often heard from a debut singer. The sultry vocalist lets the intensity build rather than relying on over-the-top flourishes. She shows her versatility with the jazzy [...] "Nothing Like Loving You", the edgy [...] "I Just Died" [...] and the infectious [...] "Talkin' to Me". While the material is not consistently strong, it serves as a nice introduction to a singer with great potential for growth." [...] Felicia Pride from PopMatters gave a mixed review, stating: [...] "I like Amerie. Not that she has much of an image, but she still seems like such a sweet and positive young woman. A Georgetown graduate, her humbleness exudes in interviews as she basks in her childhood dream with the giddiness of a schoolgirl. When her first single exploded, the world was introduced to her sitting on a park bench singing wholeheartedly those rhetorical words, [...] "Why don’t we fall in love?" [...] The hip-hop track with the defined R&B voice, championed upon the winning chemistry mastered by the likes of Mary J. Blige and Faith Evans. Naturally the anticipation was bubbling for her forthcoming All I Have. Even with all her charming characteristics, the brains, the voice and the looks, her debut is, well, boring. As I listened to the 12 tracks (11 if you dismiss the outro), I strained to find some spice, some personality. The tracks run into each other to the point that they become one very long song. The singular topic of love and relationships heightens its monotony, as does her lack of serious vocal experimentation. If you thought she sounded a little flat on [...] "Why Don’t We Fall in Love", prepare yourself for a few more out of range notes. The album is by no means Pretty Girl Who Can't Sing revisited. It is worth the space in your CD collection, and has some bright moments. In terms of mood, it’s very laid-back, with a rainy day or I-just-fell-in-love vibe, and one you can listen to at work. I must warn that you have already heard the most animated track on the album and probably more times than you would’ve liked as her first single was definitely killed by the radio. Her second single, [...] "Talkin’ to Me" [...] is cute, and a little catchy, but a little personality deficient. The songs that really carry the album are [...] "I Just Died" [...] and [...] "Show Me". Both are quiet storm ballads in which her vocals are richer, not as forced (quieter) and dance hand-in-hand with sexy hooks that allow the track to take the lead. The title track [...] "All I Have" [...] would have made a better second single as it shows the potential that Amerie has to explore the love ballad, the real meat and potatoes of the album. Props should go to Rich Harrison who is largely responsible for this project. He performed all the instruments, and wrote and produced all the songs except the outro. Besides being crazy talented, he is certainly a man in tune with his emotions, writing highly sensitive and female-perceptive lyrics perfect for any R&B diva. His tracks are simple yet artful and truly designed to let the singer define them. Unfortunately, this was not a consistent trend on All I Have because Amerie’s vocals were not always compelling enough to fittingly dominate the track. There were times when all was lost. For her first run, it might have been in the label’s best interest to employ a few hit makers. You know the ones that can make a hit for anyone despite their vocal capability. Not saying that Amerie is without, it just might have added a little pizzazz if she would have joined the Jermaine Dupri or even Darkchild roster list. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>that</b> is what remixes are for. In her bio, Amerie proudly (as she should be) describes her debut, [...] "The music and lyrics really put you into a zone. When Rich Harrison and I began creating the record, we knew that fusing beautiful melodies with hard, hip-hop beats would move people. I think we’ve accomplished that." [...] I only wish. Well maybe next time—and hopefully there will be another time. Her debut was respectable, simple and unpretentious. The ingredients are there, she just needs to perfect the mix." ...|$|E

Karski's poetry stands in constant dialogue with erotic treatment of body. He used weird, unpredictable associations.

Right now one of the big questions is there’s so much more CO 2 in the atmosphere than there was even 15  years ago, we don’t really know how much that’s changing. So we keep using what we knew about the system, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>that’s</b> not right anymore, because the undergirding assumptions are now no longer the case. Same with nitrogen availability… All our system understandings are based on measurements. The world is changing so rapidly that in many cases we need new data associated with those changes.” [...]...|$|R
5000|$|Cole {{described}} {{the songs on}} Rattlesnakes as [...] "about the things people do {{when they are in}} love. People get in all sorts of weird scenarios and I quite like the idea of that. I write about that more than anything. Sometimes it is comic, sometimes tragic, sometimes funny and tragic at the same time. After years of trying to deny it, Im also starting to realise that I basically write about myself." [...] He later reflected, [...] "Its like most of characters in the songs live in that same basement flat. Its very romanticised." [...] After the Commotions broke up, he would later admit to being embarrassed by some of his lyrics on Rattlesnakes: [...] "She looks like Eve Marie Saint/In On the Waterfront. Yes, some of the earlier lyrics were very naive. But I was a young man! I really was. You can just imagine me trying to wear a French trenchcoat at the time, thinking I looked very cool when, in fact, I looked really stupid. <b>But</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>thats</b> why people liked it." ...|$|R
