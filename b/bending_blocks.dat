40|$|A {{relatively}} simple, {{manually operated}} tool enables precise bending (typically, within 1 / 2 of the specified bend angle) of a metal tube {{located in a}} confined space, {{with a minimum of}} flattening of the tube and without significant gouging of the tube surface. The tool is designed for use in {{a situation in which the}} tube cannot be removed from the confined space for placement in a conventional benchmounted tube bender. The tool is also designed for use in a situation in which previously available hand-held tube benders do not afford the required precision, do not support the tube wall sufficiently to prevent flattening or gouging, and/or do not fit within the confined space. The tool is designed and fabricated for the specific outer diameter and bend radius of the tube to be bent. The tool (see figure) includes a clamping/radius block and a top clamping block that contain mating straight channels of semicircular cross section that fit snugly around the tube. The mating portions of the clamping/radius block and the top clamping block are clamped around a length of the tube that is adjacent to the bend and that is intended to remain straight. The clamping/radius block is so named because beyond the straight clamping section, its semicircular channel extends to a non-clamping section that is curved at the specified bend radius. A pivot hole is located in the clamping/radius block at the center of the bend circle. The tool includes a <b>bending</b> <b>block</b> that, like the other blocks, contains a straight semicircular channel that fits around the outside of the tube. The <b>bending</b> <b>block</b> contains a pivot hole to be aligned with the pivot hole in the clamping/radius block. Once the tube has been clamped between the clamping/ radius and top clamping <b>blocks,</b> the <b>bending</b> <b>block</b> is placed around the tube, the pivot holes are aligned, and a pivot pin is inserted through the pivot holes...|$|R

50|$|The {{next most}} {{important}} innovation was C.F. Theodore Steinway's rim <b>bending</b> <b>block</b> patent of 1880, {{which is still}} used in every grand piano all over the world: long thin strips of sawn wood are glued together and clamped on a wing-shaped fixture with screwed pressing bars. The previous method of casemaking for grands was much more expensive and time consuming: it demanded the fitting together of wooden corner pieces {{and in particular the}} right-hand wall bent by steam into an S curve. The steam bending process required very experienced workers, and a high proportion of the bent pieces had to be rejected. So C.F. Theodore Steinway's invention, which glued together thin saw-cut sheets was very economical: it permitted more cases to be made in a shorter time, with less loss of wood which had already been expensively dried over a period of years.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} calculation for modelling of the stressstrain {{relationship in the}} case of block loads with mean load value. A model, based on the stable hysteresis loops, was assumed and modified to use for block loading analysis. For stress history calculation, the proposed model and two other constitutive models were used. Results of fatigue test of specimens made of S 355 J 0 steel subjected to <b>bending</b> <b>block</b> loading with mean load value are presented and used to verify the proposed model. In the tests, the mean load was increased and decreased in subsequent blocks. The changes of strain recorded during the tests shown in the paper indicate a different behavior of the material. Damage accumulation degree for block sequence was used to compare the results of calculations. It was shown, that stress history parameters (stress amplitude and mean stress value in this case) are similar for all investigated model...|$|R

40|$|International audienceFrom field {{observations}} it {{is possible}} to establish correlations between geological conditions and landslide occurrence. However, in general, it is difficult to assess the affect of individual factors on slope instability because of their mutual interaction. In addition, the dynamic effect of propagating seismic waves significantly increases the complexity of the slope stability problem. Wave diffraction, reflection and focusing effects are dependent on local geological conditions and make it difficult to analyse dynamic sliding mechanisms using field observations alone. As a consequence, in order to examine the influence of various geological and seismic factors on slope movements, it is often necessary to produce numerical models. This paper describes the results of such models as applied to two case studies in Kyrgyzstan: the Ananevo rockslide, located in granite, and the Suusamyr debris slump-flow, situated within soft sediments (see Part A: Havenith et al., 2003). Discrete element modelling (UDEC), adapted both to the discontinuous character of fractured rock and to the heterogeneity of layered mediums, was used. This permitted simulation of deformation mechanisms, including seismically induced <b>bending,</b> <b>block</b> tilting, and slip. Particular attention was paid to the interaction between deformation mechanisms, site-specific amplification effects, and subsurface structure...|$|R
40|$|The {{stress-strain}} relationship of biological soft tissues affected by Marfan 2 ̆ 7 s syndrome {{is believed to}} be nonconvex. More specifically, Haughton and Merodio recently proposed a strain energy density leading to localized strain-softening, in order to model the unusual mechanical behavior of these isotropic, incompressible tissues. Here we investigate how this choice of strain energy affects the results of some instabilities studies, such as those concerned with the compression of infinite and semi-infinite solids, slabs, and cylinders, or with the <b>bending</b> of <b>blocks,</b> and draw comparisons with known results established previously for the case of a classical neo-Hookean solid. We find that the localized strain-softening effect leads to early instability only when instability occurs at severe compression ratios for neo-Hookean solids, as is the case for bulk, surface, and bending instabilities.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} SoundStrand, a novel tangible interface for composing music. A {{new paradigm}} is also presented - one {{that allows for}} music composition with limited degrees of freedom, and therefore is well suited for music creation {{through the use of}} tangible interfaces. SoundStrand is comprised of a set of building blocks that represent pre-composed musical segments. By sequentially connecting building blocks to one another, the user arranges these segments into a musical theme; and by individually twisting, stretching and <b>bending</b> the <b>blocks,</b> variations of the melodic, harmonic and rhythmic content are introduced. Software tools are made available to program the musical segments and govern SoundStrand's behavior. Additional work, namely the Coda system, is presented in order to put SoundStrand and the described paradigm in a wider context as tools for music sharing and learning. by Eyal Shahar. Thesis (S. M.)

50|$|As {{the fault}} grows upward, it {{cuts through the}} newly formed {{sedimentary}} layers at the top. Therefore, the overall displacement along the fault plane is not the same. Further, the lowermost layer has higher displacement than the uppermost layer while the intermediate layer displacement lies in between (fig. 2). Because the fault plane flattens into décollement, the downthrown block moves basinward and the displaced sedimentary layer of the downthrown <b>block</b> <b>bends</b> close to the fault plane forming rollover anticline, synthetic and antithetic faults. Figure 3 is an E-W seismic line at Svalbard area showing footwall, hanging wall and the geometry of sedimentary layers around the fault plane.|$|R
40|$|In {{southern}} Europe and {{the western}} Mediterranean, Permo-Carboniferous magmatism is well represented in areas of Iberia, the Alps, Sardinia and the Balkan Peninsula. In Iberia, the magmatism that has been related to the Variscan orogeny is associated with syn-orogenic events at ca. 350 - 315 Ma and post-orogenic at ca. 310 - 295 Ma. In the southern Pyrenees there is Permo-Carboniferous sedimentary basins with a significant volume of rhyolitic ignimbrites and andesitic flows. The Erill Castell-Estac, Cadí and Castellar de n’Hug basins are spatially associated with the Boí, Montellá and Vielha granites and the Cardet dacitic dykes emplaced in Variscan basement rocks. U-Pb SHRIMP dating of zircons extracted from these granites, an andesitic flow, a dacitic dyke and six ignimbrites, revealed that magmatism was active from ca. 304 Ma to ca. 266 Ma. The scattering of zircon ages in each sample shows {{that the history of}} melt crystallization was prolonged and complex. The reported ages of the magmatic activity for the Southern Pyrenees in the range ca. 304 - 283 Ma (this study) fit in well with the time interval of magmatism related to the early North-dipping subduction of the Western Paleotethys Ocean, the subsequent development of Iberian orocline (Variscan cycle), and the large-scale <b>bending</b> and <b>blocking</b> of the Paleotethys Ocean subduction at East of Iberia. In paleogeographic reconstructions of the Permo-Carboniferous, Iberia is located in the core of Pangaea to the east of the probable Rheic Ocean suture and near the western end of the subduction zone of the Paleotethys Ocean. The emplacement in Iberia of granites with ca. 310 - 278 Ma age occurred after the collision of Laurussia and Gondwana, when the subduction of the Rheic Ocean was inactive. From a Variscan-cycle perspective, the Permo-Carboniferous magmatism of the Pyrenees has been considered as post-orogenic. However, global paleogeographic reconstructions put Iberia in between the Rheic Ocean suture and the still active subduction zone of the Western Paleotethys Ocean. Therefore, the Permo-Carboniferous magmatism of Iberia, from a Cimmerian-cycle perspective, may have accompanied the closing of the Paleotethys Ocean. During this stage of the evolution of Pangaea, the east of Iberia was geologically affected by the active subduction zone of the Paleotethys Ocean. The period ca. 310 - 285 Ma is marked by the development of an orocline that extends from Iberia to Armorica. The northwards subduction of the western corner of Paleotethys probably caused orocline formation and consequent large-scale <b>bending</b> and <b>blocking</b> of Paleotethys subduction immediately east of Iberia. The Permo-Carboniferous magmatism of Iberia, coeval with this tectonic evolution, shows a mixed imprint of subduction and delamination geochemical signatures. Although this may seem controversial, in our view the magmatic activity preserved in the Southern Pyrenees could provide the missing link between the development of the Iberian orocline and the continued subduction of easternmost segments of the Paleotethys Ocean (Cimmerian cycle) during the evolution of Pangaea...|$|R
40|$|The New England Orogen {{in eastern}} Australia {{exhibits}} an oroclinal structure, but its geometry and geodynamic evolution are controversial. Here we present new {{data from the}} southernmost part of the oroclinal structure, the Manning Orocline, which supposedly developed in the Early Permian, contemporaneously and/or shortly after the deposition of the Lower Permian Manning Basin. New U-Pb detrital zircon data provide a maximum depositional age of ~ 288 [*]Ma. Structural evidence from rocks of the Manning Basin indicates that both bedding and preoroclinal fold axial planes are approximately oriented parallel to the trace of the Manning Orocline. Brittle deformation was dominated by sinistral strike-slip faulting, particularly along a major fault zone (Peel-Manning Fault System), which is marked by the occurrence of a serpentinitic mélange, and separates tectonostratigraphic units of the New England Orogen. Our revised geological map shows that the Manning Basin is bounded by faults and serpentinites, thus indicating that basin formation was intimately linked to deformation along the Peel-Manning Fault System. The Manning Basin is thus interpreted to be a transtensional pull-apart basin associated with the Peel-Manning Fault System. Age constraints and structural relationships indicate that basin formation likely occurred during the incipient stage of oroclinal <b>bending,</b> with <b>block</b> rotations and fragmentation of the transtensional pull-apart system occurring subsequently. The intimate link between oroclinal bending and basin formation in the New England oroclines indicates that back-arc extension, accompanied by transtensional deformation, could have {{played an important role}} in the early stage of orocline development...|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the new couplets was {{completed}} {{during the summer of}} 1991. The new southbound couplet to Jackson Street was completed the following year in 1992 and begins north of 'C' Street. It eliminated a former service station at the northwest corner of 'C' and Main, which had been converted to other retail for over a decade. The critical couplet {{at the south end of}} the city was delayed several times for various reasons. Completed in 2000, it is two blocks south and one block east of the 1981 divider at 8th Street. After Sweet Avenue, northbound Main Street <b>bends</b> a <b>block</b> east to align with northbound one-way Washington Street, intersecting the two-way Troy Highway from the southeast. Southbound US 95 traffic joins the intersection from the northwest, arriving on a one-way diagonal from Jackson Street. Agricultural buildings on the block between Jackson and Main (College St. to Lewis St.) were razed in the late 1990s to complete this new corridor. Another significant change to local commerce was the increase of the state's legal drinking age to 21 in April 1987, after nearly fifteen years at age 19. Many establishments that relied on revenues from 19- and 20-year-olds from the two university communities had to adjust or cease operations. Prior to the lowering to 19 in July 1972, the drinking age in Idaho was 20 for beer and 21 for liquor and wine.|$|R

The experiment was installed at county of Sao Sebastiao, state of Alagoas, Brazil, on the soil Dystrophic Agrey Argissoil cropped to sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). The experimental design was <b>bend</b> in randomized <b>blocks</b> in 5 x 2 factorial scheme with five siderurgical slag doses: 0, 2. 5, 5. 0, 10. 0 and 15. 0 t ha- 1, five irrigation depth 14. 1; 9. 5; 5. 2; 2. 3 e 0. 0 mm h- 1 and four replications.

40|$|A {{mesoscale}} {{atmospheric model}} {{is used to}} address the characteristics of stratified flow bounded by a side wall along a varying coastline. Initial Froude number values are varied through alteration of marine inversion strength, permitting examination of supercritical, subcritical, and transcritical flow regimes encountering several coastal configurations. Consistent with shallow water models, sharp drops in boundary layer depth and flow acceleration occur in flow rounding convex bends; however, significant flow response occurs in the stratified layer aloft, which is unexplained by conventional shallow water theory. The strongest flow acceleration occurs in the transcritical case while, regardless of inversion strength, the deformation of the isentropes aloft shows general structural similarity. Advection of horizontal momentum {{is an important component}} of the horizontal force balance. A simulation having several coastline bends exhibits a detached, oblique hydraulic jump upwind of a concave <b>bend</b> that strongly <b>blocks</b> the flow. For the single-bend case, a shallow water similarity theory for stratified flow provides qualitative, and partial quantitative, agreement with the mesoscale model, in the boundary layer and aloft. Horizontal structure functions for these similarity solutions satisfy a set of equivalent shallow water equations. This comparison provides a new perspective on previous shallow water models of supercritical flow around coastal bends and suggests that the existence of the supercritical flow response may depend more on the presence of a low-level jet than on a sharp boundary layer inversion...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} {{reported on the}} fabrication and displacement output of electroactive polymer (EAP) microactuators less than 1 mm in length. The main limiting factor hindering their further miniaturization and their displacement output was {{the thickness of the}} commercially available polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane used (∼ 110 μm). In this study, we have reduced the thickness of the PVDF layer using a spin-coating technique and then electrochemically deposited polypyrrole layers {{on both sides of this}} thin film to make ultrathin-film EAP substrates with a thickness of 48 μm. We then employed a laser ablation technique to fabricate microsized EAP actuators as small as 200 μm in length and 50 μm in width that can operate in both dry and aqueous media. This is the minimum-size EAP microactuator to be reported in the literature. Based on the operation principle of these actuators, we model them as a microcantilever beam under a uniformly distributed load. We then establish <b>bending</b> displacement and <b>blocking</b> force models to perform the following: 1) to estimate the actuation force, actuationmoment, tip deflection, flexural rigidity, and strain energies per unit volume and mass for a set of microactuators as big as 850 μm × 250 μm × 126 μm and as small as 200 μm × 50 μm × 48 μm and 2) to evaluate their performance metrics...|$|R
40|$|The active channel–levee {{system of}} the middle Bengal Fan was studied by a {{combined}} analysis of Parasound echosounder and Hydrosweep swathsounder data. The channel is characterized by highly variable sinuosities. Compared to other mud-rich submarine fans, an exceptionally low channel slope is found. The system can be subdivided into inner and outer zones of significantly different depositional architecture. The inner zone consists of the active channel and sharply separated vertical blocks, which are characterized by parallel, distinct reflectors and planforms of <b>bends.</b> These <b>blocks</b> are interpreted as abandoned channel segments (cut-off loops). The outer zones represent undisturbed levees, which are constructed of parallel and wedge-shaped sedimentary units. The wedge-shaped units, varying significantly in thickness and lateral extent, are found at the outer convex arcs of active and abandoned channel loops caused by overspilling of channelized turbidity currents at sharp bends. The parallel units are the deposits of turbidity currents, which spread their sediments over wide areas as their size significantly exceeds the cross-section of the channel. The complex vertical and horizontal distribution of partially small sedimentary units suggests a more complicated deposition {{in time and space}} as hitherto reported from other submarine fans. Within the inner zone, more than 20 cut-off loops were identified over a channel length of 90 km. In contrast to most other large mud-rich submarine fans, channel avulsion within the active channel–levee system is a frequent process. In particular, a temporal succession of at least 4 cut-off loops was reconstructed in the southern study area, indicating channel avulsion on average every 750 years. Channel avulsion seems to be a repetitious process caused by erosion through turbidite currents in a highly sinuous channel. Compared to other submarine fans, no morphological parameter shows a remarkable difference except the channel slope, which is significantly smaller than, for example, on Amazon, Congo and Mississippi fans. The interaction between this low channel slope and the flow parameter of the turbidity currents is most likely the reason for the instability of the active channel planform, leading to an exceptionally large number of meander loop breaches and cut-off loops...|$|R
5000|$|During the two-part episode [...] "The Day of Black Sun", Aang assembles {{an elite}} {{invasion}} force and attacks the Fire Nation capital, {{taking advantage of}} an eclipse that rendered the firebenders powerless. Having gained knowledge of the invasion during her infiltration in the Earth Kingdom, Azula warned the Fire Lord and evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion. Azula and her agents stall Aang and his friends Sokka and Toph from finding Fire Lord Ozai before the eclipse, lasting only eight minutes, allowing the Fire Nation to retaliate with full force once they regained control over their bending abilities, causing the invasion to fail. Later, Azula, accompanied by Mai and Ty Lee, head to The Boiling Rock, the top security Fire Nation prison, where Zuko has been captured {{in an attempt to}} infiltrate the prison and rescue the captured forces of the failed invasion; but Zuko, Sokka, Suki (leader of the Kyoshi Warriors, who had been captured in the aftermath of their battle with Azula), and Sokka's father Hakoda escape. Mai betrays Azula, by aiding the group in escaping, and proclaims that she did so out of her love for Zuko, and the latter attempts to attack Mai, but is stopped by Ty Lee, who renders Azula incapable of <b>bending</b> by <b>blocking</b> her Chi (the energy within one which one would use for bending). After having Mai and Ty Lee confined, Azula leads a platoon to the Western Air Temple, where she contends with Zuko. In the finale, Ozai marks Azula his successor as Fire Lord; but soon afterward, Azula sinks into psychosis and deposes nearly all of her servants and advisers. Before she is crowned, Zuko and Katara interrupt the ceremony, whereupon Azula challenges Zuko to single combat in an Agni Kai. However, her attacks, while powerful, are wild and emotional while Zuko's are calm and disciplined; and when his attacks begin to overpower her, Azula sends a bolt of lightning towards Katara, but ends up striking down Zuko who attempted to redirect it. She is ultimately defeated by Katara who takes her captive via Waterbending. Following the end of the war, Azula is admitted to a psychiatric institution due to her mental breakdown, where she is closely monitored.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the manufacture of}} thin shells for the deformable secondary mirrors of the LBT adaptive optics system. The secondary mirrors are thin shells, 910 mm in diameter and 1. 6 mm thick. Each mirror will have its shape controlled by 672 voice-coil actuators. The main requirement for manufacture of the shell is smoothness on scales {{too small to be}} adjusted by the actuators. An additional requirement is that the rear surface match the reference body within 30 µm peak-to-valley. A technique was developed for producing smooth surfaces on the very aspheric surfaces of the shells. We figure the optical surfaces on a thick disk of Zerodur, then turn the disk over and thin it to 1. 6 mm from the rear surface. Figuring is done primarily with a 30 cm diameter stressed lap, which bends actively to match the local curvature of the aspheric surface. For the thinning operation, the mirror is blocked with pitch, optical surface down, onto a granite disk with a matching convex surface. Because the shell may <b>bend</b> during the <b>blocking</b> operation and as its thickness is reduced to 1. 6 mm, figuring of the rear surface is guided by precise thickness measurements over the surface of the shell. This method guarantees that both surfaces of the finished shell will satisfy their requirements when corrected with small actuator forces. Following the thinning operation, we edge the shell to its final dimensions, remove it from the blocking body, and coat the rear surface with aluminum to provide a set of conductive plates for capacitive sensors...|$|R
40|$|Only about 15 {{million years}} of Pacific-Australia motion {{is needed to}} {{reconstruct}} {{the two halves of}} the Permian Maitai terrane {{on either side of the}} Alpine Fault, the current plate boundary. Most Early Miocene and earlier reconstructions of New Zealand ignore the misfit that arises from keeping the Alpine Fault as the plate boundary before 15 Ma. The new reconstruction developed here removes this inconsistency by postulating the operation of a different transcurrent-fault system during the Early to Middle Miocene, running west of the Marlborough Sounds Block and east of the Fiordland Block (the Fiordland Fault System). Transfer of the the locus of transcurrent motion from the Fiordland Fault System to the Alpine Fault was a response to a mid-Miocene change in Pacific-Australia motion, and arose by a process analogous to the Pliocene to present adjustment of the Alpine Fault to the Pliocene change in Pacific-Australia motion. In both cases the change in motion increased convergence on the transcurrent system, and resulted in bending of the active transcurrent fault and propagation of new faults aligned with the new motion vector. Growth of the bends in both the Alpine Fault and the Fiordland Fault System can be explained by the contrast between deformation restricted to the Pacific Plate south of the bends, and shared between both plates near the bends. Restoration back to 9. 5 Ma reconstructs the elements of the Fiordland Fault System as collinear, except for a bend in the Waimea Fault, west of the Marlborough Sounds <b>Block.</b> <b>Bending</b> of the Waimea Fault occurred during the Middle Miocene and is associated with compression in northwest Nelson. Transcurrent motion on the Fiordland Fault System allows reconstruction back to between 25 and 20 Ma, when a shift in the position of the Pacific-Australia motion pole initiated significant rates of lateral displacement within New Zealand...|$|R
40|$|In certain {{parameter}} regimes, {{steady flow}} through flexible tubes is unstable to self-excited oscillations. Whittaker et al. (2010, Proc. Roy. Soc. A 466) solved an asymptotic {{model for the}} onset of self-excited oscillations in a long, thin-walled,flexible tube clamped between two rigid tubes, with a large axial tension. This work neglected effects such as wall inertia, axial bending, and in-plane shear forces. Whittaker (2015, IMA J. Appl. Math.) reintroduced in-plane shearing and found a shear-relaxation boundary layer at the tube ends. In this thesis,wall inertia and axial bending are reintroduced into these models. In Chapter 2, wall inertia terms {{are added to the}} governing equations for the wall mechanics, and a new ‘tube law’ describing the wall motion is derived. Combining this with a description of the fluid mechanics, the effect of wall inertia on the oscillations is quantified. Wall inertia is found to be a destabilising effect. In Chapters 3 – 7, axial bending is reintroduced allowing ‘clamped’ boundaryconditions to be satisfied at the tube ends. Three different regimes dependent on the dimensionless length and wall thickness of the tube are found. Chapters 4 – 5 concentrate on the two regimes where the shear layer found by Whittaker (2015) must be considered. An axial bending boundary layer that induces higher-order corrections to the shear layer and bulk solution is found in these regimes. In Chapters 6 – 7, a final regime is considered where the shear layer no longer needs consideration, but a new model for the wall mechanics is needed. Deriving and solving a linearised 2 D model for <b>bending</b> a semi-infinite <b>block</b> under tension, corresponding to a 2 D cross-section of the tube wall, a new transverse shear-relaxation layer is found. This boundary layer allows clamped boundary conditions to be satisfied and induces higher-order corrections to the bulk solution...|$|R
40|$|In {{many cases}} the {{capacity}} of composite slabs with profiled steel sheeting depends on the shear resistance at the sheet-concrete interface. This shear resistance {{is essential to the}} interaction between the steel sheeting and the concrete. Besides this, other factors also affect the behaviour of composite slabs. The first aim {{of this study is to}} find an effective method to measure the shear resistance at the concrete-sheet interface. Secondly, it aims to study the influence of different parameters on the load bearing capacity and behaviour of composite slabs without performing a large number of full-scale tests. The behaviour of composite slabs was investigated experimentally. A small-scale test, the concrete <b>block</b> <b>bending</b> test, was developed to measure the shear resistance at the concrete-sheet interface. The obtained shear flow-slip relation was then used in a numerical simulation using the finite element method. Moreover, six full-scale composite slabs with profiled steel sheet PEVA 45 were tested to determine the shear capacity of the slabs. The test results were evaluated according to the Swedish code and were used for comparison with the results from numerical simulations. A two-dimensional finite element model was used to study the behaviour of one-way composite slabs. It was found that the concrete strength only slightly affected the capacity of the slabs. The horizontal shear resistance at the sheet-concrete interface and the strength of the steel sheet were the most important factors. It was also found that the actual influence of horizontal shear resistance and the strength of the steel sheet depended on the failure modes of the slabs. Comparatively, the resistance for vertical separation had little effect and the influence can be neglected in the analysis. The behaviour of two-way composite slabs which were simply supported at four edges were investigated by a three-dimensional finite element model. It was found that the load transferred in two directions depended on a span to span ratio of the slabs. Compared with one-way slabs, two-way composite slabs had the advantages of a small deflection, a small end-slip and a high capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of a graben has been investigated using finite element analysis. A new method of modelling faults has been developed {{which is based on}} calculating the shear stresses on the fault and, if they exceed the frictional strength, applying forces which cause frictional sliding. Both Newtonian visco - elastic and power law creep rheologies have been used for the lower lithosphere. The deformation patterns seen in the models are relatively insensitive to which one is used. Stress amplification is shown to result in normal faulting in the upper, brittle layer as a result of relatively small stresses of about 20 MPa being applied throughout the depth of the lithosphere. When a fault is introduced into the model the stresses adjacent to the fault are re-orientated and secondary faulting is predicted. The bending profile associated with the fault deformation results in a weakness where the stresses are most greatly modified. A second normal fault may form here. I f the fault movement is confined to {{the upper part of the}} brittle layer then the predicted graben width is between 5 and 15 km. For deeper fault movement and an underlying fluid the predicted width increases to 50 - 55 km. A more realistic theology for the underlying material is visco - elasticity. In this case the predicted width is about 25 km. The fault throw increases as the visco - elastic material relaxes but no significant change is seen in the width. The subsidence of a 50 km wide graben wedge has been examined. For applied stresses of about 50 MPa and coefficients of friction of less than about 0. 1, subsidence of about 1 km is predicted. This does not include sediment in filling. The subsiding wedge causes large compressive stresses in the underlying material which may be long - lasting. The subsidence is controlled by the boundary faults and causes <b>bending</b> of the <b>block</b> which may result in internal deformatio...|$|R

The investigation was conducted through a comprehensive literature review, an industry survey to establish current use and preferences, a Delphi survey with experts to establish actual advantages and disadvantages, scale model testing to establish some fundamental knowledge of tension to deflection relationship, and finally a series of targeted case studies to establish both productivity and skyline tension in actual operations. Each of these aspects of the research topic employed different methodology. The literature review highlighted the most relevant research relating to cable logging world-wide spanning nearly a century. Various research papers, manuals, books and computer software were summarized. While many aspects of cable yarding operations have been investigated, much of it focusing on various aspects of operational efficiency through case studies, there is very limited information with regard to rigging configurations. The survey of 50 cable logging practitioners determined what rigging configurations were commonly used in New Zealand. It includes their perceived advantages and disadvantages for varying levels of deflection, but also for specific scenarios such as pulling away from native forest boundaries and flying logs over a stream. Results showed that there were many conflicting perceptions about rigging configuration options. Using an expert panel, a Delphi process was used to derive consensus on what advantages were truly unique to each configuration. This allowed the longer lists of perceived advantages from the industry survey to be pared down to a concise list of ad/disadvantages that will be used in the updating of the Best Practice Guidelines for Cable Logging. To increase our fundamental understanding of tension / payload / deflection relationships, an experiment was conducted in a controlled environment. Using a model yarder in a lab and continuous tension and video recording devices, the dynamic skyline behavior of three similar configurations were tested: North Bend, South <b>Bend</b> and <b>Block</b> in the Bight. The tensions were compared by use of a two-way analysis of variance, which indicated configuration and choker length were significant variables in some but not all of the dynamic load tests. Results also showed that some configurations performed better than others in minimizing the shock loads due to dropping into full suspension, impact with ground objects, and breakout during bridling. Finally, a series of eight studies were conducted on targeted logging operations where relevant stand and terrain parameters were related to the continuous skyline tension monitoring, and recording of productivity through time study. The three targeted configurations included (1) North Bend, (2) Standing skyline using a motorized slack-pulling carriage and (3) a live skyline using a motorized grapple carriage. Results showed that peak and average tensions, as well as amplification factors and the payload to tension relationship, varied between configurations. The study also showed that tensions could be collected to compute measures of payload and tension efficiency, which provided insight into operational performance. The safe working load was exceeded in 53 % of all cycles studied and across seven of eight study sites and 14 of 16 spans. Cycle times were significantly different between rigging configurations and that production information could be used to compute measures of labor and energy consumption as well as payload and tension efficiency; which also provide insight into operational performance. The industry should give serious consideration to the use of tension monitors. Tension monitors have many benefits and have the potential to improve cable logging operations in New Zealand. Monitoring tensions can help one learn new techniques or methods (i. e. rigging configurations), help improve payload analysis software for future planning and help evaluate new technology and machinery...|$|R
40|$|Multiphase flows {{occurring}} in pipelines with a serpentine configuration {{is an important}} phenomenon, which can be encountered in heat exchangers used {{in a variety of}} industrial processes. More specifically, in many industrial units such as a large cracking furnace in a refinery, the tubes are arranged in a serpentine manner and are relatively short. As flow negotiates round the 180 o bend at the ends of the tubes, the generated centrifugal force could cause flow maldistribution creating local dry spots, where no steady liquid film is formed on the adjacent straight sections of the pipe. As a result, events including coking, cracking and overheating of heat transfer surfaces may occur and lead to frequent shutdown of the facilities. Consequently, this could increase operating costs and reduce production revenue. Thus, it is desirable to know the effect that the bends exert on the flow in the straight part of the pipe. Apart from this, knowledge of the bend effects on the flows in the pipeline could also be important for the design of other pipelines for gas/liquid transport, e. g. offshore gas and oil pipelines. Quite a large number of studies have been found in the literature. The majority of them were for two-phase flow with small diameter pipes (i. d. ≤ 50 mm). However, studies with large diameter pipes (i. d. ≥ 100 mm), have increasingly been considered in recent years as problems related to large diameter vertical pipes are being encountered more and more often in industrial situations. This thesis studies the effect of 180 o bends on the characteristics and development of gas-liquid two-phase flows in large diameter downward and upward pipes. The study particularly focuses on the influence of serpentine configuration on flow structure, cross-sectional void distribution and circumferential liquid film profiles and their development along the downward and upward sections. It was found that both the top and bottom bends have considerable impacts on flow behaviour, although to varying degrees. These impacts were highly dependent on the air and water flow rates. For sufficient flow rates, the bends were observed to create flow maldistribution in the adjacent straight section, due to the effects of centrifugal force. The air moved towards the inner zone of the bend and the water towards the outer zone, while a lesser quantity of water was identified on the other surfaces of the pipe. Investigation of the film thickness development in the downward and upward sections showed that, the liquid film behaviour close to the bends was significantly different from those located further away. This {{can be attributed to the}} centrifugal force of the bends. Examination of the power spectral density (PSD) along the downward and upward sections showed that, the shape of PSD located in the adjacent section to the bends, was substantially different from those located further away. Furthermore, several flow regime maps were generated which showed that, in addition to bubbly, intermittent and annular flows, unstable flows existed along the upward section, particularly for low gas and water flow rates. In this study it was found that, the lower <b>bend</b> was periodically <b>blocked</b> by the liquid and then blown through by the accumulated air. The data obtained from this study were compared with different theoretical correlations found in the existing literature. Some discrepancy between the results of the current study and those of previous published materials was noted. Updated correlations were presented which provided well results when they applied for the data obtained from the current study and previous studies...|$|R
40|$|R. temporaria and R. arvalis are {{widespread}} species, {{and their}} sympatry zone extends for some 4000 kilometers from {{west to east}} and in the widest part along meridian 33 º east longitude about 2000 kilometers. The distinction in the physiology of hibernation {{and the nature of}} their winter shelters between R. temporaria and R. arvalis is principial. The common frog, as a kind of a potential water-hibernator, can remain in the terrestrial shelters where a local climate permits. Moor frog which is capable to cope with body freezing is a potential land hibernator, but certain situations make it spend winter under water. Both species can use bogs as wintering shelters. Strategy of R. temporaria spawning was formed in the conditions of small river basins not exposed to vast floods, with the accompanying streams-tributaries, inlets, flow-through lakes, oxbows, potholes, etc. Breeding behavior of frogs consists in forming a «mat» or «cushion» of the spawn clumps, which prevent their drifting towards deep water. In contrast, the «core» breeding habitat of R. arvalis is flat lowland areas with a non-static level of shallow water. Scattered oviposition of this frog significantly increases the chances of larvae to complete their development in isolated pools and ponds remaining after drying shallow water areas. The congestion of clutches can occur only at a high density of breeding specimens of the moor frog in some circumstances. In fact, this is only a reduction to the minimum the distance between males, but not a desire of animals to aggregate. In favorable conditions and living side by side, R. temporaria and R. arvalis have always some extent overlap of spawning habitats, and they can spawn close to each other. Common frog is a mobile and terrestrial species. Therefore it occupies the wide range of summer foraging habitats in the area having a certain landscape. Usually, this is a variety of forest habitats, scrubs and nearby meadow areas, rocky tundra, and marshy runoff beds covered with shrubbery or uneven scrub mires. Summer habitats of R. arvalis are primarily open or semi-open landscape faces, often soggy. In European mountains, R. temporaria is known to occur up to 2750 m above sea level, and in the south it does not come down to the lowlands. R. arvalis usually avoids areas located above 500 – 600 m, and they are rarely found at the height exceeding 900 m a. s. l. However, in the mountains of Southern Siberia populations of this species are common at altitudes up to 1800 m a. s. l., and the documented upper limit is 2400 m a. s. l. The causes of such differences in vertical distribution of the species are fundamental differences in the geomorphological properties of the landscape of mountainous regions of Europe and Asia. All european mountains (Pyrenees, Alps, Carpathians, Scandinavia and the mountains of the Balkan Peninsula), including the Urals, are mostly folded structures that arose in the process of deformation (folds and thrust faults) of the Earth crust in its horizontal motions. A less important role play blocky and arched uplifts, which are expressed only in the relief of midlands and lowlands of Central Europe (Slate Mountains, Schwarzwald, Bohemian Massif, etc.), stretching between the Central European plain and the systems of the Alps and Western Carpathians. Mountain systems are linearly elongated, dissected by weakly developed river valleys, which are narrow and steep-sided. These mountains do not have any large horizontal troughs, and the width of sloping valleys is less than a few kilometers everywhere. The bottoms of the valleys are seldom flat over large areas. Midlands and lowlands have the character of erosion dissected plateaus with narrow canyons. In contrast to the mountain areas in Europe, in Siberia {{we have to deal with}} the compound such as single mountain zone countries (Altai, Sayany, Baikal, Aldan). In the formation of the belt which stretches almost 3. 500 kilometers arched and arched-block lifting plays the main role. In this case, the vast areas of the Earth crust experienced <b>bending,</b> followed by <b>block</b> division. Raised relict surfaces of alignment occupy areas on the flat hilly plains, uplands and tablelands, and form the bottom of the intermountain basins. Numerous valleys and hollows of South Siberian mountain belt sometimes so extensive, that separated highlands, ridges, river valleys with alluvium exist within them. Populations of R. temporaria in the European mountains are confined to the wooded valleys with rivers and streams running through them, to the shores of lakes in all altitudinal belts. In such circumstances, R. arvalis is deprived of its «core» landscape — flat marshy areas with stagnant water that impedes the penetration of this species to a mountainous terrain. In the mountains of Southern Siberia, uplifted hilly plains and plateaus are abundantly watered due to climatic conditions and water-physical properties of crumbly sediments. They are favorable for wide distribution of diverse bogs. Viable populations of R. arvalis inhabit all the altitudinal belts of mountain areas in Siberia where there are spacious and level surfaces: from waterlogged floodplains (Vitim river) to alpine tundra (Altai Mts.) The distribution of R. temporaria, the European species, everywhere in the area is associated with the landscapes, which are characterized by a pronounced micro- or mesorelief. The presence of small permanent and temporary streams and lakes with renewed water is necessary. Various small ponds usually present as well. General features of the relief does not permit significant overflows and floods of rivers and lake-river systems (areas affected by extensive flooding are avoided by the species categorically). Small marshes of eutrophic-mesotrophic series and the areas of wetlands are often present (in vast marshy terrains this frog does not occur). Spawning takes place in different riparian ponds, as well as in closed, relatively deep, temporary and permanent water bodies with similar hydrological regime, sometimes at a large distance from their hibernation sites. Obvious «outposts» of R. temporaria distribution are mountains. Of geographic range for some 15 thousand kilometers, if it is outlined on the extreme points of findings this species on the mainland, one half falls on the mountain massifs. As for the habitats of R. arvalis, the Europaean and Siberian species, a fundamentally different morphology of the landscape is inherent. This is a kind of flat and concave mesoforms and hydromorphic areas of the smooth relief with stagnant ponds. In any terrain, species demonstrates stronger preference for marshy landscape tracts, flooded areas of river valleys, reed quaking bogs, raw moorlands, and other wetlands. In different geographical conditions, such tract may be narrowed to the rim along the shores of lakes and rivers drying up in the steppe zone and in coastal meadows in northern Europe, or it dominates in the landscape either in Western Siberia or on the flat tundra in the North. In the landscape tracts inhabited by this species, tree or shrub vegetation rarely presents. The appearance of moor frogs in some «dry» forested habitats is probably caused by the presence of marshy areas nearby. Wintering, spawning and fattening of R. arvalis often occur in the same biotope and the year around. It is only where there is the interpenetration of «core» landscapes of each species (large areas of the northern and western parts of the East European Plain, and a part of the West Siberian Plain contiguous to the Urals), one can observe the examples of real sympatry of R. arvalis and R. temporaria...|$|R
