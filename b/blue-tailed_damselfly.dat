5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Ischnura elegans) nymph, {{showing the}} three tail {{appendages}} ...|$|E
50|$|It {{includes}} a sculpture trail and Pluck Lake, {{a refuge for}} <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> and the emperor dragonfly.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blue-tailed</b> <b>Damselflies</b> are superb fliers and {{can alter}} {{each of their}} four wing's {{kinematics}} in order to maneuver. A recent study has shown that they can compensate for a whole wing loss and even successfully maneuver and catch prey ...|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} a small damselfly, 35 mm long, {{predominantly}} black with iridescent blue markings. The male resembles <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselflies</b> (Ischnura species) but is distinguished by its large, spaced eyes that are a deep red. It {{is very similar to}} the Small Red-eyed Damselfly.|$|R
50|$|The {{site has}} fen, {{freshwater}} dykes and grazing marshes. Resident wildfowl include wigeons, gadwalls, teals and shovelers are joined in winter by migrants when the marshes are flooded. Scarce chaser and the nationally rare Norfolk hawker dragonflies breed on the site, {{and there are}} <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselflies.</b>|$|R
50|$|The scarce <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>{{damselfly}}</b> {{or small}} bluetail (Ischnura pumilio) {{is a member}} of the damselfly family Coenagrionidae.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Ischnura elegans) - can {{tolerate}} brackish conditions and breeds on St Agnes, St Mary's and Tresco.|$|E
50|$|Odonata inhabiting {{the reserve}} include the red-eyed damselfly, {{southern}} damselfly, scarce <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly,</b> brown hawker, scarce chaser and keeled skimmer.|$|E
50|$|Female <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>Damselflies</b> come in {{a variety}} of colour forms. Juveniles may be salmon pink, form rufescens; violet, form violacea and a pale green form. The colour darkens as the {{damselfly}} ages. Mature females may be blue like the male, form typica; olive green thorax and brown spot, form infuscans or pale brown thorax and brown spot, form infusca-obseleta.|$|R
50|$|Adult male <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselflies</b> have a {{head and}} thorax {{patterned}} with blue and black. They have a largely black abdomen with very narrow pale markings where each segment joins the next. Segment eight, however, is entirely pale blue. At rest, {{the wings of}} most damselfly species are held back together, unlike dragonflies, which rest with their wings out flat. The thorax of juvenile males has a green tinge. A male can try to interfere with a mating pair, by attaching itself to the mating male.|$|R
50|$|A list of Dragonfly larvae {{produced}} in 2000 included red-eyed, variable, and <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselflies.</b> Sample fishing in 1997 documented a dozen species, most notably roach and zander but also northern pike, perch, eel, trout, - of which {{some have been}} introduced into the lake - and many others. The lake was struck by crayfish plague in 1950 but crayfish was reintroduced around 1970. North-east of the lake smooth newt, common frog, and common toad were documented in 1996. Noctule bats documented in the area, previously assigned the status near-threatened, are now considered least concern. Soprano pipistrelle has also been seen along the northern shore of the lake. Couples of great crested grebes and common terns are breeding by the lake together with colonies of black-headed gulls, mute swans, Canada geese, herring gulls, and lesser black-backed gulls.|$|R
50|$|The site {{contains}} 25 {{species of}} butterfly and 15 dragonfly and damselfly species, {{which include the}} nationally scarce varieties of silver-studded blue (Plebejus argus) and <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Ischnura pumilio).|$|E
50|$|The nationally rare Scarce <b>Blue-tailed</b> <b>Damselfly</b> (Ischnura pumilio) {{is one of}} the 13 {{species of}} {{dragonfly}} and damselfly that the ponds on the moor supports. The site also supports 99 recorded species of Lepidoptera.|$|E
50|$|On {{the site}} {{can be found}} 13 species of {{dragonfly}} and damselfly, which include the scarce <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly,</b> a nationally rare species. Aquatic beetles are also present on the moor, the very scarce Hydrochus nitidicollis being one, as well as 2 uncommon spiders.|$|E
40|$|Species exhibiting colour {{polymorphism}} {{are thought}} to have an ecological advantage at the landscape scale, because spatial segregation of alternatively adapted ecotypes into diverse habitats can increase the species' niche breadth and thus confer greater geographic range size. However, morph frequencies are also influenced by intrapopulational processes such as frequency- or density-dependent social interactions. To identify how social feedback may affect clinal variation in morph frequencies, we investigated reciprocal interactions between morph-specific thermal tolerance, local climatic conditions and social environments, {{in the context of a}} colour-morph frequency cline associated with a recent range expansion in <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselflies</b> (Ischnura elegans) in Sweden. Cold tolerances of gynochromes (female-like female morph) were positively correlated with local gynochrome frequencies, suggesting a positive frequency-dependent fitness benefit. In contrast, androchrome (male-mimic female morph) cold tolerances were improved following recent exposure to cold weather, suggesting a beneficial environmental acclimation effect. Thus, according to an environment-matching hypothesis for clinal variation, androchrome frequencies should therefore increase towards the (cooler) range limit. In contrast to this prediction, gynochrome frequencies increased at the expanding range limit, consistent with a positive frequency-dependent social feedback that is beneficial when invading novel climates. Our results suggest that when phenotypes or fitnesses are affected by interactions with conspecifics, beneficial social effects on environmental tolerances may (i) facilitate range shifts, and (ii) reverse or counteract typical patterns of intraspecific interactions and environment-matching clines observed in stable populations observed over broader geographic scales. 10 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The Llangasty Nature Reserve {{forms an}} {{important}} protected {{area around the}} lake's boundary. The lake is a habitat of the Scarce <b>Blue-tailed</b> <b>Damselfly</b> (Ishnura pumilio). In May 2011 hundreds of water voles were released near Llangorse Lake in an ongoing programme to try to restore their numbers.|$|E
50|$|Newtown Green {{consists}} of open areas of green space for informal recreation and organised sports. Mature trees form {{the perimeter of}} the site and the Aylesford Stream runs along the edge. Ruddy darter, banded demoiselle, <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> and common blue damselfly have been recorded at the site.|$|E
50|$|At first glance, this {{damselfly}} may {{resemble a}} <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> or a red-eyed damselfly {{more than a}} typical Coenagrion species. Both sexes have a distinctive black abdomen with coloured segments at both the base and the tip. Males have very large appendages that distinguish them from similar species.|$|E
5000|$|The Atlas of the Dragonflies of Britain and Ireland {{published}} in 1996 listed just three species; <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly,</b> common darter (both breeding residents) and the migrant hawker. The pools can be slightly brackish {{at times and}} only species that can tolerate these conditions can establish populations on the islands.|$|E
50|$|Twenty-three {{species of}} {{dragonfly}} and damselfly breed within the site. The ponds, streams and shallow pools {{are used for}} breeding whilst valuable feeding habitat is provided in the adjacent woodland. Three nationally scarce species are present; the scarce <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Ischnura pumilio), a species known to prefer shallow, newly created pools; the downy emerald (Cordulia aenea) and the brilliant emerald (Somatochlora metallica).|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly,</b> migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, four-spotted chaser, broad-bodied chaser, black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|D. villosus is {{omnivorous}} and {{feeds on}} a variety of invertebrates, including other members of the Gammaridae family. It has been found to kill <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> nymphs, water hoglice, water boatman, fish leeches as well as small fish and the eggs of other vertebrates. Often it only kills prey but does not eat it. It kills its prey by biting it with its large mandibles and then shreds it before eating it.|$|E
50|$|The Woorgreens {{reserve is}} {{considered}} to be the Forest of Dean's best dragonfly site, and over seventeen species have been recorded. Some of the species are scarce and breeding colonies in this area are important. They are supported by the network of other ponds and ditches in the area, such as Kensley pond. Breeding populations recorded include <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly,</b> large red damselfly, azure damselfly, southern hawker, ruddy sympetrum, broad-bodied chaser and the emperor dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|The fauna {{is unusually}} varied, {{including}} the European hare, the European stonechat, the shrike, the diving bell spider and {{many kinds of}} amphibians and reptiles, such as the natterjack toad, northern crested newt and grass snake. Waders and songbirds use the area as a brooding site, raptors use the arable land {{as a source of}} prey, and the entire area has an extremely varied insect population including the scarce <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> and small emerald damselfly.|$|E
50|$|Pluck Lake is a lake to {{the east}} of Swansea city centre in the Morfa area north of Kilvey Hill. It forms part of Kilvey Community Woodland. Pluck Lake, is a refuge for <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> and the emperor dragonfly. In April 2008 a {{crocodile}} was supposedly sighted in the waters of the lake attracting some attention from the media and members from The Centre for Fortean Zoology and was nicknamed the Morfadile or Pluck Ness Monster.|$|E
50|$|The {{river and}} ponds of the Tuckingmill Valley Park provide {{valuable}} habitat within an urban area, for two nationally scarce insects; scarce <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Ischnura pumilio) and {{small red damselfly}} (Ceriagrion tenellum). The larvae of the golden-ringed dragonfly (Ceriagrion tenellum) have been found and the adults can be seen through the summer and autumn. Other dragonflies include the common darter (Sympetrum striolatum) and the once rare migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta) which usually fly in August and September.|$|E
50|$|The species occurs {{throughout}} Europe {{except in}} the north. To the east it occurs from Asia Minor to SiberiaTo the south the range extends to Morocco, the Azores and Madeira' The typical male has a black abdomen with a bright blue spot on tail (segments 8 and 9). It {{is very similar to}} the <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly,</b> Ischnura elegans but on that species the blue spot is mostly on segment 8. Females undergo a change of colour as they mature. The immature female is bright orange, the aurantiaca phase, but matures to a greenish-brown.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{the animal}} species {{occurring}} in the nature reserve are fish such as the trout, bleak, burbot and stickleback. It {{is also home to}} the <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> and the emerald dragonfly. Native bird species include the kingfisher, grey wagtail and white-throated dipper. The first two breed in the nature reserve, whilst the dipper only rests and overwinters. In the ponds amongst the grasslands there are amphibians like the common toad, smooth newt, water frog, common frog and moor frog as well as grass snakes. The hedgerows are used by many animals including the red-backed shrike, great spotted woodpecker and tawny owl.|$|E
50|$|Samples of {{bottom fauna}} taken in 1998 {{documented}} {{the presence of}} nationally rare species of gastropods such as Hippeutis complanatus and bivalve swan mussel; and during the preceding decades two species of limnetic gastropods were documented. Larvae of white-legged damselfly and <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> were recorded in summer 2000. Signal crayfish and trout have been introduced in the stream, of which the former succeeded in establishing while roach {{is believed to be}} unfavourable to the latter. The white water rapids make a section of the stream ice-free during the winter time which attracts white-throated dippers and common kingfishers. In 1996, traces of beaver were reported.|$|E
50|$|Bowen's Field is an {{informal}} recreation area, {{adjacent to the}} Great Stour. It is thought that this site {{was one of the}} last areas to be farmed in Ashford, it belonged to a local livestock trader called Mr Sidney Herbert Bowen,died 1971 and he is commemorated on a plaque at the entrance to the site from Victoria Park. This area was also adjacent to the town’s lido (outdoor swimming pool) which was built in 1867 and was at the time the largest in Britain. The site is now a flood storage area consisting of damp grassland, with a large pond where banded demoiselle, <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly,</b> azure damselfly, smooth newt, and common frog have been recorded.|$|E
50|$|The {{site has}} good {{views of the}} North Downs in one {{direction}} and the town of Ashford in the other as well as Boys Hall, the house that gives the site its name. The site is characterised by oak and hazel as well as other mature tree species. A variety of dragonflies and damselflies have been seen at the site including emperor dragonfly, ruddy darter and <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly.</b> There is a pedestrian bridge over High Speed 1, linking this site with Boys Hall Moat. Adjacent to the bridge is an area of reedbed. On the Church Road side of Boys Hall, the site is more formal with mature trees such as turkey oak, providing a pleasant buffer zone between housing and the Southern Orbital road.|$|E
50|$|Singleton Lake is a {{man-made}} fishing lake, it has areas of willow and alder around its perimeter {{as well as}} small areas of reedbed. At night Daubenton's bat can be seen flying over the water. There are 2 sculptures by Antony Gormley (creator of the Angel of the North sculpture) and a stretch of boardwalk. Singleton Lake supports a variety of common bird species, as well as birds that {{are unlikely to be}} seen elsewhere in the Green Corridor including great crested grebe and reed warbler. Two damselfly species have been recorded at the site, common blue damselfly and <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly.</b> Singleton Lake has parking, picnic areas and good links {{to the rest of the}} Green Corridor and wider countryside in the Great Chart area.|$|E
50|$|Ischnura genei, {{the island}} bluetail {{damselfly}}, is {{a species of}} damselfly that replaces the <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> on some Mediterranean islands (e.g., Corsica and Sardinia, where the two species are not known to coexist) - it is found on four islands. It is a small and slender damselfly that tends to be smaller and daintier than the common bluetail. Its main distinguishing features include a black abdomen, which in males carries a striking blue tail-light on S8. Some female colour forms, too, have a blue tail-light on S8, but {{it tends to be}} interrupted by a black mark on either end. In some other female colour forms S8 is rusty brown. The male's pterostigma is bi-coloured (as it is in Ischnura elegans). In Malta, this species is still frequent and breeds, but it is endangered by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|Damselflies {{exist in}} a range of {{habitats}} in and around the wetlands needed for their larval development; these include open spaces for finding mates, suitable perches, open aspect, roosting sites, suitable plant species for ovipositing and suitable water quality, and odontates have been used for bio-indication purposes regarding the quality of the ecosystem. Different species have different requirements for their larvae with regard to water depth, water movement and pH.The European common blue damselfly (Enallagma cyathigerum) for example can occur at high densities in acid waters where fish are absent, such as in bog pools.The scarce <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Ischnura pumilio) in contrast requires base-rich habitats and water with a slow flow-rate. It is found in ditches, quarries, seeps, flushes, marshes and pools. It tolerates high levels of zinc and copper in the sediment but requires suitable emergent plants for egg-laying without the water being choked by plants. Damselflies' dependence on freshwater habitats makes them very vulnerable to damage to wetlands through drainage for agriculture or urban growth.|$|E
50|$|Mammals:The {{following}} {{descriptions of}} mammals of the Ammiq wetlands {{have all been}} recorded by A Rocha personnel in the Aammiq region from 1997 onwards. The region covered includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the slopes of Mount Barouk. In addition to these, other mammal species are probably present but {{have not yet been}} positively identified. One mammal of interest is the European otter Lutra lutra which was reported in the Aammiq wetlands prior to 1975; its reappearance was confirmed in June 2003. Water buffalos were introduced to the swamp {{in order to maintain the}} health of the vegetation cover and the swamp itself, since buffalo graze wetlands in a more efficient way than other herbivores. The mammals recorded in the region include: southern white-breasted hedgehog (Erinaceus concolor), Cape hare (Lepus capensis), Caucasian squirrel (Sciurus anomalus), Indian porcupine (Hystrix indica), gray wolf (Canis lupus), red fox (Vulpes vulpes), European otter (Lutra lutra), European badger (Meles meles), striped hyena (Hyaena hyaena), mountain gazelle (Gazella gazella), wild boar (Sus scrofa). The area was probably also the home of some extinct mammals from Lebanon such as the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica), and the Asiatic cheetah (Acinonyx jubatus venaticus).Birds:Nearly 260 bird species have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. The Aammiq region includes not just the valley floor wetlands but also the adjacent farmlands and the sometimes wooded rocky slopes of Mount Barouk.The listing of these birds does not give any idea of their abundance or status. While some of the birds recorded below are residents, others are passage migrants. Some of these, such as the white stork and the lesser spotted eagle, may pass over Aammiq in flocks of hundreds at a time. Other migrants fly over in far smaller numbers. Species include: pygmy cormorant (Phalacrocorax pygmeus), white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), greater flamingo (Phoenicopterus rubber), ferruginous duck (Aythya nyroca), osprey (Pandion haliaetus), Verreaux's eagle (Aquila verreauxii), peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), common crane (Grus grus), rock pigeon (Columba livia).Amphibians and reptiles: The amphibians and reptiles listed below have been recorded in the Aammiq region either by A Rocha personnel or people working with A Rocha from 1996 onwards. As with the other species lists, the Aammiq region is here taken to include not just the valley floor wetlands, which are very rich in reptiles, but also the adjacent farmlands and the rocky slopes of Mount Barouk. Herpetology, the study of reptiles and amphibians, is a specialised field and as yet there has been no systematic A Rocha herpetological survey of this area. Far more species are known to exist in the area than the ones reported. Species include: European green toad (Bufo viridis), Levantine frog (Rana bedriagae), Levant green lizard (Lacerta media), European worm snake (Typhlops vermicularis), Levant viper (Macrovipera lebetina).Moths, butterflies, and dragonflies:As with many other groups, the moths of the Aammiq region are poorly known. The list below represents an incomplete and provisional list of species so far recorded, though the Aammiq region is rich in butterflies. A Rocha personnel recorded several new records of species since 1998 such as: Oriental marbled skipper (Carcharodus boeticus), swallowtail (Papilio machaon), scarce swallowtail (Iphiclides podalirius), false Apollo (Archon apollinus), large white (Pieris brassicae), plain tiger (Danaus chrysippus), long-tailed blue (Lampides boeticus). Also the Aammiq region has a surprising diversity of dragonflies which can be divided into two groups, the Zygoptera (damselflies) and the Anisoptera (the insects commonly referred to as dragonflies), species include: azure damselfly (Coenagrion puella), <b>blue-tailed</b> <b>damselfly</b> (Ischnura elegans), emperor dragonfly (Anax imperator), southern darter (Sympetrum meridionale), scarlet dragonfly (Crocothemis erythraea).|$|E
