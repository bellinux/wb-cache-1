40|$|The {{concentrations}} of organochlorine insecticides DDT and heptachlor were investigated {{to estimate the}} current status of insecticides used in dry fish. The most popular dry fish– ribbon fish (Chhuri), shrimp (Chingri) and <b>bombay</b> <b>duck</b> (Loittya) were selected for this study and these dry fishes were collected from different markets of Dhaka and Chittagong. The range of DDT used in all the samples was 3. 038 ppb to 874. 966 ppb.
