25|$|The {{first step}} is usually a digital rectal examination, to examine {{the tone of the}} {{sphincter}} and to determine if preparation has been adequate. The endoscope is then passed through the anus up the rectum, the colon (sigmoid, descending, transverse and ascending colon, the cecum), and ultimately the terminal ileum. The endoscope has a movable tip and multiple channels for instrumentation, air, suction and light. The bowel is occasionally insufflated with air to maximize visibility (a procedure which gives one the false sensation of needing to take a <b>bowel</b> <b>movement).</b> Biopsies are frequently taken for histology. Additionally in a procedure known as chromoendoscopy, a contrast-dye (such as Indigo carmine) may be sprayed via the endoscope onto the bowel wall to help visualise any abnormalities in the mucosal morphology. A Cochrane review updated in 2016 found strong evidence that chromoscopy enhances the detection of cancerous tumours in the colon and rectum.|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was conducted on 388 students from {{a high school in}} Morioka City during the time span from late April 1999 to early May of 1999. Research was conducted through a questionnaire asking the condition of passed <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> and amount of food intake. The following results were discovered. 1) The percentage of respondents who passed daily <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> was 23. 0 %. Respondents with a tendency for constipation, passing less than three <b>bowel</b> <b>movements,</b> were 23. 4 %. Those who considered themselves irregular were 31. 3 %. No significant difference in the number of <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> was noted according to gender. 2) Looking at the recognition between health and an understanding of <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> by gender, 83. 3 % of women responded that there was a relationship between constipation and overall health. In contrast, only 71. 9 % of men recognized that there was a relationship between the two. Therefore, a gender difference was noted with men having less knowledge as to the relationship of constipation to daily health. 3) In examining the time when <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> were passed by gender, the highest percentage of both men and women responded that the time fluctuated. For respondents who had an irregular number of <b>bowel</b> <b>movements,</b> the times they passed <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> were also irregular. For both genders, a significant difference was noted between this group and men and women who passed daily <b>bowel</b> <b>movements.</b> 4) In examining men with an irregular number of <b>bowel</b> <b>movements,</b> many were not living a healthy lifestyl in comparison to men who reported daily <b>bowel</b> <b>movements.</b> 5) In regards to people who had an abnormal number of <b>bowel</b> <b>movements,</b> there was a tendency not to have a satisfactory intake of vegetables, meat, and seaweed. Furthermore, there was no recognition as to this tendency...|$|R
40|$|Retrospective {{analysis}} of 211 admissions to a palliative care unit was undertaken {{to explore the}} relationship between prescribed laxatives {{and the frequency of}} documentation of <b>bowel</b> <b>movements.</b> Bivariate analysis flailed to identify relationships between laxatives and the frequency of <b>bowel</b> <b>movements.</b> Relationships were identified between less frequent <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> and type and duration of illness phase. Regression analysis identified 2 variables strongly predictive of the frequency with which <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> were documented. People in longer illness phases {{were more likely to have}} regular <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> (Z = 3. 02, P =. 003). The second significant result was that, even accounting for the short duration of the terminal phase, people who were dying were 13 times less likely to have any <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> documented than those in the stable phase (OR = 13. 2, 95 %CI = 2. 0 - 89. 2).

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted on 382 males {{over the age of}} 65 during the time span from late December 1998 to late January of 1999. The {{research was}} conducted through a questionnaire asking the number of times participants passed <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> and asking about their daily diet and amount of food intake. The following results were discovered. 1) The percentage of men who passed daily <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> was 64. 9 %. Those with a tendency for constipation, passing less than three <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> a week, were 19. 4 %. Men who considered themselves irregular were only 3. 8 %. 2) 87. 8 % responded that they took in an appropriate daily intake of food or almost did, in order to maintain a healthy lifestyle. 81. 8 % responded that they knew or almost knew the suitable amount of daily food intake. 3) 97. 9 % answered that they thought there was a correlation between constipation and general health; 82. 6 % felt that it was appropriate to pass <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> daily. Looking at this response by age categories the following results were seen; 75 years of age or older, 75. 3 %; 65 to 69 years of age 88. 9 %, it was notable that the percentage was lower in men age 75 and older. 4) In examining the time when <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> were passed in men who reported daily <b>bowel</b> <b>movements,</b> 50. 5 % occurred between the time they awoke in the morning and right after finishing breakfast.

Beavis has a penchant for making off-beat sound effects to suit the occasion. Whenever he sees something that is sexually arousing, he imitates a spring (onomatopoetically saying [...] "Boi-oi-oi-oi-oiiing!!!") indicating a quick erection. He sometimes makes a Bronx cheer by puckering his lips. He occasionally does impersonations, such as of Principal McVicker ("Speech Therapy"), motivational speaker Mr. Manners/Mr. Candy ("Manners Suck/Candy Sale"), and Woody Woodpecker ("Top O' the Mountain"). During one episode, Beavis conspicuously reveals that he is sometimes prone to getting erections in the company of other men. A special ability of his is speaking backwards, as seen in [...] "Vidiots", while the duo review a music video; however, he forgets how to do so {{by the end of the}} video. Beavis also displays a predilection for defecating and things that are related to it, and in a high-pitched tone will often enthusiastically utter the word [...] "poop", or will say the word [...] "plop" [...] to indicate a <b>bowel</b> <b>movement.</b> He frequently pulls down his pants during music video reviews. He also took Kaopectate once after hearing it is for diarrhea under the misconception he would get diarrhea; he was only soothed by an enormous <b>bowel</b> <b>movement</b> which he saved in his dresser drawer, much to Butt-Head's disgust. Beavis sometimes displays examples of the idiot savant when slapped hard by Butt-Head or when attempting to pass out by holding his breath and blowing into his thumb, in which cases Beavis starts to make intellectual statements usually regarding the music videos he is viewing.|$|E

2500|$|This test may {{be done in}} a {{hospital}} or clinic. The patient lies on the X-ray table and a preliminary X-ray is taken. The patient is then asked to lie on the side while a well lubricated enema tube is inserted into the rectum. As the enema enters the body, the patient might have the sensation that they have to have a <b>bowel</b> <b>movement.</b> The barium sulfate, a radiodense (shows as white on X-ray) contrast medium, is then allowed to flow into the colon. A large balloon {{at the tip of the}} enema tube may be inflated to help keep the barium sulfate inside. The flow of the barium sulfate is monitored by the health care provider on an X-ray fluoroscope screen (like a TV monitor). Air may be puffed into the colon to distend it and provide better images (often called a [...] "double-contrast" [...] exam). If air is used, the enema tube will be reinserted if it had been removed and a small amount of air will be introduced into the colon, and more X-ray pictures are taken.|$|E

Fifty infants were {{evaluated}} at 1, 2, 4, 6, 9 and 12 months of age. Data regarding bowel habits was recorded by parents daily for 2 days before coming to the hospital at each visit. The mean frequency of <b>bowel</b> <b>movements</b> per day was maximal (3. 16 stools) during the newborn period and declined (1. 59 stools) by the age of 12 months. At birth stool consistency was mostly runny, and became consistently more solid by 4 months of age.
