40|$|BACKGROUND: Diabetes {{mellitus}} (DM) is a {{metabolic disorder}} that {{is associated with}} an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Vaccinium myrtillus (<b>bilberry)</b> is a useful plant with antidiabetic properties in traditional medicine. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effects of <b>bilberry</b> against DM. Diabetes was induced using intraperitoneal injection of alloxan (120 mg kg- 1 body weight (BW)). <b>Bilberry</b> powder (2 g d- 1) and glibenclamide (positive control; 0. 6 mg kg- 1 BW) were administered for 4 weeks following alloxan injection. Serum glucose, insulin, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), very-low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL-C), triglycerides (TG) and C-reactive protein (CRP) were determined at baseline and at 2 nd and 4 th week of the study. RESULTS: <b>Bilberry</b> supplementation resulted in a significant reduction of glucose compared with the diabetic control as well as glibenclamide treatment. <b>Bilberry</b> elevated insulin, reduced TC, LDL-C, VLDL-C and TG levels, and prevented HDL-C decline. Serum insulin, TC and LDL-C levels were not affected by glibenclamide, and CRP did not significantly change with either <b>bilberry</b> or glibenclamide. Histological examinations revealed a significant elevation of islet size in the <b>bilberry</b> and glibenclamide-treated groups.

40|$|Abstract Background Obesity and {{metabolic}} syndrome are important public concerns, {{and there is}} increasing demand for effective therapeutic strategies. Flavonoids are expected to improve the risk factors associated with {{metabolic syndrome}}. Anthocyanidins {{are a kind of}} flavonoids; well known for their anti-oxidative, anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor properties. However, their effects on adipocytes and molecular systems are not well defined. In this study, we examined the effects of anthocyanidins-enriched <b>bilberry</b> extracts on adipocyte differentiation. Methods Utilizing 3 T 3 -L 1 cell line, we investigated that <b>bilberry</b> extracts and anthocyanidins induced inhibition of lipid accumulation during adipogenesis. To identify what is the most important <b>bilberry</b> mediated-effect, we analyzed the expressions of key transcriptional factors associated with adipocyte differentiation by Real Time (RT) -PCR. From the results of RT-PCR, we hypothesized that <b>bilberry</b> extracts and anthocyanidins blocks insulin signal, we determined the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS 1) protein by western blotting analysis. In addition, we compared the whole-genome expression profiles of early stage of adipocyte differentiation under four different growth conditions (DMSO, <b>bilberry,</b> two anthocyanidins) by microarray analyses and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA). Results Exposure to <b>bilberry</b> extracts and anthocyanidins during adipocyte differentiation inhibited 3 T 3 -L 1 differentiation. During this period, <b>bilberry</b> extracts and anthocyanidin significantly decreased a key adipocyte differentiation-associated marker, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor- γ (Ppar γ) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 c (Srebp 1 c). Western blotting analysis showed that <b>bilberry</b> extracts and anthocyanidin decreased the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues of IRS 1. In addition, microarray experiments and GSEA data revealed significantly altered expression of the known genes of the insulin pathway in cells treated with <b>bilberry</b> extracts or anthocyanidins in the early differentiation stages. Conclusions Our data demonstrate that anthocyanidin enriched <b>bilberry</b> extracts strongly inhibit the adipocyte differentiation via the insulin pathway. Furthermore, <b>bilberry</b> extracts might be used as a potential complementary treatment for the obese patients with metabolic syndrome. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Flavonoids are a {{class of}} {{secondary}} metabolites in plants {{that are involved in}} many important functions. Various flavonoid compounds have also been reported to be beneficial for human health. <b>Bilberry</b> (Vaccinium myrtillus L.) is the characteristic field layer species in boreal forests and the fruits of <b>bilberry</b> are rich in anthocyanin pigments, a subclass of flavonoids. In the present work, flavonoid biosynthesis was examined in different tissues of <b>bilberry.</b> The focus was on the developing fruits of wild type and natural color mutants of <b>bilberry,</b> and on effect of solar radiation on flavonoid biosynthesis in <b>bilberry</b> leaves. For the isolation of RNA for gene expression analysis, a method was optimized for different tissues of <b>bilberry.</b> The cDNA fragments of five genes from the flavonoid pathway, coding phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, chalcone synthase, flavanone 3 -hydroxylase, dihydroflavanol 4 -reductase and anthocyanidin synthase, were isolated from <b>bilberry</b> using polymerase chain reaction technique, sequenced, and labelled with dioxigenin-dUTP label. These homologous, bilberry-specific probes were used for determining the expression of the flavonoid pathway genes in <b>bilberry</b> fruits, flowers and leaves with a modified non-radioactive method developed {{in the course of the}} study. The anthocyanins, catechins, proanthocyanidins, flavonols and hydroxycinnamic acids in fruits, leaves and different fractions of <b>bilberry</b> were identified and quantified with high-performance liquid chromatography combined with a diode array detector and mass spectrometer. The results demonstrate a correlation between anthocyanin accumulation and expression of the flavonoid pathway genes during the ripening of berries. A correlation between flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthesis was detected in <b>bilberry</b> and also in previous literature collected from flavonol and anthocyanin analyses from other fruits. Accordingly, models for the connection between flavonol and anthocyanin synthesis in fruit species were suggested. Activation of the expression of flavonoid pathway genes and accumulation of flavonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids was detected in leaves growing under direct solar radiation, compared to the shadow leaves of the same plants. Based on the results, it is suggested that cyanidin of anthocyanins and flavonol quercetin play a predominant role in the defence against high solar radiation in Vaccinium leaves. The results give new information about the biosynthesis of flavonoids in <b>bilberry</b> at the gene level, in addition to the information of the composition and content of flavonoids during fruit development and in different parts of the <b>bilberry</b> plant. Also, new information was obtained of the roles of flavonoids in protecting plants from excess solar radiation...|$|R

Additionally, to determine details of the mechanism of the neuroprotective effect of <b>bilberry</b> extract anthocyanins and the involvement of endoplasmic reticulum stress suppression in the mouse retina. Materials and methods: Anthocyanins in <b>bilberry</b> extract (100 mg/kg/day or 500 mg/kg/day) were administrated orally to C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. The expression levels of various molecular chaperones were assessed with quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction, Western blotting, and immunohistochemistry. RGC survival was evaluated by measuring the gene expression of RGC markers and counting retrogradely labeled RGCs after optic nerve crush. Results: The protein levels of Grp 78 and Grp 94 increased significantly in mice after <b>bilberry</b> extract administration. Increased Grp 78 and Grp 94 levels were detected in the inner nuclear layer and ganglion cell layer of the retina, surrounding the RGCs. Gene expression of Chop, Bax, and Atf 4 increased in mice after optic nerve crush and decreased significantly after oral <b>bilberry</b> extract administration. RGC survival after nerve crush also increased with <b>bilberry</b> extract administration. Conclusion: These results indicate that oral <b>bilberry</b> extract administration suppresses RGC death. <b>Bilberry</b> extract administration increased Grp 78 and Grp 94 protein levels, an effect which may underlie the neuroprotective effect of <b>bilberry</b> extract after optic nerve crush.
