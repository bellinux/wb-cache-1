25|$|The first Finnish {{statutory}} regulation for ships navigating in ice was given on 27 March 1890. It was primarily intended {{to increase the}} safety and set a number of requirements for passenger ships operating regularly in winter conditions. These included double bottom in way of the engines and boilers, construction {{according to the rules}} of Lloyd's Register or <b>Bureau</b> <b>Veritas,</b> at least five transverse watertight bulkheads, and sufficient damage stability to survive the flooding of two compartments without sinking. The last requirement is interesting because it {{was not included in the}} latter ice class rules and did not become mandatory again for ships partaking in international traffic until 1960.|$|E
25|$|In May 2011, {{the debate}} over Nestlé's {{unethical}} marketing of infant formula was relaunched in the Asia-Pacific region. Nineteen leading Laos-based international NGOs, including Save the Children, Oxfam, CARE International, Plan International, and World Vision have launched a boycott of Nestlé and written {{an open letter to}} the company. Among other unethical practices, the NGOs criticised the lack of labelling in Laos and the provision of incentives to doctors and nurses to promote the use of infant formula. In November 2011, <b>Bureau</b> <b>Veritas</b> was commissioned by Nestlé S.A. to provide independent assurance of Nestlé Indochina’s compliance with the Nestlé policy for the implementation of the World Health Organisation (WHO) International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes (1981). There was no significant evidence that indicated Nestlé Indochina was systematically operating in violation of the WHO Code and Lao PDR Decree in Lao PDR. The presence of promotional materials in retail units constituted a non-conformance, and <b>Bureau</b> <b>Veritas</b> recommended that the Nestlé’s Policy and Procedures Manual on the Marketing of breastmilk substitutes be reviewed and updated to ensure consistency against the more stringent requirements of the Lao PDR Decree. Ernest W. Lefever and the Ethics and Public Policy Center were criticized for accepting a $25,000 contribution from Nestlé while the organization {{was in the process of}} developing a report investigating medical care in developing nations which was never published. It was alleged that this contribution affected the release of the report and led to the author of the report submitting an article to Fortune Magazine praising the company's position.|$|E
25|$|An inquest {{into the}} deaths of the {{passengers}} was held at College Farm on 19 August. Evidence was given that the aircraft had been inspected before the flight, and a certificate that it was fit to fly had been issued by <b>Bureau</b> <b>Veritas.</b> The aircraft was capable of flying on three engines. The cause of death of both passengers was ruptures to their lungs. A verdict of Accidental death was given in both cases. The inquest into the death of the pilot was held on 26 August in Folkestone. Evidence given at the inquest into {{the deaths of}} the passengers showed that the pilot was experienced, having started his flying career with the French Army during the First World War. He had been employed by Air Union for three years. A verdict of accidental death was returned.|$|E
25|$|Arcticaborg and Antarcticaborg {{were ordered}} from Kværner Masa-Yards Helsinki New Shipyard in December 1997 {{following}} extensive research and model testing at the company's Arctic Technology Centre, nowadays known as Aker Arctic. Constructed in the covered dry dock {{at the same}} time, both ships were delivered to Wagenborg Kazakhstan BV, {{a subsidiary of the}} Dutch shipping company Wagenborg, within a week in October 1998 and sailed from Finland through the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and finally to the Caspian Sea through rivers Don and Volga. The final ice trials were conducted in the following spring. The ships were placed under long-term charter by Offshore Kazakhstan International Operating Company (OKIOC), a consortium which includes Royal Dutch Shell. Although initially classified by <b>Bureau</b> <b>Veritas</b> and flying the Dutch flag, the ships were reclassified by the Russian Maritime Register of Shipping and their port of registry was changed to Aktau, Kazakhstan, shortly after delivery.|$|E

2500|$|The inquest {{was held}} on 5 October at The Priory, Hildenborough. Representatives from British {{national}} newspapers attended, {{as well as those}} from elsewhere. Evidence heard covered two areas; the identity of the victims and the cause of the crash. The jury were informed that they might make any recommendations that they saw fit. A doctor gave evidence that all the victims had suffered multiple fractures, and that death would have occurred within a short time of the accident. The aircraft had been inspected before the flight, and a certificate issued by <b>Bureau</b> <b>Veritas</b> showing that it was fit for flight. The pilot was experienced, with over 2,000 hours flying time, and had been in the employ of Air Union since 1920. He had made 61 return flights between Paris and London. On being questioned, Major Cooper of the Air Ministry stated that there had never been a previous case of an airliner catching fire in the air. The jury returned a verdict of [...] "Accidental death" [...] against all seven victims. The behaviour of the spectators was deplored by both jury and coroner.|$|E
