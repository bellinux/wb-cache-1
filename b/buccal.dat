5|$|Digestion {{starts in}} <b>buccal</b> cavity (mouth) as {{partially}} chewed food is {{broken down by}} saliva from the salivary glands. As the salivary glands produce fluid and carbohydrate-digesting enzymes (mostly amylases), strong muscles in the pharynx pump fluid into the <b>buccal</b> cavity, lubricating the food like the salivarium does, and helping blood feeders, and xylem and phloem feeders.|$|E
5|$|The lungs of most {{frogs and}} other {{amphibians}} are simple and balloon-like, with gas exchange {{limited to the}} outer surface of the lung. This is not very efficient, but amphibians have low metabolic demands and can also quickly dispose of carbon dioxide by diffusion across their skin in water, and supplement their oxygen supply by the same method. Amphibians employ a positive pressure system to get air to their lungs, forcing air down into the lungs by <b>buccal</b> pumping. This is distinct from most higher vertebrates, who use a breathing system driven by negative pressure where the lungs are inflated by expanding the rib cage. In <b>buccal</b> pumping, {{the floor of the}} mouth is lowered, filling the mouth cavity with air. The throat muscles then presses the throat against the underside of the skull, forcing the air into the lungs.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indication}} that feet and other tetrapod traits evolved while {{the animals were}} still aquatic is how they were feeding. They {{did not have the}} modifications of the skull and jaw that allowed them to swallow prey on land. Prey could be caught in the shallows, at the water's edge or on land, but had to be eaten in water where hydrodynamic forces from the expansion of their <b>buccal</b> cavity would force the food into their esophagus.|$|E
5|$|Frogs in the genera Heleioporus and Neobatrachus lack vocal sacs but {{can still}} produce a loud call. Their <b>buccal</b> cavity is {{enlarged}} and dome-shaped, {{acting as a}} resonance chamber that amplifies the sound. Species of frog that lack vocal sacs and {{that do not have}} a loud call tend to inhabit areas close to constantly noisy, flowing water. They need to use an alternative means to communicate. The coastal tailed frog (Ascaphus truei) lives in mountain streams in North America and does not vocalize.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, the European Medicines Agency {{granted a}} {{marketing}} authorisation for a <b>buccal</b> application form of midazolam, sold under the trade name Buccolam. Buccolam was approved {{for the treatment}} of prolonged, acute, convulsive seizures in people from three months to less than 18 years of age. This was the first application of a paediatric-use marketing authorisation.|$|E
5|$|Lentigines — Reddish-brown to {{dark brown}} macules (surface skin lesion) {{generally}} occurring {{in a high}} number (10,000+) over {{a large portion of}} the skin, at times higher than 80% coverage. These can even appear inside the mouth (<b>buccal),</b> or on the surface of the eye (scleral). These have irregular borders and range in size from 1mm in diameter to café-au-lait spots, several centimeters in diameter. Also, some areas of vitiligo-like hypopigmentation may be observed.|$|E
5|$|The {{first section}} of the {{alimentary}} canal is the foregut (element 27 in numbered diagram), or stomodaeum. The foregut is lined with a cuticular lining made of chitin and proteins as protection from tough food. The foregut includes the <b>buccal</b> cavity (mouth), pharynx, esophagus and crop and proventriculus (any part may be highly modified), which both store food and signify when to continue passing onward to the midgut.|$|E
5|$|The upper molars of Dermotherium {{chimaera}} are triangular {{in overall}} shape and much broader than long, with the narrow {{end of the}} triangle pointing lingually. The M2 from Pakistan that was tentatively placed in D.chimaera is slightly smaller than Thai fossils of the species, but otherwise very similar. The crest in front of and behind the major cusps on the <b>buccal</b> side of the tooth, the paracone and metacone, are well-developed, together forming a long W-shaped ridge. D.chimaera resembles the Philippine colugo in that the crests behind the paracone {{and in front of}} the metacone form an acute angle with each other, so that together they form a V; their shape rather resembles an U in the Sunda colugo. A cingulum (shelf) is present on the <b>buccal</b> margin of the tooth, but this cingulum is rather weak in the Pakistani fossil. On the M2, smaller cusps, the paraconule and metaconule, are present on the lingual sides of the paracone and metacone, but on the M1 the paraconule is missing and the metaconule is small and ridgelike. The small cusps are better developed in the Pakistani M2. A third major cusp, the protocone, is present on the lingual side of both upper molars. This crest is displaced towards the front in the living colugos, but less so in D.chimaera. Two strong crests descend from the front and back faces of the protocone in a <b>buccal</b> direction. These crests end in small cusps (protoconules) that are directly lingual to the paracone and metacone. The living colugos lack these protoconules. The enamel is wrinkled on the flanks of the paracone and metacone and, in the Thai but not the Pakistani specimens, on the lingual side of the protocone. Enamel wrinkling is also seen in some Philippine colugos.|$|E
5|$|There {{have also}} been {{experiments}} to test pitohui batrachotoxins on potential predators. They {{have been shown to}} irritate the <b>buccal</b> membranes of brown tree snakes and green tree pythons, both of which are avian predators in New Guinea. The unpalatability of the species is also known to local hunters, which otherwise hunt songbirds of the same size.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{have two}} pairs of mammae, one on the chest (pectoral) {{and one on the}} abdomen (abdominal). Their fur is {{typically}} grayish-brown on the dorsal (back) side and more gray in color on the ventral (front) side. The tail is typically black-tipped. The new population found by WWF in 2010 has an overall lighter color, along with reddish or rusty patches near the hands and feet on the dorsal side of the arms and legs. This population also has a red tail, which darkens at the end. Vibrissae are found above the eyes (superciliary), above the mouth (<b>buccal),</b> under the lower jaw (genal), {{near the top of the}} jaw (interramal), and on the wrist (carpal). Like mouse lemurs, the ears are large and membranous.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged convulsive epileptic {{seizures}} are {{a medical}} emergency that {{can usually be}} dealt with effectively by administering fast-acting benzodiazepines, which are potent anticonvulsants. In a hospital environment, intravenous clonazepam, lorazepam, and diazepam are first-line choices, clonazepam due to its stronger and more potent anticonvulsant action, diazepam due to its faster onset and lorazepam for its longer duration of action. In the community, intravenous administration is not practical and so rectal diazepam or (more recently) <b>buccal</b> midazolam are used, with a preference for midazolam as its administration is easier and more socially acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Reptilian lungs {{typically}} receive air via {{expansion and}} contraction of the ribs driven by axial muscles and <b>buccal</b> pumping. Crocodilians also {{rely on the}} hepatic piston method, in which the liver is pulled back by a muscle anchored to the pubic bone (part of the pelvis) called the diaphragmaticus, which in turn creates negative pressure in the crocodile's thoracic cavity, allowing air to be moved into the lungs by Boyle's law. Turtles, which are unable to move their ribs, instead use their forelimbs and pectoral girdle to force air {{in and out of}} the lungs.|$|E
5|$|The {{zebra shark}} feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled <b>buccal</b> cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. Known parasites of the zebra shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.|$|E
5|$|Their {{eyes are}} large and covered entirely by a {{transparent}} secondary cornea. They are greenish at the base. A pair of prominent ridges (olfactory crests) are present on the ventral surface of the head at the rear edge of the eyes. The mouth area is supported by seven triangular flaps (<b>buccal</b> lappets), each with 0 to 7 suckers of less than 0.2mm in diameter and 18 to 25 teeth. The strong, curved, and short beaks (rostra) are mostly black to dark brown. The radula has seven rows of teeth.|$|E
5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of aphthous stomatitis, {{accounting}} for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration (MiAU), or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10mm in diameter (usually about 2–3mm), and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and <b>buccal</b> mucosa, lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of ulceration, there is usually an ulcer-free period of variable length.|$|E
5|$|When an {{adequate}} band of attached tissue is absent, {{it can be}} recreated with a soft tissue graft. There are four methods {{that can be used}} to transplant soft tissue. A roll of tissue adjacent to an implant (referred to as a palatal roll) can be moved towards the lip (<b>buccal),</b> gingiva from the palate can be transplanted, deeper connective tissue from the palate can be transplanted or, when a larger piece of tissue is needed, a finger of tissue based on a blood vessel in the palate (called a vascularized interpositional periosteal-connective tissue (VIP-CT) flap) can be repositioned to the area.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians are a {{class of}} animals {{comprising}} frogs, salamanders and caecilians. They are tetrapods, but the caecilians and a few species of salamander have either no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their main bones are hollow and lightweight and are fully ossified and the vertebrae interlock {{with each other and}} have articular processes. Their ribs are usually short and may be fused to the vertebrae. Their skulls are mostly broad and short, and are often incompletely ossified. Their skin contains little keratin and lacks scales, but contains many mucous glands and in some species, poison glands. The hearts of amphibians have three chambers, two atria and one ventricle. They have a urinary bladder and nitrogenous waste products are excreted primarily as urea. Amphibians breathe by means of <b>buccal</b> pumping, a pump action in which air is first drawn into the buccopharyngeal region through the nostrils. These are then closed and the air is forced into the lungs by contraction of the throat. They supplement this with gas exchange through the skin which needs to be kept moist.|$|E
5|$|Other {{distinguishing}} {{features of the}} false potto are in the dentition. Sarmiento notes, however, that captive specimens may develop abnormalities in the teeth and that some dental characters Schwartz uses are quite variable, sometimes even {{from one side of}} the same individual to another. The third upper molar (M3) is more reduced in the false potto than in any other prosimian, according to Schwartz, but Leon notes that western pottos also have a relatively small M3. The third upper premolar (P3) is also reduced, resembling the condition in the fork-marked lemurs (Phaner). Stump writes that small P3s are also common in western pottos, although the false potto's P3 is shaped differently. Groves notes that P1 is quite long, another point of similarity with the fork-marked lemurs. The lower premolars are compressed laterally in Pseudopotto, the cusps on the cheekteeth are higher, and the cristid obliqua (a crest connected to the protoconid cusp) is at a relatively <b>buccal</b> position (in the direction of the cheeks).|$|E
5|$|Other tumors {{can include}} trichodiscomas (tumors {{of the hair}} disc, which may be {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (<b>buccal</b> mucosa), tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{formula is}} , {{as in all}} lemurids. The toothcomb—a comblike {{structure}} formed by the lower front teeth, characteristic of lemurs and lorisoids—is {{similar to that of}} other lemurids. The two halves of the mandible (lower jaw) do not fuse at the mandibular symphysis. However, there are some differences in tooth morphology from the living brown and ring-tailed lemurs, similar to those between the ruffed lemurs and the other genera. In Pachylemur, the talonid basin (a basin at the back end of the lower molars) is more elongate, and it is not lined by an entoconid cusp. In the first two upper molars, the lingual cingulum (a shelf on the inner, or lingual, side of the tooth) is expanded towards the front. The two species differ in details of tooth morphology. P.insignis had narrower lower premolars and molars, and the <b>buccal</b> (outer) cusps on these teeth are located to the front of their lingual counterparts. Relative to the ruffed lemurs, Pachylemur has more massive jaws and larger molars.|$|E
5|$|The {{epaulette}} shark is an opportunistic predator of benthic crustaceans, worms, and small bony fish. Off Heron Island, over 90% of the {{epaulette shark}}'s diet consists of polychaete worms and crabs, with juveniles taking mostly {{the former and}} adults mostly the latter. It hunts most actively at dawn and dusk, though feeding can occur {{at any time during}} the day. This shark relies mainly on its olfactory and electroreceptive senses to locate hidden prey. It is capable of sucking prey into its mouth by expanding its muscular <b>buccal</b> cavity. While searching for food, the epaulette shark sometimes turns over debris with its snout or thrusts its head into the sand, swallowing food items while expelling the sand grains through its gill slits. Unlike most sharks, the epaulette shark may chew its food for up to 510 minutes. Its teeth can be depressed to form a flat surface for crushing hard-shelled prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{leopard shark}} captures prey by {{expanding}} its <b>buccal</b> cavity {{to create a}} suction force, which is facilitated by its labial cartilages swinging forward to form the mouth into a tube. Simultaneously, the shark protrudes its jaws forward to grip the prey between its teeth. As with other sharks, {{the teeth of the}} leopard shark are periodically shed and replaced; it takes 9ndash&12 days for a replacement tooth to move into position. Leopard sharks have been caught with stomachs filled with clam siphons, which the sharks seize before the clams can retract and break off with a levering motion of their bodies. On occasion, the shark tears the entire clam body out of its shell this way. Other sharks examined have had stomachs containing whole innkeeper worms with no bite marks, suggesting that the sharks sucked them out of their burrows. Under a hollow bridge support in San Francisco Bay, a group of leopard sharks and spiny dogfish have been observed feeding on a dense school of anchovies by slowly swimming counterclockwise through the clockwise-swimming school, and swallowing any anchovies that accidentally entered their open mouths.|$|E
5|$|The lungs are {{the primary}} organs of the {{respiratory}} system in humans and many other animals including a few fish and some snails. In mammals and most other vertebrates, two lungs are located near the backbone {{on either side of}} the heart. Their function in the respiratory system is to extract oxygen from the atmosphere and transfer it into the bloodstream, and to release carbon dioxide from the bloodstream into the atmosphere, in a process of gas exchange. Respiration is driven by different muscular systems in different species. Mammals, reptiles and birds use their different muscles to support and foster breathing. In early tetrapods, air was driven into the lungs by the pharyngeal muscles via <b>buccal</b> pumping, a mechanism still seen in amphibians. In humans, the main muscle of respiration that drives breathing is the diaphragm. The lungs also provide airflow that makes vocal sounds including human speech possible.|$|E
5|$|The lungs in {{amphibians}} are primitive {{compared to}} those of amniotes, possessing few internal septa and large alveoli, and consequently having a comparatively slow diffusion rate for oxygen entering the blood. Ventilation is accomplished by <b>buccal</b> pumping. Most amphibians, however, are able to exchange gases with the water or air via their skin. To enable sufficient cutaneous respiration, the surface of their highly vascularised skin must remain moist to allow the oxygen to diffuse at a sufficiently high rate. Because oxygen concentration in the water increases at both low temperatures and high flow rates, aquatic amphibians in these situations can rely primarily on cutaneous respiration, as in the Titicaca water frog and the hellbender salamander. In air, where oxygen is more concentrated, some small species can rely solely on cutaneous gas exchange, most famously the plethodontid salamanders, which have neither lungs nor gills. Many aquatic salamanders and all tadpoles have gills in their larval stage, with some (such as the axolotl) retaining gills as aquatic adults.|$|E
5|$|The maxilla of Paranthodon {{preserves}} the tooth row, and {{shows that there}} is little to no overhang. This differs from ankylosaurians, where there is a large amount of overhang of the maxilla. The teeth also have a middle ridge, with five fewer prominent ridges on either side. This is similar to the size ridges seen on Kentrosaurus. Like all stegosaurians, the denticles on the teeth are rounded at the tips, in contrast to ankylosaurians. Also, like Huayangosaurus, but unlike Kentrosaurus and Stegosaurus, Paranthodon possesses a prominent <b>buccal</b> margination (a ridge beside the tooth row). Paranthodon teeth preserve wear, but wear is absent on most teeth, similar to Huayangosaurus, meaning it is likely that Paranthodon lacked occlusion between teeth. Paranthodon is distinguished from other stegosaurs by a long, wide, posterior process of the premaxilla, teeth in the maxilla with a very large cingulum, and large ridges on the tooth crowns. Not all of these features were considered valid in a 2008 review of Stegosauria, with the only autapomorphy found being the possession of a partial second bony palate on the maxilla.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} frog is {{permeable}} to {{oxygen and}} carbon dioxide, {{as well as to}} water. There are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when a frog is underwater, oxygen diffuses directly into the blood. When not submerged, a frog breathes by a process known as <b>buccal</b> pumping. Its lungs {{are similar to those of}} humans, but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and no ribs or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out. Instead, it puffs out its throat and draws air in through the nostrils, which in many species can then be closed by valves. When the floor of the mouth is compressed, air is forced into the lungs. The fully aquatic Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can breathe air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The <b>buccal</b> cavity of the electric eel may breathe air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish breathe by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers breathe by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E
5|$|Methamphetamine (meth), {{a highly}} {{addictive}} drug {{that produces a}} dramatic increase in energy and euphoria, can have negative health effects that include serious dental problems. , it is the most discussed illegal drug in dental literature. The most notable effect of long-term use of methamphetamine on dental health is the development of caries (tooth decay); the teeth of some drug users appear to be dark and in the process of disintegrating. Caries often occur in the cervical regions of teeth, where the tooth surface narrows at the junction of the crown and the root. It is usually found on the <b>buccal</b> (cheek) side of the teeth and on tooth surfaces that are adjacent to incisors and canines; eventually, the coronal tooth area, near the crown, can be affected by the decay and erosion. The dental caries of meth mouth often progress slowly, perhaps because their advancement is hindered by intermittent hygienic practices. The decay can lead to tooth fractures and severe pain. In some cases, teeth are permanently damaged and must be removed. Along with malnutrition and weight loss, the dental effects of methamphetamine use contribute to the appearance of premature aging seen in some users. The effects of meth mouth {{are similar to those of}} Sjögren's syndrome, an autoimmune disease that causes a lack of saliva, which results in tooth decay.|$|E
5|$|Midazolam is {{sometimes}} {{used for the}} acute management of seizures. Long-term use {{for the management of}} epilepsy is not recommended due to the significant risk of tolerance (which renders midazolam and other benzodiazepines ineffective) and the significant side effect of sedation. A benefit of midazolam is that in children it can be administered buccally or intranasally at home or at school for emergency control of acute seizures, including status epilepticus. Midazolam is effective for status epilepticus that has not improved following other treatments or when intravenous access cannot be obtained, and has advantages of being water-soluble, having a rapid onset of action and not causing metabolic acidosis from the propylene glycol vehicle, which occurs with other benzodiazepines. Drawbacks include a high degree of breakthrough seizures—due to the short half-life of midazolam—in over 50% of people treated, as well as treatment failure in 14–18% of people with refractory status epilepticus. Tolerance develops rapidly to the anticonvulsant effect, and the dose may need to be increased by several times to maintain anticonvulsant therapeutic effects. With prolonged use, tolerance and tachyphylaxis can occur and the elimination half-life may increase, up to days. There is evidence <b>buccal</b> and intranasal midazolam is easier to administer and more effective than rectally administered diazepam in the emergency control of seizures.|$|E
25|$|The {{digestive}} system contains enormous <b>buccal</b> mass {{in size and}} muscular development. The pharynx (the largest part of <b>buccal</b> mass) is so large, occupying almost the whole length of the visceral cavity. The esophagus enters to the <b>buccal</b> cavity dorsally in the anterior fourth. The stomach forms a simple elongated sac.|$|E
25|$|Adult M. laryngeus worms are red to reddish-brown {{in color}} {{due to their}} hemophagous nature. They possess spicules ranging from 23-30 μm in length and {{cup-shaped}} <b>buccal</b> capsules (mouths) that open at the anterior end. Located deep in the <b>buccal</b> cavity are eight to 10 teeth that are not thought {{to be used for}} attachment.|$|E

25|$|Following the patch, a {{flavoured}} lollipop of fentanyl citrate {{mixed with}} inert fillers was introduced under {{the brand name}} of Actiq, becoming the first quick-acting formation of fentanyl for use with chronic breakthrough pain. Fentanyl has been developed into an effervescent tab for <b>buccal</b> absorption much like the Actiq lollipop, followed by a <b>buccal</b> spray device for fast-acting relief and other delivery methods currently in development.|$|E
25|$|Buccal: Oxytocin {{used to be}} {{delivered}} in <b>buccal</b> tablets {{but it is not}} common practice any more.|$|E
25|$|One way of {{administering}} resveratrol {{in humans}} may be <b>buccal</b> delivery, that is without swallowing, by direct absorption through tissues {{on the inside}} of the mouth. When one milligram of resveratrol in 50 ml 50% alcohol/ water solution was retained in the mouth for one minute before swallowing, 37nbsp&ng/ml of free resveratrol was measured in plasma two minutes later. This level of unchanged resveratrol in blood can only be achieved with 250nbsp&mg of resveratrol taken in a pill form. However, the viability of a <b>buccal</b> delivery method is called into question due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. For a drug to be absorbed transmucosally it must be in free-form or dissolved. Resveratrol fits the criteria for oral transmucosal dosing, except for this caveat. The low aqueous solubility greatly limits the amount that can be absorbed through the <b>buccal</b> mucosa. Resveratrol that is attempted to be taken buccally was expected to pass through the mucous membrane of the mouth and be absorbed as an oral dose, however, the need to explore <b>buccal</b> delivery in future pharmaceutical formulations was expressed.|$|E
