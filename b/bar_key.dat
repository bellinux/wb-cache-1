50|$|These two preludes each {{progressively}} {{traverse the}} 12 major keys.

50|$|A thumb-shift {{keyboard}} is {{an alternative}} design, popular among professional Japanese typists. Like a standard Japanese keyboard, it has hiragana characters marked in addition to Latin letters, but the layout is completely different. Most letter keys have two kana characters associated with them, which allows all the characters to fit in three rows, like in Western layouts. In {{the place of the}} space <b>bar</b> <b>key</b> on a conventional keyboard, there are two additional modifier keys, operated with thumbs - one of them is used to enter the alternate character marked, and the other is used for voiced sounds. The semi-voiced sounds are entered using either the conventional shift key operated by the little finger, or take place of the voiced sound for characters not having a voiced variant.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The authors present 3 {{cases of}} {{asphyxia}} caused by atypical compression {{of the neck}} by the metal bed bars fitted {{at the sides of}} the bed to prevent falling out. These occurred in 3 elderly women living in nursing homes, confined to bed by severe neuro-psychiatric disturbances. In all 3 cases, the minor nature of the skin lesions and absence of blood infiltrations in the anatomic structures of the neck had made it difficult to diagnose the cause of death. Inspection of the rest homes, together with the autopsy findings (acute pulmonary emphysema, conjunctival petechiae, and dark, fluid blood), enabled identification of asphyxia as the cause of death and its causal agent as the bed <b>bars.</b> <b>Key</b> Words: atypical compression of the neck, nursing home, bed bars, vagal refle...|$|R
40|$|We {{have used}} an {{acoustic}} technique to pressurize liquid helium 4 up to 163 ± 20 bar.

This is also far above 65 bar, the prediction of the standard theory for homogeneous nucleation of solid helium. However, no solidification was observed. We discuss our experimental method and the metastability of liquid helium at such very large overpressures.

40|$|We {{examine and}} model {{analogue}} recordings from 6 early mechanical seismographs for the 1910 June 16 earthquake at Adra, Southern Spain. Modern standard, time-domain analysis techniques {{were applied to}} the historical data to estimate the source parameters of the event: The regional sparse network data were inverted for the deviatoric seismic moment tensor. The best moment tensor solution corresponds to a M 0 = 1. 50 · 1018 Nm, M W 6. 1 oblique strikeslip event at 16 km depth. Our preferred faulting solution is: strike 122 ◦, dip 80 ◦, rake − 137 ◦, in very good agreement with available neo- and seismotectonic data. The source time function of this earthquake was estimated by deconvolving recordings of a M W 5. 5 aftershock that occurred the same day. The time function indicates a total rupture time of 4. 5 s, corresponding to estimates for mainshock rupture length of 12 km, and stress drop of 29 <b>bar.</b> <b>Key</b> words: historical seismograms, moment tensor inversion, source time function, waveform modelling...|$|E

Hayes’ laid back delivery and gorgeous arrangements are still breathtaking, and the album remains a quintessential slice of ‘70s soul.” ...|$|R

40|$|The role of {{colour vision}} in night-active cats {{has not been}} elucidated {{completely}} hitherto. In order to assess the colour sensitivity in cat cortical neurons we used large isoluminant computer-generated monochromatic and polychromatic background stimuli which were superimposed on moving and stationary (on/off) light bars. Background stimuli were moved at different speeds either inphase or antiphase. The modulatory effect of the visual noise on the neuronal bar was the primary objective of the study. The maximum amplitudes of some 40 % of the neurons tested was influenced by both moving and stationary bars. About two thirds of amplitude-sensitive cells showed aldo altered di-rection selectivity. Latencies and field widths, on the other hand, {{turned out to be}} rather stable. The retino-cortical conduction time was not influenced either. In conclusion, a large portion of cat cor-tical visual neurons is remarkably sensitive to the spectral composition of the visual noise process surrounding the stimulating light <b>bar.</b> <b>Key</b> words: colour vison, cat, monochromatic and polychromatic visual noise.
