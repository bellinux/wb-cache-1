Particularly, the economy grew twice as rapidly as the projected rate, and the government continues to implement a public expenditure policy that is focused on social sectors and infrastructure development. As a result, compared with PRSP targets, a better performance on poverty and inequality reduction has been recorded in 2003.

It {{is the first}} comprehensive attempt to quantify the extent of assistance to tourism on a comparable basis to that for other industries in Australia. While care is needed in interpreting the results, the estimates suggest that tourism receives a lower rate of Australian Government assistance than the average for the manufacturing and primary sectors, but more than for other service industries. Assistance measures include destination marketing and support for high-profile cultural or sporting events, and funding for art galleries, national parks and transport.

40|$|Many {{qualified}} {{analysts are}} unconvinced {{by the case}} advanced by US economists Card and Krueger (C and K) that, within limits, the employment effects of raising the minimum wage will be zero or positive. Indeed, examinations of C and K arguments and studies by such analysts reveal many flaws and generally support the conventional view that minimum wages reduce employment. Using the minimum wage to assist low wage earners is also an inefficient and ineffective welfare measure as higher income groups benefit from it more than others. Eliminating the AIRC’s {{role in determining the}} minimum wage and moving to a market-determined wage could be made more politically acceptable if accompanied by some form of additional social security assistance linked to and encouraging work for low wage earners in low-income households, and protecting their living standard.

Except for its agricultural orientation, it is {{unrelated to the}} agricultural I-O data disaggregation discussed in sub-chapters 8. A and 8. B of this chapter. Rather, it arises from concerns that arose with the GTAP 5 Data Base, that in the data for European Union (EU) member countries there were considerable inaccuracies in levels and international distribution of agricultural production, and, consequently, in the <b>budgetary</b> cost of <b>assistance.</b> This led to problems in analysis of EU agricultural reform. Investigation revealed that these inaccuracies largely reflected discrepancies between the representation of agriculture in the contributed I-O tables for EU member countries (van Leeuwen, 2002) and EUROSTAT production data relied upon by EU stakeholders. These arose partly from differences in reference years (the I-O data being older), but more from basic data differences. In response, a special version of the GTAP Data Base was prepared for exclusive use of GTAP Consortium members, in which the agricultural production levels in EU member countries were revised. The revisions were made not within the data base construction procedure itself bu...|$|R
40|$|This review {{contains}} the Productivity Commission 2 ̆ 7 s latest quantitative estimates of Australian Government assistance to industry. 	draws attention to areas of government intervention {{that could be}} impeding economic growth 	identifies recent developments in industry assistance and international trade policy 	includes a chapter on the industry assistance aspects of defence procurement. Key points: 	Government assistance to industry is provided through an array of measures including tariffs, budgetary outlays, tax concessions, and restrictions on competition. 	 		This benefits the industry receiving it, but comes {{at a cost to}} other industries, taxpayers or consumers. A critical issue is whether the benefits accruing to industry outweigh the costs. 	 	 	Estimated tariff assistance to industry was 7. 8 billion in 2012 - 13 in gross terms, accruing overwhelmingly to manufacturing. Budget and tax related support was worth a further 7. 8 billion, thus total gross assistance was 15. 6 billion. 	After deducting the cost penalty of tariffs on imported inputs (7. 1 billion, two thirds incurred by services industries) net assistance to industry was 8. 5 billion. 	<b>Budgetary</b> <b>assistance</b> in 2012 - 13 was about 2. 2 billion less than in 2011 - 12. The largest reductions were from the winding down of transitional assistance afforded by the Energy Security Fund (1 billion), the Coal Sector Jobs Package (219 million) and the Steel Transformation Plan (164 million). 	Since November 2013, the current Government has announced, amongst other things, that it would: 	 		reduce funding to motor vehicle manufacturing between 2015 – 2017 by 500 million, not provide a debt guarantee or line of credit to Qantas, nor provide assistance requested by processing company SPC Ardmona, but would proceed with support to Cadbury for a tourist facility. 	 	 	Australia recently agreed to bilateral trade agreements with Korea and Japan. Trade agreements can distort comparative advantage between nations and consequently reduce efficient resource allocation. 	 		The rules of origin in Australia 2 ̆ 7 s nine bilateral agreements differ widely, are likely to impede competition and add to the compliance costs of firms engaging in trade. 	 	 	Government outlays on defence capability represent one of the largest discretionary items in the Commonwealth 2 ̆ 7 s budget. 	 		Defence industry assistance includes cost premiums for local purchasing preferences and budgetary support for skilling, research and exporting (with expenditures up to 500 million directly and indirectly benefiting industry). 		Significant cost premiums can also be incurred by choosing to modify off-the-shelf equipment or pursuing bespoke designs. 	 	 	To be justified, cost premiums and defence industry assistance need to be commensurate with any additional security and operational benefits. Publishing these additional costs and benefits would assist understanding of apparently huge cost differentials. 	The efficiency and effectiveness of direct defence industry assistance programs could benefit from independent scrutiny.
