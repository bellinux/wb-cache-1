The videos, produced by LTS Productions, have been compiled into a DVD titled St. Clair Tunnel Documentary Collection. Footage shows all phases of construction including excavation, segment production, tunnel <b>boring</b> machine <b>assembly,</b> mining operations, shaft construction, and the breakthrough of Excalibore into Port Huron. The narration addresses the methods, materials, design and engineering challenges of building the tunnel. Highlights include a ride into the old tunnel and a full, summit-to-summit test run through the newly completed second tunnel.|$|R
5000|$|The {{majority}} of failures seen {{are the result}} of poor installation or operation of the water system. The most common failure seen in the last 20 years is pitting corrosion in cold water tubes, also known as Type 1 pitting. These failures are usually the result of poor commissioning practice although a significant number are initiated by flux left in the <b>bore</b> after <b>assembly</b> of soldered joints. Prior to about 1970 {{the most common cause of}} Type 1 pitting was carbon films left in the bore by the manufacturing process.|$|R

40|$|The {{potential}} for primary water {{stress corrosion cracking}} (PWSCC) of large diameter austenitic nickel alloy components and their associated welds presents a particular problem for the nuclear industry due to {{a limited number of}} available options for mitigating or repairing large bore pressure boundary components such as reactor vessel, reactor coolant pump, and steam generator inlet or outlet nozzles. While a full structural weld overlay (FSWOL), as governed by ASME Code Case N- 740, is commonly used to mitigate and repair small (4 ”) to medium (10 ”) <b>bore</b> piping <b>assemblies</b> employing Alloy 82 / 182 dissimilar metal welds, the large amount of weld metal that would be have to be deposited on large components (and the associated impact on outage schedule) makes this an unattractive strategy for managing the degradation of Alloy 60...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "4032" [...] {{performance}} piston alloy has a {{silicon content}} of approximately 11%. This {{means that it}} expands less than a piston with no silicon, but since the silicon is fully alloyed on a molecular level (eutectic), the alloy is less brittle and more flexible than a stock hypereutectic [...] "smog" [...] (low compression) piston. These pistons can survive mild detonation with less damage than stock pistons. 4032 and hypereutectic alloys have a low coefficient of thermal expansion, allowing tighter piston to cylinder <b>bore</b> fit at <b>assembly</b> temperature.|$|R
5000|$|The weapon has a suppression-ready fluted barrel, {{which is}} lighter and cools better than {{previous}} M4 barrels. It is {{claimed to have}} [...] "markedly better" [...] accuracy. To improve reliability, Colt used an articulating link piston (ALP) which [...] "reduces the inherent stress in the piston stroke by allowing for deflection and thermal expansion". In traditional gas piston operating systems, {{the force of the}} piston striking the bolt carrier can push the bolt carrier downwards and into the wall of the buffer tube, leading to accelerated wear and even chipped metal. This is known as carrier tilt. The ALP allows the operating rod to wiggle to correct for the downward pressure on the bolt and transfers the force straight backwards in line with the <b>bore</b> and buffer <b>assembly,</b> eliminating the carrier tilt. This relieves stress on parts and helps to increase accuracy.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "2618" [...] {{performance}} piston alloy {{has less}} than 2% silicon, and {{could be described as}} hypo (under) eutectic. This alloy is capable of experiencing the most detonation and abuse while suffering the least amount of damage. Pistons made of this alloy are also typically made thicker and heavier because of their most common applications in commercial diesel engines. Both because of the higher than normal temperatures that these pistons experience in their usual application, and the higher coefficient of thermal expansion due to low-silicon content causing greater thermal growth, these pistons require a larger piston to cylinder <b>bore</b> clearance at <b>assembly</b> temperatures. This leads to a condition known as [...] "piston slap" [...] which is when the piston rocks in the cylinder and it causes an audible tapping noise that continues until the engine has warmed to operational temperatures, expanding the piston and reducing piston to cylinder wall clearance.|$|R
60|$|But {{perhaps the}} most {{remarkable}} Goose in that assembly, as decidedly {{he was the most}} popular, was old Pan. He traced his birth to the mighty blood of the great Pancabinets, whose noble name he still proudly bore. Every one liked old Pancabinet, and though he did not now possess, and never had possessed, those grand oratorical powers which distinguished so highly the worthy Geese above mentioned, no Goose ever rose upon his legs more sure of respectful attention. The sway which he <b>bore</b> in that <b>assembly</b> was very wonderful, for he was an old man, and there were there divers Geese of unruly spirit. Lately he had associated himself much with our friend Robinson, for which many blamed him. But old Pancabinet generally knew what he was about, and having recognized the tremendous power of the young merchant from Bishopsgate Street, was full sure that he could get on better with him than he could against him.|$|R

5000|$|From {{its ancient}} past the Basoche had also {{preserved}} certain picturesque forms and names. It {{was called the}} [...] "kingdom of the Basoche," [...] {{and for a long}} time its chief, elected each year in general <b>assembly,</b> <b>bore</b> the title of [...] "king." [...] This he had to give up towards the end of the 16th century, by order, it is said, of Henry III, and was thenceforth called the [...] "chancellor." [...] At this time it is said that the order included 6,000 clerks. The Basoche had besides its maîtres des requêtes, a grand court-crier, a referendary, an advocate-general, a procureur-général, a chaplain, etc. In early days, and until the first half of the 16th century, it was organized in companies in a military manner and held periodical reviews or parades (montres), sometimes taking up arms in the king's service in time of war. Of this there survived later only an annual cavalcade, when the members of the Basoche went to the royal forest of Bondy to cut the maypole, which they afterwards set up in the courtyard of the Palais de Justice, to the sound of tambourines and trumpets. We hear also of satirical and literary entertainments given by clerks of the Palais de Justice, and of the moralities played by them in public, which form an important element in the history of the national theatre; but at the end of the 16th century these performances were restricted to the great hall of the Palais.|$|R
