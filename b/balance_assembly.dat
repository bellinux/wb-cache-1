Beyond that, {{it had a}} stockpile of 23 1960s and 1970s era engines. Kuznetsov no longer manufactures the engines, so Orbital sought to buy RD-180 engines. Because NPO Energomash's contract with United Launch Alliance prevented this, Orbital sued ULA alleging anti-trust violations. Aerojet offered to work with Kuznetsov to restart production of new NK-33 engines, to assure Orbital of an ongoing supply. However, manufacturing defects in the engine's liquid oxygen turbopump and design flaws in the hydraulic <b>balance</b> <b>assembly</b> and thrust bearings were proposed as two possible causes of the 2014 Antares launch failure. As announced on 5 November 2014, Orbital decided to drop the AJ-26 first stage from the Antares and source an alternative engine.

40|$|A ceramic {{cylinder}} {{has been}} developed as an accessory to a standard DuPont 951 Thermogravimetric Analyzer to study weight changes of solid samples in corrosive atmospheres. This device has two purposes to be fulfilled at higher temperatures (G 9 OOOC) and higher gas flow rates (G 14 cm s-l) : (1) preventing mixing of reactant and purge gases {{at the location of}} the sample; and (2) keeping the corrosive reactant gas from the balance sections. EXPERIMENTAL For corrosive atmospheres such as nitrogen mixtures with sulphur dioxide etc., the instruction manual of the DuPont 951 Thermogravimetric Analyzer [l] advises the installation of a gas inlet tube on the furnace tube between the furnace and the balance housing. A stopcock is sealed to the, Pyrex bell jar to purge the back end of the <b>balance</b> <b>assembly.</b> The normal gas inlet, located on the balance housing, is also flushed with the inert gas. The reactive gas is admitted through the side arm of the furnace tube so that it will flow to the sample along with the purge gas. The main disadvantage of this system is that the purge gas mixes with the reactant gas around the sample making it difficult to establish a constant and reproducible concentration of the latter. To avoid this, we worked with a different modification. This does not require a complicated double furnace tube, as described by Ruth et al. [2] and Ulerich et al. [3]. The reactive gas mixture is admitted from the end (Fig. 1) and leaves the sample housing through the side arm, which now has the function of ou,tlet.

40|$|The design {{feasibility}} study is documented {{of a single}} cylinder, free piston Stirling engine/linear alternator (FPSE/LA) power module generating 150 kW-electric (kW sub e), and {{the determination of the}} module's maximum feasible power level. The power module configuration was specified to be a single cylinder (single piston, single displacer) FPSE/LA, with tuning capacitors if required. The design requirements were as follows: (1) Maximum electrical power output; (2) Power module thermal efficiency equal to or greater than 20 percent at a specific mass of 5 to 8 kg/kW(sub e); (3) Heater wall temperature/cooler wall temperature = 1050 K/ 525 K; (4) Sodium heat-pipe heat transport system, pumped loop NaK (sodium-potassium eutectic mixture) rejection system; (5) Maximum power module vibration amplitude = 0. 0038 cm; and (6) Design life = 7 years (60, 000 hr). The results show that a single cylinder FPSE/LA is capable of meeting program goals and has attractive scaling attributes over the power range from 25 to 150 kW(sub e). Scaling beyond the 150 kW(sub e) power level, the power module efficiency falls and the power module specific mass reaches 10 kg/kW(sub e) at a power output of 500 kW(sub e). A discussion of scaling rules for the engine, alternator, and heat transport systems is presented, along with {{a detailed description of the}} conceptual design of a 150 kW(sub e) power module that meets the requirements. Included is a discussion of the design of a dynamic balance system. A parametric study of power module performance conducted over the power output range of 25 to 150 kW(sub e) for temperature ratios of 1. 7, 2. 0, 2. 5, and 3. 0 is presented and discussed. The results show that as the temperature ratio decreases, the efficiency falls and specific mass increases. At a temperature ratio of 1. 7, the 150 kW(sub e) power module cannot satisfy both efficiency and specific mass goals. As the power level increases from 25 to 150 kW(sub e) at a fixed temperature ratio, power module efficiency is seen to increase slightly, but at the expense of increased specific mass. An empirical equation relating power module thermal efficiency as a function of power module specific mass, power output, and temperature ratio is developed. Alternative configurations to the single cylinder, direct coupled linear alternator approach are also evaluated, but are shown to have technical drawbacks that lessen their attractiveness. The dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>assembly</b> mass (moving mass and structure) represents 20 to 30 percent of the total single cylinder power module mass. Joining two modules in a balanced opposed configuration eliminates the need for the balancer, and a hot end junction can be made without significant addition of structural mass. Recommendations are made for evaluation of advanced heat pipe concepts, tests of radial flow heat exchangers, and evaluation of high temperature alternator materials...|$|E

40|$|Two-sided {{assembly}} lines are often designed to produce large-sized products, such as automobiles, trucks and buses. In {{this type of}} a production line, both left-side and right-side of the line are used in parallel.

However, in real life applications, especially in manual assembly lines, the tasks may have varying execution times defined as a probability distribution.

Today's ever increasing product variety often impedes reliable prognoses for individual models.
