5|$|An osteological {{examination}} of the bones showed them to be in generally good condition and largely complete except for the missing feet, {{which may have been}} destroyed by Victorian building work. It was immediately apparent that the body had suffered major injuries, and further evidence of wounds was found as the skeleton was cleaned. The skull shows signs of two lethal injuries; the base {{of the back of the}} skull had been completely cut away by a <b>bladed</b> weapon, which would have exposed the brain, and another <b>bladed</b> weapon had been thrust through the right side of the skull, striking the inside of the left side through the brain. Elsewhere on the skull, a blow from a pointed weapon had penetrated the crown of the head. <b>Bladed</b> weapons had clipped the skull and sheared off layers of bone, without penetrating it. Other holes in the skull and lower jaw were found to be consistent with dagger wounds to the chin and cheek. The multiple wounds on the king’s skull indicated that he was not wearing his helmet, which he may have removed or lost when he was on foot after his horse had become stuck in the marsh. One of his right ribs had been cut by a sharp implement, as had the pelvis. There was no evidence of the withered arm that afflicted the character in William Shakespeare's play Richard III.|$|E
5|$|Upgraded anti-submarine {{version for}} the Royal Navy, based on Australian Mk 50. More {{powerful}} Gnome H.1400-1 engines, six <b>bladed</b> tail rotor and upgraded avionics (including new Type 2069 dipping sonar), and improved navigation and communications equipment; 21 new build aircraft plus conversions from HAS.1s. Some were later converted for AEW (Airborne Early Warning) duties.|$|E
5|$|A long, straight-bladed dagger (pugio) was the gladiator's final weapon. A {{tombstone}} {{found in}} Romania shows a retiarius holding a dagger with four spikes (known as a quadrenseach spike {{at the corner}} of a square guard) instead of the usual <b>bladed</b> dagger. This was previously thought to be an artistic invention or perhaps a ceremonial weapon but a recently excavated femur bone from a gladiator graveyard in Ephesus has wounds consistent with the use of such a weapon.|$|E

5000|$|... #Caption: <b>Blade</b> {{geometry}} and hollowness. <b>Blade</b> A is less hollow than <b>blade</b> B, since <b>blade</b> A has more material than <b>blade</b> B. Visually, {{the belly of}} <b>blade</b> B is located higher than the belly of <b>blade</b> A, indicating {{a higher degree of}} hollowness. Profile C represents the extra-hollow ground <b>blade.</b> The wedge profile on the right is used as reference of zero hollowness.|$|R
5|$|Wind {{turbines}} {{are affected}} by wind shear. Vertical wind-speed profiles result in different wind speeds at the blades nearest to the ground level compared to those {{at the top of}} blade travel, and this in turn affects the turbine operation. This low level wind shear can create a large bending moment in the shaft of a two <b>bladed</b> turbine when the blades are vertical. The reduced wind shear over water means shorter and less expensive wind turbine towers can be used in shallow seas.|$|E
5|$|There is {{evidence}} of human activity on the site pre-dating the Iron Age, {{as far back as}} 8,0006,000BC. During this period Mellor may have been a knap site where flint tools were produced, and also may have been a seasonal camp. Over 200lithics have been recovered and range from the early to the late Mesolithic. A high proportion of the flints are <b>bladed</b> tools, indicating that the people who produced them were hunter gatherers. Bronze Age artefacts are rare on the site, and there is no definitive indication of habitation in this period. Despite this, {{it is likely that the}} long-term habitation of the site had its roots in the late Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the razing of the Citadel of Saigon, Định organised his local levies into a guerrilla force that initially numbered between 500 and 1000 men, operating out of Thuan Kieu. They were armed with <b>bladed</b> spears, fire lances, knives, sabres, bamboo sticks and swords, trained and on call as necessary. As a local notable who was respected for his leadership and military ability, Định naturally assumed a lead role in the partisan movement that responded to Tự Đức's appeals for popular resistance against European aggression. In the initial phase of the conflict, the local militias concentrated on evacuating the populace from areas that had {{been taken over by}} the French, while urging those who chose to stay to not cooperate with the Europeans. Snipers were deployed into French areas to assassinate isolated soldiers.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. For a {{centrifugal}} fan impeller the <b>blade</b> shape {{can be defined}} using two parameters: the <b>blade</b> angle and the <b>blade</b> width. There are different design methods depending on the assumption made on both the <b>blade</b> width and the <b>blade</b> angle. In this paper four design methods are presented: constant <b>blade</b> width and variable <b>blade</b> angle; hyperbolic <b>blade</b> width and variable <b>blade</b> angle; hyperbolic <b>blade</b> width and constant <b>blade</b> angle; linear <b>blade</b> width and variable <b>blade</b> angle. The sequential algorithm for solving the characteristic system of equations, which defines the <b>blade</b> geometry, is implemented in a MATLAB script file, for which principal code lines are explained. In the solving process of the characteristic system of equations for all four design methods considered, different relationships for relative velocity are obtained. The comparative graphical analysis of impeller <b>blades</b> obtained {{by all of the}} four design methods, as well as the <b>blade</b> geometry parameters is presented...|$|R
50|$|A <b>blade</b> {{connector}} {{is a type}} {{of single}} wire connection using a flat conductive <b>blade</b> which is inserted into a <b>blade</b> receptacle. Usually both <b>blade</b> connector and <b>blade</b> receptacle have wires attached to them either through of the wire to the <b>blade</b> or crimping of the <b>blade</b> to the wire. In some cases the <b>blade</b> is an integral manufactured part of a component (such as a switch or a speaker unit), and a <b>blade</b> receptacle is pushed onto the <b>blade</b> to form a connection.|$|R
50|$|A <b>blade</b> server is a stripped-down server {{computer}} with a modular design optimized to minimize the use of physical space and energy. <b>Blade</b> servers have many components removed to save space, minimize power consumption and other considerations, while still having all the functional components {{to be considered a}} computer. Unlike a rack-mount server, a <b>blade</b> server needs a <b>blade</b> enclosure, which can hold multiple <b>blade</b> servers, providing services such as power, cooling, networking, various interconnects and management. Together, <b>blades</b> and the <b>blade</b> enclosure, form a <b>blade</b> system. Different <b>blade</b> providers have differing principles regarding what to include in the <b>blade</b> itself, and in the <b>blade</b> system as a whole.|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game, players can use a wide variety of weapons, {{including}} plastic bags, baseball bats, crowbars and a variety of <b>bladed</b> items. Later in the game, firearms become available (which cannot be used for executions). Should players take damage, their health depletes; health can be restored through the use of painkillers, which are available throughout each scene. Players also have a stamina meter which depletes as they sprint, but automatically replenishes when remaining stationary. Manhunt also makes use of the PlayStation 2's optional USB Microphone and the Xbox Live microphone feature on the Xbox in their respective versions of the game. When such a device is connected, players can use the sound of their own voice to distract in-game enemies. This adds an extra element to the stealth aspect of the game, as players must refrain from making noises such as coughing as these sounds too can attract the attention of any nearby hunters.|$|E

A defence exists under s.49(5)(b) of the act for pointed or <b>bladed</b> articles carried for religious reasons. Section 49A of the same act creates the offence of possessing a <b>bladed</b> or pointed article in a school, with s.49A(4)(c) again creating a defence when the article is carried for religious reasons.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{designing}} wind turbine <b>blades</b> {{is to improve}} the power capture ability. Since rotor control technology is cur-rently limited to controlling rotational speed and <b>blade</b> pitch, an increasing concern has been given to morphing <b>blades.</b> In this paper, a simplified morphing <b>blade</b> is introduced, which has a linear twist distribution along the span and a shape that can be controlled by adjusting the twist of the <b>blade’s</b> root and tip. To evaluate the performance of wind turbine <b>blades,</b> a numerical code based on the <b>blade</b> element mo-mentum theory is developed and validated. The <b>blade</b> of the NREL Phase VI wind turbine is taken as a reference <b>blade</b> and has a fixed pitch. The optimization problems associ-ated with the control of the morphing <b>blade</b> and a <b>blade</b> with pitch control are formulated. The optimal results show that the morphing <b>blade</b> gives better results than the <b>blade</b> wit...|$|R
5000|$|Shrouded turbine. Many {{turbine rotor}} <b>blades</b> have {{shrouding}} at the top, which interlocks {{with that of}} adjacent <b>blades,</b> to increase damping and thereby reduce <b>blade</b> flutter. In large land-based electricity generation steam turbines, the shrouding is often complemented, especially in the long <b>blades</b> of a low-pressure turbine, with lacing wires. These wires pass through holes drilled in the <b>blades</b> at suitable distances from the <b>blade</b> root and are usually brazed to the <b>blades</b> {{at the point where}} they pass through. Lacing wires reduce <b>blade</b> flutter in {{the central part of the}} <b>blades.</b> The introduction of lacing wires substantially reduces the instances of <b>blade</b> failure in large or low-pressure turbines.|$|R
50|$|<b>Blade</b> Abilities: <b>Blade</b> {{abilities}} come in {{four types}} (<b>blade,</b> double <b>blade,</b> multiblade, and double multiblade), each representing {{the number of}} <b>blades</b> (a special symbol which may be rolled on the dice) which may be spent on the ability: one, two, unlimited, or an unlimited even number respectively. All rolled <b>blades</b> must be spent, which allows {{for the existence of}} <b>blade</b> abilities which have negative effects.|$|R

25|$|Crystal habit {{refers to}} the overall shape of crystal. Several terms are used to {{describe}} this property. Common habits include acicular, which described needlelike crystals like in natrolite, <b>bladed,</b> dendritic (tree-pattern, common in native copper), equant, which is typical of garnet, prismatic (elongated in one direction), and tabular, which differs from <b>bladed</b> habit in that the former is platy whereas the latter has a defined elongation. Related to crystal form, the quality of crystal faces is diagnostic of some minerals, especially with a petrographic microscope. Euhedral crystals have a defined external shape, while anhedral crystals do not; those intermediate forms are termed subhedral.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} rotor <b>blade</b> {{dynamics}} on aerodynamic and structural loads is examined for a conventional, main- rotor helicopter using both a comprehensive rotorcraft analysis (CAMRAD) and night test data. The impact of <b>blade</b> dynamics on <b>blade</b> section lift-coefficient time histories is studied by comparing predictions from both a rigid <b>blade</b> analysis and an elastic <b>blade</b> analysis with helicopter flight test data. The elastic <b>blade</b> analysis better predicts high-frequency behavior of section lift. In addition, {{components of the}} <b>blade</b> angle of attack, such as elastic <b>blade</b> twist, <b>blade</b> nap rate, <b>blade</b> slope velocity, and inflow, are examined {{as a function of}} <b>blade</b> mode. Elastic <b>blade</b> motion affects the <b>blade</b> angle of attack by a few tenths of a degree, and up to the sixth rotor harmonic. A similar study of the influence of <b>blade</b> dynamics on bending and torsion moments was also conducted. The modal analysis of the predicted <b>blade</b> structural loads suggested that five elastic bending deg of freedom (four flap and one lag) and three elastic torsion deg of freedom contributed to calculations of the <b>blade</b> structural loads. However, when structural bending load predictions from several elastic <b>blade</b> analyses were compared with flight test data, an elastic <b>blade</b> model consisting of only three elastic bending modes (first and second flap, and first lag), and two elastic torsion modes was found to be sufficient for maximum correlation...|$|R

This paper provides a review on the condition monitoring techniques and the most suitable signal analysis methods to detect and diagnose the health condition of <b>blades</b> in turbomachinery. In this paper, <b>blade</b> faults are categorised into five types {{in accordance with their}} nature and characteristics, namely, <b>blade</b> rubbing, <b>blade</b> fatigue failure, <b>blade</b> deformations (twisting, creeping, corrosion, and erosion), <b>blade</b> fouling, and loose <b>blade.</b> Reviews on characteristics and the specific diagnostic methods to detect each type of <b>blade</b> faults are also presented. This paper also aims to provide a reference in selecting the most suitable approaches to monitor the health condition of <b>blades</b> in turbomachinery...|$|R
50|$|A small {{diameter}} saw <b>blade</b> is {{less expensive}} and requires less torque to drive.A thinner saw <b>blade</b> is wasting less material and needs less energy to turn.Therefore, it is desired to use smaller diameter drive hubs for <b>blade</b> mounting and thinner <b>blades</b> {{to be able to}} saw larger diameter material with smaller diameter saw <b>blades.</b> These criteria however weaken the lateral stiffness of the <b>blade</b> and the <b>blade</b> may vibrate more due to the large diameter / <b>blade</b> thickness ratio.|$|R

25|$|Kayaks are {{generally}} differentiated from canoes by the sitting {{position of the}} paddler {{and the number of}} blades on the paddle. In a kayak the paddler faces forward, legs in front, using a double <b>bladed</b> paddle. In a canoe the paddler faces forward and sits or kneels in the boat, using a single <b>bladed</b> paddle. In some parts of the world, such as the United Kingdom, kayaks are considered a subtype of canoe. Continental European and British canoeing clubs and associations of the 19th Century used craft similar to kayaks, but referred to them as canoes.|$|E
40|$|In the {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines, <b>blades</b> {{are the most}} important parts of the wind turbine. Wind Turbine {{is one of the most}} useful non-conventional energy sources in today’s energy crisis scenario. But the initial cost of the Wind Turbine plant is very high. The manufacturing cost of the Wind Turbine <b>blade</b> is about 15 - 20 % of the Wind Turbine plant cost. Different types of loads acting on the Wind Turbine <b>blade</b> are static loads, dynamic loads, fatigue loads etc. Rotation of wind <b>blades</b> mainly depends on the wind speed and the direction of wind. To have optimum number of rotations of the <b>blades</b> the geometry of wind turbine <b>blades</b> are very important. The main parameters in the geometry of wind turbine <b>blades</b> are total length of the <b>blades,</b> cord length of the <b>blades</b> and the twist angle of the <b>blades.</b> Effect of the length of the <b>blade,</b> cord length of the <b>blade</b> and effect of twist angle of the <b>blade</b> on the performance of wind turbine <b>blade</b> are analyzed. The twist angle of the <b>blade</b> is a more sensitive parameter of the wind turbine <b>blades.</b> Little variation in twist angle has more effect on the performance of wind turbine <b>blades.</b> Constrained Gradient (Steepest ascent method) method is used for fatigue life optimization of the <b>blade.</b> The twist angle is very sensitive to the fatigue life of the <b>blade</b> than the chord length and the <b>blade</b> length. The fatigue life increases exponentially with the increase in twist angle, while there is parabolic relation between the fatigue life of the <b>blade</b> and the chord length. The fatigue life decreases with increase in the <b>blade</b> length linearly. Due to increas...|$|R
