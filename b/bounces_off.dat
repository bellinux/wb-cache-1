5|$|Levels in {{the game}} include a mixture of platforming, {{swimming}} and on-rails levels. They are based around several returning themes including forests, cliff-sides, factories and mountain tops. The level design is more diverse compared to its predecessors, which includes more complex puzzles and obstacles. Every level has an enemy called a Koin; each of these enemies bears the DK Coin of their respective level, holding it as a shield. As these enemies always face towards the player, they must be defeated by throwing a steel barrel over them so it <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> a wall behind {{them in order to}} strike them from behind. The game overworld is also more complex, allowing players to explore between each area instead of forcing them along a linear path. To achieve this, the game includes several vehicles such as a speedboat and hovercraft which can be used to traverse the overworld and access different worlds.|$|E
25|$|The seam of a cricket ball {{can also}} be used to produce {{different}} trajectories through the air, with the technique known as swing bowling, or to produce sideways movement as it <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> the pitch, with the technique known as seam bowling.|$|E
25|$|Present systems {{based on}} imaging CMOS cameras can detect and respond {{appropriately}} to leading and oncoming vehicles while disregarding streetlights, road signs, and other spurious signals. Camera-based beam selection was first released in 2005 on the Jeep Grand Cherokee, {{and has since}} then been incorporated into comprehensive driver assistance systems by automakers worldwide.

25|$|Ensemble tears {{can occur}} when musicians {{on the field}} listen to the pit. Because of the way sound waves travel, the sound pit {{produces}} first <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> the back bleachers and then is heard by the ensemble. By the time the ensemble hears them, they are already late in timing. Because of this reason, the norm is to ignore the pit and let them listen to the ensemble for timing.|$|E
25|$|The team in {{possession}} of the ring has 30 seconds to shoot, {{it is not always}} played this way with the younger girls (Active start, and U10), or it gives up possession to the other team. The shot clock is reset when possession of the ring changes teams, when the ring stops in the goaltender's crease, or when the ring <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> the goalie. The shot clock is only applied in competitive levels, starting at the petite level (U12).|$|E
25|$|A yorker ball <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> {{the pitch}} {{right in front}} of (or is aimed at the toes of) the batsman's feet, an area known as the block hole. Because of the usual stance of the batsman and the {{regulation}} length of the cricket bat the bat is not usually held near the ground while the batsman prepares to strike the ball, so playing a yorker requires the batsman to alter the height of his or her bat very quickly after detecting a yorker has been bowled. This is difficult, and the yorker can often squeeze through the gap and break the wicket. Successfully playing this type of delivery is also known as digging out a yorker.|$|E

500|$|When Sonic {{reaches the}} end of Act 1 or Act 2 of a zone while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a [...] "Special Stage." [...] In the Special Stages, Sonic is {{continually}} curled up in his Spin Attack animation, and <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze. In these levels, the player earns a continue with each 50 rings collected, but the main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald hidden within the maze. [...] Colliding {{with any of the}} blocks marked [...] "GOAL" [...] will instantly end the level.|$|E
500|$|When Michael Scott (Steve Carell) {{repeatedly}} disrupts Darryl Philbin's (Craig Robinson) warehouse {{safety training}} session, Lonny Collins (Patrice O'Neal) and Darryl mock the office workers' safety session in retaliation, claiming that office work does not entail physical danger. Offended by Darryl's disdain for office safety training, Michael decides {{to demonstrate the}} risk of depression and suicide by jumping off the roof, landing on a hidden trampoline. When Michael tests out the trampoline by dropping a watermelon from the roof, it <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> and hits an office worker's car, prompting it {{to be replaced by}} a bouncy castle hidden from the general view of the parking lot. [...] From the roof of the building, Michael talks dramatically about the dangers of depression. When the bouncy castle is discovered, Jim and Pam realize that Michael is [...] "going to kill himself pretending to kill himself." [...] The employees collectively talk Michael down from the roof, with Darryl doing most of the talking, to assure Michael that he is brave simply by living as himself. At the end, the car that was hit by the watermelon is revealed to be Stanley's (Leslie David Baker), who is shocked to see the mess.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} {{demonstrate}} the durability of Radioactive Man #1000, Comic Book Guy pours soda on it, which <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> and instead damages a batch of [...] "lesser" [...] comics. On top of the batch {{is an issue of}} Bongo Comics, a comic book written by Matt Groening, creator of The Simpsons. The comedian Gallagher is shown doing his routine with a watermelon during a flashback. [...] While in The Android's Dungeon, Nelson examines a comic book called The Death of Sad Sack, a reference to both the American comic strip The Sad Sack and the [...] "Death of Superman" [...] story arc. When Homer and Comic Book Guy enter Moe's Tavern, Moe says [...] "Get out and take your Sacagawea dollars with you" [...] to one of his customers. A Sacagawea dollar is a United States dollar coin which has been minted since 2000. After he is thrown out of Moe's Tavern, Comic Book Guy says the word [...] "loneliness" [...] in Klingon, a language used by the fictional Klingons in the Star Trek universe. While arguing with Agnes, Comic Book Guy says [...] "Now I know what ever happened to Baby Jane." [...] The line is a reference to the 1960 suspense novel What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?. Martin's mother tries to sell Comic Book Guy several items relating to the Star Wars film series including Carrie Fisher's [...] "anti-jiggle breast tape", George Lucas' handwritten original script of [...] and a film of a supposed alternate ending for the series where it is revealed that [...] "Luke's father is Chewbacca." ...|$|E

2500|$|There are {{a set of}} articulations {{that most}} {{instruments}} and voices perform in common. They are—from long to short: legato (smooth, connected); tenuto (pressed or played to full notated duration); marcato (accented and detached); staccato ("separated", [...] "detached"); martelé (heavily accented or [...] "hammered"). Many of these can be combined to create certain [...] "in-between" [...] articulations. For example, portato is the combination of tenuto and staccato. Some instruments have unique methods by which to produce sounds, such as spicatto for bowed strings, where the bow <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> the string.|$|E

2500|$|Wrongfulness {{of intent}} also may vary the {{seriousness}} of an offense and possibly reduce the punishment {{but this is not}} always the case. [...] A killing committed with specific intent to kill or with conscious recognition that death or serious bodily harm will result, would be murder, whereas a killing effected by reckless acts lacking such a consciousness could be manslaughter. [...] On the other hand, it matters not who is actually harmed through a defendant's actions. The doctrine of transferred malice means, for instance, that if a man intends to strike a person with his belt, but the belt <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> and hits another, mens rea is transferred from the intended target to the person who actually was struck.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{example of}} {{strictly}} verbal {{differences between the}} two texts can be found in II.1, where the Project Gutenburg text has Lady Teazle rather more pointed in suggesting that Sir Peter can oblige her by making her his [...] "widow" [...] (only implied by her in the 1821 text, leaving him to fill in [...] "My widow, I suppose?" [...] and her to add [...] "Hem! hem!"). Also, interestingly, in Crabtree's recitation of the imaginary duel between Sir Peter and Charles Surface (V.2), the shot of Sir Peter <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> a [...] "little bronze Pliny" [...] in the older version, but the bust is changed to one of [...] "Shakspeare (sic)" [...] in the 1821 text. Many other slight differences of a few words here and there can be found throughout the play (though these do not impact the plot the way that the deletion of Miss Verjuice does).|$|E
2500|$|The figure {{describes}} {{a more complex}} situation where the tossed ball on a turntable <b>bounces</b> <b>off</b> {{the edge of the}} carousel and then returns to the tosser, who catches the ball. The effect of Coriolis force on its trajectory is shown again as seen by two observers: an observer (referred to as the [...] "camera") that rotates with the carousel, and an inertial observer. The figure shows a bird's-eye view based upon the same ball speed on forward and return paths. Within each circle, plotted dots show the same time points. In the left panel, from the camera's viewpoint at the center of rotation, the tosser (smiley face) and the rail both are at fixed locations, and the ball makes a very considerable arc on its travel toward the rail, and takes a more direct route on the way back. From the ball tosser's viewpoint, the ball seems to return more quickly than it went (because the tosser is rotating toward the ball on the return flight).|$|E
