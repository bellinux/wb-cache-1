5|$|According to the plan, {{the type}} of {{consumption}} (i.e. whether agricultural, industrial and civil) will also <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> setting energy prices. The subsidy plan will be implemented in proportion with geographical regions because warm regions consume more electricity during summer while cold regions consume more gas during winter. Finally, the time of consumption (i.e. during peak and off-peak hours) and the consumption demand (i.e. whether it is low or high) will be taken into consideration.|$|E

The instruments used to study weather over the modern time scale, their known error, their immediate environment, and their exposure have changed over the years, which must <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> studying the climate of centuries past.|$|E
5|$|A {{good match}} between {{generation}} and consumption is key for high self consumption, and should <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> deciding where to install solar power {{and how to}} dimension the installation. The match can be improved with batteries or controllable electricity consumption. However, batteries are expensive and profitability may require provision of other services from them besides self consumption increase. Hot water storage tanks with electric heating with heat pumps or resistance heaters can provide low-cost storage for self consumption of solar power. Shiftable loads, such as dishwashers, tumble dryers and washing machines, can provide controllable consumption with only a limited effect on the users, but their effect on self consumption of solar power may be limited.|$|E

25|$|Grignard {{reagents}} {{are produced}} in industry {{for use in}} situ, or for sale. As with a bench-scale, the main problem is that of initiation; {{a portion of a}} previous batch of Grignard reagent is often used as the initiator.

25|$|Direct {{confirmation}} of length contraction {{is hard to}} achieve in practice since {{the dimensions of the}} observed particles are vanishingly small. However, there are indirect confirmations; for example, the behavior of colliding heavy ions can only be explained if their increased density due to Lorentz contraction is considered. Contraction also leads to an increase of the intensity of the Coulomb field perpendicular to the direction of motion, whose effects already have been observed. Consequently, both time dilation and length contraction must <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> conducting experiments in particle accelerators.|$|E
25|$|As of 2010, {{the density}} of {{petroleum}} diesel is about 0.832kg/L (6.943lb/USgal), about 11.6% more than ethanol-free petrol (gasoline), which has a density of about 0.745kg/L (6.217lb/USgal). About 86.1% of the fuel mass is carbon, and when burned, it offers a net heating value of 43.1 MJ/kg as opposed to 43.2 MJ/kg for gasoline. However, due to the higher density, diesel offers a higher volumetric energy density at 35.86 MJ/L (128,700BTU/USgal) vs. 32.18 MJ/L (115,500BTU/USgal) for gasoline, some 11% higher, which should <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> comparing the fuel efficiency by volume. The CO2 emissions from diesel are 73.25 g/MJ, just slightly lower than for gasoline at 73.38 g/MJ.|$|E
25|$|While the PRC and ROC {{agreed in}} {{principle}} on opening the Three Links, there were overriding concerns.

The Council stated that the Three links would only <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> the PRC stopped its animosity against ROC sovereignty and improved the cross-strait relationship. The PRC government considers the cross-strait flights as domestic flights, according to the One China Policy. However, the ROC's Democratic Progressive Party government in Taiwan regarded this position the same as recognising Taiwan (ROC) {{as a part of the}} PRC and thus would compromise the ROC sovereignty.|$|E

25|$|Neglecting {{electrical}} inefficiency, {{the antenna}} gain {{is equal to}} the directive gain, which is 1.5 (1.76 dBi) for a short dipole, increasing to 1.64 (2.15 dBi) for a half-wave dipole. For a 5/4 wave dipole the gain further increases to about 5.2 dBi, making this length desirable for that reason even though the antenna is then off-resonance. Longer dipoles than that have radiation patterns that are multi-lobed, with poorer gain (unless they are much longer) even along the strongest lobe. Other enhancements to the dipole (such as including a corner reflector or an array of dipoles) can <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> more substantial directivity is desired. Such antenna designs, although based on the half-wave dipole, generally acquire their own names.|$|E
25|$|Like {{any other}} {{haemostasis}} evaluating method, TEM (and thrombelastography) have limitations which need to <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> interpreting the results. The typical assays are not responsive {{for the effect}} of von Willebrand factor or platelet antagonists such as aspirin or thienopyridines (e.g. clopidogrel), and only supratherapeutic doses of GPIIb/IIIa antagonists may influence results. The sensitivity for coagulation factor deficiencies, including those induced by oral anticoagulation, is less pronounced as compared to clotting assays. Therefore, TEM {{is not meant to}} replace laboratory assays such as prothrombin time (PT) or factor assays. However, due to the rapid availability of differential diagnostic information, TEM has become an established method in surgical procedures where blood losses can be expected.|$|E
25|$|For E10 (10% ethanol and 90% gasoline), {{the effect}} is small (~3%) when {{compared}} to conventional gasoline, and even smaller (1–2%) when compared to oxygenated and reformulated blends. For E85 (85% ethanol), the effect becomes significant. E85 produces lower mileage than gasoline, and requires more frequent refueling. Actual performance may {{vary depending on the}} vehicle. Based on EPA tests for all 2006 E85 models, the average fuel economy for E85 vehicles resulted 25.56% lower than unleaded gasoline. The EPA-rated mileage of current United States flex-fuel vehicles should <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>when</b> making price comparisons, but E85 is a high performance fuel, with an octane rating of about 94–96, and should be compared to premium.|$|E
