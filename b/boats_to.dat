It also lowered <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> test radioactivity levels in the lagoon. B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown through the clouds, and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.|$|E

5|$|After {{the passage}} of Typhoon Mamie, more than 800,000civilians and 9,000 {{soldiers}} were organized {{in order to protect}} reservoirs from flooding. By August28, 150,000civilians and 10,000soldiers were fighting against flooding along the Liao River on a daily basis. Additionally, local military forces were called in to assist relief workers. The government organized buses and <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> carry flood victims. Some schools were used as shelter while restaurants and hospitals sent food and medicine.|$|E
5|$|After {{these steps}} {{alleviated}} their most urgent needs, the Austro-Hungarian Navy selected the German Type UB II design for its newest submarines in mid 1915. The Germans {{were reluctant to}} allocate any of their wartime resources to Austro-Hungarian construction, but were willing to sell plans {{for up to six}} of the UB II <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> be constructed under license in Austria-Hungary. The Navy agreed to the proposal and purchased the plans from AG Weser of Bremen.|$|E
5|$|At the Swansea end, Tennant built a sea-lock, so that boats {{could enter}} Fabian Bay, and named the area Port Tennant. His {{terminus}} was destroyed when the Prince of Wales Dock was {{constructed by the}} Swansea Harbour Trust in 1881. It occupied all of the area which had been Fabian Bay, and so a lock was constructed to enable <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> reach tidal water by passing through the dock, and a wharf for the canal was constructed at {{the eastern end of}} the dock. Tennant's wharf was again destroyed in 1898, when the dock was extended. Wharfage was provided for the canal along the entire southern side of the extension, but no lock was built to allow canal <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> enter the dock, even though the Act of Parliament made provision for one. A new branch of the canal was built in 1909, which included a lock into the newly constructed Kings Dock, where a lay-by berth was provided on its north side.|$|E

5|$|Austria-Hungary's U-boat fleet {{was largely}} {{obsolete}} at {{the outbreak of}} World War I, and over {{the first two years}} of the war the Austro-Hungarian Navy focused its efforts on building a U-boat fleet for local defense within the Adriatic. With <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> fill that need either under construction or purchased from Germany, efforts were focused on building ocean-going submarines for operation in the wider Mediterranean, outside the Adriatic.|$|E
5|$|General Lee {{responded to}} the British landing with several actions. He began {{reinforcing}} positions on the mainland in case the British were intending to launch an attack directly on Charleston. He also attempted to build a bridge of <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> provide an avenue of retreat for the fort's garrison, but this failed because there were not enough <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> bridge the roughly one mile (1.6km) channel separating the island from Charleston; the unwillingness of Moultrie and Rutledge to support the effort may also have played a role. The Americans also constructed an entrenchment at {{the northern end of}} Sullivan's Island, which was manned by more than 750 men and three small cannons, and began to fortify a guard post at Haddrell's Point on the mainland opposite Fort Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Grand Teton National Park started {{requiring}} all <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> display an Aquatic Invasive Species decal {{issued by}} the Wyoming Game and Fish Department or a Yellowstone National Park boat permit.

5|$|Neither {{of these}} routes was {{suitable}} for heavy freight. Lighter cargoes were carried in York <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> Hudson Bay or in canoes {{on the border}} route. Both routes required navigation of large and hazardous lakes, shallow and rapid-strewn rivers, and swampy creeks and bogs, connected by numerous portages where both cargo and watercraft had to be carried on men's backs.|$|E
5|$|On October1, a {{day before}} the {{hurricane}} moved ashore, the U.S. Weather Bureau issued northeast storm signals from Key West, Florida to Norfolk, Virginia. Similar warnings were issued in the hours preceding the hurricane moving ashore.

5|$|A {{few days}} after Babs struck the Philippines, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared four provinces as a state of calamity and ordered the release of ₱200million (PHP) in emergency funds. Estrada later released an additional ₱50million (PHP) specifically for Catanduanes, as well as ₱10,000 sent {{to the family of}} each storm fatality. The Philippine Navy sent rubber <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> Bato, Catanduanes to help with relief there. The president ordered agencies to work together to respond to the disaster and for his Trade Secretary to watch for price gouging. However, food prices tripled following Babs and Zeb, especially after roads were blocked from agriculture areas, and ferries from unaffected areas were unable to travel due to the storm.|$|E
5|$|A weak trough {{existed in}} the eastern Gulf of Mexico on September29. A {{circulation}} developed within the storm, becoming a tropical depression on October1.

Officials advised small <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> remain at port along the Louisiana coast due to the storm. On October3, Tropical Storm How turned toward the southwest as it began weakening, {{and the next day}} it moved ashore near La Pesca, Tamaulipas as a tropical depression. About six hours after making landfall, How dissipated over the Sierra Madre Oriental in northeastern Mexico. How was the only named storm in the season not to attain hurricane status.|$|E
