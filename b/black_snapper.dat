5000|$|The black {{rockfish}} (Sebastes melanops, {{also known}} variously {{as the black}} seaperch, black bass, black rock cod, sea bass, <b>black</b> <b>snapper,</b> and Pacific Ocean perch) is a rockfish of the genus Sebastes. It is sometimes misidentified as the [...] "red snapper." ...|$|E
5000|$|The <b>black</b> {{and white}} <b>snapper</b> can reach a maximum length of 75 cm, though most do not exceed 35 cm. [...] Its fins and eyes {{are black and}} its body varies in color from light grey to black {{depending}} on age. Juveniles are typically striped, changing in complete black when adult. The <b>black</b> and white <b>snapper</b> is solitary when juvenile, but forms large schools as adults. They feed on crustaceans and small fishes. [...] It is sometimes confused with its congener, the midnight snapper, M. macularis.|$|R

50|$|The {{mangrove}} snapper can {{be confused}} with the Cubera snapper or <b>black</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus cyanopterus. Mangrove snapper are typically much smaller than Cubera, but when they are of similar size, the two species can only be distinguished by examining the tooth patch on the inside roof of the mouth. Many specimens caught in Florida, specifically Punta Gorda, are actually misidentified dogtooth or dog snapper, Lutjanus jocu. The best way to distinguish between the two species is dog snapper has a lighter triangle of color with a blue band under the eye and large, sharp fangs in the front (canines), hence its common name. These fangs can deliver a painful bite, even in a small fish. The mangrove snapper feeds mostly on small fishes and crustaceans. It was also observed as systematically waiting under maternal colony of Buffy flower bat for falling bats near the entrances of Lucayan cavern, Bahamas.|$|E

40|$|The DNA “barcode”, {{the partial}} {{sequence}} of the mitochondrial gene cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI), was assessed for species identification within the genus Macolor. The Midnight Snapper, Macolor macularis Fowler 1931, is compared with its only congener, the <b>Black</b> and White <b>Snapper,</b> Macolor niger (Forsskål 1775), both collected from the south-west coast of India. The examination of fresh specimens of the two species showed diagnostic anatomical and coloration differences and the DNA barcoding showed a genetic divergence of 3. 51 % between the species. We provide a description and illustrations of DNA-barcoded specimens, assess the reliability of some key marking characters for the two species, and document the DNA barcodes for Indian specimen...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to quantitatively determine the fatty acid contents of 20 species of marine fish and four species of shellfish from Straits of Malacca. Most samples contained fairly high amounts of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), especially alpha-linolenic acid (ALA, C 18 : 3 n 3), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, C 20 : 5 n 3), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, C 22 : 6 n 3). Longtail shad, yellowstripe scad, and moonfish contained significantly higher (P< 0. 05) amounts of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), respectively. Meanwhile, fringescale sardinella, malabar red <b>snapper,</b> <b>black</b> pomfret, Japanese threadfin bream, giant seaperch, and sixbar grouper showed considerably high content (537. 2 – 944. 1 [*]mg/ 100 g wet sample) of desirable omega- 3 fatty acids. The polyunsaturated-fatty-acids/saturated-fatty-acids (P/S) ratios for most samples were higher than that of Menhaden oil (P/S= 0. 58), a recommended PUFA supplement which may help to lower blood pressure. Yellowstripe scad (highest DHA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 6. 4, P/S= 1. 7), moonfish (highest ALA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 1. 9, P/S= 1. 0), and longtail shad (highest EPA, ω- 3 /ω- 6 = 0. 8, P/S= 0. 4) were the samples with an outstandingly desirable overall composition of fatty acids. Overall, the marine fish and shellfish from the area contained good composition of fatty acids which offer health benefits and may be used for nutraceutical purposes in the future...|$|R
40|$|Utilization {{of fishing}} area in Banten Bay by various {{activities}} may cause multi sectors conflicts related to {{management of the}} bay. The integrated zone system in that area has not been established yet; therefore it is needed to be studied. The objectives {{of this study were}} to 1) determine fishing season and fishing ground; 2) determine indicators and criteria of fishing zone; 3) establish fishing zone. The study was conducted in four fish landing centers which are located in Karangantu, Terate, Wadas, and Kepuh from January to April 2010. Data were collected by surveying analyzed using the fishing season index analysis, relationship analysis between sea surface temperature, chlorophyll-a and fish abundance, and GIS analysis. Based on the results, it were revealed that 1) peak fishing season of pelagic fish was from November to January and demersal fish was from November to December; 2) the catches from fishing grounds surrounding Panjang island were anchovies, trevallies, squids, Indian mackerels, pony fishes, Fringescale sardinella; surrounding Pamujan besar island were threadfin bream, shrimps; and surrounding Tunda island were eastern little tuna, narrow barred king mackerels, <b>black</b> pomfret, red <b>snapper,</b> great trevally, scads, mullets, squids; 3) development indicators of fishing zone were (i) feasibility of fishing ground, (ii) compatibility of fishing gears with fishing grounds, (iii) possibility of conflicts, (iv) infrastructure, (v) carrying capacity of environment; 4) Banten bay water was divided into three fishing zones, they were (i) passive zone, (ii) passive and outboard motor zone, (iii) active and inboard motor zone...|$|R
40|$|Three 2 -factor {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of background colour and synthetic carotenoids on the skin colour of Australian snapper Pagrus auratus. Initially, we evaluated the effects on skin colour of supplementing diets for 50 days with 60 mg kg − 1 of either astaxanthin (LP; Lucantin ® Pink), canthaxanthin (LR; Lucantin ® Red), apocarotenoic acid ethyl ester (LY; Lucantin ® Yellow), selected combinations of the above or no carotenoids and holding snapper (mean weight= 88 g) in either white or black cages. In a second experiment, all snapper (mean weight= 142 g) from Experiment 1 were transferred from black to white, or white to white cages to measure the short-term effects of cage colour on skin L*, a* and b* colour values. Skin colour was measured after 7 and 14 days, and total carotenoid concentrations were determined after 14 days. Cage colour was the dominant factor affecting the skin lightness of snapper with fish from white cages much lighter than fish from black cages. Diets containing astaxanthin conferred greatest skin pigmentation and there were no differences in redness (a*) and yellowness (b*) values between snapper fed 30 or 60 mg astaxanthin kg − 1. Snapper fed astaxanthin in white cages displayed greater skin yellowness than those in <b>black</b> cages. Transferring <b>snapper</b> from <b>black</b> to white cages increased skin lightness but was not as effective as growing snapper in white cages for the entire duration. Snapper fed astaxanthin diets and transferred from black to white cages were less yellow than those transferred from white to white cages despite the improvement in skin lightness (L*), and the total carotenoid concentration of the skin of fish fed astaxanthin diets was lower in white cages. Diets containing canthaxanthin led to a low level of deposition in the skin while apocarotenoic acid ethyl ester did not alter total skin carotenoid content or skin colour values in snapper. In a third experiment, we examined the effects of dietary astaxanthin (diets had 60 mg astaxanthin kg − 1 or no added carotenoids) and cage colour (black, white, red or blue) on skin colour of snapper (mean weight= 88 g) after 50 days. Snapper fed the astaxanthin diet were more yellow when held in red or white cages compared with fish held in black or blue cages despite similar feed intake and growth. The skin lightness (L* values) was correlated with cage L * values, with the lightest fish obtained from white cages. The results of this study suggest that snapper should be fed 30 mg astaxanthin kg − 1 in white cages for 50 days to increase lightness and the red colouration prized in Australian markets. <br /...|$|R
