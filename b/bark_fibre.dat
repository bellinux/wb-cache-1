40|$|Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) is {{a highly}} {{productive}} crop that is cultivated worldwide for its fibre content which {{may be used to}} produce various commodities. The kenaf crop was commercially cultivated in South Africa in the 1950 ’s, but production was discontinued from the 1960 ’s up to the mid 2000 ’s. Production commenced again and kenaf emreged as a “new” fibre crop with the first kenaf processing factory in the country going into production in 2006 in KwaZulu-Natal. Due to the importance of kenaf in manufacturing of various commodities, there was a need to investigate the agronomic practices thereof to ensure sustainable yield. Therefore a two year study (2008 / 09 and 2009 / 10 summers) was conducted in Pretoria to investigate the influence of nitrogen, plant population, row spacing and water treatments on kenaf growth, yield, chemical quality and microscopic analysis of the fibre. In total, four field trials were conducted at the Hatfield Experimental Farm of the University of Pretoria. In 2008 / 09 a trial was conducted to investigate effects of plant population (200, 000; 300, 000 and 400, 000 plants ha- 1), nitrogen level (0, 50, 100 and 150 kg ha- 1) and row spacing (0. 17, 0. 34 and 0. 50 m) under rainfed conditions. Sampling for growth parameters were done at 85, 113 and 126 days after planting (DAP). The biomass and chemical analysis of <b>bark</b> <b>fibre</b> were conducted only at or after the final harvest, at 126 DAP. In general, no clear effect of different treatment was observed on either parameter studied. During 2009 / 10 three experiments were conducted. The first two had the same nitrogen levels as in the previous season, but were grown either under rainfed or irrigated conditions. The nitrogen was applied as two dressings of 0 and 50 kg ha- 1 at planting and 0, 50 and 100 kg ha- 1 at thinning (35 DAP). The third experiment investigated combinations of plant population (main plots) and row spacing (sub plots) under rainfed conditions. Due to increasing stem yield with increasing plant population during 2008 / 09, the lowest population of 200, 000 plants ha- 1 was left out and 500, 000 and 600, 000 plants ha- 1 were added. The same three row spacings as in 2008 / 09 were used. Nitrogen was applied at 150 kg ha- 1, with 50 kg ha- 1 at planting and 100 kg ha- 1 at thinning. Growth and biomass parameters, water use efficiency (WUE) (nitrogen trial only) were subsequently measured up {{to the end of the}} growth cycle. The chemical characteristics of <b>bark</b> <b>fibre</b> and nutrient removal (nitrogen trial only), nutrient use efficiency as well as the nitrogen contents of leaves and stems were determined only once at final harvest. The number of fibre rings and fibre bundles were assessed only once during the growth cycle. Growth and biomass parameters, WUE and both nutrient removal and nutrient use efficiency generally tended to increase with increase in nitrogen level under both rainfed and irrigated conditions. On the other hand, increasing plant population tended to result in a decrease in all growth parameters, while it increased biomass yield per hectare. Finally, the effect of row spacing was inconsistent for the same parameter from one sampling to another one, and from one parameter to another. The chemical characteristics of <b>bark</b> <b>fibre</b> showed inconsistent responses to all agronomic practices. The number of fibre rings and fibre bundles increased with increasing nitrogen level, decreased as plant population increased, but did not show clear trends with regard to row spacing. In general the plants grown under irrigated conditions performed better than those grown under rainfed conditions. The results of this study revealed that under the environmental conditions of Pretoria, nitrogen levels above 100 kg ha- 1 applied in two dressings should result in best plant performance, but most benefit could be obtained under irrigated conditions. A plant population of 500, 000 plants ha- 1 or higher and row spacing wider than 0. 34 m proved to be most suitable for both growth and biomass parameters.

40|$|The modern {{concept of}} “biorefinery” is dominantly based on {{chemical}} pulp mills {{to create more}} value than cellulose pulp fibres, and energy from the dissolved lignins and hemicelluloses. This concept {{is characterized by the}} conversion of biomass into various bio-based products. It includes thermochemical processes such as gasification and fast pyrolysis. In thermo-mechanical pulp (TMP) mills, the feedstock available to the gasification-based biorefinery is significant, including logging residues, <b>bark,</b> <b>fibre</b> material rejects, bio-sludges and other available fuels such as peat, recycled wood and paper products. On the other hand, mechanical pulping processes consume a great amount of electricity, which may account for up to 40 % of the total pulp production cost. The huge amount of purchased electricity can be compensated for by self-production of electricity from gasification, or the involved cost can be compensated for by extra revenue from bio-transport fuel production. This work is to study co-production of bio-automotive fuels, bio-power, and steam via gasification of the waste biomass streams {{in the context of the}} mechanical pulp industry. Ethanol and substitute natural gas (SNG) are chosen to be the bio-transport fuels in the study. The production processes of biomass-to-ethanol, SNG, together with heat and power, are simulated with Aspen Plus. Based on the model, the techno-economic analysis is made to evaluate the profitability of bio-transport fuel production when the process is integrated into a TMP mill. The mathematical modelling starts from biomass gasification. Dual fluidized bed gasifier (DFBG) is chosen for syngas production. From the model, the yield and composition of the syngas and the contents of tar and char can be calculated. The model has been evaluated against the experimental results measured on a 150 KWth Mid Sweden University (MIUN) DFBG. As a reasonable result, the tar content in the syngas decreases with the gasification temperature and the steam to biomass (S/B) ratio. The biomass moisture content is a key parameter for a DFBG to be operated and maintained at a high gasification temperature. The model suggests that it is difficult to keep the gasification temperature above 850 ℃ when the biomass moisture content is higher than 15. 0 wt. %. Thus, a certain amount of biomass or product gas needs to be added in the combustor to provide sufficient heat for biomass devolatilization and steam reforming. For ethanol production, a stand-alone thermo-chemical process is designed and simulated. The techno-economic assessment is made in terms of ethanol yield, synthesis selectivity, carbon and CO conversion efficiencies, and ethanol production cost. The calculated results show that major contributions to the production cost are from biomass feedstock and syngas cleaning. A biomass-to-ethanol plant should be built over 200 MW. In TMP mills, wood and biomass residues are commonly utilized for electricity and steam production through an associated CHP plant. This CHP plant is here designed to be replaced by a biomass-integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) plant or a biomass-to-SNG (BtSNG) plant including an associated heat & power centre. Implementing BIGCC/BtSNG in a mechanical pulp production line might improve the profitability of a TMP mill and also help to commercialize the BIGCC/BtSNG technologies by taking into account of some key issues such as, biomass availability, heat utilization etc [...] In this work, the mathematical models of TMP+BIGCC and TMP+BtSNG are respectively built up to study three cases: 1) scaling of the TMP+BtSNG mill (or adding more forest biomass logging residues in the gasifier for TMP+BIGCC); 2) adding the reject fibres in the gasifier; 3) decreasing the TMP SEC by up to 50 %. The profitability from the TMP+BtSNG mill is analyzed in comparison with the TMP+BIGCC mill. As a major conclusion, the scale of the TMP+BIGCC/BtSNG mill, the prices of electricity and SNG are three strong factors for the implementation of BIGCC/BtSNG in a TMP mill. A BtSNG plant associated to a TMP mill should be built in a scale above 100 MW in biomass thermal input. Comparing to the case of TMP+BIGCC, the NR and IRR of TMP+BtSNG are much lower.

This work is to study co-production of bio-automotive fuels, biopower, and steam via gasification {{in the context of the}} mechanical pulp industry.   Biomass gasification with steam in a dual-fluidized bed gasifier (DFBG) was simulated with ASPEN Plus. From the model, the yield and composition of the syngas and the contents of tar and char can be calculated. The model has been evaluated against the experimental results measured on a 150 KWth Mid Sweden University (MIUN) DFBG. The model predicts that the content of char transferred from the gasifier to the combustor decreases from 22. 5 wt. % of the dry and ash-free biomass at gasification temperature 750 ℃ to 11. 5 wt. % at 950 ℃, but is insensitive to the mass ratio of steam to biomass (S/B). The H 2 concentration is higher than that of CO under normal DFBG operating conditions, but they will change positions when the gasification temperature is too high above about 950 ℃, or the S/B ratio is too far below about 0. 15. The biomass moisture content is a key parameter for a DFBG to be operated and maintained at a high gasification temperature. The model suggests that it is difficult to keep the gasification temperature above 850 ℃ when the biomass moisture content is higher than 15. 0 wt. %. Thus, a certain amount of biomass needs to be added in the combustor to provide sufficient heat for biomass devolatilization and steam reforming. Tar content in the syngas can also be predicted from the model, which shows a decreasing trend of the tar with the gasification temperature and the S/B ratio. The tar content in the syngas decreases significantly with gasification residence time which is a key parameter.   Mechanical pulping processes, as Thermomechanical pulp (TMP), Groundwood (SGW and PGW), and Chemithermomechanical pulp (CTMP) processes have very high wood-to-pulp yields. Producing pulp products by means of these processes is a prerequisite for the production of printing paper and paperboard products due especially to their important functional properties such as printability and stiffness. However, mechanical pulping processes consume a great amount of electricity, which may account for up to 40 % of the total pulp production cost. In mechanical pulping mills, wood (biomass) residues are commonly utilized for electricity production through an associated combined heat and power (CHP) plant. This techno-economic evaluation deals with the possibility of utilizing a biomass integrated gasification combined cycle (BIGCC) plant in place of the CHP plant. Integration of a BIGCC plant into a mechanical pulp production line might greatly improve the overall energy efficiency and cost-effectiveness, especially when the flow of biomass (such as branches and tree tops) from the forest is increased. When the fibre material that negatively affects pulp properties is utilized as a bioenergy resource, the overall efficiency of the system is further improved. A TMP+BIGCC mathematic model is developed based on ASPEN Plus. By means of this model, three cases are studied:   1) adding more forest biomass logging residues in the gasifier, 2) adding a reject fraction of low quality pulp fibers to the gasifier, and 3) decreasing the TMP-specific electricity consumption (SEC) by up to 50 %.   For the TMP+BIGCC mill, the energy supply and consumption are analyzed in comparison with a TMP+CHP mill. The production profit and the internal rate of return (IRR) are calculated. The results quantify the economic benefit from the TMP+BIGCC mill.   Bio-ethanol has received considerable attention as a basic chemical and fuel additive. It is currently produced from sugar/starch materials, but can also be produced from lignocellulosic biomass via a hydrolysis [...] fermentation or thermo-chemical route. In terms of the thermo-chemical route, a few pilot plants ranging from 0. 3 to 67 MW have been built and operated for alcohols synthesis. However, commercial success has not been achieved. In order to realize cost-competitive commercial ethanol production from lignocellulosic biomass through a thermo-chemical pathway, a techno-economic analysis needs to be done.   In this work, a thermo-chemical process is designed, simulated, and optimized mainly with ASPEN Plus. The techno-economic assessment is made in terms of ethanol yield, synthesis selectivity, carbon and CO conversion efficiencies, and ethanol production cost.   Calculated results show that major contributions to the production cost are from biomass feedstock and syngas cleaning. A biomass-to-ethanol plant should be built at around 200 MW. Cost-competitive ethanol production can be realized with efficient equipments, optimized operation, cost-effective syngas cleaning technology, inexpensive raw material with low pretreatment cost, high-performance catalysts, off-gas and methanol recycling, optimal systematic configuration and heat integration, and a high-value byproduct...|$|E

Nest building and incubation of the second brood may occur while the fledged young of the first brood are still being fed. Young males may begin breeding two months after fledging. The nests of the New Zealand fantail are occasionally parasitised by the two species of cuckoo in New Zealand.|$|R
50|$|The Fernando Pó batis is {{restless and}} shy, highly {{arboreal}} and forages within {{the canopy of}} tall trees. It forages for insects by gleaning foliage, by flycatching or by picking prey off leaves while briefly hovering. Large insects with hard exoskeletons are rubbed and hit against a branch before being dismembered. It will join other species in mixed foraging flocks. Little {{is known about the}} breeding biology but fledged juveniles have been seen in October. The nest is built in the outer fork of a branch by both birds in the pair, using <b>bark</b> strips and <b>fibres.</b>|$|R
40|$|Dirt {{counting}} {{and dirt}} particle characterisation of pulp samples {{is an important}} part of quality control in pulp and paper production. The need for an automatic image analysis system to consider dirt particle characterisation in various pulp samples is also very critical. However, existent image analysis systems utilise a single threshold to segment the dirt particles in different pulp samples. This limits their precision. Based on evidence, designing an automatic image analysis system that could overcome this deficiency is very useful. In this study, the developed Niblack thresholding method is proposed. The method defines the threshold based on the number of segmented particles. In addition, the Kittler thresholding is utilised. Both of these thresholding methods can determine the dirt count of the different pulp samples accurately as compared to visual inspection and the Digital Optical Measuring and Analysis System (DOMAS). In addition, the minimum resolution needed for acquiring a scanner image is defined. By considering the variation in dirt particle features, the curl shows acceptable difference to discriminate the <b>bark</b> and the <b>fibre</b> bundles in different pulp samples. Three classifiers, called k-Nearest Neighbour, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-layer Perceptron are utilised to categorize the dirt particles. Linear Discriminant Analysis and Multi-layer Perceptron are the most accurate in classifying the segmented dirt particles by the Kittler thresholding with morphological processing. The result shows that the dirt particles are successfully categorized for <b>bark</b> and for <b>fibre</b> bundles...|$|R
6000|$|After a five hours' ride {{we reached}} Cavúa, the half-way house, where breakfast {{had been sent}} on; the habitations are wretched thatches, crowded with pigs and mosquitoes. Clearings had all ended, and the red land formed broken waves of poor soil, almost nude of {{vegetation}} at this mid-winter of the tropics, except thickets of [...] "milk plant" [...] and forests of quadrangular cactus; the latter are quaint as the dragon-tree, some twenty feet tall and mostly sun-scorched to touchwood. The baobab (adansonia) is apparently of two kinds, the [...] "Imbundeiro," [...] hung with long- stringed calabashes, which forms swarming-places for bees; and the [...] "Aliconda" [...] (Nkondo), whose gourd is almost sessile, and whose <b>bark</b> supplies <b>fibre</b> for cloth and ropes. The haskúl or big-aloe of Somali-land was not absent, and, amongst other wild fruits, I saw scattered over the ground the husks of a strychnine, like the east African species. Deer, hares, and partridges are spoken of in these solitudes, but they must be uncommonly hard to find at such a season.|$|R
500|$|There are few {{scientific}} {{reports on}} the breeding behaviour of the red-headed myzomela, and little detail {{is available on the}} breeding season. A study of populations in the western Kimberley reported that the birds hold territories through much of the dry season and then disperse. The nest is built in the foliage of the mangroves, suspended by a rim from a small horizontal fork about [...] above the ground or water. The nest is small and cup-shaped, and built from small pieces of <b>bark,</b> leaves, plant <b>fibre</b> and sometimes seaweed, bound together with spider web and lined with finer material. It is, on average, [...] in diameter and [...] deep.|$|R
50|$|Breeding season {{can extend}} from June to March, {{with two or}} more broods laid in a season. The nest is a large {{structure}} of long pieces of dried grasses and leaves, sticks, palm <b>fibre,</b> <b>bark,</b> and ferns and feathers for lining. Pear-shaped, it hangs above the ground or water, suspended from a vine or branch. It may be mistaken for flood debris and is often constructed near it. A clutch {{of two or three}} tapered oval 26 x 18 mm eggs is laid; they vary from brownish-purple to pale brownish-white with darker spots or blotches. There is a cap of darker colour at the large end of the eggs.|$|R
