5|$|Race {{director}} Angelo Zomegnan {{commented that}} the route was designed to <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> that of the extremely climbing-intensive 2006 Giro. The Giro's twenty-one stages were divided into the following classifications: three time trials (one team and two individual), eleven flat or undulating stages (officially there was no distinction made between flat and undulating), four intermediate stages, and three mountain stages. The race began with a team time trial {{on the island of}} Sardinia. This was followed by two flat stages and an unusually early rest day to transfer from Sardinia to Italy's mainland. The riders transferred by plane while the Giro caravan, race officials and team cars made the trip by boat. The final stage, as was tradition, was a flat, mostly ceremonial road stage to Milan, finishing with ten circuits on the Corso Venezia of the Via Montenapoleone.|$|E
5|$|Seth MacFarlane voices {{three of}} the show's main characters: Peter Griffin, Brian Griffin, and Stewie Griffin. Since MacFarlane had a strong vision for these characters, he chose to voice them himself, believing it would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> {{for someone else to}} attempt it. MacFarlane drew {{inspiration}} for the voice of Peter from a security guard he overheard talking while attending the Rhode Island School of Design. Stewie's voice was based on the voice of English actor Rex Harrison, especially his performance in the 1964 musical drama film My Fair Lady. MacFarlane uses his regular speaking voice when playing Brian. MacFarlane also provides the voices for various other recurring and one-time-only characters, most prominently those of the Griffins' neighbor Glenn Quagmire, news anchor Tom Tucker, and Lois' father, Carter Pewterschmidt.|$|E

25|$|The {{supremum}} axiom of the reals {{refers to}} subsets of the reals {{and is therefore}} a second-order logical statement. It {{is not possible to}} characterize the reals with first-order logic alone: the Löwenheim–Skolem theorem implies that there exists a countable dense subset of the real numbers satisfying exactly the same sentences in first-order logic as the real numbers themselves. The set of hyperreal numbers satisfies the same first order sentences as R. Ordered fields that satisfy the same first-order sentences as R are called nonstandard models of R. This is what makes nonstandard analysis work; by proving a first-order statement in some nonstandard model (which may <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> proving it in R), we know that the same statement must also be true of R.|$|E

[...] The New York Times referred to post-state Mogadishu as [...] "the ultimate example of deregulation," [...] noting that [...] "utsy entrepreneurs, including some women, opened their own hospitals, schools… telephone companies, power plants and ports.".|$|E
500|$|Initially, Thatgamecompany {{consisted}} of Chen, Santiago, Nick Clark, who had collaborated with Chen on Flow, and John Edwards. Santiago {{was the president}} of the company and the producer for its games, Clark was the designer, and Edwards was the lead engineer. Although Chen cofounded the company, he initially worked at Maxis on the game Spore. The company considered adapting Cloud as their first product for Sony, but instead decided on Flow, as it was [...] "more fleshed-out as a design". They felt that it would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> Cloud to develop while they built the company; no members of the team had experience with managing a business or with creating a commercial game. Several contract workers assisted Thatgamecompany with Flows development, including Austin Wintory, the game's composer.|$|E

[...] Stoff, a producer, had met Cleese a few times beforehand and had noted his intellect. The actor was surprised the filmmakers were interested in him, and decided playing a dramatic role would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> to play a comedic one at his age. He was often reminded to speed up his dialogue so that Reeves would not appear in synchronity with normal human speech patterns. Cleese said he is not interested in extraterrestrial life because he often philosophizes about the purpose of life and why humans are distracted by trivial matters. Cleese spoke about portraying abilities outside his own experience in the scene in which Klaatu corrects a formula Barnhardt has written on a blackboard: [...] "The trouble is, I {{had to be able to}} write the equation, because Barnhardt has been working on it for 60 years. I learned to carefully copy things down that mean nothing to me at all. In A Fish Called Wanda, I spoke a lot of Russian without having any idea what it means." ...|$|E

500|$|Both musicians {{continued}} {{to work on their}} own projects during the composition of Everything ThatHappens WillHappen Today. Byrne [...] of BigLove and completed his collaborations with Fatboy Slim on the album and musical HereLiesLove and the single [...] "ToeJam". Eno produced Coldplay's VivalaVida or DeathandAllHisFriends and U2's NoLineontheHorizon. Byrne and Eno discussed the former's collaboration with FatboySlim and ChrisMartin of Coldplay wrote lyrics to the instrumental track for [...] "OneFineDay", but acquiesced when he heard Byrne's version (the band would also adapt another one of Eno's instrumental compositions that Byrne did not finish into a track on VivalaVida). Once Byrne's version of [...] "OneFineDay" [...] was finished, the two began in earnest writing the rest of the tracks. Byrne initially had a long delay in writing material, but as the project progressed, he got to working several hours a day on the album and put his collaboration with FatboySlim on hold to finish the songs {{in the early part of}} 2008. Since the two did not work together face-to-face as they had in the past, it was harder for them to complete material quickly, and they had to rush to complete two of the tracks were finished at the end of the sessions. He later described the process as easy once details were sort out and summed up this method as [...] "purejoy" [...] and declared writing collaboratively to <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> writing solo. He even credited the time between their last collaboration and the transatlantic distance as a strength, since it allowed the two to keep their own schedules. Eno agreed, as it gave him time to focus on a small piece of music without holding up Byrne's progress. Byrne later used a similar approach through 2010 and 2011 in collaborations with St.Vincent (Love This Giant) and WillOldham (the soundtrack to This Must Be the Place).|$|E

[...] He moved on to 16th Avenue Records, where Pride bounced back with the number-five hit, [...] "Shouldn't it <b>be</b> <b>Easier</b> <b>Than</b> This".

2500|$|High-stakes testing {{creates more}} {{incentive}} for cheating.

Navratilova said that she accepted because she believed she and Pam had no weaknesses when playing doubles, and {{that they were going to}} 'do a Billie' and win, especially given Riggs' age. The match took place at The Atlantic City Convention Hall in Atlantic City, New Jersey. [...] Riggs' health had deteriorated somewhat from his last outing as he was now deaf and wore glasses. Moreover, because Riggs was a finesse player and not a power player, the women expected that defeating him would <b>be</b> <b>easier</b> <b>than</b> a retired power player.
