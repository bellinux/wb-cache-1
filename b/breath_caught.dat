60|$|The man was Eliphalet Hopper. He {{got down}} from the sill with a motion at once sheepish and stealthy. Her <b>breath</b> <b>caught,</b> and instinctively she gave back toward the door, as if to open it again.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him again, and her <b>breath</b> <b>caught.</b> While she had been speaking, he had changed. There was a fire in his eyes {{she had never seen}} before, in all the years she had known him.|$|E
6000|$|His {{smile was}} a caress. Her <b>breath</b> <b>caught,</b> she {{smiled back at}} him fearfully. Then he was gone. In the {{editorial}} office was heard the banging of his heavy old typewriter--it was an office joke, Walter's hammering of the [...] "threshing-machine." ...|$|E
6000|$|Carl looked about. Many were frowning; a few leaning sidewise {{to whisper}} to neighbors, with a perplexed head-shake that plainly meant, [...] "I don't quite get that." [...] Wet feet were shifted carefully; <b>breaths</b> <b>caught</b> quickly; hands nervously played with lower lips. The Greek {{professor}} was writing something. Carl's ex-room-mate, Plain Smith, was rigid, staring unyieldingly at the platform. Carl hated Smith's sinister stillness.|$|R
60|$|The {{conversation}} was here {{interrupted by a}} busy hum in the audience; and the auctioneer, a short, bustling, important fellow, elbowed {{his way into the}} crowd. The old woman drew in her <b>breath,</b> and <b>caught</b> instinctively at her son.|$|R
6000|$|We stood there, quite silent, {{for some}} moments. Then {{he drew a}} quick, stifled <b>breath,</b> and <b>caught</b> hold of my hands. [...] "I cannot breathe in this place," [...] he said, looking half fearfully around; [...] "the very air seems tainted with that horrible story, and its ghosts are lurking in every corner!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It needn't {{matter to}} you," [...] he said. [...] "I'm just a nobody. But I {{know you are}} {{the best and most}} {{beautiful}} thing I've ever spoken to." [...] His <b>breath</b> <b>caught</b> against something. [...] "No harm in telling you that," [...] he said.|$|E
6000|$|... "So--ho!" [...] yelled the king, and {{was about}} to order the keepers beheaded; but just then Nerle pulled out his match-box, lit one of the matches, and held {{it in front of the}} Dragon's mouth. Instantly the creature's <b>breath</b> <b>caught</b> fire; and it began to breathe flames a yard in length.|$|E
60|$|They {{both looked}} at me. Indeed, I {{should not have}} {{recognized}} my own voice. What my face betrayed, what my feelings were, I cannot say. My heart beat no faster, there was no tumult in my brain, and yet--my <b>breath</b> <b>caught</b> strangely. Something grew within me which is beyond the measure of speech, {{and so it was}} meant to be.|$|E
6000|$|So, cheered by his friends, Johnny {{scraped and}} dug vigorously till the old brick fell out, showing another behind it. Only pausing to take <b>breath,</b> he <b>caught</b> up his crutch and gave {{two or three}} hearty pokes, which soon cleared the way and let the {{sunshine}} stream through, while the wind tossed the lilacs like triumphal banners, and the jolly sparrows chirped,-- ...|$|R
60|$|He had {{forgotten}} the egg. It still lay on the veranda, and Nagaina came nearer and nearer to it, till at last, while Rikki-tikki was drawing <b>breath,</b> she <b>caught</b> it in her mouth, turned to the veranda steps, and flew like an arrow down the path, with Rikki-tikki behind her. When the cobra runs for her life, she goes like a whip-lash flicked across a horse's neck.|$|R
60|$|Bewildered by the blow, the half-intoxicated Frenchman {{fell back}} and Dave {{staggered}} to his feet, panting for <b>breath.</b> Valette had <b>caught</b> {{him by the}} throat, and the marks of his fingers were still visible.|$|R
6000|$|For awhile {{there was}} silence between us, then Leo said--"Do you remember, Horace, when we lay upon the Rocking Stone where her cloak fell upon me--" [...] as he said the words the <b>breath</b> <b>caught</b> in his throat--"how the ray of light was sent to us in farewell, and to show us a path of escape from the Place of Death? Now I think {{that it has been}} sent again in {{greeting}} to point out the path to the Place of Life where Ayesha dwells, whom we have lost awhile." ...|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} he stood {{head to foot}} icily still, without the least feeling, or thought, or stir--staring into the looking-glass. Then an inconceivable {{drumming}} beat on his ear. A warm surge, like the onset of a wave, broke in him, flooding neck, face, forehead, even his hands with colour. He caught himself up and wheeled deliberately and completely round, his eyes darting to and fro, suddenly to fix themselves in a prolonged stare, while {{he took a deep}} <b>breath,</b> <b>caught</b> back his self-possession and paused. Then he turned and once more confronted the changed strange face in the glass.|$|E
60|$|The Mountain-men laughed wheezily, for now {{the singing}} had died away. On they pushed again. But now the thorn-trees {{gathered}} yet closer together, so that the Mulgars could no longer walk in company, but had to straggle up by ones or twos as best they could. Still up and up they clambered, laying hold of the thick tufts of leaves sticky with poison to drag themselves forward. Many times they had to pause to recover their breath, and Nod turned giddy to {{look down on the}} moon-dappled forest through which they had so heavily ascended. Thus they continued, until, quite without warning, Thumb, who was leading, broke out into one loud, hard, short bark of fear, for he suddenly found himself standing beneath contorted branches on the verge of another and wider plateau of snow. He stood motionless, leaning heavily on his cudgel, the knuckles of his other hand resting in the snow, his <b>breath</b> <b>caught</b> back, and his head stooping forward between his shoulders, staring on and on between astonishment and fear.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't think so," [...] was {{the reply}} of the senator's son. But when he arose he {{drew in a}} sharp <b>breath.</b> [...] "He <b>caught</b> my left ankle and I reckon he twisted it a little." ...|$|R
60|$|Cole gasped for <b>breath.</b> He was <b>caught.</b> There {{was nothing}} he could do. More {{soldiers}} were pouring down into the gulley, surrounding him on all sides. They studied him curiously, murmuring together. Cole shook his head wearily and said nothing.|$|R
6000|$|Well did the Raturans {{know that}} shout. With <b>caught</b> <b>breath</b> and blanched faces they turned towards the {{direction}} whence it came, {{and they saw}} the madman bounding towards them with streaming locks and glaring eyes. A single look sufficed. The entire population of the village turned and fled! ...|$|R
60|$|Her <b>breath</b> <b>caught</b> sharply, but {{she tried}} to smile at him. He did not {{discover}} {{what was the matter}} until long afterward, when he recalled that evening to mind. Jethro was a man used to hotel corridors, used to sitting in an attitude that led the unsuspecting to believe he was half asleep; but no person of note could come or go whom he did not remember. He had seen the distinguished party arrive at the desk, preceded by a host of bell-boys with shawls and luggage. On the other hand, some of the distinguished party had watched the proceeding of paying off the band with no little amusement. Miss Janet Duncan had giggled audibly, her mother had smiled, while her father and Mr. Worthington had pretended to be deeply occupied with the hotel register. Somers was not there. Bob Worthington laughed heartily with the rest until his eye, travelling down the line of Jethro's progress, fell on Cynthia, and now he was striding across the floor toward them. And even in the horrible confusion of that moment Cynthia had a vagrant thought that his clothes had an enviable cut and became him remarkably.|$|E
60|$|Cissy came {{up along}} the strand with the two twins and their ball with her hat anyhow on her to one side after her run and she did look a streel tugging the two kids along with the flimsy blouse she bought only a {{fortnight}} before like a rag {{on her back and}} a bit of her petticoat hanging like a caricature. Gerty just took off her hat for a moment to settle her hair and a prettier, a daintier head of nutbrown tresses was never seen on a girl's shoulders--a radiant little vision, in sooth, almost maddening in its sweetness. You would have to travel many a long mile before you found a head of hair the like of that. She could almost see the swift answering flash of admiration in his eyes that set her tingling in every nerve. She put on her hat so that she could see from underneath the brim and swung her buckled shoe faster for her <b>breath</b> <b>caught</b> as she caught the expression in his eyes. He was eying her as a snake eyes its prey. Her woman's instinct told her that she had raised the devil in him and at the thought a burning scarlet swept from throat to brow till the lovely colour of her face became a glorious rose.|$|E
6000|$|Once more, therefore, {{the train}} of venerable and majestic fathers were seen moving through a broad pathway of the people, who drew back reverently, on either side, as the Governor and magistrates, {{the old and}} wise men, the holy ministers, and all that were eminent and renowned, {{advanced}} into the midst of them. When they were fairly in the marketplace, their presence was greeted by a shout. This--though doubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the child-like loyalty which the age awarded to its rulers--was felt to be an irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears. Each felt the impulse in himself, {{and in the same}} <b>breath,</b> <b>caught</b> it from his neighbour. Within the church, it had hardly been kept down; beneath the sky it pealed upward to the zenith. There were human beings enough, and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast, or the thunder, or the roar of the sea; even that mighty swell of many voices, blended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many. Never, from the soil of New England had gone up such a shout! Never, on New England soil had stood the man so honoured by his mortal brethren as the preacher! ...|$|E
5000|$|Gudu hara OR Ha-do-do is a {{game played}} {{throughout}} the Chakma region. Two teams stand {{on either side of}} a central line. They take turns sending a player into opposing territory to touch as many people as he or she can during the space of one breath, {{while at the same time}} saying [...] "Ha-do-do." [...] If the player runs out of <b>breath</b> or is <b>caught</b> by his or her opponents, he or she is out.|$|R
60|$|She sang free, {{with the}} flute gliding along with her. And oh, how {{beautiful}} {{it was for}} her! How beautiful it was to sing the little song in the sweetness of her own spirit. How sweet it was to move pure and unhampered at last in the music! The lovely ease and lilt of her own soul in its motion through the music! She wasn't aware of the flute. She didn't know there was anything except her own pure lovely song-drift. Her soul seemed to breathe as a butterfly breathes, as it rests on a leaf and slowly breathes its wings. For the first time! For the first time her soul drew its own deep breath. All her life, the <b>breath</b> had <b>caught</b> half-way. And now she breathed full, deep, to the deepest extent of her being.|$|R
60|$|It is {{impossible}} to conceive my astonishment at so unexpected a discourse, or the joy with which I became gradually convinced that the <b>breath</b> so fortunately <b>caught</b> by the gentleman (whom I soon recognized as my neighbor Windenough) was, in fact, the identical expiration mislaid by myself in the conversation with my wife. Time, place, and circumstances rendered it a matter beyond question. I did not at least during the long {{period in which the}} inventor of Lombardy poplars continued to favor me with his explanations.|$|R
5000|$|Journalist C. D. B. Bryan {{turned the}} Mullen family's intense {{pain in the}} wake of Michael's death into a series of {{articles}} published in three installments in The New Yorker during March 1976 and then released in book form that year as Friendly Fire. Bryan wrote of the unspoken sounds of pain, [...] "the slam of a hand hitting the table in rage, the <b>breath</b> <b>caught</b> because an onrushing memory was causing too much pain." ...|$|E
50|$|Later, {{the village}} people still make their retreat {{out of the}} jungle. While Le Due stops to catch his <b>breath</b> he is <b>caught</b> and choked to death by a Russian soldier. Ransom finds the corpse of Le Due and finds a Russian patch symbol torn from the {{soldiers}} uniform. The Russian soldiers are {{in search of the}} village people as Ransom kills them off one by one. Ransom soon discovers, however, that there are too many and that he must retreat. Radek commands the helicopter to retreat to base, but Ransom's major is able to talk the soldier into picking him up anyway. Ransom's major is able to calm Ransom so much so that Ransom volunteers to go back to take pictures of the base so that there will be proof of Russian presence in Vietnam.|$|R
60|$|Oh, I, too, had a rage, well tutored in such school. I was but eight when I showed {{my teeth}} at a {{drinking}} between {{the men of}} Brunanbuhr and the Juts who came as friends with the jarl Agard in his three long ships. I stood at Tostig Lodbrog's shoulder, holding the skull of Guthlaf that steamed and stank with the hot, spiced wine. And I waited while Tostig should complete his ravings against the North Dane men. But still he raved and still I waited, till he <b>caught</b> <b>breath</b> of fury to assail the North Dane woman. Whereat I remembered my North Dane mother, and saw my rage red in my eyes, and smote him with the skull of Guthlaf, {{so that he was}} wine-drenched, and wine-blinded, and fire-burnt. And as he reeled unseeing, smashing his great groping clutches through the air at me, I was in and short-dirked him thrice in belly, thigh and buttock, than which I could reach no higher up the mighty frame of him.|$|R
60|$|But {{just now}} she was very happy. It was so {{delightful}} to be tripping with her friends down that dark, gleaming road sprinkled with its little spruces and firs, whose balsam made all the air resinous around them. Meadows of sunset afterlight were behind the westerning hills. Before them was the shining harbour. A bell was ringing in the little church over-harbour and the lingering dream-notes died around the dim, amethystine points. The gulf beyond was still silvery blue in the afterlight. Oh, it was all glorious--the clear air with its salt tang, the balsam of the firs, the laughter of her friends. Rilla loved life--its bloom and brilliance; she loved the ripple of music, the hum of merry conversation; she wanted to walk on forever over this road of silver and shadow. It was her first party {{and she was going}} to have a splendid time. There was nothing in the world to worry about--not even freckles and over-long legs--nothing except one little haunting fear that nobody would ask her to dance. It was beautiful and satisfying just to be alive--to be fifteen--to be pretty. Rilla drew a long <b>breath</b> of rapture--and <b>caught</b> it midway rather sharply. Jem was telling some story to Faith--something that had happened in the Balkan War.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Winnifred tells Dauntless and {{the ladies}} in waiting about {{her home in}} the swamp ("The Swamps of Home") and meets the King, and they {{immediately}} like each other. Then, after spilling a purple vase filled with fresh new baby's <b>breath,</b> Winnifred is <b>caught</b> cleaning the mess by Lady Larken who mistakes her for a chambermaid. Soon Harry gets mad at Larken for her mistake and they get in a fight. Larken vows that she will run far far away where she will never see him again. The King, the Minstrel and the Jester catch Larken trying to run away, and they try to stop her but in the end decide to help her escape to [...] "Normandy". Later that night, the Queen throws a ball so Winnifred can dance the most exhausting dance in the world, [...] "The Spanish Panic". The Queen hopes that Winnifred will tire herself, but the plan fails. Winnifred is the last one standing as everyone collapses from exhaustion at the dance's climax. She asks Dauntless to try to give her a clue as to what the test might be, but he's not sure. He brings out a huge barbell that one of the princesses was asked to lift, but even he cannot lift it. Winnifred does easily and Dauntless admits that he loves her. Winnifred mentions that her nickname is Fred and Dauntless sings of his love for her as she practices numerous tasks she might have to do for the test, including singing, dancing, wrestling, acting, playing the Minstrel's lute, pantomiming and drinking herself unconscious ("Song of Love").|$|R
6000|$|Their afternoon's {{experience}} {{was something that}} Basil and Isabel could, when it was past, look upon only {{as a kind of}} vision, magnificent at times, and at other times full of indignity and pain. They seemed to have dreamed of a long horse-car pilgrimage through that squalid street by the river-side, where presently they came to a market, opening upon the view hideous vistas of carnage, and then into a wide avenue, with processions of cars like their own coming and going up and down the centre of a foolish and useless breadth, which made even the tall buildings (rising gauntly up among the older houses of one or two stories) on either hand look low, and let in the sun to bake the dust that the hot <b>breaths</b> of wind <b>caught</b> up and gent swirling into the shabby shops. Here they dreamed of the eternal demolition and construction of the city, and farther on of vacant lots full of granite boulders, clambered over by goats. In their dream they had fellow-passengers, whose sufferings made them odious and whom they were glad to leave behind when they alighted from the car, and running out of the blaze of the avenue, quenched themselves {{in the shade of the}} cross-street. A little strip of shadow lay along the row of brown-stone fronts, but there were intervals where the vacant lots cast no shadow. With great bestowal of thought they studied hopelessly how to avoid these spaces as if they had been difficult torrents or vast expanses of desert sand; they crept slowly along till they came to such a place, and dashed swiftly across it, and then, fainter than before, moved on. They seemed now and then to stand at doors, and to be told that people were out and again that they were in; and they had a sense of cool dark parlors, and the airy rustling of light-muslined ladies, of chat and of fans and ice-water, and then they came forth again; and evermore ...|$|R
