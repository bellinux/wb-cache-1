40|$|Introduction: Cutting is an {{important}} skill in team-sports, but unfortunately is also related to non-contact ACL injuries. The purpose was to examine knee kinetics and kinematics at different <b>cutting</b> <b>angles.</b> Material and methods:  13 males and 16 females performed cuts at different angles (45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °) at maximum speed. 3 D kinematics and kinetics were collected. To determine differences across <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> (45 °, 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °) and sex (female, male), a 4  ×  2 repeated measures ANOVA was conducted followed by post hoc comparisons (Bonferroni) with alpha level set at α ≤  0. 05  a priori. Results: At all <b>cutting</b> <b>angles,</b> males showed greater knee flexion angles than females (p <  0. 01). Also, where males performed all <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> with no differences {{in the amount of}} knee flexion − 42. 53 ° ±  8. 95 °, females decreased their knee flexion angle from − 40. 6 ° ±  7. 2 ° when cutting at 45 ° to − 36. 81 ° ±  9. 10 ° when cutting at 90 °, 135 ° and 180 ° (p <  0. 01). Knee flexion moment decreased for both sexes when <b>cutting</b> towards sharper <b>angles</b> (p <  0. 05). At 90 °, 135 ° and 180 °, males showed greater knee valgus moments than females. For both sexes, knee valgus moment increased towards the sharper <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> and then stabilized compared to the 45 ° <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> (p <  0. 01). Both females and males showed smaller vGRF when <b>cutting</b> to sharper <b>angles</b> (p <  0. 01). Conclusion: It can be concluded that different <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> demand different knee kinematics and kinetics. Sharper <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> place the knee more at risk. However, females and males handle this differently, which has implications for injury prevention...|$|R

Sugarcane stalks were dynanically cut by rotary cutter of fixd of a shaft (Fig 7) The cutting was experimented at six <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> {{in a range of}} 0 °to 50 °, and at five cutting speeds in a range of 17 to 21 meters per second. The shape of cut ends of the sugarcane was examined as affected by the <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> and speed. The results obtained were in the following. When sugarcane stalks were statically cut, their resistance inereased with the circumference of the stalks.

40|$|When cutting water {{saturated}} sand, as {{is done in}} dredging, {{agriculture and}} soil movement in general, the process {{is dominated by the}} phenomenon of dilatancy. Based on pore pressure calculations and the equilibrium of horizontal and vertical forces, equations can be derived to predict the cutting forces. The derivation of this model has been described extensively in previous papers by Miedema et all (1983 - 2005). In the equations derived, the denominator contains the sine of the sum of the 4 <b>angles</b> involved, the <b>cutting</b> <b>angle</b> α, the shear angle β, the angle of internal friction ϕ and the soil interface friction angle δ. So when the sum of these 4 angles approaches 180 ° the sine will become zero and the cutting forces become infinite. When the sum of these 4 angles is greater then 180 ° the sine becomes negative and so do the cutting forces. Since this does not occur in reality, nature must have chosen a different mechanism for the case where the sum of these 4 angles approaches 180 °. Hettiaratchi and Reece, (1975) found a mechanism which they called boundary wedges for dry soil. At large <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> a triangular wedge will exist in front of the blade, not moving relative to the blade. This wedge acts as a blade with a smaller blade angle. In fact, this reduces the sum of the 4 angles involved to a value much smaller than 180 °. The existence of a dead zone (wedge) in front of the blade when cutting at large <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> will affect the value and distribution of vacuum water pressure on the interface. He, (1998), proved experimentally that also in water saturated sand at large <b>cutting</b> <b>angles</b> a wedge will occur.
