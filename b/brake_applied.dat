The braking dynamics is analyzed by considering two versions for the braking system: 1) <b>braking</b> <b>applied</b> on the rear axle and 2) <b>braking</b> <b>applied</b> on all four wheels. The mathematical model enables us to graphically illustrate the evolution of the following parameters: braking deceleration, braking speed and the distance traveled by the tractor during braking.

5000|$|A {{combined}} {{braking system}} (CBS), also called linked braking system (LBS), is a system for linking front and rear brakes on a motorcycle or scooter. [...] In this system, the rider's action of depressing one of the brake levers applies both front and rear brakes. The amount of each <b>brake</b> <b>applied</b> may be determined by a proportional control valve.This is distinct from integrated brakes, where applying pressure to brake pedal only includes application of some front brake.|$|E

5000|$|Ghost riding, {{frequently}} {{used in the}} context of [...] "ghost riding the whip" [...] (a [...] "whip" [...] being a vehicle) or simply ghostin'''', is when a person exits their moving vehicle, and dances beside and around it. Ghost riding is also another term used for car surfing, and the term is also occasionally used to describe a moving vehicle with no occupant, such as when a car without the hand <b>brake</b> <b>applied</b> starts to roll down an incline. Ghostin'''' originated on the West Coast of the United States, primarily in California. It gets its name from the fact that while the driver is dancing beside the moving vehicle, it appears that the vehicle is being driven by an invisible driver.|$|E

50|$|Slack action {{creates a}} danger of {{accident}} as {{the length of a}} train increases. This is particularly the case when a train stops in a siding and is more or less compressed. Then the driver will release the brake while standing, while the locomotive direct <b>brake</b> <b>applied</b> and the train will stretch backwards and will possibly foul the switch/points behind the train. There have been very serious incidents with this effect. Slack action also can lead to severe longitudinal forces in a train that can result in a divided train. While accidents from slack action do occur in the operation of passenger trains, they are not of sufficient severity to cause serious injury or damage, regardless of train length. The draft gear of modern couplers is designed to reduce slack action over older technology, such as link and pin connections.|$|E
5000|$|A car {{should be}} allowed to come to a {{complete}} stop before setting the transmission into park to prevent damage. Usually, Park (P) is one of only two selections in which the car's engine can be started, the other being Neutral (N). This is typically achieved via a normally open inhibitor switch (sometimes called a [...] "neutral safety switch") wired in series with the starter motor engagement circuit, which is closed when P or N is selected, completing the circuit (when the key is turned to the start position). In many modern cars and trucks, the driver must have the foot <b>brake</b> <b>applied</b> before the transmission can be taken out of park. The Park position is omitted on buses/coaches (and some road tractors) with automatic transmission (on which a parking pawl is not practical), which must instead be placed in neutral with the air-operated parking brakes set.|$|E

5000|$|With the {{electrical}} generator (a large dynamo) for the motor permanently {{connected to the}} petrol engine, the early petrol electric controls available were a sprung return throttle pedal (with a hand operated variable latching throttle to set and adjust the idle speed), a brake pedal, a means of steering (wheel, etc) and two usually column mounted levers. One centre off lever operated a three position changeover switch to permit running in either direction, and the other lever operated a wiper across a bank of large high current wire wound resistances which affected the motor and dynamo fields, to give {{the electrical}} effect of gearing. It was (is, {{the author of this}} section has maintained and driven a 1914 TS3 model for over fifteen years as of 2015) very important to set the minimum possible idle speed, or when engaging the direction switch excess load on the system and possible unwanted movement will occur. The resistance [...] "gear" [...] lever is then set to max torque, and then the direction lever set to (say) forward. On releasing the handbrake and pressing the throttle pedal a little the vehicle will glide away smoothly. Giving more throttle and gradually altering the resistance lever will then produce higher speed, with none of the jerking and pauses in acceleration of a gearbox. To stop, the throttle pedal is released, the resistance lever is brought back to [...] "slow speed", the <b>brake</b> <b>applied</b> and as rest is achieved the forward/reverse lever moved to neutral and handbrake applied. There is however NO engine braking available as from a mechanical drive changed into a lower gear, so the system relies totally on the mechanical wheel brakes, which on early chassis applied to the rear axle only.|$|E

The most important objective in this design is to differentiate the pressure effect and braking temperature condition of different pad. Before this, student and instructor only exposed by theory and not by practical which can give more knowledge and easy to understand the principle of braking system. This apparatus also can use to compare with data from calculation theory. This project invo!ves three main parts such as structure, movement mechanism and related sensor. The main concept in this apparatus is thermocouple used to detect the temperature gain while braking process. Thermocouple attached to the pad on the same position for every pad and it will show the same error. Speed Motor Controller used for set the angular velocity of the motor in braking process. Pressure applied at brake pedal detect by Pressure Gauge and Data Logger functions as a connector to show the temperature gain at pads which detect by thermocouple in temperature versus time graph.

40|$|The Controller Area Network (CAN) is a serial,asynchronous, multi-master {{communication}} protocol invented mainly for connecting electronic control modules in automotive applications needing {{high levels of}} data integrity and data rates of up to 1 Mbit/s. In reality the field of application of CAN is not only limited to automotive applications nowadays. It is now using in fields like industrial automation, medical equipments, and home automation. The objective of this work is to implement a CAN network for some real time control system. Here the system consisting of three application nodes; Anti-Lock braking system, Adaptive Cruise Control, and seat belt module, which are crucial parts in today‟s vehicles. The hardware part of this work consists of a simple dc motor controlled electric vehicle, three MC 9 S 12 DP 256 B microcontroller modules as three nodes, and a stepper motor arrangement for controlling the speed. The CAN Network is implemented using the CAN modules available in the microcontroller as on chip peripheral. An external transceiver MC 33388 is using for each node to drive the network. The ABS and ACC algorithms are implemented using the fuzzy logic support of the microcontroller. The operation {{of the system is}} as follows: If any sudden <b>brake</b> <b>applied</b> to the brake pedal the ABS module will be activated. By monitoring the slip ratio and brake pressure applied ABS controls the vehicle speed. In the meantime it will {{send a message to the}} seat belt module to activate the system. If the ACC module switched on, it will continuously monitors any forward obstacle is there in the front line of the vehicle, and if it detects any the module will inform the ABS module to take the necessary action. In this thesis work main concern is to implement the CAN network to a more complex real time systems. The CAN network can apply to even more complex control systems by increasing its nodes. Depending on the application different CAN nodes have different CAN messaging needs. By using improved versions of CAN like, flexRay CAN, Time Triggered CAN (TTCAN), and by decentralizing the network again with sub network protocols like LIN we can achieve different application needs...|$|E
