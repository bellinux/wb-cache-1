40|$|In the past, {{tuna fishing}} in Tema was {{essentially}} {{carried out by}} <b>baitboats</b> yielding {{the majority of the}} landings in Ghana, unloading about 30 000 to 40 000 MT yearly in Tema. Fish caught by this gear was rather small, captured only on free swimming school. With the introduction of drifting fishing aggregating devices (FADs) in the mid 1990 ’s, the situation has became more complex with generalisation of <b>baitboats</b> fishing with FADs and later cooperation of <b>baitboats</b> with purse seiners. An ultimate change is the increasing practice of transhipping at sea from small purse seiners to “carriers ” which bring the frozen tuna catch to Tema. These changes seems to have altered species composition and sizes proportion of landings. The present document examines the possible consequences on the collection of biostatistics data from these fisheries. RÉSUM...|$|E
40|$|The {{commercial}} tuna fishery of the East Atlantic {{and like}} wise the Ghanaian tuna fishery {{are based on}} the harvests of Bigeye, Skipjack and Yellowfin. In Ghana, <b>baitboats</b> and purse seiners commercially harvest these species of tuna. This study analysed the CPUE for the Ghanaian tuna fishery. The analysis was made for the three species and also for the two vessel types. The effort was standardized to large purse seiner days. The results when compared to the CPUE per species for the East Atlantic revealed that the Ghanaian vessels (1980 – 2000) were in some cases up to 40 times more efficient than large purse seiners in the East Atlantic (1967 - 1980). A single species bioeconomic analysis was conducted {{for each of the three}} species using biological parameters adopted from Conrad and Adu-Asamoah (1986). This showed that present harvest levels of Skipjack and Yellowfin for the East Atlantic region were in excess of the open access equilibrium. Thus a decline in future harvest levels of Skipjack and Yellowfin is expected. Sustainable economic rents calculated for the two-vessel types revealed that, bioeconomically, <b>baitboats</b> are more profitable than purse seiners. It was observed that the FAD’s might be the main cause of changes in the species composition ratio of the tuna catches over the past decade...|$|E
40|$|During a tuna tagging program, {{conducted}} on board Dakar <b>baitboats</b> in 1999, {{two types of}} tags were used: the conventional “spaghetti ” tags and the tags used by BETYP tagging program (ICCAT) from “sport fishing ” design. Advantages and disadvantages of each type of tags are presented. Statistical analysis are based on GLM and randomization tests. Return rates, recapture’s locations, growth rates and times at liberty are compared between both tags for three tuna species (yellowfin, skipjack and bigeye). Results conclude to a lower efficiency of BETYP tags. For instance, recapture rate and time at liberty for bigeye as well as growth rate for yellowfin are significatively lower when one uses BETYP tags. However, there is no significative {{difference between the two}} types of tags for these parameters for skipjack. Finally, the implementation of BETYP tags is not well suited to intensive tropical tuna tagging programs, as it is then necessary to tag the greatest possible number of fish during a limited time period.

40|$|Relative {{abundance}} and mean size at age {{analyses were performed}} for the catches of three Atlantic Spanish fisheries, {{in search of an}} exceptionally abundant cohort in the recent history of the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna stock. Length distributions of <b>baitboat</b> fisheries, both in the Bay of Biscay and areas close to the Strait of Gibraltar as well as trap catches from the Spanish Atlantic coast were converted to age distributions using age length keys from calcified structures. Results do validate indirectly the ageing method. The 1994 cohort was clearly tracked for juveniles and young adults, 3 to 7 years old, in <b>baitboat</b> catches, and also for older specimens, 9 to 11 years old, in the trap fisheries. Based on these results, it is suggested that the juvenile and young adults fisheries {{in the western part of}} the Iberian Peninsula are interconnected between one another and with the Balearic Islands area of the western Mediterranean, as it is the nearest spawning ground described and because it is also supported by tagging and other studies.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{standardize}} catch per unit effort (CPUE) for yellowfin caught by Brazilian <b>baitboats,</b> the data reported in Task II database were analyzed during the assessment meeting for tropical tunas. Models and results gathered during that exercise {{are described in}} this document. I have used generalized linear models (GLMs) to estimate standardized CPUE. Gamma density distributions were used to model the positive catches, while binomial distributions were used to model the proportion of positive catches. Factors included in the GLMs were area, quarter and year. Two databases were analyzed, namely “complete ” and “set by set”. In the latter, fishing days are reported one by one. However, “complete ” data set includes all available data, no matter if effort and catch were summed up by trip, fleet, month or area. Standardized catch rates as calculated using both dataset showed slight increasing trends. Because data about some potentially important explanatory variables (e. g. amount of bait released) are not available those estimates are not ideal relative abundance indices.

40|$|Ghanaian {{industrial}} tuna {{fisheries data}} covering the period 2006 - 2013 were analyzed following guidelines provided during the ICCAT preparatory {{meeting for the}} 2015 assessment of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus; BET). To account for differences in fishing strategy and quality of data sources available, the fleet was split between a component of large purse seiners and a component composed of <b>baitboats</b> and purse seiners that can collaborate at sea. First, the total Task I was derived from information on landings and logbooks {{for the first and}} second fleet components, respectively. Second, the monthly proportion of catch and spatial distribution on a 5 °x 5 ° grid were derived from logbook data with some necessary assumptions when data were missing. Third, species composition of the catch was estimated from the size samples collected onboard European purse seiners from fishing sets made on fish aggregating devices based on three processing areas. Bigeye represented about 15 % in the &# 8216;offshore&# 8217; area while its percentage in the catch was about 7 - 8 % in areas closer to the shore during the same period.

40|$|Conventional “spaghetti ” tags and tags {{originally}} designed for “sport fishing ” (referred to as Betyp tags), were used during a tuna tagging program conducted on board Dakar <b>baitboats</b> in 1999. A tag-attrition {{model has been}} used to estimate type- 1 and type- 2 tag losses and the rate of instantaneous natural mortality of bigeye tuna (Thunnus obesus). The immediate mortality on bigeye due to the Betyp tags has been estimated at about 31. 1 % and the extra continuous mortality rate at 0. 30 year- 1. The instantaneous rate of natural mortality for juveniles of bigeye (average FL = 56. 6 cm) provided by this model (0. 615 year- 1 for the mean and 0. 675 year- 1 for the median) is consistent with previous estimates. In a Bayesian approach, we used the Sampling-Importance Resampling algorithm for updating Hampton’s estimate of M in light of information provided by the data analyzed in the present study. Based on the simulated posterior distribution, it appears likely that for juveniles of bigeye, M is close to 0. 62 - 0. 67 year- 1, with confidence bounds at 0. 25 - 0. 86 year- 1. In addition, potential causes affecting differences in return rates between both types of tags are analyzed. RÉSUM...|$|E
40|$|Tuna are of {{significant}} global economic importance and a prime food source. Increased levels of fishing {{have resulted in}} many stocks being under threat {{and a number of}} species are considered to be overfished. The South African tuna industry has had limited management attention from the South African fisheries management agency. A recent development has been {{an increase in the number}} of tuna caught by small vessels that target the fresh tuna market in South Africa and overseas. This has highlighted the importance of developing a holistic management plan for the sector and creating an awareness, among vessel owners, of the importance of compliance with initiatives such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). The South African tuna fishery comprises three sectors: <b>baitboat,</b> sport and longline, all of which are currently in need of acquiring more biological and fisheries data. This project was initiated to collate existing information and to collect additional information where possible. This encompassed a qualitative and quantitative assessment of the size and shape of the tuna fishing industry, which included estimates of total catch, effort, catch-per-unit-of-effort (CPUE) and stock structure (obtained through comparative estimates of age and growth), as well as socio-economic and economic information. A technique involving an examination of specific vertebrae was used to obtain age-growth information for T. albacares. These data were used to estimate von Bertalanffy (VBGF) growth parameters: F 2 1., k 0. 1, and t₀ - 0. 1 year. No significant differences in growth parameters were found in yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) from different localities around the South African coast, i. e. from the south eastern Atlantic and the south western Indian Ocean. In addition, growth did not differ between South Africa and other regions (Draganic and Pelzcarski 1984, Fonteneau 1980, Gascuel et al. 1992, LeGuen and Sakagawa 1973, Lehodey and Leroy 1999, Lessa and Duarte-Neto 2004, Shuford et al. 2007, Stequert et al. 1996, Wild 1986, Yang et al. 1969). Further substantiation of the above-mentioned observations was found by recording differences in the sizes of fish caught in the inshore (<b>baitboat</b> and sport fishery vessels) and offshore (large pelagic longline vessels) sectors of South African tuna fisheries. A significant difference between the regions — in terms of the size of fish caught inshore — was noted, with mostly-juvenile fish being caught in KwaZulu-Natal (5. 4 ± 3. 5 kg), sub-adult fish in the Eastern Cape (26. 2 ± 13. 4 kg), and adult fish in the Western Cape (42. 3 ± 14. 4 kg). Since mostly-adult fish were caught offshore by longliners, with no significant differences between regions, it is however possible th at adult fish predominantly inhabit the offshore region. Yellowfin tuna caught by the large pelagic longline fishery in the three managerial zones (A, B and C) were predominantly adult fish of similar size, namely Zone A: 38. 9 ± 6. 9 kg; Zone B: 28. 7 ± 4. 6 kg, and Zone C: 36. 0 ± 5. 1 kg. The recreational ski boat sport fishery has remained stable, in terms of participation, consisting mostly of white middle aged males in the top 25 % of household income distribution, having either permanent occupational status or being retired. Fishers within this sector are willing to incur great expense to partake in the fishery and they provide an important economic contribution to coastal towns, particularly in the Eastern Cape. The total catch (of 83 t) of yellowfin tuna by the competitive sport fishery within the Western and Eastern Cape regions was considerably lower than that of commercial tuna <b>baitboat</b> catches, which amounted to 186 t, and the large pelagic longline sector that caught t in 200. It is however likely that the competitive sport fishery's total yellowfin tuna catch (of 83 t in 2009) of the Eastern and Western Cape competitive sport fishery was considerably less than the total yellowfin tuna catches of the whole South African deep-sea sport fishery. Longfin tuna are the primary target species of South Africa‘s <b>baitboat</b> fisheries, comprising an average of 86 % of the total catch and generating ZAR 49 million in employment income in 2002. South Africa was responsible for 20 % of the total longfin tuna annual yield in 2004 in the southern Atlantic Ocean, behind Taiwan with 59 %. However, yellowfin tuna only contributes a small percentage towards total catches (8. 4 ± 8. 2 % between 1995 and 2009), generating ZAR 1. 3 million in employment income in 2002. Of the four vessel categories comprising the tuna <b>baitboat</b> fishery, ski boats had the highest yellowfin tuna CPUE in 2009 (117 ± 62 kg. vessel⁻¹. day⁻¹) and the lowest effort. The ski boats sector is the most opportunistic fishery as they are only active when either longfin or yellowfin tuna are in high abundance. At such times catches are guaranteed, so can be expected to offset expenses. In 2009 the CPUE for yellowfin tuna for 15 – 19 m vessels and freezer deckboats was 12 ± 20 kg. vessel⁻¹. day⁻¹ and 3 ± 6 kg. vessel⁻¹. day⁻¹, respectively. These vessels specifically target longfin tuna when they are in abundance. Since the start of the tuna <b>baitboat</b> fishery in 1995, there has been a substantial increase in the number of new entrants. In 2002 this sector had a fleet size of 82 vessels with a capital value of ZAR 163 million and a total employment income of ZAR 58 million, employing 2 173 fishers, of which 87 % were black African. The commercial tuna <b>baitboat</b> fleet has subsequently grown to 200 vessels and 3600 crew, with 110 active vessels fishing for a combined fleet average of 46 days per year. There are a high number of owner-operated vessels. Since 2007 the fishery's profit to cost ratio has been low due to the low abundance of tuna stocks off the coast of South Africa, which has resulted in poor catch returns, placing economic pressure on the fishery. The <b>baitboat</b> industry is a low-profit-margin fishery with a total net catch value worth ZAR 90 million in 2009 (Feike 2010). The abundance of yellowfin tuna influences profit margins, with very high profits being made when abundance and catches are high. The large pelagic longline fishery has a total allowable effort of 43 vessels of which only 30 vessels fished during 2009, when a reported 766 t of yellowfin tuna were caught, representing a total tonnage far in excess of that obtained by the combined effort of the <b>baitboat</b> and sport fishery. It is, however, assumed that considerable underreporting of catches takes place within this fishery, which means that the estimated total net catch value of ZAR 100 million could, in fact, be much higher. Such underreporting of catches is of great concern for this fishery, as is the high bycatch of Chondricthians spp. that significantly outweighs imposed regulatory limits (DEAT 2007). The present study demonstrates the current lack of comprehensive catch and effort data for the sport, <b>baitboat</b> and longline fisheries as well as the serious limitations and flaws associated with current databases. Results from the present study have drawn attention to a number of high-priority research needs, as outlined below. (1) A major lack of comprehensive catch and effort data for the sport fishery, which can be rectified by focussing on obtaining more competition data, as well as high-quality catch and effort and socio-economic information, as opposed to relying on information from non-club anglers (Gartside et al. 1999, Williams 2003, Cass-Calay 2008). Acquisition of such data is relatively inexpensive: the location of organized clubs and their frequent competition meetings provide widespread coverage along the Southern African coastline. Such data acquisition efforts have the potential to provide reliable information on spatial catch trends. (2) Validation of vessel catch return data is required for commercial fisheries and on some recent data that has emerged from studies of catch rates and trends for target species, particularly in the longline fishery. In this context it should be noted that the most recent peer-reviewed publications on this exploratory fishery were published more than a decade ago (Kroese 1999, Penny and Griffiths 1999). Additional studies need to be undertaken and journal articles published on the current stock status of South African catches of yellowfin and bigeye tuna and swordfish...|$|R

40|$|Tagging data {{obtained}} during the research program called MAC are reanalyzed for skipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis), using the von Bertalanffy-Fabens ’ growth model.

The analyses include the Francis ’ maximum likelihood estimation approaches accounting for growth variability {{as a function}} of the expected growth increment.

An alternative von Bertalanffy-Fabens ’ growth model was used in which to L∞ was substituted by this function of K. After the comparison of different error structure models, the estimates corresponding to the best fit under the AIC criteria were obtained for K = 0. 251 and, after re-introducing this value in the bioenergetic equation, L ∞ = 97. 258.

40|$|ENGLISH: Totals of 59, 547 tagged yellowfin and 90, 412 tagged {{skipjack}} {{were released}} during 1952 - 1964 throughout {{the range of}} the fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean during that period. Most of the fish were released from commercial <b>baitboats,</b> either on regular fishing trips or on chartered trips to catch fish for tagging. There we re 8, 397 yellowfin and 4, 381 skipjack returned from these releases. There appear to be two main groups of yellowfin in the eastern Pacific Ocean. There is considerable intermingling among the fish of the two groups, however. The fish of the northern group (west coast of Baja California, Gulf of California, and Revillagigedo Islands) first appear in the Revillagigedo Islands in about April, and migrate north along the Baja California coast during the spring and summer and south along that coast during the fall. Recruits to the southern group (Tres Marias Islands to northern Chile) appear at many points or continuously along most of the coast. The fish which first appear in the northern Panama Bight in April migrate rapidly northwest to Central America and Mexico and south to the Gulf of Guayaquil. There also appear to be two main groups of skipjack in the eastern Pacific Ocean. The fish of the northern group (west coast of Baja California, Gulf of California, and Revillagigedo Islands) perform about the same migration as do the yellowfin of the same area, but most of the skipjack apparently then migrate to the central Pacific Ocean during the fall and/or winter. Recruits to the southern group (Central America to northern Chile) appear mostly in or near the Panama Bight. The fish which first appear in the northern Panama Bight in April migrate rapidly northwest to Central America and south to the Gulf of Guayaquil. The proportions which migrate in these directions vary considerably from year to year, this perhaps being dependent on differences in the sea-surface temperatures. SPANISH: Durante el período de 1952 - 1964 se liberó a través de todos los límites de distribución de la pesquería en el Océano Pacífico oriental un total de 59, 547 aleta amarilla y 90, 412 barriletes marcados. La mayoria de los peces fueron liberados de barcos de carnada comerciales, o en viajes regulares de pesca o en viajes en los que se fletaron los barcos para capturar atunes y marcarlos. De estas líberaciones se recapturaron 8, 397 aleta amarilla y 4, 381 barriletes. Parece que haya dos grupos principales de aleta amarilla en el Océano Pacífico oriental. Sin embargo, existe una entremezcla considerable entre los peces de los dos grupos. Los peces del grupo septentrional (costa occidental de Baja California, Golfo de California y Islas Revillagigedo) aparecen primero en las Islas Revillagigedo alrededor de abril, y durante la primavera y el verano se desplazan al norte a lo largo de la costa de Baja California y durante el otoño al sur a lo largo de la costa. Los reclutas del grupo meridional (Islas Tres Marias hasta el norte de Chile) aparecen en muchas partes o continuamente a lo largo de la mayoría de la costa. Los peces que aparecen primero en la región septentrional del Panamá Bight en abril se desplazan rápidamente al noroeste a la América Central y México y al sur al Golfo de Guayaquil. Parece también que existen dos grupos principales de barrilete en el Océano Pacífico oriental. Los peces del gr upo septentrional (costa occidental de Baja California, Golfo de California e Islas Revillagigedo) realizan casi la misma migración que el atún aleta amarilla de la misma área, pero aparentemente la mayor parte del barrilete se desplaza luego al Océano Pacífico central durante el otoño y/o en el invierno.

40|$|The Working Group on Southern Horse Mackerel, Anchovy and Sardine (WGHANSA), met at Bilbao (Spain), 21 – 26 June 2013, {{chaired by}} Andrés Uriarte. There were 11 {{participants}} from France, Portugal and Spain (one attending on line). The main {{task was to}} assess the status and to provide short term predictions for the stocks of Anchovy in Subarea VIII and in Division IXa, for Sardine in Divisions VIIIc and IXa, and in Divisions VIIIab and subarea VII, and for horse mackerel (T. trachurus) in Division IXa and Jack Marckerel (T. pictoratus) in X (Azores). Most assessments were updated assessments according to the stock annexes, except Jack mackerel in Azores which has a biennial advice. The Anchovy in Subarea VIII was estimated to be at 56 055 t in May 2013 (within a range 36 220 – 88 925 t), well above Blim, according to the Bayesian modelling of the population. This SSB is perceived to be about 31 % below the 2012 level; Nevertheless the later has been revised upward by 19 % as compared with last year assessment. As usual two spring surveys were used as inputs for the Bayesian assessment of the population. After a strong discrepancy of their estimates in 2012, the 2013 estimates of biomass provided by the spring surveys were closer though not coincident (65 909 t the DEPM and 93 854 the acoustic). The decrease in biomass between 2012 and 2013 is related to the relative agreement of both surveys in pointing out that the percentage of age 1 in mass was less than for ages 2 and older, as this imply not a sufficient regeneration of the population in 2013 as to maintain the 2012 biomass. Catch options were provided on the basis of undetermined recruitment in 2014. As in previous years, the WG collected the available data on the fisheries of anchovy in northern areas (Subareas VI, VII and IV), although no assessment is so far required for the anchovy in those regions. Anchovy in Division IXa, demands separate analysis and advice for the western Iberian Atlantic coasts (i. e. Subdivisions IXa North, Central- North and Central-South) from the southern regions (Algarve and Gulf of Cadiz, i. e. Subdivision IXa South), due to the independent dynamics and genetic differentiation of the populations in these regions. This a data poor stock category for which trend based assessment from surveys is provided. In the western areas catches are generally low, in rare occasion exceeding a thousand tonnes (as in 1995 / 96). In 2011, after several years of almost null detections, the acoustic PELAGO+PELACUS surveys estimated a Biomass of 27, 000 t, in that area, and catches rose up to 3780 t. However in 2013, these surveys estimated a sharp reduction of biomass to rather low normal levels (around 4284 t). This confirms that the outburst episodes of biomass are not sustainable in this North-western region of IXa. In the Subdivision IXa South, where the bulk of the population is usually concentrated and supports a rather stable fishery, the 2013 biomass index from the acoustic PELAGO survey is 49 % below the median historic survey results. This estimate was supported by a Spanish recruitment survey in the autumn of 2012 which pointed out to a recruitment value below average too. However neither the fishery nor the population indexes (assessed by surveys) show any long trend for the anchovy in IXa south. Exploratory evaluations of current harvest rates in the context of Yield per recruit analysis suggest that current exploitation levels in the IXa seem sustainable. Exploration of length-based reference points also supported this view. There is no information on recruitment that will form the bulk of the catches in the following year. For the Iberian Sardine, after a gap in survey inputs in 2012, new acoustic surveys in the spring 2013 (PELAGO+PELACUS) allowed an updated analytic assessment of the population. These surveys recorded the lowest historical biomass levels, but at rather similar values as their former estimates of 2011. As such, the assessment based on the Stock Synthesis pointed to a pronounced decline of biomass since 2006 {{due to the lack of}} any strong recruitment since 2005. Current biomass of about 192 000 t in 2013, would be around historical minimum, being in 2012 around 64 % below the long-term average, while fishing mortality seems to be around the historical average, fluctuating without a clear trend. The stock is expected to decline unless a new strong year class appears. Catch options assuming another low recruitment as in recent years (2008 – 2012) were provided. The WG was assessed by the first time the Sardine in Divisions VIIIa,b,d and Subarea VII, by analysing survey trends according to the benchmark carried out in February 2013 (WKPELA). Surveys, restricted to subarea VIII (acoustic –Pelgas- and eggs – Bioman- surveys), show no neat trend in biomass indexes since 2000, though marked fluctuations are recorded. The last big cycle peaked in 2009 - 2010. Following years were lower but in the middle of the range of biomass for the period 2000 - 201. Pelgas survey pointed to the highest recruitment in 2013 in subarea VIII. Catch curve analysis on survey and commercial fleets suggest fishing mortality slightly lower than natural mortality, i. e. seemingly sustainable. There is little information from subarea VII: no survey index is available and catches are not monitored for biological sampling, so little can be done in terms of assessing the population and the fishery in this subarea, except assuming trends would be similar to subarea VIII. There is no international TAC for these fisheries. Catch are mainly taken by France and Spain in VIIIa,b,d and by France, Netherlands and United Kingdom in VII. For the southern Horse mackerel (Division IXa) a new analytical assessment was carried out following the stock annex, with catches up to 2012 and surveys up to 2011 (as the 2012 survey could not take place). The fishery is shared between Portugal and Spain. The estimated SSB shows some decrease since 2007 but with a wide confidence interval (being estimated around 30 % below the long term average). The fishing mortality shows a significant decrease in last two years. Recruitment is estimated to be above average in 2011. No precautionary reference points have been defined for this stock. F 35 %SPR (0. 11) is proposed as a proxy for FMSY. Historical fishing mortalities have on average (0. 09) been at or below the candidate FMSY (though actual estimates are very uncertain). Catch options were provided under the assumption of historical geometric mean recruitment. For the Jack mackerel (Trachurus picturatus) in the waters of the Azores, though the 2012 advice is biennial and valid for 2013 and 2014, the WG continue the collation of data along with some exploratory analysis of that information. The analysis is based on commercial abundance indices from the main fleets, used as an indicator of stock trends. It was noted that catches in 2012 reduced compared to previous years: According to the length and age composition of catches from the purse seine fishery, which target juveniles, this was probably due to a failure of recruits at age 1 in 2012. Although the tuna <b>baitboats</b> do not show a sharp de-crease in cpue as the purse seine fleet for 2012, this could be explained since the bait boats also catch bait offshore when jack mackerel is not available in the coast. As occasional fluctuations of 1 or 2 years have also happened in the past this was not considered to suppose a major warning on the status of the stock or for the fishery. In addition the WG was asked to report on the advance of the preparation of the benchmarking for Anchovy in Subarea IXa; the WG recommended to delay the benchmarking to 2015, basically due to limited man power and to allow for the new DEPM 2014 survey to be examined by WGACEGGs in Nov 2014 and serve as a new input the Benchmark. Finally the WG proposes in Annex 4 specific actions to be taken to improve the quality and transmission of the data (including improvements in data collection and potential inputs from RACs), as requested to the group...|$|E
40|$|The Ghanaian tuna {{fishery is}} a <b>baitboat</b> and purse seine fishery. Three main species of tuna are caught namely, Skipjack, Bigeye and Yellowfin. A {{detailed}} and comprehensive set of catch and effort {{data for the}} tuna fisheries has been obtained for the period 1980 - 2001. Harvest functions have been designed and estimated. By maximising the loglikelihood function by numerical methods, parameter estimates and performance indicators of the different models were obtained. The best result was obtained for a harvest model allowing inclusion of a time trend parameter. For this model the stockoutput elasticity {{is assumed to be}} 1, the effort-output elasticity is estimated at 0. 849, and the technological change at about 3. 6 % annual increase in productivity. Technical – Economic interactions among the species have been analysed. Different periods where chosen for each period, cross – elasticity of supply calculated between the species. The result indicated a mixed significance, which gives room for the existence of technical – economic interactions among the species over the years, considered. This suggests that single species management may be inappropriate for the tuna fishery...|$|R

40|$|Updated {{standardized}} {{relative abundance}} indices by age are presented for bluefin tuna <b>baitboat</b> fishery in the Bay of Biscay from 1975 to 2007. Standardization {{was carried out}} using generalized linear mixed models. Catch and effort data on bluefin tuna were available from catches by trip; this catch by commercial category was converted to catch at age by applying seasonal age length keys to the length distribution by commercial category. In this update age length keys were reviewed. Data were modeled using the delta-lognormal model. The model included the following explanatory factors: Year, Age, Month and Year × Age fixed factors, plus a selection of other factors contributing with {{a significant percentage of}} the total explained deviance in the aggregated model. All Year interactions besides the Year × Age factor were considered as random. CVs of present standardized index are less variable than the previous standardization time series from 1975 to 2004, but still some variability was found for the last years when larger vessels built recently were included in the analysis. The revised age length keys seem to be reducing CVs variability in the study period. The standardized index of ages 2, 3 and 4 show a downward tendency in the last years. RÉSUM...|$|R
40|$|The oceanic tuna fishery uses four {{principal}} gear types, longline, purse seine, {{pole and}} line (or <b>baitboat),</b> and troll, deployed by fishing vessels from approximately 25 different countries and territories. Each gear type may be deployed {{in a variety of}} configurations to target a particular species of fish. Longliners deploy numerous baited hooks arranged on lines up to 75 n. mi. in length. The number of hooks deployed and the depths at which they operate are adjusted to target different species in different regions of the ocean. The range of depths fished by tuna longliners has shifted to deeper layers during the last 50 years so that the catchability coefficient (the probability that a hook will catch a fish) has changed over time in various ways for various species. Surface fisheries generally depend on aggregations of tunas. Purse-seine fisheries operate by surrounding surface aggregations of fish with large nets that can be closed under the aggregation. Purse-seiners may target free-swimming tuna schools or dolphin associated schools composed primarily of large yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), or they mayexploit a variety of naturally occurring and artificial floating objects, fish-aggregating devices (FADs), which attract mixed schools of skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), small yellowfin and bigeye (Thunnus obesus) tunas.

40|$|Working Group ICCAT July 2008; Florianopolis, BrasilThe PROCEAN (PRoduction Catch / Effort ANalysis) {{model is}} a multi-fleet biomass dynamic model {{developed}} in a Bayesian framework to conduct stock assessments based on catch and effort time series data. PROCEAN {{was applied to the}} eastern component of the Atlantic skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis) to assess the current status of the stock and provide reference points to fishery managers. Data included 8 time series of catch and effort data spanning from 1969 to 2006 and mostly standardised based on generalized linear modelling techniques. Informative priors and constraints for some parameters were used to allow the model to converge. Model fits were generally good but indicated increasing trends in the residuals for some fishing fleets. Results suggested that the eastern Atlantic skipjack stock would be underexploited, with a biomass in 2006 equal to 1. 8 times the biomass at the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and a fishing mortality in 2006 equal to 30 % of the fishing mortality at MSY (FMSY). A sensitivity analysis performed to account for uncertainty in some input parameters showed that FMSY estimates were robust to parameter changes while MSY estimates were sensitive to the prior distribution for MSY. Based on the different model runs, the MSY was estimated to be comprised between 152, 000 and 185, 000 t. The use of random walks on catchability was useful for tracking changes in catchability and associated increasing fishing power for some <b>baitboat</b> fishing fleets targeting skipjack...|$|R

40|$|Catch-at-size data of {{the eastern}} Atlantic {{skipjack}} were used to estimate changes in total mortality from 1969 to 2007. We used a transitional model of mean length that generalized the Beverton-Holt mortality estimator to allow change in mortality rate under nonequilibrium conditions. Then, from homogeneous periods of time, length-converted catch curves were used to access qualitative changes in selectivity patterns for two surface fisheries (the <b>baitboat</b> fishery operating from Dakar, Senegal, and the European and associated purse seine fisheries). To explore the impact of catch on the mortality rate, a Bayesian change-point analysis {{was conducted on the}} catch time series to detect concomitant variation between mortality rates and catch. Finally, potential causes of these changes are discussed in relation to the implementation of new fishing technology, such fish aggregating devices (FAD). The general pattern depicted by total mortality is in agreement with previous knowledge on this fishery: a state of complete or practically complete exploitation during the nineties followed by the decrease in nominal purse seine fishing effort in the last decade, combined with the effect of a seasonal moratorium on FAD fishing operations. There was no evidence of a change in selectivity between the two contrasted periods of time considered: 1969 - 1979 and 1986 - 1999; the second period being characterized by the introduction of new technology onboard vessels. In contrast, the covariation over time between total catch and mortality rate three years later highlights the effect of the fishing pressure on the stock of eastern Atlantic skipjack...|$|R
40|$|This {{economic}} {{history of the}} U. S. tuna industry focuses on the industry 2 ̆ 7 s technological and structural development during the last half century. Important technological changes include the growth in scale {{and complexity of the}} <b>baitboat,</b> the emergence of the modern tuna purse seiner, and the growth in scale of canneries. Important structural changes include the industry 2 ̆ 7 s early evolution from a competitive industry spun off from the sardine industry, to a tight vertically integrated oligopoly by WWII, to a weak unintegrated oligopoly today. Also examined are the roles of government policies and other institutions, the growth of foreign competition, imports, and industry globalization. A brief examination of the evolution of the 20 th-century Japanese tuna industry enables a comparison with the development of its U. S. rival. ^ Of special interest in the study is the question as to whether there is a causal link between the tuna industry 2 ̆ 7 s technological and structural evolution. That is, has the industry 2 ̆ 7 s technological evolution been shaped by its structural and competitive evolution, and vice versa? The general hypothesis of a link between technological change and competition has a long history, dating at least from the classical and Marxian economists, through to today 2 ̆ 7 s game theorists and modern institutionalists. Particular attention is paid to the hypotheses developed by Joseph Schumpeter, who most forcefully set forth the argument that imperfect competition is necessary (if not sufficient) for technological advance in a capitalist economy. The author also contributes some preliminary work on a dynamic isoquant {{that can be used to}} examine the replacement of old technology with new technology. The intuitive implications of these various theories and views concerning the technology-competition link are examined for their relevance and usefulness in explaining observed events in the tuna industry. The author concludes that there is sufficient support for the hypothesized link in the tuna industry, on the basis of an array of consistencies between the theories 2 ̆ 7 implications and observed events in the tuna industry 2 ̆ 7 s history. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{growth rate}} of a fish is a {{fundamental}} function used in stock assessments to estimate the population size and the fishery pressure affecting the species. There has been recent debate within the stock assessment community regarding which type of growth model best represents the true {{growth rate of}} yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), in the Atlantic Ocean; specifically, should assessments use a traditional von Bertalanffy growth curve or a so-called “two-stanza” growth curve, which combines one growth rate for smaller individual tuna and another for larger sizes. Using a simulated population created with the software R, both growth models were compared under different scenarios. The {{first part of this}} thesis examines the effect of different fisheries and their associated gear selectivity. Purse seine, <b>baitboat</b> and pelagic longline fisheries, which target yellowfin tuna in the Atlantic Ocean, were incorporated into the analysis. The second part looks at different sources of variability that occur either in nature (observation error) or in the process of analysis (process error). These include different growth variation, looking only at the fast growing young fish and using a set birth date versus a spawning period. These scenarios were used to determine if the sample, derived from a fishery-dependent sample, reflects the true population. Three populations of yellowfin tuna were created: an un-fished population, a fished population from stock assessment data, and a fished population from simulation software called ‘Population Simulator’. These populations were all analyzed for the different scenarios as well as the different fisheries. The final part of this thesis looks at three similar tuna species; skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), bigeye (Thunnus obesus) and albacore (Thunnus alalunga). The same scenarios and gear selectivities were applied to these tuna species. The results of this study showed that the two-stanza growth curve was not a better fit for yellowfin tuna population in the Atlantic Ocean than the traditional von Bertalanffy growth curve. There were several scenarios that favored the two-stanza growth curve, but either it was a sample population not representative of the Atlantic Ocean population, or the two-stanza had no initial growth rate, making it the same as a traditional growth curve. Based on these results, it was evident that the traditional von Bertalanffy growth curve was the more accurate growth curve to use for yellowfin tuna in the Atlantic Ocean and it is recommended that this growth curve be used in the stock assessments going forward...|$|R
