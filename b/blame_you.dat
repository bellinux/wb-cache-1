In the Indian Ocean Caesar caught fire and was almost destroyed, and after stopping at Cape Town, the Indiaman visited St Helena, where Amherst, Maxwell {{and the other}} officers {{were introduced to the}} former French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, then a prisoner on the island. At the meeting Bonaparte recalled Maxwell's conduct in the action of November 1811 and commended him on his victory, saying [...] "Vous êtes très méchant. Eh bien! Your government must not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> for the loss of the Alceste, for you have taken one of my frigates".|$|E

During a stop at St Helena, Maxwell met Napoleon, who remembered the action on 29 November 1811 when Alceste had captured La Pomone, and remarked, [...] "...your government must not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> {{for the loss of}} Alceste, for you have taken one of my frigates." [...] The requisite court martial exonerated Maxwell, his officers, and his crew of the loss of Alceste. Maxwell received much praise for his actions, and £1500 from the East India Company. He was knighted in 1818.|$|E
500|$|In France, {{the action}} had more {{significant}} consequences. The loss of two ships and over 200 cannon {{was a serious}} blow to the French army marshalling in the Balkans. Napoleon himself {{took an interest in}} the engagement and it has been suggested by British historian James Henderson that this action convinced Napoleon of his inability to control the Adriatic Sea, which was vital to launching operations in the Balkans. This action may have been a factor in his decision to abandon plans to invade the Ottoman Empire, and instead to turn his attention on Russia. In the French Navy, the flight of Pauline was deemed cowardly and Captain Montfort was court-martialled and relieved of command. In 1817, when Murray Maxwell visited St Helena on his return from the East Indies where HMS Alceste had been wrecked, Napoleon greeted him with the words [...] "Your government must not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> for the loss of Alceste, for you have taken one of my frigates".|$|E

500|$|Increasing {{territorial}} {{conflict between}} the Sioux and the Ojibwe on the western frontier, particularly along the Mississippi river, led the U.S. government to attempt to mediate the conflicts. President Andrew Jackson's policy toward the tribes ultimately was to either pacify them sufficiently to allow westward expansion of American settlers, or else remove the tribes from {{the areas in which}} they prevented settlement. The First Treaty of Prairie du Chien (1825), among its provisions established southern Minnesota as well as much of modern North and South Dakota as the homeland of the Dakota Sioux. The Ojibwe were given northern Minnesota and much of Wisconsin. The U.S. government, though, failed to enforce the treaty agreements leading to Little Crow's pronouncement to Indian agent Taliaferro in 1829: [...] "We made peace to please you, but if we are badly off we must <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> for causing us to give up so much of our lands to our enemies." ...|$|E

[...] "I have come here to kill you," [...] said [...] [...] "Then people will not feel the pangs of hunger {{and they will not}} starve for want of food." [...] "I do not <b>blame</b> <b>you</b> for wanting me dead," [...] said [...] [...] "But if you kill us, people will lose their taste for food. They will never know the pleasure of cooking and eating. But if we live, they will continue to plant seeds and harvest crops, and they will remain skilled hunters." [...] After hearing these words, Monster Slayer returned without a trophy.|$|E
2500|$|The Miracles (also {{known as}} Smokey Robinson and the Miracles from 1965 to 1972) were an American {{rhythm and blues}} vocal group {{that was the first}} {{successful}} recording act for Berry Gordy's Motown Records, {{and one of the most}} important and influential groups in pop, rock and roll, and R music history. Formed in 1955 by Smokey Robinson, Warren [...] "Pete" [...] Moore, and Ronnie White, the group started off as the Five Chimes, changing their name to the Matadors two years later. The group then settled on the Miracles after the inclusion of Claudette Robinson in 1958. The most notable Miracles line-up included the Robinsons, Moore, White, Bobby Rogers and Marv Tarplin. After a failed audition with Brunswick Records, the group began working with songwriter Berry Gordy, who helped to produce their first records for the End and Chess labels before establishing Tamla Records in 1959 and signing the Miracles as its first act. The group eventually scored the label's first million-selling hit record with the 1960 Grammy Hall of Fame smash, [...] "Shop Around", and further established themselves as one of Motown's top acts with the hit singles [...] "You've Really Got a Hold on Me", [...] "What's So Good About Goodbye", [...] "Way Over There", [...] "I'll Try Something New", [...] "Mickey's Monkey", [...] "Going to a Go-Go", [...] "(Come 'Round Here) I'm the One You Need", [...] "Just A Mirage", [...] "If You Can Want", [...] "More Love", [...] "I Don't <b>Blame</b> <b>You</b> at All", [...] "Ooo Baby Baby", The multi-award-winning [...] "The Tracks of My Tears", [...] "Special Occasion", [...] "I Second That Emotion", [...] "Baby Baby Don't Cry", the number-one Pop smashes [...] "The Tears of a Clown" [...] and [...] "Love Machine", [...] "Do It Baby", and [...] "My Girl Has Gone", among numerous other hits.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes. You are {{stifling}} it. I {{say again}} that I'm not <b>blaming</b> <b>you,</b> Hugh. You are made differently from me. All you care for, really, is your career. You {{may think that}} you care, at times, for--other things, but it isn't so." ...|$|R

2500|$|However, due to {{constant}} {{changes in}} the music industry and Motown, by 1969, Smokey Robinson sought to leave the Miracles and the stage, to settle for continued work as Motown's vice president as well as become more of a family man to his wife Claudette and their children. The year 1969 had brought a second Ed Sullivan Show appearance for the group, singing their then-current singles [...] "Doggone Right", and their hit cover of Dion's [...] "Abraham, Martin and John". Robinson's departure plans however, were thwarted after the group's 1969 song [...] "Baby Baby Don't Cry" [...] hit the Billboard Pop Top 10, and when the Miracles' 1967 song, [...] "The Tears of a Clown", was released as a single in 1970, it became a number-one hit in the UK. It was subsequently released in the U.S., where it duplicated its U.K. success, reaching number 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 Pop Chart and selling over 3 million copies. As a result, the Miracles became hotter than ever, and Robinson decided to stay with the group for another two years. In 1970, the group were given their own ABC television special, The Smokey Robinson Show, which starred the Miracles, with guest stars the Supremes, the Temptations, Stevie Wonder, and Fran Jeffries. In 1971, they scored one more top 20 hit with 1971's [...] "I Don't <b>Blame</b> <b>You</b> At All". In 1972, Robinson made good on his promise to leave the Miracles, starting a six-month tour which ended in July 1972 at Washington, D.C., later introducing Billy Griffin as his official replacement. This series of final live Miracles concerts with Robinson was released by Motown on the double album [...] (Tamla TS320). About that final tour, Miracle Pete Moore stated: [...] "We had 12 farewell engagements playing to sold-out houses. It was amazing." [...] Also released that year was the group's final studio album with Smokey, Flying High Together, with its lead single [...] "We've Come Too Far to End It Now" [...] reaching the Billboard R Top Ten. After Smokey's retirement, Billy Griffin was introduced to national television audiences on NBC's The Midnight Special, on an episode guest-starring the Miracles and hosted by Smokey Robinson, broadcast on July 13, 1973. Within a year afterwards, Marv Tarplin also decided to leave the group and continued working with Robinson on his solo material, while Claudette, who had essentially retired from the Miracles' live performances in 1964, permanently left the Miracles when her husband Smokey did, retiring from recording with them as well.|$|E
