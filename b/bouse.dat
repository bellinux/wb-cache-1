In his 2000 book Wildlife Films, <b>Bousé</b> makes a stronger correlation between Annaud's film and Disney's Dumbo (1941), in that both young animals lost their mothers at an early age, creating an unfortunate situation that allows {{the rest of the}} plot to develop (although, Dumbo's mother was merely imprisoned for a while, and was re-united with her son at the film's end). Dumbo and The Bear also share a similarly purposed dream sequence, brought on by alcohol in the former and hallucinogenic mushrooms in the latter.|$|E

As it runs through the community, the railroad to its northeast cuts most of the town in half, with a commercial areas both southwest and northeast of the roadway, but none along the railroad. Exiting <b>Bouse,</b> the highway enters an area dotted with farms spread among the desert, passing the communities of McVay and Utting.

Between 1951 and 1958, SR 72 was removed from the SR 95 junction near the southern city limit of Parker to the California state line. This section was added as part of a northern extension of SR 95.

60|$|His next {{argument}} practically is that hallucinations {{are always}} only {{a kind of}} dreams.[11] He proves this by {{the large number of}} coincidental hallucinations which occurred in sleepy circumstances.

Now, in Dr. Parish's opinion, we must argue that they were not awake, or not much; so the hallucinations were mere dreams. Dreams are so numerous that coincidences in dreams can be got rid of as pure flukes. People may say, to be sure, 'I am used to dreams, and don't regard them; this was something solitary in my experience.' But we must not mind what people say.|$|R

6000|$|And now I {{am going}} to tell a fact, which I doubt much my readers will {{hesitate}} to believe; but if they do, they are welcome not to believe a word in this whole history--for nothing which it contains is more true. It must be known then that the nose of Antony the Trumpeter was of a very lusty size, strutting boldly from his countenance like a mountain of Golconda, being sumptuously bedecked with rubies and other precious stones, the true regalia of a king of good fellows, which jolly Bacchus grants to all who <b>bouse</b> it heartily at the flagon. Now thus it happened, that bright and early in the morning, the good Antony, having washed his burly visage, was leaning over the quarter-railing of the galley, contemplating it in the glassy wave below. Just at this moment the illustrious sun, breaking in all his splendor from behind a high bluff of the Highlands, did dart one of his most potent beams full upon the refulgent nose of the sounder of brass; the reflection of which shot straightway down, hissing hot, into the water, and killed a mighty sturgeon that was sporting beside the vessel! This huge monster being with infinite labor hoisted on board, furnished a luxurious repast to all the crew, being accounted of excellent flavor, excepting about the wound, where it smacked a little of brimstone; and this, on my veracity, {{was the first time that}} ever sturgeon was eaten in those parts by Christian people.[49] ...|$|E
60|$|First of {{all came}} the Van Brummels, who inhabit the {{pleasant}} {{borders of the}} Bronx: these were short fat men, wearing exceeding large trunk-breeches, and were renowned for feats of the trencher; {{they were the first}} inventors of suppawn, or mush and milk. Close in their rear marched the Van Vlotens, or Kaats-kill, horrible quavers of new cider, and arrant braggarts in their liquor. After them came the Van Pelts of Groodt Esopus, dexterous horsemen, mounted upon goodly switch-tailed steeds of the Esopus breed; these were mighty hunters of minks and musk-rats, whence came the word Peltry. Then the Van Nests of Kinderhoeck, valiant robbers of birds' nests, as their name denotes; to these, if report may be believed, are we indebted for the invention of slap-jacks, or buckwheat cakes. Then the Van Higginbottoms, of Wapping's Creek; these came armed with ferrules and birchen rods, being a race of schoolmasters, who first discovered the marvelous sympathy between the seat of honor and the seat of intellect. Then the Van Grolls, of Antony's Nose, who carried their liquor in fair round little pottles, by reason they could not <b>bouse</b> it out of their canteens, having such rare long noses. Then the Gardeniers, of Hudson and thereabouts, distinguished by many triumphant feats: such as robbing water-melon patches, smoking rabbits out of their holes, and the like, and by being great lovers of roasted pigs' tails; these were the ancestors of the renowned congressman of that name. Then the Van Hoesens, of Sing-Sing, great choristers and players upon the jewsharp; these marched two and two, singing the great song of St. Nicholas. Then the Couenhovens of Sleepy Hollow; these gave birth to a jolly race of publicans, who first discovered the magic artifice of conjuring a quart of wine into a pint bottle. Then the Van Kortlandts, who lived on the wild banks of the Croton, and were great killers of wild ducks, being much spoken of for their skill in shooting with the long bow. Then the Van Bunschotens, of Nyack and Kakiat, who were the first that did ever kick with the left foot; they were gallant bush-whackers and hunters of raccoons by moonlight. Then the Van Winkles, of Haerlem, potent suckers of eggs, and noted for running of horses, and running up of scores at taverns; they were the first that ever winked with both eyes at once. Lastly came the Knickerbockers, of the great town of Schaghtikoke, where the folk lay stones upon the houses in windy weather, lest they should be blown away. These derive their name, as some say, from Knicker, to shake, and Beker, a goblet, indicating thereby that they were sturdy toss-pots of yore; but, in truth, it was derived from Knicker, to nod, and Boeken, books; plainly meaning that they were great nodders or dozers over books; from them did descend the writer of this history.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{currently}} important tasks that political economy has {{to cope with}} is to formulate a long-term consumption model. Such a model, being an optimal combination of all-social preferences with individual ones, should speed up {{the social and economic}} development to the highest degree. Admittedly houses occupy a special position among all the consumer goods. There has been definite improvements in the housing Situation, which is only another notable social and economic achievement of People's Poland. Over the years 1946 - 1970 the number of dwellings rose by 65 %, which despite an increase of the population number by as much 36, 6 %, resulted in decresing the average number of persons per one housing unit and per one room by 0, 87 and 0, 80 respectively. Notwithstanding these achievements the improvement rate in the housing situation lagged behind the rate of beneficial changes in meeting other social needs, material and cultural. Also, as viewed against most other European countries, the <b>bousing</b> situation in Poland improved at a slover rate. In the years 1971 - 1990 changes in the demographic structure will cause the household number to increase particularly quickly, thus necessitating a rise in the residential construction output over that period. Other factors, which considerably influence the housebuilding volume through the housing requirements include: population country — to — town migration and necessity to replace the housing stock technically and economicly used-up. Since, in the period 1971 - 1990, both these factors will appear in Poland especially strong, the housing requirements can be fully met only through building 8 million dwelling units.
