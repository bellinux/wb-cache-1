25|$|After her 1886–87 tour, Bernhardt recuperated on Belle-Île, a {{small island}} off the coast of Brittany, 10 miles south of the Quiberon peninsula. She {{purchased}} a ruined 17th-century fortress, located {{at the end of the}} island and approached by a drawbridge, and turned it into her vacation retreat. Between 1886 and 1922, she spent nearly every summer, the season when her theater was closed, on Belle-Île. She built bungalows for her son Maurice and her grandchildren, and bungalows with studios for her close friends, the painters Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She also took with her her large collection of animals, including several dogs, two horses, a donkey, a hawk given to her by the Russian Grand Duke Alexis, an Andean wildcat, and a boa constrictor she had brought <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> tour of South America. She entertained many visitors at Belle-Île, including King Edward VII, who stopped by the island on a cruise aboard the royal yacht. Always wrapped in white scarves, she played tennis (under house rules that required that she be the winner) and cards, read plays, and created sculptures and ornaments in her studio. When the fishermen of the island suffered a bad season, she organized a benefit performance with leading actors to raise funds for them. She gradually enlarged the estate, purchasing a neighboring hotel and all the land with a view of the property, but in 1922, as her health declined, she abruptly sold it and never returned. During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the island, and in October 1944, before leaving the island, they dynamited most of the compound. All that remains is the original old fort, and a seat cut into the rock where Bernhardt awaited the boat that took her to the mainland.|$|E

500|$|According to Maz Hallima of Flavour Magazine, [...] "Do Ya Thang" [...] {{has a very}} [...] "teenager-ish vibe" [...] which {{according}} to her works well, however she is aware why Rihanna kept it as a bonus track of the album. Sam Lansky of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that the song [...] "can't be beat for sheer likability". He further noted that Rihanna is stepping <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> [...] "hypersexual persona to sing a more earnest, good-natured tune". Michael Jepson of The Fourth State concluded that [...] "Do Ya Thang", together with [...] "Cockiness (Love It)" [...] and [...] "Roc Me Out", are the top candidates from Talk That Talk that can be labeled as the album's [...] "highlights". According to Jepson, all three songs are [...] "blatantly raunchy" [...] and feel like a follow up to Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "S" [...] (Loud, 2011). Shaun Kitchener of EntertainmentWise concluded that Rihanna [...] "takes a breather for 'Do Ya Thang', and we get a rare glimpse of Sweet Loving Rihanna instead." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{role of the}} Evil Queen/Regina went to Lana Parrilla. She {{explained}} the character, [...] "There's always two stories being told when playing Regina. There's the threat of her knowing she's an evil queen and then there's just the pure simple fact that the biological mother has stepped into her world {{and the threat of}} losing her son is just enormous. That's a fear that I think any adopted mother would have. I think that's going to really help the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would never accept the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> management staff.|$|E

Frank and Bobby then start a relationship and soon marry; but both Papps and Dickson felt that their characters were too young. Papps left the series in May 1989 to join the cast of The Flying Doctors. Frank's departure storyline soon aired with his marriage to Bobby failing and him leaving her to be with Roo.

2500|$|The Brahmana literature, one of {{the layer}} within the ancient Vedic texts, dated about 1000 BCE – 500 BCE are entirely silent about sati {{according}} to the historian Altekar. Similarly, the Grhyasutras, a body of text devoted to ritual, with composition date {{about the time of}} the youngest within Brahmana literature, sati is not mentioned, either. What is mentioned concerning funeral rites, though, is that the widow is to be brought <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> husband's funeral pyre, either by his brother, or by a trusted servant. In the Taittiriya Aranyaka from about the same time, it is said that when leaving, the widow took from her husband's side such objects as his bow, gold and jewels (which previously would have been burnt with him), and a hope expressed that the widow and her relatives would lead a happy and prosperous life afterwards. According to Altekar, it is [...] "clear" [...] that the custom of actual widow burning had died out a long time previously at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|Several design {{issues on}} the new cruisers had {{to be worked out}} by C before a {{proposed}} design could be finalized. Bowles was concerned over what he considered inadequate protection in the Pennsylvanias, especially the thin deck armor near the main magazines. British designs placed these magazines well below the ship's waterline and far <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> sides but tended to be much smaller than in US designs. Since US cruisers generally carried heavier armament than their British counterparts, this necessitated magazines with greater volume to ensure adequate ammunition. In his 14,500 proposed design labeled [...] "F," [...] Bowles extended the casemate armor to include the turrets and increased the ship's beam slightly to compensate for the added weight. He also wanted to make the side armor one inch thinner than in the Pennsylvanias and concentrate the 6-inch guns at the ends of the ships to increase the areas covered by their protection.|$|E

[...] The reviewer commented on Lewis' styling: [...] "Her long dark hair is swept <b>back</b> <b>from</b> <b>her</b> face, aside from her ruffled fringe, while two black stars have been carefully applied below her eyes, adding to the overall dramatic effect." [...] Becky Bain from music website Idolator, commented that although [...] "Lewis looks beautiful", the image processing makes her look [...] "incredibly washed out in this over-saturated photo"; Bain was less impressed with the star-like beauty marks on her face.

2500|$|Art is an {{approximately}} 9-foot tall (274.32cm) {{statue of}} a young female figure wearing a floor-length tunic underneath an intricately tied outer garment, which is pinned at her proper left shoulder with a fibula.

She stands with her weight on both feet, with her proper right foot extended slightly forward of her proper left. There are several dots of an unknown black substance on the marble base underneath her feet, in front of her proper left foot.
