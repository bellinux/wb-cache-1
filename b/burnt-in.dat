60|$|CAIN. Why, {{it gave me}} right. It {{said that}} my deed was as a mark on me, a <b>burnt-in</b> mark such as Abel put on his sheep, that no man should slay me. And here I stand unslain, whilst the cowards who have never slain, the men who are content to be their brothers' keepers instead of their masters, are despised and rejected, and slain like rabbits. He who bears the brand of Cain shall rule the earth. When he falls, he shall be avenged sevenfold: the Voice has said it; so beware how you plot against me, you and all the rest.|$|E
60|$|Courtier sat in Hyde Park {{waiting for}} five o'clock. The day had {{recovered}} somewhat from a grey morning, {{as though the}} glow of that long hot summer were too <b>burnt-in</b> on the air to yield to the first assault. The sun, piercing the crisped clouds, those breast feathers of heavenly doves, darted its beams at the mellowed leaves, and showered to the ground their delicate shadow stains. The first, too early, scent from leaves about to fall, penetrated to the heart. And sorrowful sweet birds were tuning their little autumn pipes, blowing into them fragments of Spring odes to Liberty.|$|E

But I confined myself to the boy-life out on the Mississippi because that had a peculiar charm for me, and not because I was not familiar with other phases of life. I was a soldier two weeks once {{in the beginning of}} the war, and was hunted like a rat the whole time. Familiar? My splendid Kipling himself hasn't a more <b>burnt-in,</b> hard-baked, and unforgetable familiarity with that death-on-the-pale-horse-with-hell-following-after, which is a raw soldier's first fortnight in the field--and which, without any doubt, is the most tremendous fortnight and the vividest he is ever going to see.|$|E
6000|$|... .... I've {{made a new}} acquaintance. I {{was lying}} in the orchard, and presently, not seeing me, he came along--a man of middle height, with a {{singularly}} good balance, and no lumber--rather old blue clothes, a flannel shirt, a dull red necktie, brown shoes, a cap with a leather peak pushed up on the forehead. Face long and narrow, bronzed {{with a kind of}} pale <b>burnt-in</b> brownness; a good forehead. A brown moustache, beard rather pointed, blackening about the cheeks; his chin not visible, but from the beard's growth must be big; mouth I should judge sensuous. Nose straight and blunt; eyes grey, with an upward look, not exactly frank, because defiant; two parallel furrows down each cheek, one from the inner corner of the eye, one from the nostril; age perhaps thirty-five. About the face, attitude, movements, something immensely vital, adaptable, daring, and unprincipled.|$|E

50|$|As {{opposed to}} hiring Shochiku staff, crew from the {{independent}} studio Ninjin Club were used instead. Kobayashi utilized cinematographer Yoshio Miyajima for the film, having been {{an admirer of}} his work for director Fumio Kamei. Despite featuring extensive dialogue in Mandarin, none of the actors were actually Chinese. These lines were spoken phonetically with accompanying <b>burnt-in</b> Japanese subtitles on all prints. Non-Japanese and Russians were seemingly used for the roles of Soviet soldiers, though only Ed Keene and Ronald Self are credited. Due to the non-existent China-Japan relations at the time, Kobayashi scouted out filming locations in Hokkaido for the Manchurian setting over a two-month period. Including pre-production, The Human Condition took four years to complete.|$|E
50|$|Ghost Light was {{released}} on VHS in May 1994. A DVD release followed in September 2004, with many extended and deleted scenes included as bonus features. However, unlike the situation with The Curse of Fenric, these scenes no longer existed in broadcast quality as the master 625 line PAL colour videotapes containing the extra footage had been erased for reuse shortly after the story was broadcast, and were thus sourced from VHS copies, some with timecodes <b>burnt-in,</b> i.e. recorded permanently onto the picture. This made an extended edit, as had been prepared for the Curse of Fenric DVD release the previous year, impossible. This serial was also released {{as part of the}} Doctor Who DVD Files in Issue 96 on 5 September 2012.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. PRINTcipher is {{a recent}} {{lightweight}} block cipher designed by Knudsen et al. Some noteworthy characteristics are a <b>burnt-in</b> key, a key-dependent permutation layer and identical round keys. Independent work on PRINTcipher has identified weak key classes that allow for a key recovery — the obvious countermeasure is to avoid these weak keys {{at the cost of}} a small loss of key entropy. This paper identifies several larger classes of weak keys. We show how to distinguish classes of keys and give a 28 -round linear attack applicable to half the keys. We show that there are several similar attacks, each focusing on a specific class of keys. We also observe how some specific properties of PRINTcipher allow us to collect several samples from each plaintext–ciphertext pair. We use this property to construct an attack on 29 -round PRINTcipher applicable to a fraction 2 − 5 of the keys...|$|E
40|$|As many {{products}} {{are becoming increasingly}} more reliable, traditional lifetime-based burn-in approaches that try to fail defective units during the test require a long burn-in duration, and thus are not effective. Therefore, we promote the degradation-based burn-in approach that bases the screening decision on the degradation level of a <b>burnt-in</b> unit. Motivated by the infant mortality faced by many Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems (MEMSs), this study develops two degradation-based joint burn-in and maintenance models under the age and the block based maintenances, respectively. We assume that the product population comprises a weak and a normal subpopulations. Degradation of the product follows Wiener processes with linear drift, while the weak and the normal subpopulations possess distinct drift parameters. The objective of joint burn-in and maintenance decisions is to minimize the long run average cost per unit time during field use by properly choosing the burn-in settings and the preventive replacement intervals. An example using the MEMS devices demonstrates effectiveness of these two models. 漏 2012 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The growing {{acceptance}} of flip chip technology in assembly and manufacturing {{of a broad}} scope of products is facing similar issues, as wirebonding for COB and MCM's before. Repair issues due to intrinsically defective dies, having passed standard electrical tests but no burn-in, tend to challenge the cost and performance benefits of bare die attach. Testing and burning-in of bare, unpackaged dies (yielding so called "Known Good Dies") requires sophisticated test equipment while providing only low throughput. Over the last decade, a number of wafer level bum in concepts have evolved, {{the majority of them}} focusing on IC's dedicated for wirebond use. Only few of them found their way into production so far. Flip Chip now requires a different approach, as the dies are not to be tested before, but after bumping. Test equipment and - processes do not lend themselves readily to this task. This paper presents a novel concept for wafer level burn in dedicated for the special need s of flip chips. Using a reusable burn-in substrate, only one step is needed to realize the electrical contacts for the burn in for wafers and the bumps for the flip chip. The technology developed is described and the identified issues are explained. Reliability tests of the <b>burnt-in</b> dice are given and compared to flip chips manufactured with standard bumping methods...|$|E
40|$|Most lost-foam casting {{processes}} involve non-equilibrium solidification {{dominated by}} kinetic factors, while {{construction of a}} common dynamic solidification curve is based on pure thermodynamics, not applicable for analyses and research of non-equilibrium macro-solidification processes, and the construction mode can not be applied to non-equilibrium solidification process. In this study, {{the construction of the}} dynamic solidification curve (DSC) for the non-equilibrium macro-solidification process included: a modified method to determine the start temperature of primary austenite precipitation (TAL) and the start temperature of eutectic solidification (TES); double curves method to determine the temperature of the dendrite coherency point of primary austenite (TAC) and the temperature of eutectic cells collision point (TEC); the “technical solidus” method to determine the end temperature of eutectic reaction (TEN). For this purpose, a comparative testing of the non-equilibrium solidification temperature fields in lost-foam casting and green sand mold casting hypoeutectic gray iron was carried out. The thermal analysis results were used to construct the DSCs of both these casting methods under non-equilibrium solidification conditions. The results show that the transformation rate of non-equilibrium solidification in hypoeutectic gray cast iron is greater than that of equilibrium solidification. The eutectic solidification region presents a typical mushy solidification mode. The results also indicate that the primary austenite precipitation zone of lost-foam casting is slightly larger than that of green sand casting. At the same time, the solid fraction (fs) of the dendrite coherency points in lost-foam casting is greater than that in the green sand casting. Therefore, from these two points, lost-foam casting is more preferable for reduction of shrinkage and mechanical <b>burnt-in</b> sand tendency of the hypoeutectic gray cast iron. Due {{to the fact that the}} solidification process (from the surface to center) at primary austenite growth area in the lost-foam cylinder sample lags behind that in the green sand casting, the mushy solidification tendency of lost-foam casting is greater and the solidification time is longer...|$|E
