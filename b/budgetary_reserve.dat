40|$|Testimony {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "This testimony discusses states' plans for operating their Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) programs {{in the event of}} an economic downturn. GAO found that the data available on the levels and adequacy of states' reserves is insufficient and misleading. Furthermore, most states have done little planning for economic contingencies. Many states cite obstacles to saving money for possible economic downturns. Although TANF funds can be set aside in a <b>budgetary</b> <b>reserve,</b> state officials said that they are concerned that the accumulation of unspent TANF funds might signal that the funds are not needed. Another option for states would be to save their own funds in a general purpose rainy day account, but state officials said that welfare would have to compete with other state priorities when these funds are released from state treasuries. There are now federal contingency mechanisms for states to access additional federal resources in the event of a recession or other emergency [...] the Contingency Fund for State Welfare Programs and the Federal Loan for State Welfare Programs. However, states generally found these programs too complex and restrictive, and would most likely find other ways to sustain their welfare programs. ...|$|E

Those electives were restored in the final budget. The Board will utilize $950,422 from the <b>budgetary</b> <b>reserves</b> in order to balance the budget. This builds in a deficit for the next school year which will be compounded by the teacher pension costs increase.|$|R

40|$|Contingent {{liabilities}} {{have gained}} {{prominence in the}} analysis of public finance. Indeed, history is full of episodes in which the financial position of the public sector is substantially altered-or its true nature uncovered-as a result of government bailouts of financial or nonfinancial entities, in both the private and the public sector. The paper discusses theoretical and practical issues raised by contingent liabilities, including the rationale for taking them on, how to safeguard against the fiscal risks associated with them, how to account and budget for them, and how to disclose them. Country experiences are used to illustrate ways these issues are addressed in practice and challenges faced. The paper also points to good practices related to the mitigation, management and disclosure of risks from contingent liabilities.

40|$|This paper formulates {{and tests}} Set Covering and related models with spatial {{characteristics}} for selecting sites which provide habitat for {{species that are}} identified as “critical ” (typically threatened, endangered, or rare), thereby enhancing their persistence. The two first models require {{the creation of a}} core area for each critical species and a buffer zone surrounding the core, with and without being constrained to include at least one representation of each and every common (i. e., non-critical) species. The final model aims at minimizing costs of protecting predetermined numbers of common species while all critical species remain covered and buffered. These models are implemented on occurrence data of terrestrial mammals in Oregon. They enable, among others, the comparison of the <b>budgetary</b> impacts of <b>reserve</b> networks with and without buffering rings for critical species and to determine the marginal cost of common species protection...|$|R
5000|$|Due to <b>budgetary</b> cutbacks the <b>Reserve</b> Training Center at Reading was inactivated on 1 May 1950 and {{reassigned to}} New Castle County Airport, Delaware. The Air Force closed its {{facilities}} at Reading airport and it returned to civil control. In 1951, the Air National Guard facilities in Allentown {{was turned over}} to Air Products and Chemicals. Air Products paid $12,000/year in rent and that money was used to maintain the airport. [...] The runways were used by the Allentown Jaycees for drag racing in order to get [...] "hot rods" [...] off the City streets. This did not last long, due to objections by local residents and also by the CAA as the runways were not being used by aviation. During the 1950s several plans were made to re-develop the land, but all never materialized due to the aviation clause in the transfer document to the City in 1947.|$|R
