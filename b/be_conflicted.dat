2500|$|In 1978, Kramer {{delivered}} {{the final of}} four drafts of a novel that he wrote about the fast lifestyle of gay men of Fire Island and Manhattan. In Faggots, the primary character was modeled on himself, {{a man who is}} unable to find love while encountering the drugs and emotionless sex in the trendy bars and discos. He stated his inspiration for the novel: [...] "I wanted to be in love. Almost everybody I knew felt the same way. I think most people, at some level, wanted what I was looking for, whether they pooh-poohed it or said that we can't live like the straight people or whatever excuses they gave." [...] Kramer researched the book, talking to many men, and visiting various establishments. As he interviewed people, he heard a common question: [...] "Are you writing a negative book? Are you going to make it positive? ... I began to think, 'My God, people must really <b>be</b> <b>conflicted</b> about the lives they're leading.' And that was true. I think people were guilty about all the promiscuity and all the partying." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{two novels}} {{published}} as Jean de Chilra provide an interesting interlude, different in some key ways from the Rachilde-credited novels, despite sharing {{the themes of}} aggressive sexual deviance, obsession, and confusion between reality and illusion.

50|$|Chivalry in Medieval Spain {{cannot be}} {{understood}} {{outside of the}} context of the Military Orders of Knighthood. Historians seem to <b>be</b> <b>conflicted</b> as to whether Knights in Spanish were directed more by Castilian and Catalan-Aragonese royalty or by the Papacy. But {{there seems to be a}} consensus that the knights had obligations to both and an overarching allegiance to the Church, as both were in direct contact with knights (and often royalty were themselves knights and Crusaders). Some scholars have suggested that the later Spanish Military Orders, like that at the fortress of Calatrava, pledged their loyalty primarily to their Kingdom, in this case Castile, but orders like the Templars or Hospitallers were more independent and not necessarily loyal to any kingdom consistently.|$|E

Dawson uses his access to Watcher resources to assist Duncan on several occasions.
