25|$|The defenders' {{position}} on Kos, never enviable, soon became serious and, presently, desperate, for the Italian anti-aircraft defence was negligible {{and their own}} resources meagre. To add to their troubles, the area round the airfield they had to protect was too rocky to permit digging in, {{and there was no}} time to build <b>blast</b> <b>walls</b> before the enemy was upon them. The air attacks were so severe that casualties inflicted on the British paratroopers forced them to be withdrawn on 25 September.|$|E
25|$|During the Cold War, {{the tunnels}} were adapted to provide {{protection}} against blast and heat flash from nearby atomic detonations. Blast traps {{were added to}} both pedestrian and vehicle entrances. The pedestrian blast traps were relatively simple, consisting of three <b>blast</b> <b>walls</b> overlapping by at least three-quarters of {{the width of the}} tunnel. A more elaborate approach had to be adopted for vehicle tunnels, where L-shaped entrances equipped with blast pockets were cut. The blast pockets were intended to absorb and reflect the blast wave, preventing it reaching far inside the tunnel complex. Gas locks were also installed to protect against contamination from the outside.|$|E
25|$|There is {{controversy}} {{about whether there}} was sufficient time for more effective emergency evacuation. The main problem was {{that most of the}} personnel who had the authority to order evacuation had been killed when the first explosion destroyed the control room. This was a consequence of the platform design, which did not include <b>blast</b> <b>walls.</b> Another contributing factor was that the nearby connected platforms Tartan and Claymore continued to pump gas and oil to Piper Alpha until its pipeline ruptured in the heat in the second explosion. Their operations crews did not believe they had authority to shut off production, even though they could see that Piper Alpha was burning.|$|E

40|$|AbstractTopside {{areas on}} an {{offshore}} {{oil and gas}} platform are highly susceptible to explosion. A <b>blast</b> <b>wall</b> on these areas {{plays an important role}} in preventing explosion damage and must withstand the expected explosion loads. The uniformly distributed loading condition, predicted by Explosion Risk Analyses (ERAs), has been applied in most of the previous analysis methods. However, analysis methods related to load conditions are inaccurate because the blast overpressure around the wall tends to be of low-level in the open area and high-level in the enclosed area. The main objectives of this paper are to study the effects of applying different load applications and compare the dynamic responses of the <b>blast</b> <b>wall.</b> To do so, various kinds of blast pressures were measured by Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations on the target area. Nonlinear finite element analyses of the <b>blast</b> <b>wall</b> under two types of identified dynamic loadings were also conducted...|$|R

50|$|A revetment, in {{military}} aviation, is a parking area {{for one or}} more aircraft that is surrounded by <b>blast</b> <b>walls</b> on three sides. These walls are as much about protecting neighbouring aircraft {{as it is to}} protect the aircraft within the revetment. If a combat aircraft fully loaded with fuel and munitions was to somehow be set on fire, by accident or design, then it could start a chain reaction, as the destruction of individual aircraft could set ablaze its neighbours. The <b>blast</b> <b>walls</b> around a revetment are designed to channel blast and damage upwards and outwards away from neighbouring aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Corrugated {{panels are}} {{currently}} used in petrochemical facilities {{as an economic}} means to provide blast protection to personnel and other valuable assets. In this paper, parametric studies were conducted on the various elements (e. g., compression flange, depth, angle of corrugation, etc.) of a corrugated <b>blast</b> <b>wall</b> using static nonlinear finite element analyses and dynamic nonlinear single degree of freedom analyses. During the static analyses, panel characteristics such as ductility and strength were explored and nonlinear load-deflection curves were generated. The load-deflection curves were then used to observe the response of each wall using a single degree of freedom time-step integration method. Results showed that some <b>blast</b> <b>wall</b> profiles have a greater ability to limit reaction loads transferred to the primary structure, reduce material cost / panel thickness, and/or protect nearby assets (deformation control). The results contained herein define specific dimensional ratios for elements {{that will result in}} a favorable response.

In order to prevent the structural buckling, the vee stiffeners is employed and placed on the compressive region. A higher peak pressure was applied in order to investigate the buckling phenomena on the corrugated panel with vee stiffener. The inclined angle of vee stiffener was varied from 15 Â° to 90 Â°. The results show that an alteration of inclined angle has a considerable effect on the dynamic response of the <b>blast</b> <b>wall</b> structure, the deformed shape and the effectiveness of the stiffener due to the absorbed plastic strain energy. The best inclined angle of the vee stiffener is also determined...|$|R
