40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to evaluate whether typing of human papillomavirus (HPV) among women with low-grade cervical cytology can improve the ability to identify women with cervical cancer or cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (CIN III <b>or</b> <b>worse).</b> STUDY DESIGN: A total of 1595 women with low-grade cervical cytology participating in a randomized implementation trial of HPV triaging using Hybrid Capture II were also HPV genotyped and CIN III <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> predictive values evaluated. RESULTS: HPV 16 was detected in 57 % of cases with CIN III <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> but only among 24 % of all tested women. Testing for the 3 HPV types with highest risk (HPV 16 / 31 / 33) detected 77 % of CIN III <b>or</b> <b>worse,</b> with 36 % of women testing positive. Positivity for the other high-risk HPV types had a decreased risk for CIN III <b>or</b> <b>worse.</b> CONCLUSION: Different high-risk HPV types confer different risks for the presence of CIN III <b>or</b> <b>worse,</b> implying that HPV genotyping could be useful for the optimization of triaging strategies...|$|R

40|$|The {{screening}} {{histories of}} all 348 women with {{invasive cervical cancer}} diagnosed in 1992 in 24 self-selected district health authorities and health boards in England, Wales and Scotland were {{compared with those of}} 677 age- and residency-matched controls. The controls were randomly selected from the family health services authority (FHSA) register. Screening histories, comprising the dates and results of all smears taken before the date of diagnosis of the patient's cancer, were determined from the FHSA computer and laboratory records. We estimate that the number of cases of cervical cancer in participating districts in 1992 would have been 57 % (95 % confidence interval 28 - 86 %) greater if there had been no previous screening. In women under the age of 70 it would have been approximately 75 % (31 - 115 %) greater. Extrapolation of the results from this pilot suggests that screening prevented between 1100 and 3900 cases of invasive cervical cancer in the UK in 1992. Women with stage 1 <b>B</b> cancer <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> {{were more likely to have}} no record of previous screening than controls: 47 % of these women under the age of 70 had been adequately screened according to current (5 yearly screening) guidelines, compared with 75 % of matched controls. Thirteen per cent of all patients under age 70 had screening histories indicative of inadequate follow-up of smears requiring colposcopy. The proportion of microinvasive cases with screening predating diagnosis was similar to the proportion of controls. There was a strong correlation between stage and age: 56 % of cancers in women under 35 were microinvasive compared with just 9 % in women 65 years or over. The 'relative protection' following a negative smear was greatest in the first 12 months and fell off towards the end of the fifth year. These data suggest that full adherence to current guidelines could perhaps have prevented another 1250 cases, but additional steps would have been required to prevent some of the 2300 remaining cases in women under the age of 70...|$|R

40|$|Background Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) {{testing is}} more sensitive {{for the detection}} of high-grade cervical lesions than is cytology, but detection of HPV by DNA screening in two screening rounds 5 years apart has not been assessed. The aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether HPV DNA testing in the first screen decreases detection of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse,</b> CIN grade 2 <b>or</b> <b>worse,</b> and cervical cancer in the second screening. Methods In this randomised trial, women aged 29 - 56 years participating in the cervical screening programme in the Netherlands were randomly assigned to receive HPV DNA (GP 5 +/ 6 +-PCR method) and cytology co-testing or cytology testing alone, from January, 1999, to September, 2002. Randomisation (in a 1 : 1 ratio) was done with computer-generated random numbers after the cervical specimen had been taken. At the second screening 5 years later, HPV DNA and cytology co-testing was done in both groups; researchers were masked to the patient's assignment. The primary endpoint was the number of CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> detected. Analysis was done by intention to screen. The trial is now finished and is registered, number ISRCTN 20781131. Findings 22 420 women were randomly assigned to the intervention group and 22 518 to the control group; 19 999 in the intervention group and 20 106 in the control group were eligible for analysis at the first screen. At the second screen, 19 579 women in the intervention group and 19731 in the control group were eligible, of whom 16 750 and 16 743, respectively, attended the second screen. In the second round, CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> was less common in the intervention group than in the control group (88 of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 122 of 197 31 in the control group; relative risk 0. 73, 95 % CI 0. 55 - 0. 96; p= 0. 023). Cervical cancer was also less common in the intervention group than in the control group (four of 19 579 in the intervention group vs 14 of 19 731; 0. 29, 0. 10 - 0. 87; p= 0. 031). In the baseline round, detection of CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> did not differ significantly between groups (171 of 19 999 vs 150 of 20 106; 1. 15, 0. 92 - 1. 43; p= 0. 239) but was significantly more common in women with normal cytology (34 of 19 286 vs 12 of 19 373; 2. 85, 1. 47 - 5. 49; p= 0. 001). Furthermore, significantly more cases of CIN grade 2 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> were detected in the intervention group than in the control group (267 of 19 999 vs 215 of 20 106; 1. 25, 1. 05 - 1. 50; p= 0. 015). In the second screen, fewer HPV 16 -positive CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> were detected in the intervention group than in the control group (17 of 9481 vs 35 of 9354; 0. 48, 0. 27 - 0. 85; p= 0. 012); detection of non-HPV 16 -positive CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> did not differ between groups (25 of 9481 vs 25 of 9354; 0. 99, 0. 57 - 1. 72; p= 1. 00). The cumulative detection of CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> and CIN grade 2 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> did not differ significantly between study arms, neither for the whole study group (CIN grade 3 or worse: 259 of 19 999 vs 272 of 20 106; 0. 96, 0. 81 - 1. 14, p= 0. 631; CIN grade 2 or worse: 427 of 19 999 vs 399 of 20 106; 1. 08, 0. 94 - 1. 24; p= 0. 292), nor for subgroups of women invited for the first time (CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> in women aged 29 - 33 years: 102 of 3139 vs 105 of 3128; 0. 97, 0. 74 - 1. 27; CIN grade 2 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> in women aged 29 - 33 years: 153 of 3139 vs 151 of 3128; 1. 01, 0. 81 - 1. 26; CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> in women aged 34 - 56 years: 157 of 16 860 vs 167 of 16 978; 0. 95, 0. 76 - 1. 18; CIN grade 2 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> in women aged 34 - 56 years: 274 of 16 860 vs 248 of 16 978; 1. 11, 0. 94 - 1. 32). Interpretation Implementation of HPV DNA testing in cervical screening leads to earlier detection of clinically relevant CIN grade 2 <b>or</b> <b>worse,</b> which when adequately treated, improves protection against CIN grade 3 <b>or</b> <b>worse</b> and cervical cancer. Early detection of high-grade cervical legions caused by HPV 16 was a major component of this benefit.
