Curumim is a tool for educational robotics, at first commanded by blocks programming, which will be described in this article, but also provides the possibility to expand the horizon of students to other technological fields. Using this, even those who don´t have enough knowledge about program languages can determinate some action to the robot. In order to write the program, it is only necessary to click on the icon in menu and the block will be inserting in program’s window. Then a sequence of blocks will be created which can be executed by Curumim. It’s possible to change any parameter of the <b>block,</b> <b>delete</b> it and insert a new block between among others already fixed. For expert users, {{there is the possibility}} to use C/C++ languages to program Curumim...|$|E

40|$|Email is one {{the most}} {{important}} ways of communicating, connecting {{hundreds of millions of}} people every day. Unfortunately the medium is increasingly used for marketing purposes, which significantly affects its efficiency. For this reason email-filtering-software has been developed with the aim of protecting email users from the negative effects of unwanted emails by identifying and marking, rerouting, deleting or blocking unwanted commercial messages. This dissertation addresses the issue, whether the use of such software is legal under the scope of German and US-law. Since the use of email-filtering-software is the reaction to unwanted email communication the question whether that kind of communication is legal under the scope of both German and US-law is raised and answered first. Subsequently the dissertation examines whether it is legal to check the content and the header of incoming emails by using filtering-software under the scope of both law systems. After that the question is raised if it is legal to <b>block,</b> <b>delete,</b> mark or reroute unsolicited emails. The dissertation also verifies whether it is legal to use software to identify and prevent the receipt of virus-infected emails under the scope of German and US-law. After analyzing the relevant provisions, the regulations in both legal systems will be compared, paying particular attention to the respective solutions in each of them and their practical results, which leads to a final conclusion...|$|E

40|$|For {{strongly}} dependent data, <b>deleting</b> <b>blocks</b> {{of observations}} {{is expected to}} produce bias as in the moving block jackknife of KOnsch (1989) and Liu and Singh (1992). We propose an alternative technique which considers the <b>blocks</b> of <b>deleted</b> observations in the blockwise jackknife as missing data which are replaced by missing values estimates incorporating the observations dependence structure. Thus, the variance estimator is a weighted sample variance of the statistic evaluated in a "complete" series. We establish consistency for the variance and distribution of the sample mean. Also we extent this missing values approach to the blockwise bootstrap by assuming some missing observations among two consecutive blocks. We present {{the results of an}} extensive Monte Carlo study to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods in finite sample sizes in which it is shown that our proposal produces estimates of the variance of several time series statistics with smaller mean squared error than previous procedures...|$|R

As a result, there are a number of vistas that rise and conclude within the boundaries. Views north along Broadway, Commerce and Pacific conclude with the Elks Temple, Old City Hall and Northern Pacific Office Building. Similarly, sight lines from the eastern portion of the district terminate with the last two buildings mentioned. Views to the south along Broadway are distinctly terminated by the Winthrop and Bostwick Hotels as they are on Commerce by virtue of the dominance of the Winthrop Hotel and the Motoramp Garage.|$|R
40|$|The layered {{design of}} the Linux {{operating}} system hides the liveness of file system data from the underlying block layers. This lack of liveness information prevents the storage system from discarding <b>blocks</b> <b>deleted</b> by the file system, often resulting in poor utilization, security problems, inefficient caching, and migration overheads. In this paper, we define a generic “purge ” operation {{that can be used}} by a file system to pass liveness information to the block layer with minimal changes in the layer interfaces, allowing the storage system to discard deleted data. We present three approaches for implementing such a purge operation: direct call, zero blocks, and flagged writes, each of which differs in their architectural complexity and potential performance overhead. We evaluate the feasibility of these techniques through a reference implementation of a dynamically resizable copy on write (COW) data store in User Mode Linux (UML). Performance results obtained from this reference implementation show that all these techniques can achieve significant storage savings with a reasonable execution time overhead. At the same time, our results indicate that while the direct call approach has the best performance, the zero block approach provides the best compromise in terms of performance overhead and its semantic and architectural simplicity. Overall, our results demonstrate that passing liveness information across the file system-block layer interface with minimal changes is not only feasible but practical. 1...|$|R

Thus, we estimate the variance of a statistic as a weighted sample variance of the statistic evaluated in a “complete” series. Consistency of the variance and the distribution estimators of the sample mean are established. Also, we apply the missing values approach to the blockwise bootstrap by including some missing observations among two consecutive blocks and we demonstrate {{the consistency of the}} variance and the distribution estimators of the sample mean. Finally, we present the results of an extensive Monte Carlo study to evaluate the performance of these methods for finite sample sizes, showing that our proposal provides variance estimates for several time series statistics with smaller mean squared error than previous procedures. ...|$|R

40|$|Nicotinamide adenine {{dinucleotide}} phosphate (NADPH) oxidase (NOX) {{was originally}} identified in immune cells as playing an important microbicidal role. In stroke and cerebrovascular disease, inflammation is increasingly being recognized as contributing negatively to neurological outcome, with NOX {{as an important}} source of superoxide. Several labs have now shown that <b>blocking</b> or <b>deleting</b> NOX in the experimental stroke models protects from brain ischemia. Recent work has implicated glucose as an important NOX substrate leading to reperfusion injury, and that NOX inhibition can improve the detrimental effects of hyperglycemia on stroke. NOX inhibition also appears to ameliorate complications of thrombolytic therapy by reducing blood-brain barrier disruption, edema formation, and hemorrhage. Further, NOX from circulating inflammatory cells seems to contribute more to ischemic injury more than NOX generated from endogenous brain residential cells. Several pharmacological inhibitors of NOX are now available. Thus, blocking NOX activation may prove to be a promising treatment for stroke as well as an adjunctive agent to prevent its secondary complications. © W. S. Maney & Son Ltd 2012...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Cloud {{computing}} {{has developed}} {{as one of}} the most persuasive paradigms in the IT industry for last few years. To achieve the assertion of cloud data integrity and availability and impose the quality of dependable cloud storage service for users, an effective and flexible distributed scheme with explicit dynamic data support, including <b>block</b> update, <b>delete,</b> and append is designed. Erasure-correcting code in the file distribution preparation provides redundancy parity vectors and guarantees the data dependability. By utilizing the homomorphic token with distributed verification of erasure-coded data, this scheme achieves the integration of storage. The system safeguarded the security and dependability for cloud data storage under the aforementioned adversary model. Analysis shows the proposed scheme is highly efficient and resilient against Byzantine failure, malicious data modification attack, and even server colluding attacks. This paper enhances the work by using Raptor codes, which is an additional pre-coding on an appropriate LT-Code.
