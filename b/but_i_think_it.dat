We watch Celebrity Big Brother at the moment, we watch I'm a Celebrity, Get Me out of Here... we watch all those reality TV shows— The Office {{came out of}} those docu-soaps".|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the region is necessarily slow, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is also certain. There is every reason for expecting a steady and progressive increase in earnings for an indefinite period in the future. I am not in entire accord with the general manager's statement that the business secured from this branch may be replaced from points on our own lines. Contrary to the belief, the supplies of cedar in western Washington are comparatively limited, and the greatest reserves of this timber are {{along the line of}} the Lake Shore. I think it but {{a matter of a few}} years when the cedar will be exhausted on our other lines.|$|E
25|$|In the {{trenches}} of World War One, Johnson's name {{was used by}} British troops to describe the impact of German 150mm heavy artillery shells which had a black colour. In his letters home to his wife, Rupert Edward Inglis (1863–1916), a former rugby international who was a Forces Chaplain, describes passing through the town of Albert: We went through the place today (2 October 1915) where the Virgin Statue {{at the top of}} the Church was hit by a shell in January. The statue was knocked over, but has never fallen, I sent you a picture of it. It really is a wonderful sight. It is incomprehensible how it can have stayed there, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is now lower than when the photograph was taken, and no doubt will come down with the next gale. The Church and village are wrecked, there’s a huge hole made by a Jack Johnson just outside the west door of the Church.|$|E
6000|$|... "Decidedly. That's a risk, and it {{has entered}} into my calculation. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> appreciable, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> small, and I'm {{prepared}} to take it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... [Smiling.] Don't take it too seriously. It really doesn't matter. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> far wiser that we shouldn't see {{one another}} again.|$|R

500|$|Ten years ago, any fish {{getting as}} far down as Salford {{would have been}} killed almost {{immediately}} by the pollution in the water. [...] Although the river {{there is now a}} great deal better than it has been for 100 years, fish will probably not be able to live long. [...] These had probably got into the main river from small streams flowing into the Irwell. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is real progress.|$|E
500|$|When {{posed the}} film's central question, can {{men and women}} just be friends, Ryan replied, [...] "Yes, men and women can just be friends. I {{have a lot of}} platonic (male) friends, and sex doesn't get in the way." [...] Crystal said, [...] "I'm a little more optimistic than Harry. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is difficult. Men {{basically}} act like stray dogs in front of a supermarket. I do have platonic (women) friends, but not best, best, best friends." ...|$|E
500|$|Faulks {{stated that}} Devil May Care {{would be his}} only Bond book, saying: [...] "One tribute, one centenary, one book", adding [...] "My {{contract}} did offer me a second go, but definitely not... 'Once funny, twice silly, three times a slap', as the nanny saying goes. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> {{would be a good}} gig for someone to do." [...] He saw his novel as a continuation of the Fleming books, saying [...] "I tried to put the films out of mind", adding that [...] "I prepared in a rather pedantic way by reading all of the books in chronological order and when I got to the end I wrote mine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm human," [...] he laughed. [...] "Perhaps I'd better mention <b>it.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> more to {{the purpose}} to say that I'm {{altogether}} at your disposal." ...|$|R
500|$|Speaking to Creem {{magazine}} in 1977, Bowie proclaimed that Station to Station was [...] "devoid of spirit... Even the love songs are detached, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> fascinating." ...|$|R
6000|$|He found a knife, {{which he}} rubbed on the table-cloth. [...] "I used the {{thing on the}} indicator, the contraption in the box, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> clean enough." ...|$|R
500|$|... "We {{dared to}} hope we had invented {{something}} that would bring lasting peace to the earth. But we were wrong... No, I don't have any regrets about my part in {{the invention of the}} airplane, though no one could deplore more than I do the destruction it has caused. I feel about the airplane much the same as I do in regard to fire. That is, I regret all the terrible damage caused by fire, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is good for the human race that someone discovered how to start fires and that we have learned how to put fire to thousands of important uses." ...|$|E
500|$|According to Barrales, {{beyond the}} name, Bonded by Blood {{borrowed}} from Exodus for inspiration everything. [...] "From the guitars being razor-sharp to the drums, the speed. We {{wanted to do}} something that resemble that. Something that is gonna be fast and in-your-face. And what better band than Exodus to be inspired by?" [...] Exodus' lead guitarist Gary Holt says that is a compliment that the band has named themselves after Bonded by Blood. [...] "Could I have imagined that all these years later a band was going to name themselves after our first album? Probably not. It is not like that convention—naming bands after songs—is something new, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is great." ...|$|E
500|$|Åkerman {{attended}} {{many different}} schools, including Sir Winston Churchill Secondary School in St. Catharines, Ontario. She once attended a Catholic school, {{though she was}} raised as a Buddhist. She has recalled some portions of her childhood as [...] "painful", explaining that [...] "I loved my father very much and I only got to see him during the school holidays. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was an advantage that they split up when I was very young, so I could get used to it." [...] She visited her father in Falsterbo, Sweden, during school breaks and talked to him regularly over the phone. She cites her parents as [...] "supportive, positive influences" [...] in her life.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he got to}} Hawick, {{where we}} lost trace of him, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> {{impossible}} that he went farther north. Have you any ground for suspecting who brought him the warning?" ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, I {{like that}} way, too; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> better to baste it on with Valenciennes or bombazine, or {{something}} of that sort. It gives it such an air--and attracts so much noise.|$|R
6000|$|... "It might be. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> {{somebody}} who's crazy. A tramp wouldn't find it any fun to live away out here. Why, {{it must be}} two miles, at least, to {{the nearest}} farm." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{opposition}} grew in 1688 {{against the}} Catholic King James II, {{the military establishment}} around Portsmouth was controlled by the King's illegitimate son, James FitzJames, the Duke of Berwick. Revolution broke out and for a period Portsmouth and its defences were important to the King as a potential exit route for the Royal Family to France; by late December, however, this route was no longer needed. George Legge, the Baron Dartmouth, pressurised FitzJames to hand over control of Southsea Castle to the Protestant Captain Carter on 18 December and Portsmouth surrendered to the revolution two days later. The traveller Celia Fiennes, who visited the castle in 1690, observed that it was [...] "very fine, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is but of little strength and service." ...|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} his {{narrative}} of the Quest expedition, Wild wrote of the Antarctic: [...] "I think that my work there is done"; he never returned, closing a career which, like Shackleton's, had bracketed the entire Heroic Age. In 1923 he emigrated to South Africa where, after a series of business failures and dogged by ill health, he was employed in a succession of low-paid jobs. In March 1939 the British Government awarded him an annual pension of £170; Wild commented: [...] "I don't want to grumble, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> might have been made big enough for the poor old hero and his wife to live on". Wild died on 19 August 1939, aged 66, the cause of death recorded as pneumonia [...] and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
500|$|Marmarosa {{began his}} {{professional}} career around 1941, joining the Johnny [...] "Scat" [...] Davis orchestra {{at the age}} of 15 or 16. He was first mentioned in the national jazz press the following year, appearing in Down Beat magazine for his playing at a jam session. After touring, the Davis orchestra disbanded, so Marmarosa and others then joined Gene Krupa around the end of 1942. After one 1943 Krupa performance in Philadelphia, Marmarosa was beaten into a coma by sailors who accused him of draft dodging. According to clarinetist Buddy DeFranco, who was also attacked by the men, [...] "Dodo was always a little off but he seemed different after that beating. The head injury didn't affect his playing, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> created psychological problems for him." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “His camera glides through {{spaces in}} a way that just seems impossible... Sometimes you stop looking at the movie and look at the shot. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> delightful." [...] Robb Moss, film {{lecturer}} at Harvard.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, of course," [...] {{said the}} doctor. [...] "It's bad for him; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> slowly getting better. Yes, decidedly. It's very extraordinary, {{but ever since}} he's {{been in charge of}} the Miss Northwicks' interests--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] smiled Lance, [...] "experience helps; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> an instinct. Of course, {{if you do}} {{show signs}} of damage, you're done for, because then the people who envied you throw the biggest stones." ...|$|R
500|$|... 48 {{hours before}} the film got the {{official}} green light from Fox, the studio cut the film's budget by $7–8 million, down to $58 million. This forced a last minute re-write that saw about 9 pages cut from the previously 110 page script. Changes included the removal of a motorcycle chase {{at the end of}} the Twelve Bullets Fight, and having Deadpool forget his bag of guns before the final battle sequence to avoid having a costly gun fight in the third act. Reese said, [...] "It was that last, lean and mean chop that got us to a place where Fox was willing to make it. The script was very efficient and not too long. That was a function of budget more than anything, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> really made the movie pace nicely." ...|$|E
500|$|Fry and Dickinson flew to New York with promotional {{copies and}} met {{employees}} {{of a number}} of record labels, but could not generate interest in the album. When a similar promotion attempt failed in California, the album was shelved as it was considered not commercial enough for release. Fry recalled, [...] "We'd go in and play it and these guys would look at us like we were crazy". In late 1974, before the album was even named, the band broke up, bringing Big Star's first era to its end. Dickinson later said that he was [...] "nailed for indulging Alex on Big Star Third, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is important that the artist is enabled to perform with integrity. What I did for Alex was literally remove the yoke of oppressive production that he had been under since the first time he ever uttered a word into a microphone, for good or ill." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a two-month}} courtship, Jolie married actor Billy Bob Thornton on May 5, 2000, in Las Vegas. They had {{met on the}} set of Pushing Tin (1999), but did not pursue a {{relationship}} at that time as Thornton was engaged to actress Laura Dern, while Jolie was reportedly dating actor Timothy Hutton, her co-star in Playing God (1997). As a result of their frequent public declarations of passion and gestures of love—most famously wearing one another's blood in vials around their necks—their marriage became a favorite topic of the entertainment media. Jolie and Thornton announced the adoption of a child from Cambodia in March 2002, but abruptly separated three months later. Their divorce was finalized on May 27, 2003. When asked about the sudden dissolution of their marriage, Jolie stated, [...] "It took me by surprise, too, because overnight, we totally changed. I think one day we had just nothing in common. And it's scary <b>but...</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> can happen when you get involved and you don't know yourself yet." ...|$|E
60|$|BREFFITT. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a mistake--I <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a mistake, and I'm {{bound to}} say it, {{to let a}} great deal of trouble rise for a very small cause. The clerks might have had what they {{reasonably}} asked her.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the kind," [...] {{interrupted}} George Wright, loud-voiced. [...] "Cousin, go on {{with your}} dance. I'll take a couple of cowboys. I'll find this--this rustler, if there's one here. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> only another bluff of Steele's." ...|$|R

500|$|The {{overtaking}} manoeuvres made by Coulthard on Michael Schumacher {{received much}} media attention after the race. Coulthard accused Michael Schumacher of unsporting behaviour and dangerous driving, saying: [...] "I had a clean run at Michael {{on the outside}} and equally I felt he drove me wide. You could say he had the right to do that because he had the track position, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a deliberate gesture in trying to run someone wide like that and I was very angry." [...] Michael Schumacher later denied any wrongdoing and citied a similar incident at the 1999 Japanese Grand Prix where Coulthard pushed him wide although no objections were made. He also admitted that he did not see Coulthard's hand gesture. Coulthard sought clarification with the FIA over such overtakes with a source from Formula One's governing body noting: [...] "It was hard racing -- they are racing drivers aren't they?" [...] GrandPrix.com said that Coulthard's overtake meant that [...] "He is ready to stand up to Michael and he is not afraid of what will happen if Michael does not lift." ...|$|E
500|$|Daniel Montesinos-Donaghy of Den of Geek stated [...] "After the {{excellent}} pilot episode, 'Day One' {{is both a}} step forward and a step backward. As silly as {{the idea of a}} nymphomaniac extra-terrestrial gas is, the cast throw themselves into it with aplomb, quipping their way to the relatively gripping conclusion." [...] Patrick Holm of Total Sci-Fi felt that the second episode [...] "equates the word 'adult' with sex and swearing – more of a playground definition than a serious drama. In the conclusion of his review, Jonathan Capps of Noise to Signal felt that the episode was [...] "certainly nothing to get excited about, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> won't be too indicative of later episodes, as we're still getting to know these characters, and that has to take the fore in the first few episodes. However, Chris' [...] painfully simplistic, heavy-handed and often clichéd interpretation of sci-fi (some of Jack's techno-babble is frankly embarrassing) could prove to be a worrying factor later in the series." [...] A reviewer of TV Fodder felt [...] "Day One" [...] was a [...] "great second episode", adding [...] "there doesn't seem to be anything I don't like about this show".|$|E
500|$|I'm {{influenced}} by everything. By books, by the weather, by the water, by my shoes, if they're comfortable or not. Everything. One {{of it is}} music, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> is very important {{with people who are}} dealing with making music that they are not only {{influenced by}} music. And I find it very sad when you find a record, and it says on : [...] "this record was inspired by Miles Davis." [...] Because it's like making...a film, you don't make a film about a film, you make a film about real life. And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right. It should be beyond style, beyond influence, it should be about pure emotion, and real life.|$|E
6000|$|Phebe {{clapped her}} hands as she skipped {{off the bed and}} ran to the door, saying merrily, [...] "One of them is for your feet, anyway. I don't know what you'll say to the other, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> elegant." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And yet there's {{something}} out of the common, too," [...] he remarked. [...] "You see that bed? Well, I intend to sleep there to-night. I don't want to buck, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a bit of a test for nerve." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "Heart’s All Gone" [...] {{is one of}} the band's fastest songs, {{alongside}} [...] "Josie" [...] and [...] "The Party Song". [...] "It's really fast, <b>it's</b> real dark, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> just awesome. I'm totally {{proud of}} that song," [...] said Hoppus.|$|R
