It {{had been the}} legacy of the French King and its fusion with the formations of the French revolution and Napoleon's reforms had transformed it into a military machine that had dominated Europe since 1805.

25|$|Thucydides admired Pericles, {{approving}} of {{his power}} over the people and showing a marked distaste for the demagogues who followed him. He did not approve of the democratic commoners nor the radical democracy that Pericles ushered in but considered democracy acceptable when guided <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> leader. Thucydides's presentation of events is generally even-handed; for example, he does not minimize the negative effect of his own failure at Amphipolis. Occasionally, however, strong passions break through, as in his scathing appraisals of the democratic leaders Cleon and Hyperbolus. Cleon has sometimes been connected with Thucydides's exile.|$|E
25|$|As a {{conversation}} piece people have frequently asked me which of my many wickets {{has given me}} the most pleasure...I no longer stop to think. My answer does not concern one wicket but three. Those of Alan Turner and the Chappell brothers, Ian and Greg...I felt each one proved a point. That I was not over the hill as a Test fast bowler despite having been ignored for eight Test matches at home and two tours abroad. Each of these three batsman was well beaten <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> delivery, two out leg before and Ian Chappell caught behind. Down at leg after that opening spell I bloody nearly cried.|$|E

25|$|England’s bowlers {{worked hard}} {{throughout}} days 1 and 2, but {{were unable to}} replicate the successes they had previously achieved against India’s powerful batting line up. Dinesh Karthik continued his good form to score 91, and Rahul Dravid scored 55 before he was clean bowled <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> delivery from James Anderson. England’s cause was not helped by dropped catches from the wicketkeeper Matt Prior – first off Sachin Tendulkar {{when he was on}} 20, and then VVS Laxman when he was on 41. Tendulkar went on to make 82, and Laxman 51. Prior also conceded five lots of four byes on day 1, though some of these might conceivably have been signalled wide.|$|E
25|$|A major {{design flaw}} {{with the class}} was that the {{traction}} current circuits of each bogie were not isolated. The third rail supply is generated close to the rail line {{and there are many}} areas where it changes from one substation to another. Although great effort is made to ensure the voltages are the same between sections, at the extreme ends of supply there can be very large differences due mainly to voltage drops caused by other electric trains. There are examples of fires in class 73 where the locomotive has acted as an electrical bridge between two different substations causing the traction circuit inside the locomotive to take the brunt of the huge surges in supply as trains move {{in and out of the}} sections behind and in front. This problem was particularly noticeable at junctions where conductor rails cannot be separated <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> distance and many of the class were damaged by fire caused in this manner over the years. Class 73s were well known for incredible displays of arcing at the collector shoes for this exact reason.|$|E
25|$|This {{bibliography}} of George Washington {{is a comprehensive}} list of written and published works about George Washington, first President of the United States, his life in general or in part and includes primary sources containing Washington's works, letters, records, diaries, etc. The literature on Washington is immense, his biographers and editors having lived in four separate centuries. Many of the publications listed here lend themselves to Washington in a biographical capacity, while many cover specific events and other topics where Washington is the central or an important figure. Publications covering subjects such as 'The Winter at Valley Forge', 'The Battle of Brooklyn' and Washington's farewell address are well placed {{and can be found}} in this bibliography. Washington was diligent about keeping records, maintained many dairies throughout his adult life, and corresponded with many prominent figures, family members and friends. At this late date nearly all of Washington's writings have been studied, transcribed, organized, edited and published <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> number of historians over the years, providing the basis by which the many biographical accounts of Washington's life have been written.|$|E

25|$|Cleveland {{lost its}} {{first game of}} the season and was shut {{out for the first time}} in 62 games against the Giants in Cleveland. Unlike the Eagles, the Giants {{prepared}} carefully for the Browns and were able to stop the team's potent passing attack. After the Browns beat Philadelphia, Giants coach Steve Owen scouted the team and resolved to use an innovative umbrella defense, a formation where the defensive ends were used to cover passes. This freed the team's linebackers and safeties to cover passes over the middle of the field. The Giants advanced 52 yards on a drive in the first quarter, ending with a touchdown run by Eddie Price. The extra point attempt failed, but the six points were enough to win the game as New York's defensive strategy paid dividends. Graham had no completions in the first half and threw four interceptions. Cleveland had several opportunities to score late in the game, including a drive set up <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> punt return by Dom Moselle that ended with a fumble. Graham also missed on passes to Speedie and Horace Gillom in the end zone in the fourth quarter.|$|E

500|$|Despite Vanderbilt's strong record, the Sewanee Tigers were undefeated {{and felt}} cause for {{optimism}} in the effective Southern championship. One account recalls: [...] "A high authority on foot-ball {{said the other}} day: Vanderbilt is not invincible, <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal. The Sewanee [...] "Tigers" [...] are going to Nashville on Thursday to prove that fact." [...] Vanderbilt struggled, but still won 20–0. [...] "With Vandy making only 20 points–Vandy was stale, was the explanation." [...] After the big win over Carlisle, [...] "a matter-of-course feeling pervaded the entire game." [...] The first score of the game came on a 25-yard field goal. The first touchdown came from Owsley Manier. In the second half, Bob Blake made a 22-yard field goal, and Manier got another touchdown.|$|E

500|$|Small Heath fielded {{eight of}} their regular {{starting}} eleven {{in a friendly}} against First Division Nottingham Forest. A close and exciting game, which featured [...] "both goal-keepers displaying wonderful cleverness and resource", was won by Forest with a late goal. In their first competitive fixture of the month, the quarter-final of the Birmingham Cup, they beat Wednesbury Old Athletic, a team from the Birmingham & District League, by five goals to nil in a match [...] "characterised <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal of rough play". A [...] "fairly strong" [...] team suffered a rare home defeat in a friendly against Middlesbrough of the Northern League. Jack Hallam appeared to score in the first half, but the referee disallowed the goal, having spotted that Hallam had knocked the ball in with hand rather than head, and Middlesbrough went on to score twice without reply in the second period.|$|E
500|$|Lev Grossman and Peter Ha ranked ODST as {{the eighth}} best {{game of the}} year for Time, lauding the game as [...] "a dark, slow, jazzy, hard-boiled take on the Halo world". Softpedia branded ODST the best first-person shooter of the year; games editor Andrei Dumitrescu wrote that while the game {{occasionally}} felt formulaic, it was bolstered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> plot, great music, and supporting characters that players could care about. Chris Kohler from Wired ranked ODST as the third best Xbox 360 title of the year, writing that the game [...] "injected a fresh breath into the staid corridors of Bungie's shooter franchise". Halo 3: ODST also won [...] "Best Original Score" [...] at the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards.

No one would argue that there's a huge amount more than meets the eye (or ear) there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second-rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Mark Richardson opines that [...] "the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered" [...] and describes [...] "Hey Bulldog" [...] as [...] "a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, [...] <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> margin the best song here". Richardson concludes: [...] "But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which is something the Beatles so rarely were otherwise." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{two outs}} and Ruth at first base, left fielder Bob Meusel {{came up to}} the plate, with Lou Gehrig waiting in the batting circle after him. Meusel was a [...]315 hitter that year and had batted in 81runs in just over 100 regular-season games. Meusel also had success in Game6 against Alexander, with a double and triple. Just as Meusel was about to take his first pitch, Ruth made the bold move of trying to steal second base. Ruth was known as a good but overly {{aggressive}} baserunner, with about a 50% success rate at stealing bases in his career, and his attempt surprised many people throughout the stadium. Meusel swung and missed at the pitch, and Cardinals catcher Bob O'Farrell immediately threw the ball to second baseman Hornsby. Hornsby reached for the ball, and laid the tag immediately on Ruth. Ruth was out <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> , and the game was over. As the game announcer described it, [...] "Ruth is walked again for the fourth time today. One strike on Bob Meusel.

[...] By the time they passed below Barnes Bridge, Cambridge were seven seconds ahead. [...] They passed the finishing post with a lead of two and a quarter lengths in a time of 20 minutes 57 seconds, taking the overall record in the event to 4440 in their favour. [...] It was the Light Blues' tenth consecutive victory, a record streak {{in the history of the}} event. [...] It was the slowest winning time since the 1925 race and the narrowest margin of victory since the 1930 race. [...] Writing in The Observer, William Beach Thomas declared that [...] "a good crew was beaten <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> crew after one of the finest races in the long chronicles". [...] According to the former Oxford rower E.P.Evans, [...] "the features of the race were the superb stroking of the Oxford crew by Holdsworth and the extremely bad coxing of the Cambridge boat ... although Cambridge won, they were not really at their best." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{aggregate}} site Metacritic, Pandora's Tower {{received a}} score of 73/100 based on 48 critic reviews, denoting [...] "mixed or average" [...] reception. Destructoid's Tony Ponce praised the game's premise and how fleshed out Elena was despite {{her role as a}} damsel in distress, but felt that there was too much background lore, and that Aeron's lack of personality hurt the relationship aspect. Andrew Fitch, writing for Electronic Gaming Monthly, praised the world design, but faulted the lack of character development given to Aeron and Elena. Eurogamer's Matt Edwards referred to the game's plot as [...] "a soppy and yet surprisingly sinister love story", saying that moments between the couple raised a genuine smile. IGN's Chris Schilling said that while the story was [...] "slight", it was bolstered <b>by</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> localization and voice acting, in addition to darker elements in the plot and during cutscenes. GameSpot's Ashton Raze praised Aeron and Elena's romance as [...] "a grounded, human [...] in a world of monsters". Heidi Kemps, writing for Joystiq, noted genuine emotion in the relationship mechanics of Aeron and Elema, while Steve Hogarty of Official Nintendo Magazine referred to the scenario as [...] "a boy-meets-girl love story with a Clive Barker twist" [...] in addition to praising its dark tone. The game's time limit mechanic and its impact on Elena's condition divided opinion: some praised its implementation, but some critics noted that it might put too much pressure on the player.|$|E
