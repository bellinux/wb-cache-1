It has broken through the limitation of current social <b>benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> on land consolidation, which can only carry out qualitative assessment. Social security of land consolidation includes three aspects of the old-age security, medical security and unemployment security. Functional values of social security, such as the old-age security, medical security and unemployment security, for three types of population (basic population, dependent population and maintenance population) are calculated according to the effective area and original production of arable land. Research result shows that the implementation of land consolidation has brought substantial social benefits. The value of old-age security is still the core, meanwhile the functions of medical security and unemployment security {{become more and more}} significant.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new framework {{for measuring the}} benefits of IT in construction. The framework {{is based on the}} principle that benefits realisation must be managed by: planning for strategic alignment and business-driven exploitation, managing the process of predicting benefits, and by measuring resulting benefits after a system or innovation is implemented. Three distinct types of benefits are identified within the new framework associated with business efficiency, business effectiveness and business performance. A key barrier to the more effective exploitation and application of IT in the construction sector has been the lack of investment on a scale comparable with other sectors. A primary reason cited for the low level of investment is the low level of perceived benefits from IT investments amongst construction business managers. Many <b>benefits</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods exist and are widely applied in other sectors. <b>Benefits</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods in construction are under-utilised. One reason for this is the lack of fit between these methods, and their associated language, with the peculiarities of the construction sector.

The framework has been subjected to testing and application within UK construction organisations. The results of this testing suggest a number of improvements in the benefits realisation proces...|$|R

40|$|The {{business}} {{benefits of}} IT projects are becoming the main determining factor in selecting projects at the ex-ante justification stage. The core stakeholders, i. e. the business management and IT professionals {{are charged with}} the task of evaluating the benefits of IT investment. Despite high adoption rates of formal IT investment appraisal methods, there is still on-going evidence that show organisations not being able to appropriately evaluate IT benefits. This study investigates the process of IT project evaluation at the ex-ante justification stage to understand factors that contribute to ineffective practical application of evaluation and based on the findings, to explore how these factors can be redeemed to improve the <b>benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> process. A case study research was conducted to explore how benefits can be evaluated appropriately within its context in a tertiary educational institution. The case study research approach enabled the researcher to gain a complete and in-depth understanding of the process and activities involved to identify and measure benefits at the justification stage. Business middle managers that are involved and responsible for IT project justification were approached from various business units as case study participants. Interview questions addressed various aspects of the benefits evaluation process in reference to participants’ experience and past IT project justifications. Content analysis was used to identify frequencies and intensities with which themes and concepts appear in interviewee responses. In addition, a cause and effect relationship tool was used to summarize the research findings for better data analysis and interpretation. The findings indicate factors that contributed to ineffective <b>benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> in the organization. Close collaboration and partnership between business management and IT professionals is shown to be a crucial component of the justification process. The suggested role of IT management exceeds beyond the task of technical advisor and involves the task of being a coach, informer, educator, assessor, transparency and communication agent. The results also show how best the measurement process can be performed at this stage. This study confirms that business management’s clear understanding of IT benefit concepts is necessary in the evaluation process. Based on the findings, an IT <b>benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> method is developed as a modification of the current justification process in the organisation.

40|$|Reasonable {{distribution}} network planning {{is an essential}} prerequisite of the economics and security of the future power grid. The comprehensive <b>benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> of a {{distribution network}} planning project can make significant contributions towards guiding decisions during the planning scheme, the optimization of the distribution network structure, and the rational use of resources. In this paper, {{in light of the}} characteristics of the power distribution network, the comprehensive <b>benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> index system is constructed considering the influencing factors of technical benefit, economic benefit, and social benefit. To eliminate the influence of subjective factors on the evaluation effects and the uncertainty of the influencing factors effectively, the improved interval analytic hierarchy process is employed to calculate the index weights more simply. Moreover, based on the traditional single-factor extension evaluation, this study proposes a multi-level extension assessment model to evaluate the comprehensive benefit of the power distribution network planning project. The model can not only identify the key factors that affect the evaluation effect of the power distribution network planning project, but also can predict the overall development trend of the project. Finally, using a specific urban distribution network planning project as an example, the findings indicate that the comprehensive benefit grade of this power distribution network planning project is “better” due to the benefit grade variable eigenvalue j * ∈ [3. 33, 3. 418] ∈ [3, 4], and illustrates that the model is credible and practical to achieve the comprehensive <b>benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> of the power distribution network planning project...|$|E

By modeling the microstructure of agglomeration economies, we derive second-best <b>benefit</b> <b>evaluation</b> formulae for urban transportation improvements. Previous work has investigated the same problem, but without explicitly modeling the sources of agglomeration economies. Accordingly, our analysis examines whether earlier results remain valid when monopolistic competition with differentiated products provides the microfoundation of the agglomeration economies.
