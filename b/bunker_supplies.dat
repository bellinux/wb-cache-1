50|$|As a {{countermeasure}} against rising oil costs MOL built energy-efficient ships, {{cooperating with}} Mitsui Engineering & Shipbuilding. Awobasan Maru, delivered in 1981, {{was the first}} ship incorporating innovations that reduced fuel consumption by 30%. In 1974 MOL established the Saudi Arabian Shipping Co., Ltd. (SASCO) and Arabian Marine Operation Co. Ltd. (AMOCO) as joint ventures with the prince of Saudi Arabia in Jeddah. SASCO is the shipowner, while AMOCO manages tanker operations. MOL hoped that this joint venture would give it an advantageous status in any future nationalization of oil, but at first the performance of these companies was not good, and AMOCO acquired the rights to <b>bunker</b> <b>supply</b> in 1977. Two years later the second oil crisis occurred and MOL {{was able to get}} a stable <b>bunker</b> <b>supply.</b>|$|R

50|$|A single RR 19C class, no. 336, {{was built}} by Henschel in 1953 as a {{condensing}} locomotive. After a collision in 1956, it was rebuilt into a non-condensing 19th Class and re-entered service in 1958.

He did not want any problem that can affect adversely his retirement. The call in Singapore could give the crew an extra income as per formula: to by in foreign country and to trade in the USSR.|$|R

50|$|According to the {{reparation}} programm-agreement, {{the ship}} {{was transferred to the}} Soviet Union in March 1946.

40|$|Recent developments, {{such as the}} OW Bunker {{litigation}} and the furore surrounding the Australian decision in the Sam Hawk, have made it particularly necessary to re-examine the tenuous relationships and terms which underpin bunker transactions. This thesis is concerned with one aspect which has caused particular concern for suppliers and shipowners; {{the ability of the}} supplier to access security in the vessel by way of a US choice of law clause when the time charterer has failed to pay for the bunkers. To put it more precisely, the research question to be addressed is the following; how effective is a choice of US law in a <b>bunker</b> <b>supply</b> contract between the supplier and time charterer for the supplier’s ability to access a maritime lien over the vessel? In answering this question, this thesis will also step back and consider whether these clauses could be made more effective and evaluate whether necessaries liens in general are the most practicable mechanism for the supplier to secure payment...|$|R

5000|$|In 1944 {{the town}} of Maisy {{was the site of}} a German heavy {{artillery}} battery and the headquarters for the sector. Until recently, the site was overgrown and had been covered by US engineers before the end of 1944 - well before any historians had a chance to examine the site. British military historian Gary Sterne rediscovered the site after finding [...] an American invasion map, and has purchased the site {{and turned it into a}} museum with over 2 miles of original German trenches and bunkers. From his research and newly released (previously top secret) papers, it is obvious that the site is many times larger than was originally thought. The labyrinth of trenches and tunnels had remained hidden for around 60 years. It contains office <b>bunkers,</b> <b>supplies</b> buildings, general quarters, radio rooms, and many other blocks, including an underground hospital (one of three which has been uncovered and can be visited).|$|R

50|$|Departing the Philippines on 12 September, {{the ship}} began her second amphibious assault, Operation Deckhouse IV, on 15 September 1966 in the {{vicinity}} of the Cua Viet River in Quảng Trị Province just south of the DMZ. The landings constituted a seaward arm of the larger Operation Prairie being conducted by American and South Vietnamese forces ashore to destroy North Vietnamese Army fortifications, <b>bunkers,</b> and <b>supply</b> caches in the area and to stem intensified infiltration across the DMZ. During their ten days ashore, the Marines of the SLF encountered heavy resistance and accounted for 254 of the enemy killed before they reembarked on 25 September.

In about 1965 a [...] "merry-go-round" [...] system of automatic coal wagon unloading was installed to evaluate for future [...] "Stations Systems". <b>Bunker</b> coal <b>supply</b> ran from the coal plant on inclined conveyors to the boiler house, where it was fed onto a moving [...] "feed head" [...] conveyor above the individual boiler coal bunkers. The plant burnt around 10,000 tonnes of coal a day. The two chimneys were 450 ft high. A pipeline was built to take ash across the Trent five miles to former gravel pits at Besthorpe, Nottinghamshire.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} decade, {{the demand for}} oil grew {{throughout}} the industrialised world, and BTC expanded its fleet accordingly. By 1924 the fleet numbered 60 vessels. The 60th ship was the new flagship, the 6,998 grt British Aviator. She was the BTC's first diesel engined oil tanker, and {{was at that time}} the most powerful single-screw motor ship in the world. A significant event was the signing of a contract with P&O in 1923 to <b>supply</b> <b>bunkering</b> facilities for the latter's ships.|$|R
5|$|New Jersey took up station off Tiger Island 1 October {{and fired}} at targets {{north of the}} DMZ before moving south that {{afternoon}} to engage Viet Cong targets. She accounted for six <b>bunkers,</b> a <b>supply</b> truck and an anti-aircraft site that day; additionally, she helped rescue the crew of a Marine spotting plane forced down at sea by anti-aircraft fire. On 3 October New Jersey fired on targets south of Tiger Island, and on 4 October the battleship fired on a Communist troop concentration and destroyed several bunkers. On the evening of 7 October New Jersey received reports {{that a number of}} waterborne logistics craft were moving south near the mouth of the Song Giang River. New Jersey responded by closing on the formation, and succeeded in sinking eleven of the craft before they could beach.|$|R
