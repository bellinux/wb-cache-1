5|$|Based on the {{analysis}} of rat and human urine by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, mephedrone {{is thought to be}} metabolised by three phase 1 pathways. It can be demethylated to the primary amine (producing compounds 2, 3 and 5), the ketone group can be reduced (producing 3) or the tolyl group can be oxidised (producing 6). Both 5 and 6 are thought to be further metabolised by conjugation to the glucuronide and sulfate derivatives. Knowledge of the primary routes of metabolism should allow the intake of mephedrone to be confirmed <b>by</b> <b>drug</b> tests, as well as more accurate determination of the causes of side effects and potential for toxicity.|$|E

5|$|He won the 100m at the Commonwealth Games {{trials in}} a season's best of 10.03s, then equalled Linford Christie's record of 10.04s at European Cup, where {{he led the}} British team to victory as team captain. Victories over Maurice Greene {{followed}} at Oslo's IAAF Golden League meeting and in Sheffield with a wind-assisted 9.95s. He was the favourite for the 2002 Commonwealth Games, but Chambers faced stiff competition from British newcomer Mark Lewis-Francis who was finishing fractions of a second behind him. Chambers won all his preliminary races and reached the final, along with Lewis-Francis and Jason Gardener, but he suffered a cramp mid-race {{and ended up in}} last place. He later revealed that he had feigned injury as the brief hamstring cramp was caused <b>by</b> <b>drug</b> abuse. The English sprinters had the three slowest times in the final, with Lewis-Francis also beset by injury.|$|E
5|$|In 1993 Christensen was arrested, tried, {{and sentenced}} to five years, four months {{imprisonment}} for trafficking marijuana and heroin. She claimed {{that she had been}} driving a car from Texas to Florida as a favor to friends, and had no knowledge that she was being used as a drug mule by them. Many Odinists and Asastruer decried the sentence, and claimed that it was a political frame-up; Murray established a Free Else Christensen Committee and with Stephen McNallen created a defense fund to aid her. Christensen herself did not endorse the claim that the charges were politically motivated, instead blaming her own naivete at being exploited <b>by</b> <b>drug</b> dealers. Before being imprisoned she gave the Odinist Fellowship's membership list to McNallen for the use of his own Heathen organisation, the Asatru Folk Assembly.|$|E
5|$|This {{alphabetical}} list contains notable {{people whose}} deaths can be reliably sourced {{to be the}} result of drug overdose or acute drug intoxication. Where sources indicate drug overdose or intoxication was only suspected to be the cause of death, this will specified in the 'notes' column. Where sources are able to indicate, deaths are specified as 'suicide', 'accidental', 'undetermined', or otherwise in the 'cause' column. Where sources do not explicitly state intent, they will be listed in this column as 'unknown'. Deaths from accidents or misadventure caused <b>by</b> <b>drug</b> overdoses or intoxication are also included on this list. Deaths from long-term effects of drugs, such as tobacco-related cancers and cirrhosis from alcohol, are not included, nor are deaths from lethal injection or euthanasia.|$|E

5|$|Derek Charles (Idris Elba) {{works for}} a finance company and is married to Sharon (Beyoncé). While Derek is at work, he greets {{temporary}} worker Lisa Sheridan (Ali Larter), who, believing Derek was flirting with her, attempts to seduce him throughout the film. Derek repeatedly rejects her, but Lisa continues to pursue him, making sexual advances on him at the Christmas party {{and at one point}} she follows him to his car in the parking garage and attempts to seduce him with revealing lingerie and fishnet stockings but Derek refuses again and forces her out of his car. Derek intends to report Lisa to his firm's human resource management, but learns that she has quit her job. Thinking that Lisa has given up, Derek is annoyed when he receives flirtatious emails from her. Derek and his workmates visit a resort for a conference, where he spots and confronts Lisa, who spikes his drink. Incapacitated, Derek is helpless when Lisa follows him into his hotel room. He confronts Lisa again the following day, and hours later discovers her lying naked in his bed after attempting suicide <b>by</b> <b>drug</b> overdose, and calls for medical help.|$|E
5|$|Her next {{role was}} as Natasha Rostova in the 1956 film {{adaptation}} of Leo Tolstoy's War and Peace. In 1957 Hepburn starred with Gary Cooper and Maurice Chevalier in Billy Wilder's Love in the Afternoon, and with Fred Astaire {{in the musical}} film Funny Face. Two years later she appeared in the romantic adventure film Green Mansions, and played a nun in The Nun's Story. In 1961, Hepburn played café society girl Holly Golightly in the romantic comedy Breakfast at Tiffany's, and as a teacher accused of lesbianism in Wyler's drama The Children's Hour opposite Shirley MacLaine. Two years later she appeared opposite Cary Grant in the romantic mystery film Charade. Hepburn followed this by starring in the romantic comedy Paris When It Sizzles opposite William Holden, and as Cockney flower girl Eliza Doolittle in the musical film My Fair Lady (both in 1964). In 1967, she played a blind woman menaced <b>by</b> <b>drug</b> dealers {{in her own home}} in the suspense thriller Wait Until Dark which earned her a Best Actress Oscar nomination. Nine years later, Hepburn played Maid Marian opposite Sean Connery as Robin Hood in Robin and Marian.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, palpitations, dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting <b>by</b> <b>drug</b> users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E

40|$|Gene {{expression}} is perturbated <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> to different extent. Analyzing genes whose {{expression is}} frequently regulated <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> {{would be useful}} for the screening of candidate therapeutic targets and genes implicated in side effect. Here, we obtained the differential expression number (DEN) for genes profiled in Affymetrix microarrays from the Connectivity Map project, and conducted systemic comparative computational analysis between high DEN genes and other genes. Results indicated that genes with higher down-/up-regulation number (down_h/up_h) tended to be clustered in genome, and have lower homologous gene number, higher SNP density and more disease-related SNP. Down_h and up_h were significantly enriched in cancer related pathways, while genes with lower down-/up-regulation number (down_l/up_l) were mainly involved {{in the development of}} nervous system diseases. Besides, up_h had lower interaction network degree, later developmental stage to express, higher tissue expression specificity than up_l, while down_h showed reversed tendency in comparison with down_l. Together, our analysis suggests that genes frequently regulated <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> {{are more likely to be}} associated with disease-related functions, but the extensive activation of conserved and widely expressed genes <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> is disfavored...|$|R

50|$|A {{major goal}} of {{epilepsy}} {{research is the}} identification of therapies to interrupt or reverse epileptogenesis. Studies largely in animal models have suggested {{a wide variety of}} possible antiepileptogenic strategies although, to date, no such therapy has been demonstrated to be antiepileptogenic in clinical trials. Some anticonvulsant drugs, including levetiracetam and ethosuximide have shown promising activity in animal models. Other promising strategies are inhibition of interleukin 1β signaling <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> such as VX-765; modulation of sphingosine 1-phosphate signaling <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> such as fingolimod; activation of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) <b>by</b> <b>drugs</b> such as rapamycin; the hormone erythropoietin; and, paradoxically, drugs such as the α2 adrenergic receptor antagonist atipamezole and the CB1 cannabinoid antagonist SR141716A (rimonabant) with proexcitatory activity.|$|R
