By 1964 he had become head of the Indonesian Army's history division, holding an honorary rank. Continuing to teach, he wrote extensively on the revolution and other military events, including the first <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 30 September Movement of 1965.

5|$|After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine {{abandoned}} his {{design for a}} freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.|$|E
5|$|After the Court of Appeal of England and Wales {{ruled in}} his favour, {{the book was}} made {{available}} in the UK.

In September 2008, MI6 ended all legal objection to the publication of The Big Breach, released the proceeds from the publication to Tomlinson, and admitted that the organisation's previous legal actions against him were disproportionate. However, it still refused to reinstate him or compensate him {{for the loss of}} his career and pension. Since 2009, Tomlinson can now travel freely to the UK.|$|E

5|$|Clara {{explored}} eastern religions for a {{few years}} and then eventually became a Christian Scientist, although there is some question as to her seriousness and commitment to it. She authored a <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject: Awake to a Perfect Day, published by Citadel Press, NYC, 1956 After originally objecting to the release of her father's Letters from the Earth in 1939, she changed her stance shortly before her death in 1962 and allowed them to be published. She also published biographies of both her father (My Father, Mark Twain in 1931) and of her first husband (My Husband: Gabrilowitsch in 1938).|$|E
5|$|Cook's {{education}} {{includes a}} background in physics. Prior to {{his work on the}} book, Cook founded the website Skeptical Science, which compiles peer-reviewed evidence of climate change. He placed on the site the most common assertions made by individuals arguing against the scientific consensus for climate change, with evidence to refute each point they made. After the publication of Climate Change Denial: Heads in the Sand, Cook coauthored another <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject, Climate Change Science: A Modern Synthesis: Volume 1– The Physical Climate (2013). In 2015, Cook served as the climate communication fellow at the University of Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Darwin {{published}} {{his theory of}} evolution with compelling evidence in his 1859 <b>book</b> <b>On</b> <b>the</b> Origin of Species, overcoming scientific rejection of earlier concepts of transmutation of species. By the 1870s, the scientific community {{and much of the}} general public had accepted evolution as a fact. However, many favoured competing explanations and {{it was not until the}} emergence of the modern evolutionary synthesis from the 1930s to the 1950s that a broad consensus developed in which natural selection was the basic mechanism of evolution. Darwin's scientific discovery is the unifying theory of the life sciences, explaining the diversity of life.|$|E

5|$|Domitian was {{allegedly}} extremely sensitive regarding his baldness, which he disguised {{in later life}} by wearing wigs. According to Suetonius, he even wrote a <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> subject of hair care. With regard to Domitian's personality, however, the account of Suetonius alternates sharply between portraying Domitian as the emperor-tyrant, a man both physically and intellectually lazy, and the intelligent, refined personality drawn elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|During the mid-to-late 1960s Notosusanto wrote {{extensively}} on the military history of Indonesia, including a book on Supriyadi's anti-Japanese rebellion in 1945 and the Battle of Surabaya. His 1968 <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> 30 September Movement coup in 1965, written in collaboration with Ismail Saleh and entitled The Coup Attempt of the 30 September Movement in Indonesia, was the first on the subject to be published.

5|$|Everyone in {{the office}} {{complains}} about Dwight Schrute's (Rainn Wilson) building standards, such as un-plying toilet paper, adding motion sensors to the lights, and placing a roach billboard over the windows to the office. Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), as office administrator, threatens to move everyone to a different building if nothing is done. She leaves and comes back with pictures of a newer office space and says they can move in three months. Dwight investigates and finds that the office building does not exist. When Dwight plays coy around Pam, she admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that she lied about the office building and that she is afraid of failing again after failing {{as an artist and}} a salesperson. Jim tries in vain to reassure her, and she breaks down in tears. Later Nate (Mark Proksch), Dwight's building assistant, discreetly gives Pam a <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> state building regulations. Pam shows Dwight that his policies are in violation of the laws written in the book, so Dwight puts everything back to normal. The camera crew confronts Dwight with footage showing that he overheard Pam's conversation with Jim and instructed Nate to give her the <b>book</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> building regulations. Dwight admits that he allowed her to win, but mocks the idea that he did so out of compassion.|$|E
