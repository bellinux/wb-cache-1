500|$|... "Immortality" [...] {{was written}} by co-executive {{producer}} David Wilcox and story editor Ethan Gross, and was directed by frequent Fringe collaborator Brad Anderson. Around the time the episode aired, executive producer and showrunner J.H. Wyman said of Anderson, [...] "If {{we come up with}} this great concept and say, 'That's going to be tricky to shoot,' we know he's going to transcend it <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> has that way of looking at film as a feature director where anything's possible." [...] Wyman and fellow executive producer and showrunner Jeff Pinkner planned the Fauxlivia pregnancy storyline since they conceived her character; according to them, they departed from the typical television pregnancy trope by [...] "Fringe-if it" [...] and adding a science fiction element.|$|E
500|$|Commentator and Simpson's {{close friend}} David Saunders stated in his 1971 book, Cycling in the Sixties, that {{although}} he did not condone Simpson's use of drugs, he thought it was not the reason for his death. He said: [...] "I am quite convinced that Simpson killed himself <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> did not know when to stop. All his racing life he had punished his frail body, pushing it to the limits of endurance with his tremendous will-power and single-mindedness and, on Mont Ventoux, he pushed it too far, perhaps the drug easing the pain of it all." [...] Saunders {{went on to say that}} Simpson was not alone in the taking of drugs in professional cycling and that the authorities ignored their use. His opinion was that Simpson did not take drugs to gain an unfair advantage, but because [...] "he was not going to be beaten by a pill".|$|E
500|$|Cleveland {{reached the}} {{championship}} game in the following three seasons but lost each time, once to the Rams and twice to the Detroit Lions. Gillom led the NFL in punting in 1951, with a 45.5-yard average. He again led the league the following season, averaging 45.7 yards per punt, and was selected for the Pro Bowl, football's all-star game. Gillom was second in the NFL in punting average in 1953. During his years with the Browns, Gillom's long, high punts and his habit of standing further back from center than was usual set a precedent followed by many of his successors at the position. His kicks had a long hang time, which allowed teammates to get further downfield to defend the punt return. [...] "We didn't just go back 40 yards, we went back 50, 60 yards <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> kicked it so damn far and so high", Otto Schnellbacher, who played against the Browns with the Yankees and Giants, later said. Gillom's positioning behind the center gave him more space to kick but also put more distance {{between him and the}} opposing linemen, reducing the likelihood of a block.|$|E
5000|$|Awfully Wee Billy Bigchin: He {{came with}} Jeannie from the Long Lake clan {{and is the}} new gonnagle for Chalk clan. He is notably smaller {{than many of the}} other Feegles, partly <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> young and partly <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> short. When Miss Level remarks how short he is in A Hat Full of Sky, he replies, [...] "Only fra my height, Mistress." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why!" [...] {{said the}} tinker. [...] "Well {{this is a}} blasted {{innocent}} country! Why! <b>Because</b> <b>'E's</b> blind! Wot else? (Carm on--Dam yer). <b>Because</b> <b>'E's</b> <b>just</b> as full as 'E can 'old. That's why!" ...|$|R
5000|$|And one of {{the reasons}} we signed Briggs to the Golden Era label was... <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> got this presence. You know, he's everywhere. He's {{probably}} the hardest-working individual in Australian hip-hop, if not one of. He's the most self-motivated dude I've ever met ... everywhere he goes, you know, everyone remembers Briggs.|$|R
2500|$|Frederick {{described}} {{his account of}} the litigation: [...] "Erhard sent seven lawyers to the courtroom; I had one. They argued I was taking illegal liberty with the most incredible educational system in existence, and that I must be stopped immediately. The judge must have thought that we were arguing over some might trivial scribblings, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> looked up quizzingly over his Franklin specs and threw the whole case right out the door." [...] Erhard filed three lawsuits against Frederick, claiming copyright infringement. All of est/Erhard's suits were ruled 'nuisance claims'and summarily [...] "thrown out of court" [...] in 1976.|$|E
2500|$|Dallas {{reporter}} Tony Zoppi, {{who knew}} Ruby well, claimed that one [...] "would {{have to be}} crazy" [...] to entrust Ruby with anything as important as a high-level plot to kill Kennedy since he [...] "couldn't keep a secret for five minutesâ€¦ Jack {{was one of the}} most talkative guys you would ever meet. He'd be the worst fellow in the world to be part of a conspiracy, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> plain talked too much." [...] He and others described Ruby as the sort who enjoyed being at [...] "the center of attention", trying to make friends with people and being more of a nuisance.|$|E
2500|$|At the [...] "Develop" [...] {{conference in}} July 2012, Perry {{released}} a statement that he's {{sure there will be}} another Earthworm Jim game. He claimed the problem was [...] "when", not [...] "if", as, while the development team members discuss the project actively, they are all busy with their separate projects and companies. A possible premise he outlined was, [...] "The thing we had talked about in the past is Jim had been in retirement...So, he's been sitting at home watching movies and eating popcorn. He's grossly overweight now. The plan was to start with him literally getting off the sofa, and it's a disaster <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> hasn't done anything since. But he's got to get back into action again." [...] While details regarding just how much Jim being out of shape would affect game design are still up in the air, Perry mentioned being pretty certain that the game would be played in 2D.|$|E
5000|$|Six months later, {{the band}} {{released}} its self-produced follow-up, 1000 Days, on Drag City. Prior to the album's recording and release, guitarist Daniel Martens temporarily {{stepped down from}} the band, with bass guitarist Lee Landey stating: [...] "He's not touring with us this time <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> had a baby." [...] The band was subsequently referred to as a three-piece, with Martens remaining absent from press photographs.|$|R
50|$|In 2009, Montgomery {{turned down}} an offer to become the {{scouting}} director of the San Diego Padres <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> moved to Connecticut and didn't want to relocate.|$|R
5000|$|Goldman says John Schlesinger only {{agreed to}} do the film <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> {{finished}} The Day of the Locust and was [...] "terrified he was dead in Hollywood." ...|$|R
60|$|Mr. Direck's broken wrist healed {{sooner than}} he desired. From the {{first he had}} protested {{that it was the}} sort of thing that one can carry about in a sling, that he was quite capable of {{travelling}} about and taking care of himself in hotels, that he was only staying on at Matching's Easy <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> loved to stay on and wallow in Mrs. Britling's kindness and Mr. Britling's company. While as a matter of fact he wallowed as much as he could in the freshness and friendliness of Miss Cecily Corner, and for more than a third of this period Mr. Britling was away from home altogether.|$|E
60|$|You see, Happy Jack was {{spying on}} Striped Chipmunk. Yes, Sir, Happy Jack was spying. Spying, you know, is {{secretly}} watching {{other people and}} {{trying to find out what}} they are doing. It isn't a nice thing to do, not a bit nice. Happy Jack knew it, and all the time he was doing it, he was feeling very much ashamed of himself. But he said to himself that he just had to know where Striped Chipmunk's storehouse was, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> had to peep inside and find out if it held any of the big, fat hickory nuts that had disappeared from under the tall hickory tree while he was quarreling up in the top of it with his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{suppose you}} wonder what I'm doing at Prospect Point. Well, I always like to spend a month of summer at the shore, and father insists that I come to his second-cousin Emily's 'select boardinghouse' at Prospect Point. So a {{fortnight}} ago I came as usual. And as usual old 'Uncle Mark Miller' brought me from the station with his ancient buggy and what he calls his 'generous purpose' horse. He is a nice old man {{and gave me a}} handful of pink peppermints. Peppermints always seem to me such a religious sort of candy--I suppose because when I was a little girl Grandmother Gordon always gave them to me in church. Once I asked, referring to the smell of peppermints, 'Is that the odor of sanctity?' I didn't like to eat Uncle Mark's peppermints <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> fished them loose out of his pocket, and had to pick some rusty nails and other things from among them before he gave them to me. But I wouldn't hurt his dear old feelings for anything, so I carefully sowed them along the road at intervals. When the last one was gone, Uncle Mark said, a little rebukingly, 'Ye shouldn't a'et all them candies to onct, Miss Phil. You'll likely have the stummick-ache.' ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>he</b> played <b>just</b> 11 {{games in}} the 1987-88 regular season, he {{maintained}} his rookie status for the next season. The next season, Burke was elected into the NHL All-Star Game.|$|R
25|$|In 1921, {{at the age}} of 43, Goodloe {{resigned}} {{his post}} at Bowie. Goodloe told a friend of his in Washington that <b>he</b> resigned <b>because</b> <b>he</b> was <b>just</b> tired of being principal.|$|R

5000|$|Shorty Gorham (bullfighter) - It {{was like}} saying, [...] "Hey, I'm the {{original}} badass. You guys all get your cameras {{out and take}} away." [...] <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> knew and the pride was very obvious.|$|E
5000|$|Some of Zarefsky's more notable {{students}} include: University of California, Irvine Founding Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky; United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit federal appellate judge Merrick B. Garland; {{and former}} White House Chief of Staff and current Mayor of Chicago Rahm Emanuel. Asked about Emanuel's reputation for ruthlessness, Zarefsky {{was quoted in}} The Daily Northwestern as saying, [...] "I {{think it can be}} applied to him in a positive sense <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> very determined to achieve his goals." ...|$|R
60|$|John Joiner smelt the pudding; but {{he regretted}} {{that he had}} not time to stay to dinner, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> {{finished}} making a wheel-barrow for Miss Potter, and she had ordered two hen-coops.|$|R
60|$|Aur. Never doubt {{but he will}} succeed: Your brisk fool, {{that can}} make a leg, is ever a fine gentleman among the ladies, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is <b>just</b> of their talent, and they {{understand}} him better than a wit.|$|R
50|$|Glum {{caterpillars}} appear, as {{the narrator}} has no idea why they are glum. Just then, a happy caterpillar comes crawling on-screen. The caterpillar says that he's happy <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> got a retread. He laughs, and rolls off.|$|E
50|$|Longarm is {{the name}} of an Autobot {{tow-truck}} in the 2007 Transformers movie toy line who just wants to help out. He is proud of being an Autobot, <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> wants to help others, saving lives, and protecting the weak. He just doesn't understand the Decepticons at all.|$|E
5000|$|Travis {{ended his}} career with 285 receptions, the fifth-highest total in NCAA Division II history. [...] "He was a {{mismatch}} for linebackers because he could run around them," [...] said West Liberty head coach Roger Walalae. [...] "And he was a mismatch for cornerbacks who came up <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> ran them over." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{suspect was}} arrested while {{drinking}} {{at a restaurant}} bar in Clinton, Missouri, about 82 miles km away. He had attracted the barman's attention by saying he needed a place to hide <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> killed two Middle Eastern men.|$|R
60|$|He was {{a little}} distraught <b>because</b> <b>he</b> had <b>just</b> seen Sir Isaac step forward in a {{crouching}} attitude from beyond {{the edge of the}} lilacs, peer at the tea-table with a serpent-like intentness and then dart back convulsively into cover....|$|R
50|$|As {{the film}} ends, a boy is being tucked into bed by his parents. <b>He</b> is scared <b>because</b> <b>he</b> has <b>just</b> lost his last baby tooth. He finds his mother {{replaced}} the tooth {{with a gold}} coin, showing that Matilda and her curse are gone.|$|R
50|$|When {{he returns}} to the town, the mayor refuses to pay him the bag of gold <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> played a pipe, and gives him one coin, while the other adults laugh at him.

5000|$|John W. [...] "Jack" [...] Burns (Kirk Douglas) {{works as}} a roaming ranch hand much as the cowboys of the old West did, refusing to join modern society. He rejects much of modern technology, not even {{carrying}} any identification such as a driver's license or draft card. He can't provide an address <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> sleeps wherever he finds a place.|$|E
5000|$|Slava Kuperstein of HipHopDX {{gave the}} mixtape a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "Meek can capably flow, but heâ€™s not nearly the consistent {{presence on the}} mic as, say, a Young Jeezy or a Rick Rossâ€”partly <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>just</b> flat-out refuses to switch up the delivery. Ultimately, a fairly strong guest list and a good ear for beats is enough to carry this project." ...|$|E
5000|$|Milo {{takes the}} girls to Caseyâ€™s Surfer, the hangout on the pier where the surfers and their ilk gather. While the girls get into the club on the virtue that Terry is Skeetâ€™s sister, Milo is kept out <b>because</b> <b>he</b> is <b>just</b> a [...] "gremmie".|$|R
5000|$|The film {{is about}} an all-female {{motorcycle}} gang named the [...] "Cycle Sluts", who cruise into the isolated town of Zariah {{looking for a good}} time. Here, an evil scientist-turned-mortician has been killing local townspeople with the aid of his long-suffering dwarf assistant ("If God wanted you to do normal things, he would have made you look like normal people") and turning them into zombies to use as labor at an abandoned mine. The mine is too radioactive after underground nuclear testing to be mined by living people. Although the scientist later admits that the real reason he's been doing it is not the money, but <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> plain mean.|$|R
5000|$|Now that Archie is dating Hilda, Hilda is {{starting}} to have issues about this romance because that she's not quite feeling it for him or maybe <b>because</b> <b>he's</b> <b>just</b> so nice to her. During a date at a diner and just as she's about to break up with him, a woman named Felissa shows up, fawning all over him and with good reason: she used to date Archie. That incident doesn't detour Hilda by inviting Archie back to the house, but when he suspects that she was only turned on when it seemed like another woman wanted him, he leaves immediately, {{even though she was}} just kidding.|$|R
