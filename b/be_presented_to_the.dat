5|$|Constitution Square {{has hosted}} an annual charity run {{every year since}} 1978. After the opening of Danville's Community Arts Center in 2004, Ernst Crown-Weber, a local businessman, renamed the event Constitution Square 5K Run for the Arts and began {{organizing}} {{it as a way}} to raise money for the center. A local artist, Alison Craig, designs original awards to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> winners.|$|E
5|$|The National Hockey League honoured Smythe's {{contribution}} to the game by introducing the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1965, to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup playoffs. After his death, the trophy was renamed the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy. The league also named one of its four divisions, the Smythe Division, after him prior to the 1974–75 season.|$|E
5|$|In 1816, George, Prince Regent (later George IV), {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} a commemorative medal to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> victorious generals and national leaders of the Battle of Waterloo. That triumph the previous year had defeated Napoleon and brought peace to Europe after almost two decades. The medal was to be given in gold to the heads of state and in silver to the victorious generals. Others to be honoured would receive the medal in bronze. The usual procedure for the time was followed: the Royal Academy were asked to submit a design. They proposed work by one of their members, John Flaxman.|$|E

5|$|In 1940, when General Zhukov was {{promoted}} to commander of the Kiev Military District in the Ukrainian SSR, Bagramyan wrote a letter asking to serve under his command. Zhukov agreed, and in December asked for his help writing a paper to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> commanders of the Soviet Military Districts. Bagramyan's paper, Conducting a Contemporary Offensive Operation, apparently impressed Zhukov, as he promoted Bagramyan to become the head of Operations for the Soviet 12th Army based in Ukraine. Within three months however, Bagramyan, then a colonel, was appointed {{deputy chief of staff}} of the Southwestern Front, headquartered in Kiev.|$|E
5|$|Scottish white terriers were {{recorded}} {{as early as}} {{during the reign of}} James VI of Scotland, who reigned between 1567 and 1625. The king ordered that a dozen terriers be procured from Argyll to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Kingdom of France as a gift. Sandy- and brindle-coloured dogs were seen as hardier than those of other colours, and white dogs were seen as being weak. At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the Scottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds.|$|E
5|$|The League's health {{organisation}} {{had three}} bodies: the Health Bureau, containing permanent {{officials of the}} League; the General Advisory Council or Conference, an executive section consisting of medical experts; and the Health Committee. The Committee's purpose was to conduct inquiries, oversee {{the operation of the}} League's health work, and prepare work to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Council. This body focused on ending leprosy, malaria, and yellow fever, the latter two by starting an international campaign to exterminate mosquitoes. The Health Organisation also worked successfully with the government of the Soviet Union to prevent typhus epidemics, including organising a large education campaign.|$|E

5|$|The Parliament has 20 Standing Committees {{consisting}} of 25 to 71 MEPs each (reflecting the political make-up {{of the whole}} Parliament) including a chair, a bureau and secretariat. They meet twice a month in public to draw up, amend to adopt legislative proposals and reports to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> plenary. The rapporteurs for a committee are supposed to present {{the view of the}} committee, although notably this has not always been the case. In the events leading to the resignation of the Santer Commission, the rapporteur went against the Budgetary Control Committee's narrow vote to discharge the budget, and urged the Parliament to reject it.|$|E
5|$|The US {{government}} {{was aware of}} these activities in Cambodia, but refrained from taking overt military action within Cambodia in hopes of convincing the mercurial Sihanouk to alter his position. To accomplish this, President Lyndon B. Johnson authorized covert cross-border reconnaissance operations conducted by the secret Studies and Observations Group in order to gather intelligence on PAVN/NLF activities in the border regions (Project Vesuvius). This intelligence data would then <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prince {{in an effort to}} change his mind.|$|E
5|$|Under the Belarus Constitution (Part 4, Chapter 3, Article 84), the President of the Republic has {{the power}} to bestow state awards. To {{announce}} an award, the President issues a decree conferring the title to a person. Within two months, the title will be presented by the President in a formal setting, usually at the Presidential Palace in the capital city of Minsk. A certificate (gramota) will also <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> recipient, signed by the President of the Republic.|$|E

5|$|At the Norman Conquest, the {{settlement}} of Wigan {{was part of the}} larger parish of Wigan which, the majority of which was within the hundred of Newton. On 26 August 1246, Wigan was granted a Royal Charter, making the town a free borough. This happened after Salford was granted its Charter in 1230 and before Manchester in 1301. As a borough, Wigan was represented in the Model Parliament from 1295–1306 by two burgesses– freemen of the borough. The Charter allowed taxes to be made on transactions made in the borough by tradesmen and permitted the local burgesses to establish a guild that would regulate trade in the borough. Non-members of the guild were not allowed to do business in the borough without permission from the burgesses. It is thought that when the Charter was reconfirmation in 1350 it was changed, allowing the election of a mayor of Wigan for the first time. Three burgesses were elected to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lord of the manor who would choose one man to be mayor for a year.|$|E
5|$|John Bevan {{had asked}} Newman Smith {{to retain the}} threat of a US {{invasion}} force beyond 28 June when the initial deception was supposed to have ended. Agent Rudloff sent messages on 10, 12 and 18 July referring to the Ironside force. In mid-July, the Allies began Operation Ferdinand, a cover deception for Operation Dragoon, the August 1944 invasion of southern France. The Ironside story was considered as an option in support of Ferdinand, but Noel Wild and Ops (B), the SHAEF deception planners were worried about the impact of a theoretical US invasion force on the continuing Fortitude deception. It was decided that a new story would <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Germans, suggesting that the Allies intended to bolster French resistance in the south of the country. The operation went largely unnoticed and German interest in the Bordeaux region dissipated.|$|E
5|$|Studies {{have sought}} to find the precise {{function}} of Mups in pheromone communication. Mup proteins {{have been shown to}} promote puberty and accelerate the estrus cycle in female mice, inducing the Vandenbergh and Whitten effects. However, in both cases the Mups had to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> female dissolved in male urine, indicating that the protein requires some urinary context to function. In 2007 Mups normally found in male mouse urine were made in transgenic bacteria, and therefore created devoid of the chemicals they normally bind. These Mups were shown to be sufficient to promote aggressive behaviour in males, {{even in the absence of}} urine. In addition, Mups made in bacteria were found to activate olfactory sensory neurons in the vomeronasal organ (VNO), a subsystem of the nose known to detect pheromones via specific sensory receptors, of mice and rats. Together, this demonstrated that Mup proteins can act as pheromones themselves, independent of their ligands.|$|E

5|$|The Diet {{responsibilities}} {{includes the}} making of laws, {{the approval of the}} annual national budget, the approval of the conclusion of treaties and the selection of the Prime Minister. In addition, it has the power to initiate draft constitutional amendments, which, if approved, are to <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> people for ratification in a referendum before being promulgated by the Emperor, {{in the name of the}} people. The Constitution also enables both houses to conduct investigations in relation to government, demand the presence and testimony of witnesses, and the production of records, as well as allowing either house of the Diet to demand the presence of the Prime Minister or the other Minister of State, in order to give answers or explanations whenever so required. The Diet is also able to impeach Court judges convicted of criminal or irregular conduct. The Constitution, however, does not specify the voting methods, the number of members of each house, and all other matters pertaining to the method of election of the each members, and are thus, allowed to be determined for by law.|$|E
5|$|The host {{city for}} an Olympic Games is usually chosen {{seven to eight}} years ahead of their celebration. The process of {{selection}} is carried out in two phases that span a two-year period. The prospective host city applies to its country's National Olympic Committee; if more than one city from the same country submits a proposal to its NOC, the national committee typically holds an internal selection, since only one city per NOC can <b>be</b> <b>presented</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> International Olympic Committee for consideration. Once the deadline for submission of proposals by the NOCs is reached, the first phase (Application) begins with the applicant cities {{asked to complete a}} questionnaire regarding several key criteria related to the organisation of the Olympic Games. In this form, the applicants must give assurances that they will comply with the Olympic Charter and with any other regulations established by the IOC Executive Committee. The evaluation of the filled questionnaires by a specialised group provides the IOC with an overview of each applicant's project and their potential to host the Games. On the basis of this technical evaluation, the IOC Executive Board selects the applicants that will proceed to the candidature stage.|$|E
