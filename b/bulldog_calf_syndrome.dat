40|$|We {{identified}} an IARS (isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase) c. 235 G. C (p. Val 79 Leu) substitution as the causative mutation for neonatal weakness with {{intrauterine growth}} retardation (perinatal weak <b>calf</b> <b>syndrome).</b> In Japanese Black cattle, the syndrome was frequently found in calves sired by Bull A. Hence, we employed homozygosity mapping and linkage analysis. In {{order to identify}} the perinatal weak <b>calf</b> <b>syndrome</b> locus in a 4. 04 -Mb region of BTA 8, we analysed a paternal half-sibling family with a BovineSNP 50 BeadChip and microsatellites. In this critical region, we performed exome sequencing to identify a causative mutation. Three variants were detected as possible candidates for causative mutations that were predicted to disrupt the protein function, including a G. C (p. Val 79 Leu) mutation in IARS c. 235. The IARS c. 235 G. C mutation was not a homozygous risk allele in the 36 healthy offspring of Bull A. Moreover, the IARS Val 79 residue and its flanking regions were evolutionarily and highly conserved. The IARS mutant (Leu 79) had decreased aminoacylation activity. Additionally, the homozygous mutation was not found in any of 1526 healthy cattle. Therefore, we concluded that the IARS c. 235 G. C mutation was th...|$|R

40|$|Serological {{studies on}} Haemophilus somnus {{infection}} {{were carried out}} on 1795 cattle from 231 dairy herds {{in the province of}} Quebec. An epidemiological investigation was done in each of the dairy operations. Seroreactivity rate and mean log 2 titer for all the sera were 55. 4 % and 4. 1620 respectively. Cattle from eastern regions of Quebec demonstrated the lowest prevalence of H. somnus agglutinins. The percentage of seroreactor animals was 60. 3 in herds of 100 cattle or more in comparison to 53. 2 in herds of smaller size. About 75 % of the animals from 16 herds in which one or more cattle showed nervous manifestations of undetermined origin over a one year period had antibodies to H. somnus. Herds in which respiratory diseases occurred had 59. 6 % seroreactor animals and herds in which weak <b>calf</b> <b>syndrome</b> was diagnosed over a one year period had 61. 4 % seroreactor animals.

40|$|Bovine {{neonatal}} pancytopenia (BNP; previously {{known as}} idiopathic haemorrhagic diathesis and {{commonly known as}} bleeding <b>calf</b> <b>syndrome)</b> is a novel haemorrhagic disease of young calves which has emerged {{in a number of}} European countries during recent years. Data were retrospectively collected during June to November 2010 for 56 case calves diagnosed with BNP between 17 March and 7 June of the same year. These were compared with 58 control calves randomly recruited from herds with no history of BNP. Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that increased odds of a calf being a BNP case were associated with its dam having received PregSure® BVD (Pfizer Animal Health) vaccination prior to the birth of the calf (odds ratio (OR) 40. 78, p< 0. 001) and its herd of origin being located in Scotland (OR 9. 71, p =  0. 006). Decreased odds of a calf being a BNP case were associated with the calf having been kept outside (OR 0. 11, p =  0. 006). The longer that a cattle herd had been established on the farm was also associated with decreased odds of a calf in that herd being a BNP case (OR 0. 97, p =  0. 011) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{chimeric}} gene encoding enhanced {{green fluorescent protein}} (EGFP) and a S-layer protein from Lactobacillus brevis KCTC 3102, and/or two copies of the Fc-binding Z-domain, a synthetic analog of the B-domain of protein A, was constructed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 (DE 3). The S-layer fusion proteins produced in a 500 -l fermentor {{were likely to be}} stable in the range of pH 5 to 8 and 0 o C to 40 o C. Their adhesive property enabled an easy and rapid immobilization of enzymes or antibodies on solid materials such as plastics, glass, sol-gel films, and intestinal epithelial cells. Owing to their affinity towards intestinal cells and immunoglobulin G, the S-layer fusion proteins enabled the adhesion of antibodies to human epithelial cells. In addition, feeding a mixture of the S-layer fusion proteins and antibodies against neonatal calf diarrhea (coronavirus, rotavirus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella typhimurium) to Hanwoo calves resulted in 100 % prevention of neonatal <b>calf</b> diarrhea <b>syndrome</b> (p< 0. 01), whereas feeding antibodies only resulted in 56 % prevention...|$|R
40|$|A {{questionnaire}} survey aiming to elucidate the perception among veterinarians on {{the association between}} diarrhea in calves and Weak <b>Calf</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (WCS) was conducted in Japan, and 248 veterinarians in 39 prefectures answered the questionnaire. Among the respondents, 85. 5 % belonged to NOSAI (Farmers’ Mutual Aid Association), 3. 2 % were independent veterinarians, 5. 2 % were herd management service veterinarians, and 6. 5 % answered others. Male were 83. 5 %, and female 16. 5 %. Questionnaire covered reasons of WCS, diagnosis and prevention, characteristics of well-managed farms with fewer cases of diarrhea, and collection of information on calf diarrhea. Regarding the contribution of WCS on diarrhea, 77. 8 % answered that the contribution is large or non-negligible, and 56. 3 % answered {{that the proportion of}} diarrhea with WCS is less than 5 %, and 22. 1 % answered that the proportion is more than 10 %. According to the cattle breeds which the veterinarian deals with mainly, the proportion of answering that WCS affects diarrhea greatly or non-negligibly was significantly higher among those who deal with Holstein (Hol, 64 / 92, 69. 5 %) breed than Japanese Black (JB, 91 / 110, 82. 7 %, x 2 = 4. 2, df = 1, p = 0. 04). The most common two answers for the cause of WCS were pedigree and nutritional status at the late stage of pregnancy, and especially veterinarians of 40 s and 50 s age raised pedigree. Nutrition status at fetus stage, and history of colostrum feeding were second and third common answers. When the respondents are stratified by main breeds dealing with, both groups dealing with Hol and JB prioritized pedigree and nutritional status at the late stage of pregnancy. However, Hol group tended to raise accidents at delivery and infection in fetus, while JB group pedigree and nutrition at fetus stage, in the second place. Most common criterion of diagnosis with WCS was light body weight, and low vitality, weak suckling of colostrum followed, and as higher age, larger proportion answered light body weight. Most common counter major against WCS was nutrition management around delivery, which accounted more than 50 %, and selection of pedigree at insemination and colostrum management followed. Common answers as the second rank were suckling and environmental hygiene management after delivery. Veterinarians chose hygiene, delivery - colostrum management, skill for observation, and feeding management commonly as characteristic of good practice farms with fewer diarrhea; however the proportions varied. For the same question, Hol group tended to answer delivery – colostrum management, while JB group feeding management. As shown above, the perception of WCS among veterinarians differed according to their age and the main cattle breeds dealing with...|$|R

40|$|Background: Laterality {{disorders}} of {{the abdominal}} organs include situs inversus totalis that mirrors the arrangements of all internal organs and heterotaxy syndrome (situs ambiguus) {{in which the}} thoracic or abdominal organs are abnormally arranged. Heterotaxy is often accompanied by multiple congenital malformations, and it generally comprises asplenia and polysplenia syndromes. To our knowledge, polysplenia syndrome {{has been reported in}} only three cattle, and computerized tomographic (CT) images of these animals were not obtained. Case presentation: A six-month-old Holstein heifer had ruminal tympani and right abdominal distension. CT imaging showed that the rumen occupied {{the right side of the}} abdominal cavity, the omasum and abomasum occupied the left ventral side and the liver was positioned on the left. The colon and cecum were located at the left dorsum of the cavity, and the left kidney was located more cranially than the right. Postmortem findings revealed two spleens attached to the rumen. Significantly, the duodenum was too short to be divided into segments, except the cranial and descending parts, or flexures, except the cranial flexure, and the pancreas, which lacked a left lobe, was covered with mesojejunum. The liver comprised a relatively large right lobe and a small left lobe without quadrate and caudate lobes. The caudal vena cava that connected to the left azygous vein passed irregularly through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm, and the common hepatic vein without the caudal vena cava passed through the caval foramen. Although the lungs and heart were morphologically normal, the right atrium received three major systemic veins. Polysplenia syndrome was diagnosed based on the CT and postmortem findings. Conclusion: We defined the positions of the abdominal organs and morphological abnormalities in various organs of a <b>calf</b> with polysplenia <b>syndrome</b> based on CT and postmortem findings. These findings will improve understanding of the malpositioning and malformations that can occur in the organs of cattle with polysplenia syndrome. © 2017 The Author(s).
