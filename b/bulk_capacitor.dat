40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} high-efficiency {{single-stage}} ac/dc converter. The proposed converter features low voltage stresses and reduced switching losses. It operates at {{the boundary of}} discontinuous- and continuous-conduction modes by employing variable switching frequency control. The turn-on switching loss of the switch can be reduced by turning it on when the voltage across it is at a minimum. The voltage across the <b>bulk</b> <b>capacitor</b> is independent of the output loads and maintained within the practical range for the universal line input, so the problem of high voltage stress across the <b>bulk</b> <b>capacitor</b> is alleviated. Moreover, the voltage stress of the output diodes is clamped to the output voltage, and the output diodes are turned off at zero-current. Thus, the reverse-recovery related losses of the output diodes are eliminated. The operational principles and circuit analysis are presented.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{integrated}} buck- flyback converter {{as a good}} solution for implementing low- cost high-power-factor ac-dc converters with fast output regulation. It will be shown that, when both buck and flyback semistages are operated in discontinuous conduction mode, the voltage across the <b>bulk</b> <b>capacitor,</b> {{which is used to}} store energy at low frequency, is independent of the output power. This makes it possible to maintain the <b>bulk</b> <b>capacitor</b> voltage at a low value within the whole line voltage range. This project implements a buck converter for the first stage and flyback converter for output stage. These topologies are very good solution for fast output dynamics. Another advantage of this integrated buck-flyback converter, is that switch handles the highest of buck or flyback current not addition of both currents. The remaining current is handled by the diodes of the integrated switch, which gives lower losses. The buck capacitor voltage is independent of load, duty cycle, and switching frequency and it only depends on the ac input voltage and the ratio of the two buck and flyback inductance. This is an important feature of the integrated converter operating in discontinuous mode, which allows them to provide fast output voltage regulation. The simulation has been performed to verify the feasibility of the proposed LED lamp driver...|$|E

40|$|It is {{perceived}} that Moore’s Law will prevail {{at least for}} the next decade, with continuous advancements of processing technologies for very-large-scale integrated (VLSI) circuits.

Interleaving consists in paralleling two “small ” stages {{in lieu of a}} bigger one, which may be more difficult to design. Practically, two 150 -W PFC stages are combined to form our 300 -W PFC pre-regulator. This approach has several merits like the ease of implementation, the use of more but smaller components or a better heat distribution. Also, Interleaving extends the power range of Critical Conduction Mode (CrM) that is an efficient and cost-effective technique (no need for low trr diodes). Even, as reported by NCP 1631 EVB/D [3], when associated to the Frequency Clamped Critical conduction Mode (FCCrM), this technique yields particularly high efficiency levels (about 95 % over a large load range at 90 Vrms in a 300 -W application).

40|$|AC/DC {{adapters}} mostly employ two-stage topology: Power Factor Correction (PFC) pre-regulation stage {{followed by}} an isolated DC/DC converter stage. Low power AC/DC adapters require a small size to be competitive. Among their components, the bulk DC-link capacitor {{is one of the}} largest because it should keep the output voltage with low ripple. Also, the size of this capacitor is penalized due to the universal line voltage application. Synchronization through employing leading edge modulation for the first PFC stage and trailing edge modulation for the second DC/DC converter stage can significantly reduce the ripple current and ripple voltage of the DC-link capacitor. Thus, a smaller DC-link capacitance can be used, lowering the cost and size of the AC/DC adapter. Benefits of the synchronous switching scheme were already demonstrated experimentally. However, no mathematical analysis was presented. In this thesis, detailed mathematical analyses in per-unit quantity are given to facilitate the calculation of the DC-link capacitor ripple current reduction with Leading/Trailing Edge Modulation strategies. One of the limitations of leading/trailing edge modulation is that the switching frequencies of the two stages need to be equal to achieve the best reduction of the DC-link capacitor ripple current. The DC-link capacitor ripple current will become larger if the switching frequency of the DC/DC converter is larger than that of the PFC pre-regulator, which blocks us to employ higher frequency for isolated DC/DC converter to reduce its transformer size. This thesis proposed a new Leading/Trailing Edge Modulation strategy to further reduce the DC-link <b>bulk</b> <b>capacitor</b> ripple current when switching frequency of DC/DC converter stage is twice the switching frequency of PFC stage. This proposed pulse width modulation scheme was verified by simulation. Experimental results obtained through digital control based on FPGA are also presented in this thesis...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Micro-inverters {{operating}} {{into the}} single-phase grid from solar photovoltaic (PV) panels or other low-voltage sources must buffer the twice-line-frequency variations between the energy sourced by the PV panel and that {{required for the}} grid. Moreover, in addition to operating over wide average power ranges, they inherently operate {{over a wide range}} of voltage conversion ratios as the line voltage traverses a cycle. These factors make the design of micro-inverters challenging. This paper presents a Multilevel Energy Buffer and Voltage Modulator (MEB) that significantly reduces the range of voltage conversion ratios that the dc-ac converter portion of the micro-inverter must operate over by stepping its effective input voltage in pace with the line voltage. The MEB partially replaces the original <b>bulk</b> input <b>capacitor,</b> and functions as an active energy buffer to reduce the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance. The small additional loss of the MEB can be compensated by the improved efficiency of the dc-ac converter stage, leading to a higher overall system efficiency. The MEB architecture can be implemented in a variety of manners, allowing different design tradeoffs to be made. A prototype micro-inverter incorporating an MEB, designed for 27 V to 38 V dc input voltage, 230 V rms ac output voltage, and rated for a line cycle average power of 70 W, has been built and tested in a grid-connected mode. It is shown that the MEB can successfully enhance the performance of a single-phase grid-interfaced micro-inverter by increasing its efficiency and reducing the total size of the twice-line-frequency energy buffering capacitance.

40|$|This thesis investigates {{controlling}} a {{dc-dc converter}} connecting a capacitor or ultracapacitor (UC) to a dc voltage bus by regulating the series impedance of the converter. Decoupling the capacitance from the voltage bus {{is shown to}} reduce the size and/or weight of the power source. The impedance of the dc-dc converter is shaped by a high-pass filter so that it is low at high frequencies, but infinite at dc. This shaped-impedance controller allows load current to be shared between the dc source and decoupled capacitor, even when the dc source is uncontrolled, as long as the dc source has nonzero source impedance. Charge transfer to and from the capacitor is limited to a finite value proportional to a step change in bus voltage. 	The same control approach was applied to the converter which added decoupled bus capacitance to an electric vehicle power source, where the dc source is a battery connected directly to the output voltage bus, and to a voltage regulator module (VRM) for a desktop computer processor. Design equations and small- and large-signal models are developed in detail for the vehicle power source. A second loop was added to the controller to help regulate UC charge level. Small-signal system stability is verified across the range of expected operating points. Experimental results of a scaled-down combined source verify theoretical predictions. For the VRM, a multiphase buck converter is augmented by a second set of phases which carry only fast current transients. Large-signal models and switch dissipation analyses predict that the proposed topology eliminates the need for <b>bulk</b> electrolytic <b>capacitors</b> on the voltage bus yet has efficiency comparable to a conventional multiphase VRM...|$|R
