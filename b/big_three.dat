5|$|AFL teams won {{the next}} two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged {{to form a new}} 26-team league. The {{resulting}} newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of Monday Night Football gave the NFL broadcast rights on all of the <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues between home and visiting teams.|$|E
5|$|After manager Ronald Koeman's departure, Benfica {{immediately}} {{searched for}} a replacement. Media speculated the club would sign Sven-Göran Eriksson and later Carlos Queiroz, but Benfica signed the former Porto and Sporting CP manager Fernando Santos. Santos was the first manager since Fernando Riera to manage all of Portugal's <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> clubs. In the transfer market, Benfica brought back Rui Costa and recruited other notable players including Katsouranis and David Luiz. Fabrizio Miccoli had his loan renewed for a second year, while Geovanni, Manuel Fernandes and Ricardo Rocha left the club during the season.|$|E

5|$|During the 2010 offseason, the Miami Heat re-signed {{team captain}} Dwyane Wade and added free agents Chris Bosh and LeBron James {{to form the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Three.</b> The Heat were then {{considered}} the favorites by many to win multiple championships, appearing {{in the next four}} finals, and winning two, in 2012 and 2013.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Filmation began {{producing}} several new {{series for the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks. They started creating live action series, instead of just animation ones, and also series that combined both. While {{a majority of the}} series was animated, live-action segments involving actual animals were also included to separate different scenes in an episode. According to Scheimer, filming with the animals was tough, as the bulldog who portrayed Tyrone would often chase the cats on set around and not stay still during filming.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> {{television}} networks, {{the local}} {{stations in the}} NTA Film Network were not connected via coaxial cable or microwave relay. Instead, NTA Film Network programs were filmed and then mailed to each station in the network, a method used by television syndicators in the 1950s and 1960s. However, many local stations agreed to broadcast NTA Film Network programs in pattern (simultaneously). Landau's claim to network status {{was based on the}} simultaneous airing of the programs.|$|E

5|$|Reynolds and Reynolds {{was founded}} in 1866 as a printer of {{standardized}} business forms. It began developing and marketing digital products in the 1960s. This {{was followed by a}} major down-sizing of the printing division and subsequent advancements in its software products. By the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds had won contracts with all of the <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> automotive manufacturers, as well as some insurance businesses. The company went public in 1961, but was re-formed as a private company in 2006, when it was merged with Universal Computer Systems, resulting in a culture clash between the two companies.|$|E
5|$|Speed Buggy {{lasted for}} one {{season with a}} total of sixteen episodes. Despite its short run, it was {{broadcast}} on the <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks years after its original run as the channels had purchased syndication rights. It was speculated that the series acquired a fan base due to its frequent rotation on American television. Critical response to Speed Buggy was generally positive; some critics enjoyed its shared themes with Josie & the Pussycats and Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, while others found it unmemorable and overly repetitive. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a four disc set.|$|E
5|$|The {{assassination}} attempt was captured on video by several cameras, including those {{belonging to the}} <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> television networks; ABC began airing footage at 2:42p.m. All three networks erroneously reported that Brady had died. While the Cable News Network (CNN) {{did not have a}} camera of its own at the shooting it was able to use NBC's pool feed, and by staying on the story for 48 hours, the network, less than a year old, built a reputation for thoroughness. Shocked Americans gathered around television sets in homes and shopping centers. Some cited the alleged Curse of Tippecanoe, and others recalled the assassinations of Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr. Newspapers printed extra editions and used gigantic headlines; the United States Senate adjourned, interrupting debate of Reagan's economic proposals; and churches held prayer services.|$|E

That morning the senators reviewed anti-poverty programs underway in Greenville and a nearby tent city that had been established by striking farm workers. After lunch, Kennedy's and Clark's motorcade traveled at speeds over 80mph down U.S. Route 61 to visit locations specifically selected by Wright and Moore.|$|E
5|$|While Burger King's {{advertising}} {{programs were}} highly focused on its new product, {{most of the}} company's sales gains {{were the result of}} aggressive price cutting by Burger King, specifically pricing its signature Whopper sandwich at 99¢, according to analysts at Salomon Brothers. The price cutting promotions by Burger King, and number-three chain Wendy's, forced McDonald's into its own price cutting program. According to Salomon, the burger segment's price wars would have a detrimental effect on the profits of segment leaders, allowing other smaller chains such as Sonic Drive-In, Jack in the Box and Carl's Jr to position themselves as attractive alternatives to the <b>big</b> <b>three</b> chains.|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s, Reynolds and Reynolds signed {{agreements}} {{with the rest of}} the <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> automotive manufacturers, several major insurers, General Electric and others. In 1986 the company acquired National Medical Computer Services and a business forms company called Arnold Corporation. By the end of that year, Reynolds had more than $200 million in annual revenue, 42 percent of which came from business forms. Reynolds acquired several smaller technology companies in the 1990s and further developed its software products. Reynolds and Reynolds acquired PD Medical Systems in 1994, forming Reynolds Healthcare Systems. Reynolds Healthcare Systems in turn later acquired a business document company, Fiscal Information, which serves radiologists. From 1994 to 1996, David Holmes led the acquisition of several other business forms and computer businesses outside the automotive industry for a total of $155 million. By 2000, Reynolds and Reynolds had revenues of $800 million and more than one-third of its users were General Motors dealerships. It sold the Information Solutions Group (ISG), which primarily sold business forms and supplies to non-automotive companies, that year to the Carlyle Group for $360 million.|$|E

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Ronald Koeman's departure, Portuguese media began to speculate about Benfica's next manager. They initially focused on Sven-Göran Eriksson, who had previously managed the club and was in Algarve preparing for the World Cup with England's national squad. On 17 May, Eriksson {{said he had not}} been approached to join Benfica. José Antonio Camacho's agent dismissed speculation about his return. On 19 May, SIC Notícias announced Carlos Queiroz had signed a two-year deal with Benfica. Both parties immediately denied any agreement; Queiroz said he did not intend to leave Manchester United. The following day, Benfica presented Fernando Santos as the club's new manager on a two-year contract. Santos had last managed in Portugal in 2003–04, when he led Sporting to a third-place finish, and previously spent three years at Porto, winning five major titles. He became the third manager—the first Portuguese—to manage all of the country's <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> football clubs, after Otto Glória and Fernando Riera. He would be assisted by Fernando Chalana, who remained connected with the club's management; Jorge Rosário as his long-term technical assistant; Bruno Moura as physiotherapist and Ricardo Santos as scout of the opponents.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} several months, many new punk rock bands formed, often {{directly}} inspired by the Sex Pistols. In London, women were {{near the center of}} the scene—among the initial wave of bands were the female-fronted Siouxsie and the Banshees and X-Ray Spex and the all-female the Slits. There were female bassists Gaye Advert in the Adverts and Shanne Bradley in the Nipple Erectors. Other groups included Subway Sect, Eater, Wire, The Stranglers, the Subversives, the aptly named London, and Chelsea, which soon spun off Generation X. Farther afield, Sham 69 began practicing in the southeastern town of Hersham. In Durham, there was Penetration, with lead singer Pauline Murray. On September 20–21, the 100 Club Punk Festival in London featured the four primary British groups (London's <b>big</b> <b>three</b> and Buzzcocks), as well as Paris's female-fronted Stinky Toys, arguably the first punk rock band from a non-Anglophone country. Siouxsie and the Banshees and Subway Sect debuted on the festival's first night; that same evening, Eater debuted in Manchester. On the festival's second night, audience member Sid Vicious was arrested, charged with throwing a glass at the Damned that shattered and destroyed a girl's eye. Press coverage of the incident fueled punk's reputation as a social menace.|$|E
5|$|After the 2014 Finals, LeBron James {{became a}} free agent and {{returned}} to the Cleveland Cavaliers where he teamed up with Kyrie Irving. The Cavs also traded for Kevin Love to form a new <b>Big</b> <b>Three</b> in Cleveland as they led the Cavs to the 2015 NBA Finals. In the 2015 postseason, 2014 finalist Miami Heat did not qualify in the playoffs after losing James to free agency and due to mediocrity stemming from brutal injuries all season, and the former defending champions, the San Antonio Spurs, were eliminated in a Game 7 battle against the Los Angeles Clippers in the first round. This allowed Cleveland to conquer the East. Golden State, spearheaded by reigning MVP, Stephen Curry, achieved a 67–15 record and were able to take the West. Entering the 2015 Finals, James and current Cavalier and former Heat teammate James Jones made their fifth straight finals appearance – the first two players to do this since the 1960s Celtics. The Warriors managed to defy conventional wisdom and traditionalist ideas by winning the championship with a small-ball, three-point shooting, fast-paced team. The Warriors won Game 1 in overtime, with the Cavaliers losing Irving to injury in the process. The Cavaliers would win Games 2 and 3, however, the Warriors won the next three games after coach Steve Kerr made the adjustment of inserting sixth man Andre Iguodala into the starting lineup in place of center Andrew Bogut, thus achieving the desired small-ball offense. The Warriors defeated the Cavaliers 4–2, with Iguodala becoming the first player to not start in any regular season game to win the Finals MVP award.|$|E
