Developing a new model for each small variation in different <b>business</b> <b>environments</b> {{would lead to a}} multitude of similar models. We extend UMM by a constraint mechanism for adding <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> specific constraints to models. Thus, multiple <b>business</b> <b>environments</b> may share the same model. The implementation of business process models using ebXML or Web Services is supported by choreography languages like BPSS or BPEL. These choreography languages are usually XML-based in order to be processed by a business partner’s application. Since this business application runs in the particular <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> of the <b>business</b> partner, BPSS and BPEL processes are always specific to the <b>business</b> <b>environment.</b> Consequently, this paper elaborates on the mapping of a standard UMM process model defined for multiple <b>business</b> <b>environments</b> to <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> specific BPSS processes...|$|R

(The {{first round of the}} BEEPS was implemented in 1999.) Four important conclusions arise from the analysis. First, qualitative measures of the <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> in the BEEPS appear to provide reasonably accurate measures, both across various <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> dimensions and countries and over time. These qualitative measures are compared with both objective statistical measures, where possible, and quantitative <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> measures from the BEEPS. Second, qualitative measures of the <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> show that in virtually all transition economies the <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> has improved significantly between 1999 and 2002. Third, the analysis of quantitative measures of the <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> shows a strong association between business obstacles, added costs and constraints on business, such as corruption, private security protection or obstacles, added costs and constraints on business, such as corruption, private security protection or reliance on internal sources of finance. However, evidence suggests that the nature of corruption in tax administration, which tends to be centralised, is less costly to firms than is corruption in business regulation, which is decentralised. Fourth, the analysis of firm investment and growth shows that the quality of the <b>business</b> <b>environment</b> in 1999 (based on qualitative measures) is significantly and positively associated with investment by firms in the period 1999 to 2001. It also shows that state capture significantly boosts the investment and real revenue growth rates of firms that engage in this activity, but holds back the growth performance of other firms.
