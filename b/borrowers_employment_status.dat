40|$|Many {{occupational}} studies analyze trends between {{cumulative exposure}} and mortality. The authors show that such trends are, in general, negatively confounded by <b>employment</b> <b>status.</b> Mortality rates for workers who leave work ("inactive " workers) {{are higher than}} for active workers because some workers leave because they are ill. The percentage of inactive relative to active person-time is higher in low categories of cumulative exposure, causing <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> {{to act as a}} negative confounder of exposure-response trends (the opposite occurs for time-since-hire). We illustrate these phenomena using 10 "negative " mortality studies, in which adjustment for <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> removes false trends. However, adjustment for <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> will lead to biased estimates when it acts as an intermediate variable between cumulative exposure and death, as occurs directly when exposure causes a disabling disease that, in turn, causes death or indirectly when exposure causes workers to leave work. The authors illustrate this problem using simulated follow-up data for leaving, disease incidence, and mortality. In the null case in which cumulative exposure affects neither disease incidence (or mortality) nor leaving rates, <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> indeed acts as a negative confounder of exposure-response trends, and traditional adjustment eliminates this confounding. However, when cumulative exposure affects disease incidence or rates of leaving, adjustment for <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> will not be adequate. <b>Employment</b> <b>status</b> falls under the general rubric of variables that are simultaneously confounders an...|$|R

40|$|Research on {{the effects}} of <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> on women's health has {{produced}} conflicting results. This study looked at women's health not only in the context of <b>employment</b> <b>status,</b> but also in the context of whether the subjects perceived they had some discretion or choice over that status. One hundred and seventyone women in Wanganui indicated whether they were working or not working from choice. This enabled the proposition that perceived discretion over <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> accounts for more variance in women's physical health than <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> per se, to be tested. Health status was defined for analysis by self-reports of health, symptoms, and doctor visits. In addition the frequencies of engaging in 20 health behaviours were measured. The health behaviours most often performed were those of hygiene and nutrition. Subjects also responded to questions on the meaning and value of health, barriers to health care, and other sources of health advice they would use. Results showed that subjects defined health primarily in affective terms, and over two-thirds regarded their health as very important. Cost was the most often cited barrier to health care, and health advice other than from a doctor was most likely to be sought from naturopaths and/or homeopaths. Significant intercorrelations were found between health variables. The strongest relationship was between self-rated health and symptoms, supporting the contention that women are attuned to somatic changes in their physiology. Also significant was the relationship between self-rated health and health behaviours. Employment discretion was found to be a significant factor for symptoms, self-rated health and health behaviours, but <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> was not significant. No interaction effects were found between discretion and <b>employment</b> <b>status.</b> Results indicate that women who believe they have discretion over their <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> rate their health higher, engage in more health behaviours, and report fewer symptoms than women without such perceptions. It appears that rather than focussing on the external factor of <b>employment</b> <b>status,</b> future health research may more usefully address internal factors of perceived discretion and choice...|$|R

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether <b>employment</b> <b>status</b> predicts subjective QOL and to evaluate a model in which functional capacity mediates the relationship between general cognitive performance and <b>employment</b> <b>status.</b> Ninety-three patients with schizophrenia were administered a comprehensive battery of cognitive tests, the UCSD Performance-based Skills Assessment-Brief version (UPSA-B), the Social Functioning Scale (SFS), and the Subjective Quality of Life Scale (SQLS). First, we evaluated a model for predicting the employment/occupation subscale score of the SFS using path analysis, and the model fitted well (χ 2 (4) = 3. 6, p= 0. 46; CFI= 1. 0; RMSEA< 0. 001, with 90 % CIs: 0 – 0. 152). <b>Employment</b> <b>status</b> was predicted by negative symptoms and functional capacity, which was in turn predicted by general cognitive performance. Second, we added subjective QOL to this model. In a final path model, QOL was predicted by negative symptoms and <b>employment</b> <b>status.</b> This model also satisfied good fit criteria (χ 2 (7) = 10. 3, p= 0. 17; CFI= 0. 987; RMSEA= 0. 072, with 90 % CIs: 0 – 0. 159).
