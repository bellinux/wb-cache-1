5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1944, Ron Jeffery, an agent of British and Polish intelligence in occupied Poland, eluded the Abwehr and travelled to London with a report from Poland to the <b>British</b> <b>government.</b> His efforts were at first highly regarded, but subsequently ignored by the British, which a disillusioned Jeffery attributed to the treachery of Kim Philby and other high-ranking communist agents entrenched in the British system. Jeffery tried to inform the <b>British</b> <b>government</b> about the Katyn massacre, but was as a result released from the Army.|$|E

5|$|British {{documents}} {{show that the}} <b>British</b> <b>government</b> was shaken by satyagraha. Nonviolent protest left the British confused {{about whether or not}} to jail Gandhi. John Court Curry, a British police officer stationed in India, wrote in his memoirs that he felt nausea every time he dealt with Congress demonstrations in 1930.

5|$|Despite its later {{importance}} to Britain, Gibraltar was initially {{seen by the}} <b>British</b> <b>Government</b> {{as more of a}} bargaining counter than a strategic asset. Its defences continued to be neglected, its garrisoning was an unwelcome expense, and Spanish pressure threatened Britain's vital overseas trade. On seven separate occasions between 1713 and 1728 the <b>British</b> <b>Government</b> proposed to exchange Gibraltar for concessions from Spain, but on each occasion the proposals were vetoed by the British Parliament following public protests.|$|E
5|$|In 1867, Markham was {{selected}} to accompany Sir Robert Napier's military expeditionary force to Abyssinia, as the expedition's geographer. This force was despatched by the <b>British</b> <b>government</b> {{as a response to}} actions taken by the Abyssinian King Theodore. In 1862 the king had written to the <b>British</b> <b>government</b> requesting protection against Egyptian invaders, and proposing the appointment of an ambassador. Unwilling to risk giving offence to Egypt, the <b>British</b> <b>government</b> did not reply. The king reacted to this slight by seizing and imprisoning the British consul and his staff, and ordered the arrest and whipping of a missionary who had allegedly insulted the king's mother. A belated reply to the king's letter resulted in the capture and incarceration of the deputation that brought it. After efforts at conciliation failed, the British decided to settle the matter by sending a military expedition. Because the geography of the country was so little known, it was decided that an experienced traveller with map-making skills should accompany the force, hence Markham's appointment.|$|E

Despite repeated formal declarations of their determination to seek closer union, the enthusiasm of <b>British</b> <b>governments</b> for this cause is regarded with deep scepticism by other European states. In return <b>British</b> <b>governments</b> have retained a profound suspicion of the integrationist rhetoric {{of some of the}} founder members of the European Community (EC), preferring instead to argue for incremental, pragmatic and “practical” steps towards closer co-operation. Nowhere were these differences of objectives and strategy more clearly revealed than at the meetings of the European Council in Milan (28 - 29 June 1985) and in Luxembourg (2 - 3 December 1985), and at the intervening inter-governmental conference...|$|R
5|$|The last non-royal member {{appointed}} to the order was James Hamilton, 3rd Duke of Abercorn in 1922, {{who served as the}} first Governor of Northern Ireland. When the Irish Free State left the United Kingdom that same year, the Irish Executive Council under W. T. Cosgrave chose to make no further appointments to the Order. The <b>British</b> <b>government</b> continued to entertain hopes for the order's revival as a pan-Irish institution. Therefore, while there was no legal or constitutional bar to the <b>British</b> <b>government</b> continuing to make appointments from among British subjects resident in Northern Ireland, it chose not to do so.|$|E
5|$|The {{legality}} of this seizure was seriously disputed, but the <b>British</b> <b>government</b> {{had already been}} somewhat embarrassed by {{the activities of the}} Alabama, a ship also built by Laird Son & Co and operated as a commerce raider by the Confederate Navy.
