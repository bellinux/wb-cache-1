2500|$|The Qing dynasty (1644–1912) {{controlled}} modern-day Mongolia, Tuva, Western Mongolia, and Inner Mongolia. However, {{before the}} People's Republic of China (1949–present) greatly expanded {{the territory of}} Inner Mongolia to its present shape, Inner Mongolia only referred to the Mongol areas within the Chinese provinces of Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Chahar.

Inner Mongolia, which had joined the Qing in 1636 as allies rather than conquered subjects, were directly administered and taxed by the Qing, and given access to the Qing aristocracy. Outer Mongolia was given more autonomy, nomadic rights, and its own Buddhist center.

2500|$|The modern Mongolian and Buryat Buddhist pantheons include Sagaan Ubgen, {{like many}} other figures in those pantheons, {{as a result of}} syncretism with the {{indigenous}} shamanism of the region.

[...] To account for his continued veneration as part of Buddhist practice, narratives have been added to his existing mythology, providing tales of how he was converted to Buddhism, and making him a patron of the latter religion, {{at the same time that}} he continues in his previous, more worldly, religious functions. One version of the story relates how, [...] while the Buddha and his disciples were out walking one day, they met Sagaan Ubgen, who so impressed the Buddha with his wisdom that he (Buddha) declared Sagaan Ubgen to be a [...] "saint". [...] A different version of the tale has Sagaan Ubgen as one of two hunters, the other being Hara Ubgen (...) , who, out hunting, encounter Milarepa in Milarepa's Cave. [...] Milarepa persuades them to give up hunting and to take up the teaching of Buddhism.|$|E
