Ultrasonic cleaning offers new possibilities for cleaning conveyors and other equipment that {{are not easy to}} clean. Ultrasonic cleaning was tested on three conveyor belt materials: polypropylene, acetal, and stainless steel (cold-rolled, AISI 304). Cleaning efficiency was tested at two temperatures (30 and 45 degrees C) and two cleaning times (30 and 60 s) with two cleaning detergents (KOH, and NaOH combined with KOH). Conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>materials</b> were soiled with milk-based soil and L. monocytogenes strains V 1, V 3, and B 9, and then incubated for 72 h to attach bacteria to surfaces. Ultrasonic cleaning treatments reduced L. monocytogenes counts on stainless steel 4. 61 to 5. 90 log units; on acetal, 3. 37 to 5. 55 log units; and on polypropylene, 2. 31 to 4. 40 log units. The logarithmic reduction differences were statistically analyzed by analysis of variance using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences software. The logarithmic reduction was significantly greater in stainless steel than in plastic materials (P< 0. 001 for polypropylene, P= 0. 023 for acetal). Higher temperatures enhanced the cleaning efficiency in tested materials. No significant difference occurred between cleaning times. The logarithmic reduction was significantly higher (P= 0. 013) in cleaning treatments with potassium hydroxide detergent. In this study, ultrasonic cleaning was efficient for cleaning conveyor <b>belt</b> <b>materials.</b> Reprinted with permission from Journal of Food Protection.

The Panel was charged with providing independent scientific and engineering review and recommendations with respect to the utilization of belt air and the composition and fire retardant properties of <b>belt</b> <b>materials</b> in underground coal mining. The TSP was impaneled by the Honorable Elaine L. Chao and commenced its work on January 9, 2007. At this first meeting, Mr. Richard E.

In addition, Mr. Stickler asked the Panel to review belt air velocity limitations. The Panel members attended 12 days of public meetings over a nine-month period. Three of the public meetings were scheduled for the Panel to hear from technical experts and those persons or organizations interested in providing input. The meetings were held in Coraopolis, Pennsylvania with emphasis on belt fires, belt maintenance, belt flammability and toxicity, ventilation, and escape issues; in Salt Lake City with emphasis on ground control and convergence issues; and in Birmingham with emphasis on fire detection, sensors and atmospheric monitoring systems. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) researchers, Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) personnel, representatives of the major belt conveyor manufacturers and a representative of the National Mining Association provided discussions at the Coraopolis meeting.

5000|$|The main use of {{the unit}} is to flatten out {{deformed}} press belts whilst simultaneously stress-relieving the <b>belt</b> <b>material.</b> The small size and low weight makes the unit flexible to use and easy to bring into and operate in field situations. All of the equipment needed (excluding the carriage frame and the air compressor) can be packed into a box with dimensions of about: 350mm L * 350mm W * 320mm. Total weight including blaster, valve, air hose and miscellaneous components is around 25kg and the blasting machine itself weights only 9kg. One pair of universal channel (38mm * 76mm [...] ) must be provided on site - the length usually being 500mm longer than the belt width. The channels are welded together so that the blaster can easily run through the frame {{across the face of}} the belt. The total installation time, including the manufacture of the carriage frame, is limited to just a few hours after which the peening process can begin. On the inlet air hose an electric shut-off valve is mounted to protect the belt from over-blasting should the belt suddenly stop during the blasting operation. To be effective the valve solenoid must be connected / interlocked to the press machine's power supply (240 V). For best blasting results an air supply of 4200 litre per min is required at a pressure of 6 bar. A flexible air hose is supplied with the unit which is to be connected between the blasting unit and the local air supply. All local supply pipes should have a minimum bore diameter of 1". The recommended shot blasting medium is tungsten shot (beads) with diameter ranging from 0.2-0.4 mm having a hardness exceeding 40 HRC. The machine operates by drawing a quantity of tungsten shot {{from the bottom of the}} scroll case into the high velocity nozzles. The shot is blasted onto the surface of the belt and most of the shot bounces back into the scroll case. The air is vented through the filter socks and any shot carried with the air is filtered out and drops back into the scroll case.|$|E

The reduction {{in the numbers of}} the pathogen on <b>belt</b> <b>material</b> with antimicrobial additives in the first 6 h at 10 ¬∞C was 0. 6 log unit, which was significantly higher (P < 0. 05) than the reduction of 0. 2 log unit on <b>belt</b> <b>material</b> without additives. Reductions were significantly less (P < 0. 05) in the presence of food residue. At 37 ¬∞C and 20 % relative humidity, large decreases in the numbers of the pathogen on both conveyor belt materials during the first 6 h were observed.

However, at 25 ¬∞C and 10 ¬∞C and high humidity (60 ‚Äì 75 % rh), a rapid decrease in bacterial numbers on the <b>belt</b> <b>material</b> with antimicrobial substances was observed.

40|$|This {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} electrophoresis devices and more particularly to a moving wall, continuous flow device in which an electrophoresis chamber is angularly positionable {{with respect to the}} direction of moving belt walls. A frame with an electrophoresis chamber is rotatably supported between two synchronously driven belt walls. This allows the chamber to be angularly positionable with respect to the direction of belt travel, which compensates for electroosmotic flow within the electrophoresis chamber. Injection of a buffer solution via an opening and a homogenous sample stream via another opening is performed {{at the end of a}} chamber, and collection of buffer and the fractionated species particles is done by a conventional collection array at an opposite end of the chamber. Belts are driven at a rate which exactly matches the flow of buffer and sample through the chamber, which entrains the buffer to behave as a rigid electrophoretic medium, eliminating flow distortions (Poiseuille effect). Additionally, <b>belt</b> <b>material</b> for each belt is stored at one end of the device and is taken up by drive wheels at an opposite end. The novelty of this invention particularly lies in the electrophoresis chamber being angularly positionable between two moving belt walls in order to compensate for electroosmotic flow.
