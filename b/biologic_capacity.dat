Primarily inspired to his investigation by extensive travels in Greece and Italy, the author begins with the learned women of ancient Greece-Hypatia, Sappho, and Aspasea, and of somewhat less widespread fame, Gorgo, Andromeda, and Corinna-and passes on from them to the women of ancient Rome, {{the women of the}} Middle Ages, when education was largely confined to monasteries, the women of the renaissance, and the women of subsequent and modern times. He shows during each of these epochs the advantages and opportunities offered to women in each country, and indicates where their achievements were least, and where greatest. He very conclusively proves that where opportunity was great, achievement was likewise great, and vice versa. [...] "In every department of natural knowledge," [...] he states, [...] "when not inhibited by her environment, woman has been the colleague and the emulatress, if not the peer, of the most illustrious men who have contributed to the increase and diffusion of human learning." [...] He analyzes most carefully the <b>biologic</b> <b>capacity</b> of women for scientific pursuits, coming {{to the conclusion that the}} reputed difference in intelligence between men and women is due not to difference in brain size or structure or innate power of intellect, but to education and opportunity. He then goes carefully through the historical development of each science, beginning with mathematics, going on through astronomy, physics, chemistry, the natural sciences, medicine, and surgery, archaeology,and invention, and shows the instances, extent and value of woman's contributions to each science. He concludes with the prediction that increasing education and opportunity for women will bring about ever-increasing participation in the advancement of science."

40|$|Female {{menstrual cycle}} length {{is thought to}} play an {{important}} role in couple fecundity, or the <b>biologic</b> <b>capacity</b> for reproduction irrespective of pregnancy intentions. A complete assessment of the association between menstrual cycle length and fecundity requires a model that accounts for multiple risk factors (both male and female) and the couple 2 ̆ 7 s intercourse pattern relative to ovulation. We employ a Bayesian joint model consisting of a mixed effects accelerated failure time model for longitudinal menstrual cycle lengths and a hierarchical model for the conditional probability of pregnancy in a menstrual cycle given no pregnancy in previous cycles of trying, in which we include covariates for the male and the female and a flexible spline function of intercourse timing. Using our joint modeling approach to analyze data from the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment Study, a couple based prospective pregnancy study, we found a significant quadratic relation between menstrual cycle length and the probability of pregnancy even with adjustment for other risk factors, including male semen quality, age, and smoking status...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we used {{impedance}} spectroscopy {{and gold}} electrodes {{to detect the}} presence of yeast cells and monitor the attachment of these cells to the electrodes. We analyzed the effect of conductivity changes of the medium and the attachment on the electrode-electrolyte interface impedance. A three-electrode cell was designed to produce a uniform electric field distribution on the working electrode and to minimize the counter electrode impedance. Moreover, we used a small AC overpotential (10 mV) to keep the system within the linear impedance limits of the electrode-electrolyte interface. This study proposes a new method to differentiate the impedance changes due to the attachment of yeast cells from those due to conductivity changes of the medium. The experiments showed that when {{the difference between the}} cell suspension and base solution conductivities is within the experimental error, the impedance changes are only due to the attachment of yeast cells to the electrodes. The experiments also showed a strong dependence (decrease) of the parallel capacity of the electrode electrolyte interface with the yeast cell concentration of suspension. We suggest that this decrease is due to an asymmetrical redistribution of surface charges on both sides of cell, which can be modeled as a <b>biologic</b> <b>capacity</b> connected in series with the double layer capacity of the interface. Our results could help to explain the rate of biofilm formation through the determination of the rate of cell adhesion...|$|E
40|$|Natural {{antisense}} viral transcripts {{have been}} recognized in retroviruses, including human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1), HIV- 1, and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), and have been postulated to encode proteins important for the infection cycle and/or pathogenesis of the virus. The antisense strand of the HTLV- 1 genome encodes HBZ, a novel nuclear basic region leucine zipper (b-ZIP) protein that in overexpression assays down-regulates Tax oncoprotein-induced viral transcription. Herein, we investigated the contribution of HBZ to HTLV- 1 –mediated immortalization of primary T lymphocytes in vitro and HTLV- 1 infection in a rabbit animal model. HTLV- 1 HBZ mutant viruses were generated and evaluated for viral gene expression, protein production, and immortalization <b>capacity.</b> <b>Biologic</b> properties of HBZ mutant viruses in vitro were indistinguishable from wild-type HTLV- 1, providing the first direct evidence that HBZ is dispensable for viral replication and cellular immortalization. Rabbits inoculated with irradiated cells expressing HTLV- 1 HBZ mutant viruses became persistently infected. However, these rabbits displayed a decreased antibody response to viral gene products and reduced proviral copies in {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) as compared with wild-type HTLV- 1 –infected animals. Our findings indicated that HBZ was not required for in vitro cellular immortalization, but enhanced infectivity and persistence in inoculated rabbits. This study demonstrates that retroviruses use negative-strand–encoded proteins in the establishment of chronic viral infections...|$|R
40|$|Semen {{analysis}} {{as an integral}} part of infertility investigations is taken as a surrogate measure for male fecundity in clinical andrology, male fertility, and pregnancy risk assessments. Clearly, laboratory seminology is still very much in its infancy. In as much as the creation of a conventional semen profile will always represent the foundations of male fertility evaluation, the 5 th edition of the World Health Organization (WHO) manual is a definitive statement on how such assessments should be carried out and how the quality should be controlled. A major advance in this new edition of the WHO manual, resolving the most salient critique of previous editions, is the development of the first well-defined reference ranges for semen analysis based on the analysis of over 1900 recent fathers. The methodology used in the assessment of the usual variables in semen analysis is described, as are many of the less common, but very valuable, sperm function tests. Sperm function testing is used to determine if the sperm have the <b>biologic</b> <b>capacity</b> to perform the tasks necessary to reach and fertilize ova and ultimately result in live births. A variety of tests are available to evaluate different aspects of these functions. To accurately use these functional assays, the clinician must understand what the tests measure, what the indications are for the assays, and how to interpret the results to direct further testing or patient management...|$|E
40|$|Breast cyst fluid (BCF) {{contained}} in gross cists {{is involved with}} its many biomolecules in different stages of breast cystic development. Type I apocrine and type II flattened cysts are classified based on biochemical, morphological and hormonal differences, and their different patterns of growth factors and active biocompounds may require different regulation. In a previous paper, hyaluronic acid in a very low content and chondroitin sulphate/dermatan sulphate were identified and characterized in BCF. In this new study, various apocrine and flattened BCFs were analyzed for HS concentration and disaccharide pattern. Apocrine HS was found specifically constituted of N-acetyl groups contrary to flattened HS richer in N-sulphate disaccharides with an overall N-acetylated/N-sulphated ratio significantly increased in apocrine compared with flattened (13. 5 vs 3. 7). Related to this different structural features, the charge density significantly decreased (- 30 %) in apocrine versus flattened BCFs. Finally, {{no significant differences were}} observed for HS amount (0. 9 - 1. 3 mu gml(- 1)) between the two BCF types even if a greater content was determined for flattened samples. The specifically N-sulphated sequences in flattened BCF HS can exert <b>biologic</b> <b>capacity</b> by regulating growth factors activity. On the other hand, we cannot exclude a peculiar regulation of the activity of biomolecules in apocrine BCF by HS richer in N-acetylated disaccharides. In fact, the different patterns of growth factors and active biocompounds in the two types of cysts may require different regulation by specific sequences in the HS backbone possessing specific structural characteristics and distinctive chemical groups...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} in the number of older Americans has many {{implications}} for public health, including the need to better understand the risks posed to older adults by environmental exposures. <b>Biologic</b> <b>capacity</b> declines with normal aging; this may be exacerbated in individuals with pre-existing health conditions. This decline can result in compromised pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses to environmental exposures encountered in daily activities. In recognition of this issue, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is developing a research agenda on the environment and older adults. The U. S. EPA proposes to apply an environmental public health paradigm to better understand the relationships between external pollution sources → human exposures → internal dose → early biologic effect → adverse health effects for older adults. The initial challenge will be using information about aging-related changes in exposure, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic factors to identify susceptible subgroups within the diverse population of older adults. These changes may interact with specific diseases of aging or medications used to treat these conditions. Constructs such as “frailty ” may help to capture some of the diversity in the older adult population. Data are needed regarding a) behavior/activity patterns and exposure to the pollutants in the microenvironments of older adults; b) changes in absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion with aging; c) alterations in reserve capacity that alter the body’s ability to compensate for the effects of environmental exposures; and d) strategies for effective communication of risk and risk reduction methods to older individuals and communities. This article summarizes the U. S. EPA’s development of a framework to address and prioritize the exposure, health effects, and risk communications concerns for the U. S. EPA’s evolving research program on older adults as a susceptible subpopulation. Key words: aging...|$|E
