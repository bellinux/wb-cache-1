2500|$|Barris' jokey, bumbling personality; his accentuated hand-clapping between {{sentences}} (which eventually had {{the studio}} audience joining in with him); and his catchphrases (he would usually go into commercial break with, [...] "We'll <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> <b>more</b> er... STUFF...", occasionally paired with shifting his head to reveal the ubiquitous sign behind the stage reading simply [...] "STUFF", and [...] "This is me saying 'bye'" [...] {{was one of his}} favorite closing lines) were the antithesis of the smooth TV host (such as Gary Owens, who hosted the syndicated version in its first season). Barris joined in with the eccentricity of the format, using unusual props, dressing in colorful and somewhat unusual clothing (such as the occasional hat pulled over his head, if not his eyes), he became yet another performer of the show, and for many, quite a cult hero. Dubbed [...] "Chuckie Baby" [...] by his fans, Barris was a perfect fit with the show's goofy, sometimes wild amateur performers and its panel of three judges (including regulars Jamie Farr, Jaye P. Morgan, Rex Reed and Arte Johnson). In addition, there was a growing [...] "cast of characters", including an NBC stage carpenter who played [...] "Father Ed," [...] a priest who would get flustered when his cue cards were deliberately turned upside-down; Canadian comedian Murray Langston, who as [...] "The Unknown Comic" [...] wore a paper bag over his head (with cut-outs for his eyes, mouth, and even a box of Kleenex), and [...] "Gene Gene the Dancing Machine" [...] (Gene Patton), arguably the most popular member of the [...] "cast", the show's prop man, [...] who would show up and dance whenever the band played the song [...] "Jumpin' at the Woodside". In the early 1980s, Patton was even pointed out by tour guides of incoming NBC tours as his onscreen character, {{while at the same time}} adhering to his more typical off-camera work duties.|$|E

5000|$|If Barris enjoyed an act, it {{was obvious}} - he would stand there beaming, {{clapping}} his hands, or even dancing. For the losers, no matter how bad, Barris was unfailingly positive about their performances, often consoling them afterward with allegedly comforting words of encouragement like [...] "I don't know why they did that! I loved your act. But then again, I love rancid milk." [...] The celebrity who had gonged the performer was typically asked [...] "Why'd you do that?" [...] and was expected to provide an explanation, joke, or further insult. Typically, Barris would lead into commercial breaks with the cryptic promise [...] "We'll <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back,</b> <b>with</b> mor-re stuff - right after this message!" ...|$|R

2500|$|In a major {{break with}} tradition, Epaminondas massed his cavalry and a fifty-deep column of Theban {{infantry}} {{on his left}} wing, and sent forward this body against the Spartan right. [...] His shallower and weaker center and <b>right</b> wing columns <b>were</b> drawn up so that they were progressively further {{to the right and}} rear of the proceeding column, in the so-called Echelon formation.

The Spartans' twelve-deep formation on their right wing could not sustain the heavy impact of their opponents' 50-deep column. The Spartan <b>right</b> <b>was</b> hurled <b>back</b> <b>with</b> a loss of about 1,000 men, of whom 400 were some of Sparta's most experienced soldiers, including King Cleombrotus I.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{of all the}} men!" [...] cried Mrs. Lander. But {{she seemed}} to find herself, upon reflection, less {{able to cope with}} Lander {{personally}} than with the situation generally. [...] "Will you send her up, Albe't?" [...] she asked, very patiently, as if he might be driven to further excesses, if not delicately handled. As soon as he had gone out of the room she wished that she had told him to give her time to dress and have her room put in order, before he sent the child up; but she could only make the best of herself in bed with a cap and a breakfast jacket, arranged {{with the help of a}} handglass. She had to get out of bed to put her other clothes away in the closet and she seized the chance to push the breakfast tray out of the door, and smooth up the bed, while she composed her features and her ideas to receive her visitor. Both, from long habit rather than from any cause or reason, were of a querulous cast, and her ordinary tone was a snuffle expressive of deep-seated affliction. She was at once plaintive and voluable, and in moments of excitement her need of freeing her mind was so great that she took herself into her own confidence, and found a more sympathetic listener than when she talked to her husband. As she now whisked about her room in her bed-gown with an activity not predicable of her age and shape, and finally plunged under the covering and drew it up to her chin with one hand while she pressed it out decorously over her person with the other, she kept up a rapid flow of lamentation and conjecture. [...] "I do suppose he'll <b>be</b> <b>right</b> <b>back</b> <b>with</b> her before I'm half ready; and what the man was thinkin' of to do such a thing anyway, I don't know. I don't know as she'll notice much, comin' out of such a lookin' place as that, and I don't know as I need to care if she did. But if the'e's care anywhe's around, I presume I'm the one to have it. I presume I did take a fancy to her, and I guess I shall be glad to see how I like her now; and if he's only told her I want some sewin' done, I can scrape up something to let her carry home with her. It's well I keep my things where I can put my hand on 'em at a time like this, and I don't believe I shall sca'e the child, as it is. I do hope Albe't won't hang round half the day before he brings her; I like to have a thing ova." ...|$|R

40|$|Other land {{property}} forms than the private are often conceived as residues of the past, residues that paradoxically seem never to pass away. An {{example is the}} form of semi-communal land ownership of the agricultural communities of Chile’s Region IV. Using sociological and historical research methods, this study explores the origin {{and the emergence of}} this agrarian form during the last four centuries, through the community Canela Baja and the neighbouring latifundium El Totoral, as a contrasting case. Having on one hand, the form of communal land as the common denominator, we have on the other the social aspects resulting from particular histories of the form. Therefore, a distinction between imposed and spontaneous forms is introduced. Confronting the case study with research results from other socio-political and material conditions, the study suggest that while some of the present communal ownership forms are the outcome of political decisions, others are of long historical processes. The imposed forms are not so much communities; rather reserves or homelands. Differentiating it from both private property and the so called “tragedy of the commons“, communal land ownership is conceived as an institution of its own which in Chile shares the same historical origin in colonial land grants as private property. Since they have kept their territorial integrity permanently in an undivided form, the study suggest that these agrarian collectives have historically avoided their conversion into minifundium, being thus a resource management solution, which acted as a brake to land fragmentation. Thus, the communal form represents not only another historical pattern of development, but also another way of organising ownership and production than both the latifundium and minifundium.
