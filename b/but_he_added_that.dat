25|$|Romney named Representative Paul Ryan as his vice-presidential {{running mate}} in August 2012. A year earlier, in June 2011, the Republican-controlled U.S. House of Representatives had passed a Republican {{alternative}} budget proposed by Ryan, with no Democrats voting for it. One controversial {{aspect of the}} proposal concerned Medicare; for those under age 55 as of its enactment, it would replace the existing Medicare {{system in which the}} government pays doctors, hospitals, and other medical providers fees for services rendered with a system in which the government would instead pay vouchers (also referred to as premium-support subsidies) to Medicare beneficiaries, who could then use their vouchers to either buy private medical insurance or to obtain coverage in a plan similar to traditional Medicare. Romney said that as president he would sign such a plan if it reached his desk, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> he would be putting forward his own plan before debating Obama.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, at {{the court}} of Svatopluk, who himself professed the Latin Rite, intrigues against Methodius and the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic {{gathered}} strength. Svatopluk sent John of Venice, a known opponent of the Slavic liturgy, to Rome in 879 to achieve a settlement of ecclesiastical differences. In a letter addressed to Methodius in the same year, the Pope sharply rebuked him for using Slavonic in church services. Methodius, however, travelled to Rome in 880, together with a Moravian delegation. Under his influence Pope John VIII {{changed his mind and}} in a letter, known for its incipit, Industriae tuae, the Pope repeated that Mass was to be sung in Latin whenever requested, but he also allowed the use of Slavonic liturgy. The letter also confirmed the decision taken by the Holy See during Rastislav's reign to create an archdiocese for Great Moravia. Upon Svatopluk's request the Pope promoted a German priest, Witching, to be Bishop of Nitra, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> the new Bishop and all the clerics in Great Moravia were expected to be obedient to Methodius, who remained the head of the church in Svatopluk's realms.|$|E

The Whitebrook has retained the Michelin star through to 2016, which it first earned under Harrod in 2014.|$|E

50|$|Architecture {{academic}} Philip Goad {{has suggested}} that a first classification would place Deva House within the Palazzo style, with Greek Revival details in its facade treatment, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> closer analysis reveals a more streamlined approach, with elements of Eclecticism.|$|R

500|$|Keith DeCandido {{reviewed}} the episode for Tor.com, rating it ten out of ten. He suggested the episode {{may have had}} [...] "most impressive collection of guest stars of any episode of Star Trek", lending further praise to Wert, Birkin and Dennis Creaghan as Louis. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Kemp, Eggar, Bikel and Brown was [...] "near perfect casting". He said that [...] "Family" [...] was [...] "an absolute high point of TNG {{and one of the}} best episodes they ever did", as it made the characters appear as [...] "people". He said that the writing [...] "cemented [...] place as one of the top writers of the franchise", and described the acting as [...] "simply phenomenal".|$|E
500|$|Milan were {{similarly}} astonished at {{the manner in}} which they had lost the final. Manager Carlo Ancelotti said, [...] "We had six minutes of madness in which we threw away the position we had reached until then". The result compounded Milan's failure to win Serie A a week before the match. Milan's vice-president, Adriano Galliani, played down the loss, asserting: [...] "Even if we come second in the league, and second in the Champions League, this is not a disastrous season for us". Captain Paolo Maldini was less optimistic, stating that the reverse was a [...] "huge disappointment", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> Milan would accept the defeat and [...] "go out with their heads high".|$|E
500|$|At Zanesville, Hogan signed future Cleveland Indians pitcher Samuel Pond ("Sad Sam") Jones to {{his first}} {{professional}} contract. [...] Baseball historian Alexander Edelman noted that Jones gained valuable experience {{as a member of}} the Zanesville club (including a chance to play against the Giants in an exhibition game), <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> the player [...] "was only 20 years old and very homesick". [...] When Jones was faced with the prospect of a pay cut, he approached Hogan on the street and demanded that he be released from his contract immediately. Edelman wrote: [...] "In what Sam's son, Paul, would later call 'probably the craziest release in baseball history,' Hogan obliged, writing Jones' release in pencil on the inside of a chewing tobacco packet".|$|E

5000|$|It {{has been}} claimed by some historians that many Hindus {{converted}} to Islam {{because of the}} caste system. But Lal argues that [...] "contemporary evidence does not speak of low caste as a factor contributing to conversions to Islam", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that,</b> because [...] "Muslim regime and society provided people with new avenues of employment", many people of low caste converted.|$|R
500|$|On 5 November, {{the eve of}} {{the first}} planned all out strike it was {{announced}} that strike action had been called off until at least the New Year to allow for what Brendan Barber described as [...] "a period of calm" [...] in which both Royal Mail and the CWU could reach a long term agreement. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> although the postal service would be free from disruption over the Christmas period, a long term deal was still some distance away. The CWU also announced {{on the same day that}} it would not press ahead with a legal challenge to Royal Mail's employment of temporary workers to clear the backlog, which had been due to begin at the High Court the following day.|$|E
500|$|The title track, [...] "Enamorada de Ti", {{received}} a favorable review from Guerra, {{who believed that}} its merengue version [...] "manages to work up a considerable sweat". Calling it a [...] "tropical rhythm", Banda noted {{that it is the}} earliest-recorded track on the album. Lopetegui considered it [...] "crowd-pleasing". Lovelace thought it [...] "enjoyable", saying that the merengue mix version [...] "adds a lively, tropical tone to the original slow tempo love song", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> it [...] "seems awkwardly paired when it comes to collaborating artists, who often clash with Selena's voice and the overall sound". Of the acoustic bonus tracks, Guerra wrote that they are [...] "unlikely highlights, the new instrumentation gives them all a nice edge and highlights Selena's burgeoning vocal prowess". Banda was more positive, listing them as recommended tracks that he found to be reminiscent of live Selena recordings.|$|E
500|$|Connor {{has been}} {{analyzed}} and {{compared with other}} male characters of the series {{in terms of the}} presentation and evolution of masculinity in fiction. His sexual relation with his surrogate mother, coupled with his struggles to kill his father, led to numerous speculations that mythical Greek figure Oedipus was the inspiration for the character. and references to Arthurian Legend were also made. In Erin B. Waggoner's book Sexual rhetoric in the works of Joss Whedon, he found it interesting that the ancient Oedipus complex continues {{to be used as a}} way to underscore one's masculinity, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Connor is not the only one [...] Angel, Wes, Spike and even Fred (through Gunn) kill father or father figures in order to come into their own as individuals." [...] Further citing Gwen's role among Connor and Gunn in the comic series triangle, he observed the unrelenting use of women as a device for men to shore up.|$|E

25|$|Olivier Blanchard {{suggests}} that a fiscal union in the EZ can mitigate devastating effects of the single currency on the EZ peripheral countries. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> the currency bloc will not work perfectly even if a fiscal transfer system is built, because, he argues, the fundamental issue about competitiveness adjustment is not tackled. The problem is, since the EZ peripheral countries do not have their own currencies, {{they are forced to}} adjust their economies by decreasing their wages instead of devaluation.|$|R
25|$|Muslims {{have all}} the will and the {{physical}} capability which can solve their problems and to participate to influence events {{in the world and}} face the colonial and intellectual invasion, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> the real destitution is in their understanding of the laws of changing themselves and their communities, as they usually claim their rights, rather than performing their duties, and are concerned with having a state rather than the establishing the society, they adopt the pattern of violence and coercion not the scientific method and persuasion...|$|R
500|$|Williams {{has stated}} that the game's events are open to interpretation. Many {{different}} theories have been discussed by the development staff. Davis described the game's pacing as [...] "deliberate", <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> there are moments where the pacing slows down significantly and allows the player {{to learn more about}} the game's story through inspecting environmental objects. The city of Dubai is filled with graffiti, which is used to give players information regarding the factions and the backstory. According to Yager, the graffiti was designed to give players a perspective that is different from the main game, and to help make the location more realistic. The team also hoped to make players feel lost when playing the game. As a result, the team added hallucination to the game. The team hoped that by using hallucination as a plot device, they could create a snowball effect and engage players more fully in the story as they complete the game. These hallucinations sometimes occur through the subtext, in which players may not realize their presence. Williams added that having subtext is important, and that the [...] "best stories are the ones that have stuff hidden in them". The game fades to black when the game transitions from one scene to another, and it fades to white when Walker is hallucinating or otherwise deceiving himself.|$|E
500|$|... "Yeah!" [...] was lauded by {{contemporary}} critics for its production. Jem Aswad of Entertainment Weekly called it [...] "irresistibly crunked-out", adding, [...] "the ensuing track glides smoothly between club-friendly hip-hop soul and ballads." [...] Laura Sinagra of Rolling Stone {{commented that the}} song [...] "creates sensual panic by combining Usher's jumpy attacks with Jon's sublime, frayed beats." [...] Jon Caramanica of Blender noted that [...] "Yeah!" [...] is the first song to mix [...] "mainstream R and menacing Southern crunk." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine said that the song has brought Usher to a [...] "whole new level of crunk." [...] Andy Kellman of Allmusic described the song as a [...] "crunk-meets-R foundation" [...] which features an [...] "instantly addictive eight-note keyboard vamp". He added that the song is [...] "so absorbing that Ludacris' 1500th guest verse floats by with little notice." [...] Matt Cibula of PopMatters characterized the song as a [...] "full-fledged club über-crunk salacious" [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> it fails to be a [...] "club banger". Steve Jones of USA Today referred to [...] "Yeah!" [...] as a [...] "club-rattling" [...] song {{from a combination of}} [...] "Atlanta's vibrant music scene", Lil Jon's [...] "insistent beats" [...] and Ludacris' [...] "racy rhymes". Robert Hilburn of Los Angeles Times described [...] "Yeah!" [...] as a [...] "raucous tale of dance-floor seduction" [...] which pop musician Michael Jackson would have produced in 2004, if he [...] "still had the old Thriller magic".|$|E
500|$|Brian D. Schiller of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} album {{three and a}} half out of five stars. He stated that [...] "the album is at best another good step toward their once great state and not a full return to it. What's true, though, is that it's the group's best full album since Vitalogy." [...] Noel Murray of The A.V. Club ranked the album B+, {{considering}} it the [...] "tightest Pearl Jam album in a decade", describing the album as a comeback [...] "filled with straight-up, riff-a-riffic rock songs." [...] Mojo gave the album three out of five stars. The review said, [...] "elf-titled with good reason: Pearl Jam sound reborn, vital." [...] Kyle Anderson of Spin gave the album three out of five stars. He said that [...] "rather than rage against the time machine, they seem to be having fun... Pearl Jam are taking themselves less seriously, and it fits them like a snug flannel shirt." [...] Mat Snow of The Guardian also gave the album three out of five stars. In the review he stated that Vedder [...] "musters absolute conviction in writing and singing lyrics of male teenage angst." [...] Snow observed, [...] "And though few of these 13 numbers have the drama of tracks by the Who or Led Zeppelin, from whom the band draw much of their style, Pearl Jam play like men on a mission." [...] David Raposa of Pitchfork called it the [...] "most consistent effort the group's released since its second album," [...] <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> it [...] "gets pretty boring pretty... quick." ...|$|E

He has argued that radical Islam shares elements with religious cults, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> it is partly based on a shared [...] "Islamic identity myth" [...] born out of the reality of war.

5000|$|In {{his letter}} to the church at Thessalonica, Paul writes, [...] "The Lord himself will descend from heaven... and the dead in Christ will rise first."

[...] Th. 4:16-17 The rising of those who are still alive to join the resurrected dead is known as the Rapture. Some believe this passage implies that Paul believed that the return of Jesus, the Resurrection, and the Rapture would happen simultaneously.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Medved gave Everybody's Fine {{two stars}} (out of four), calling the film [...] "...bleak, deeply depressive, and utterly depressing..." [...] <b>But</b> <b>he</b> also <b>added</b> <b>that</b> [...] "DeNiro's acting is intense and moving as always." ...|$|R
500|$|Vedder called [...] "Gonna See My Friend" [...] a [...] "drug song," [...] but {{elaborated}} {{that the}} song is about {{going to see a}} friend to stay off drugs, and he stated that [...] "Got Some" [...] is about a [...] "drug dealer," [...] but added what the drug the dealer is selling is actually a great rock song. [...] "Johnny Guitar", described by Vedder as [...] "almost an Elvis Costello homage", had its lyrics inspired by a collage of album covers that is pasted on the bathroom wall of the band's rehearsal space. Vedder noticed the album cover for Johnny [...] "Guitar" [...] Watson's 1979 album, What the Hell Is This?, and imagined a man who becomes attracted to one of the various women on the cover and then wonders why this woman would rather be one of Watson's many girlfriends instead of his only one. Vedder described [...] "Just Breathe" [...] as [...] "as close to a love song as we've ever gotten," [...] and said that the subject of {{the song is}} the happiest times of people's lives when they should just take in the moment and [...] "breathe for a minute." [...] He also said that [...] "Unthought Known" [...] concerns the human psyche, and [...] "Supersonic" [...] is about the love for music. According to Vedder, [...] "Speed of Sound" [...] is a song taken {{from the perspective of a}} man who is still sitting in a bar after everyone else has left, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> even though the song is sad it became more [...] "confident" [...] when played with the whole band. He said [...] "Force of Nature" [...] is [...] "about the strength of one person in the relationship, when they can withstand some of the faults in another." [...] "The End" [...] has been described as an [...] "aching love song." ...|$|E
2500|$|Critic Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{stated that}} [...] "the savoury, serio-comic tang of the Coens' film-making style is recognisably present, as is their predilection for the weirdness of hotels and motels". <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> they [...] "have found {{something}} that has heightened and deepened their identity as film-makers: {{a real sense of}} seriousness, a sense that their offbeat Americana and gruesome and surreal comic contortions can really be {{more than the sum of}} their parts".|$|E
2500|$|In 1969, Luciani was {{cautious}} of {{de facto}} relationships as a lesser evil to divorce.

To remedy that, some propose a divorce, which, conversely, would aggravate this. But some remedy outside of divorce, you can't really find?

5000|$|During the Cold War, Rousseau {{was criticized}} for his {{association}} with nationalism and its attendant abuses, for example in [...] This {{came to be known}} among scholars as the [...] "totalitarian thesis". Political scientist J.S. Maloy states that [...] "the twentieth century added Nazism and Stalinism to Jacobinism on the list of horrors for which Rousseau could be blamed. … Rousseau was considered to have advocated just the sort of invasive tampering with human nature which the totalitarian regimes of mid-century had tried to instantiate." [...] <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> [...] "The totalitarian thesis in Rousseau studies has, by now, been discredited as an attribution of real historical influence." ...|$|R
5000|$|James Manheim in {{his review}} for All Music says that [...] "This {{certainly}} isn't an authentic performance of medieval music." [...] <b>but,</b> <b>he</b> <b>add</b> <b>that</b> [...] "In a way, it gets listeners closer than almost anybody else {{to the time when}} vertical sonorities in European music were new, and for those who have never heard it, it's time to begin."In The New York Times's Classical Top Music Recordings of 2014, James R. Oestreich says that [...] "So varied are the sources {{that it is hard to}} find a theme or even a common thread. But the enchanting vocal style and sonority that the female trio has evolved unifies the whole beautifully." ...|$|R

2500|$|On February 28, 1935, Furtwängler met Goebbels, {{who wanted}} to keep Furtwängler in Germany, since he {{considered}} him, like Richard Strauss and Hans Pfitzner, a [...] "national treasure". Goebbels asked him to pledge allegiance publicly to the new regime. Furtwängler refused. Goebbels then proposed that Furtwängler acknowledge publicly that Hitler {{was in charge of}} cultural policy. Furtwängler accepted: Hitler was a dictator and controlled everything in the country. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> it must be clear that he {{wanted nothing to do with}} the policy and that he would remain as a non-political artist, without any official position. The agreement was reached.

During the hearings, {{when asked if he}} could make a decision as Secretary of Defense that would be adverse to the interests of General Motors, Wilson answered affirmatively. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> <b>that</b> he could not conceive of such a situation [...] "because for years I thought what was good for our country was good for General Motors, and vice versa".

25|$|Many authorities, {{including}} the Rema, note the custom {{that the father}} of a firstborn should fast on his child's behalf until the child reaches halakhic adulthood. The Rema rules that if the father is a firstborn himself, the mother should fast on behalf of the child. The Mateh Moshe and Maharil dispute this and rule in such a scenario that the mother need not fast. The Magen Avraham rules that it is appropriate to follow the lenient opinion if fasting causes the mother excessive discomfort or if she is pregnant or nursing, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> <b>that</b> a mother who begins following the former opinion must maintain that custom and fast in subsequent years.|$|R
