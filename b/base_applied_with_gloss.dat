30|$|The {{treatment}} {{generates a}} film at the papers’ surface. The overall optical impression {{is closely related}} to the amount of nanocellulose applied: From approximately 2 % nanocellulose, slight (BNC) or very slight (NFC) hazes are clearly visible and become much more apparent with increasing amounts. Thus, letters appear more veiled with 8 % NFC or 15 % BNC. The signs of BNC look shinier when a higher amount is applied, whereas the films of NFC occur more as matt, white hazes without gloss. This is an important advantage of NFC. Besides the amount <b>applied,</b> the <b>gloss</b> <b>with</b> BNC is increased by using the film applicator.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-In this paper, we {{performed}} the comparative analysis of power consumption of array multiplier circuit implemented with two adder modules and Self Adjustable Voltage level circuit (SVL). The adder modules chosen were 10 transistor- Static Energy Recovery CMOS adder and 8 transistor CMOS (SERF) circuits. At first, the circuit was simulated with adder modules without applying the SVL circuit. And secondly, SVL circuit was {{incorporated in the}} adder modules for simulation. In the multiplier architecture chosen, less power consumption was observed being consumed by the SERF adder <b>based</b> multipliers <b>applied</b> <b>with</b> SVL circuit. ...|$|R
40|$|Muons {{decaying}} in {{the water}} volume of a Cherenkov detector of the Pierre Auger Observatory provide a useful calibration point at low energy. Using the digitized waveform continuously recorded by the electronics of each tank, we have devised a simple method to extract the charge spectrum of the Michel electrons, whose typical signal is about 1 / 8 of a crossing vertical muon. This procedure, moreover, allows continuous monitoring of the detector operation and of its water level. We have checked the procedure with high statistics on a test tank at the Observatory <b>base</b> and <b>applied</b> <b>with</b> success on the whole array.

40|$|In this paper, we {{performed}} the comparative analysis of stand-by leakage (when the circuit is idle), delay and dynamic power (when the circuit switches) {{of the three}} different parallel digital multiplier circuits implemented with two adder modules and Self Adjustable Voltage level circuit (SVL). The adder modules chosen were 28 transistor-conventional CMOS adder and 10 transistor- Static Energy Recovery CMOS adder (SERF) circuits. The multiplier modules chosen were 4 Bits Array, 4 bits Carry Save and 4 Bits Baugh Wooley multipliers. At first, the circuits were simulated with adder modules without applying the SVL circuit. And secondly, SVL circuit was incorporated in the adder modules for simulation. In all the multiplier architectures chosen, less standby leakage power was observed being consumed by the SERF adder <b>based</b> multipliers <b>applied</b> <b>with</b> SVL circuit. The stand-by leakage power dissipation is 1. 16 µwatts in Bits array multiplier <b>with</b> SERF Adder <b>applied</b> <b>with</b> SVL vs. 1. 39 µwatts in the same multiplier with CMOS 28 T Adder <b>applied</b> <b>with</b> SVL circuit.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to compare microhardness, {{roughness}} and micromorphology of the examined materials of a newly developed glass carbomer dental filling material to two different resin modified glass ionomers and a glass ionomer dental filling material. Specimens tested were prepared from a glass carbomer without gloss (Glass Carbomer, GCP), a glass carbomer (Glass Carbomer, GCP) <b>with</b> <b>gloss,</b> two different resin modified glass ionomers (Fuji II LC, GC and Riva LC, SDI) and a glass ionomer (Equia, GC). Seven specimens of each material were prepared according to manufacturer’s recommendations. After setting, samples were polished and stored in 37 ◦C distilled water for 24 h. Indentation microhardness of examined restorative materials was measured using the Vickers indenters. In addition surface roughness of the materials was measured using surface profilemeter. Surface morphology was analyzed by using scanning electron microscopy. There was a significant difference in microhardness and roughness between the restorative materials (p < 0. 05). The highest microhardness was measured for Equia and lowest for glass carbomer <b>with</b> <b>gloss.</b> The roughness was fully definite for the glass carbomer <b>with</b> <b>gloss</b> and indefinite for the glass carbomer without gloss. Small cracks and voids were observed in all groups. High viscosity glass ionomer cement Equia exhibits the high physical strength than RMGIC.
