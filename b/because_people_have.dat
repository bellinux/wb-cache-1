25|$|Cape Town {{implemented}} a water conservation strategy {{aimed at reducing}} the use of water by using treated sewage effluent instead of fresh water for irrigation and industrial purposes. As {{a result of this}} strategy, and <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> become more aware of the value of water and are trying harder to conserve it, the council is experiencing a 25% saving.|$|E
25|$|This occurs where {{birth and}} death rates are both low, leading to a total {{population}} stable. Death rates are low {{for a number of}} reasons, primarily lower rates of diseases and higher production of food. The birth rate is low <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> more opportunities to choose if they want children; this is made possible by improvements in contraception or women gaining more independence and work opportunities. The DTM is only a suggestion about the future population levels of a country, not a prediction.|$|E
25|$|It is {{held that}} the cause of {{sickness}} is soul theft, in which someone (perhaps an enemy, whether human or a spirit) has stolen the soul of the sick person. It takes a spiritual healer to retrieve the stolen soul. The person remains alive <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> multiple souls, so stealing the appropriate soul causes illness or a moribund state rather than immediate death. According to another variant among Ammassalik in East Greenland, the joints of the body have their own small souls, the loss of which causes pain.|$|E
5000|$|In Fortune (magazine) in 2015, Popcorn said [...] "uber-cocooning, and {{now even}} bunkering" [...] were {{becoming}} prominent <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> become [...] "terrified" [...] of world conditions.|$|R
50|$|Carter {{was born}} Janis Dremann in Cleveland, Ohio. She changed {{her last name}} <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> trouble pronouncing it and {{spelling}} it, choosing her grandmother's maiden name as her new last name.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, Tuck {{ran for the}} California State Senate. He {{opened his}} {{campaign}} with a press conference at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Glendale claiming that just <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> died doesn't mean they don't still have (voting) rights.|$|R
500|$|... "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] {{became a}} Radio Disney hit, {{remaining}} at number one for 12 weeks. The song's success ultimately benefited Milian's {{career as a}} performer; she explained, [...] "I never realized that show would give me so much exposure. It's great <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> grown with me, even with that damn song. Didn’t know {{so many people were}} watching Kim Possible like that. Because of that song, it actually inspired me to do my own musical animated artist {{because a lot of people}} thought I was Kim Possible." [...] Milian has yet to perform the song live in concert but has expressed interest in recording a remix for fans. [...] "Call Me, Beep Me" [...] was the first song Lerios and Gabriel wrote together, and the songwriting duo has since gone on to collaborate on both scoring and writing songs for several other major television networks and programs.|$|E
500|$|It also {{revealed}} that a mixtape, titled Welcome to the New Administration, was available for download for free on the FriendsOrEnemies website. The mixtape contained several snippets of new Fall Out Boy tracks, {{as well as new}} music from other bands such as Gym Class Heroes, Cobra Starship, and Panic! at the Disco. However none of the titles were confirmed for Folie à Deux. It also featured a song titled [...] "America's Sweethearts" [...] which was eventually confirmed for the album but with an alternate spelling, [...] "America's Suitehearts". The band confirmed that it intended to release the mixtape in conjunction with the [...] "Citizens" [...] campaign, and felt that it was relevant to not only the themes of the album, but the 2008 election as well. Wentz explained [...] "The whole campaign is part of the record and people can call it whatever they want, but the mixtape was part of that campaign, and we'll see what happens from here...In creating this autocratic organization, we created a democratic campaign, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> made it go the direction they wanted it to go." ...|$|E
500|$|The most {{interesting}} {{part of that}} {{for me is that}} audiences seem very unwilling to believe the stuff that Teddy [...] says at the end and yet why? I think its <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> spent the entire film looking at Leonard's photograph of Teddy, with the caption: [...] "Don't believe his lies." [...] That image really stays in people's heads, and they still prefer to trust that image even after we make it very clear that Leonard's visual recollection is completely questionable. It was quite surprising, and it wasn't planned. What was always planned was that we don't ever step completely outside Leonard's head, and that we keep the audience in that interpretive mode of trying to analyze what they want to believe or not. For me, the crux of the movie is that the one guy who might actually be the authority on the truth of what happened is played by Joe Pantoliano ... who is so untrustworthy, especially given the baggage he carries in from his other movies: he's already seen by audiences as this character actor who's always unreliable. I find it very frightening, really, the level of uncertainty and malevolence Joe brings to the film.|$|E
50|$|In 1981, October 17 and 18, British {{rock band}} Queen {{played for the}} Mexican Audience. The first of two concerts was the most significant, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> broke a gate of the stadium, {{and there were many}} excesses <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> not seen an event like this before. People threw many objects to stage: shoes, batteries, food, etc. And a pantyhose filled with dust was threw to the Guitar Player Brian May.|$|R
5000|$|Theodosios Alexander, Sc.D., is the Director of Interdisciplinary Research Collaborations at Saint Louis University. In 2001, Alexander {{moved from}} the United States to the United Kingdom and changed his legal name from Theodosios Korakianitis to Theodosios Alexander <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{difficulty}} pronouncing his family name. Today, he uses both names professionally but publishes as [...] "T. Korakianitis." ...|$|R
5000|$|Nanjing North Railway Station (...) is {{a railway}} station in Nanjing's Pukou District {{which was built}} in 1914. Located near the {{northern}} shore of the Yangtze River, it was a busy station <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{to get off the}} train and cross Yangtze River by ferry, and to resume their journey from the Nanjing West Railway Station on the southern bank of the river.|$|R
2500|$|Crick {{occasionally}} {{expressed his}} views on eugenics, usually in private letters. For example, Crick advocated a form of positive eugenics in which wealthy parents would be encouraged to have more children. He once remarked, [...] "In the long run, it is unavoidable that society will begin {{to worry about the}} character of the next generation... It is not a subject at the moment which we can tackle easily <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> so many religious beliefs and until we have a more uniform view of ourselves I think it would be risky to try and do anything in the way of eugenics... I would be astonished if, in the next 100 or 200years, society did not come round to the view {{that they would have to}} try to improve the next generation in some extent or one way or another." ...|$|E
60|$|This text, I believe {{more and}} more every day, {{is one of the}} most {{important}} ones in the whole Bible; and just at this time it is more important for us than ever, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> forgotten it more than ever.|$|E

50|$|The {{tour was}} so {{successful}} that a second tour of Freer's films took place in 1902. The second tour was sponsored by Sir Clifford Sifton, Canadian Minister of the Interior, who was eager to promote immigration to the Canadian west, especially those from English speaking countries. The second trip was not as successful a recruiting device <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> heard that Freer had downplayed Manitoba's mosquito problem and cold winters.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you mean, then? I am {{not going}} to marry the Duke of Omnium because of his attention,--nor any one else. If you mean, sir, after the other {{inquiries}} you have done me the honour to make, to throw it in my face now, that I have--have in any way rendered myself unworthy of the position of your wife <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been civil and kind to me in my sorrow, you are a greater dastard than I took you to be. Tell me at once, sir, whom you mean." ...|$|E

50|$|The test is {{of special}} {{interest}} <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> a hard time solving it in most scenarios but can usually solve it correctly in certain contexts. In particular, {{researchers have found that}} the puzzle is readily solved when the imagined context is policing a social rule.|$|E
50|$|What {{this did}} to the economy {{at the time was}} notable. It {{increased}} wages steadily over the period of time and it also increased population <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> the wages for standard living. This {{is an example of a}} positive technology shock, where it increases national and disposable income, and also increases the labor force. The Industrial Revolution also provided a much more efficient way to produce goods which lead to less labor-intensive work.|$|R

50|$|Corn prices halved {{at the end}} of the wars, when {{trade with}} Europe resumed. The Corn Laws of 1815 were {{intended}} to protect the price of domestic grain, but this only served to keep prices high and depressed the domestic market for manufactured goods, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> to use all their money to buy food. Likewise, European countries which relied on exporting corn to Britain in order to buy British manufactured goods were no longer able to do so.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the public}} and recreationalists must be educated about the threat of {{spreading}} invasive species. <b>Because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> been known to release exotic pets into their local waters, and take their boats from location to location, {{they need to be}} aware of the risks involved with these behaviors.|$|E
50|$|Users {{are able}} to quote other {{messages}} by copying them and pasting them into a new message. A quote shows the message, the original sender and the timestamp of the original message.

50|$|Tarapur is a multi-religious {{town with}} a {{population}} of roughly 35,000. The economy is based on farming, trade, and services. Major crops are wheat, rice, chickpeas, and millet. Some of the neighbourhoods are almost empty <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> migrated to Indian cities or abroad for work in businesses and professional fields.|$|E
50|$|<b>Because</b> <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{begun to}} claim that Garrett unfairly ambushed Bonney, Garrett {{felt the need to}} tell his side of the story. In response, Garrett called upon his friend, {{journalist}} Marshall Upson, to ghostwrite a book for him. The collaboration led to the book The Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid, which was first published in April 1882. Although only a few copies sold following its release, the book eventually became a reference for historians who later wrote about Bonney's life.|$|R
50|$|The Dragon Festival {{was causing}} a {{national}} media stir, firstly because banning a fiesta in Andalucia was simply unheard of but mostly <b>because</b> two <b>people</b> <b>had</b> {{died at the}} festival in 2002.|$|R
5000|$|The term uussuomalainen also {{describes}} {{the descendants of}} immigrants better than the term [...] "immigrant", <b>because</b> these <b>people</b> <b>have</b> in many cases been {{born and raised in}} Finland to parents from other countries.|$|R

5000|$|In 1998, Einar {{teamed up}} with Hilmar Örn and former Sugarcubes drummer Sigtryggur [...] "Siggi" [...] Baldursson as Grindverk. [...] "It's dance music for people who cannot dance. It'll {{probably}} be instrumental too. It's not <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> criticised me, I just don't think I've written anything I want to sing." [...] Grindverk released a single album, Gesundheit Von K, on the British-based Fat Cat Records.|$|E
50|$|Constitutional patriotism holds a {{political}} order accountable <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>have</b> {{the choice to}} be constitutionally patriotic. People will only feel pride in {{a political}} order they feel warrants the emotion. The diversity of states in the European Union also makes a constitutional bond an appealing style of unity. Similarly, {{in the context of}} a history of wars, persecutions, genocide, and ethnic cleansing, states may choose to gather behind a constitution at the supranational level.|$|E
50|$|The drug {{is being}} {{considered}} for its therapeutic value in aging adults <b>because</b> elderly <b>people</b> <b>have</b> much lower levels of growth hormone and less lean muscle mass, which can result in weakness and frailty.|$|R
