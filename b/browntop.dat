40|$|A low {{occurrence}} of white clover in pastures contributes to soil nitrogen (N) deficiency {{and a low}} quality feed for stock. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} competition for soil phosphorus (P) from roots of <b>browntop</b> {{plays an important role in}} determining the distribution of white clover in hill country swards. However, competition for soil P between roots of <b>browntop</b> and white clover has not been studied separately from other factors known to affect the growth and persistence of white clover (e. g., soil moisture, grazing management, shoot interferences (shading and physical impedance), and non-competitive root interferences). In hill country pastures, P level (phosphorus fertilisers), and defoliation (grazing management), are the main factors that can be changed by farmers to alter pasture botanical composition. The high cost of superphosphate has limited the potential of farmers to manipulate pastures using fertiliser applications. Therefore, it is important to know whether roots of <b>browntop</b> compete with roots of white clover for soil P, and whether a low supply of soil P will contribute to more severe competition from <b>browntop</b> roots. The possibility of non-competitive interferences occurring between roots of <b>browntop</b> and white clover must also be considered. How defoliation alters the balance of P acquisition between roots of <b>browntop</b> and white clover needs to be determined. Three techniques were employed to examine the nature of root interferences occurring between <b>browntop</b> and white clover: plant strategies; dual P isotope labelling; and a more traditional competitive settings trial using aerial partitions. Plant growth and root interferences were studied at a range of levels of soil P supply. Responses of growth and phosphorus uptake of <b>browntop</b> and white clover to increasing soil P supply were examined first, in the glasshouse, by growing monocultures of <b>browntop</b> and white clover in pots. Two mini-sward trials (one at deficient soil P supply, the other at adequate to luxury soil P supply) were carried out in the glasshouse to allow examination of root interactions (without shoot interactions). The basis of the experimental design was to determine the relative amounts of phosphorus- 32 and - 33 absorbed by a central row of plants (either <b>browntop</b> or white clover) from two adjacent soil spaces, one dominated by white clover roots, the other by <b>browntop</b> roots. 32 P was injected into the soil on one side of the central row of plants, and 33 P into the other side. 32 p and 33 p uptake was assessed by harvesting the shoots of the central plants, and counting the two isotopes. The competitive settings type trial compared the growth and P uptake of a single central plant in a small pot (no interference with other plants) with a central plant in a larger pot grown with roots associated with roots of plants of the same species (intraspecific association), or of the other species (interspecific association). Shoots of the central plant was separated from the shoots of outer plants by an aerial partition. The growth of <b>browntop</b> and white clover, and the nature of root interferences occurring within and between the two species was dependent on the level of soil P supply. However, the higher root density and specific root length (SRL) of <b>browntop</b> compared with white clover appeared to be the most important factor determining the success of <b>browntop</b> at all levels of soil P supply, regardless of whether or not <b>browntop</b> was grown with white clover. According to the plant strategy theory of Grime, <b>browntop</b> was found to be a stress tolerant plant. At low levels of P supply, the lower growth rate of <b>browntop</b> compared with white clover would be an important factor contributing to the dominance of <b>browntop</b> in hill country pastures. At adequate to luxury levels of soil P supply, shoot growth of <b>browntop</b> was more responsive than white clover, and <b>browntop</b> was capable of luxury consumption of P. The high growth rate and large demand for P contributed to the competitiveness of <b>browntop</b> at high P supply. However, the lower demand for P by white clover, and the high P supply may have enabled white clover to avoid competition with <b>browntop.</b> On unamended subsoil, <b>browntop</b> reduced P acquisition by white clover roots, and had a greater P uptake in the presence of roots of white clover than with roots of other <b>browntop</b> plants. Therefore, evidence of root competition for soil P from <b>browntop</b> with white clover was found. The competitive effect of <b>browntop</b> appeared to be due to <b>browntop</b> decreasing the availability of P in the soil, explained by browntop's ability to acquire more radioactive P from the soil than white clover. At low P supply (subsoil), P application, but not defoliation of <b>browntop,</b> reduced the competitiveness of <b>browntop.</b> At adequate P supply, the ability of <b>browntop</b> to acquire P was reduced by defoliation. The effect of defoliation was rapid (four days), and <b>browntop</b> was able to acquire P isotope to higher concentrations in the shoots than when undefoliated. Possibly the reduction of root competitiveness of <b>browntop</b> may be short-lived. Some interference, other than root competition, was occurring at intermediate to luxury levels of soil P supply, and may have masked the competitive effects of <b>browntop.</b> White clover appeared to benefit for P acquisition from growing with <b>browntop,</b> due to greater local root density compared with when growing with other white clover plants. Therefore, <b>browntop</b> and white clover appeared to gain mutual benefit for P acquisition from the presence of roots of the other species, and the competitive effects of <b>browntop</b> were not of overriding importance. The possibility of autotoxicity of white clover on its own root growth was discussed in relation to rhizosphere acidity effects on the toxicity of phenolics. At adequate to luxury levels of soil P supply, neither undefoliated <b>browntop</b> nor undefoliated white clover benefited from defoliation of adjacently growing white clover plants. However, at lower P supply, defoliation of white clover led to an increased P isotope acquisition by nearby <b>browntop</b> plants. Therefore, defoliation reduced the demand for soil P by white clover. Roots of <b>browntop</b> were not as tolerant of defoliation as white clover. In the field, the mat forming behaviour of <b>browntop,</b> physically impeding the growth of white clover and shading white clover stolons, would reduce the severity of competition for soil P between roots of <b>browntop</b> and white clover. Overall, root competition for P from <b>browntop</b> with white clover was found not to be as important as previously thought. The use of several experimental techniques allowed a clearer picture of the interferences that occur between <b>browntop</b> and white clover to be obtained. The nature of root interference changed with increasing P supply. The responses of <b>browntop</b> and white clover to increasing P supply was found to be enlightening when the plant strategy theory of Grime was used to compare <b>browntop</b> and white clover. However, the dual P isotope technique found plant interferences that were not detected by the other methods used (P response and competitive settings trial), and allowed interferences that were occurring simultaneously to be elucidated...|$|E
40|$|The farming of {{foothill}} {{country is}} carried out over {{the entire length of}} the South Island. The area consists of those lower hills and undulating clay downs most of which are ploughable. It is situated between the plains or lowlands of the eastern coastline- and the high, steep, unploughable tussock, scrub, and mountainous country which extends westward to the Main Divide. It is commonly known as the <b>browntop</b> belt on account of this dominant species, which forms the main soil coverage. The area of the <b>browntop</b> belt in Canterbury alone comprises some ¾ million acres. The altitude varies from a few hundred feet to some 1, 600 to 2600 ft. The rainfall is variable. In the higher altitudes it is as high as 30 ins. to 50 ins. Winters in these higher altitudes are severe and long with late spring growth. Also occasional falls of snow are experienced most winters. Under the conditions of high rainfall cultivation is difficult and because of its clay nature the soil remains saturated for long periods.

40|$|Five "contaminations", where faeces {{containing}} Trichostrongylus colubriformis {{eggs were}} deposited on pasture and serially recovered, {{were used to}} compare the rate of decline of faecal mass and larval development. In the first three contaminations, faeces from a common source were deposited on swards of <b>browntop</b> (Agrostis capillaris cv Grasslands Muster), ryegrass (Lolium perenne cv Grassland Nui), white clover (Trifolium pratense cv Grassland Tahora), or onto bare ground in the late spring, summer or autumn. The last two contaminations were done on the north facing aspect or south facing aspect of hill country pastures in summer and autumn. Number of free-living nematodes (first- and second-stage larvae (L 1 and L 2) and soil dwelling nematodes) and third stage larvae (L 3) recovered from faeces were counted. In spring there was a significant (P< 0. 01) effect of sward type on the mass of faeces remaining, with greatest mass remaining on <b>browntop</b> and ryegrass 28 days later, and less on bare ground and white clover. In summer there were more (P< 0. 05) faeces remaining on <b>browntop</b> than on other herbages which had little faeces remaining and which did not differ one from another. In autumn there was a rapid decline in faecal mass. All faeces were gone from white clover and ryegrass swards by day 10 and from <b>browntop</b> and bare ground by day 14. The number of free-living nematodes did not differ markedly between seasons, ranging from 5 to 8. 5 % of eggs deposited. The number of L 3 recovered was low in spring (? 0. 4 % of eggs deposited) and did not differ between swards. In summer, more (P< 0. 05) L 3 were recovered from faeces deposited on swards of ryegrass and white clover than from bare ground or <b>browntop.</b> Most L 3 were recovered from days 7 to 14 (? 1. 3 % of eggs deposited). In the autumn, low numbers of L 3 were recovered from <b>browntop</b> on day 3 and ryegrass on day 7 (0. 2 % of eggs deposited) with virtually no L 3 recovered from faeces placed on white clover or bare ground. There were significant (P< 0. 001) effects of aspect on the amount of faecal mass remaining in both summer and autumn with less faeces remaining on the south facing aspect than on the north. This was particularly evident during the summer when virtually all of the faeces were intact on the north facing aspect but only 40 % was remaining on the south on day 28. In the autumn, while faeces were completely gone from both aspects by day 28 but there were less (P< 0. 05) faeces remaining on the south facing aspect from days 3 to 18 than from the north. There was no aspect effect in either season on the number of free-living nematodes recovered which averaged 8 - 11 % of eggs deposited. In both seasons a greater number of L 3 were recovered from faeces on the south facing aspect than on the north, particularly 3 - 10 days after faecal deposition. In summer the rise in L 3 recovered in faeces was more rapid on south facing aspect than on the north but both attained a maximum level of ? 4 % of eggs deposited. In autumn on day 3 there was a rapid rise on south facing aspect to ? 21 % of eggs deposited followed by a gradual decline on day 10 while on the north facing aspect numbers of L 3 recovered only attained 10 % of eggs deposited...|$|E

Total recovery of ¹⁵N-labelled nitrogen fertilizer was approximately 100 % when fertilizer was applied to the grass seed crops in spring. At harvest in year 1, grass straw and seed contained 34 – 47 % and 6 – 15 % of the applied N respectively; 27 – 35 % remained in the soil (0 – 150 mm depth). Recovery of ¹⁵N in straw and soil was higher in fescue and ryegrass than in <b>browntop,</b> but recovery in roots was lower. At harvest in year 2, most of the 15 N was present in the soil (30 – 37 %) with only small amounts in the seed (0 · 7 – 1 · 0 %), straw (3 · 6 – 4 · 9 %) and roots (5 · 2 – 12 · 7 %). In year 3, 2 · 5 – 3 · 5 % of the residual ¹⁵N was recovered in the wheat and 18 – 26 % in soil. Losses of ¹⁵N were minimal until ploughing after the second harvest, when there was an apparent loss of 11 – 35 % of the fertilizer N applied. Losses were not directly associated with the fertilizer but indirectly following release of fertilizer N previously immobilized in plant roots and soil microorganisms. Small losses also occurred directly from autumn-applied N, probably through leaching. Despite these losses, overall there was an accumulation of fertilizer N in the soil organic pool, suggesting that ryegrass fescue and <b>browntop</b> seed crops have a role in contributing to the N fertility of the soil...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. —Continuing {{difficulty}} in the successful natural regeneration of economically important oak species (Quercus spp.) on highly productive sites {{has led to}} considerable research {{regarding the use of}} artificial oak regeneration to ensure recruitment of oak as an important component of future stands.

40|$|An {{experiment}} was established within the Lees Valley (400 m a. s. l.), Canterbury out of low producing, <b>browntop</b> dominant grassland. The {{aim was to}} quantify dry matter (DM) production of improved perennial grasses in relation to temperature and nitrogen inputs. Ten grass monocultures were established in 2006. For the first year, annual DM yield ranged from 4. 2 t/ha (timothy) to 10. 6 t/ha (‘Aries’ perennial ryegrass). On 15 / 8 / 2007 either 0 or 150 kg N/ha was applied to half of each plot. At {{the end of the}} spring 2007, yields were 1. 3 t/ha (‘Aries’ no N fertiliser) to 5. 5 t/ha (‘Revolution’ perennial ryegrass with N fertiliser). Yield responses ranged from 8. 3 to 20. 1 kg DM/kg N applied with an average spring growth rate of 3. 2 kg DM/ha/°Cd for grass with no N and 8. 8 kg DM/ha/°Cd for the N fertilised grasses, using a base temperature of 3 °C. Results highlighted the need to maximise spring growth in summer dry environments, especially when there is a large potential response to the addition of N. Cocksfoot and tall fescue produced more DM in summer dry conditions indicating some opportunity to spread production through the year, in regions with highly variable summer rainfall...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} on the Liverpool Plains (30 o 43 ’– 31 o 44 ’S; 149 o 40 ’– 150 o 41 ’E), North Western Slopes of NSW, to determine the original boundaries of the naturally-treeless grasslands, to determine reasons for the lack of woody vegetation on these areas, and to assess the status of Austrostipa aristiglumis (Plains Grass), a species that is today commonly dominant on the few remaining remnant grassland areas and is commonly assumed to characterise the original grassland community. The original tree line boundaries were reconstructed using NSW Lands Department survey portion plans and other historical records. The lack of woody vegetation was attributed primarily to a combination of fine-textured soil, climate and topography restricting the availability of water below the grass root zone, with waterlogging and deep soil cracking possibly playing minor roles. Published and anecdotal evidence and landholder experience indicate that the Austrostipa aristiglumis dominated remnants are probably a relatively recent anthropogenic feature, a consequence of post-settlement management practices.

40|$|During {{the past}} century, Japanese stiltgrass or Nepalese <b>browntop</b> (Microstegium vimineum) has {{expanded}} its range from a single known location near Knoxville, Tennessee to 16 eastern states extending from Texas to New York (Barden 1987, Fairbrothers and Gray 1972, Redman 1995). This rapidly spreading annual grass is capable of producing up to 1, 000 seeds per plant, which are spread by water along natural or man-made corridors {{as well as by}} pedestrian or animal traffic and road grading. It mainly invades disturbed sites in forest environments, including roadsides, stream banks, roadside drainages and disturbed sites in the forest interior, where it can constrain forest regeneration and replace native plant species (Gibson and others 2002). During summer 2003, we assessed the effect of Japanese stiltgrass on floristic diversity {{and the extent to which}} stiltgrass removal influenced that diversity at a study site in Rothcrock State Forest of central Pennsylvania. To remove the invasive, we applied four herbicides with different levels of selectivity. We hypothesized that treatments that would only control annual grasses would result in the highest post-removal plant diversity. We tested the following herbicides and rates: sethoxydim at 0. 28 lbs/acre (0. 31 kg/ha), fenoxaprop at 0. 08 lbs/acre (0. 09 kg/ha), imazapic at 0. 09 lb/acre (0. 1 kg/ha), and glyphosate a...|$|E
40|$|Field {{studies were}} {{conducted}} in central and south-central Texas from 2013 through 2015 to evaluate crop tolerance and efficacy of various preemergence herbicides alone and in combination for weed control in field corn. Acetochlor and pendimethalin alone, S-metolachlor plus mesotrione, and the three-way combination of S-metolachlor plus atrazine plus mesotrione provided the most consistent control of annual grasses including <b>browntop</b> panicum (Panicum fasciculatum L.), Texas millet (Urochloa texana L.), barnyardgrass (Echinochloa crus-galli L.), and sprawling signalgrass (Brachiaria reptans L.). Palmer amaranth [Amaranthus palmeri (S.) Wats. ] control was at least 90 % with fluthiacet-methyl plus pyroxasulfone, atrazine plus either acetochlor, alachlor, dimethenamid-P, S-metolachlor, or S-metolachlor plus mesotrione, saflufenacil plus dimethenamid-P, and S-metolachlor plus mesotrione. Hophornbeam copperleaf (Acalypha ostryifolia L.) was difficult to control; however, acetochlor, saflufenacil or pyroxasulfone alone, saflufenacil plus dimethenamid-P, and S-metolachlor plus mesotrione provided at least 90 % control. Acetochlor or saflufenacil alone, thiencarbazone-methyl plus isoxaflutole, dimethenamid-P plus atrazine, rimsulfuron plus mesotrione, and saflufenacil plus dimethenamid-P controlled common sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.) at least 90 %. Corn injury was minimal (≤ 3 %) with all herbicides. In general, corn grain yield was greatest with herbicide treatments containing more than one active ingredient compared with a single active ingredient...|$|E
40|$|The agronomic {{performance}} of Caucasian clover in high country grasslands {{was the subject}} of two experiments at Lake Heron Station, Canterbury. In the first experiment, Caucasian clover was direct drilled into an undeveloped pasture (soil pH = 5. 5; Olsen P = 7 mg/ litre) with fertilisers containing similar P and S but ± 20 kg/ha of N, in December 2011. After 11 months, shoots of Caucasian clover were small (3 mg), indicating an inoculation failure, and effects of fertilisers were not biologically meaningful. Therefore, the influence of rhizobia inoculant, superphosphate and lime on early growth of Caucasian clover was assessed using the same soil in a glasshouse. Un-inoculated plants were 13 – 24 % the size of inoculated plants and this lack of vigour was not overcome by fertilisers. In the second field experiment, an established Caucasian clover/ <b>browntop</b> pasture (soil pH = 5. 5; Olsen P = 5 mg/litre) received 0, 100, 200 and 400 kg/ha of superphosphate with 0 or 5 t/ha of lime in February 2012. Despite the high inputs, spring pasture yields 9 and 21 months after fertiliser application were low (1260 – 2400 kg DM/ ha), but the contribution of Caucasian clover was high (66 – 76 %).
