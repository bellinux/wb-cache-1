500|$|One feminist {{viewpoint}} {{sees the}} bikini uniform as objectification of women athletes. US beach volleyball player Gabrielle Reece described the bikini bottoms as uncomfortable with constant [...] "yanking and fiddling." [...] Many female beach volleyball players have suffered injuries by over-straining the abdominal muscles while {{many others have}} gone through augmentation mammoplasty to look appealing in their uniforms. Australian competitor Nicole Sanderson said about match break entertainment that [...] "it's kind of disrespectful to the female players. I'm sure the male spectators love it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> a little bit offensive." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how things REALLY work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E
500|$|The Wall was {{released}} in the UK and in the US on 30November 1979. Coinciding with its release, Waters was interviewed by veteran DJ Tommy Vance, who played the album in its entirety on BBC Radio 1. [...] Critical opinion of its content was mixed, ranging from The Village Voice critic Robert Christgau's [...] "a dumb tribulations-of-a-rock-star epic" [...] backed by [...] "kitschy minimal maximalism with sound effects and speech fragments", and Rolling Stone writer Kurt Loder's [...] "a stunning synthesis of Waters's by now familiar thematic obsessions", to Melody Makers [...] "I'm not sure whether it's brilliant or terrible, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> utterly compelling." [...] Nevertheless, the album topped the Billboard charts for 15weeks, selling over a million copies in its first two months of sales and in 1999 was certified 23x platinum. [...] It {{remains one of the}} best-selling albums of all time in the US, between 1979 and 1990 selling over 19million copies worldwide. The Wall is Pink Floyd's second best selling album after 1973's The Dark Side of the Moon. Engineer James Guthrie's efforts were rewarded in 1980 with a Grammy award for Best Engineered Recording (non-classical). According to Acclaimed Music, The Wall is the 145th most ranked record on critics' all-time lists. Rolling Stone placed it at number 87 on its 500 Greatest Albums of All Time list in 2003.|$|E

I {{wanted to}} do <b>it</b> all myself, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it's</b> a big {{proposition}} to go up against. It sure is. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> like it. I'd like nothing better than running a big hotel--not too big, but just big enough. I tell the Captain that when our mines 'pinch out' I'll go to Denver and start a hotel." ...|$|R

2500|$|I don't {{know how}} much real talent in cooking is hidden under the melange of hideous sauces which make this food and the menu a travesty of pretentious amateurism <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> all quite depressing.

2500|$|People with losses {{or other}} trauma, such as sexual abuse in {{childhood}} and adolescence may often develop this type of attachment and {{tend to agree with}} the following statements: [...] "I am somewhat uncomfortable getting close to others. I want emotionally close relationships, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> difficult to trust others completely, or to depend on them. I sometimes worry that I will be hurt if I allow myself to become too close to others." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cosmologist Alan Guth {{proposed}} a multi-verse {{solution to the}} Fermi paradox. This hypothesis uses the synchronous gauge probability distribution, {{with the result that}} young universes exceedingly outnumber older ones (by a factor of e1037 for every second of age). Therefore, averaged over all universes, universes with civilizations will almost always have just one, the first to develop. However, Guth notes [...] "Perhaps this argument explains why SETI has not found any signals from alien civilizations, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> more plausible that it is merely a symptom that the synchronous gauge probability distribution is not the right one." ...|$|E

2500|$|For the album's {{artwork and}} promotional images, Amos enlisted fashion {{photographer}} Karen Collins. [...] "I {{love the way}} [...] shoots women," [...] Amos stated about the photographer's work. [...] "It's not vulgar or demeaning, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> just sexy. They look empowered to me, and I like her style." [...] The setting for the album's artwork is a cream-colored hotel room, with various photos of Amos depicting different ideas of sensuality through images such as voyeurism and sadomasochism, both of which tie into the ideas of power explored throughout the album. Collins' images {{was used for the}} cover artwork on both single releases from the album.|$|E
2500|$|Tolstoy's anti-leftist, pro-conservative sarcasm, on {{the other}} hand, {{received}} much stick from the 'democratic' press. His [...] "Ballad With a Tendency" [...] was bitterly criticised by Saltykov-Schedrin while [...] magazine parodied it in 1872 with a verse entitled [...] "A Ballad with a Pro-Police Tendency". Shchedrin, describing {{the current state of}} Russian literature as a [...] "kingdom of scoundrels", in a letter to Aleksey Zhemchuzhnikov wrote: [...] "Add to all this the fun-and-games-seeking 'free artists' like Count A. K. Tolstoy who makes... our obscurantists' hearts beat faster with delight. I don't know about you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> painful to see how people whom I though honest, even if not very far-seeing, fight on the side of obscurantism, employing pseudo-folklorism as a weapon." ...|$|E

6000|$|Yes, <b>but</b> if <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> does me harm? It {{would be}} cowardly to run away, and {{resistance}} should be from within. Yet, {{on the other}} hand, there {{is the duty of}} giving up, wrenching oneself from all that has temptation in it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Stop!" [...] faltered Dorian Gray, [...] "stop! you bewilder me. I don't {{know what}} to say. There is some answer to you, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>find</b> <b>it.</b> Don't speak. Let me think. Or, rather, let me try not to think." ...|$|R

"Anne," [...] {{she said}} to that small personage, who was {{shelling}} peas by the spotless table and singing, [...] "Nelly of the Hazel Dell" [...] with a vigor and expression that did credit to Diana's teaching, [...] "did you see anything of my amethyst brooch?
