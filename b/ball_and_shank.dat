40|$|Impact is {{important}} to kicking performance and while differences have been found between kick distances and between preferred and non-preferred leg kicks, no work has examined junior kickers. This study examined impact characteristics of the Australian football (AF) drop punt kick for juniors and compared these data with seniors from Smith et al. (2009). Twenty one junior AF players performed a maximum distance kick. The foot, <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> were digitised from 6000 Hz video to calculate seven foot/ball parameters. Junior players produced significantly smaller foot and ball speeds but not foot to ball speed ratios compared to senior players. Work was also significantly different due to lesser force being applied to the ball. Junior players should focus on increasing foot speed and force on the ball to increase kick distance...|$|E
40|$|A {{test program}} has been {{conducted}} to measure the vibration damping of three designs of steam turbine blades. These blades were tested in their root attachments, sectioned from retired rotors. Blade loading was accomplished in {{a new type of}} blade damping test rig and damping was evaluated in the lowest tangential and axial blade modes. The test environment was room temperature air. The damping rig concept and development is presented in detail as well as results of an intensive test program. The blade designs are designated as Types A, B, and C, where Types A and B were of a fir tree root design and Type C was a <b>ball</b> <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> design. A total of 86 blades were tested and the influence of vibration amplitude, applied axial (simulated centrifugal) load, and vibration mode on damping logarithmic decrement was studied. For the designs studied, the most important findings were: a) Logarithmic decrement was inversely related to blade centrifugal load. High centrifugal loads resulted in low damping ratios. b) Logarithmic decrements varied in an almost linear manner with vibration amplitude for most tests. Constant logarithmic decrement conditions were not observed. c) The damping test rig worked well in this test series. Long LP blades may cause problems without some design changes. d) Results were highly reproducable per each blade group tested. Typical scatter was observed when comparing the results of one blade group to another. e) Changing the initial excitation amplitude did not cause any changes in the vibration decay. There is one characteristic decay trace for each centrifugal load. Test data was reduced by hand, which caused some difficulty as the damping ratio approached 1. 0. An error in the third decimal place could greatly effect the logarithmic decrement value. It is recommended that a micro-processor be used in future tests...|$|E
40|$|The kinetic {{differences}} of soccer instep kicking between the preferred and non-preferred leg were examined. The kicking motions of both legs were captured for five highly skilled players using a three-dimensional cinematographic technique at 200 Hz. The moments due to muscle force and segmental interactions were computed. Significantly greater <b>ball</b> velocity <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> angular velocity were {{achieved in the}} preferred leg. The preferred leg showed a significantly greater muscle moment {{than that of the}} non-preferred leg. No marked differences were found for the interactive moment between both legs. The results indicate that the highly skilled soccer players were able to produce a well coordinated inter-segmental motion not only for the preferred leg but also for the non-preferred leg. The faster leg swing observed for the preferred leg was most likely a result of the larger muscle moment. KEY WORDS: segmental interaction, resultant joint moment. kicking. INTRODUCTION: In the course of an actual soccer match, players are forced to kick the ball using not only their preferred foot but also their non-preferred foot. Thus, many players, coaches and scientists share a belief that mixed footedness is an advantage given the natur...|$|R

Thus, the ball remains in a generally upright position when the motorcycle leans left or right into a turn because the base of the pivot ball hitch is able to move in the opposite direction of the motorcycle without causing the coupler to bind.|$|R

40|$|Kicking {{with the}} non-preferred leg is {{important}} in Australian Football and becoming important in the rugby codes. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine differences between preferred and non-preferred leg kicking in the drop punt kick. Seventeen elite Australian Football players performed kicks with the preferred and non-preferred leg. Optotrak Certus collected kinematic data of the kick leg and pelvis (200 Hz) from kick leg toe-off until ball contact. Foot speed, knee <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> angular velocity at <b>ball</b> contact, <b>and</b> pelvis range of motion were significantly larger for the preferred leg (P < 0. 05). In contrast, hip and thigh angular velocity at <b>ball</b> contact <b>and</b> hip range of motion were significantly larger for the non-preferred leg. This indicates different movement patterns, with preferred-leg kicks making greater use of the pelvis, knee, <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> while non-preferred leg kicks rely relatively more on the hip and thigh (P < 0. 05). Reasons for this difference might be due to locking degrees of freedom or sub-optimal sequencing in the non-preferred leg. The thighâ€“knee continuum identified by Ball (2008) was also evident in this study. Findings have implications for training non-preferred leg kicking for performance and injury prevention. ...|$|R

40|$|Data on {{body weight}} <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> length {{measurement}} of 361 birds from 5 hatches, one week apart were analysed to obtain heritability estimates for body weight <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> length at 20, 30 and 40 weeks of age, {{as well as}} to establish the genetic and phenotypic correlations between the traits. The mean values for body weight at various ages showed good performance of all birds. The heritability estimates observed for body weight <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> length decreases with increasing age of birds. This observation agreed with the reports of some workers and disagreed with the findings of others. Differences however, in heritability estimates could be attributed to differences in method of estimation, breed, environmental effects and sampling error due to small data or sample size. There were positively high genetic and phenotypic correlations between body weight <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> length at these ages. The coefficient of genetic correlation (r g) ranged between 0. 582 and 0. 645, while the coefficient of phenotypic correlation (r p) ranged between 0. 613 and 0. 816.

This study aimed to compare rearfoot <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> kinematics between barefoot, running shoes and gait sandal conditions during running. We hypothesised that gait sandals would more closely replicate the kinematics seen when wearing running shoes than when barefoot. Rearfoot <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> kinematics were measured in 14 male participants as they ran in three footwear conditions (barefoot, gait sandals and running shoes) at 3. 5 m/s. Both barefoot and gait sandals resulted in greater peak rearfoot eversion compared to running shoes. Gait sandals were similar to running shoes for all other variables.

40|$|NoBackground - Although {{there is}} a wealth of {{research}} into the kinematic coupling between the foot <b>and</b> <b>shank,</b> it remains unclear whether the relationship is stable across speed and mode of gait. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether the coupling relationship between the forefoot, rearfoot <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> differed between walking and running, and across different running speeds. Methods Twelve subjects walked/ran barefoot over-ground at one walking and three running speeds. The <b>shank,</b> rearfoot <b>and</b> forefoot were modelled as rigid segments and three-dimensional joint kinematics were determined using a seven camera ProReflex system. Coupling between the forefoot, rearfoot <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> was assessed using cross-correlation and vector coding techniques. Findings Cross-correlation of rearfoot eversion/inversion with shank internal/external rotation was lower in walking (r= 0. 49) compared to running (r> 0. 95). This was also the case between rearfoot frontal plane and forefoot sagittal plane motion (walking, r=Â¿ 0. 80; running, r=Â¿ 0. 96). Rearfoot frontal plane and forefoot transverse plane cross-correlation was high in both running and walking (r> 0. 90), but there was little evidence of any coupling between rearfoot frontal plane and forefoot frontal plane motion in any condition. No differences in cross-correlations were found between the three running speeds. Interpretation Kinematic coupling between the forefoot, rearfoot <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> was weak during walking relative to running. In particular, the low cross-correlation between rearfoot eversion/inversion <b>and</b> <b>shank</b> internal/external rotation during walking implies the two motions are not rigidly linked, as has been assumed in previous injury models...|$|R
