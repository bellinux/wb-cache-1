40|$|The {{problem of}} {{regulating}} the distillate impurity content in a two-feed (paraffin-olefin) industrial multicomponent distillation column (iso-normal <b>butane</b> <b>splitter)</b> by manipulating the heat duty according to olefin-to-total feedflow load disturbance and tray temperature measurements is addressed. First, the detailed model-based nonlinear state-feedback robust control problem is addressed, identifying the solvability conditions and attainable closed-loop behavior. Then, {{the behavior of}} this controller is recovered with an output feedback PI temperature controller with dynamic feedforward setpoint compensation and antiwindup protection. The proposed approach is illustrated and tested through numerical simulations with a detailed model calibrated with industrial data, establishing the feasibility of improving the existing control scheme with PI temperature control plus manual setpoint compensation...|$|E
