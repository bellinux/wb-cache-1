Hence, the slenderness effect of the single curvature mode is higher (H*/b =  30.28), which resulted in a significant decrease in the ultimate capacity as confirmed by the experimental result of such column (S- 3 - 5) where its ultimate capacity was about 33  % of the axial capacity of C- 0 - 0. On the other hand, column bent in <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> mode has slenderness ratio of 17.02, which resulted in moderate effect on the ultimate capacity.

40|$|Abstract. The severe <b>double</b> <b>curvatures</b> often {{encountered}} in aerospace fuselage and nacelle skins often necessitate multistage stretch forming operations. Each stage adds {{value to the}} component and rejection, particularly at later stages, must be avoided. Therefore process optimisation using accurate modelling tools to predict the strain levels is essential. This paper presents a novel method for modelling the aforementioned stages of the process using a tailored material model based on strain history and heat treatment. The modelling process is implemented within the PAMSTAMP Finite Element code, by modifying the material properties in the input file using an Excel based algorithm. The proposed method is validated using profiled stretch formed specimens, thereby imposing a variable strain gradient in a single specimen without having to resort to the complexity <b>of</b> <b>double</b> <b>curvature.</b> The model results are shown to represent the observed behaviour well...|$|R

40|$|The use of grid shell {{structures}} in architecture and structural engineering has risen {{in the past}} decade, yet fundamental research on the mechanics of such structures is lacking. Grid shells are long span structures comprised of a lattice of single layer members forming a curved surface. Grid shells can be made {{of a wide range}} of materials from steel to wood. They have potential to be used in readapting existing spaces or in new aesthetically pleasing structures. By studying their mechanics, engineers can be more effective at the schematic phase of design so that the potential of grid shells can be maximized. This research conducts a parametric study that varies the topology and topography of grid shells. The parametric space is framed around real-world design constraints including the grid spacing, panel shape, span-to-height ratio and the use <b>of</b> <b>double</b> <b>curvature.</b> In this thesis, the buckling capacity is evaluated using finite element analysis for two typical grid shell geometries: the spherical cap and the corrugated vault. First, a spherical cap is considered for which an analytical solution exists and therefore the accuracy of the numerical procedure is validated. Simple closed-form solutions are derived using the concept of the equivalent continuum and compared to the numerical models. Then, the parametric study of the spherical cap is performed including variations of the grid spacing, the span to height ratio and the panel shape (triangles and quadrilaterals). Having determined the efficiency of the computational tool the study is extended to the barrel vault. Here the new features of the analysis are the use <b>of</b> <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> by introducing corrugation along the edge and the crown. By understanding the fundamental mechanical behavior of grid shells, design guidelines aimed to maximize their capacity and efficiency and intended to facilitate the discussion between architect and engineer are proposed. by Samar Rula Malek.

An algorithm is developed for placing prismatic planks on to a three-dimensional hull form to represent a planked construction. A number of well-known hull forms are examined using the algorithm developed in order to assess their suitability for this construction technique. It is shown that typical round-bilged forms are unsuitable for planked construction, since an undesirably large proportion of the material strength will be used in forming the structure. A conceptual design for a simplified hull form is developed which contains significantly reduced levels <b>of</b> <b>double</b> <b>curvature,</b> and this design is shown to be suitable for planked construction, as well as offering the potential for advantages in conventional plated construction.

50|$|In {{the later}} {{examples}} of the Decorated Period the omission of the circles in the tracery of windows had led to the employment <b>of</b> curves <b>of</b> <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> which developed into flamboyant tracery: {{the introduction of the}} perpendicular lines was a reaction in the contrary direction. The style grew out of the shadow of the Black Death which killed about a third of England's population in 18 months between June 1348 and December 1349 and returned in 1361-62 to kill another fifth. This had a great effect on the arts and culture, which took a decidedly morbid and pessimistic direction. It can be argued that Perpendicular architecture reveals a populace affected by overwhelming shock and grief, focusing on death and despair, and no longer able to justify previous flamboyance or jubilation present in the Decorated style. The style was affected by the labour shortages caused by the plague as architects designed less elaborately to cope.|$|R

It is shown that the water entry problem with arbitrary kinematics of the body motion, can be reduced to the vertical entry problem with a modified vertical displacement of the body and an elliptic region of contact between the liquid and the body surface. Low pressure occurrence is determined; this occurrence can precede the appearance of cavitation effects. Hydrodynamic forces are analysed for a rigid ellipsoid entering the water with 3 d. f. Experimental results with an oblique impact of elliptic paraboloid confirm the theoretical findings.

So {{there is no}} doubt about the advantages offered, mainly from the economic point of view, by the processes that use flat or developable surfaces in the resolution of doubly curved ones. Using two prototypical kinds of developable surfaces, an adaptation method <b>of</b> <b>double</b> <b>curvature</b> surfaces is formulated using either developable strips or planar quadrilateral surfaces. Through the geometric concept of apparent contours and by the systematization of a process inspired by traditional projective geometry an algorithm is built, using the newest and outstanding CAD processes.
