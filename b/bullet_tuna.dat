40|$|The Fishing Industry in the Philippines {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the food and employment need of Filipino fishers. By using anchored Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs or payao), the Philippine tuna fisheries was transformed into a million-dollar industry. Minimal studies on exploitation rates and fish behavior around anchored FADs hampered further understanding of this fishery practice. Studies on fish behavior using Local Ecological Knowledge (LEK) are good complement where data is limited. A study using semi-structured interview (n = 46) and three focus group discussions (n = 39 participants) to record fishers' knowledge and observations on the behavior of different fish species around anchored FADs was conducted. This particularly focused on attraction, retention, and departure behavior of fishes in identified FAD sites. Based on the fishers' knowledge, tuna schools are attracted to anchored FADs at 10 km distance. In anchored FADs, tuna form schools segregated by species and size. There was no relationship between the attraction distance and the reported school size and the various waiting times for fish to aggregate below the FADs. There was no variation between the species present at day or night time although fishers have reported a distinction of species found near the surface (0 - 10 m) and those found at other depths (11 - 20 m). Juvenile yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares), skipjack (Katsuwonus pelamis), and frigate and <b>bullet</b> <b>tunas</b> (Auxis spp.) are found to stay at 25 - 50 m from the FAD at a depth of > 20 m. Adult oceanic tunas reside in deeper waters (75 m).

Studies of stomach contents have found that smaller schooling scombrids such as frigate mackerel, <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna,</b> and skipjack tuna make up a substantial proportion of their diet. Squid and deep-sea fishes such as pomfret and snake mackerel are also important prey items in certain areas. Blue marlin have been recorded to take prey as large as white marlin, as well as yellowfin and bigeye tuna in the 100-lb range. Conversely, they are also capable of feeding on small but numerous prey such as filefish and snipefish.|$|E

40|$|The {{trophic ecology}} of bluefin tuna larvae (Thunnus thynnus) from the Balearic Sea, {{together}} with its co-existing tuna {{species such as}} albacore (T. alalunga), bullet (Auxis rochei) and little tunny (Euthynnus alletteratus) were examined by nitrogen and carbon stable isotope analyses. A total of 286 larvae were analyzed for this study, of which 72 larvae corresponded to bluefin, 57 to albacore, 81 to <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna</b> and 76 to little tunny. Tuna larvae were separated into the pre-flexion and post-flexion developmental stages. Within the size 3 – 9 mm standard length (SL), the stable isotope of nitrogen (δ 15 N) showed significant differences between species where bluefin tuna larvae ranked highest. Pre-flexion bluefin tuna and little tunny larvae showed significantly higher δ 15 N signatures than the post-flexion larvae. This effect is attributed to a biochemical trace of maternal δ 15 N signatures. However, neither albacore nor <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae showed this pattern in δ 15 N signatures, possibly owing to a compensation effect between lower maternal δ 15 N values transmitted to pre-flexion larvae and the early increase of δ 15 N values in post-flexion stages. One way ANOVA showed significant differences between species in the stable isotope ratio of carbon (δ 13 C) values, which suggests specific differences of carbon sources. Furthermore, a similar significant ontogenic effect between δ 13 C signatures of pre-flexion and post-flexion larvae is also evidenced in all four species. At pre-flexion stages, all species except <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae showed significant negative relationships between δ 15 N and larval standard length. At post-flexion stages, a significant linear relationship with larval size was only observed in albacore and <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna</b> larvae indicating a possible trophic shift towards early piscivory. With respect to δ 13 C values with larval size, all four species showed significant linear decreases. It {{may be explained by}} the metabolism of growth of somatic mass subject to modification of the relative carbon isotopic sources. In conclusion, the species' signatures of δ 15 N and δ 13 C indicate differentiated early life trophic niches.

María Pilar Olivar Buera del Institut de Ciències del Mar (ICM-CSIC) y del Dr. Fernando Villate Guinea de la Universidad del Pais Vasco (UPV). [...] 141 pagesWe have analysed {{the relationship}} of the ictioplankton community with its fisical and trophic environment in two hydrographical contrasting conditions (summer stratification versus autumn mixed column), and we have characterized the larval diet of five teleost species in the NW Mediterranean: the three clupeiform of the region [anchovy (Engraulis encrasicolus), sardine (Sardina pilchardus) and round sardinella (Sardinella aurita) ], a small tuna [bullet tuna (Auxis rochei) ] and the most important demersal species of the region [hake (Merluccius merluccius) ]. These species have been chosen because they represent two different morphotypes, 1) that of the clupeiforms, which correspond to a stylized larvae with small mouth, long body and digestive tract linked to the tail, and 2) that of <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna</b> and hake, which correspond to a robust larvae with big mouth, robust body and compact digestive tract independent of the tail. Moreover, we have studied the diet variations i) along development, in relation to ii) prey availability and iii) morphology of the feeding-related structures like visual system, mouth and digestive tract. Feeding is an important aspect of the larval fish ecology that affects the population dynamics (through larval survival and subsequence recruitment fluctuations). The factors that affect the larvae in their prey selection and the feeding strategies have been scarcely studied for these species in the Catalan Sea. These factors can be different depending on the species and can change with ontogeny. The main objective of this Ph. D has been to understand the specific trophic strategies of the larvae of these five important species in Mediterranean fisheries. We can point out three types of strategies: 1) The hake’s one, which from the onset specializes feeding in a prey type (Clausocalanus spp.) and only increases the number of copepods to respond to the nutritional requirements of growth. 2) Anchovy and sardine’s type, which show low feeding incidence at the beginning, and they change the size and number of preys step by step along development without showing abrupt changes in the diet. 3) <b>Bullet</b> <b>tuna</b> and hake’s type, opportunist species which deeply adjust their prey type (and size) in their larval period as they enhance their abilities [ [...] . ]Esta Tesis Doctoral ha sido realizada gracias a una beca/contrato predoctoral del Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovación (España) durante 4 años que se encuadra dentro del Programa de Formación de Personal Investigador (FPI) y ha comprendido un periodo de tiempo desde el 1 de Agosto de 2005 hasta el 30 de julio de 2009 Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Early life {{stages of}} tuna species were {{investigated}} along the Tunisian east coast {{during the summer}} of 2008 by means of a larval survey conducted on board the R/V HANNIBAL. In this study we define the spawning grounds of tuna fishes in Tunisian waters and relate the tuna larvae spatial distribution to the hydrographic features and other environmental parameters. A total of 282 larvae of Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus, Linnaeus, 1758), 902 of <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna</b> (Auxis rochei, Risso, 1810) and 19 of little tuna (Euthynnus alletteratus, Raf, 1810), were identified. High larval concentrations of bluefin tuna were located offshore (mean = 200 ± 18 m), at sea surface temperatures ranging between 23. 7 to 25. 3 °C, whereas the highest concentrations of bullet and little tuna were located in shallower waters (mean = 135 ± 75 m), at sea surface temperature ranging between 25. 1 to 25. 9 °C. According to their preference for waters with surface salinities ranging between 37. 1 and 37. 8, spawning of these species seems to occur mainly in mixed waters. Stations where tuna larvae were collected showed oxygen concentrations between 6. 55 and 6. 85 mg l- 1, as well as low turbidity and chlorophyll a values, from 0. 2 to 0. 5 NTU a d less than 1 mg m- 3, respectively. These three environmental factors were weakly correlated with tuna larvae abundancePublicado...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} {{investigations}} on the swordfish fishery in the Turkish Aegean Sea are presented. A total of 65 boats (6 - 14 m {{in length and}} 11. 5 - 135 hp in engine power) participated in this fishery from two main fishing ports, Sivrice and Fethiye, and the Datça-Bozburun Peninsula. This fishery is also carried out off Antalya Bay. The total annual swordfish catch was 425 t in 2005. The fishing period for swordfish normally takes place during eight months. However, the main activity is concentrated {{in the spring and}} summer seasons on moonless nights, because of the closed season (between October 1 and January 31) and adverse meteorological conditions. Although, there are various fishing gears and techniques for swordfish, the two main fishing gears used in the Aegean Sea are longline and driftnet. About ten non-target species, bluefin tuna, Atlantic black skipjack, albacore, Mediterranean spearfish, <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna,</b> dolphinfish, manta ray, sunfish, sharks and dolphins were determined from both longlining and drift-netting.

40|$|A {{total of}} 216 dorsal fin spines from western Mediterranean <b>bullet</b> <b>tuna</b> were {{analyzed}} from 2003 to 2006 for ageing and growth studies. The {{length of the}} aged individuals ranged from 31 to 44 cm for the males and from 31 to 46 cm for the females. Fish ages ranged 2 to 5 years old and the mean lengths by age were calculated for males and females. Growth parameter estimates were calculated from 206 cut spine sections which provided readable growth annuli by sex. The standard von Bertalanffy growth function was used to fit length at- age data. The growth parameters based on standard von Bertalanffy growth function are the following: for males, L ∞ (asymptotic length) = 43. 751 cm, k (growth coefficient) = 0. 865, t 0 (age at zero length) =- 0568; for females, L∞= 45. 545 cm, k= 0. 461, t 0 =- 0. 821; for both sexes, L∞= 44. 041 cm, k= 0. 700, t 0 =- 0. 139. The relationships between FL and dorsal fin spine diameter were calculated for both sexes. Age-length keys were provided for catch at age calculation application.
