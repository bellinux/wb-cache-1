40|$|The current world-wide {{economic}} recession {{has meant that}} the decision-making process for purchasing new instrumentation has gained more importance and priority for laboratory managers. The process requires careful consideration of cost and, even more important, comparable data on the reliability and dependability of a particular instrument. At the present time it is often very difficult to obtain objective, comparable data. When a new item of equipment comes on the market a prospective purchaser often has little information about its performance, other than that from the manufacturer, or perhaps a colleague who might have done a trial for the manufacturer. Neither of these sources could be considered independent and {{it is unlikely that}} any testing will have followed a carefully designed and internationally accepted protocol. Therefore, many laboratories perform extensive evaluation studies before a purchase decision is made. Standardization of evaluation studies would improve the comparability of the results reported Several national and international organizations are involved in standardizing the procedure for instrument testing, especially for evaluations of analytical analysers. Some examples are listed in table 1. These Table 1. Evaluation protocols proposed by various organizations.
