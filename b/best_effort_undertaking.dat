In this paper we analyze the coexistence of the QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows from the routing and scheduling point of view. We concentrate in our routing and scheduling analysis on the network bandwidth resource. We present two sets of source routing algorithms: (1) the bandwidth-constrained routing with imprecise state information for QoS flows, and (2) the maxmin fair routing for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows. The routing analysis includes an extensive description of various algorithms in their domains and their complexity discussion. Furthermore, we discuss two level hierarchical scheduling which is tailored towards the needs raised by the coexistence of QoS and <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows. We show that this scheduling design accomplishes two design goals (1) guaranteeing QoS for QoS flows and (2) ensuring fairness for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> flows [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the problem of <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic {{delivery}} in 802. 11 e contention-based networks. Differently from most previous paper which focus on the support of quality of service (QoS) requirements, we study the tuning of the access parameters for the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we discuss the coexistence between legacy DCF and EDCA stations, since, for guaranteeing the backward compatibility, the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service class defined in EDCA should correspond to the legacy DCF. We show what configurations of the access parameters are closer to the DCF protocol, by taking into account the slightly different backoff rules defined in EDCA. Second, we explore the optimizations that can be performed by dynamically tuning the access parameters, on a per-beacon basis, in the case of homogeneous <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> sources. We propose an effective algorithm able to maximize the system throughput, by adapting the minimum contention window to the network contention level. Finally, we analyze the amount of resources available for <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> traffic in presence of QoS traffic. We show that the dynamic adaptation of the minimum contention window {{as a function of the}} channel wasted times can be a valid solution to automatically regulate the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> offered load in the network...|$|R

We also evaluate {{the performance of}} IEEE 802. 16 networks by conducting various experiments in the current deployed IEEE 802. 16 networks of a leading telecom operator in India.

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{explanation}} for the underpricing of <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> new issues and demonstrates that <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> contracts allow issuers to use information from the market. If investors obtain information that indicates that a project will not be profitable, their demand will be low and the offering will be withdrawn. If this information is costly, investors will have to be compensated for its purchase through a lower offering price, which means that issuers will have to underprice. The result is consistent with the empirical observation that underpricing is considerably greater for <b>best</b> <b>efforts</b> than for firm commitment contracts.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{availability}} of sophisticated network quality of service (QoS) guaranteeing mechanisms, it is apparent {{that a large number of}} applications will continue using the <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service class. The main reason for this is that the QoS guaranteeing mechanisms are complex and many applications are not capable of using these complex services. At the same time, the standard <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> service is rather unpredictable and hence insufficient for many applications. Thus augmenting <b>best</b> <b>effort</b> services to an appropriate standard without incurring a high level of complexity is necessary. In this paper, two such augmentations are described in the context of the UBR service of ATM networks. Selective packet discarding is used to achieve the necessary goals...|$|R
