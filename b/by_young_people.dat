5|$|Common ways to {{implement}} the Scout method include having Scouts spending time together in small groups with shared experiences, rituals, and activities, and emphasizing 'good citizenship' and decision-making <b>by</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> in an age-appropriate manner. Weekly meetings often take place in local centres known as Scout dens. Cultivating a love and appreciation of the outdoors and outdoor activities is a key element. Primary activities include camping, woodcraft, aquatics, hiking, backpacking, and sports.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used <b>by</b> <b>young</b> <b>people,</b> long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of teenage pregnancy. After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

5|$|Rinkeby Swedish (after Rinkeby, {{a suburb}} of {{northern}} Stockholm with a large immigrant population) is a common name among linguists for varieties of Swedish spoken <b>by</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> of foreign heritage in certain suburbs and urban districts in the major cities of Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmö. These varieties could alternatively be classified as sociolects, because the immigrant dialects share common traits independent of their geographical spread or the native country of the speakers. However, some studies have found distinctive features and led to terms such as Rosengård Swedish (after Rosengård in Malmö), a variant of Scanian. A survey made by the Swedish linguist Ulla-Britt Kotsinas showed that foreign learners had difficulties in guessing the origins of Rinkeby Swedish speakers in Stockholm. The greatest difficulty proved to be identifying the speech of a boy speaking Rinkeby Swedish whose parents were both Swedish; only 1.8% guessed his native language correctly.|$|E
5|$|The arts {{scene in}} Antananarivo {{is the largest}} and most vibrant in the country. Madagascar's diverse music is {{reflected}} in the many concerts, cabarets, dance clubs and other musical venues throughout Antananarivo. In the dry season, outdoor concerts are regularly held in venues including the Antsahamanitra amphitheater and Mahamasina Stadium. Concerts and night clubs are attended mainly <b>by</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> of the middle to upper classes who can afford the entrance fees. More affordable are performances of traditional vakindrazana or Malagasy operettas at Isotry Theater and hira gasy at the city's outdoor cheminots theater or Alliance française; these performances are more popular with older and rural audiences than among urban youth. Nightlife is the most animated in the ville moyenne neighborhoods of Antaninarenina, Tsaralalana, Behoririka, Mahamasina and Andohalo.|$|E

25|$|Evidence {{shows that}} a {{combination}} of comprehensive sex education and access to birth control appears to decrease the rates of unintended pregnancies among teenagers. A meta-analysis that compared comprehensive sex education programs with abstinence-only programs found that abstinence-only programs did not reduce the likelihood of pregnancy, but rather may have increased it. Numerous studies show that curricula providing accurate information about condoms and contraception can lead to reductions in the risky behaviors reported <b>by</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> as well as reductions in unintended pregnancies and STIs. Programs that teach only abstinence have not been shown to be effective.|$|E

25|$|The large inner-city area of South Los Angeles {{offers an}} example of change caused by ethnic succession, where new {{immigrants}} replace former residents who move away or where an older generation is replaced <b>by</b> <b>young</b> <b>people</b> with children. This also often occurs because African Americans have emulated the white flight of their European American counterparts {{and move to the}} outer sections of the Greater Los Angeles areas to escape the ever-increasing Hispanic population. In 1985 African Americans made up 72% {{of the population of the}} area. By 2006 the black proportion of the population had decreased to just 24%. The Latino population had risen from 21% in 1985 to 69% in 2006, as one population replaced another. From 2004-2005, Latino demand for housing caused prices to rise more than 40 percent in Watts and South Central Los Angeles.|$|E

30|$|An {{increase}} of one unit in {{age of the}} household head increased {{the likelihood of a}} household being pastoral by 2  % (p[*]=[*] 0.008) as opposed to being off-farm. Off-farm activities were more pursed <b>by</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people</b> than older people. However, age was not a significant associated factor in uptake of off-farm activities as opposed to agro-pastoral livelihoods. Pursuance of pastoral livelihoods required that an individual accumulates a sizeable number of livestock {{and at the same time}} create good networks to ensure survival of the herd. Both pastoralism and agro-pastoralism required possession and access to assets, especially livestock and land. Limited access to these assets was a barrier to entrance to pastoral and agro-pastoral livelihoods <b>by</b> <b>younger</b> <b>people.</b> This implied that older people were more likely to take up livestock-based or crop-based opportunities whereas the <b>young</b> <b>people</b> were more likely to take up off-farm opportunities. Barrett et al. (2001) also observe that <b>young</b> <b>people</b> are more likely to diversify into off-farm livelihood activities compared to the elderly.|$|R
