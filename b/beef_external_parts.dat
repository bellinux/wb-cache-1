More sweat wets the <b>external</b> <b>part</b> of the vellus strand and then evaporates. This process is called perspiration.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} {{bacterial}} flora of meat in chicken Shawarma (meat) were investigated from five {{different regions of}} Lahore.

But <b>external</b> <b>part</b> {{was found to be}} little more contaminated as compared to internal part. Analysis of microbes includes E. coli, Salmonella, Aerobes and Coliforms. Microbs were found in order of Aerobes > E. coli > Salmonella there is not too much variation of contamination in different regions but there is variation among the number of bacteria. In every part Aerobes were in greater number as compared to E. coli and Salmonella. Shawarma analyzed from the Site III was more contaminated as compared to other sites.

40|$|Chemical {{composition}} {{in different parts}} of banana pulp was determined. Ash and protein mean concentrations in {{the central part of the}} pulp were higher than in the medium part, and these were higher than those in the <b>external</b> <b>part.</b> The mean concentrations of the fiber (total and non-soluble) in the central part were higher than those found in the other parts. Ascorbic acid behaved inversely; the mean concentration significantly decreased from the <b>external</b> <b>part</b> to the central part. The central part contained the highest mean concentrations of the analysed minerals (Na, K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn), with statistically significant differences for Cu, Zn and Ca. A tendency to differentiate the pulp samples of banana as a function of the part considered was observed after using factor analysis. The samples from the central part were different from those from the <b>external</b> <b>part.</b> The samples of the medium part overlapped with those of the other two parts...|$|R

50|$|The Variscan Orogeny {{occurred}} as the European Hunic Terrane (split off from Gondwana) and Laurentia-Baltica continents collided. In Iberia this occurred in pre-Stephanian Carboniferous (354-305 Ma). The <b>external</b> <b>part</b> of the orogeny was the Cantabrian Zone. This was deformed {{in the upper}} crustal layers. The West Asturian Leonese Zone and Central Iberian Zone are the <b>external</b> <b>parts</b> of the orogeny and are more deeply deformed and metamorphosed, and intruded. These three zones are part of one terrane. The Ossa-Morena Zone and South Portuguese Zone are two different terranes that have become attached. In the Mesozoic this was mostly covered with other sediments, which have since eroded.|$|R
