5|$|All {{members of}} the Temple must be {{affiliated}} with a pylon, and thus membership is by application, requiring contact with a Setian priestess or priest followed by an evaluation period. The participation of non-initiated in the Temple's rituals are forbidden, due {{to the belief that}} their rituals would <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> in the wrong hands.|$|E
5|$|As a {{cryogenic}} liquid, {{liquid nitrogen}} can <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> by causing cold burns on contact, although the Leidenfrost effect provides protection for very short exposure (about one second). Ingestion of liquid nitrogen can cause severe internal damage. For example, in 2012, {{a young woman}} in England had to have her stomach removed after ingesting a cocktail made with liquid nitrogen.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen azide (HN3) {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1890 by the oxidation of aqueous hydrazine by nitrous acid. It is very explosive and even dilute solutions can <b>be</b> <b>dangerous.</b> It has a disagreeable and irritating smell {{and is a}} potentially lethal (but not cumulative) poison. It may be considered the conjugate acid of the azide anion, and is similarly analogous to the hydrohalic acids.|$|E

5|$|Like other arthropods, spiders have to molt to grow {{as their}} cuticle ("skin") cannot stretch. In some species males mate with newly molted females, which are too weak to <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to the males. Most spiders live for only one to two years, {{although}} some tarantulas can live in captivity for over 20 years.|$|E
5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well if inhaled or ingested.|$|E

The less frequent effects are irritability, sweating, depersonalization, derealization, hypersensitivity to stimuli, depression, suicidal behavior, psychosis, seizures, and delirium tremens. Severe symptoms usually {{occur as a}} result of abrupt or over-rapid withdrawal. Abrupt withdrawal can <b>be</b> <b>dangerous,</b> therefore a gradual reduction regimen is recommended.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor in}} Wallace's {{thinking}} was his belief that, {{because of the}} action of natural selection, organisms were {{in a state of}} balance with their environment, and that everything in nature, even disease-causing organisms, served a useful purpose in the natural order of things; he feared vaccination might upset that natural balance with unfortunate results. Wallace and other anti-vaccinationists pointed out that vaccination, which at the time was often done in a sloppy and unsanitary manner, could <b>be</b> <b>dangerous.</b>|$|E
5|$|Areas of {{the coast}} near Exmouth, The Fleet at Weymouth and the beaches at Studland have also been used for {{training}} for war, but have since been returned to civilian use. Parts {{of the coast}}, especially around Portland, can <b>be</b> <b>dangerous,</b> and shipwrecks have been {{a feature of the}} coast. In January 2007 the coast experienced its most environmentally damaging wreck when the MSC Napoli, a 2,400 capacity container ship, was beached at Branscombe near Sidmouth, losing oil and cargo.|$|E

5|$|Concerns {{had been}} raised that the {{radiation}} belt produced in orbit by the recent Operation Dominic nuclear tests would <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> to manned space missions, but an extensive study announced in early September declared that {{it was safe to}} fly. While the outside of the capsule was expected to receive a dosage of around 500 röntgens, the study concluded that shielding and the effect of the spacecraft structure would reduce this to around 8 röntgens experienced by the astronaut, well within established tolerance limits.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are fairly}} {{abundant}} and {{are found in}} many areas around the world. There {{is no evidence that}} they transmit diseases to humans or other animals.

It is a common myth that earwigs crawl into the human ear and lay eggs in the brain.|$|E
5|$|Inhaling helium can <b>be</b> <b>dangerous</b> if done to excess, since helium is {{a simple}} {{asphyxiant}} and so displaces oxygen needed for normal respiration. Fatalities have been recorded, including a youth who suffocated in Vancouver in 2003 and two adults who suffocated in South Florida in 2006. In 1998, an Australian girl (her age is not known) from Victoria fell unconscious and temporarily turned blue after inhaling the entire contents of a party balloon.|$|E

5|$|Pharmacologically active plant {{extracts}} {{can interact}} with conventional drugs, both {{because they may}} provide an increased dose of similar compounds, and because some phytochemicals interfere with the body's systems that metabolise drugs in the liver including the cytochrome P450 system, making the drugs last longer {{in the body and}} have a more powerful cumulative effect.
