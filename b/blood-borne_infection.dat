5|$|The {{most common}} cause of {{infection}} is Escherichia coli, though other bacteria or fungi may rarely be the cause. Risk factors include female anatomy, sexual intercourse, diabetes, obesity, and family history. Although sexual intercourse is a risk factor, UTIs are not classified as sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Kidney infection, if it occurs, usually follows a bladder infection but may also result from a <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infection.</b> Diagnosis in young healthy women can be based on symptoms alone. In those with vague symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult because bacteria may be present without there being an infection. In complicated cases or if treatment fails, a urine culture may be useful.|$|E
25|$|Infection of the incisions or of {{the inside}} of the abdomen (peritonitis, abscess) may occur due to release of {{bacteria}} from the bowel during the operation. Nosocomial infections, such as pneumonia, bladder or kidney infections, and sepsis (<b>blood-borne</b> <b>infection)</b> are also possible. Effective short-term use of antibiotics, diligent respiratory therapy, and encouragement of activity within a few hours after surgery can reduce the risks of infections.|$|E
25|$|Infants {{can acquire}} lung infections before birth by {{breathing}} infected amniotic fluid {{or through a}} <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infection</b> which crossed the placenta. Infants can also inhale contaminated fluid from the vagina at birth. The most prevalent pathogen causing CAP in newborns is Streptococcus agalactiae, also known as group-B streptococcus (GBS). GBS causes {{more than half of}} CAP in the first week after birth. Other bacterial causes of neonatal CAP include Listeria monocytogenes and a variety of mycobacteria. CAP-causing viruses may also be transferred from mother to child; herpes simplex virus (the most common) is life-threatening, and adenoviridae, mumps and enterovirus can also cause pneumonia. Another cause of CAP in this group is Chlamydia trachomatis, acquired at birth but not causing pneumonia until two to four weeks later; it usually presents with no fever and a characteristic, staccato cough.|$|E

40|$|Background: The Ministry of Health, Treatment and Medical Education of Iran has {{recently}} announced an estimated figure of 200, 000 injecting drug users (IDUs). The {{aim of this}} study was to pilot a national program using demographics, types of drug abuse and prevalence of <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infections</b> among IDUs. Methods: In order to elicit data on demographics, types of drug abuse and prevalence of <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infections</b> among IDUs, a questionnaire was designed in the Bureau of Mental-Social Health and Addiction in collaboration with Iranâ€™s Drug Control Headquarters of the Police Department. Therapeutical alliance of addiction in Shafagh Center was based on Methadone Maintenance Therapy (MMT). Results: Among 402 reported IDUs most of them were male, single and in age range of 20 to 39 years old with 72. 7 % history of imprisonment. Most of them had elementary and high school education and a history of addiction treatment. The majority were current users of opioid, heroin and crack. The prevalence of <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infections</b> was 65. 9 % and 18. 8 % for HCV and HIV/AIDS infections, respectively. Conclusion: Prevention programs about harm reduction, treatment and counseling should include young IDUs as a core focus of their intervention structur...|$|R

50|$|Hepatitis B {{carries the}} {{greatest}} risk of transmission, with 37-62% of exposed workers eventually showing seroconversion and 22-31% having symptoms. Higher rates of hepatitis B vaccination among {{the general public and}} healthcare workers have reduced the risk of transmission; non-healthcare workers still have a lower HBV vaccine rate and therefore a higher risk. The hepatitis C transmission rate has been reported at 1.8%, but newer, larger surveys have shown only a 0.5% transmission rate. The overall risk of HIV infection after percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected material in the health care setting is 0.3%. Individualized risk of <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infection</b> from a used biomedical sharp is further dependent upon additional factors. Injuries with a hollow-bore needle, deep penetration, visible blood on the needle, a needle located in a deep artery or vein, or a biomedical device contaminated with blood from a terminally ill patient increase the risk for contracting a <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infection.</b>|$|E

50|$|Babies born in low {{to middle}} income {{countries}} in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia are at the highest risk of neonatal death. Bacterial infections of the bloodstream, lungs, and the brain's covering (meningitis) are responsible for 25% of neonatal deaths. Newborns can acquire infections during birth from bacteria that are present in their mother's reproductive tract. The mother {{may not be aware}} of the infection, or she may have an untreated pelvic inflammatory disease or sexually transmitted disease. These bacteria can move up the vaginal canal into the amniotic sac surrounding the baby. Maternal <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infection</b> is another route of bacterial infection from mother to baby. Neonatal infection is also more likely with the premature rupture of the membranes (PROM) of the amniotic sac.|$|E

50|$|Treatment {{following}} the prison release {{can be difficult}} because individuals must locate facilities that can provide them treatment while considering their social status, limited knowledge, and access to these resources. Hepatitis C {{has been one of}} the most widespread <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infection</b> to date within the United States of America. From 2005 to 2006, the state of New York began implementing the Hepatitis C Continuity Program, offering free HCV treatment for inmates even after release from its state prisons. The program encompassed 70 prisons and 21 health-care facilities. This program was put together by the collaborative efforts of New York State Department of Correctional Services, New York State Department of Health, New York State Division of Parole, New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation, and other community-based health care providers. Together, these organizations addressed the immediate need for medication upon release from prison. Inmates were given proper medication provided they possess Medicaid or any other kind of health insurance and eligibility. This program also included a facility referral system, making it easier for inmates to find the most convenient treatment location for them.|$|E

40|$|My bachelor's thesis {{focuses on}} {{identifying}} paramedics' awareness of <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infections.</b> The issue of infections transmitted by blood is very extensive and complicated. Much {{emphasis is placed}} on prevention by health care employees who are threatened by infections of this kind in their day-to-day practice. For the sake of structure, the thesis is divided into two main parts. The theoretical portion presents a comprehensive overview of blood-borne diseases paramedics are exposed to while performing their work. It also explains terms such as paramedic and the importance of first aid service. The practical portion contains the actual survey and the evaluation of results. This section of the thesis uses quantitative research method via questionnaires. Data was obtained through questioning using anonymous questionnaires. The surveyed group included 90 paramedics. The aim of the work was to identify paramedics' awareness of <b>blood-borne</b> <b>infections,</b> find out what kind of personal protective equipment, if any, they use, and whether applicable regulations are being complied with. Based on the results obtained from the survey, I have concluded that paramedics are not sufficiently aware of blood-borne diseases. I also found out that 33 % of the respondents violate applicable legislation by improper handling used by paramedics to the fullest possible extent. The most important aspects, I believe, are compliance with sanitary and epidemic regulations, vaccination, the availability of quality protective equipment and training as part of general prevention measures.
