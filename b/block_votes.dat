25|$|A general {{election}} for the Japanese House of Representatives {{was held on}} August 30, 2009. The opposition Democratic Party (DPJ) defeated the ruling coalition (Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and New Komeito Party) in a sweeping victory, winning 221 of the 300 electoral districts and receiving 42.4% of the proportional <b>block</b> <b>votes</b> for another 87 seats, a total of 308 seats to only 119 for the LDP (64 districts and 26.7% of the proportional votes).|$|E
25|$|The last general {{election}} {{took place in}} 2005 in which the LDP, led by popular prime minister Junichiro Koizumi, received 38.2% of the proportional <b>block</b> <b>votes</b> and 47.8% of the district votes cast (the next largest party, the DPJ, received 31% in the proportional and 36.4% in the district vote). Due to {{the characteristics of the}} Japanese election system, the LDP ended up with 296 seats in the Lower House (61.6%), which enabled Koizumi to complete the privatization of Japan Post. Since then Japan has had three further prime ministers (Shinzō Abe, Yasuo Fukuda and Tarō Asō) who have come to power without there being a {{general election}}.|$|E
50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>voting,</b> or {{plurality}} <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> {{is often}} compared with preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> as both systems tend to produce landslide victories for similar candidates. Instead {{of a series}} of checkboxes, preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> uses a preferential ballot. A slate of clones of the top preferred candidate will win every seat under both systems, however in preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> this is instead the instant-runoff winner.|$|R
50|$|<b>Block</b> <b>voting</b> {{was used}} in the Australian Senate from 1901 to 1948; from 1918, this was {{preferential}} <b>block</b> <b>voting.</b>|$|R
50|$|Preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> is a {{majoritarian}} {{voting system}} for electing several representatives {{from a single}} multimember constituency. Unlike the single transferable <b>vote,</b> preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> is not a method for obtaining proportional representation, and instead produces similar results to plurality <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> of which {{it can be seen}} as the instant-runoff version. Under both systems, a single group of like-minded voters can win every seat, making both forms of <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> nonproportional.|$|R

They appealed at the Labour Party {{national}} conference in October of that year. Two-thirds of constituency delegates voted against expulsions but the appeal of each member was lost when the [...] unions cast their <b>block</b> <b>votes</b> in a card vote, 5,160,000 to 1,616,000 in each case except for that of Grant who got 175,000 extra votes in his favour. Lynn Walsh, in his failed appeal asserted: [...] "Militant is not an organisation, it is not subsidiary or ancillary to any organisation outside the party ... Militant was proscribed {{as a result of}} an entirely one-sided inquiry which acted on McCarthyite reports and poison-pen letters from self-appointed snoopers." ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> {{system has}} a number of {{features}} which can make it unrepresentative of the voters' intentions. <b>Block</b> <b>voting</b> regularly produces complete landslide majorities for the group of candidates with the highest level of support. Under <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> a slate of clones of the top-place candidate may win every available seat. A voter does have the option to select candidates of different political stripes if they wish, though.|$|R
50|$|With {{or without}} a {{preferential}} element, <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> systems {{have a number of}} features which can make them unrepresentative of the diversity of voters' intentions. <b>Block</b> <b>voting</b> regularly produces complete landslide majorities for the group of candidates with the highest level of support. Under preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> a slate of clones of the first winning candidate are guaranteed to win every available seat. Although less representative, this does tend to lead to greater agreement among those elected.|$|R
5000|$|The {{system for}} electing {{senators}} has changed several times since Federation. The original arrangement involved a first-past-the-post <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> or [...] "winner takes all" [...] system, on a state-by-state basis. This was replaced in 1919 by preferential <b>block</b> <b>voting.</b> <b>Block</b> <b>voting</b> tended to produce landslide majorities and even [...] "wipe-outs".

50|$|For {{its first}} 100 years of existence, the United States House of Representatives {{did not pass}} {{legislation}} unless a full quorum of the House approved the bill.

The practice was terminated in February 1890, with {{the adoption of a}} new set of House rules. In particular, Rule XV (passed on February 14, 1890) established that a quorum is satisfied if a majority of members are present, even if they withhold their votes on a particular bill.|$|E

50|$|Partial <b>block</b> <b>voting,</b> {{also called}} limited voting, {{functions}} similarly to plurality-at-large voting, however in partial <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> each voter receives fewer votes {{than the number}} of candidates to be elected. This in turn can enable reasonably sized minorities to achieve some representation, as it becomes impossible for a simple plurality to sweep every seat. Partial bloc voting is used for elections to the Gibraltar Parliament, where each voter has 10 votes and 17 seats are open for election; the usual result is that the most popular party wins 10 seats and forms the ruling administration, while the second most popular wins 7 seats and forms the opposition. Partial <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> is also used in the Spanish Senate, where there are 4 seats and each voter receives 3 <b>votes.</b> Historically, partial <b>block</b> <b>voting</b> was used in three- and four-member constituencies in the United Kingdom, where voters received two votes, until multimember constituencies were abolished.|$|R

50|$|The Electoral base is non-uniform, {{and there}} may be {{institutional}} votes, individual votes or a mixture of both. Approximately one third of members are theoretically returned each by corporate block vote only, a mixture of corporate and individual votes, and individuals only.

Fourteen seats were uncontested in 2008; of the 16 contested seats, the number of electors, corporate and individuals combined, ranged from between 112 and 52,894 voters. Four of the FC legislators - mostly those returned in fiercely contested elections - are aligned with the parties which support universal suffrage; two are independent and the rest (24) are pro-government.|$|E
50|$|In 1981 the St Ermins {{group of}} senior trade union leaders was created, meeting {{secretly}} every month initially at the St Ermin's Hotel, who organised {{to prevent the}} Bennite left taking over the party. Four MPs also attended, Denis Howell, John Golding, Denis Healey and Giles Radice. The group was created following the 1981 special conference decision to establish an electoral college (40% trade unions, 30% members, 30% MPs) to elect the Labour Party leader and deputy rather than the Parliamentary Labour Party choosing. A major effort of the group was to use union <b>block</b> <b>votes</b> to overturn the left's majority on the Labour National Executive Committee and the Trades Union Congress general council.|$|E

50|$|Gaitskell took on Frank Cousins {{and wanted}} to show that Labour were a party of government, not just of opposition. At the October 1960 Scarborough Conference two resolutions in favour of {{unilateral}} disarmament - proposed by the TGWU and the Engineers’ Union - were carried, whilst the official policy document on defence was rejected. Gaitskell roused his supporters by promising to “Fight and Fight and Fight Again” to reverse the decision. Labour doctrine was that the Parliamentary Party had discretion over the timing of implementation of conference policy. In practice, in the 1940s and '50s, the unions, whose <b>block</b> <b>votes</b> dominated conference, had been broadly supportive of the PLP, but this was now beginning to change.

50|$|The {{traditional}} {{procedure in}} the Labour Party {{called for the}} leadership of trade unions to cast all the votes of their membership as a bloc, often in the tens or hundreds of thousands. They gained enormous leverage. However, until 1981, the system for choosing the party leader was by a secret ballot of Labour MPs. One-member, one-vote for {{the election of the}} party's leader was first proposed at Labour's Wembley Special Conference in 1981, but was opposed by Tony Benn, who instead initiated an Electoral College comprising different interest groups in the party: a trade union section comprising 40% of the total vote, consisting of <b>block</b> <b>votes</b> cast by union General Secretaries, another section of 30% comprising the Parliamentary Labour Party (Labour MPs) and a further 30% for active party members in Constituency Labour Parties (CLPs). Party leader Neil Kinnock attempted, but failed, to introduce one-member, one-vote in 1984. As party leader, John Smith made the first successful moves in partially introducing a new one-member, one-vote system, by abolishing the trade union block vote in the selection of Labour parliamentary candidates, and by giving union members paying the political levy (in the trade union section of Labour's Electoral College), a direct vote in the party's leadership elections. He introduced the change at the Labour Party Conference in 1993, and was verbally supported in winning votes for it at the Conference by then-Shadow Cabinet member John Prescott. In 1994, Labour's new leader, Tony Blair, was elected in the trade union section of the Electoral College under the one-member, one-vote system initiated by his predecessor, but the change in the selection of the party leader, through a complete one-member, one-vote voting system, was not taken until 2014, when it was introduced by Labour leader Ed Miliband. All Labour Party members are also entitled to vote for the Leader and Deputy Leader of the party as part of an electoral college which includes members of Parliament (MPs), members of the European Parliament and trade unions. For the 2015 leadership election, a true one-member, one-vote system (as originally proposed by both Neil Kinnock and John Smith) was used for the first time.|$|E
