While there have been previous studies on us-ing supervised approaches to segmentation {{of clinical}} texts, these existing approaches were trained and tested on a fairly limited data set showing low adaptibility to new unseen documents. We propose a highly generalized supervised model for segmenting clinical texts, based on a set of line-wise predictions by a classifier with constraints imposing their coherence. Evaluation results on 5 independent test sets show that our approach can work on all sorts of note types and performs consistently across enterprises. I...|$|R

40|$|The Atlantic Container Line, being a {{maritime}} carrier of goods, {{introduced a new}} transportation document, which needs some explanations and a juridical analysis. The new document consists of two seperate documents: in the port of loading the shipper of the goods receives a freight receipt, in which all particulars concerning the goods and its transport are duly given. The shipper has a choice: instead of such a freight receipt he may ask for a normal <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. But the conditions of carriage are the same both according to the freight receipt as well as according to the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. There is only one major difference: the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading may be delivered {{to the order of}} the shipper or to the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading holder, whereas the freight receipt must bear the exact name of the consignee. In consequence the freight receipt is not a document which entitles its holder to dispose of the cargo. The freight receipt is delivered to the shipper and remains in his hands. The freight receipt is being drawn up by the carrier or his agent in the port of loading on a telex apparatus, which has a connection with the carrier's agent apparatus at the port <b>of</b> <b>discharge.</b> There, at the same time, a „notice of arrival" is being written by the telex receiver apparatus. This notice of arrival (of the cargo) is being delivered to the consignee, who with that document in hand may take delivery of the cargo. The whole terminology is a new one. Maritime law does not know a freight receipt (it knows merely a mate's receipt which has other functions) nor a notice of arrival of the cargo in form of a document of title. And therefore the legal status of these two documents, considered together as one document of transport, must be found. According to Polish civil law the two mentioned documents together may be identified with a freight bill, a document which is being met with in other branches of the transportation industry. The prefix „telex" should denote that the document is not transferred in its material form (as a piece of paper) but on„wires" with the aid of electronic apparatus. At the port <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> the document is being drawn up once more. This facilitates enormously maritime trade if and when a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is not needed. And a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is not needed when the partners of the selling contract are in constant contact and have a full confidence that the contract will be fulfilled in the agreed manner and time. Such a situation may be found in relations between enterprises of socialist countries. Therefore the maritime telex freight bills could be successfully used in these countries.

50|$|When the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading {{is used as}} a {{document}} of title, it is particularly related to the case of buyer. When the buyer is entitled to received goods from the carrier, <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in this case performs as document of title for the goods. There are two types <b>of</b> <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that can perform as document of title. They are straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading issued to a named consignee that is not negotiable. In this case, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading should be directed only to one specific consignee indicated on the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is the opposite from a straight <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading and there is no specific or named consignee. Therefore, an order <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading can be negotiated to a third party.|$|R

40|$|Background: Avoidable {{hospital}} readmission is a {{focus of}} quality improvement efforts. The effectiveness of individual elements <b>of</b> the standard <b>discharge</b> process in reducing rehospitalisation is unknown. Methods: The authors conducted a case-control study of 1039 patients experiencing rehospitalisation within 30 days <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> and 981 non-rehospitalised patients matched on admission diagnosis, discharge disposition, and severity of illness. In separate models for each discharge process component, the authors measured the relationship between readmission and discharge summary completion, contents <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> summary, completion <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> instructions, contents <b>of</b> <b>discharge</b> instructions, presence <b>of</b> caregiver for <b>discharge</b> instruction, completion <b>of</b> medication reconciliation, and arrangement of ambulatory follow-up prior to discharge. Results: Adjusting for patient and hospital characteristics, including severity <b>of</b> illness and <b>discharge</b> disposition, the study failed to find an association between readmission and most components <b>of</b> the <b>discharge</b> process.

50|$|Some clauses {{specify the}} amount of freight to pay and the manner and time of payment. A clause may specify the length of time, usually {{described}} as lay days, for loading and discharging, and for the demurrage to pay if the vessel is detained beyond the lay days. There is usually also a clause that requires that the merchant bear the risk and expense to bring the cargo to the ship and collect it on delivery. Another clause specifies that the master must sign <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading for the cargo, either {{at the same rate}} payable under the charter-party, or commonly at any rate of freight (with a stipulation that, if the total <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading freight is less than the total freight payable under the charter-party, the charterers pay the difference to the master before the vessel sails). There is usually what is called the cesser clause, by which the charterer's liability under the charter-party ceases on shipment of the cargo, the shipowner taking a lien on the cargo for freight, dead freight, and demurrage. The charter-party is subject to exceptions similar to those in <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading. Typically, other clauses provide for commissions paid to the brokers on signing the charter-party, the address commission paid to the agents for the Vessel at the port <b>of</b> <b>discharge,</b> and other details.

40|$|LL. D. The <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in South African law is {{the theme}} of this study. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading in its {{traditional}} paper form is examined. The aim of the first part of the study is to reconcile the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that is based on English law with the principles of South African law, especially regarding concepts such as possession and ownership. A plea is made for the application of South African law to <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading rather than English law exclusively. Even though English law undoubtedly forms the basis of the law governing <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading, such law should be applied in a way that is consistent with the general principles of South African law. The functions <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading are considered in detail, particularly the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading as a document of title. A submission is made of five characteristics of a document of title. The conclusion is that the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, though based on English law concepts, can be integrated into South African law without difficulty. The subsequent examination of the transfer of contractual rights and the imposition of liabilities will show that there is a dire need for new legislation in South Africa to replace an English Act of 1855. The current proposals for such legislation are, however, in need of extensive revision. The fact that the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading only arrives at the port of destination after the goods, leads to a multitude of problems. The carrier may only deliver the goods in exchange for a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Letters of indemnity are therefore used to protect the carrier that delivers the goods without receiving a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. Such indemnities will be enforceable in South African law if the carrier has no reason to suspect that the receiver of the goods is not entitled to delivery. The consideration of the nature and functions <b>of</b> the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, enables the study to progress to an examination <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. The use <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading means that many problems facing the traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading can be avoided. The continuing evolution <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading will be examined against the background of electronic commerce. Writing and signature requirements should not inhibit the development <b>of</b> an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. The difficulty facing the dematerialisation <b>of</b> the <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is providing for negotiability in an electronic environment, and ensuring that an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading is the equivalent of an original and unique paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is possible to create an electronic <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading that performs all the functions <b>of</b> a traditional <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading, and there are examples of the use <b>of</b> such electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading in practice. Delivery of the goods can take place by way of attomment rather than the usual symbolical delivery following the transfer <b>of</b> a paper <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> lading. It is submitted that there is currently no need for legislative intervention to provide for electronic <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> lading in South Africa...|$|R
