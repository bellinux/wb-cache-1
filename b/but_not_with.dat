Laxa, General Mario Roatta (the commander of the Italian Second Army), and General der Artillerie Paul Bader (the commander of German forces in the NDH) negotiated a compromise permitting temporary non-political agreements to be concluded with the Herzegovinian Chetniks, led by Dobroslav Jevđević, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> any of the Bosnian Chetnik groups, whose leaders were Petar Baćović in the area of Foča and Jezdimir Dangić, who was aligned with the Serb collaborationist Milan Nedić.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea into species is also controversial. Biology defines a species {{as a group}} of related organisms. The familiar exclusive breeding criterion (organisms that can breed with each other <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> others) is of no help here because archaea reproduce asexually.|$|E
5|$|The new reign was {{supported}} by the Whigs, who were mostly staunch Protestants. The Tories were suspected of supporting the Catholic Pretender James Francis Edward Stuart.

5|$|The wet nose, or rhinarium, is a trait {{shared with}} other strepsirrhines {{and many other}} mammals, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> haplorrhine primates. Although it is claimed to enhance the sense of smell, it is {{actually}} a touch-based sense organ that connects with a well-developed vomeronasal organ (VNO). Since pheromones are usually large, non-volatile molecules, the rhinarium is used to touch a scent-marked object and transfer the pheromone molecules down the philtrum (the nasal mid-line cleft) to the VNO via the nasopalatine ducts that travel through the incisive foramen of the hard palate.|$|E
5|$|Additional traits {{shared with}} other {{prosimian}} primates (strepsirrhine primates and tarsiers) include a bicornuate (two-horned) uterus and epitheliochorial placentation. Because their thumbs are only pseudo-opposable, making their movement less {{independent of the}} other fingers, their hands are less than perfect at grasping and manipulating objects. On their feet, they have a widely abducted hallux (first toe) which facilitates the grasping of tree limbs. A common misconception is that lemurs have a prehensile tail, a trait found only in New World monkeys, particularly atelids, among primates. Lemurs also rely heavily on their sense of smell, a trait shared with most other mammals and early primates, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the visually oriented higher primates. This sense of smell is {{important in terms of}} marking territory as well as provide an indication of whether or not another lemur is a viable breeding partner.|$|E
5|$|An ongoing {{question}} is whether RAD should {{be thought of as}} a disorder of the child's personality or a distortion of the relationship between the child and a specific other person. It has been noted that as attachment disorders are by their very nature relational disorders, they do not fit comfortably into noslogies that characterize the disorder as centered on the person. Work by C.H. Zeanah indicates that atypical attachment-related behaviors may occur with one caregiver <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> another. This is similar to the situation reported for attachment styles, in which a particular parent's frightened expression has been considered as possibly responsible for disorganized/disoriented reunion behavior during the Strange Situation Procedure.|$|E

5|$|In 1838 {{there was}} a new {{currency}} crisis, and the peso papel was devalued by 34%, and in 1839 when the peso papel lost 66% of its value. It was again devalued by 95% in 1845, and by 40% in 1851. The Alsina years, which coincided with the secession of Buenos Aires, saw an extremely poor economic performance. Efforts to fund extraordinary expenditure on the conflict between Buenos Aires and the other provinces of the Confederation caused the fiscal deficit to skyrocket. Similarly, the Confederation faced harsh economic conditions. Urquiza, president of the Confederation, issued the 'law of differential rights', benefiting the ships trading with the ports of the Confederation and <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> Buenos Aires.|$|E
5|$|Insofar as the hilly {{topography}} {{of the site}} would allow, the city was built on a Roman grid plan and settled with veterans who fought in the victorious legions and other foreign colonists. In the 2nd century CE, Emperor Hadrian built a grand theater in Neapolis that could seat up to 7,000 people. Coins found in Nablus dating to this period depict Roman military emblems and gods and goddesses of the Greek pantheon such as Zeus, Artemis, Serapis, and Asklepios. Neapolis was entirely pagan at this time. Justin Martyr {{who was born in}} the city c. 100 CE, came into contact with Platonism, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> Christians there. The city flourished until the civil war between Septimius Severus and Pescennius Niger in 198–9 CE. Having sided with Niger, who was defeated, the city was temporarily stripped of its legal privileges by Severus, who designated these to Sebastia instead.|$|E
5|$|It is ectomycorrhizally {{associated}} with several tree species and is symbiotic with them. In Europe, these include hardwood and, less frequently, conifer species. It appears most commonly under oaks, but also under beeches, chestnuts, horse-chestnuts, birches, filberts, hornbeams, pines, and spruces. In other areas, A.phalloides {{may also be}} {{associated with}} these trees or with only some species and not others. In coastal California, for example, A.phalloides is associated with coast live oak, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the various coastal pine species, such as Monterey pine. In countries {{where it has been}} introduced, it has been restricted to those exotic trees with which it would associate in its natural range. There is, however, evidence of A.phalloides associating with hemlock and with genera of the Myrtaceae: Eucalyptus in Tanzania and Algeria, and Leptospermum and Kunzea in New Zealand. This suggests the species may have invasive potential.|$|E

5|$|Protactinium is an {{actinide}} {{which is}} positioned in {{the periodic table}} {{to the left of}} uranium and to the right of thorium, and many of its physical properties are intermediate between those two actinides. So, protactinium is more dense and rigid than thorium but is lighter than uranium, and its melting point is lower than that of thorium and higher than that of uranium. The thermal expansion, electrical and thermal conductivities of these three elements are comparable and are typical of post-transition metals. The estimated shear modulus of protactinium {{is similar to that of}} titanium. Protactinium is a metal with silvery-gray luster that is preserved for some time in air. Protactinium easily reacts with oxygen, water vapor and acids, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> alkalis.|$|E
5|$|Some common {{structures}} {{are shown in}} figures 3 and 4, along with their lumped-element counterparts. These lumped-element approximations {{are not to be}} taken as equivalent circuits but rather as a guide to the behaviour of the distributed elements over a certain frequency range. Figures 3(a) and 3(b) show a short-circuit and open-circuit stub, respectively. When the stub length is λ/4, these behave, respectively, as anti-resonators and resonators and are therefore useful, respectively, as elements in band-pass and band-stop filters. Figure 3(c) shows a short-circuited line coupled to the main line. This also behaves as a resonator, but is commonly used in low-pass filter applications with the resonant frequency well outside the band of interest. Figures 3(d) and 3(e) show coupled line structures which are both useful in band-pass filters. The structures of figures 3(c) and 3(e) have equivalent circuits involving stubs placed in series with the line. Such a topology is straightforward to implement in open-wire circuits <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> a planar technology. These two {{structures are}} therefore useful for implementing an equivalent series element.|$|E

5|$|The British {{official}} casualty return gave 15 killed, 46 {{wounded and}} 30 missing. As was often done in casualty returns with officers (<b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> enlisted men), Lieutenant King of Royal Artillery and Lieutenant Lamont of the 49th {{were included in}} the “wounded” category although they were also taken prisoner. The Americans took 34 prisoners, including Lamont and King, which would indicate that two of the enlisted men who were thought to have been killed were in fact captured. This gives a revised British loss (with Lamont and King counted among the prisoners rather than the wounded) of 13 killed, 44 wounded and 34 captured.|$|E
5|$|Abelisauroids are {{typically}} {{regarded as a}} Cretaceous group, though the earliest abelisaurid remains are known from the Middle Jurassic of Argentina (classified as the species Eoabelisaurus mefi) and possibly Madagascar (fragmentary remains of an unnamed species); possible abelisaurid remains (an isolated left tibia, right femur and right tibia) were also discovered in Late Jurassic Tendaguru Beds in Tanzania. Abelisaurid remains are mainly known in the southern continents, which once made up the supercontinent of Gondwana. When first described in 1985, only Carnotaurus and Abelisaurus were known, both from the Late Cretaceous of South America. Abelisaurids were then located in Late Cretaceous India (Indosuchus and Rajasaurus) and Madagascar (Majungasaurus), which were closely connected {{for much of the}} Cretaceous. It was thought that the absence of abelisaurids from continental Africa indicated that the group evolved after the separation of Africa from Gondwana, around 100 million years ago. However, the discovery of Rugops and other abelisaurid material {{from the middle of the}} Cretaceous in northern Africa disproved this hypothesis. Mid-Cretaceous abelisaurids are now known from South America as well, showing that the group existed prior to the breakup of Gondwana. In 2014, the description of Arcovenator escotae from southern France provided the first indisputable evidence of the presence of Abelisaurids in Europe. Arcovenator presents strong similarities with the Madagascan Majungasaurus and Indian abelisaurids, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>with</b> the South American forms. Arcovenator, Majungasaurus and Indian forms are united in the new clade Majungasaurinae.|$|E
