5000|$|Cylinder <b>blown</b> <b>sheet</b> {{is a type}} of hand-blown window glass. It {{is created}} with a similar process to broad sheet, but larger {{cylinders}} are produced by swinging the cylinder in a trench. The glass is then allowed to cool before the cylinder is cut. The glass is then re-heated and flattened. The result is much larger panes and improved surface quality over broad sheet.|$|E

50|$|Blown {{plate was}} made by hand-grinding broad sheet glass. As the process was labour-intensive, and expensive, blown plate was mainly used for {{carriages}} and mirrors rather than in windows for buildings.Other methods for making hand-blown glass included: broad sheet, crown glass, polished plate and cylinder <b>blown</b> <b>sheet.</b> These methods of manufacture lasted {{at least until the}} end of the 19th century.

50|$|Glass {{comprising}} multiple {{layers of}} clear and (usually) red glass was known {{to exist in the}} 12th and 13th centuries. The manufacturing process is not known. Flashing was developed in the 15th century, and refers to the superimposition of a thin layer of coloured glass onto another coloured or uncoloured glass sheet. The procedure may have involved dipping a small sphere of molten glass into a molten uncoloured glass and blowing this into a cylinder form (the cylinder <b>blown</b> <b>sheet</b> process) which was then cut into sections and flattened in an annealing oven. Red, or ruby, copper-based glass, is usually flashed as the colour is too dense to be used alone. Other glass colours may also be flashed. These techniques could be remarkably sophisticated as demonstrated by 15thc. glass from the Carthusian Monastery of Pavia, where layered glasses of blue and violet; green and uncoloured; and red and uncoloured have been identified.|$|E
5000|$|Chance Brothers was {{amongst the}} {{earliest}} glass works {{to carry out}} the cylinder process in Europe, and the company became known as [...] "... the greatest glass manufacturer in Britain.". In 1832, it made the first British cylinder <b>blown</b> <b>sheet</b> glass using French and Belgian workers. In 1839, a further development named plate glass was patented by James Timmins Chance. In 1848 under the supervision of Georges Bontemps, a French glassmaker from Choisy-le-Roi, who had purchased the secret of the stirrer after the deaths of Pierre Louis Guinand and Joseph von Fraunhofer, the pioneers of the manufacture of high-precision lenses for observatory telescopes, a new plant was set up to manufacture crown and flint glass for lighthouse optics, telescopes and cameras. [...] Bontemps agreed to share the secret with Chance Brothers and stayed in England to collaborate with them for six years. Just three other companies in Britain made glass in the same way, Pilkington of St Helens, Hartleys of Sunderland and Cooksons of Newcastle. During 1832, Chance Brothers became the first company to adopt the cylinder method to produce sheet glass, and became the largest British manufacturer of window and plate glass, and optical glasses.|$|E
50|$|It {{is made by}} blowing {{molten glass}} into an {{elongated}} balloon shape with a blowpipe. Then, while the glass is still hot, the ends are cut off and the resulting cylinder is split with shears and flattened on an iron plate. The quality of broad sheet glass is not good, with many imperfections and mostly translucent. Due to the relatively small sizes <b>blown,</b> broad <b>sheet</b> was typically made into leadlights. The centerpiece was used for decoration in places where looking through the glass wasn't vital. If the piece was large, {{it was possible to}} see bubble tracks and strain lines.|$|R

According to the China Meteorological Administration, {{it was the}} earliest in the year a tropical cyclone had ever impacted China (the old record was for Typhoon Wanda on May 3, 1971). 42,000 residents were displaced {{in the aftermath of}} Neoguri. [...] 18 Chinese fisherman and 22 Vietnamese fisherman remain missing due to the storm.

60|$|The {{valley of}} the Rio Grande opened to view, wide near at hand in a great gray-green gap between the bare black mountains, narrow in the distance, where the yellow river wound away, glistening under a hot sun. Bo squealed in glee at sight of naked little Mexican {{children}} that darted into adobe huts as the train clattered by, and she exclaimed her pleasure in the Indians, and the mustangs, and particularly {{in a group of}} cowboys riding into town on spirited horses. Helen saw all Bo pointed out, but it was to the wonderful rolling valley that her gaze clung longest, and to the dim purple distance that seemed to hold something from her. She had never before experienced any feeling like that; she had never seen a tenth so far. And the sight awoke something strange in her. The sun was burning hot, as she could tell when she put a hand outside the window, and a strong wind <b>blew</b> <b>sheets</b> of dry dust at the train. She gathered at once what tremendous factors in the Southwest were the sun and the dust and the wind. And her realization made her love them. It was there; the open, the wild, the beautiful, the lonely land; and she felt the poignant call of blood in her--to seek, to strive, to find, to live. One look down that yellow valley, endless between its dark iron ramparts, had given her understanding of her uncle. She must be like him in spirit, as it was claimed she resembled him otherwise.|$|R
5000|$|Flashed glass- is glass {{which is}} made by dipping the blowing rod, or [...] "pontil", into one colour then a second, and {{sometimes}} a third, before <b>blowing</b> to a <b>sheet.</b> The resulting sheet has {{a thin layer of}} a darker colour [...] "flashed" [...] over a paler colour.

2500|$|Dundas was {{eventually}} forced to haul {{away from the}} Belleisle as night fell, and try to save his own ship.

Belleisle was also in a desperate situation, blown almost onto the breakers of the Spanish coast before her crew managed to wear her around. With difficulty she survived the night, and was found when the light came the next morning by Dundas, who had a line reattached. [...] He steered straight for Gibraltar, and came {{within sight of the}} rock by midday, despite having been fired on by the Spanish battery at Tarifa. Dundas took Naiad in and anchored at 1330 that afternoon, while the Belleisle was warped into the mole.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the problem of improving the lift characteristics of a supersonic wing at low speeds. Trailing edge split flaps, nose flaps, and boundary layer control were investigated singularly and together using the optimum configuration of each. Results indicate that the nose flap has an appreciable effect on preventing separation and thus increasing the lift. Split flaps give an increment of lift as would be expected. The boundary layer control consisted of <b>blowing</b> a <b>sheet</b> of high velocity air back over the top surface of the wing with very definite improvements of the lift and drag characteristics. The work on the blowing technique, it is suggested, indicates sufficient promise to warrant much further study. The relatively large increment of lift that {{can be attributed to the}} prevention of flow separation at high angles of attack suggests that such boundary layer control could be used to improve controlability and to delay the stall, particularly tip stall, of high speed aircraft with very large sweep back angles. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a thin sheet of viscous liquid levitating on an air cushion is studied. Experimentally, {{it is observed}} that, after an initial settling stage, a local disturbance grows, eventually leading to the <b>sheet</b> <b>blowing</b> up like a viscous balloon. We derive a dynamical model for the levitating sheet and propose a mechanism for {{the onset of the}} instability. This instability is driven by the local drainage of the sheet due to a growing disturbance on its lower surface and is moderated by surface tension, the bending stiffness of the sheet and advection in the air layer. The balance between these effects determines the most unstable wavelength and this is illustrated by some numerical simulations...|$|R
