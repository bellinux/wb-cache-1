The test generation task for the black-box model is more complicated, <b>because</b> <b>possible</b> realizations of the design {{must be taken into}} account.

On the basis of these results, an appropriate fault model responding to the complexity of the problem being solved can be selected. 1...|$|E
40|$|This work initiates an {{analysis}} of several cryptographic protocols from a rational point of view using a game-theoretical approach, which allows us to represent not only the protocols but also possible misbehaviours of parties. Concretely, several concepts of two-person games and of two-party cryptographic protocols are here combined in order to model the latters as the formers. One of the main advantages of analysing a cryptographic protocol in the game-theory setting {{is the possibility of}} describing improved and stronger cryptographic solutions <b>because</b> <b>possible</b> adversarial behaviours may be taken into account directly. With those tools, protocols can be studied in a malicious model in order to find equilibrium conditions that make possible to protect honest parties against all possible strategies of adversaries...|$|E
40|$|Fast {{ignition}} is {{an approach}} to inertial fusion in which precompressed fuel is ignited with an external heat source. This arrangement can, in principle, lead to higher gains than conventional ignition produced by stagnation of convergent flows. In addition, because ignition is separate from the implosion in fast ignition, hydrodynamic mix has less opportunity to quench ignition than in the conventional process. This paper introduces {{some of the basic}} ideas of fast ignition: ignition requirements, gain curves based on simple energetic models, and integrated gain models including hohlraum and implosion physics. <b>Because</b> <b>possible</b> gains in this approach are so large, it is possible to examine the use of fuels with small tritium fractions, the so-called "advanced fuels. " In addition, the historical background of this field is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Process {{monitoring}} (PM) {{for nuclear}} safeguards sometimes requires estimation of thresholds corresponding to small false alarm rates. Threshold estimation {{dates to the}} 1920 s with the Shewhart control chart; however, <b>because</b> <b>possible</b> new roles for PM are being evaluated in nuclear safeguards, it is timely to consider modern model selection options {{in the context of}} threshold estimation. One of the possible new PM roles involves PM residuals, where a residual is defined as residual = data − prediction. This paper reviews alarm threshold estimation, introduces model selection options, and considers a range of assumptions regarding the data-generating mechanism for PM residuals. Two PM examples from nuclear safeguards are included to motivate the need for alarm threshold estimation. The first example involves mixtures of probability distributions that arise in solution monitoring, which is a common type of PM. The second example involves periodic partial cleanout of in-process inventory, leading to challenging structure in the time series of PM residuals...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeWhen we {{published}} the diagnostic criteria for “ictal epileptic headache” in 2012, we deliberately and consciously chose to adopt restrictive criteria that probably underestimate the phenomenon, rather than spread panic among patients and physicians who {{are reluctant to}} accept this entity. MethodsHere we discuss four intriguing clinical cases to highlight why we believe, to this day, {{that it is necessary}} to follow these restrictive diagnostic criteria. ConclusionsEEG is not recommended as a routine examination for children diagnosed with headache, but it is mandatory and must be carried out promptly in cases of prolonged headache that does not respond to antimigraine drugs, if epilepsy is suspected or has been diagnosed previously. This is not a marginal or irrelevant question <b>because</b> <b>possible</b> isolated, non-motor, ictal manifestations should be taken into account before declaring that an epileptic patient is “seizure free” so as to ensure that any decision taken to suspend anticonvulsant therapy is safe...|$|E

Understanding and resolving these ethical dilemmas is an important factor determining the quality of the caring for the patient.

40|$|International audienceSolutions {{of mixed}} {{surfactants}} are often considered as solvent mixtures. Usually, mixed micellar aggregates are {{considered as a}} homogeneous mixture of solvents dispersed in a solution. But the transposition of the usual thermodynamic models of solvent mixtures to mixed micelles is not always so obvious. We discussed this point in this paper by considering several cases of surfactant mixtures. A major problem is to define the molar fraction of each surfactant in the aggregate especially when a charged surfactant is employed in the mixture, <b>because</b> <b>possible</b> dissociation {{of the components of}} the mixture must be considered in the bulk as well in the micelle. This definition is crucial especially for the characterization of the ideal behavior which is usually described by the Clint relation, {{as well as for the}} application of regular solution theory (RST) which is the most frequently applied model for interpreting the behavior of surfactant mixtures. We show in this paper how the definition of the molar fraction can change the equations and the interpretations...|$|E
40|$|A large {{class of}} estimators {{including}} maximum likelihood, least squares and M-estimators {{are based on}} estimating functions. In sequential change point detection related monitoring functions {{can be used to}} monitor new incoming observations based on an initial estimator, which is computationally efficient <b>because</b> <b>possible</b> numeric optimization is restricted to the initial estimation. In this work, we give general regularity conditions under which we derive the asymptotic null behavior of the corresponding tests in addition to their behavior under alternatives, where conditions become particularly simple for sufficiently smooth estimating and monitoring functions. These regularity conditions unify and even extend a large amount of existing procedures in the literature, while they also allow us to derive monitoring schemes in time series that have not yet been considered in the literature including non-linear autoregressive time series and certain count time series such as binary or Poisson autoregressive models. We do not assume that the estimating and monitoring function are equal or even of the same dimension, allowing for example to combine a non-robust but more precise initial estimator with a robust monitoring scheme. Some simulations and data examples illustrate the usefulness of the described procedures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn the European Monetary Union, the {{estimation}} {{and analysis of}} preference parameters in its members is of special interest <b>because</b> <b>possible</b> differences could help us to understand why a common monetary policy could have different effects on the different economies involved. In this paper we have focused our attention on the elasticity of intertemporal substitution, {{one of the key}} preference parameters in intertemporal macroeconomic models. Different studies have shown a possible underestimation of such elasticity for different countries. It is common practice to estimate the parameter using only non-durable goods and service consumption data, without referring to the service flows generated by durable consumption. This is only admissible if the intratemporal utility can be separated among the different consumption components. Our priority objective is therefore to test the assumption of intratemporal separability for a selection of European countries (Germany, Spain and France), and then to analyse the effect of durable consumption on the estimated values of the intertemporal elasticity of substitution of these countries, our ultimate goal. Knowledge of such elasticity will enable us to characterise how saving in these economies reacts to variations in the real interest rate...|$|E
