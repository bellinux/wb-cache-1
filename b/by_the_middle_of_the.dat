5|$|As {{in much of}} the UK, Leeds' {{housing stock}} had fallen into {{disrepair}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20th century.

5|$|By 1801 the {{population}} of the Minster-in-Sheppey parish, which included both Sheerness and the neighbouring town of Minster, reached 5,561.

5|$|By the 1880s the {{influence}} of the Sheffield FA started to wane. Internal troubles began to surface with disputes between the SFA and a new rival association, Hallamshire F.A.

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 14thcentury, the westernmost Mongol territories {{had become}} subject to {{frequent}} Polish and Hungarian military offensives.

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 17th {{century the}} growing {{power of the}} Dutch Empire forced the British to acquire a station in western India.

Even after the treaty, some villages in Bombay remained under Portuguese possession, but many were later acquired by the British.|$|E

5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 18th century, Bombay {{began to}} grow into a major trading town, and {{received}} a huge influx of migrants from across India. Later, the British occupied Salsette on 28 December 1774. With the Treaty of Surat (1775), the British formally gained control of Salsette and Bassein, resulting in the First Anglo-Maratha War. The British were able to secure Salsette from the Marathas without violence through the Treaty of Purandar (1776), and later through the Treaty of Salbai (1782), signed to settle {{the outcome of the}} First Anglo-Maratha War.|$|E
5|$|<b>By</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 19th century, the Empire of Brazil was {{the richest}} and most {{powerful}} nation in Latin America.

During the minority of emperor PedroII in the 1830s, however, there had been internal rebellions driven by local disputes for power within a few provinces. One of these, the Ragamuffin War, had been led by Gonçalves, as noted above.|$|E

By 2005 and 2006, McCain was pushing for amendments to the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act that would limit creation of off-reservation casinos, as well as limiting the movement of tribes across state lines to build casinos.|$|E
