The Weavers, a half-timbered house by the river, {{was the site of}} a weaving school from the late 16th century to about 1830. (It has been adapted as a restaurant—see illustration above. The house derives its name from a weaving school which was moved there {{in the last years of}} the 19th century, reviving an earlier use.) Other refugees practised the variety of occupations necessary to sustain the community as distinct from the indigenous population. Such economic separation was the condition of the refugees' initial acceptance in the City. They also settled elsewhere in Kent, particularly Sandwich, Faversham and Maidstone—towns in which there used to be refugee churches.|$|E
500|$|The midden closet was a {{development}} of the privy, which had evolved from the primitive [...] "fosse" [...] ditch. [...] Midden closets were still used {{in the latter part}} of the 19th century but were rapidly falling out of favour. [...] A Mr Redgrave, in a speech to the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1876, said that the midden closet represented [...] "... the standard of all that is utterly wrong, constructed as it is of porous materials, and permitting free soakage of filth into the surrounding soil, capable of containing the entire dejections from a house, or from a <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses,</b> for months and even years". [...] The 1868 Rivers Pollution Commission reported two years later: [...] "privies and ashpits are continually to be seen full to overflowing and as filthy as can be...These middens are cleaned out whenever notice is given that they need it, probably once half-yearly on an average, by a staff of night-men with their attendant carts." ...|$|E
500|$|After that, the Rusticucci's heirs {{sold the}} {{building}} to Mario Accoramboni, member {{of a family of}} lesser nobility which had emigrated from the umbrian town of Gubbio to Rome. Exponents of the family acquired a high rank in the church and in the city: Ottavio was bishop of Fossombrone and Urbino, Roberto vicelegato at Ferrara, and during the epidemic of 1657, the owner of the palace, Roberto Accoramboni, received the task (personally given by Pope Alexander VII) of defending Borgo from the plague. In 1667, the erection of the Colonnades of St. Peter's square by Gian Lorenzo Bernini made it necessary to demolish the last <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> ("isola") in front of the new square, situated between the roads of Borgo Vecchio and Borgo Nuovo: this block was named [...] "isola del Priorato", since one of ıts buildings hosted the Priory of the knights of Rhodes. The demolition created a large new square, which was delimited on the north side by Palazzo Rusticucci. This square, representing the vestibule of Saint Peter's Square, took its name from the building.|$|E

In 1940 some blacks who lived as domestic workers resided in a single <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> {{in close proximity to}} their employers. Those houses were described by Jacalyn D.

2500|$|Trajano Alicorni {{left two}} sons, Giovanni Battista and Fabio, who were both {{appointed}} knights by the Pope. In 1585, Giovanni Battista sold the palace to the French Cardinal Matteo Contarelli, Datarius of Pope Gregory XIII (r. 1572–85). Some {{months later the}} prelate died, leaving the palace to his heirs, who sold it again to others who neglected the building, which fell into disrepair. In 1667, the erection of the Colonnades of St. Peter's square by Gian Lorenzo Bernini made it necessary to pull down the last <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> ("isola") {{in front of the}} new square: this was named [...] "isola del Priorato", since one of the buildings hosted the Priory of the knights of Rhodes. After the erection of the new square, Palazzo Alicorni faced at a very short distance the southern Colonnade in an incongruous position, being isolated on three sides, with Piazza Rusticucci (the new vestibule of St. Peter's square, created through the demolition) to the north, via del Sant'Uffizio to the west, and the short, crooked lane named [...] "Vicolo di Messer Traiano" [...] (from Traiano Alicorni) to the east.|$|E

The French entered the western <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> {{at the same time}} and at [...] about [...] of the garrison surrendered. Conditions on the plateau were appalling, because bursting shells had disinterred the corpses of hundreds of French and German soldiers killed before the offensive. The French continued the advance from Carency towards Ablain, which suddenly caught fire, as the Germans withdrew to houses at the eastern fringe of the village. The French took [...] field artillery and machine-guns in the area. On Thursday 13 May, in heavy rain a German counter-attack on the Spur of the White Way was repulsed by machine-gun fire. By the morning of 14 May, the French had captured most of the Lorette Spur and Carency but not the intervening positions, from which flanking fire had stopped the XXXIII Corps from advancing on Souchez. On 15 May, another French attack on the Spur of the White Way failed and until 21 May, the French on the Lorette Spur consolidated, under fire from the German artillery at Angres and Liévin. In the valley, the Germans held on at the east end of Ablain and recaptured the church and cemetery.|$|E

60|$|Leaving {{the coach}} outside a little <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses,</b> the party reached a {{projecting}} point of land, where three Irish officers received them, and conducted {{them to a}} boat. Then, wrapped closely in cloaks from the chill morning air, they were rowed to the yacht, {{on the deck of}} which stood Lord and Lady Powys, Lady Strickland, Pauline Dunord, and a few more faithful followers, who had come more rapidly. There was no open greeting nor recognition, for the captain and crew were unaware whom they were carrying, and, on the discovery, either for fear of danger or hope of reward, might have captured such a prize.|$|E

In this case the <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> that comes between will be very high indeed on the side towards the lower street; so that you see buildings sometimes eight or ten stories high at one front, and only four or five on the other.

Her original timidity had grown with this concealment, and her light step and her little figure shunned the thronged streets while they passed along them.|$|E

60|$|The City of Philadelphia {{lies between}} the two rivers, the Delaware and the Schuylkill. Eight chief streets run from river to river, and twenty-four {{principal}} cross-streets bisect the eight at right angles. The cross-streets are all called by their numbers. In the long streets the numbers of the houses are not consecutive, but follow the numbers of the cross-streets; so that a person living on Chestnut Street between Tenth Street and Eleventh Street, and ten doors from Tenth Street, would live at No. 1010. The opposite house would be No. 1011. It thus follows {{that the number of}} the house indicates the exact <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> in which it is situated. I do not like the right-angled building of these towns, nor do I like the sound of Twentieth Street and Thirtieth Street; but I must acknowledge that the arrangement in Philadelphia has its convenience. In New York I found it by no means an easy thing to arrive at the desired locality.|$|E
60|$|We had not {{occupied}} {{this position}} long {{when it was}} discovered that our ammunition was growing low. I volunteered to go back (*2) to the point we had started from, report our position to General Twiggs, and ask for ammunition to be forwarded. We were at this time occupying ground off from the street, in rear of the houses. My ride back was an exposed one. Before starting I adjusted myself on the side of my horse furthest from the enemy, and with only one foot holding to the cantle of the saddle, and an arm over the neck of the horse exposed, I started at full run. It was only at street crossings that my horse was under fire, but these I crossed at such a flying rate that generally I was past and under cover of the next <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> before the enemy fired. I got out safely without a scratch.|$|E

A more fashionable neighbourhood, it is said, eighty years ago than now--never certainly a cheerful one--wherein a boy being born on St. George's day, 1775, began soon after to take interest in the world of Covent Garden, and put to service such spectacles of life as it afforded.|$|E

60|$|Civilised and {{innocuous}} existence has {{no doubt}} been a blessing to Algiers {{as well as to}} the entire Mediterranean, but it has not improved the picturesqueness of its aspect any more than the wild and splendid 'tiger, tiger burning bright,' would be more ornamental with his claws pared, the fiery gleam of his yellow eyes quenched, and his spirit tamed, so as to render him only an exaggerated domestic cat. The steamer, whether of peace or war, is a melancholy substitute for the splendid though sinister galley, with her ranks of oars and towers of canvas, or for the dainty lateen-sailed vessels, skimming the waters like flying fish, and the Frank garb ill replaces the graceful Arab dress. The Paris-like <b>block</b> <b>of</b> <b>houses</b> ill replaces the graceful Moorish architecture, undisturbed when the Calypso sailed into the harbour, and the amphitheatre-like city rose before her, in successive terraces of dazzling white, interspersed with palms and other trees here and there, with mosques and minarets rising above them, and with a crown of strong fortifications. The harbour itself was protected by a strongly-fortified mole, and some parley passed with the governor of the strong and grim-looking castle adjacent--a huge round tower erected by the Spaniards, and showing three ranks of brazen teeth in the shape of guns.|$|E
