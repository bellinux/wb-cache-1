5|$|The stadium {{will have}} wi-fi and 4G LTE {{in all its}} sectors. Using smartphones, the public will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> game {{statistics}} and watch replays that will be published on a website maintained by the stadium crew. A dedicated team will control centrally all the screens and scoreboards. Supporters will be monitored by a computer system connected to hundreds of security cameras. All services are contracted with Sonda IT.|$|E
5|$|The {{player has}} {{the option to}} choose which side they wish to command at the {{beginning}} of the game. If the German side is picked, the objective of the game is to evade the Royal Navy fleet by either sailing to Iceland or heading to the safety of Nazi occupied France. The player will only have the ability to control the Bismarck itself, and must defend themselves against Royal Navy and Royal Air Force attacks if compromised. If the British side is chosen, then the player must command the hunting Royal Navy fleet in order to search and destroy the Bismarck. To achieve both these ends, the player will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> an in-game command centre, which will give out alerts depending on the side chosen. If controlling the Bismarck, the player will be reported of hostile British U-boat sightings. If controlling the Royal Navy fleet, they will be told of radio intercepts, which will pinpoint the Bismarcks approximate location.|$|E
5|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{refined and}} expanded from the version they used in Awakening. The My Castle feature was suggested by Maeda {{as an alternative}} activity for players, {{and to provide a}} means for getting to know the main characters outside battle. The amount of content included in the feature made some staff comment that it could be its own game. The social elements of My Castle were originally going to be exclusive to StreetPass, but it was suggested that players in areas with low StreetPass activity should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the functions through a normal Internet connection. Some ideas thought up by Maeda for earlier titles, such as the Dragon Vein ability and the way skills were inherited by second generation characters, were also implemented. Due to the necessity for multiple versions, map designing became a larger task than anticipated, with very few maps being shared between versions. The Phoenix Mode was included to bring new fans into the series, a philosophy that they had neglected up until Awakening and improved for Fates. For {{the first time in the}} Fire Emblem series, the option for the main character to marry a character of the same sex was included: the potential male and female partners respectively appear in Conquest and Birthright, and both appear in Revelation. According to Nintendo, this move was done to reflect the diversity of their player base.|$|E

All BTC-3, CTC-3, BTC-4C, and BTC-4D coaches have restrooms. Trains usually {{have one of these}} cars adjacent to the locomotive, as that car will be platformed at all high level platforms regardless of length, and thus handicapped riders will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the restroom car.|$|E
25|$|Through its Milwaukee Wireless Initiative, {{the city}} has {{contracted}} with Midwest Fiber Networks to invest US$20 million in setting up a municipal wireless network city-wide. Under the plan, the city will designate numerous government and public service websites for free access, and city residents will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> unlimited content for a monthly fee. Full wireless coverage was expected by March 2008, but delays have been reported.|$|E

25|$|Woodworkers {{seem to be}} {{evenly divided}} {{on the subject of}} bench positioning. Some like to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> their benches from all sides, while others like their bench against a wall. The {{advantage}} of wall placement - besides the saved space - is that tools can be stored on the wall over the bench, within easy reach. This keeps the tool storage out of the way, and the tools can still be reached without turning around or bending down.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} best {{facilitate}} collaboration, quality, and continuity of services, the each card includes a standardized form of basic identification {{data for the}} holder, and indicates in which autonomic health service the person is enrolled. In particular, the cards incorporate a digital form of this information; health facilities throughout Spain have appropriate equipment to read the digital information from the cards. A cardholder should thereby <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> all the services of all relevant health professionals throughout the country.|$|E
25|$|Insurgent {{organizations}} may recruit {{members of}} the government's civil and security forces to their cause or {{to have their own}} members join them. In addition to being able to provide intelligence and possibly provide direct and indirect aid, doing so allows insurgent members to gain military training and skills which they would not otherwise <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access,</b> these members may then serve as a cadre to train other insurgents, those who rise high enough may become agents of influence.|$|E

25|$|Although {{increased}} flexibility {{could be}} obtained by keeping the system interoperable with the South African railway system, a strong case exists for keeping Gautrain separate from the existing network. According to the Gautrain planning and implementation study, an interoperable network may impact service delivery, increase the operating cost and tarnish Gautrain's image. Gautrain's rolling stock will be used only on the new tracks. An interoperable network might also increase safety requirements, as existing steam and diesel trains would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the new network.|$|E
25|$|The LCMs can {{be loaded}} from either of Canterburys two 60 tonne cranes or via the stern ramp. To aid stern ramp loading, the MRV is fitted with Flippers {{to ensure that}} the LCM are aligned with the MRV. A {{ballasting}} system is fitted to allow for safe operations during loading. Once loaded, the LCM can conduct over-the-beach landings, with the boats mainly intended to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> beaches in the Pacific where no port facilities are available, for example during humanitarian missions.|$|E
25|$|The Reform Party {{called for}} the {{privatization}} of various government services that the party believed could be better provided by the private sector. These government services included a number of state-owned corporations including Canada Post, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, and Petro Canada. The Reform Party suggested that Canada's government-funded universal health insurance system {{be replaced by a}} two-tier private and public health insurance system. Preston Manning asserted however that the Reform Party was committed to ensuring that all Canadians would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> health insurance and health services.|$|E

25|$|Podcasting {{provides}} {{professional development}} {{that can be}} accessed when it is needed. A resource directory of archived podcasts can be created and educators can select topics they need at the given time to fit the need of the moment and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> professional learning. In 2007 and beyond, professional development has been delivered in an on-demand and mobile format, greatly facilitated by the portability of podcasts. Podcasts appear to offer teachers convenient professional development opportunities and can give them the freedom to select what, when and where they learn.|$|E
25|$|The {{difficulty}} lies {{in creating}} schemes {{that are still}} secure, but do not require all n shares. For example, imagine that the Board of Directors of a company would like to protect their secret formula. The {{president of the company}} should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the formula when needed, but in an emergency any 3 of the 12 board members would be able to unlock the secret formula together. This can be accomplished by a secret sharing scheme with t = 3 and n = 15, where 3 shares are given to the president, and 1 is given to each board member.|$|E
25|$|The {{emergency}} telephone number is a special case in the country's telephone number plan. In the past, calls to the {{emergency telephone}} number were often routed over special dedicated circuits. Though {{with the advent of}} electronic exchanges these calls are now often mixed with ordinary telephone traffic, they still may <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> circuits that other traffic cannot. Often the system is set up so that once a call is made to an {{emergency telephone number}}, it must be answered. Should the caller abandon the call, the line may still be held until the emergency service answers and releases the call.|$|E

25|$|In March 2012, Virgin Media won an {{exclusive}} contract to provide Wi-Fi access to London Underground platforms until 2017. The company announced mobile internet at 80 stations by July 2012 and a further 40 stations {{by the end}} of 2012. The service, which gives access to mobile internet via a TfL portal offering travel, news and entertainment bulletins, will remain free for Virgin Media customers, along with customers of partnered companies, such as Vodafone and EE, after the 2012 Summer Olympics. Other users will only <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> a limited amount of free content on the TfL portal, with full mobile internet services offered on a pay-as-you-go basis.|$|E
25|$|The nearest {{airports}} to {{the city}} are the Norman Y. Mineta San Jose International Airport (SJC) and Reid-Hillview Airport in East San Jose, the latter which is for small private airplanes. Although Milpitas is bordered by the San Francisco Bay in the extreme northwest, that area is not accessible to ships and boats. But, someday if the un-incorporated city of Alviso becomes part of Milpitas, one would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> Alviso marina {{and it can be}} made as a boat launching spot. Being landlocked, the city depends on the Port of Oakland for oceangoing freight and on the Union Pacific Railroad for cargo transport.|$|E
25|$|Public accessibility: Its {{contents}} {{are reasonably}} {{accessible to the}} public, traditionally by the paper being sold or distributed at newsstands, shops and libraries, and, since the 1990s, made available over the Internet with online newspaper websites. While online newspapers have increased access to newspapers by people with Internet access, people without Internet or computer access (e.g., homeless people, impoverished people and people living in remote or rural regions may not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>access</b> the Internet, and thus {{will not be able}} to read online news). Literacy is also a factor which prevents people who cannot read from being able to benefit from reading newspapers (paper or online).|$|E
