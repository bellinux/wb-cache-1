500|$|Gibson {{was first}} {{introduced}} to locative media websites through links from a friend, and initially found the phenomenon to be [...] "excessively nerdy and very conceptual". Despite his finding compelling {{the idea of a}} digital grid mapping the surface of the earth, Gibson saw little storytelling traction in geocaching and geohacking, and instead reworked the material into the locative art of the novel. [...] "When I started, I thought that the 'locative art' stuff would work the way immersion technology did in my earlier fiction", he commented in a subsequent interview. [...] "Then I started liking that it wasn’t going to do that." [...] The conception of the artworks in the novel was derived from the lowbrow art movement, and was inspired by the movement's talismanic Juxtapoz, the only art magazine Gibson was reading regularly at the time. The novel exhibits Gibson's characteristic <b>brand</b> <b>awareness</b> (a key plot element of Pattern Recognition), which he honed while poring over catalogues of products as part of his writing process.
