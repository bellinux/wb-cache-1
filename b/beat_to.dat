5|$|Liverpool's {{opposition}} in the fourth round were Italian side Roma. The first leg was held at Roma's home ground the Stadio Olimpico, where Liverpool had won the European Cup twice in 1977 and 1984. Incidentally, Roma were the team Liverpool <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> win the European Cup in 1984. Liverpool were once again successful at the Stadio Olimpico, as they won 2–0 courtesy of two Michael Owen second half goals. The second leg at Anfield was a close affair. Roma scored in the 70th minute to take the lead, they now needed to score another goal to take the match into extra-time. They looked like they {{had the opportunity to}} do so, when the referee awarded a penalty {{towards the end of the}} match after he had adjudged that Markus Babbel had handled the ball. However, moments later, he reversed his decision and instead awarded Roma a corner-kick. Roma were unable to score the necessary goal following the incident and Liverpool progressed to the quarter-finals courtesy of a 2–1 aggregate victory.|$|E

25|$|The {{park was}} known as a {{location}} for clandestine meetings of homosexuals {{in the days before the}} decriminalization of homosexuality in Canada in the 1960s.

25|$|Before the meeting, Hengist {{ordered his}} {{soldiers}} to carry long daggers beneath their clothing. At the signal Nemet oure Saxas (get your knives), the Saxons fell upon the unsuspecting Britons and massacred them, while Hengist held Vortigern by his cloak. 460 British barons and consuls were killed, {{as well as}} some Saxons whom the Britons <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> death with club and stones. Vortigern was held captive and threatened with death until he resigned control of Britain's chief cities to Hengist. Once free, he fled to Cambria.|$|E
25|$|The genre {{features}} a distinctive record production style, drum machine-backed rhythms, an occasional saxophone-laced <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> give a jazz feel (mostly common in contemporary R songs {{prior to the}} year 1995) and a smooth, lush style of vocal arrangement. Electronic influences are becoming an increasing trend {{and the use of}} hip hop or dance-inspired beats are typical, although the roughness and grit inherent in hip hop may be reduced and smoothed out. Contemporary R vocalists are often known for their use of melisma, popularized by vocalists such as Michael Jackson, R. Kelly, Craig David, Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey.|$|E

25|$|The {{radial artery}} {{is the easiest}} to use to check the heart rate. However, in {{emergency}} situations the most reliable arteries to measure heart rate are carotid arteries. This is important mainly in patients with atrial fibrillation, in whom heart beats are irregular and stroke volume is largely different from one <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> another. In those beats following a shorter diastolic interval left ventricle doesn't fill properly, stroke volume is lower and pulse wave is {{not strong enough to}} be detected by palpation on a distal artery like the radial artery. It can be detected, however, by doppler.|$|E
25|$|Sebastian later {{stood by}} a {{staircase}} where the emperor was to pass and harangued Diocletian for his cruelties against Christians. This freedom of speech, {{and from a}} person whom he {{supposed to have been}} dead, greatly astonished the emperor; but, recovering from his surprise, he gave orders for his being seized and <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> death with cudgels, and his body thrown into the common sewer. A pious lady, called Lucina, admonished by the martyr in a vision, privately removed the body, and buried it in the catacombs at the entrance of the cemetery of Calixtus, where now stands the Basilica of St. Sebastian.|$|E
25|$|The brain {{analyzes}} the temporal (rhythmic) components {{of music in}} two ways: (1) it segments the ongoing sequences of music into temporal events based on duration, and (2) it groups those temporal events to understand the underlying <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> music. Studies on rhythmic discrimination reveal that the right temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal segmenting, and the left temporal auditory cortex is responsible for temporal grouping. Other studies suggest the participation of motor cortical areas in rhythm perception and production. Therefore, a lack of involvement and networking between bilateral temporal cortices and neural motor centers may contribute to both congenital and acquired amusia.|$|E

Subsequently Vučković and his companions visited Čelopek almost every night to beat, torture and kill prisoners. On 27 June 1992, Vučković fired a machine gun at prisoners at random, killing twenty-five. The prison was closed two days later, and eighty-four survivors were transferred via Zvornik to the Batković concentration camp, near Bijeljina.|$|E

In their opening match in Nantes on 9 September the Canadians lost 42–17 to Wales. They followed this with a 29–16 loss to Fiji, whom they had needed to <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> have realistic hopes of progressing to the Quarter Finals. They drew 12–12 with Japan in Bordeaux, conceding an injury-time try by Koji Taira. In their final game they lost 37–6 to an Australian side consisting mostly of second-string players. It meant they finished bottom of Pool B, and returned home from a World Cup without winning a single game {{for the first time}} ever.|$|E

Her next opponent was Stosur, whom she <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> reach the final, a match against Azarenka for the world No. 2 ranking, which Kvitová won in three sets. She ended the year only 115 points second to Wozniacki for the No. 1 spot. She concluded 2011 by helping the Czech Republic win its maiden Fed Cup title as an independent nation, winning her singles rubbers against Maria Kirilenko and Svetlana Kuznetsova. In the end, the Czechs emerged victorious against Russia 3−2. She was also named WTA Player of the Year, WTA Most Improved Player of the Year and ITF Women's World Champion in 2011.

25|$|Straight away Munroe {{obtained}} a few lumps of black graphite which he <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated {{to the top}} of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker’s squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually he figured a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into a slotted line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs—but it was fine enough to write with.|$|E
500|$|While Hemingway {{painstakingly}} describes seemingly extraneous minutiae from Nick's fishing trip, he avoids or barely {{hints at}} {{the driving force of}} the work: the emotional turmoil wrought on Nick by his return home from a catastrophic war. Hemingway has said he believes this avoidance made the heart and thrust of the story all the more acute, writing [...] "'Big Two-Hearted River' is about a boy <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> the wide coming home from the war.... <b>beat</b> <b>to</b> the wide was an earlier and possibly more severe form of beat, since those who had been were unable to comment on this condition and could not suffer that it be mentioned in their presence.

50|$|Also processional, {{but for a}} {{different}} reason, is the march. Marches exist in various styles and tempi, and include the concert march, which {{is directly related to}} the military march, but is a military style symphonic piece to be listened to, rather than have any practical value. The standard 'Quick March' tempo varies from between 116 <b>beats</b> <b>to</b> 120 per minute, to accompany the disciplined way of moving men from one place to another. Marches may also be triumphant. Marches are written in four <b>beats</b> <b>to</b> the bar, two <b>beats</b> <b>to</b> the bar, and in 6/8 time, which is an elaborate or stylized version of two beats, or steps (and also used to accompany the 'Two Step' on the dance floor).|$|R
