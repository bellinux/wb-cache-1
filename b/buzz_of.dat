5|$|Around {{the time}} as he was collaborating with Stipe, and while still a member of Oh-OK, Sweet began writing songs for another project, the <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> Delight, which {{consisted}} of Sweet and former Oh-OK drummer David Pierce. In October 1983, they recorded a six-song EP, Soundcastles, released {{in the spring of}} 1984 on DB Records, and performed in New York, Florida and Georgia State to promote it. In the summer and November 1984, the <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> Delight recorded more songs, none of which were immediately released. (In 1990, one previously unreleased <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> Delight track appeared on the DB Records compilation Squares Blot out the Sun, and, in 2002, three others on To Understand.) Meanwhile, Stipe continued his work with R.E.M., who were getting acclaim and success with their album Murmur. In 1983, it was named album of the year by Rolling Stone and Trouser Press, and by the middle of 1984, it had sold 200,000 copies. In November 1983, R.E.M. began recording their follow-up, Reckoning.|$|E
25|$|Herdla was raided by the No. 114 Squadron RAF {{as part of}} Operation Archery on 27 December 1941. In {{addition}} to severe damage to the infrastructure, one Messerschmitt was destroyed during take-off. Herdla was again bombed by the RAF on 7 January 1942, although without the aircraft hitting their targets. All Bf109Ts were replaced with Bf109Es in January 1942. Herdla became part of JG5 when it was established in January 1942. This was followed up with dispatching several Kriegsmarine ships to Northern Norway, including the battleship Tirpitz, to counteract the Arctic convoys, creating a <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> activity for Herdla.|$|E
25|$|Ben Land snr., private trainer to Lord Poulett at Droxford, {{had decided}} to retire in 1870, and Chris Green was persuaded {{to take his place}} in Hampshire in September 1870 where he took charge of such horses as Benazet, Cortolvin and The Lamb. He was given the task of {{preparing}} The Lamb, a little iron grey Irish horse, for a second Grand National win and during the winter 'Lord Poulett and his party were exceedingly sanguine of success, and his Lordship caused a private circular to be distributed among his friends telling them to back The Lamb to win'. For the race itself, The Lamb, unseen in public for exactly two years, was paraded by Ben Land jun. and 'was greeted with a <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> admiration, aroused by his beautiful appearance and condition... No horse in the world could have looked better than The Lamb did'. This testament to Green's work continued in the race as The Lamb kept ahead of the pursuing horses to finally win by a couple of lengths in 'a desperately exciting finish'.|$|E

25|$|Originally Edwin {{planned to}} launch five stores in key cities like London, but {{although}} they signed an initial deal on 4 June 1990 that was ratified that October, Edwin did not {{gain control of}} the Fiorucci assets until May 1992. In fact they would later lose the rights to the Fiorucci name in Canada on the grounds of disuse. However, one of Edwin's first acts was a deal with Coles Myer that would see 68 Fiorucci concessions in stores across Australia. They opened a new store in Piazza San Babila, Milan in early 1993, that included a variety of branded boutiques. It took them longer to get things going in North America, after a 1993 deal with Mary Ann Wheaton of Wheaton International fell through. In 1995 they licensed the rights for eyewear in the US to Swan International Optical, and then opened a US office in September 1997. However, the strategy of their licensee, Stephen Budd, to sell the brand into US department stores didn't work out so in 1999 they announced a plan to open a New York store once again. The initial plan was to open in time for Christmas 1999, but the store on lower Broadway finally opened its doors in June 2001. Commentators such as Kim Hastreiter were sceptical that it could recapture the <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> times past, given the increased competition in mass-market clubbing gear from the likes of H and The Limited.|$|E
25|$|In 2009, the Buzz {{continued}} its practice of passing on drafting a marquee player. Despite being the defending WTT champions, the Buzz did not protect {{any of their}} players from the previous year's team. Instead, it drafted four new players in the roster draft and put together the youngest team in WTT history. In the order selected, the players drafted by the Buzz and their ages {{at the time were}} Sloane Stephens, 16, Christina McHale, 16, Evan King, 17, and Alex Domijan, 17. Roger Smith, who played for the OTBzz in their inaugural 1995 season was named the new Buzz coach. After the roster draft, Buzz owner Nitty Singh said, “We are extremely excited to showcase America’s finest juniors on our New York Buzz team this season. This keeps with our tradition of presenting the game’s future stars such as Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras and Lindsay Davenport who also played tournaments here in the Capital Region during the early part of their careers.” With three of their four regular full-time players having other commitments during the season, none of them other than Domijan were able to play in every match. The Buzz ended up using 13 different players in 2009, all of which were young amateurs. The optimism {{at the outset of the}} season evolved into the chaos of a rotating door through which players came and went resulting in a record for the <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> 4 wins and 10 losses, fourth in the Eastern Conference and barely avoided a last place finish by winning a standings tiebreaker over the Philadelphia Freedoms.|$|E

500|$|Aside {{from the}} effects, the soundtrack was remixed. Ambient noise {{such as the}} <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> bridge {{controls}} were added to enhance certain scenes. Goldsmith had always suspected that some overly long cues could be shortened, so he made the cues repetitive. Although no new scenes were added, the MPAA rated the revised edition [...] "PG" [...] {{in contrast to the}} [...] "G" [...] rating of the original release. Fein attributed the rating change to the more [...] "intense" [...] sound mix that made scenes such as the central part of V'Ger [...] "more menacing".|$|E

Edwards attended the University of Surrey, where he conducted the college orchestra along with an ensemble that he formed himself.

He held a lecturer position at Northwestern University in Chicago, where he was also a doctoral candidate. Four years later he moved to the Pacific Northwest.

500|$|As Russell concluded, {{to strong}} applause from gold delegates, {{there was a}} <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> {{anticipation}} as Bryan ascended to the podium. There was loud cheering as Bryan stood there, waiting for his audience to calm. Bryan's lecture tours had left him a well-known spokesman for silver. As yet, {{no one at the}} convention had effectively spoken for that cause, which was paramount to the delegates. According to political scientist Richard F. Bensel in his study of the 1896 Democratic convention, [...] "Although the silver men knew they would win this fight, they nonetheless needed someone to tell them—and the gold men—why they must enshrine silver {{at the heart of the}} platform." [...] Bensel noted, [...] "The pump was more than primed, it was ready to explode." [...] Bryan would say little that he had not said before—the text is similar to that of a speech he had given the previous week at Crete, Nebraska—but he would give the convention its voice.|$|E

She also appreciated the use of audio to tell the story: the <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> a surgeon's saw or the sound of skin stuck to leather. Keith Phipps of The A.V.

500|$|Sweet began {{distancing}} {{himself from}} {{other people in the}} Athens music scene and in 1984 quit Oh-OK; by 1985, the <b>Buzz</b> <b>of</b> Delight had broken up. That year, Sweet got a record deal with CBS Records and moved to New York City. He was accused of being opportunistic and using his Athens connections to get a record deal and leave. Sweet maintains that when he went to CBS, he never claimed {{to have anything to do}} with Athens, so that nobody could say he used the town. He says that after months of living in Athens, he realized things weren't as happy there as everyone pretended, and that there was backstabbing going on. In 1993, he said, [...] "Things really turned dark there when R.E.M. got famous, because everyone wanted that fame so bad. Maybe I wanted it too, but I had this musical goal all of my own and wasn't going to go along with the way it was done there." [...] Everybody was telling him that he should be touring and building up a following before doing his record, like R.E.M. had done. However, more than making the record itself and becoming a rock star, Sweet's main motivation was to get money to buy studio gear.|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Debut draws on an eclectic variety of sources. Treblezine {{described}} the album as [...] " [...] alternative dance and electronic with a graceful flow." [...] It {{is said that}} the album [...] " [...] the status quo" [...] of the contemporary musical climate, {{in the sense that}} its eclectic experimental pop leanings distanced it from the music [...] "primarily being made by men with guitars" [...] that was popular at the time, like grunge and the burgeoning britpop. Michael Cragg of The Guardian has described it as an [...] "indefinable conflation of electronic pop, trip-hop, world music and otherworldly lyrics". AllMusic described the album's style as [...] "creative, tantalizing electronic pop." [...] The New York Times review stated that [...] "Debut often recalls the early 70's jazz-fusion of bands like Weather Report. But where these fusionists combined jazz harmony with funk and acid rock, Björk marries her scat-vocalese and off-kilter melodies with the futuristic textures and programmed percussion of today's techno and acid house. [...] Furthermore, The Faces Mandi James felt Debut was [...] "a delightful fusion of thrash metal, jazz, funk and opera, with the odd dash of exotica thrown in for good measure." [...] The singer also took influence from the music of Bollywood and [...] "the <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> London nightlife." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{the popular}} {{music of the}} early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and {{engineers}} to freely experiment with musical form, arrangements, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects. Some {{of the best known}} examples are Phil Spector's Wall of Sound production formula and Joe Meek's use of homemade electronics for acts like the Tornados. XTC's Andy Partridge interprets the music of psychedelic groups as a [...] "grown-up" [...] version of children's novelty records, believing that many acts were trying to emulate those records that they grew up with; [...] "They use exactly the same techniques—sped-up bits, slowed-down bits, too much echo, too much reverb, that bit goes backwards. ... There was no transition to be made. You go from things like 'Flying Purple People Eater' to 'I Am the Walrus'. They go hand-in-hand." [...] Music critic Richie Unterberger says that attempts to [...] "pin down" [...] the first psychedelic record are therefore [...] "nearly as elusive as trying to name the first rock & roll record". Some of the [...] "far-fetched claims" [...] include the instrumental [...] "Telstar" [...] (produced by Meek for the Tornados in 1962) and the Dave Clark Five's [...] "massively reverb-laden" [...] "Any Way You Want It" [...] (1964). The first mention of LSD on a rock record was the Gamblers' 1960 surf instrumental [...] "LSD 25". A 1962 single by The Ventures, [...] "The 2000 Pound Bee", issued forth the <b>buzz</b> <b>of</b> a distorted, [...] "fuzztone" [...] guitar, and the quest into [...] "the possibilities of heavy, transistorised distortion" [...] and other effects, like improved reverb and echo began in earnest on London's fertile rock 'n' roll scene. By 1964 fuzztone could be heard on singles by P.J. Proby, and the Beatles had employed feedback in [...] "I Feel Fine", their 6th consecutive No. 1 hit in the UK.|$|E
