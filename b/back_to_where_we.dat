In Spider-Man 3, she sang two songs as Mary Jane Watson, one during a Broadway performance, and one as a singing waitress in a jazz club. Dunst revealed that she recorded the songs earlier and later lip-sync to it when filming began. She appeared in the music videos for Savage Garden's [...] "I Knew I Loved You", Beastie Boys' [...] "Make Some Noise" [...] and R.E.M.'s [...] "We All Go <b>Back</b> <b>to</b> <b>Where</b> <b>We</b> Belong" [...] and she sang two tracks which were [...] "This Old Machine" [...] and [...] "Summer Day" [...] on Jason Schwartzman's 2007 solo album Nighttiming.|$|E
500|$|... "You're Gonna Love Tomorrow" [...] {{was written}} by series creator and {{executive}} producer Marc Cherry and directed by Larry Shaw. Filming for the episode was scheduled to begin on July7,2008. The episode {{is the first to}} fully employ the five-year jump, which was introduced in the final two minutes of the fourth season finale. While developing the fifth season, Cherry began brainstorming ways to revamp the series. He stated: [...] "The soap tends to build up, and I wanted to get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were that very first season, where it's just the problems of some ordinary women and they were small and relatable." [...] Cherry credits the producers of Lost for the idea of the time jump. The writers hoped the time jump would also help them avoid repeating mistakes they made during the show's poorly received second season, during which they relied heavily on storylines from the previous season. Cherry said that the time jump would be permanent, with executive producer Bob Daily clarifying that some brief flashback scenes would be used to enhance the storytelling and provide context for current plot lines. [...] Cherry had originally wanted to do a ten-year jump, mostly to age the young characters into their teenage years in order to open up more storyline possibilities.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called the episode his eighth {{favorite of the}} show. He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode, as well as Lisa's self-referential quote about how, [...] "by next week, we'll be <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> started from, ready for another wacky adventure." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode had [...] "some great existential musings" [...] from Lisa. They added that it also [...] "contains some nice moments highlighting {{the differences between the}} Simpsons and the Flanders." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: [...] "I always remembered [...] to be a great episode – and I recalled correctly. Sure, the show goes with a less than creative presence; it’s an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways. However, the development of the theme is terrific, as we learn the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson." [...] DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade, claiming the [...] "rather large dose of sentimentality" [...] and [...] "fewer moments of absurdity" [...] in the episode gave it [...] "the feeling that it belongs in one of the series' earlier seasons". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme.|$|E

5000|$|On {{more than}} one {{occasion}} Gann has suggested that part of the reason the show had poor ratings in the US was because the show got bogged down in mythology and at times made comedy secondary stating, [...] "Season Three, we really tried <b>to</b> steer it <b>back</b> closer <b>to</b> <b>where</b> <b>we</b> were Season One, and make it really comedically satisfying.

40|$|At {{first glance}} {{you think that}} this is Christ crucified. At a second glance, you {{recognize}} a woman hanging on a cross.

St Wilgefortis or St Uncumber was a bearded and crucified woman who was venerated widely in northern Europe during the fifteeneth and sixteenth centuries. Wilgefortis is a corruption of the term „virgo fortis“ („strong virgin“). She and other female saints were considered as „imitations of Christ“. The paper deals with the reasons why this saint became so popular and how even today ideas about such strong virgins which mirror androgynous symbolism live on in popular culture...|$|R
