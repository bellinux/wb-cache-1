40|$|Reef sharks {{clean up}} with a novel inshore mutualistic {{interaction}} Parasite removal by cleaner fish provides significant health benefits {{to a variety of}} coral reef fish, particularly roving carnivores and herbivores (Grutter et al. 2003). For grey reef sharks (Carcharhinus amblyrhynchos), however, such cleaning events are only known to occur sporadically, on exposed oceanic reefs (O’Shea et al. 2010). This is because hosts on cleaning stations must remain relatively stationary (Côte ́ et al. 1998), a behaviour which requires constant current flow for grey reef sharks. Within the central region of Ningaloo Reef (S 23. 1, E 113. 8), an 8 -m-deep lagoonal Turbinaria coral bommie provides the only reported example of grey reef sharks utilising a shallow-water inshore cleaner fish station (Fig. 1 a). Here, sharks of both sexes up to 1. 8 m total length are cleaned by <b>blue-streak</b> cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus) and moon wrasse (Thal-assoma lunare).

50|$|There are {{estimated}} to be between 100,000 and 500,000 <b>blue-streaked</b> lories in the wild.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blue-streaked</b> lory {{is about}} 31 cm in length, {{including}} the tail. They weigh between 145 and 155 g.|$|R
50|$|The <b>blue-streaked</b> lory (Eos reticulata) is {{also known}} as the blue-necked lory. It is a {{medium-sized}} parrot (31 cm), which is found on the Tanimbar Islands and Babar in the southern Moluccas.|$|R
40|$|Two parrot species, Tanimbar corella Cacatua goffini and <b>blue-streaked</b> lory Eos reticulata, {{endemic to}} the Tanimbar Islands, Indonesia, were {{regularly}} trapped and sold {{into the international}} wild bird trade prior to 1992. Following concerns about numbers entering into the trade, but with little knowledge of the remaining wild population or socio-economic role of bird trapping on the islands, international trade in both species was suspended at the 1992 CITES meeting. This paper reports on a rapid survey conducted on the islands in 1993 as a follow-up to the decision on trade. The survey attempted to determine {{the status of the}} wild populations, the distribution and activity of the human population, the interaction between Tanimbar corella and agriculture, and the structure of the local commodity-chain for wild-caught parrots. We found that: (a) both parrot species were widely distributed and present at relatively high densities across the largest island in the group, Yamdena; (b) catching of parrots is geographically limited; (c) in the case of Tanimbar corella, at least, the catching is of birds raiding crops and probably involves mainly immature and non-reproductive birds; (d) the international and domestic ban on catching was generally adhered to locally but the reasons for the ban were not widely understood, contributing to a general mistrust of conservationists that still remains. Although not advocating a lifting of the ban on trapping, we do conclude that in this case invoking the precautionary principle without proper consideration of local context may have been counter-productive to conservation goals.

40|$|The {{survey was}} carried out to know {{some aspects of the}} bird trade in Bali on May 2002, {{especially}} to observe the diversity and abundance of species of Psittacidae Family along with their problems. The survey was done by direct observations and interview to the traders in the Sanglah and Satria Bird Markets, Denpasar-Bali. The total of 80 spescies of birds were traded in Bali and most of them i. e. : 75 species or 1577 individuals were found in the Satria bird market, but only 37 species or 393 individuals traded in the Sanglah bird market. Psittacidae family was found more abundantly, i. e. : 428 individiuals in 13 species of parrots. Those spesies of parrots were: Violet-necked Lory (Eos squamata), <b>Blue-streaked</b> Lory (E. reticulata), Red Lory (E. bornea), Rainbow Lorikeet (Trichoglossus haematodus), Chattering Lory (Lorius garrulus), Cockatail Australia (Nymphicus hollandicus), Moustached Parrakeet (Psittacula alexandri), Peach-faced Lovebird (Agapornis roseicollis), Fischerâ€™s Lovebird (A. fischeri), Masked Lovebird (A. personata), Bali Hanging Parrot (Loriculus pusillus) and Budgerigar (Melopsittacus undulatus). The Rainbow Lorikeet was found more abundant than another species of parrots, but Bali or Javan Hanging Parrot was very rare. The most catching area of Psittacidae was about 45...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] said Miss Garland, simply. They {{had reached}} a point where the wood-path forked and put forth two {{divergent}} tracks which lost themselves in a verdurous tangle. Miss Garland seemed to think that the difficulty of choice between them was a reason for giving them up and turning back. Rowland thought otherwise, and detected agreeable grounds for preference in the left-hand path. As a compromise, they sat down on a fallen log. Looking about him, Rowland espied a curious wild shrub, with a spotted crimson leaf; he went and plucked a spray of it and brought it to Miss Garland. He had never observed it before, but she immediately called it by its name. She expressed surprise at his not knowing it; it was extremely common. He presently brought her a specimen of another delicate plant, with a little <b>blue-streaked</b> flower. [...] "I suppose that 's common, too," [...] he said, [...] "but I have never seen it--or noticed it, at least." [...] She answered that this one was rare, and meditated a moment before she could remember its name. At last she recalled it, and expressed surprise at his having found the plant in the woods; she supposed it grew only in open marshes. Rowland complimented her on her fund of useful information.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of a {{close-up}} of a specimen of Scarlet larkspur (Delphinium cardinale), ca. 1920. A single branch is shown, its flowers slightly wilted and small. The branch is shown against a dark background, with a swath of lighter tone directly behind it.; "This is {{a large group of}} very beautiful annuals and perennials commonly called Larkspurs. The original or wild types from which the named varieties are descended are natives of California, Siberia, Syria and India. The Delphiniums mostly seen in gardens are hybrids of D. elatum and are clump-forming perennials that bloom from early to mid-summer. Their leaves are divided, lobed, and range from mid- to bright green. Hybrids of D. belladonna are also clump-forming perennials, but with more thin, wiry stems that produce branched spikes of spurred flowers. Dwarf annual Delphiniums are descended from D. Ajacis and tall annual Larkspurs from D. Consolida. The height of the different varieties ranges from 3 to 8 feet, with some dwarf varieties only growing up to 18 inches high. The flowers of these plants grow in long spikes. They are cup-shaped and may be single or double with colors ranging from creamy-whites through lilac-pinks to dark indigo-blue, usually with a contrasting "eye" formed by the inner sepals. D. 'Strawberry Fair' has large, semi-double, mulberry-pink flowers with white eyes on plants that grow 5 ½ to 6 feet high. D. 'Sungleam' has large, semi-double, white overlaid with pale yellow flowers with yellow eyes. D. 'Blue Nile' grows from 5 to 5 ½ feet high and produces large, semi-double rich, dark blue flowers with <b>blue-streaked</b> white eyes. D. grandiflorum 'Blue Butterfly' only grows 18 inches high and has single, dark blue flowers, growing 1 ½ inches across. They are produced in airy, branching spikes up to 6 inches long. The bright green leaves are palmately divided. D. 'Spindrift' is an interesting plant with large, semi-double flowers that grow in 3 -foot long spikes. They are a pinkish-lilac color overlaid with pale blue with creamy-white eyes, which have a deep blue center. On acidic soils, the petals become tinged with green. Other kinds will be described below in the varieties section. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
