5|$|With {{the breed}} that carries his name, John Sebright {{intentionally}} {{set out to}} create a very small <b>bantam</b> chicken with laced plumage similar to the laced variety of Polish chickens. Although the exact makeup of the breed is uncertain, he {{is thought to have}} crossed British, Hamburgh, Nankin and Polish birds with a base of Rosecombs before achieving a laced chicken that would breed true. After the breed's establishment circa 1810, Sebright founded The Sebright <b>Bantam</b> Club, which was the very first individual breed association for chickens. The breed has appeared in the American Poultry Association's Standard of Perfection since the first edition in 1874. Today, the breed is one of the ten most popular <b>bantam</b> chickens, according to the American <b>Bantam</b> Association.|$|E

5|$|Silkies are {{considered}} a <b>bantam</b> breed in some countries, but this varies according to region and many breed standards class them officially as large fowl; the <b>bantam</b> Silkie is actually a separate variety most of the time.
