5|$|The broad <b>bean</b> <b>weevil,</b> B. rufimanus is univoltine. It reproduces {{in spring}} in faba bean crops, lays eggs {{on the young}} pods, {{develops}} in the growing seeds and overwinters as adults in shelters, or in diapause as larva or pupa diapause in the stored seeds.|$|E
5|$|Bruchus rufimanus, {{commonly}} known as the broad <b>bean</b> <b>weevil,</b> broad bean beetle, or broad bean seed beetle is a weevil which inhabits crops and fields, as well as some homes. It is a pest of faba beans (Vicia faba L.).The adult weevils feed on pollen, while their larvae tunnel in seeds destroying crops and moving on to new ones once they dry out. The adult beetle, being one of the biggest of its genus, ranges from 3 to 5mm in length.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{transfer}} between species {{includes the}} formation of hybrid organisms and horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer is the transfer of genetic material from one organism to another organism that is not its offspring; this is most common among bacteria. In medicine, this contributes {{to the spread of}} antibiotic resistance, as when one bacteria acquires resistance genes it can rapidly transfer them to other species. Horizontal transfer of genes from bacteria to eukaryotes such as the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the adzuki <b>bean</b> <b>weevil</b> Callosobruchus chinensis has occurred. An example of larger-scale transfers are the eukaryotic bdelloid rotifers, which have received a range of genes from bacteria, fungi and plants. Viruses can also carry DNA between organisms, allowing transfer of genes even across biological domains.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bean</b> <b>weevils</b> {{develop and}} feed upon leguminous plants. Adult <b>bean</b> <b>weevils</b> {{hibernate}} inside the seeds or seed pods of these plants. [...] Adults emerge from hibernation in April to mate. Female <b>bean</b> <b>weevils</b> lay eggs onto seed pods, or into them by chewing holes, {{in groups of}} 2 to 20 eggs. A single female can lay up to 200 eggs. but 40 is average fecundity. Egg development can take 30 to 45 days before a 1st instar larvae merges. After approximately 3 days the larvae then moults and becomes a second instar larvae which then begin to consume the seed, with the larval stage lasting 3 to [...] weeks in total.The larvae then pupates inside the seed, taking 9 to 29 days.The life cycle of a single generation takes from 100 to 110 days. If the seeds are stored {{in a warm place}} multiple generations can be produced one after another.|$|R

50|$|The <b>bean</b> <b>weevils</b> or seed beetles are a {{subfamily}} (Bruchinae) of beetles, now {{placed in}} the family Chrysomelidae, though they have historically been treated as a separate family. They are granivores, and typically infest various kinds of seeds or beans, living {{most of their lives}} inside a single seed. The family includes about 1,350 species found worldwide.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bean</b> <b>weevils</b> {{are small}} beetles, {{ranging in size}} from 2 to 5 mm.They range in colour from light to dark brown, with {{longitudinal}} spots on their elytra, which has a red posterior border. Eleytra does not cover the abdominal end. Legs are yellow red and antenna red brown. The head is bent forward and lacks the long snout that is characteristic of true weevils.|$|R
50|$|The genus {{is part of}} the {{subfamily}} Bruchinae. Members of the subfamily {{are known}} commonly as <b>bean</b> <b>weevils.</b> Many authors prefer to call them seed-beetles or bean beetles, because they are not true weevils, and because in most species, the larvae develop inside seeds, particularly beans. Because Bruchinae was known as the family Bruchidae until the 1990s, they are sometimes still called bruchid beetles.|$|R

50|$|E. ebano is a {{host plant}} for the {{caterpillars}} of the Coyote Cloudywing (Achalarus toxeus) and Sphingicampa blanchardi. The seedpods host the <b>bean</b> <b>weevils</b> Stator beali and S. limbatus. Despite the native range of Texas Ebony overlapping {{with that of}} the latter, S. limbatus only feeds upon it in locales where it is grown as an ornamental and is not native. E. ebano is also a preferred host of the epiphyte Bailey's Ball Moss (Tillandsia baileyi).|$|R
50|$|This plant {{grows to}} about 7 m. It has light brown bark, usually short, {{straight}} spines 1 to 3 centimeters long, twice-compound leaves, and numerous small yellowish flowers appearing in elongate spikes. The tightly twisted seedpods (legumes) {{are up to}} 5 centimeters long and very much resemble turned screws. This morphology {{may have been an}} evolutionary defense against seed predators such as <b>bean</b> <b>weevils</b> (Bruchinae). The seeds germinate after being scarified in the digestive tracts of animals that eat them.|$|R
50|$|Several control {{methods are}} used to reduce the {{existing}} population {{and the spread of}} P. aculeata in Australia. Three insects have been introduced to Australia for biological control; the parkinsonia <b>bean</b> <b>weevils,</b> Penthobruchus germaini and Mimosestes ulkei, both have larvae that specifically eat the seeds from parkinsonia pods and are proving to be a useful management tool, and the parkinsonia leaf bug, Rhinacloa callicrates, which destroys photosynthetic tissues but has had little overall impact on the plant. Fire is effective for young trees; mechanical removal and herbicides are also used.|$|R

40|$|The two seed beetle species Acanthoscelides obtectus and Callosobruchus maculatus {{are among}} the {{economically}} most important pests of stored legume seeds world-wide. Insect natural enemies for biological control were considered in IPM strategies to control <b>bean</b> <b>weevils</b> in store. In this contribution, the control effect {{by a combination of}} the parasitoid Anisopteromalus calandrae and the predator Xylocoris flavipes on both seed beetle species was evaluated in a laboratory study on black eyed beans Vigna unguiculata. The combination of parasitoid and predator was most effective against both species of seed beetles. However, in C. maculatus the combination was not significantly more effective compared to A. calandrae alone, suggesting a poor effect on adults and no effect on eggs and larvae by X. flavipes. In the case of A. obtectus, the suppressive effect by the combination of the parasitoid and the predator was high. For C. maculatus, germination of black eyed beans was a pproximately three times higher when both natural enemies were present. The combination of A. calandrae and X. flavipes is considered a promising component for integrated control of A. obtectus...|$|R
