Binary logistic regression is recommended. The method was applied in a case study of New Zealand fatal crashes, with two main analysis techniques employed. Firstly, binary logistic regression models were developed. It was found that, for rural roads, sections with consistent and frequent curves were safer than completely straight sections or those with isolated curves. The urban model was less conclusive, which suggests that the method was not appropriate in the urban situation. The second analysis method involved comparing <b>bendiness</b> values of a site’s “immediate area” with those of its influence area. It was found that, although the spreads of the comparison sites’ distributions were smaller than those of the crash sites, the mean values were generally very similar and no appropriate <b>bendiness</b> ratios could be specified to reduce crash risk. Overall it appears that, if design consistency is maintained, <b>bendiness</b> is a protective quality for rural roads...|$|E
40|$|This paper summarises the {{findings}} of a comprehensive study of the effects of road network <b>bendiness</b> on traffic crashes that used GIS (geographical information system) analysis (Fowler 2007). The study was based on previous research that examined the effect of road network <b>bendiness</b> on crash occurrence at a TLA level of aggregation (Haynes et al. 2007 b). It was assumed that the <b>bendiness</b> measures used by Haynes et al (2007 b) would be more appropriate for predicting crash occurrence, and more useful from a traffic engineering viewpoint, when applied to localised regions. Thus a more appropriate method is presented and illustrated by a case study of New Zealand fatal traffic crashes. The crash data consisted of the 4019 fatal crashes that occurred on New Zealand roads in the period 1996 to 2006. Sample sets of randomly selected non-crash sites on the road network were also analysed for comparison. The <b>bendiness</b> measures analysed were: bend density (number of bends per km); detour ratio (ratio of actual distance travelled between junctions to straight line distance); cumulative angle (degrees per km); mean angle (degrees); and standard deviation of angles.

The <b>bendiness</b> measures analysed were: bend density (number of bends per km); detour ratio (ratio of actual distance travelled between junctions to straight line distance); cumulative angle (degrees per km); mean angle (degrees); and standard deviation of angles. These were applied to areas of influence extending to 1 km of travel around each site. Rural and urban environments were analysed separately as it was considered that the two cases would be significantly different. Many factors complicated attempts to apply the <b>bendiness</b> measures at crash locations. It was difficult to infer the effects of the road travelled on driver behaviour given that the routes taken leading up to crash locations were unknown. Sample sets of flow data were used in some regions to infer likely routes taken. The remaining data was simply weighted according to the number of alternative routes; this proved effective for situations with low variability of flow on surrounding roads. Binary logistic regression models were developed for both the rural and urban situations to predict the probability of a crash occurring on a section of road with certain <b>bendiness</b> characteristics. The urban model developed did not have a significant goodness-of-fit and so was not discussed further in this paper. It was found that rural roads with numerous but consistent bends were safer than completely straight roads or large individual curves, which indicates that <b>bendiness</b> is a protective quality as long as design consistency is maintained...|$|E
40|$|In this {{exploratory}} paper, {{we discuss}} quantitative graph-theoretical measures of network aesthetics. Related {{work in this}} area has typically focused on geometrical features (e. g., line crossings or edge <b>bendiness)</b> of drawings or visual representations of graphs which purportedly affect an observer’s perception. Here we take a very different approach, abandoning reliance on geometrical properties, and apply information-theoretic measures to abstract graphs and networks directly (rather than to their visual representaions) as a means of capturing classical appreciation of structural symmetry. Examples are used solely to motivate the approach to measurement, and to elucidate our symmetry-based mathematical theory of network aesthetics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This paper {{demonstrates}} {{a method for}} estimating the geographical accessibility of public hospitals. Using Geographical Information Systems, cost path analysis is {{used to determine the}} minimum travel time and distance to the closest hospital via a road network. This analysis is applied to approximately 36, 000 small areas in New Zealand allowing geographical access to be linked to local populations. Statistics can be generated on what is the total time spent traveling or the total distance traveled if everybody visited a hospital once. These statistics can be generated for different management areas and enables comparisons to be made between regions. This accessibility model is intended for decision support for planners assessing the distribution of hospital services. It can also be easily adapted for other services such as access to General Practitioners and cancer screening centers. A difficulty with calculating travel times is determining the travel speeds for different roads. Road layers often contain information that describes the road characteristics and additional information on the <b>bendiness</b> of the roads can be obtained from calculating the sinuosity of the roads. A process for calculating sinuosity and estimating road travel speeds is described. This study has shown that the northern and southern parts of New Zealand have high average travel times to hospital services. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a novel analysis of accident data on Ireland’s National Secondary Road network. This is a national network of single-carriageway A-roads. The results challenge the conventionally-held belief that a better-designed road is a safer road [...] Single-carriageway A-roads in rural areas are among the most dangerous routes on the network. Alongside journey time savings, safety improvements are therefore one of the main benefits claimed to result from quality improvements to rural single-carriageway roads. Existing appraisal methods support the engineers ’ natural conviction that a better-designed road is a safer road. However, this contrasts with anecdotal evidence that as speeds and traffic flows increase, so does the likelihood of a fatal accident. This paper examines the safety issue in more detail and presents a novel analysis of accident data on the National Secondary Road network in Ireland. The Irish national secondary network consists of 2, 700 km of single-carriageway A-roads, complementing the national primary routes. The context is similar to Scotland – the two countries face similar challenges of accessibility to peripheral rural areas. For this analysis, the 34 National Secondary routes have been broken up into 850 sections, each with a road quality score based on <b>bendiness,</b> carriageway width and gradient. Econometric analysis of accident rates and types by road quality identifies a number of interesting characteristics. As road quality improves, the overall accident rate falls. But the likelihood of a fatal accident increases, up to a certain threshold, before it begins to fall. This more accurate modelling of accident rates leads to a situation where road quality improvements can result in an increase in the economic cost of accidents, with major implications for cost-benefit analysis of rural road improvement schemes. © PTRC and Contributors 2010...|$|E
40|$|SWOV’s new {{research}} programme started in 2007. This research programme consists of ten sub-programmes, and Roads and Traffic {{is one of}} them. Research database is a project within this sub-programme. In this project, data needs to be acquired for study {{of the effects of}} road and traffic characteristics on road safety, which is the subject of the project Advancing Sustainable Safety – Layout (ASS – Layout). Knowledge of these effects is relevant for researchers, road authorities and policy makers. Although many road authorities maintain databases with road and traffic characteristics, there is no suitable research database in the Netherlands at this moment. Therefore, {{there is a need for}} a database with road and traffic data, which is specifically meant for road safety analyses and policy, and related applications. Internationally such databases already exist. The United States developed the Highway Safety Information System (HSIS) in the 1980 s. In this system, many crashes, road and traffic data are recorded for nine states and two urban centres. Every year, the data is updated. Another kind of database is MOLASSES in the United Kingdom. This database contains information on measures taken by local road authorities for local roads which are meant to address a road safety problem. MOLASSES has not been maintained for a number of years and is therefore not up-to-date anymore. The HSIS meets SWOV's demands of a research database quite well. The structure of the Dutch database Wegkenmerken+, with road characteristics and traffic volumes, strongly resembles the HSIS, but contains far fewer road characteristics and is not complete by far. That is the reason why Wegkenmerken+ has not yet been found suitable as basis for the desired research database. In the United States, a list has been drawn up of 180 road and traffic characteristics that are considered the minimum required for road safety research: the Model Minimum Inventory of Roadway Elements. SWOV aims at a database with a more limited number of road and traffic characteristics. The database should contain data on the quantity and composition of traffic. The desired road characteristics should describe the function (for example type of road and speed limit), the alignment (for example visibility, <b>bendiness</b> and hilliness) and the cross section (for example number of lanes, road width, shoulder layout). The database must also contain data on intersections, such as the type (roundabout, priority intersection et cetera), the number of legs and the presence of bicycle and/or pedestrian facilities. Unambiguous definitions and encodings should be drawn up for all characteristics. In the project ASS – Layout, SWOV intends to develop accident prediction models. In the project the choice was made not to include all sorts of road characteristics in the models as explanatory variables, but to set up models. for homogeneous groups of roads. Such a group should contain sufficient road sections to make reliable analyses. Therefore it is advisable that the database contains all roads in the Netherlands. This is very innovative, and therefore, initially, only accident prediction models are developed for rural distributor roads. These roads have already been inventoried for the provinces of Gelderland and Drenthe. This inventory can be considered a pilot study for the feasibility of the desired research database. In this pilot study, the road characteristics were collected manually, which is very labour-intensive. Therefore, direct data input into a GIS is recommended for following occasions. A possibility for collecting data is to request road authorities to hand over their databases and to merge them into one consistent unit. Furthermore, the usefulness of new developments, such as Google Earth, panoramic pictures of CycloMedia and micro-simulation models can also be taken into account. After data has been collected, it is important to perform quality checks. At this stage it should be checked if certain data are not inconsistent or that there are strange differences between road or traffic characteristics of adjacent road sections. When the database is updated on a yearly basis, it can be checked if there are unusual differences between two successive years...|$|E
