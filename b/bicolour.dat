5|$|According to the CBS document, the {{original}} Bhutanese flag was a <b>bicolour</b> square flag divided diagonally {{from the lower}} hoist to the upper fly. The field of yellow extended from the hoist to the upper fly, and the red field extended from the fly end to the lower hoist. In {{the centre of the}} flag, at the convergence of the yellow and red fields, is a green Druk, located parallel to the bottom edge and facing the fly.|$|E
5|$|The first {{calls for}} {{independence}} from the Spanish crown came on 10 August 1809; a plain red flag was flown by the rebels. The independence movement was defeated in November 1812 {{at the hands of}} Spanish officer Juan Sámano. On 9 October 1820, a new flag, a blue and white <b>bicolour,</b> with five horizontal alternating stripes, and three white stars in the middle stripe, was raised for the first time. The three stars represent Guayaquil, Portoviejo and Machala. This flag was later adopted by the Guayas Province.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. It was reconfirmed as the {{national flag}} when the republic gained independence on 9 August 1965. Prior to its independence, {{it was the only}} state flag in Malaysia not to have a 1:2 ratio. The design is a horizontal <b>bicolour</b> of red above white, overlaid in the canton (upper-left quadrant) by a white crescent moon facing a pentagon of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.|$|E

5000|$|All Šarplaninac {{are solid}} in colour: fawn, iron grey, white or almost black; usually sable or gray with darker [...] "overalls" [...] {{on the head}} and back, the {{undercoat}} being paler. The colour need not be completely uniform, and most Šarplaninac have several different shades of the same colour fading into one another. There are no <b>bicolours</b> and no uniformly black-coated dogs among purebreds, but odd-coloured specimens do exist. The dogs must not have large white patches in their coat.|$|R
5000|$|The Basset Hound is a short-legged {{breed of}} dog of the hound family, {{as well as}} one of six {{recognized}} Basset breeds in France. The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell for tracking is second only to that of the Bloodhound.The name Basset is derived from the French word bas, meaning [...] "low", with the attenuating suffix -et meaning [...] "small", together meaning [...] "rather low". Basset Hounds are usually <b>bicolours</b> or tricolours of standard hound colouration.|$|R

2500|$|While each {{county council}} has {{a coat of}} arms, there are no {{official}} county flags. [...] Flags with the GAA county colours serve as de facto county flags. [...] However, there are no standardised formats for these, except Kildare whose flag, like their kit, is all-white. Typically, flags are formed as vertical <b>bicolours</b> or tricolours. Usually, the major colour is nearer the hoist. Moreover, horizontal stripes are used by some individuals. (This is common in County Offaly, where vertical county colours might be mistaken for the flag of Ireland; however other Offaly fans deliberately exploit this double significance.) ...|$|R
50|$|Although {{there was}} a small {{breeding}} program stemming from the last of Pat Turner's cats being kept by Barbara Lambert (Nomis cattery, breeding under FIFe guidelines), this disappeared following her death in the early 2000s. The first modern-day Oriental <b>Bicolours</b> were imported to the UK starting in 2004 with the arrival of Black & White male Tassam Tom of Landican owned by Sarah Johnson and Pat Norman of the Landican Cattery. The variety gained official Preliminary recognition with the GCCF in 2006. In 2008 the breed progressed to Provisional Status, the fastest breed recognition within this organisation and a mark of the breed's popularity and success.|$|R
50|$|The French breeder Joseph Pernet-Ducher {{initiated}} {{the first class}} of roses to include genes from the old Austrian briar rose (Rosa foetida) with his 1900 introduction of 'Soleil d'Or.' This resulted in an entirely new colour range for roses: shades of deep yellow, apricot, copper, orange, true scarlet, yellow <b>bicolours,</b> lavender, gray, and even brown were now possible. Originally considered a separate class, the Pernetianas or Hybrid Foetidas were officially merged into the Hybrid Teas in 1930. The new colour range did much to increase hybrid tea popularity in the 20th century, but these colours came at a price: Rosa foetida also passed on a tendency toward disease-susceptibility, scentless blooms, and an intolerance of pruning to its descendants.|$|R

25|$|The {{flag of the}} European Coal and Steel Community was a {{horizontal}} <b>bicolour</b> flag defaced with stars which represented the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) between 1958 (six years after the ECSC was founded) until 2002 when the Community was merged into the European Union (EU). Prior to 1958 the ECSC {{did not have a}} flag, and no other flag has been used by a historical part of the European Union other than the flag of Europe.|$|E
25|$|Unique in {{sense of}} not fitting {{into any of}} the above categories. The {{parentage}} of Unique pelargoniums is confused and obscure. One theory being a derivation from P.fulgidum, but a derivation from an older cultivar 'Old Unique’, also known as or ‘Rollinson’s Crimson’, in the mid-19th century is also claimed. Unique pelargoniums resemble upright Scented Leaf pelargoniums in being shrubby and woody evergreens. They have distinctly scented leaves, and small flowers with blotched and feathered petals. They may have <b>bicolour</b> foliage. Some types, popularly known in the hobby as hybrid Uniques, have been crossed with Regal pelargoniums and, {{as a result of this}} cross, are much more floriferous.|$|E
500|$|The Flag of Portugal (...) is the {{national}} flag of the Portuguese Republic. It is a rectangular <b>bicolour</b> with a field unevenly divided into green on the hoist, and red on the fly. The lesser version of {{the national}} coat of arms (i.e. armillary sphere and Portuguese shield) is centered over the colour boundary {{at equal distance from}} the upper and lower edges. On 30 June 1911, {{less than a year after}} the downfall of the constitutional monarchy, this design was officially adopted for the new national flag of the First Portuguese Republic, after selection by a special commission whose members included Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro, João Chagas and Abel Botelho.|$|E

2500|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "ivy geraniums". [...] Usually of lax growth (trailing), mainly {{due to the}} long thin stems, with thick, waxy ivy-shaped stiff fleshy {{evergreen}} leaves developed by the species P.peltatum to retain moisture during periods of drought. Much used for hanging pots, tubs and basket cultivation. In the UK the bulbous double-headed types are preferred whilst on the European continent the balcon single types for large-scale hanging floral displays are favoured. Ivy-leaved pelargoniums embrace all such growth size types including small-leaved varieties and genetic hybrid crosses, which display little or no zonal characteristics. May have <b>bicolour</b> leaves and may have flowers that are single, double or rosette. Ivy pelargoniums are often sold as series such as 'Great Balls of Fire', {{in a variety of}} colours such as 'Great Balls of Fire Burgundy'.|$|E
2500|$|Angel pelargoniums {{are similar}} to Regal pelargoniums but more closely {{resemble}} P.crispum in leaf shape and growth habit. The majority of Angel cultivars originate from a cross between P.crispum and a Regal variety {{in the early part}} of the 20th century. Angels have grown in popularity in the last 30 years or so due mainly to an explosion of new varieties being released by specialist nurseries resulting from the work done by dedicated amateur hybridisers. These hybrisers have managed to obtain many new flower colour breaks and tighter growth habits resulting in plants suitable for all sorts of situations. Angels basically have the appearance of a small Regal with small serrated leaves and much smaller flowers and are more compact and bushy. The group extends to include similar small-leaved and -flowered types but usually with P.crispum in their parentage. They are mostly upright bush-type plants but there are some lax varieties that can be used for basket or hanging pot cultivation. Often called [...] "pansy-faced" [...] in the US. Some varieties have <b>bicolour</b> foliage. Other terms include ‘Langley-Smith Hybrids’.|$|E
50|$|During the 1980s European breeders, principally {{those in}} France and the Netherlands, {{initiated}} their own Oriental <b>Bicolour</b> breeding lines. A {{red and white}} female Moroccan street cat {{was used as an}} initial outcross, then later on a Black & White Cornish Rex. Further cats were imported from the USA. It was important for breeders to have different lines {{in order to be able}} to mate <b>bicolour</b> to <b>bicolour</b> and obtain a higher proportion of white on the coat, without excessive inbreeding.|$|E
50|$|Although some {{experimental}} breeding {{took place}} during the 1970s and 1980s in the UK, including Pat Turner's Seychellois breeding program, the modern-day Oriental <b>Bicolour</b> owes its origins to matings initiated in the USA by Lindajean Grillo (Ciara Cattery). Starting in 1979, Grillo carried out a series of matings between Siamese and <b>Bicolour</b> American Shorthair. She then selected the best <b>Bicolour</b> offspring to mate back to Siamese or Orientals in order to regain type. The variety was granted recognition by TICA in 1983 and the first champion was Ciara Quite-N-Oreo.|$|E

50|$|There are {{differences}} {{in the way that}} Oriental Bicolours are registered in different organisations. Some will register <b>Bicolour</b> Oriental Shorthairs and <b>Bicolour</b> Siamese/Seychellois separately, maintaining a genetic segregation between long and short coats and colourpoint and solid patterns. This effectively fragments different groups of Oriental <b>Bicolour.</b> The GCCF registration policy for the breed allows for all the groups to be bred together so that cats carrying the genes for long hair of colourpoint are not considered variants. Permitted outcrosses are Siamese, Balinese, Oriental Shorthair and Oriental Longhair. All offspring are registered as Oriental Bicolours and cannot be registered under the breed of their outcross parent. Offspring who do not inherit white spotting can now be registered as Orientals according to their phenotype and can be shown.|$|E
