5|$|Lawsuits pending (House v. Price) such {{as whether}} cost-sharing {{subsidies}} must be paid. President Trump threatened not to pay these subsidies in early 2017 and later decided to stop paying them. CBO estimated in September 2017 that discontinuing the payments would add an average of 15-20 percentage points to health insurance costs on the exchanges in 2018 while increasing the budget deficit nearly $200 <b>billion</b> <b>over</b> a decade.|$|E
5|$|The CBO in June 2015 {{forecasted}} that {{repeal of}} ACA {{would increase the}} deficit between $137 billion and $353 <b>billion</b> <b>over</b> the 2016–2025 period, depending {{on the impact of}} macroeconomic feedback effects. The CBO also forecasted that repeal of ACA would likely cause an increase in GDP by an average of 0.7% in the period from 2021 to 2015, mainly by boosting the supply of labor.|$|E

5|$|Sound Transit {{suspended}} {{planning for}} the Portage Bay tunnel in 2000 after it received construction bids that were $171 million higher than expected and found, through soil testing, that a deeper tunnel would be required. The project's costs overall rose $1 <b>billion</b> <b>over</b> budget and the schedule was delayed by three years, due to unrealistic cost and time estimates made during previous stages of planning. Capitol Hill businesses, while initially supportive of the light rail station's placement, later pulled their support of the cut and cover option due to the longer period required for construction. Sound Transit, faced with budget issues and further schedule delays, deferred construction of the segment between Downtown Seattle and the University District in 2001 while re-evaluating alignment options.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} {{launched}} {{as part of}} the Soviet Union's manned spaceflight programme effort to maintain a long-term research outpost in space, and following the collapse of the USSR, was operated by the new Russian Federal Space Agency (RKA). As a result, most of the station's occupants were Soviet; through international collaborations such as the Intercosmos, Euromir and Shuttle–Mir programmes, the station was made accessible to space travelers from several Asian, European and North American nations. Mir was deorbited in March 2001 after funding was cut off. The cost of the Mir programme was estimated by former RKA General Director Yuri Koptev in 2001 as $4.2 <b>billion</b> <b>over</b> its lifetime (including development, assembly and orbital operation).|$|E
5|$|Nuclear {{power and}} fossil fuels are subsidized by many governments, and wind power {{and other forms}} of {{renewable}} energy are also often subsidized. For example, a 2009 study by the Environmental Law Institute assessed the size and structure of U.S. energy subsidies over the 2002–2008 period. The study estimated that subsidies to fossil-fuel based sources amounted to approximately $72 <b>billion</b> <b>over</b> this period and subsidies to renewable fuel sources totalled $29 billion. In the United States, the federal government has paid US$74billion for energy subsidies to support R for nuclear power ($50 billion) and fossil fuels ($24 billion) from 1973 to 2003. During this same time frame, renewable energy technologies and energy efficiency received a total of US$26billion. It has been suggested that a subsidy shift would help {{to level the playing field}} and support growing energy sectors, namely solar power, wind power, and biofuels. History shows that no energy sector was developed without subsidies.|$|E

5|$|Ryan's budget plans {{proposed}} privatizing Medicare {{for those}} {{under the age}} of 55, and funding Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program through block grants to the states. In 2012 Ryan proposed that Medicaid be converted into block grants, but with the federal government's share of the cost cut by some $800 <b>billion</b> <b>over</b> the next decade. Currently, Medicaid is administered by the states, subject to federal rules concerning eligibility, and the amount paid by the federal government depends on {{the number of people who}} qualify. His plan would have undone a Reagan-era reform by which the federal government prohibited the states from requiring that a patient's spouse, as well as the patient, deplete all of his or her assets before Medicaid would cover long-term care. Ryan’s budget plan proposed raising the Medicare eligibility age, beginning in 2023, by two months a year, until it reached 67 in 2034. A 2011 analysis, conducted by the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research group, for the Kaiser Family Foundation, estimated that Ryan's 2011 plan would have resulted in 14 million to 27 million fewer people receiving Medicaid coverage by 2021.|$|E
