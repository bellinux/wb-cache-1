Professor Sang Yup Lee at the Department of Chemical and <b>Biomolecular</b> <b>Engineering,</b> KAIST, Dr. Do Young Seung at GS Caltex, a large oil refining company in Korea, and Dr. Yu-Sin Jang at BioFuelChem, a startup butanol company in Korea, applied a systems metabolic engineering approach to improve the production of butanol through enhancing the performance of Clostridium acetobutylicum, {{one of the best}} known butanol-producing bacteria. In addition, the downstream process was optimized and an in situ recovery process was integrated to achieve higher butanol titer, yield, and productivity.

40|$|<b>Biomolecular</b> circuit <b>engineering</b> is {{critical}} for implementing complex functions in vivo, and is a baseline method in the synthetic biology space. However, current methods for conducting <b>biomolecular</b> circuit <b>engineering</b> are time-consuming and tedious. A complete design-build-test cycle typically takes weeks' to months' time {{due to the lack}} of an intermediary between design ex vivo and testing in vivo. In this work, we explore the development and application of a "biomolecular breadboard" composed of an in-vitro transcription-translation (TX-TL) lysate to rapidly speed up the engineering design-build-test cycle. We first developed protocols for creating and using lysates for conducting biological circuit design. By doing so we simplified the existing technology to an affordable ($ 0. 03 /uL) and easy to use three-tube reagent system. We then developed tools to accelerate circuit design by allowing for linear DNA use in lieu of plasmid DNA, and by utilizing principles of modular assembly. This allowed the design-build-test cycle to be reduced to under a business day. We then characterized protein degradation dynamics in the breadboard to aid to implementing complex circuits. Finally, we demonstrated that the breadboard could be applied to engineer complex synthetic circuits in vitro and in vivo. Specifically, we utilized our understanding of linear DNA prototyping, modular assembly, and protein degradation dynamics to characterize the repressilator oscillator and to prototype novel three- and five-node negative feedback oscillators both in vitro and in vivo. We therefore believe the biomolecular breadboard has wide application for acting as an intermediary for biological circuit engineering...|$|R

40|$|Abstract The paper {{presents}} {{results of}} physico-chemical and biological investigations of a surface-engineered syn-thetic bone filler.

Cell cultures tests show that, in agreement with literature reports, surface-immobilized collagen molecular cues can stimulate progression along the osteogenic pathway of undifferentiated human mes-enchymal cells. Finally, in vivo test in a rabbit model of critical bone defects shows statistically significant increase of bone volume and mineral apposition rate between the biomimetic bone filler and collagen-free control. All to-gether, obtained data confirm that <b>biomolecular</b> surface <b>engineering</b> can upgrade the properties of implant device, by promoting more specific and targeted implant-host cells interactions. ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryFosfomycin is a {{clinically}} utilized, {{highly effective}} antibiotic, which is active against methicillin- and vancomycin-resistant pathogens. Here we report the cloning and characterization {{of a complete}} fosfomycin biosynthetic cluster from Streptomyces fradiae and heterologous production of fosfomycin in S. lividans. Sequence analysis coupled with gene deletion and disruption revealed that the minimal cluster consists of fom 1 - 4, fomA-D. A LuxR-type activator that was apparently required for heterologous fosfomycin production was also discovered ∼ 13 kb away from the cluster and was named fomR. The genes fomE and fomF, previously thought {{to be involved in}} fosfomycin biosynthesis, were shown not to be essential by gene disruption. This work provides new insights into fosfomycin biosynthesis and opens the door for fosfomycin overproduction and creation of new analogs via <b>biomolecular</b> pathway <b>engineering...</b>|$|R

40|$|From ligand–receptor binding to DNA hybridization, {{molecular}} recognition plays {{a central role}} in biology. Over the past several decades, chemists have successfully reproduced the exquisite specificity of <b>biomolecular</b> interactions. However, <b>engineering</b> multiple specific interactions in synthetic systems remains difficult. DNA retains its position as the best medium with which to create orthogonal, isoenergetic interactions, based on the complementarity of Watson–Crick binding. Here we show that DNA can be used to create diverse bonds using an entirely different principle: the geometric arrangement of blunt-end stacking interactions. We show that both binary codes and shape complementarity can serve as a basis for such stacking bonds, and explore their specificity, thermodynamics and binding rules. Orthogonal stacking bonds were used to connect five distinct DNA origami.

Additionally, a single pretreatment dose of erythrocyte-binding asparaginase tolerized mice to multiple subsequent doses of the wild-type enzyme.

40|$|Expanding the {{capabilities}} of ultrasound for biological and diagnostic imaging requires the development of contrast agents linked to cellular and molecular processes in vivo. In optical imaging this is commonly accomplished using fluorescent biomolecules such as the green fluorescent protein. Analogously, we recently introduced gas vesicles (GVs) as the first acoustic biomolecules for ultrasound. GVs are physically stable gas-filled protein nanostructures (~ 250 nm) naturally expressed in aquatic photosynthetic microbes {{as a means to}} regulate buoyancy. Purified GVs produce robust ultrasound contrast across a range of frequencies at picomolar concentrations, exhibit nonlinear scattering to enable enhanced detection versus background in vivo, and have species-dependent thresholds for pressure-induced collapse to enable multiplexed imaging. Here, I will present our recent progress on understanding the biophysical and acoustic properties of these <b>biomolecular</b> contrast agents, <b>engineering</b> their mechanics and targeting at the genetic level, developing ultrasound pulse sequences to enhance their detection in vivo and expressing them heterologously as acoustic reporter genes. 1.
