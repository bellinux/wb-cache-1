25|$|Given a {{structured}} object X of any sort, a symmetry is a mapping {{of the object}} onto itself which preserves the structure. This occurs in many cases; for example, if X is a set with no additional structure, a symmetry is a <b>bijective</b> <b>map</b> from the set to itself, giving rise to permutation groups. If the object X {{is a set of}} points in the plane with its metric structure or any other metric space, a symmetry is a bijection of the set to itself which preserves the distance between each pair of points (an isometry).|$|E

A bijective (not necessarily linear) map ϕ:L→L preserves solvability {{in both directions}} if both ϕ and ϕ− 1 map every solvable Lie subalgebra of L into some solvable Lie subalgebra. If n⩾ 3 then every such map is either a composition of a <b>bijective</b> lattice preserving <b>map</b> with a similarity transformation and a map [aij]↦[f(aij) ] induced by a field automorphism f:C→C, or a map of this type composed with the transposition. We also describe the general form of such maps in the case when n= 2. Using Lie's theorem we will reduce the proof of this statement {{to the problem of}} characterizing <b>bijective</b> <b>maps</b> on Mn preserving triangularizability of matrix pairs in both directions. As a byproduct we will characterize <b>bijective</b> <b>maps</b> on Mn that preserve inclusion for lattices of invariant subspaces in both directions...|$|R
