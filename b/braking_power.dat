40|$|The {{quest for}} biofuel {{production}} and use in Botswana {{is driven by}} factors including volatile oil prices, need for fuel security, potential for job creation, potential reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and economic diversification. In line with national efforts {{to come up with}} energy sources that are both environmentally friendly and sustainable, this work was carried out to compare performance properties of native crude marula (Sclerocarya birrea) seed oil and petrodiesel fuel on a variable compression engine test rig with automatic data acquisition set up. Parameters such as engine torque, <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and specific fuel consumption were measured at different loads for the two fuels. The results indicate that engine performance when powered with crude marula oil compares favourable with those for petrodiesel. Optimum numerical values for engine torque, <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and specific fuel consumption were 28. 2 Nm, 6. 27 W and 0. 34 g/kWh respectively for petrodiesel, and 22. 7 Nm, 6. 6 W, 0. 33 g/kWh respectively for crude marula oil. The engine performance was also analysed for same parameters, namely, engine torque, <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and specific fuel consumption when powered using the same fuels over a range of compression ratios while the load was fixed at 80 %. Optimum numerical values for engine torque, <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and specific fuel consumption were 27. 2 Nm, 3. 67 W and 0. 59 g/kWh respectively for petrodiesel, and 26. 3 Nm, 3. 6 W, 0. 34 g/kWh respectively for crude marula oil. The results indicate that compression ratio of 16 : 1 yields optimum engine performance in terms of engine torque and <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> for both fuels under review. However, marula oil fuel recorded smooth steady increase in performance profile across all compression ratios which out-performs petrodiesel on lower compression ratios for engine torque and <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> and is largely better than petrodiesel on fuel consumption...|$|R
5|$|World War II was a {{demanding}} {{time for the}} railway line, as the track was in heavy use for both civilian and military transportation, {{and much of the}} equipment and maintenance was lacking. On 28 February 1944 a descending eastbound freight train loaded with oil and petrol lost its <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> and became a runaway train, finally ploughing into a westbound passenger train at Breifoss, just east of Geilo. The crash and subsequent fire killed 25 civilians and an unknown number of German soldiers. Poor lubrication oil combined with the cold weather is believed to have caused the accident.|$|E

25|$|Technical {{improvements}} in the chassis include Tokico radial brake calipers, allowing smaller discs and therefore lower unsprung weight, translating into superior handling. Increased front <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> necessitated a sturdier lower triple clamp. The rear brake caliper {{was moved to the}} top of the disc, giving a cleaner visual appearance. New 17inch wheels were designed, using Bridgestone BT-015 radials taken almost directly from the GSX-R1000.|$|E
30|$|As for the O 2 {{concentration}} in the exhaust of each fuel, {{it is in a}} negative correlation to CO 2, NOx, torque, and <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> which indicates that the correlation between the break power of a diesel engine and O 2 concentration is high. The CO 2 {{concentration in}} exhaust was in a positive correlation to NOx, <b>brake</b> <b>power,</b> and torque. This is because the consumption of O 2 generated CO 2 and NOx and the energy conversion resulted in the corresponding <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> and torque. In addition, the NOx concentration in exhaust was a sum of substances such as NO and NO 2, and thus it was in a “positive” correlation to the CO 2 concentration. In this experiment, no correlation was found between the control variable engine speed (rpm) and other variables.|$|R

25|$|On any {{bike with}} only rear wheel braking, the maximum {{deceleration}} is {{significantly lower than}} on a bike equipped with a front brake. As a vehicle brakes, weight can be transferred towards the front wheel {{and away from the}} rear, decreasing the amount of grip the rear wheel has. Transferring the rider's weight back increases rear wheel braking efficiency, but a front wheel fitted with an ordinary brake might provide 70% or more of the <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> when braking hard.|$|E
25|$|The ABS {{controller}} {{knows that}} such a rapid deceleration is impossible, so it reduces the pressure to that brake until it sees an acceleration, then it increases the pressure until it sees the deceleration again. It can do this very quickly, before the tire can actually significantly change speed. The {{result is that the}} tire slows down {{at the same rate as}} the car, with the brakes keeping the tires very near the point at which they will start to lock up. This gives the system maximum <b>braking</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
25|$|Safety {{features}} on the ES 350 included dual front airbags, knee airbags, side-torso and curtain airbags, along with traction control, Vehicle Stability Control (VSC), anti-lock brakes (ABS), and electronic brake-force distribution (EBD). A pre-collision system (PCS), which incorporates a grille-mounted sensor and retracts seatbelts and triggers full <b>braking</b> <b>power,</b> was optional, and came with the distance-aware Dynamic Radar Cruise Control system. The front passenger airbag used a twin-chamber design for reduced occupant discomfort upon deployment. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) crash test results in 2007 rated the ES 350 the maximum five stars in the Frontal Driver, Frontal Passenger, and Side Driver categories, and four stars in the Side Rear Passenger and Rollover categories.|$|E

The producer gas was made from dry wood by the gasification process. The producer gas was used as a fuel for the engine. To study the effect of compression ratio and percentage of opened air inlet valve on break power, the compression ratio of 7. 5 : 1 and 9. 3 : 1 and percentage of opened air inlet valve of 30 % and 75 % were used. It was found that the <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> of compression ratio at 9. 3 : 1 with 75 % of opened air inlet valve was 1, 443. 6 Watts at 3, 800 rpm showed the highest break engine power because the high compression ratio was high, and the <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> was also high as the basic theory of an ideal Otto cycle...|$|R

Similarly the value for brake torque for fossil diesel was 44. 1 Nm and that of biodiesel was 45. 42 Nm. The average value obtained for the specific fuel consumption in the three experiments conducted for fossil diesel and biodiesel were 69. 09 and 129. 21 l/kWh respectively.

25|$|The discs are {{commonly}} made from cast iron {{and a certain}} amount of surface rust is normal. The disc contact area for the brake pads will be kept clean by regular use, but a vehicle that is stored for an extended period can develop significant rust in the contact area that may reduce <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> for a time until the rusted layer is worn off again. Rusting can also lead to disc warping when brakes are re-activated after storage because of differential heating between unrusted areas left covered by pads and rust around the majority of the disc area surface. Over time, vented brake discs may develop severe rust corrosion inside the ventilation slots, compromising the strength of the structure and needing replacement.|$|E
25|$|Scarring (US: Scoring) {{can occur}} if brake pads are not changed {{promptly}} {{when they reach}} the end of their service life and are considered worn out. Once enough of the friction material has worn away, the pad's steel backing plate (for glued pads) or the pad retainer rivets (for riveted pads) will bear directly upon the disc's wear surface, reducing <b>braking</b> <b>power</b> and making scratches on the disc. Generally a moderately scarred / scored disc, which operated satisfactorily with existing brake pads, will be equally usable with new pads. If the scarring is deeper but not excessive, it can be repaired by machining off a layer of the disc's surface. This can only be done a limited number of times as the disc has a minimum rated safe thickness. The minimum thickness value is typically cast into the disc during manufacturing on the hub or the edge of the disc. In Pennsylvania, which {{has one of the most}} rigorous auto safety inspection programs in North America, an automotive disc cannot pass safety inspection if any scoring is deeper than , and must be replaced if machining will reduce the disc below its minimum safe thickness.|$|E

40|$|The {{replacement}} of diesel fuel by ultra-carbofluids was perceived {{to offer the}} potential to decrease the emissions of environmental pollutants such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons (HC's) and smoke. Such ultracarbofluids consist of a suspension of coal in fuel oil and water generally in the ratio of 5 : 3 : 2 plus {{a small amount of}} stabilising additive. The literature relating to the economies of coal and fuel oil production, and the production and properties of charcoal and vegetable oils has been critically reviewed. The potential use of charcoal and vegetable oils as replacements for coal and fuel oil are discussed. An experimental investigation was undertaken using novel bio-ultracarbofluid formulations. These differed from an ultracarbofluid by having bio-renewable charcoal and vegetable oil in place of coal and fuel oil. Tests were made with a Lister-Petter 600 cc 2 -cylinder, 4 -stroke diesel engine fitted with a Heenan-Froude DPX 1 water brake dynamometer to measure <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> output, and Mexa- 321 E and Mexa- 211 E analysers to measure exhaust pollutants. Measurements were made of engine <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> output, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hydrocarbons and smoke emissions over the speed range 1000 to 3000 rpm at 200 rpm intervals. The results were compared with those obtained with a standard diesel reference fuel. All the bio-ultracarbofluid formulations produced lower <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> outputs (i. e. 5. 6 % to 20. 7 % less <b>brake</b> <b>power)</b> but substantially improved exhaust emissions of CO 2, CO, HC's and smoke. The major factor in the formulation was found to be the type and amount of charcoal; charcoal with a high volatile content (27. 2 %) and present at 30 % by mass yielded the best results, i. e. only slightly lower <b>brake</b> <b>power</b> output and significantly lower exhaust pollutants...|$|R
