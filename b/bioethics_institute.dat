40|$|Abstract The {{number of}} {{children}} in the US taking prescription drugs for emotional and behavioral disturbances is growing dramatically. This growth in the use of psychotropic drugs in pediatric populations has given rise to multiple controversies, ranging from concerns over off-label use and long-term safety to debates about the societal value and cultural meaning of pharmacological treatment of childhood behavioral and emotional disorders. This commentary summarizes the authors' eight main findings from the first of five workshops that seek to understand and produce descriptions of these controversies.

50|$|Bioethicists {{come from}} a wide variety of {{backgrounds}} and have training in a diverse array of disciplines. The field contains individuals trained in philosophy such as H. Tristram Engelhardt, Jr. of Rice University, Baruch Brody of Rice University, Peter Singer of Princeton University, Daniel Callahan of the Hastings Center, and Daniel Brock of Harvard University, medically trained clinician ethicists such as Mark Siegler of the University of Chicago and Joseph Fins of Cornell University, lawyers such as Nancy Dubler of Albert Einstein College of Medicine or Jerry Menikoff of the federal Office of Human Research Protections, political scientists like Francis Fukuyama, religious studies scholars including James Childress, public intellectuals like Amitai Etzioni of The George Washington University, and theologians like Lisa Sowle Cahill and Stanley Hauerwas. The field, once dominated by formally trained philosophers, has become increasingly interdisciplinary, with some critics even claiming that the methods of analytic philosophy have had a negative effect on the field's development. Leading journals in the field include The Journal of Medicine and Philosophy, The Hastings Center Report, the American Journal of Bioethics, the Journal of Medical Ethics, <b>Bioethics,</b> the Kennedy <b>Institute</b> of Ethics Journal and the Cambridge Quarterly of Healthcare Ethics. Bioethics has also benefited from the process philosophy developed by Alfred North Whitehead.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The Hastings Center, a <b>bioethics</b> {{research}} <b>institute,</b> {{is holding}} a series of 5 workshops to examine the controversies surrounding the use of medication to treat emotional and behavioral disturbances in children. These workshops bring together clinicians, researchers, scholars, and advocates with diverse perspectives and from diverse fields. Our first commentary in CAPMH, which grew out of our first workshop, explained our method and explored the controversies in general. This commentary, which grows out of our second workshop, explains why informed people can disagree about ADHD diagnosis and treatment. Based on what workshop participants said and {{our understanding of the}} literature, we make 8 points. (1) The ADHD label is based on the interpretation of a heterogeneous set of symptoms that cause impairment. (2) Because symptoms and impairments are dimensional, there is an inevitable "zone of ambiguity," which reasonable people will interpret differently. (3) Many other variables, from different systems and tools of diagnosis to different parenting styles and expectations, also help explain why behaviors associated with ADHD can be interpreted differently. (4) Because people hold competing views about the proper goals of psychiatry and parenting, some people will be more, and others less, concerned about treating children in the zone of ambiguity. (5) To recognize that nature has written no bright line between impaired and unimpaired children, and that {{it is the responsibility of}} humans to choose who should receive a diagnosis, does not diminish the significance of ADHD. (6) Once ADHD is diagnosed, the facts surrounding the most effective treatment are complicated and incomplete; contrary to some popular wisdom, behavioral treatments, alone or in combination with low doses of medication, can be effective in the long-term reduction of core ADHD symptoms and at improving many aspects of overall functioning. (7) Especially when a child occupies the zone of ambiguity, different people will emphasize different values embedded in the pharmacological and behavioral approaches. (8) Truly informed decision-making requires that parents (and to the extent they are able, children) have some sense of the complicated and incomplete facts regarding the diagnosis and treatment of ADHD. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Started {{a one-year}} diploma program in {{bioethics}} for healthcare related professionals in 2006. The broad {{objective of this}} program is to develop human resource {{in the field of}} bioethics in Pakistan to promote ethics teaching. Objective: To perform an outcome based evaluation of CBEC’s bioethics diploma program for achievement of the program objectives. Methods: Outcome logic model was applied through a questionnaire based approach. Data for direct output was retrieved from CBEC electronic databank and faculty. A mix of close-ended and open-ended questions were asked from the graduates of CBEC from 2006 to 2010. The quantitative feedback was analyzed for frequencies and percentages. Content analysis was conducted for the open-ended responses. Results: Four batches have graduated from the inception of the program till the time of evaluation. A total of 50 students were enrolled, while 41 graduated during this period. Ten of the graduates have completed their Master degree in <b>bioethics</b> from different <b>Institutes.</b> Sixteen are involved in institutional ethics committee either as chair, secretary or members. The study questionnaire was filled by 31 (76 %) of the 41 graduated students. All respondents believe the diploma has increased their knowledge of ethics and they are involved in disseminating the acquired knowledge through presentations (100 %), seminars/ conferences (93 %), ethics related teaching and awareness activities (70 %). Significant number of respondents believe their behavior towards the profession has changed after the diploma (90 %) and {{they have been able to}} improve the quality of work environment (87 %). More than half of the respondents have published ethics related articles after their diploma (58 %). The quantitative data revealed a tangible positive impact of the program on the respondents’ professional and personal lives. Conclusion: The outcomes and interpretation of data have shown that the program has achieved its objective during the first five years of inception...|$|R
