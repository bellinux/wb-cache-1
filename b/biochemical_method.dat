Immunoprecipitation of the RBP of interest is followed by isolation of the crosslinked and coimmunoprecipitated RNA.

30|$|The lactose {{levels in}} 20 breast milk samples were quantitated by the {{plasmonic}} MS and {{compared to the}} conventional <b>biochemical</b> <b>method</b> (Fig.  3 c, Table S 3). The isotopic quantification afforded an average recovery of 105.3 % and a coefficient of variation (CV) of 6.2 %, which was comparable to the enzymatic kit that afforded an average recovery of 105.0 % and a CV of 3.6 % (Fig. S 9). These two approaches showed reasonable consistency as per the linear fit method, with an R 2 of 0.77 (Fig.  3 d). The <b>biochemical</b> <b>method</b> is the current gold standard in use, relying on the reaction between analytes and enzymes for colorimetric detection to quantitate small molecules [48]. More specifically, the <b>biochemical</b> <b>method</b> is indirect in nature, detecting galactose based on the hydrolysis of lactose into galactose and glucose by β-galactosidase. In contrast, the plasmonic MS method directly detects lactose. Notably, plasmonic MS can be advantageous in terms of speed (reaction free, in minute overall analysis) and sensitivity (~[*] 6  nL of sample required), compared to the <b>biochemical</b> <b>method</b> that requires several hours for analysis (including bio-reactions and pre-treatment steps) and utilizes milliliters of sample.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the antidepressant activity of Medhovikas and its activity is compared with that of Imipramine and Mentat. The MAO-A and MAO-B levels were estimated by the <b>Biochemical</b> <b>Method.</b> Methods: There are several methods available to evaluate the antidepressant activity. In the present study the antidepressant activity is assessed using behavioural despair method such as Forced swim test (FST) in mice. Imipramine is used as a positive control in doses of 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, Similar activity was also observed with Medhovikas in doses of 200 and 400 mg/kg. <b>Biochemical</b> <b>method</b> in rats to estimate the levels of MAO-A and MAO-B, the biogenic amine 5 -HT is oxidized by MAO to 5 -hydrixy indole acetic acid (5 -HIAA) as a major metabolite and is excreted in urine. Hence the reduction in the urinary 5 -HIAA level from normal after treatment with the test compound was taken as a measure of it’s MAO inhibitory action. Results: The antidepressant activity of 200 and 400 mg/kg of Medhovikas was equivalent to that of 10 and 20 mg/kg of imipramine respectively. It significantly reduced the duration of immobility indicating antidepressant activity. Significant decrease in brain MAO-A and MAO-B levels were observed which was determined by the <b>Biochemical</b> <b>method.</b> Conclusion: Antidepressant activity was probably shown by inhibiting MAO-A and MAO-B, There are several methods to detect the monoamine oxidaise inhibitor activity of substances.

DESIGN: Mycobacterially positive BACTEC cultures were collected and MTC in the cultures was identified using <b>biochemical</b> <b>methods.</b> MTC was identified using serpentine cording in smears, the Capilia TB assay or the BD ProbeTec ET (CTB) system, and the results were compared. RESULTS: Using 23 3 mycobacterially positive BACTEC cultures, the sensitivity and specificity of identification of the Capilia TB assay were respectively 96. 9 % and 98. 6 %, while those of the BD ProbeTec ET (CTB) system were respectively 99. 4 % and 97. 3 %. Combining the Capilia TB assay with serpentine cording in smears led to 100 % specificity for intersected results and 100 % sensitivity for combined results.
