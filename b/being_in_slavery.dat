2500|$|There {{have been}} {{movements}} to achieve reparations for those formerly held as slaves, or sometimes their descendants. Claims for reparations for <b>being</b> held <b>in</b> <b>slavery</b> are handled {{as a civil}} law matter in almost every country. This is often decried as a serious problem, since former slaves' relative lack of money means they often have limited access to a potentially expensive and futile legal process.

5000|$|Many {{slaves were}} transported to Delta towns by riverboat from slave markets in New Orleans, {{which became the}} fourth largest {{city in the country}} by 1840. Other slaves were transported downriver from slave markets at Memphis and Louisville. Still others were transported by sea in the {{coastwise}} slave trade. By this time, slavery had long been established as a racial caste. African Americans for generations worked the commodity plantations, which they made extremely profitable. In the opinion of Jefferson Davis and others later living <b>in</b> Mississippi, Africans <b>being</b> held <b>in</b> <b>slavery</b> reflected the will of Providence, as it led to their Christianizing and to the improvement of their condition, compared to what it would have been had they remained in Africa. [...] According to Davis, the Africans [...] "increased from a few unprofitable savages to millions of efficient Christian laborers." ...|$|R

2500|$|In March 1822, Mehmed Emin secured decisive {{victories}} at Kolindros and Kastania. Further north, in {{the vicinity}} of Naousa, Zafeirakis Theodosiou, Karatasos and Gatsos organized the city's defense, and the first clashes resulted in a victory for the Greeks. Mehmed Emin then appeared before the town with 10,000 regular troops and 10,600 irregulars. Failing to get the insurgents to surrender, Mehmed Emin launched a number of attacks pushing them further back and finally captured Naousa in April, helped by the enemies of Zafeirakis, who had revealed an unguarded spot, the [...] "Alonia". Reprisals and executions ensued, and women are reported to have flung themselves over the Arapitsa waterfall to avoid dishonor and <b>being</b> sold <b>in</b> <b>slavery.</b> Those who broke through the siege of Naousa fell back in Kozani, Siatista and Aspropotamos River, or were carried by the Psarian fleet to the northern Aegean islands.|$|R
40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this paper to show how the taking of British West Indians into <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> Cuba and the {{repression}} of a supposed uprising were closely connected. The Escalera, while not directly caused by the presence of these black British subjects, was nevertheless partly the result of interrelated events that began with the importation of the latter into Cuba by white British planters escaping the abolition of slavery and the slave-trade in the British colonies. With Cuba still firmly a slave society, they were maintained in bondage, along with other black British West Indians who were kidnapped from their home islands by unscrupulous traders, and sold to Cuban planters hungry for labourers. Despite the presence in Havana of a Mixed Commission for the Suppression of the Slave Trade, charged with ensuring that such breaches of the anti-slave-trade treaties did not go unchallenged, many British representatives in Cuba were themselves implicated in the continuance of slavery, until the appointment in 1840 of the militant abolitionist David Turnbull as British Consul and Superintendent of Liberated Africans. Turnbull forcefully investigated and sought freedom for all those black British subjects who were <b>being</b> held <b>in</b> <b>slavery</b> <b>in</b> the island. While the Spanish accusations made against him of conspiring for revolution were probably false, his actions (combined with the presence in the island of other abolition-minded British migrants, as well as that of the enslaved black British subjects themselves) had a destabilizing effect upon the Cuban slave system, acting as a catalyst for the unsuccessful uprising of 1843 / 44, and the subsequent brutal repression...|$|R
40|$|The {{central issue}} of the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment was {{property}}: property {{in the body and}} intellectual property. Once removed from the body, tissue and body fluids were not legally the property of the Tuskegee subjects. Consequently, there was not a direct relationship between a patient and research that used his sera. The Public Health Service (PHS) was free to exercise its property right in Tuskegee sera to develop serologic tests for syphilis with commercial potential. To camouflage the true meaning, the PHS made a distinction between direct clinical studies and indirect studies of tissue and body fluids. This deception caused all reviews to date to limit their examination to documents labeled by the PHS as directly related to the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment. This excluded other information in the public domain. Despite the absence of a clinical protocol, this subterfuge led each to falsely conclude that the Tuskagee Syphilis Experiment was a clinical study. Based on publications of indirect research using sera and cerebrospinal fluid, this article conceives a very history of the Tuskagee Syphilis Experiment. Syphilis could only cultivate <b>in</b> living <b>beings.</b> As <b>in</b> <b>slavery,</b> the generative ability of the body made the Tuskegee subjects real property and gave untreated syphilis and the sera of the Tuskegee subjects immense commercial value. Published protocols exploited the Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment to invent and commercialize biotechnology for the applied science of syphilis serology...|$|R
