40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to get {{knowledge}} of the communicationprocess between the <b>branch</b> <b>head</b> and the co-worker in communal geriatric care. To narrow it down we focused on how the <b>branch</b> <b>head</b> experience the communicationprocess in conflictsituations between co-workers and what she or he usually do to resolve the conflict. We made qualitative interviews with ten of the <b>branch</b> <b>heads</b> in communal geriatric care, in four communes. The questions we had in mind throughout the study was based on four keywords (communication, leadership, conflict and conflict management) of which we created a narrative story from every interviewing person to get hold of the experience and knowledge behind their interviews. In our analysis as theoretical perspectives we used system theory, communication theory, attribution theory and the philosophy of Dialogue by Martin Buber. Our result show that the communication between both co-workers and the <b>branch</b> <b>head</b> is the most important tool for conflict management. Here lies a well functioning dialogue where the co-workers get the chance to question, be heard and mark their limit. Based on the interviews we saw that no matter how the <b>branch</b> <b>head</b> treat and lead the co-workers, conflict will rise. However, there are a few things pointed out as important to ease the effect on conflict and that is to communicate with straight and forward messages, inform the co-workers what goal the organization has and strive after a mutual relationship between everyone in the organization. The response then show a group of prosperous co-workers that accept the fact that they can have different opinions and yet work in harmony together and come to decisions that benefit the client. Most of our interviewing persons believe that leadership is about self-reflection, humbleness to oneself and others and to know the right time when to set clear boundaries...|$|R

50|$|According to {{the dual}} system of {{government}} established by Ngawang Namgyal in the 17th century, {{the powers of the}} government of Bhutan are ideally split between the religious <b>branch,</b> <b>headed</b> by the Je Khenpo, and the administrative <b>branch,</b> <b>headed</b> by the Druk Desi. The position of Je Khenpo is granted on merit by election, and typically is given to the most respected monk in the Dratshang Lhentshog (Commission for the Monastic Affairs). Thus, unlike reincarnation lineages such as the Dalai Lama, Zhabdrung Rinpoche, or Panchen Lama, the position of Je Khenpo is never held by a child but always by a seasoned monk.|$|R
