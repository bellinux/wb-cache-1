5000|$|The {{threshold}} {{limit value}} (TLV) of a chemical substance is a level {{to which it is}} believed a worker can be exposed day after day for a working lifetime without adverse effects. Strictly speaking, TLV is a reserved term of the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH). TLVs issued by the ACGIH are the most widely accepted occupational exposure limits both in the United States and most other countries. [...] However, it is sometimes loosely used to refer to other similar concepts used in occupational health and toxicology, such as acceptable daily intake (ADI) and tolerable daily intake (TDI). Concepts such as TLV, ADI, and TDI can be compared to the no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) in animal testing, but whereas a NOAEL can be established experimentally during a short period, TLV, ADI, and TDI apply to human beings over a lifetime and thus are harder to test empirically and are usually set at lower levels.

50|$|Increased {{concentrations}} of urinary beta-2 microglobulin {{can be an}} early indicator of renal dysfunction in persons chronically exposed to low but excessive levels of environmental cadmium. The urinary beta-2 microglobulin test is an indirect method of measuring cadmium exposure. Under some circumstances, the Occupational Health and Safety Administration requires screening for renal damage in workers with long-term exposure {{to high levels of}} cadmium. Blood or urine cadmium concentrations provide a better index of excessive exposure in industrial situations or following acute poisoning, whereas organ tissue (lung, liver, kidney) cadmium concentrations may be useful in fatalities resulting from either acute or chronic poisoning. Cadmium concentrations in healthy persons without excessive cadmium exposure are generally less than 1 μg/L in either blood or urine. The ACGIH <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> for blood and urine cadmium levels are 5 μg/L and 5 μg/g creatinine, respectively, in random specimens. Persons who have sustained renal damage due to chronic cadmium exposure often have blood or urine cadmium levels in a range of 25-50 μg/L or 25-75 μg/g creatinine, respectively. These ranges are usually 1000-3000 μg/L and 100-400 μg/g, respectively, in survivors of acute poisoning and may be substantially higher in fatal cases.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pyrrole adducts {{might be}} used as a {{biomarker}} for monitoring occupational exposure to n-hexane, but the <b>Biological</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Indices</b> of pyrrole adducts in serum and urine are still unknown. The current study was designed to investigate the biological exposure limit of pyrrole adducts for hazard assessment of n-hexane. METHODS: Male Wistar rats were given daily dose of 500, 1000, 1500, 2000, 4000 mg/kg bw n-hexane by gavage for 24 weeks. The levels of pyrrole adducts in serum and urine were determined at 8, 24 hours postdose once a week. The <b>Biological</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Indices</b> was evaluated by neurological evaluation and the levels of pyrrole adducts. The difference in pyrrole adducts formation between humans and rats were estimated by using in vitro test. RESULTS: Dose-dependent effects were observed between the doses of n-hexane and pyrrole adducts in serum and urine, and the levels of pyrrole adduct in serum and urine approached a plateau at week 4. There was a significantly negative correlation between the time to paralysis and the level of pyrrole adducts in serum and urine, while a positive correlation between gait score and levels of pyrrole adducts in serum and urine was observed. In vitro, pyrrole adducts formed in human serum was about two times more than those in rat serum at the same level of 2, 5 -HD. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the BEIs of pyrrole adducts in humans were 23. 1 ± 5. 91 nmol/ml in serum 8 h postdose, 11. 7 ± 2. 64 nmol/ml in serum 24 h postdose, 253. 8 ± 36. 3 nmol/ml in urine 8 h postdose and 54. 6 ± 15. 42 nmol/ml in urine 24 h postdose...|$|E

METHODS: Five volunteers (two men and three women) were dermally exposed to vaporised and liquid ME and EE. Dermal exposure on {{an area of}} about 1000 cm 2 (forearm and hand) to vapours of ME and EE (4000 mg/m 3 ME and 3700 mg/m 3 EE) lasted for 45 minutes. Duration of exposure to liquid ME and EE on an area of 27 cm 2 (forearm) was 15 minutes. Dermal uptake was assessed by measurement of the main metabolites in urinary methoxyacetic acid (MAA) and ethoxyacetic acid (EAA). For each volunteer, excretion of metabolites was compared with a reference inhalatory exposure. RESULTS: Mean (SD) absorption rates of ME and EE vapour were 36 (11) and 19 (6) cm/h respectively. The mean (SD) absorption rates of the liquid ME and EE amounted to 2. 9 (2. 0) and 0. 7 (0. 3) mg/cm 2. h. CONCLUSIONS: Vaporised and liquid ME and EE are readily absorbed through the skin. In the combined inhalatory and dermal exposure when whole body surface is exposed to vapour, the uptake through the skin {{is estimated to be}} 55 % of the total uptake of ME and 42 % of EE. Dermal uptake resulting from skin contact of both hands and forearms (about 2000 cm 2) with liquid ME and EE for 60 minutes would exceed inhalatory uptake of the eight hour occupational exposure limit by 100 times at 16 mg/m 3 of ME and 20 times at 19 mg/m 3 of EE. The substantial skin uptake of ME and EE indicates that in assessing the health risks biological monitoring and use of <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> are preferable to environmental monitoring...|$|E

These data {{have been used to}} calibrate a population toxicokinetic model, taking into account both the measurement uncertainty and intra- and interindividual variability. Using the calibrated model, urinary sampling sensitivity and specificity performance in detecting exposure above the 20 micro g/m 3 threshold limit value - time-weighted average (TLV-TWA) has been applied to identify an optimal urine sampling time. The UET value is obtained by minimizing misclassification rates in workplace exposures below or above the TLV. Total atmospheric cobalt concentrations are in the 5 - 144 micro g/m 3 range, and total urinary cobalt concentrations are 0. 5 - 88 micro g/g creatinine. A two-compartment toxicokinetic model best described urinary elimination. Terminal elimination half-time from the central compartment is 10. 0 hr (95 % confidence interval [8. 3 - 12. 3]). The optimal urinary sampling time has been identified as 3 hr before the end of shift at the end of workweek. If we assume that misclassification errors are of equal cost, the UET associated with the TLV of 20 micro g/m 3 is 5 micro g/L, which is lower than the ACGIH-recommended <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> of 15 micro g/L...|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims: n-Hexane {{is widely}} used in the {{production}} of glues, lacquers, paints, plastics, and rubber products. Consequently, a significant potential for exposure to this toxic solvent exists in industrial settings. This study was undertaken to assess the neurophysiological abnormalities in shoe-makers occupationally exposed to n-hexane and determine whether these abnormalities have any correlation with important occupational parameters. Materials and Methods: Neurophysiological examinations of upper and lower extremities were made in 27 male-workers, and the results were compared with a sex- and age-matched reference group. In addition, the extent of exposure of individual workers and their urinary concentration of free 2, 5 -hexanedione were determined. Data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (version 16. 0. for windows). Results: The time-weighted average exposure to n-hexane and the mean urinary concentration of free 2, 5 -hexanedione were both lower than the respective TLV-TWA and <b>Biological</b> <b>Exposure</b> <b>Index</b> (BEI) values proposed by ACGIH. Although neurological examinations and nerve conduction velocities were normal, significant negative correlations were observed between the urinary concentration of free 2, 5 -hexanedione and the sensory nerve action potential (SAP) amplitudes for median (r=- 0. 67, p< 0. 001) and sural (r=- 0. 52, p< 0. 008) nerves.

Urine samples were collected {{at the end of}} the work shift and before the start of the work shift the next morning (Tuesday and Friday). Mandelic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid were measured in the urine using a high pressure liquid chromatography method; values were expressed in milligrams/gram creatinine. Styrene TWA exposure values significantly correlated with the sum of metabolites {{at the end of the}} workday (r = 0. 60 on Monday and r = 0. 77 on Thursday) and also the next morning (r = 0. 87 on Tuesday and r = 0. 84 on Friday). Mandelic acid was always correlated with exposure better than phenylglyoxylic acid. A calculated styrene exposure level of 213 mg/m 3 (American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists threshold limit value) was associated with an excretion of metabolites (mandelic acid + phenylglyoxylic acid) higher on Thursday (921 mg/g creatinine) than on Monday (706 mg/g creatinine). The same observation was made on Friday (423 mg/g creatinine) as compared with Tuesday (315 mg/g creatinine). In conclusion, the threshold limit value of styrene was associated with different values of metabolites at the beginning and at the end of the workweek, and we must take this into account in establishing <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>indices.</b> Moreover, our data show that the excretion of mandelic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid is not modified by simultaneous exposure of the workers to acetone...|$|E
40|$|To {{estimate}} {{dermal absorption}} of vaporous and liquid 2 -methoxyethanol (ME) and 2 -ethoxyethanol (EE) in volunteers. Five volunteers (two men and three women) were dermally exposed to vaporised and liquid ME and EE. Dermal exposure on {{an area of}} about 1000 cm 2 (forearm and hand) to vapours of ME and EE (4000 mg/m 3 ME and 3700 mg/m 3 EE) lasted for 45 minutes. Duration of exposure to liquid ME and EE on an area of 27 cm 2 (forearm) was 15 minutes. Dermal uptake was assessed by measurement of the main metabolites in urinary methoxyacetic acid (MAA) and ethoxyacetic acid (EAA). For each volunteer, excretion of metabolites was compared with a reference inhalatory exposure. Mean (SD) absorption rates of ME and EE vapour were 36 (11) and 19 (6) cm/h respectively. The mean (SD) absorption rates of the liquid ME and EE amounted to 2. 9 (2. 0) and 0. 7 (0. 3) mg/cm 2. h. Vaporised and liquid ME and EE are readily absorbed through the skin. In the combined inhalatory and dermal exposure when whole body surface is exposed to vapour, the uptake through the skin {{is estimated to be}} 55 % of the total uptake of ME and 42 % of EE. Dermal uptake resulting from skin contact of both hands and forearms (about 2000 cm 2) with liquid ME and EE for 60 minutes would exceed inhalatory uptake of the eight hour occupational exposure limit by 100 times at 16 mg/m 3 of ME and 20 times at 19 mg/m 3 of EE. The substantial skin uptake of ME and EE indicates that in assessing the health risks biological monitoring and use of <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> are preferable to environmental monitorin...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{investigate}} whether exposure to phenolic resins (PR) {{is associated with}} quantitative olfactory disorders (QOD), a cross-sectional study of self-reported olfactory impairment (SROI) was performed in occupationally exposed subjects. Material and Methods: Sixty-six workers (45 males, 21 females) at the age (mean ± standard deviation) of 39. 8 ± 10. 15 years old were divided into 3 exposure groups {{on the basis of}} <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>indices</b> (BEI) for urinary phenols. It was asked whether the sense of smell has been normal or abnormal during the recent 2 months: the participants were eventually divided into self-reported normosmic, hyposmic, hyperosmic groups. Results: Prevalence of the SROI was 45. 5 %, with 21 (31. 8 %) workers complaining about the hyposmia, 12 (18. 2 %) – anosmia and 9 (13. 6 %) – hyperosmia. In univariate analyses, female sex was associated with the SROI and the hyperosmia. Highly exposed workers showed the SROI more frequently (odds ratio (OR) = 4. 714; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 077 – 20. 626) than those not exposed (reference) or low exposed (OR = 1. 333; 95 % CI: 0. 416 – 4. 274). In multivariate analyses, female sex was the main risk factor for the SROI (adjusted odds ratio (ORa) = 5. 622; 95 % CI: 1. 525 – 20. 722) and the hyperosmia (ORa = 25. 143; 95 % CI: 2. 379 – 265. 7) but a high exposure to phenol (ORa = 11. 133; 95 % CI: 1. 060 – 116. 9) was the main risk factor for the anosmia. Conclusions: This study has found slight evidence among the cross-section of chemical industry workers that the exposure to phenol may be associated with the SROI. On the other hand, self-reporting of the QOD may be biased by personal factors and further research with objective measurement is therefore required. Med Pr 2016; 67 (2) : 173 – 18...|$|E
40|$|Styrene is {{a commercially}} {{important}} chemical {{widely used in}} the manufacture of synthetic rubber, resins, polyesters and plastics. The highest levels of human exposure to styrene occur during the production of reinforced plastic products. The objective of this work was to evaluate both DNA and cytogenetic damage in styrene-exposed workers, analysing only non-smoker individuals. Environmental levels of styrene and urinary concentrations of mandelic and phenylglyoxylic acids were determined, and genetic damage was studied by means of micronucleus (MN) test, sister chromatid exchanges (SCEs) and comet assay. Fifty-two fibreglass-reinforced plastics workers and 54 controls took part in the study. The mean air concentration of styrene in the breathing zone of workers exceeded the threshold limit value, and 24 workers exceeded the <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>index.</b> A strong and significant correlation was found between styrene environmental concentrations and urinary metabolites. Higher SCE rate (P< 0. 01) was observed in exposed workers than in controls. Besides, significant correlations were obtained for SCE rate with both environmental and internal exposure parameters (r= 0. 496, P< 0. 01 and r= 0. 511, P< 0. 01, respectively). Results from MN test and comet assay showed slight and non-significant increases related to the exposure. Our data seem to support previous studies reporting genotoxicity associated with occupational exposure to styrene, excluding the confounding influence of smoking, although caution must be taken in the interpretation of these results since the significance of an increase in SCE rate is still unclear...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{this study}} has been to {{investigate}} serum activities of liver enzymes in workers exposed to sub-TLV levels of dimethylformamide (DMF). Material and Methods: Seventy-two workers and 72 healthy controls participated in the study. All subjects underwent complete physical examinations and abdominal ultrasound examination. Serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and c-glutamyl transpeptidase (c-GT) were determined by an auto-chemistry analyzer. The data of airborne concentrations of DMF was obtained from the local Center of Disease Control and Prevention. The level of urine N-acetyl-S-(N-methylcarbamoyl) cysteine (AMCC) was measured by means of high-performance liquid chromatography. Results: Time weighted average (TWA) concentration of the DMF in workplace was 18. 6 (range: 9. 8 – 36. 2) mg/m 3. The concentration of the AMCC in workers’ urine was 28. 32 (range: 1. 8 – 58. 6) mg/l and 9 workers’ AMCC exceeded the <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> (40 mg/l). Thirty-one workers reported gastrointestinal symptoms (abdominal pain, nausea, anorexia) and 10 workers reported headache, dizziness and/or palpitation in the exposed group. Serum analysis revealed that both the mean of serum activities of liver enzymes (ALT, AST and c-GT) and the percentage of workers with abnormal liver function were significantly higher in the exposed group as compared to the controls. Conclusions: Dimethylformamide can cause liver damage even if air concentration is in the sub-threshold limit value (sub-TLV) level. The protection of skin contact against the exposure to the DMF might be a critical issue as far as the occupational health is concerned...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{examine the}} {{correlation}} between airborne 2 -methoxy ethanol (ME) exposures and the urinary 2 -methoxy acetic acid (MAA) and to recommend a <b>biological</b> <b>exposure</b> <b>index</b> (BEI) for ME. METHODS: 8 Hour time weighted average (TWA) personal breathing zone samples and urine samples {{before and after the}} shift were collected from Monday to Saturday for 27 workers exposed to ME and on Friday for 30 control workers. RESULTS: No correlation was found between airborne exposure to ME and urinary MAA for nine special operation workers due to the use of personal protective equipment. For 18 regular operation workers, a significant correlation (r = 0. 702, p = 0. 001) was found between urinary MAA (mg/g creatinine) on Friday {{at the end of the}} shift and the weekly mean exposures of ME in a 5 day working week. The proposed BEI, which corresponds to exposure for 5 days and 8 hours a day to 5 ppm, extrapolated from the regression equation is 40 mg MAA/g creatinine. A significant correlation was also found between the weekly increase of urinary MAA (Friday after the shift minus Monday before the shift) and the weekly mean exposures of ME (r = 0. 741). The recommended value of the weekly increase of urinary MAA for 5 days repeated exposures of 5 ppm ME is 20 mg/g creatinine. No urinary MAA was detected in workers in the non-exposed control group. CONCLUSIONS: The Friday urinary MAA after the shift or the weekly increase of urinary MAA is a specific and a good biomarker of weekly exposure to ME...|$|R
