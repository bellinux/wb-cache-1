5|$|The ice {{crystals}} in cirrus clouds have different shapes {{in addition to}} different sizes. Some shapes include solid columns, hollow columns, plates, rosettes, and conglomerations of the various other types. The shape of the {{ice crystals}} {{is determined by the}} air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice supersaturation. Cirrus in temperate regions typically have the shapes segregated by type: the columns and plates tend to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the cloud, whereas the rosettes and conglomerations tend to be near the base. In the northern Arctic region, cirrus tend to be composed of only the columns, plates, and conglomerations, and these crystals tend to be at least four times larger than the minimum size. In Antarctica, cirrus are usually composed of only the columns, and these columns are much longer than normal.|$|E

25|$|The {{requirement}} of road signals that a stop light should be visible over a queue of traffic {{and as far}} back as possible (thus demanding an order with red above) does not apply to railways with a block signalling system as there is no traffic queuing within a block, there being only one train in a block at a time. With railway signals, red need not <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> for maximum visibility over distance as the driver of a train will already be expecting a red signal, having passed a yellow one in the previous block. This advance warning is missing with road signals.|$|E
25|$|In 2012, {{she became}} one of four judges for the current hot show in Vietnam The Voice of Vietnam.

She is claimed to be the most favourite judge by contestants and audiences due to her strong voice and notable experiences throughout the show. The reality show presented another aspects of Thu Minh in terms of bold multi-talent, being sensitive, loving, sincere, skillful and witty without aggressiveness. With tactful sanity from setting up the place – at the castle of Khai Silk – to directly mentoring and inviting selectively elite support from musician Nguyen Hai Phong and Vietnam's diva Hồng Nhung in order to fulfill all students with skillful and advantageous performance and tutorials, Thu Minh's team was expected to be a prosperous package of surprises and marvellous creativity each night.|$|E

25|$|The name Brixton {{is thought}} to {{originate}} from Brixistane, meaning the stone of Brixi, a Saxon lord. Brixi {{is thought to}} have erected a boundary stone to mark the meeting place of the ancient hundred court of Surrey. The location is unknown but is thought to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of Brixton Hill, at a road known at the time as Bristow or Brixton Causeway, long before any settlement in the area. Brixton marks the rise from the marshes of North Lambeth up to the hills of Upper Norwood and Streatham. At the time the River Effra flowed from its source in Upper Norwood through Herne Hill to Brixton. At Brixton the river was crossed by low bridges for Roman roads to the south coast of Britain, now Brixton Road and Clapham Road. The main roads were connected through a network of medieval country lanes, such as Acre Lane, Coldharbour Lane, Brixton Water Lane and Lyham Road, formerly Black Lane. It was only {{at the end of the}} 18th century that villages and settlements formed around Brixton, as the original woodland was gradually reduced until the area was covered in farmland and market gardens known for game and strawberries.|$|E

In {{the second part of}} a {{behind the scenes}} look of 4 Intimate Nights with Beyoncé, it is revealed that Beyoncé {{was in charge of the}} orchestra's design and stage set-up, stating that a three level stage would be needed, allowing the back-up singers to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> and the orchestra to be on the same level as Beyoncé herself, as to allow viewers to see them.|$|E

As team captain at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, he was noted for helping his teammates understand everything that was going on around them. His athleticism and personal courage have been praised by those who know him, such as Michael Page, chef d’equipe for the 1986 US World Championship team, who recounted how Plumb medaled at the competition despite three broken ribs. Plumb admits to being completely focused on riding and [...] "not a social person", with former coach Jack le Goff saying that [...] "horses are his only reason for being on earth".|$|E

500|$|Altocumulus {{clouds are}} a middle-étage cloud that forms from [...] high to [...] in polar areas, [...] in {{temperate}} areas, and [...] in tropical areas. They can have precipitation and are commonly {{composed of a}} mixture of ice crystals, supercooled water droplets, and water droplets in temperate latitudes. However, the liquid water concentration was almost always significantly greater than the concentration of ice crystals, and the maximum concentration of liquid water tended to <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the cloud while the ice concentrated itself at the bottom. The ice crystals {{in the base of}} the altocumulus clouds and in the virga were found to be dendrites or conglomerations of dendrites while needles and plates resided more towards the top. Altocumulus clouds can form via convection or via the forced uplift caused by a warm front. Because Altocumulus is a genus-type of limited convection, it is divided into the same four species as cirrocumulus.|$|E
500|$|On 17 July 2009, Del Piero {{extended}} {{his contract with}} Juventus by one more year until 30 June 2011 in Pinzolo while training for pre-season, thus practically ensuring that he would retire at the club with which he started his professional career. During his renewal, he said, [...] "I am happy at Juventus and we are competitive. I want to keep playing {{for as long as}} I can and I'm certain that for at least two more years I will <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> level." [...] On 14 February 2010, Del Piero marked his 445th Serie A appearance, breaking the all-time club record previously held by Boniperti, with a brace in a 3–2 win against Genoa. Del Piero finished the season as the all-time top scorer for Juventus, having scored over 250 goals in all competitions with the club, and having also made over 600 appearances in official matches for Juventus, breaking Scirea's appearance record.|$|E
500|$|As well {{as trying}} to take over Lassiter's, Diana also wants to [...] "settle a score with Paul Robinson". Paul stands in her way of {{achieving}} her goal as his place within the company is secure for life as Diana's boss, Rosemary Daniels (Joy Chambers), is Paul's aunt. Badler explained that Diana resents Paul as she is not part of his family and knows that she cannot ever <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top.</b> Further to that, Paul and Diana were once lovers and Diana fell in love with him, but he walked out on her and broke her heart. Stefan Dennis said that Paul and Diana's relationship came at a time when Paul was [...] "a philandering playboy and didn't care." [...] Paul became one of a few men that Diana has ever fallen in love with and because he treated her badly, she decides to bring him down. Badler said that Diana has been keeping an eye on Paul and knows everything about what he has been up to. Following her arrival, Diana begins to make Paul's life [...] "a nightmare" [...] and Badler said [...] "Diana's back to force him {{to fall in love with}} her again, or destroy him – whichever comes first".|$|E

500|$|Changeling {{sits with}} other late-period Eastwood films in which parenting—and {{the search for}} family—is a theme. It makes literal the parental {{struggle}} to communicate with children. It {{can also be seen}} as a variation of the Eastwood [...] "revenge movie" [...] ethic; in this case, the [...] "avenging grunt" [...] transforms into a courteous woman who only once makes a foul-mouthed outburst. Eastwood dealt with themes of child endangerment in A Perfect World(1993) and Mystic River(2003). Changeling is a thematic companion piece to Mystic River, which also depicted a community contaminated by an isolated, violent act against a child—a comparison with which Eastwood agreed. He said that showing a child in danger was [...] "about the highest form of drama you can have", as crimes against them were to him the most horrible. Eastwood explained that crimes against children represented a theft of lives and innocence. He said, [...] "When [...] comes along quite as big as this one, you question humanity. It never ceases to surprise me how cruel humanity can be." [...] Samuel Blumenfeld of Le Monde said the scene featuring Northcott's execution by hanging was [...] "unbearable" [...] due to its attention to detail; he believed {{it one of the most}} convincing pleas against the death penalty imaginable. Eastwood noted that for a supporter of capital punishment, Northcott was an ideal candidate, and that in a perfect world the death penalty might be an appropriate punishment for such a crime. He said that crimes against children would <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of his list for justifications of capital punishment, but that whether one were pro- or anti-capital punishment, the barbarism of public executions must be recognized. Eastwood argued that in putting the guilty party before his victims' families, justice may be done, but after such a spectacle the family would find it hard to find peace. The scene's realism was deliberate: the audience hears Northcott's neck breaking, his body swings, and his feet shake. It was Eastwood's intention to make it unbearable to watch.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2008–09 NHL season, Panthers head coach Peter DeBoer, who first saw Horton play at seven years old, said about his hopes for Horton, [...] "If I'm looking for guys to do more, he wouldn't <b>be</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>top</b> of the list. If he can give us 30-plus, I'd be happy with Nathan. There's a group of guys {{underneath}} him that I think can make a lot bigger jumps than I need out of Nathan Horton goal-wise." [...] Horton was also moved from his position of right wing to centre before the season. After playing a few games at centre, Horton said, [...] "It's not as easy as wing. You can play wing and all you have to concentrate on is getting the puck and shooting it. At center, you have more responsibilities." [...] Against the Nashville Predators on November 1, Horton played in his 300th career game, but failed to record a point. On November 26, Horton suffered a deep cut in his leg after it was stepped on by a skate. At the time of the injury, Horton had 6 goals and 7 assists. In early December, the Ottawa Sun reported that the Panthers might have been looking to trade Horton after he was reportedly unhappy playing for the team. Horton returned to the lineup on December 17 after missing eight games. After the game, Horton commented, [...] "I'm excited to play. It's kind of a different Panthers team than the past. It's really changed in a matter of a month. Things are going good now, and everybody's really buying into what Pete has been telling us all year." [...] On January 17, Horton recorded 3 assists to help the Panthers defeat Tampa Bay, 43. For the second time during the season, Horton's name came up in trade rumours, this time with the Chicago Blackhawks. In early March, days after the trade deadline, Horton suffered a finger injury that forced him to have surgery. He returned to the lineup on March 23, recording an assist in a Panthers loss to the Carolina Hurricanes. Horton ended the season with 22 goals and 23 assists in 67 games.|$|E
