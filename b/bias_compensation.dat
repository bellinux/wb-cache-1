In the Crytek Sponza the clamped volumetric and surface illumination was rendered in 39 minutes (using 118 k VPLs), while the missing energy was recovered using a two-bounce ABC in only 13 minutes. In this paper we present a novel method for high-quality rendering of scenes with participating media. Our technique is based on instant radiosity, which is used to approximate indirect illumination between surfaces by gathering light from a set of virtual point lights (VPLs). It has been shown that this principle can be applied to participating media as well, so that the combined single scattering contribution of VPLs within the medium yields full multiple scattering. As in the surface case, VPL methods for participating media are prone to singularities, which appear as bright “splotches ” in the image. These artifacts are usually countered by clamping the VPLs’ contribution, but this leads to energy loss within the short-distance light transport. <b>Bias</b> <b>compensation</b> recovers the missing energy, but previous approaches are prohibitively costly.

Choosing fixed priors also has the benefit of decoupling the noise power estimator from subsequent steps in a speech enhancement framework, such as the estimation of the speech power and the estimation of the clean speech. We show that the proposed SPP approach maintains the quick noise tracking performance of the bias compensated MMSE-based approach while exhibiting less overestimation of the spectral noise power and an even lower computational complexity.

40|$|In most {{applications}} of high speed op amps, {{it is the}} total output rms noise that is generally of interest. Because of the high bandwidths involved, the chief contributor to the output rms noise is therefore the white noise, and the 1 /f noise is negligible. Typical high speed op amps have bandwidths greater than 150 MHz or so, and bipolar voltage feedback (VFB) input stages have input voltage noises ranging from about 1 to 20 nV/√Hz. For a VFB op amp, the inverting and non-inverting input current noise are typically equal, and almost always uncorrelated. Typical values for wideband VFB op amps range from 0. 5 to 5 pA/√Hz. The input current noise of a bipolar input stage is increased when input bias-current compensation generators are added, because their current noise is not correlated, and therefore adds (in a root-sum-square manner) to the intrinsic current noise of the bipolar stage. However, <b>bias</b> current <b>compensation</b> is rarely used in high speed op amps. The input voltage noise in current feedback (CFB) op amps tends to be lower than for VFB op amps having the same approximate bandwidth. This is because the input stage in a CFB op amp is usually operated at a higher current, thereby reducing the emitter resistance and hence the voltage noise. Typical values for CFB op amps range from about 1 to 5 nV/√Hz...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{increasing}} use of functional connectivity (FC) studies in fundamental and clinical research, the link between FC and behavior is still poorly understood. To test the hypothesis that artificial modulation of FC correlates with changes in behavior in a quantitative manner, we performed behavioral and resting state fMRI experiments in monkeys while perturbing, offline, the frontal eye fields (FEF) using unilateral continuous theta burst transcranial magnetic stimulation (FEF-cTBS). Stimulation of left and right FEF caused remarkably specific decreases in FC, which were symmetric for intra-hemispheric and asymmetric for inter-hemispheric FC. Surprisingly, FEF-cTBS improved the performance and compensated intrinsic choice biases in saccadic behavior of four monkeys, independent of the initial bias direction. Moreover, the direction of the stimulation-induced effects on both behavior (i. e. <b>bias</b> <b>compensation)</b> and FC (i. e. decrease) were independent of the stimulated hemisphere, while their magnitude depended on the side of stimulation, choice bias and monkey. Overall, the naturally-occurring saccade biases determined the FC changes following FEF-cTBS. Finally, we showed that the average decreases in FC in the FEF network induced by cTBS can be used to predict, with high specificity, both the direction (opposite to the saccadic biases) and the magnitude of the shift in saccadic choice preference relative to the unperturbed state. To reconcile the apparent contradiction between improved performance and <b>bias</b> <b>compensation</b> vs. decrease in functional connectivity, we propose that the main functional consequences of FEF-cTBS relate to adjusting inter-hemispheric imbalances. status: publishe...|$|E
