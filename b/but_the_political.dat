5|$|However, much of {{the blame}} for the decay and ruinous state of {{preservation}} of so many palazzi must fall not just on owners unwilling to accept change, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> agendas of successive socialist governments. Some of the finest Baroque villas and palazzi, including the Palermo palace of the Prince of Lampedusa, are still in ruins following the United States bombing raids of 1943. In many cases, no attempt has been made to restore or even secure them. Those that survived the raids in good repair are often sub-divided into offices or apartments, their Baroque interiors dismantled, divided, and sold.|$|E
5|$|Dzungariotherium orgosensis was {{described}} in 1973 based on fossilsmainly teethfrom Dzungaria in Xinjiang, northwest China. In 2017, a new species, P. huangheense, was named based on jaw elements from the Hanjiajing Formation in the Gansu Province of China; the name refers to the nearby Huanghe River. P. huangheense differs from P. bugtiense only in the anatomy of the rear portion of the jaw, {{as well as its}} larger size. A multitude of other species and genus namesmostly based on differences in size, snout shape, and front tooth arrangementhave been coined for various indricothere remains.

5|$|The Collections {{include a}} unique proof sheet of 26 Revenue 1765 Newspaper and Pamphlet one penny {{impressions}} showing the registration certificate, {{held in the}} Board of Inland Revenue Stamping Department Archive. These were issued to apply the Stamp Act of 1765 intended to raise taxes to fund the defence of the American Colonies from the French. The tax applied to legal documents, licences, newspapers, pamphlets and almanacs in the American Colonies, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Florida, the Bahamas and the West Indian Islands. The taxes resulted in public protest and rioting. The tax was abandoned {{after a few months}} due to its unpopularity <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> damage contributed to the War of Independence in 1775.|$|E
5|$|In January 1827, the General Assembly {{considered}} {{whether to}} elect U.S. Senator John Randolph {{for a full}} six-year term. Randolph was a contentious figure; although he shared the staunch states' rights views held {{by most of the}} Virginia legislature, he had a reputation for fiery rhetoric and erratic behavior on the Senate floor, which put his allies in an awkward position. Furthermore, he had made enemies by fiercely opposing President John Quincy Adams and Kentucky Senator Henry Clay. The nationalists of the Democratic-Republican Party, who supported Adams and Clay, were a sizable minority in the Virginia legislature. They hoped to unseat Randolph by capturing the vote of states' rights supporters who were uncomfortable with the senator's reputation. They approached Tyler, and promised their endorsement if he sought the seat. Tyler repeatedly declined the offer, endorsing Randolph as the best candidate, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> pressure continued to mount. Eventually he agreed to accept the seat if chosen. On the day of the vote, one assemblyman argued there was no political difference between the two candidates—Tyler was merely more agreeable than Randolph. The incumbent's supporters, though, contended that Tyler's election would be a tacit endorsement of the Adams administration. The legislature selected Tyler in a vote of 115–110, and he resigned his governorship on March 4, 1827, as his Senate term began.|$|E

25|$|As for the Chinese, I {{have the}} highest opinion {{not only of the}} Chinese character, but of the Chinese fitness for self-government.

In fact, China has always been practically a republic. It has had its dynasties of rulers, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> unit of China has always been the village.

25|$|As {{early as}} 1651, the English {{government}} {{had sought to}} regulate trade in the American colonies. On October 9, the Navigation Acts were passed to ensure that trade enriched only Britain, barring trade with other nations. Some argue that the economic impact was minimal on the colonists, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> friction which the acts triggered was more serious, as the merchants most directly affected were most politically active. King Philip's War ended in 1678, {{and much of it}} was fought without significant assistance from England.

The following year, she led her party to win a plurality of seats in the Knesset, but was again blocked from becoming prime minister, due to the rightist parties' majority in the Knesset.

500|$|While {{defending}} the role Moldavian {{politicians in the}} 1840s had in shaping modern Romanian culture, Ibrăileanu argued that practices {{such as those of}} Heliade and Laurian carried the risk of [...] "suppressing the Romanian language", and credited Alecu Russo, more than his successors at Junimea, with providing a passionate defense of spoken Romanian. He notably cited Russo's verdict: [...] "The modern political hatred aimed at [...] has thrown us into Italianism, into Frenchism, and into other -isms, that were not and are not Romanianism, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> perils, in respect to the enslavement of the Romanian soul, have since passed; true Romanianism ought to hold its head up high". The literary critic George Călinescu also connected Heliade's experimentation to his Russophobia, in turn reflecting his experiences as a revolutionary: [...] "Hating Slavism and the Russians, who had striven to underline , he said to himself that he was to serve his motherland by discarding all Slavic vestiges". Călinescu notably attributed Heliade's inconsistency to his [...] "autodidacticism", which, he contended, was responsible for [...] " [...] casual implication in all issues, the unexpected move from common sense ideas to the most insane theories".|$|E

Early in his Presidency, Thiers declared, [...] "In general, the country is wise, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>political</b> parties are not. It is these, and only these, that we have to fear.
