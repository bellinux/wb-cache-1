Freda Caspersen was one of the company's directors.|$|E
5|$|After the Dutch {{had driven}} the Swedish out of Butre, the {{director}} general of the Dutch West India Company, with headquarters in St. George d'Elmina in the central Gold Coast, decided that it would be <b>beneficial</b> to negotiate a treaty with the local political leadership in order to establish a peaceful long-term relationship. The Ahanta leaders found it equally <b>beneficial</b> to enter into such an agreement. The 1656 treaty signalled the definitive switch in European jurisdiction in the area until 1872.|$|E
5|$|Although spiders are {{generally}} regarded as predatory, the jumping spider Bagheera kiplingi gets over 90% of its food from fairly solid plant material produced by acacias {{as part of a}} mutually <b>beneficial</b> relationship with a species of ant.|$|E
5|$|Annuity and Life-Income Funds are {{resources}} {{provided by}} donors where {{the organization has}} a <b>beneficial</b> interest but is not the sole beneficiary. These may include charitable gift annuities or life income funds.|$|E
5|$|August 5, 2008– Tropical Storm Edouard makes {{landfall}} near Port Arthur with winds near 65mph. Edouard provides <b>beneficial</b> rain to {{a drought}} stricken central Texas.|$|E
5|$|Finn Michael Westby Caspersen Sr. (October 27, 1941– September 7, 2009) was an American {{financier}} and philanthropist. A {{graduate of}} Brown University and Harvard Law School, he followed his father, Olaus Caspersen, a Norwegian immigrant to the United States, {{as chairman and}} chief executive of <b>Beneficial</b> Corporation, one of the largest consumer finance companies in the United States.

5|$|For {{those who}} are {{disturbed}} {{by the appearance of}} lentigines, cryosurgery may be <b>beneficial.</b> Due to the large number of lentigines this may prove time consuming. An alternative treatment with tretinoin or hydroquinone creams may help.|$|E
5|$|Fungi play {{a variety}} of roles in human culture, both <b>beneficial</b> and harmful.|$|E
5|$|God must be good, Paley argues, {{because in}} many cases the designs seen in nature are <b>beneficial,</b> and because animals {{perceive}} pleasure, beyond what would be strictly necessary. Pain is admitted to exist, but even such things as venomous bites of snakes exist to a good end, namely defence or the capture of prey. Pain too is mitigated, as in intervals between the acute pain of gout which are <b>beneficial</b> to sufferers. The appearance of chance, too, is necessary in the world.|$|E
5|$|In {{further studies}} {{conducted}} by Dr. Norman K. Hollenberg, {{professor of medicine}} at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School found that flavonols may also help vessels dilate and help keep platelets from clustering on the blood vessel walls. Flavonoids found in hot chocolate are <b>beneficial</b> to health mainly because they shield the walls of blood vessels from free radical damage. Flavanols are also thought to help reduce blood platelet buildup and can balance levels of compounds called eicosanoids, which may be <b>beneficial</b> to cardiovascular health.|$|E
5|$|It is <b>beneficial</b> to give fluids, as {{this helps}} reduce dehydration. It {{is no longer}} {{recommended}} to administer aspirin, unless advised {{to do so by}} medical personnel, as analgesics may mask symptoms. People should be made comfortable and placed in the supine position (horizontal), or the recovery position if vomiting occurs. In the past, both the Trendelenburg position and the left lateral decubitus position (Durant's maneuver) have been suggested as <b>beneficial</b> where air emboli are suspected, but are no longer recommended for extended periods, owing to concerns regarding cerebral edema.|$|E
5|$|Jacques Pitrat {{claims that}} some kind of {{artificial}} conscience is <b>beneficial</b> in artificial intelligence systems to improve their long-term performance and direct their introspective processing.|$|E
5|$|July 20–21, 1966 – Hurricane Celia to {{the west}} douses Bermuda with heavy but <b>beneficial</b> rain.|$|E
5|$|May 23, 1976- Subtropical Storm One strikes near Saint Marks, {{producing}} {{slightly above}} normal tides, minor beach erosion, and <b>beneficial</b> precipitation.|$|E
5|$|October 19, 1968– Hurricane Gladys passes just offshore, {{bringing}} {{moderate to}} heavy rainfall across the state; the rainfall is <b>beneficial</b> due to previously dry conditions.|$|E
5|$|Relative advantage: is {{the degree}} to which the new {{behavior}} is believed to accrue more <b>beneficial</b> outcomes than current practice.|$|E
5|$|September 13, 1970– The {{precursor}} {{tropical depression}} to Tropical Storm Felice {{passes through the}} Florida Keys, dropping <b>beneficial</b> rainfall to the southern portion of the state.|$|E
5|$|September 26, 1956– The extratropical {{remains of}} Hurricane Flossy produce {{moderate}} rainfall {{across much of}} the state, which is <b>beneficial</b> after previous dry conditions.|$|E
5|$|Small {{amounts of}} CO are <b>beneficial</b> and enzymes exist that produce it {{at times of}} {{oxidative}} stress. Drugs are being developed to introduce small amounts of CO during certain kinds of surgery, these drugs are called carbon monoxide-releasing molecules.|$|E
5|$|Snyder's response, {{and that}} of other fans, {{reflects}} the psychology of identification with sports teams. Self-esteem becomes bound to {{the players and the}} team, with many <b>beneficial</b> but also some unfortunate consequences, including denial or rationalization of misbehavior.|$|E
5|$|Some probiotics {{have been}} shown to be <b>beneficial</b> in {{reducing}} both the duration of illness and the frequency of stools. They may also be useful in preventing and treating antibiotic associated diarrhea. Fermented milk products (such as yogurt) are similarly <b>beneficial.</b> Zinc supplementation appears to be effective in both treating and preventing diarrhea among children in the developing world.|$|E
5|$|Some yoga {{practitioners}} do {{not recommend}} certain yoga exercises for women during menstruation, for pregnant women, or for nursing mothers. However, meditation, breathing exercises, and certain postures which {{are safe and}} <b>beneficial</b> for women in these categories are encouraged.|$|E
5|$|The Bundled Measures Policy authorizes {{different}} factions {{within the}} state to collaborate on mitigation projects. This policy takes a more of a community-based approach by adding several groups {{for the purpose of}} multiple perspectives and inventive approaches. The Bundled Measures Policy is one method that generates co-benefits for both parties. In example, if a partaking business were to add cool roofs, there will be a reduction in greenhouse gases which is <b>beneficial</b> for the environment as well as the need for excess energy which is <b>beneficial</b> for the business.|$|E
5|$|The bats' diet {{makes this}} species <b>beneficial</b> to {{agriculture}} as it eats {{many species of}} agricultural pests.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{bacteria in the}} stomach may be <b>beneficial,</b> reducing the prevalence of asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses.|$|E
5|$|A 2013/4 {{survey by}} the National Association for Business Economics found that about 75 percent of those {{surveyed}} said ACA hadn’t influenced their planning or expectations for 2014, and 85 percent said the law wouldn’t prompt a change in their hiring practices. Some 21 percent of 64 businesses surveyed said that the act would have a harmful effect and 5 percent said it would be <b>beneficial.</b>|$|E
5|$|A population's genetic {{variation}} can be greatly reduced by a bottleneck, and even <b>beneficial</b> adaptations may be permanently eliminated. The loss of variation leaves the surviving population vulnerable to any new selection pressures such as disease, climate change or {{shift in the}} available food source, because adapting in response to environmental changes requires sufficient {{genetic variation}} in the population for natural selection to take place.|$|E
5|$|A related {{argument}} against evolution {{is that most}} mutations are harmful. However, {{the vast majority of}} mutations are neutral, and the minority of mutations which are <b>beneficial</b> or harmful are often situational; a mutation that is harmful in one environment may be helpful in another.|$|E
5|$|A ship's <b>beneficial</b> {{owner is}} legally and financially {{responsible}} for the ship and its activities. For any {{of a number of}} reasons, some justifiable and some suspicious, shipowners who wish to conceal their ownership may use a number of strategies to achieve that goal.|$|E
5|$|Ants perform many {{ecological}} {{roles that}} are <b>beneficial</b> to humans, including {{the suppression of}} pest populations and aeration of the soil. The use of weaver ants in citrus cultivation in southern China {{is considered one of}} the oldest known applications of biological control. On the other hand, ants may become nuisances when they invade buildings, or cause economic losses.|$|E
5|$|Aposematism is {{paradoxical}} {{in evolutionary}} terms, {{as it makes}} individuals conspicuous to predators, so they may be killed and the trait eliminated before predators learn to avoid it. If warning colouration puts the first few individuals at such a strong disadvantage, it would never last in the species long enough to become <b>beneficial.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around 1924, Prokofiev was {{introduced}} to Christian Science. He began to practice its teachings, which he believed to be <b>beneficial</b> to his health and to his fiery temperament and to which he remained faithful {{for the rest of}} his life, according to biographer Simon Morrison.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{is thought}} to reduce the overall risk of both getting cancer and dying from cancer. This effect is {{particularly}} <b>beneficial</b> for colorectal cancer (CRC). It may also slightly {{reduce the risk of}} endometrial cancer, breast cancer, and prostate cancer.|$|E
5|$|August 17, 1981- Tropical Storm Dennis makes {{landfall}} on {{the southwest}} portion of the state, and drifts northeastward across the state. The rainfall is generally <b>beneficial,</b> though totals of over 20inches (500mm) cause moderate flooding damage in southeastern Florida, including $15million ($36million 2008USD) in crop damages in Dade County.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen {{has some}} of the highest gross wages in the world. High taxes mean that wages are reduced after {{mandatory}} deduction. A <b>beneficial</b> researcher scheme with low taxation of foreign specialists has made Denmark an attractive location for foreign labour. It is however also among the most expensive cities in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{considerable}} research, {{there is}} little scientific evidence that yoga is <b>beneficial</b> for physical health, and it may cause muscular or spinal injuries, although it may improve mental health both for healthy people and for those with illnesses. Clinical studies on {{the health effects of}} yoga generally are of poor quality.|$|E
