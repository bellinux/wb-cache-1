Anxious to revenge {{themselves against}} the Austro-Hungarians, the Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) planned {{an attack on the}} two ships in their berths in the Bay of Muggia, near Trieste, by MAS boats. On the night of 9/10 December, two MAS boats managed to penetrate the harbor defenses undetected, and fired torpedoes at Wien and <b>Budapest.</b> The torpedoes fired at the <b>Budapest</b> struck the mole of the seaplane station, but Wien was hit twice and capsized in five minutes, killing 46 of the crew.|$|E

5|$|Capturing Fort <b>Budapest</b> fell {{within the}} {{responsibility}} of the Port Said Sector, an Egyptian military command independent of the Second Field Army to the south. The commander of the sector, Major General Omar Khalid, assigned the task of capturing the fort to the 135th Independent Infantry Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Salah 'Abd el-Halim. The 135th was also tasked with capturing another position, Fort Orkal, so Salah committed one battalion under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Ali al-Mezahi to capture <b>Budapest.</b> However, Salah had the following reinforcements: six obsolete T-34 tanks equipped with mine flails to breach the Israeli minefield, eight amphibious armored vehicles, a 120 mm mortar company, and a company of the 128th Sa'iqa Group (Sa'iqa, meaning lightning, were Egyptian commando forces). The Sa'iqa company would join the attack via a naval landing and would be separated into two groups. One group would land four kilometers east of <b>Budapest</b> to isolate it and prevent Israeli reinforcements from reaching the fort. The other group would land one kilometer east of <b>Budapest,</b> and then attack the fort. The main assault would come from the west, to be carried out by the battalion and the six tanks. The battalion would attack from Port Fouad, {{the only part of the}} Sinai under Egyptian control.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Rona {{was born}} on 20 March 1890 in <b>Budapest,</b> Hungary, to Ida, (née Mahler) and Samuel Róna. Her father was a prosperous Jewish {{physician}} who worked with Louis Wickham and Henri-August Dominici, founders of radium therapy, to introduce the techniques to <b>Budapest,</b> and installed {{one of the first}} x-ray machines there. Elizabeth wanted to become a physician like her father, but Samuel believed that it would be too difficult for a woman to attain. Though he died when she was in her second year of university, Rona's father had encouraged her and spurred her interest in science from a young age. She enrolled in the Philosophy Faculty at the University of <b>Budapest,</b> studying chemistry, geochemistry, and physics, receiving her PhD in 1912.|$|E

5|$|In a Chess Notes feature article, Edward Winter {{showed that}} the origins of this opening are not yet entirely elucidated. The first known game with the <b>Budapest</b> Gambit is Adler–Maróczy (played in <b>Budapest</b> in 1896). This game already {{featured}} some key aspects of the gambit, such as active play for the black pieces, and White making the typical mistake of moving the queen too early. As the player of the white pieces was not a strong player, the new opening went unnoticed apart from the local experts who had witnessed the game. The Hungarians István Abonyi, Zsigmond Barász and Gyula Breyer further developed the opening. Abonyi played it in 1916 against the Dutch surgeon Johannes Esser in a small tournament in <b>Budapest.</b> The Austrian player Josef Emil Krejcik played it against Helmer in Vienna in 1917. Carl Schlechter published an optimistic analysis of the gambit in the Deutsche Schachzeitung.|$|E

The Sa'iqa company continued to hold its positions east of <b>Budapest</b> for four days, until Salah decided to withdraw it due to the casualties it had sustained.|$|E
