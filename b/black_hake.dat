This {{is a highly}} specialised fishery, with two species of <b>black</b> <b>hake</b> (Merluccius senegalensis and Merluccius polli) constituting between 77 – 99 % of total land-ings, which have annually averaged 9 300 tons {{over the past two}} decades. Landings of Sparidae were highest among by-catch species of commercial value, with the large-eye dentex, Dentex macrophthal-mus being the most important until 1996, after which the family Lophiidae and others predominated. Next were the Elasmobranchii, including large demersal squalids and several species of rays, although their annual landings fell from 182 tons in 1992 to only 4 tons in 1999, rising to 37 tons in 2001. The present paper analyses these changes using by-catches retained in the <b>black</b> <b>hake</b> fishery. We believe that the decline could be due to a set of different factors: a change in depths fished, economic reasons and probable over-exploitation of both targeted species and by-catch. Elasmobranchs constituted only 0. 1 % of total landings in 1999, compared to 1. 9 % in 1992, although their contribution to total com-mercial by-catch was constant. Seasonality was clearly evident, with an absolute and proportional rise in elasmobranch by-catch during warm periods, reaching 75 % of by-catch landings in some months, coinciding with a drop in total by-catch. These seasonal variations could be related to the migratory habits of the fishery's target species, <b>black</b> <b>hake...</b>|$|E
40|$|Fish {{populations and}} {{fisheries}} fluctuations are {{closely linked to}} climate dynamics through environmental variability that determines distribution, migration, and abundance. Fisheries science has largely focused on the larger fisheries of the northern hemisphere, some of which fluctuate at decadal time scales and show patterns of synchrony with low frequency signals, as reflected by climatic indices such as the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, there is limited information on these patterns for the NW African coast, where important international fisheries have been established for decades. In order to improve {{our understanding of the}} impacts of climate variability (in particular the NAO) on <b>black</b> <b>hake</b> dynamics in northwest Africa, we used catch-based relative abundance indices from commercial fisheries off Mauritania and Senegal as dependent variables in correlation analyses with the NAO index. Then we tested the mechanistic dependence between the NAO index and north–south (v) component of the wind stress as a proxy of upwelling variability. <b>Black</b> <b>hake</b> abundance was highly and negatively correlated with the NAO index, with a time lag of 3 years. The NAO explained around 40 to 50 % of abundance variability between 1960 and 2003. At the same time, the wind stress fields were positively correlated with NAO during the same year, which was responsible for 53 % of their variability. In contrast to what we expected, these results suggest that <b>black</b> <b>hake</b> abundance is inversely related with intensified and extended upwelling processes along the Mauritanian and Senegalese coast, causing the cold oceanographic season to extend more southwards than normal.

40|$|Spawning {{ground of}} both hake species {{seems to be}} located southward Cape Timiris, during the cold season, {{avoiding}} the permanent upwelling off Cape Blanc. In spite of both species shared their distribution area and a depth belt (between 100 - 500 m), they were not caught in the same sampling stations regularly, which implies a not simultaneous spawning. The increasing of male’s proportion in the concentration’s zones of spawning females is a behavior already observed in some other hakes (Di Giacomo et al., 1993; Pájaro et al., 2005). M. senegalensis {{seems to have a}} spawning season more prolonged. However, because the wide distribution of M. polli the spawning ground could be extended southward, out of the study zone, where is just suggested a spawning area of this species (Garcia, 1982). The observed bathymetric in the mature specimens of both species are related to their habitats and do not hinder considering the <b>black</b> <b>hake</b> fishery as a single-species entity for stock assessment and management purposes. - 19 - 18 - 17 - 16 W 1...|$|E
40|$|The <b>black</b> <b>hakes,</b> Merluccius polli and M. senegalensis, are {{target species}} of a trawl Spanish fleet in Mauritanian waters. M. polli is a deep-water hake while M. senegalensis shows a {{shallower}} distribution. Both species are mixed in the landings, although the deeper hake totals a greater fraction (85 %) {{of the catch}} due to the fishing strategy of the trawl fleet. The female gonads of both hakes were collected during an experimental survey {{carried out in the}} Mauritanian EEZ. Mature ovaries were examined {{from the start of the}} reproductive season in this area. Ovaries were processed by a standard histological technique. Histological characteristics of ovarian tissues and oocyte stages were studied by light microscopy. The ovaries of <b>black</b> <b>hakes</b> showed various stages of oocyte development from the small sized, chromatin nuclear and perinucleolar oocytes, and the medium sized, cortical alveoli and vitellogenic oocytes. This last stage presents yolk granules occupying the cytoplasm at different levels. In the case of M. senegalensis, the presence of large sized oocytes with early migration of the nucleus to the animal pole, as well as fusion of oil droplets indicate maturation and imminent spawning, thus, indicating an earlier spawning than M. polli. Furthermore, postovulatory follicles observed in M. senegalensis indicate a recent batch spawning episode. This result is concordant with the values of GSI obtained for both species in these waters. The reproductive period extends from October to Mars with a defined peak in December - January for females of both hakes, although the shallower species, M. senegalensis, shows an earlier spawning in this study. Atretic stages were observed, but their incidence was low because the sampling corresponds to the beginning of the spawning period. The species are multiple batch spawners as suggested by their oocyte size frequency distribution in the ovary. The present study is a first approach to ovarian histology of M. polli and M. senegalensis, and intended to provide basic knowledge for further detailed studies on the reproductive biology of these species, essential for an adequate assessment of this stock.

40|$|There are {{two species}} of hakes {{distributed}} in waters off Mauritania, that {{are commonly known as}} <b>black</b> <b>hakes,</b> Merluccius senegalensis Cadenat, 1950 and Merluccius polli Cadenat, 1950. Both species overlaps their bathymetric distribution on the continental shelf and slope where they are fished by Spanish trawling and bottom longliner fleets, which implies mixed fishing statistics. During 2003 and 2004 there were conducted several scientific watching campaigns onboard of trawler ships as well as two experimental campaigns onboard in a longliner ship. Based on obtained data, in the present work there are analyzed general aspects of time-space variation of both species population. It is stated a dependence distribution on depth. M. senegalensis was found in poor quantities deeper than 500 m. The overlapping between both species took place from 150 to 500 m, and M. polli were caught by trawling in deepest waters, more than 900 m. M. polli was the predominant specie of the trawling fleet catches (88 % in weight) that fishing on deep waters, whereas M. senegalensis was the most abundant specie into the longliners fishing area, reaching 67 % of the catches. The specimens of both species increase in size with depth, being the average lengths of M. senegalensis larger than M. polli.

Spanish trawling and longliner fleets catch both species. During 2003 and 2004, 8101 and 2691 specimens of M. polli and M. senegalensis respectively were sampled biologically in several scientific watching campaigns onboard of commercial trawling ships and two longline experimental campaigns. From the information stored, {{it has been}} calculated the total length (cm) vs. total weight (g) and total length vs. total gutted weight relationships by sexes and species, {{as well as the}} conversion factor from gutted to total weight. By means of macrocospic analysis of the gonadic stages and the evolution of the gonadosomatic indexes (GSI) of both species it has been located the spawning season and zones. The spawning season extends mainly from November to February with a peak in December-January for both species, but with quite early in M. senegalensis. The males reaches the sexual maturity at lower lengths than females in both hake species (34, 3 - 39, 2 cm in M. polli and 33, 0 - 39, 2 cm;in M. senegalensis) and females of both species reaches at the same length the first maturity. For the combined sexes, M. senegalensis reach the firsts maturity at slightly lower length (35, 4 cm) than M. polli (37, 0 cm). Females dominate the sex ratio in the populations of both species.

40|$|PosterThe named <b>black</b> <b>hake</b> in the Northwest Africa, M. polli and M. senegalensis, are {{distributed}} in Saharan, Mauritanian and Senegalese waters, {{where they are}} target species of Spanish trawling fleet and by some longliners. The separation of both species is quite difficult in practice, hence they are usually considered as <b>black</b> <b>hake</b> (mixed) in commercial catch statistics. This fact and the considerable deep distribution range of M. polli, results in a marked scarcity of comparative detailed studies about these species. The aim of this work was to analyze detailed biological data, collected during research trawl surveys and scientific observations onboard of commercial trawlers and longilenrs in Mauritanian and Senegalese waters during 2003 - 2006. By macroscopic analysis of the gonadic stages and the seasonal evolution of gonadosomatic indices (GSI), it has been determined the spawning season of both species. In {{order to determine the}} size at first sexual maturity, a logistic model was fitted to the mature fraction by length separated by species, considering different time periods. In other hand, the monthly time series of commercial gonad yields between 1986 and 2006 were split up in the trend and the seasonal components using a X- 12 ARIMA routine. The spawning took place during the cold season, from November to February with the strongest signal during December-January for both species, but it occurs quite early in M. senegalensis. Males consistently maturing earlier than females, but there was a little length difference of sexual maturity for the two species. M. senegalensis reached the first maturity (35, 4 cm) at slightly lower length than M. polli (37, 0 cm) for combined sexes model. The sex ratio was skewed to females in both species. Because these species inhabits into a highly dynamic oceanographic area, and taking in account that recently it has been suggested a strong dependence between the climate-environment proxy NAO and the black hakes adult abundance dynamics, we explored possible deterministic relationships between reproduction features and sexual maturity of both species in phase with NAO index. It was not possible to determine if the difference in length-maturity values with some previous analyses were related with changes in abundance, the environmental forcing, or due to calculus procedures. However there was synchrony between the pronounced negative NAO phase and decreasing amplitude of seasonal peak of gonad yields for both species. Finally, despite of there was a slightly asynchrony in spawning timing among both species, we believe that in general terms it is justified to consider one set of maturity parameter values to perform the assessment procedures.

40|$|The {{presence}} of {{high concentrations of}} arsenic and copper was determined {{in most of the}} environmental matrixes under study (river water, river sediments, and soils), which suggests a real impact of the copper mining activity throughout the region, specifically the surroundings of the Caletones smelter, in the VI Region of Chile. The {{presence of}} arsenic in water and sediments is probably due to acid drainage, because pollution clearly diminished with increasing distance from the source. In the case of soils, they may be impacted by irrigation with river water. However, the high concentration values determined at sites far from the source suggest that soil pollution is more related to airborne particles deposited in soil. Arsenic speciation studies were carried out in river water samples and in edible tissues of fish (<b>black</b> kingclip, Chilean <b>hake</b> and croaker) and shellfish (clam, mussel and barnacle) samples, collected in the Pacific Ocean, close to the Cachapoal River outflow.
