5000|$|The <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> (Noturus miurus) {{is a small}} catfish of {{the family}} Ictaluridae that is native to the eastern United States.|$|E
5000|$|Brindled madtoms are {{approximately}} 10.1 to 12.6 cm long. The <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom,</b> like other Noturus species, has a caudally-fused adipose fin which {{extends from the}} caudal fin and runs nearly to the dorsal fin. The caudal fin spreads around the caudal peduncle, terminating {{just prior to the}} anal fin. The species has smooth skin without scales and possesses four pairs of barbels along the premaxilla and dentary. The <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> is laterally compressed along the caudal peduncle and has a dorsally compressed anterior from the pelvic fins to the jaw. The <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> is light brown, with dark dorsal splotches along the tip and two conspicuous saddle marks just behind the dorsal fin. The dorsal fin has a dark, spotted blotch on the tip and is located between the pectoral and pelvic fins.|$|E
5000|$|According to a 1982 {{study by}} Burr, the {{quantitative}} diet of the <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> was determined via dissection of stomach contents which [...] "… contained mostly dipteran larvae and pupae, ephemeropteran naiads, trichopteran larvae and adult isopods, …, chironomids and simuliids were most frequently eaten. Ephemeropteran larvae, including the genera Potamanthus and Stenonema, were second in frequency, and trichopteran larvae, primarily the genus Chematopsyche, were third in frequency. Among crustacea, Lirceus {{and a variety}} of copepods were next in importance in the diet. Worms, other microcrustaceans, other aquatic insects and fish and plant material made only small contributions to the total diet,". Predation upon adult brindled madtoms is primarily from upper trophic level aquatic predators such as the longnose gar. <b>Brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> egg clutches are a viable food source for multiple opportunistic species including crustaceans, insects, and other fishes. Although most other Noturus species occur primarily in riffles, the <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> occurs primarily in moderately silted pools with heavy texture and mild currents. The <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> thrives in clean, benthic regions of pools in swift streams and rivers that have moderate siltation over a cobble or heavily textured bottom. The species thrives in water with consistent temperatures around 25 to 27 C. Temperatures above 30 C are not well tolerated, and mass mortalities observed at temperatures above 33 C.|$|E
50|$|It {{takes one}} year for females {{and two years}} for males to mature sexually and nesting/reproduction extends from May to July, with {{regional}} variance according to water temperature. When reproduction begins, the mating pair guards their clutch of 50-100 eggs, which is usually deposited in a protective shelter with a very small opening such as under rocks or in bottles/cans that litter the waterways; and these shelters are layered with mud or silt by the parents. The <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> can produce multiple clutches per year and the average lifespan of the species is about 3 years, with most specimens being found in the 2 year old range. The selective nature of this species {{as it relates to}} reproduction habitat puts the reproductive fitness of the species as a whole, in jeopardy. Since this species prefers a substrate which has equal stone, cobble, sediment and texture which provides shelter and preferred nesting opportunities, even the slightest disturbance can drastically alter and distort the balance needed for fitness. The decrease in preferred habitat has contributed to the decline of various species of madtoms, leading to an inter-species breeding, specifically between the <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> and the tadpole madtom, which may lead to further chromosomal evolution within this species as identified by LeGrand's study.|$|E
40|$|A {{survey of}} the Poteau River {{produced}} 68 species of fishes, six of which are reported as new for the Poteau drainage: the pea-lipped redhorse (Moxostoma macrolepidotum), threadfin shad (Dorosoma petenense), white bass (Morone chrysops), redear sunfish (Lepomis microlophus), blue sucker (Cycleptus elongatus), and inland silversides (Menidia beryllina). Species previously collected from several places in the drainage, but absent from these collections, include blackside darter (Percina maculata), longnose darter (Percina nasuta), and <b>brindled</b> <b>madtom</b> (Noturus miurus). Including all species previously listed in the literature, {{the number of species}} presently known to occur in the Poteau and its tributaries is herein revised to 95...|$|E
