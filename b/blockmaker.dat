60|$|On {{the night}} of the 2nd March 1866, the {{premises}} of a <b>blockmaker</b> named George Milne caught fire. The flames spread with great rapidity, arousing Milne and his family, which consisted of his wife and seven children. All these sought refuge in the attics. At first Milne thought he could have saved himself, but with so many little children round him he found himself utterly helpless. Not far from the spot, Henry Douglas, a fire-escape conductor, sat in his sentry-box, reading a book, perchance, or meditating, mayhap, on the wife and little ones slumbering snugly at home, while he kept watch over the sleeping city. Soon the shout of fire reached his ears. At once his cloth-cap was exchanged for the black helmet, and, in a few seconds, the escape was flying along the streets, pushed by the willing hands of policemen and passers-by. The answer to the summons was very prompt on this occasion, but the fire was burning fiercely when Conductor Douglas arrived, and the whole of {{the lower part of the}} house was so enveloped in flames and smoke that the windows could not be seen at all. Douglas therefore pitched his escape, at a venture, on what he thought would bring him to the second-floor windows, and up he went amid the cheers of the on-lookers. Entering a window, he tried to search the room, (and the cheers were hushed while the excited multitude gazed and listened with breathless anxiety--for they knew that the man was in a position of imminent danger). In a few moments he re-appeared on the escape, half suffocated. He had heard screams in the room above, and at once threw up the fly-ladder, by which he ascended to the parapet below the attic rooms. Here he discovered Milne and his family grouped together in helpless despair. We may conceive the gush of hope that must have thrilled their breasts when Conductor Douglas leaped through the smoke into the midst of them; but we can neither describe nor conceive, (unless we have heard it in similar circumstances), the tone of the deafening cheers that greeted the brave man when he re-appeared on the ladders, and, (with the aid of a policeman named John Pead), bore the whole family, one by one, in safety to the ground! For this deed Conductor Douglas received the silver medal of the Society, and Pead, the policeman, received a written testimonial and a sovereign. Subsequently, in consequence of Conductor Douglas's serious illness,-- resulting from his efforts on this occasion--the Society voted him a gratuity of 5 pounds beyond his sick allowance to mark their strong approbation of his conduct. Now in this case it is obvious that but for the fire-escape, the <b>blockmaker</b> and his family must have perished.|$|E

Implementing from the studio’s common framework, The <b>Blockmaker,</b> the studio’s research explores the notion of what makes a housing block? Through data to design approach and parametric software thinking, the <b>Blockmaker</b> is a research software that allows one to generate multiple design solutions by transforming mass, reconfiguration of programs, accessibilities, porosity and generating options for façade and structure responsively to a climate condition. My research question speculates on a scenario where a housing block would be self-sufficient with solar energy. How would it look like? How would it performs for power generation {{and at the same}} time generate better housing qualities for views, daylight and terraces? Can it create better qualities for a dwelling? In this studio, we add one parameter to observe the changes in our design intervention. In my case, for a block to be self-sufficient with solar panels, a parameter of energy demands with solar panel surfaces would be a primary aspect to consider. However, to make a housing block, it requires multiple parameters of housing qualities to finalise an optimised design decision. The BlockmakerHousin...|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a new primer design strategy for PCR amplification of unknown targets {{that are related}} to multiply-aligned protein sequences. Each primer consists of a short 3 ' degenerate core region and a longer 5 ' consensus clamp region. Only 3 - 4 highly conserved amino acid residues are necessary for design of the core, which is stabilized by the clamp during annealing to template molecules. During later rounds of amplification, the non-degenerate clamp permits stable annealing to product molecules. We demonstrate the practical utility of this hybrid primer method by detection of diverse reverse transcriptase-like genes in a human genome, and by detection of C 5 DNA methyltransferase homologs in various plant DNAs. In each case, amplified products were sufficiently pure to be cloned without gel fractionation. This COnsensus-DEgenerate Hybrid Oligonucleotide Primer (CODEHOP) strategy has been implemented as a computer program that is accessible over the World Wide Web ([URL] and is directly linked from the <b>BlockMaker</b> multiple sequence alignment site for hybrid primer prediction beginning with a set of related protein sequences...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a new primer design strategy for PCR amplification of distantly related gene sequences based on consensus-degenerate hybrid oligonucleotide primers (CODEHOPs). An interactive program has been written to design CODEHOP PCR primers from conserved blocks of amino acids within multiply-aligned protein sequences. Each CODEHOP consists of a pool of related primers containing all possible nucleotide sequences encoding 3 – 4 highly conserved amino acids within a 3 ′ degenerate core. A longer 5 ′ non-degenerate clamp region contains the most probable nucleotide predicted for each flanking codon. CODEHOPs are used in PCR amplification to isolate distantly related sequences encoding the conserved amino acid sequence. The primer design software and the CODEHOP PCR strategy have been utilized for the identification and characterization of new gene orthologs and paralogs in different plant, animal and bacterial species. In addition, this approach {{has been successful in}} identifying new pathogen species.

50|$|Wapping's {{proximity}} to the river gave it a strong maritime character for centuries, well into the 20th century. It was inhabited by sailors, mastmakers, boat-builders, <b>blockmakers,</b> instrument-makers, victuallers and representatives {{of all the other}} trades that supported the seafarer. Wapping was also the site of 'Execution Dock', where pirates and other water-borne criminals faced execution by hanging from a gibbet constructed close to the low water mark.

40|$|Rigging blocks are {{absolutely}} {{essential to the}} operation of a large sailing vessel, yet little has been published on these vital pieces of hardware. This thesis examines and analyzes the rigging and gun tackle blocks found {{in association with the}} Swedish royal warship, Vasa, lost in Stockholm Harbor on its maiden voyage on 10 August 1628. It explores the typology, nomenclature, historical development, and the physical mechanics of block technology and its application aboard square-rigged ships from antiquity to the 17 th century. Vasa’s blocks are discussed in detail, focusing on form, distribution at the wreck site, and interpretations of certain identifiable groups of blocks and a suggested reconstruction of the use and placement of these blocks in the rig. The final section compares Vasa’s rigging and gun tackle blocks to other archaeological examples from the period and draws conclusions regarding the patterns of block design, manufacturing methods, and national rigging practices. This archaeological information is then combined with the limited historical sources available to deduce the nature of the working environment of the navy yard <b>blockmaker</b> and the broader social organizatio...|$|E

Plasmids, Antibodies, Cell Lines, and Transfections Plasmids are listed in Table S 1. UIF, UAP 56 /DDX 39 and NXF 1 antibodies were raised in rabbit (Eurogentec) using purified UIF- 6 His, DDX 39 - 6 His and NXF 1 96 - 372 - 6 His proteins expressed in E. coli. Mouse monoclonal THOC 5 F 6 D antibody {{was a gift from}} A. Whetton and A. Pierce, Manchester. Purchased mouse antibodies include SSRP 1 10 D 7, SPT 16 8 D 2 (Cambridge Biosciences), ALY 11 G 5 (REF), tubulin B- 5 - 1 - 2, FLAG M 2 (Sigma) and MYC 9 E 10 (Roche). Human inducible RNAi cell line construction was as follows. Various miRNA hairpins were cloned using the BLOCK-IT PolII miR RNAi/meGFP kit (Invitrogen). Efficiency of RNAi hairpins was first assayed by Western blotting. Sequences targeted by successful miRNA hairpins were as follows: REF# 5 (CCGATATTCAGGAACTCTTTG), UIF# 5 (GTAACTCAGAAACCACGATTA), UAP 56 # 2 (AGGAATATGAGCGCTTCTCTA), DDX 39 # 3 (TCGTGCGGAATAGGAGCTTCA), SSRP 1 # 2 + 5 (AGTGCATTACCTGTTCCTACA + TTTGCTCGTGGTACCACTACT). RNAi hairpins were then cloned as HindIII/NotI PCR fragments into pcDNA 5 -FRT/TO/His[3]. FLP-In T-REX 293 cells (Invitrogen) were transfected with a 6 : 4 ratio of pPGKFLPobpA[4] and pcDNA 5 -FRT/TO-RNAi plasmids. Cells were selected using Hygromycin (Sigma) and colonies expanded. miRNA expression was induced with 1 µg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). Growth Curves For each stable cell line, 1 x 10 6 cells were plated in 10 cm petri dishes in {{the presence or absence of}} 1 µg/ml tetracycline (Sigma). At two day intervals the cells were trypsinised before being resuspended in 5 ml of media. Cells were then counted using an improved Neubauer haemocytometer and the total number of cells per plate was determined.

500|$|One reform St Vincent did achieve was the {{introduction}} of block making machinery at the navy yard in Portsmouth. The machinery was designed by Marc Isambard Brunel and Samuel Bentham. By 1808 forty-five machines were turning out 130,000 pulley blocks per year. The innovation meant that only ten to thirty unskilled men were able to equal the output of 100 skilled <b>blockmakers</b> and the capital cost {{of the project was}} recovered in three years. The revolution of machinery enabled the Navy to become self-sufficient in regard to the production of the essential blocks. This self-sufficiency removed a great deal of corruption, from external contractors producing inferior goods that jeopardised sailors' lives, to the corruption that arose from poorly paid officials responsible for awarding contracts and the bribes that might ensue. The buildings that housed the Block Machinery remain to this day and make up part of the Historic Portsmouth Dockyard.|$|R
