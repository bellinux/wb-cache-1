After Harry unexpectedly returns alive from the graveyard battle with Voldemort, Crouch/Moody takes Harry <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> questions him about Voldemort and {{what happened in the}} graveyard, and reveals that he is working for Voldemort. He then prepares to kill Harry, but Dumbledore, McGonagall, and Snape stop him.

Moody takes a devastated Harry <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> to interrogate him about Lord Voldemort, where he inadvertently blows his cover when he asks Harry whether there were [...] "others" [...] in the graveyard - despite Harry never having mentioned a graveyard. Moody then reveals that he had submitted Harry's name to the Goblet of Fire, {{and that he had}} been guiding and manipulating Harry throughout the tournament to ensure that he would win, so Voldemort would take Harry's blood in order to return. Moody attempts to attack Harry, but Dumbledore, Severus Snape, and Minerva McGonagall intervene and subdue Moody. The teachers force Moody to drink Veritaserum, a truth-telling potion, which reveals that he is not really Moody, and that the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk. The false Moody's Polyjuice Potion wears off, and he is revealed as Barty Crouch Jr., a loyal Death Eater. Crouch Jr. is sent back to Azkaban, from which he had escaped.|$|E

They were drawn there by a distress signal being transmitted from the bunker. They look around at various alien artifacts that {{have been set up}} on display in glass cases. After touching one case, they are surrounded by soldiers who take them to see Henry van Statten, the owner of the collection. The Doctor talks to van Statten, while Rose tours the facility with a technician named Adam Mitchell. Van Statten wants the Doctor's opinion on the pride of his collection, which he calls the [...] "Metaltron" [...] and orders him locked into the vault with the specimen.

He then left the Armed Forces and was {{appointed}} the Ukrainian Communist Party's secretary for personnel matters. From 9 January 1950 until August 1951, he headed the Odessa region's Party committee.

Natalie Keener, {{a young and}} ambitious new hire, {{promotes}} {{a program designed to}} cut costs by conducting layoffs via videoconferencing. Ryan raises concerns that the program could be seen as detached and apathetic, arguing that Natalie knows nothing about the reality of the firing process or how to handle upset people. He then plays the role of a fired employee to demonstrate her inexperience. Ryan's boss assigns him to bring Natalie on his next round of terminations to show her the ropes.|$|R

During this scene, there is a voiceover of Ramsay explaining his reasons for eliminating the chef. If an eliminated chef has performed exceptionally well, Ramsay may allow that chef to keep their jacket as a token of their success up to that point, if he sees fit.|$|R

List's scientists detect Gordon's appearance in Milwaukee, as they have been scanning for his teleportation, which leaves a quantum entanglement signature. List, Bakshi and Mike travel to Milwaukee, while Coulson, Ward, Fitz, Hunter and Palamas follow in their quinjet.|$|R

He {{was a member of the}} Evangelical United Brethren Church.|$|R
60|$|Neither {{of these}} {{excellent}} public servants had told a lie in this. Some such conversations as those reported had passed;--but a man doesn't lie when he exaggerates an emphasis, or {{even when he}} gives by a tone a meaning to a man's words exactly opposite to that which another tone would convey. Or, if he does lie in doing so, {{he does not know}} that he lies. Mr. Rattler had gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> old <b>office</b> at the Treasury and Mr. Roby had been forced to content himself with the Secretaryship at the Admiralty. But, as the old Duke had said, they were close friends, and prepared to fight together any battle which might keep them in their present position.|$|R
60|$|They went out, {{locking the}} door of the theatre behind them; and Utterson, once more leaving the {{servants}} gathered about the fire in the hall, trudged <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> to read the two narratives in which this mystery was now to be explained.|$|E
60|$|Tavernake went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> After all, then, {{things were}} {{to come to a}} crisis a little earlier than he had thought.

6000|$|... "Well!" [...] cried Lapham, helplessly submitting. He {{took out}} his watch, and {{saw that he had}} forty minutes to catch the four o'clock train. He hurried <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> and put {{together}} some papers preparatory to going, and despatched a note by his boy to Mrs. Lapham saying that he was starting for New York, and did not know just when he should get back.|$|E

Then one of the workmen seemed to object to something another said, for Dick heard [...] "No; it must be tightened. It knocked last night." ...|$|R
5000|$|Ferapontov {{then goes}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work at <b>his</b> <b>office</b> {{and a large}} sum of money is soon {{deposited}} with him by the representative of a rich local count.

Revilla is currently under observation. According <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother's talent manager, Lolit Solis, Revilla had been suffering from depression. Last March 28, he went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work in <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> He {{said in an interview with}} Startalk (Philippine television show) that it was a [...] "simple, pure accident." ...|$|R
60|$|Four {{hours until}} he became public property! 'Solicitor's divorce suit!' A surly, dogged anger {{replaced}} that dead feeling within him. 'Damn them all!' he thought; 'I won't run away. I'll {{act as if}} nothing had happened.' And in the sweltering heat of Fleet Street and Ludgate Hill he walked all the way to his City Club, lunched, and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> He worked there stolidly throughout the afternoon.|$|E
60|$|And {{so it was}} settled, {{after much}} further argument, {{that they were all}} to sup at Mr. Merrill's house, Cynthia stoutly {{maintaining}} that she would not desert them. And then Mr. Merrill, having several times repeated the street and number, went, <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> There was much mysterious whispering between Ephraim and Jethro in the hotel parlor after dinner, while Cynthia was turning over the leaves of a magazine, and then Ephraim proposed going out to see the sights.|$|E
60|$|Crosbie, as he {{made his}} way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>office,</b> swore that he would not do the bidding of the countess. He would not trudge off into the city after her trinkets. But at five o'clock, when he left his office, he did go there. He apologised to himself by saying that he had nothing else to do, and bethought himself that at the present moment his lady mother-in-law's smiles might be more {{convenient}} than her frowns. So he went to Lambert's, on Ludgate Hill, and there learned that the bracelet had been sent down to Courcy Castle full two months since.|$|E
50|$|Over {{two years}} prior, on 30 September 2011, the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) {{transferred}} Thawin Pliansri {{from the office}} of Secretary General of the National Security Council (NSC) to the office of Prime Minister Advisor. Police General Wichian Photphosri, then Commissioner General of the Royal Thai Police (RTP), was appointed as the NSC Secretary General instead, and Police General Priewpan Damapong, elder brother of Thaksin's former wife Potjaman Shinawatra, was appointed as the new RTP Commissioner General. Thawin requested an administrative court to revoke the transfer. The Supreme Administrative Court delivered a final judgment on 7 March 2014 that the transfer was legal, but was unreasonable because it did not appear that Thawin had carried out his duties ineffectively or failed to abide by the policy of the government. The court ordered the OPM <b>to</b> transfer Thawin <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> former <b>office</b> within 45 days. The OPM announced the transfer on 28 April 2014, retroactive to 30 September 2011.|$|R
60|$|The real {{damage to}} life and {{property}} had been so slight and in such pronounced contrast to the prevailing terror, that {{half an hour later}} only a sense of the ludicrous remained with the greater masses of the people. Mr. Dumphy, like all practical, unimaginative men, was among the first <b>to</b> recover <b>his</b> presence of mind with the passing of the immediate danger. People took confidence when this great man, who had so much to lose, after sharply remanding his clerks and everybody else <b>back</b> <b>to</b> business, re-entered <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> He strode at once <b>to</b> <b>his</b> desk. But the envelope was gone! He looked hurriedly among his papers--on the floor--by the broken window--but in vain.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the early}} 2010s two mayors {{of the town}} were convicted in {{separate}} corruption cases.

Wu was subsequently sentenced to 14 years in prison, having been found guilty of exacting bribes in excess of NT$16 million from 81 different projects since 2005. Officials from the Control Yuan said the scope of Wu's activities was [...] "unprecedented" [...] and that [...] "virtually no construction projects in the town were untainted by corruption".|$|R
