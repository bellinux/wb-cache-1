25|$|Perhaps {{nothing in}} the {{exhibition}} exemplifies this better than Gottfried Helnwein's 'Mickey'. His portrait of Disney's favorite mouse occupies an entire wall of the gallery; rendered from an oblique angle, his jaunty, ingenuous visage looks somehow sneaky and suspicious. His <b>broad</b> <b>smile,</b> encasing a row of gleaming teeth, seems more a snarl or leer. This is Mickey as Mr. Hyde, his hidden other self now disturbingly revealed.|$|E
500|$|The Tramp happens by the shop, {{where the}} girl is {{arranging}} flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a blossom discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, {{he turns to the}} shop's window where he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a <b>broad</b> <b>smile.</b> The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee: [...] "I've made a conquest!" [...] Via pantomime through the glass, she kindly offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.|$|E
500|$|Greeley {{attended}} the convention {{as a substitute}} for a delegate from Oregon who was unable to attend. In Chicago, he promoted Bates but deemed his cause hopeless and felt that Seward would be nominated. In conversations with other delegates, he predicted that, if nominated, Seward could not carry crucial battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Greeley's estrangement from Seward was not widely known, giving the editor more credibility. Greeley (and Seward) biographer Glyndon G. Van Deusen noted that it is uncertain how great a part Greeley played in Seward's defeat by Lincoln—he had little success gaining delegates for Bates. [...] On the first two ballots, Seward led Lincoln, but on the second only by a small margin. [...] After the third ballot, on which Lincoln was nominated, Greeley was seen among the Oregon delegation, a <b>broad</b> <b>smile</b> on his face. According to Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, [...] "it is hard to imagine Lincoln letting Greeley's resentment smolder for years as Seward did".|$|E

2500|$|The Chan {{tradition}} ascribes {{the origins}} of Chan in India to the Flower Sermon, the earliest source for which comes from the 14th century. It is said that Gautama Buddha gathered his disciples one day for a Dharma talk. When they gathered together, the Buddha was completely silent and some speculated that perhaps the Buddha was tired or ill. The Buddha silently held up and twirled a flower and his eyes twinkled; several of his disciples tried to interpret what this meant, though {{none of them were}} correct. One of the Buddha's disciples, Mahākāśyapa, silently gazed at the flower and broke into a <b>broad</b> <b>smile.</b> The Buddha then acknowledged Mahākāśyapa's insight by saying the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|During the Chicago game, 1,000 {{students}} {{gathered at}} the Athens Theater in Ann Arbor where they listened to a play-by-play account of the game as it was transmitted by telegraph from Chicago. [...] Michigan gains were met with cheering. [...] When Widman's touchdown run was announced, [...] "It {{seemed as if the}} whole assembly was thrown into the air by a volcanic eruption. Men threw their hats and coats at one another and hugged and danced in the aisles for fully ten minutes." [...] After the game, the crowd marched through the streets to President James B. Angell's home. [...] President Angell greeted the crowd with a <b>broad</b> <b>smile</b> and said, [...] "I congratulate you on the success of the Michigan team in Chicago this afternoon. [...] It is a great victory, and we owe much to the men who have won the laurels of our victory from the brow of our sister institution of learning. [...] It has been said that I am opposed to the game, but I wish to say that I, too, used to play in college. [...] In those days, however, we played the Herschberger game, and used to kick the ball instead of the man. [...] It is a great termination of the fall campaign, and we are greatly indebted to those who have so actively participated in it." ...|$|E

60|$|How {{her heart}} swelled with joy and {{gratitude}} {{as she passed}} the barriers of Portsmouth, and how Susan's face wore its <b>broadest</b> <b>smiles,</b> may be easily conceived. Sitting forwards, however, and screened by her bonnet, those smiles were unseen.|$|R

60|$|There were <b>broad</b> <b>smiles</b> forthcoming, {{yet no one}} laughed. This {{was one of the}} {{thousands}} of strange human incidents that must be enacted in the building of the railroad. It might have been humorous, but it was big. It fixed the spirit and it foreshadowed events.|$|R

60|$|So {{we waited}} for Sebastian to advance a pawn. Meanwhile, I toyed with South African farming--not very successfully, I must admit. Nature did not design me for growing oats.

50|$|In general, {{commissioned}} portraits {{such as this}} rarely showed adults smiling {{until the}} late 18th century, though smiling is often seen in tronies and figures in genre painting.

6000|$|... 'Now let us walk,' muttered the lama, and to {{the click}} of his rosary they walked in silence mile upon mile. The lama as usual, was deep in meditation, but Kim's bright eyes were open wide. This <b>broad,</b> <b>smiling</b> river of life, he considered, was a vast {{improvement}} on the cramped and crowded Lahore streets.
