He observed the Trinity nuclear test from a B-29 Superfortress that also carried fellow Project Alberta members Harold Agnew and Deak Parsons.|$|E
5|$|Cain orders Nemesis {{to return}} to the {{helicopter}} so they can leave, but Nemesis turns on Cain and attacks the Umbrella troops. Nemesis is finally killed protecting Alice from an explosion, {{and the rest of the}} survivors seize the helicopter. They throw Cain from the helicopter to the ground to be eaten by zombies, including the now-turned Dr. Ashford. The survivors escape in the chopper as the nuclear bomb detonates over the City Hall, catching the chopper in the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> and forcing it to crash. Alice sacrifices herself to save Angela during the crash and is impaled on a metal pole, killing her.|$|E
25|$|The explosion's {{effect on}} the trees near the {{hypocentre}} of the explosion was replicated during atmospheric nuclear tests in the 1950s and 1960s, and {{was similar to the}} effects of the conventional Operation Blowdown. These effects are caused by the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> produced by large explosions. The trees directly below the explosion are stripped as the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> moves vertically downward, while trees farther away are knocked over because the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> is travelling closer to horizontal when it reaches them.|$|E
40|$|Adiabatic <b>blast</b> <b>waves,</b> {{which have}} a total energy {{injected}} from the center, E proportional-to t(q), and propagate through a preshock medium with a density P(E) proportional-to tau-omega, are described by a family to similarity solutions. Previous work has shown that adiabatic <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> with increasing or constant postshock entropy behind the shock front are susceptible to an oscillatory instability, caused by {{the difference between the}} nature of the forces on {{the two sides of the}} dense shell behind the shock front. This instability sets in if the dense postshock layer is sufficiently thin. In this paper we consider the stability of adiabatic <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> with a decreasing postshock entropy. Such <b>blast</b> <b>waves,</b> if they are decelerating, always have a region behind the shock front which is subject to convection. Some accelerating <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> also have such a region, depending on the values of q, omega, and gamma, where gamma is the adiabatic index. However, since the shock interface stabilizes dynamically induced perturbations, <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> become convectively unstable only if the convective zone is localized around the origin or a contact discontinuity far from the shock front. On the other hand, the contact discontinuity of accelerating <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> is subject to a strong Rayleigh-Taylor instability. The frequency spectra of the nonradial, normal modes of adiabatic <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> have been calculated. We discuss the implications of this work for two astrophysical interests, the instability of shocks propagating through supernova envelopes and the evolution of planetary nebulaeopen 373...|$|R
40|$|The {{characteristics}} and the scaling laws of isolated spherical <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> have been briefly reviewed. Both self-similar solutions and numerical solutions of isolated <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> are discussed. <b>Blast</b> profiles in the near-field (strong shock region) and the far-field (weak shock region) are examined. Particular attention {{is directed at}} the blast overpressure and shock propagating speed. Consideration is also given to the interaction of spherical <b>blast</b> <b>waves.</b> Test data for the propagation and interaction of spherical <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> emanating from explosives placed {{in the vicinity of}} a solid propellant stack are presented. These data are discussed with regard to the scaling laws concerning the decay of blast overpressure...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} find the {{conditions}} which determine whether X-Ray hot gas in galaxy groups (intragroup gas; IGG) is heated externally or internally, we investigate the evolution of <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> in galaxy groups growing on a hierarchical clustering scenario. We find that the <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> driven by quasars are confined in groups and heat the IGG internally at z � 1. However, at z � 1, they expel the IGG from groups; the expelled gas may fall back into the groups later as externally heated gas. Moreover, this may explain the observed low metal abundance of IGG. For <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> driven by strong starbursts, the shift of the fate of <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> occurs at z ∼ 3. On the other hand, although <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> driven by weak starbursts do not expel IGG from groups, the heating efficiency decreases at z � 3 because of radiative cooling. It will be useful to compare these results with XMM-Newton observations...|$|R

25|$|The open valve in the {{ventilation}} system allowed the huge <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> {{and possibly the}} fire and toxic smoke to enter the second and perhaps {{the third and fourth}} compartments as well. All of the 36 men in the command post located in the second compartment were immediately incapacitated by the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> and likely killed. One sailor's body was found embedded in the ceiling of the second compartment. Although the sub was at periscope depth with her radio antennas extended, no one in the command post was able to send a distress signal or press a single button that would initiate an emergency ballast tank blow and bring the submarine to the surface.|$|E

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{believed}} that multiwavelength afterglows of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) originate from relativistic <b>blast</b> <b>waves.</b> We here show that in such <b>blast</b> <b>waves,</b> a significant fraction of the energy of shock-accelerated protons would be lost due to pion production by interactions with afterglow photons. This could lead to long-term production of 10 ^ 16 [...] 10 ^ 18 eV neutrinos and sub-TeV γ-rays that accompany with usual afterglows, provided that the protons are accelerated to 10 ^ 19 eV in the <b>blast</b> <b>waves.</b> Comment: 10 pages, A&A accepte...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> in tunnels and enclosures is {{of general interest}} in several engineering fields (shelter design, etc.). <b>Blast</b> <b>waves</b> decay in amplitude and increase in length with distance from the detonation point. The knowledge of the behaviour of <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> inside tunnels and enclosures is not far developed. Experimental measurements have proven difficult to interpret because the instrument response is sensitive to location and orientation especially close to {{the centre of the}} detonation. There is a need to better understand and predict blast effects in tunnel systems...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the dynamics and afterglow light curves of gamma-ray burst (GRB) <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> that encounter various density structures (such as bumps, voids, or steps) {{in the surrounding}} ambient medium. We present and explain the characteristic response features that each type of density structures in the medium leaves on the forward shock (FS) and reverse shock (RS) dynamics, for <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> with either a long-lived or short-lived RS. We show that, when the ambient medium density drops, the <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> exhibit in some cases a period of an actual acceleration (even during their deceleration stage), due to adiabatic cooling of <b>blast</b> <b>waves.</b> Comparing numerical examples that have different shapes of bumps or voids, we propose a number of consistency tests that correct modeling of <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> needs to satisfy. Our model results successfully pass these tests. Employing a Lagrangian description of <b>blast</b> <b>waves,</b> we perform a sophisticated calculation of afterglow emission. We show that, {{as a response to}} density structures in the ambient medium, the RS light curves produce more significant variations than the FS light curves. Some observed features (such as re-brightenings, dips, or slow wiggles) can be more easily explained within the RS model. We also discuss on the origin of these different features imprinted on the FS and RS light curves. Comment: Accepted for publication in ApJ, 33 pages, 17 figure...|$|R
25|$|Within a {{considerable}} radius {{from the surface}} of the nuclear fireball, 0–3kilometers—largely depending on the explosion's height, yield and position of personnel—ducking and covering would offer negligible protection against the intense heat, blast and prompt ionizing radiation following a nuclear explosion. Beyond that range, however, many lives would be saved by following the simple advice, especially since at that range the main hazard is not from ionizing radiation but from blast injuries and sustaining thermal flash burns to unprotected skin. Furthermore, following the bright flash of light of the nuclear fireball, the explosion's <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> would take from first light, 7 to 10 seconds to reach a person standing 3km {{from the surface of}} the nuclear fireball, with the exact time of arrival being dependent on the speed of sound in air in their area. The time delay between the moment of an explosions flash and the arrival of the slower moving <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> is analogous to the commonly experienced time delay between the observation of a flash of lightning and the arrival of thunder during a lightning storm, thus at the distances that the advice would be most effective, there would be more than ample amounts of time to take the prompt countermeasure of 'duck and cover' against the blast's direct effects and flying debris. For very large explosions it can take 30 seconds or more, after the silent moment of flash, for a potentially dangerous <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> over-pressure to arrive at, or hit, your position.|$|E
25|$|The Wagtail missile was {{intended}} to be fitted with a guidance system that utilised an inertial navigation system and a terrain-following radar, which allowed the missile to be fired from and navigate at extremely low altitudes. The missile was equipped with small retrorockets that retarded the missile following release, allowing the launching aircraft the opportunity to escape the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> from the missile's warhead.|$|E
25|$|The {{force of}} the {{explosion}} was enormous. The size of the explosion created an intense dust storm as {{the forces of the}} high pressure <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> and the subsequent vacuum forces caused considerable damage in their own right.

40|$|The {{impurity}} {{effect of}} suspended liquid particles on the laser-induced gas breakdown was experimentally investigated in quiescent gas. The {{focus of this}} study is the investigation of the influence of the impurities on the shock wave structure as well as the low density distribution. A 532 nm Nd:YAG laser beam with an 188 mJ/pulse was focused on the chamber filled with suspended liquid particles 0. 9 ± 0. 63 μm in diameter. Several shock waves are generated by multiple gas breakdowns along the beam path in the breakdown with particles. Four types of shock wave structures can be observed: (1) the dual <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> with a similar shock radius, (2) the dual <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> with a large shock radius at the lower breakdown, (3) the dual <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> with a large shock radius at the upper breakdown, and (4) the triple <b>blast</b> <b>waves.</b> The independent <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> interact with each other and enhance the shock strength behind the shock front in the lateral direction. The triple <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> lead to the strongest shock wave in all cases. The shock wave front that propagates toward the opposite laser focal spot impinges on one another, and thereafter a transmitted shock wave (TSW) appears. The TSW interacts with the low density core called a kernel; the kernel then longitudinally expands quickly due to a Richtmyer-Meshkov-like instability. The laser-particle interaction causes an increase in the kernel volume which is approximately five times as large as that in the gas breakdown without particles. In addition, the laser-particle interaction can improve the laser energy efficiency...|$|R

Based on the blasting mechanism and on the analysis of signal characteristics, <b>blasting</b> <b>waves</b> are recognized and divided into three zones, namely, shock wave zone, stress wave zone, and gas-expanding zone. This paper studies the relationships between stress, strain, and time of every zone. The tensile and compressive stresses of stress wave are considered. After the blasting test, four cracks from the borehole center toward the minimum burden appear at the model surface. The relationship between <b>blasting</b> <b>wave</b> and concrete damage is analyzed...|$|R
25|$|Actual {{ignition}} {{of materials}} {{depends on how}} long the thermal pulse lasts and the thickness and moisture content of the target. Near ground zero where the energy flux exceeds 125 J/cm2, what can burn, will. Farther away, only the most easily ignited materials will flame. Incendiary effects are compounded by secondary fires started by the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> effects such as from upset stoves and furnaces.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{material}} damage caused by a nuclear air burst {{is caused by a}} combination of the high static overpressures and the blast winds. The long compression of the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> weakens structures, which are then torn apart by the blast winds.

In contrast, lead-free DDNP-based primers had standard deviations of the peak blast pressure of 8. 2 - 25. 0 %. Combined with smaller <b>blast</b> <b>waves,</b> these large variations in peak blast pressure led to delayed ignition and failure to fire in brief field tests...|$|R
30|$|When <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> {{pass from}} a solid into a {{gas-filled}} tissue interface, compressive stress is {{converted into a}} tension wave. Therefore, gas-filled organs, such as the lungs, gastrointestinal tract, and auditory system, are vulnerable to <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> [2, 3, 6, 7], among which, blast injuries to the lungs {{can be the most}} lethal during the initial phase [7 – 12].

25|$|For air bursts {{at or near}} sea-level, 50–60% of the explosion's energy {{goes into}} the <b>blast</b> <b>wave,</b> {{depending}} on the size and the yield of the bomb. As a general rule, the blast fraction is higher for low yield weapons. Furthermore, it decreases at high altitudes because there is less air mass to absorb radiation energy and convert it into blast. This effect is most important for altitudes above 30km, corresponding to less than 1 percent of sea-level air density.|$|E
25|$|To {{elucidate}} {{the effects on}} lying {{flat on the ground}} in attenuating a weapons blast, Miyoko Matsubara, one of the Hiroshima maidens, when recounting the bombing in an interview in 1999, said that she was outdoors and less than 1 mile from the hypocenter of the Little Boy bomb. Upon observing the nuclear weapons silent flash she quickly lay flat on the ground, while those who were standing directly next to her, and her other fellow students, had simply disappeared from her sight when the <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> arrived and blew them away.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Acceleration of high-energy hadrons in GRB <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> will be {{established}} if highenergy neutrinos are detected from GRBs.

25|$|The thermobaric device {{yields the}} {{equivalent}} of 44 tons of TNT using about seven tons of {{a new type of}} high explosive. Because of this, the bomb's blast and pressure wave have a similar effect to a small tactical nuclear weapon, although on a smaller scale. The bomb works by detonating in mid-air. Most damage is inflicted by a supersonic shockwave and extremely high temperatures. Thermobaric weapons differ from conventional explosive weapons in that they generate a longer, more sustained <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> with greater temperatures. In doing so, they produce more damage over a larger area than a conventional weapon of similar mass.|$|E
25|$|During the Cold War, {{the tunnels}} were adapted to provide {{protection}} against blast and heat flash from nearby atomic detonations. Blast traps {{were added to}} both pedestrian and vehicle entrances. The pedestrian blast traps were relatively simple, consisting of three blast walls overlapping by at least three-quarters of {{the width of the}} tunnel. A more elaborate approach had to be adopted for vehicle tunnels, where L-shaped entrances equipped with blast pockets were cut. The blast pockets were intended to absorb and reflect the <b>blast</b> <b>wave,</b> preventing it reaching far inside the tunnel complex. Gas locks were also installed to protect against contamination from the outside.|$|E

Despite not knowing the origin of the intense flash of light, she ordered her students to execute a duck and cover drill. Ms. Karbysheva, who herself did not duck and cover but remained standing, was seriously lacerated when the explosion's <b>blast</b> <b>wave</b> arrived, and window glass blew in, severing a tendon in one of her arms; however, not one of her students, who she ordered to hide under their desks, suffered a cut. A follow up study {{of the effects of the}} meteor airburst determined that the windows most prone to breaking when exposed to a blast overpressure are those of school buildings, which tend to be large in area.|$|E
30|$|The {{physical}} damage inflicted by <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> is called primary blast injury, and lungs {{are vulnerable to}} <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> [1]. <b>Blast</b> lung injuries (BLI) can be extremely critical during the super-acute phase, and hypotension {{is supposed to be}} the main cause of death (1), but its etiology has not been elucidated.

50|$|While {{modeling}} itself only gives estimations, research {{based on}} these estimations could give rise to amazing technology. For example, a human head and combat helmet were modeled under <b>blast</b> <b>waves,</b> and {{the results showed that}} the helmet did very little to stop blast-induced damage. With this information, a new type of combat helmet could be created that minimizes the damage that <b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> can cause. This technology could then also be applied to general armor, or even clothing (<b>blast</b> <b>waves</b> damage internal organs as well). This kind of advancement is only the beginning of TBI reduction. Methods such as genetic manipulation may also become available in the future that could increase the stress and strain thresholds for neurons, or perhaps methods for healing the brain altogether will be created based on the modeling done in the present.|$|R
