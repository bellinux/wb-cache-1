6000|$|The boy {{was slowly}} {{following}} his mother, {{with his head}} fallen. March overtook him, and he started nervously {{at the touch of}} a hand on his shoulder, and then looked gratefully up into the man's face. March tried to tell him what the crime of lese-majesty was, and he said: [...] "Oh, yes.

6000|$|... "Why," [...] said my friend, pausing, {{with more}} grave and {{important}} hesitation than I thanked him for, [...] "there {{is not much}} to be said against the manner. The style is terse and intelligible, Mr. Croftangry, very intelligible; and that I consider as the first point in every thing that {{is intended to be}} understood.

I'm not pestered any more {{with a desire to}} engage in rucuses, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be home by seven. You lock the door after me, Buck.

I danced with her the whole while nearly, and--and I took her brother home--Pshaw! He was drunk; and I--well, he had got drunk {{drinking}} {{with me at the}} ball. The wine didn't touch me, but it turned his head; and I took him home; he's a drunkard, anyway. She let us in when we got to their house, and that kind of made a tie between us. She pretended to think she was under obligations to me, and so I got to going to her house." ...|$|E

Where that young fellow in Youth's Encounter {{wanted to be a}} bishop and a soldier and everything---- Just like me, except Schoenstrom is different, from London, some ways!

60|$|He {{lifted the}} latch, and <b>I</b> entered; <b>but</b> when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the parlour where Mr. and Mrs. Linton were, I could not persuade myself to proceed.

6000|$|... "I'm too rotten with fever," [...] {{the mate}} grumbled. [...] "I'd die if I left. Remember, I tried it two years ago. It takes {{the cold weather}} {{to bring out the}} fever. I arrived in Sydney on my back. They had to take me to {{hospital}} in an ambulance. I got worse and worse. The doctors told me the only thing to do was to head back where I got the fever. If I did I might live a long time. If I hung on in Sydney it meant a quick finish. They packed me on board in another ambulance. And that's all I saw of Australia for my holiday. I don't want to stay in the Solomons. It's plain hell. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to,</b> or croak." ...|$|E
6000|$|THEY {{had four}} hours in New York between trains. The one thing Babbitt wished to {{see was the}} Pennsylvania Hotel, which had been built since his last visit.

Lord, their turnover must be--well, suppose price of rooms is four to eight dollars a day, and I suppose maybe some ten and--four times twenty-two hundred-say six times twenty-two hundred--well, anyway, with restaurants and everything, say summers between eight and fifteen thousand a day. Every day! I never thought I'd see a thing like that! Some town! Of course the average fellow in Zenith has got more Individual Initiative than the fourflushers here, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> hand it to New York.

60|$|When I {{left the}} National line to visit Flag-officer Foote I {{had no idea}} that there would be any {{engagement}} on land unless I brought it on myself. The conditions for battle were much more favorable to us than they had been for the first two days of the investment. From the 12th to the 14th we had but 15,000 men of all arms and no gunboats. Now we had been reinforced by a fleet of six naval vessels, a large division of troops under General L. Wallace and 2,500 men brought over from Fort Henry belonging to the division of C. F. Smith. The enemy, however, had taken the initiative. Just as I landed I met Captain Hillyer of my staff, white with fear, not for his personal safety, but {{for the safety of the}} National troops. He said the enemy had come out of his lines in full force and attacked and scattered McClernand's division, which was in full retreat. The roads, as I have said, were unfit for making fast time, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> my command as soon as possible. The attack had been made on the National right. I was some four or five miles north of our left. The line was about three miles long. In reaching the point where the disaster had occurred I had to pass the divisions of Smith and Wallace. I saw no sign of excitement on the portion of the line held by Smith; Wallace was nearer the scene of conflict and had taken part in it. He had, at an opportune time, sent Thayer's brigade to the support of McClernand and thereby contributed to hold the enemy within his lines.|$|E
6000|$|... "After a long time, {{we began}} to run more slowly. I put my head out and {{could see in the}} {{distance}} a ring of lights hanging in the blackness. I loosened the carriage door and waited for the train to run slower still; I didn't mean to go into Linz like a rat into a trap. At last I could wait no longer; I opened the door, jumped and fell into some bushes. I was not much hurt, but bruised, and the breath knocked out of me. As soon as I could, I crawled out. It was very dark. I felt heavy and sore, and for some time went stumbling in and out amongst trees. Presently I came to a clear space; on one side I could see the town's shape drawn in lighted lamps, and on the other a dark mass, which I think was forest; in the distance too was a thin chain of lights. I thought: 'They must be the lights of a bridge.' Just then the moon came out, and I could see the river shining below. It was cold and damp, and I walked quickly. At last I came out on a road, past houses and barking dogs, down to the river bank; there I sat against a shed and went to sleep. I woke very stiff. It was darker than before; the moon was gone. I could just see the river. I stumbled on, to get through the town before dawn. It was all black shapes-houses and sheds, and the smell of the river, the smell of rotting hay, apples, tar, mud, fish; and here and there on a wharf a lantern. I stumbled over casks and ropes and boxes; I saw I should never get clear--the dawn had begun already on the other side. Some men came from a house behind me. I bent, and crept behind some barrels. They passed along the wharf; they seemed to drop into the river. I heard one of them say: 'Passau before night.' I stood up and saw they had walked on board a steamer which was lying head up-stream, with some barges in tow. There was a plank laid to the steamer, and a lantern at the other end. I could hear the fellows moving below deck, getting up steam. I ran across the plank and crept {{to the end of the}} steamer. I meant to go with them to Passau! The rope which towed the barges was nearly taut; and I knew if I could get on to the barges I should be safe. I climbed down on this rope and crawled along. I was desperate, I knew they'd soon be coming up, and it was getting light. I thought I should fall into the water several times, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> the barge at last. It was laden with straw. There was nobody on board. I was hungry and thirsty--I looked for something to eat; there was nothing but the ashes of a fire and a man's coat. I crept into the straw. Soon a boat brought men, one for each barge, and there were sounds of steam. As soon as we began moving through the water, I fell asleep. When I woke we were creeping through a heavy mist. I made a little hole in the straw and saw the bargeman. He was sitting by a fire at the barge's edge, so that the sparks and smoke blew away over the water. He ate and drank with both hands, and funny enough he looked in the mist, like a big bird flapping its wings; there was a good smell of coffee, and I sneezed. How the fellow started! But presently he took a pitchfork and prodded the straw. Then I stood up. I couldn't help laughing, he was so surprised--a huge, dark man, with a great black beard. I pointed to the fire and said 'Give me some, brother!' He pulled me out of the straw; I was so stiff, I couldn't move. I sat by the fire, and ate black bread and turnips, and drank coffee; while he stood by, watching me and muttering. I couldn't understand him well--he spoke a dialect from Hungary. He asked me: How I got there--who I was--where I was from? I looked up in his face, and he looked down at me, sucking his pipe. He was a big man, he lived alone on the river, and I was tired of telling lies, so I told him the whole thing. When I had done he just grunted. I can see him now standing over me, with the mist hanging in his beard, and his great naked arms. He drew me some water, and I washed and showed him my wig and moustache, and threw them overboard. All that day we lay out on the barge in the mist, with our feet to the fire, smoking; now and then he would spit into the ashes and mutter into his beard. I shall never forget that day. The steamer was like a monster with fiery nostrils, and the other barges were dumb creatures with eyes, where the fires were; we couldn't see the bank, but now and then a bluff and high trees, or a castle, showed in the mist. If I had only had paint and canvas that day!" [...] He sighed.|$|E

Then I had some therapy myself and it really did make me re-evaluate what I wanted from life. I did a foundation year in counselling and knew I wanted to take it further. The crunch came when I was accepted onto a training course that would qualify me to be a therapist. On the same day I got a call back from an audition to be a regular in Holby City. When I didn't get the part I saw it as a sign that I had to give up acting altogether to do the 3 year course. I had to make a choice and I've never regretted it." ...|$|E
5000|$|She consoled {{herself with}} an {{appearance}} at the Good Luck Beijing China Athletics Open in the Bird's Nest Stadium - a pre-games test event. Although {{she had not been}} initially selected for the meeting, she received a special invitation to compete. However, she managed only twelfth place in the 5000 m: [...] "I wanted {{to take part in the}} Olympic Games, but I have no chance now. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> experience the Olympic atmosphere in advance, which gave me a little relief...I'm thankful that people still remember me.
