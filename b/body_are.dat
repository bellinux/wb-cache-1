5|$|Divers are aquatic birds {{the size}} of a large duck, to which they are unrelated. They swim well and fly {{adequately}} but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the <b>body,</b> <b>are</b> clumsy on land. They feed on fish and other aquatic animals.|$|E
5|$|Ethanol {{extracts}} of {{the fruit}} <b>body</b> <b>are</b> high in antioxidant activity, and have been shown in laboratory tests to have anti-inflammatory activity comparable to the drug diclofenac. Studies with mouse models have also demonstrated hepatoprotective (liver-protecting) ability, possibly by restoring diminished levels of the antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase and catalase caused by experimental exposure to the liver-damaging chemical carbon tetrachloride.|$|E
5|$|Loons are aquatic {{birds that}} are {{the size of a}} large duck, to which they are unrelated. Their plumage is largely gray or black, and they have spear-shaped bills. Loons swim well and fly adequately, but, because their legs are placed towards the rear of the <b>body,</b> <b>are</b> {{extremely}} poor at walking. Three species have been recorded in Maryland.|$|E

5|$|Chapter 7 {{discusses}} the fifth limb of yoga, Pratyahara, which {{it says is}} of five forms. This stage is one where {{the focus of the}} mind shifts from external stimuli received by sensory organs to various levels of internal awareness. The theory of Marma (joints) is presented, and 18 vital points inside one's <b>body</b> <b>are</b> listed that can be used as focal points to help initial stages of the meditative exercises.|$|E
5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and <b>body</b> <b>are</b> not identical because they have radically different properties.|$|E
25|$|The <b>body</b> <b>was</b> {{first put}} {{on display in}} the Eden Museum. Because it drew such large crowds city {{authorities}} insisted that the <b>body</b> <b>be</b> moved and closed the exhibit. The body then became part of a freak show in a Montreal circus. When the show went bankrupt the <b>body</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and left in a warehouse. In 1907, the <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found by a group of children. It was subsequently claimed by the University of Montreal for research purposes. The <b>body</b> <b>was</b> later mummified and put on display in a glass case.|$|R

5|$|From 1988 to 2012, the Gorkha-dominated hill {{areas of}} Darjeeling {{district}} {{were under the}} jurisdiction of the Darjeeling Gorkha Hill Council (DGHC). In 2012, the DGHC was replaced by the Gorkhaland Territorial Administration (GTA). The elected members of this <b>body</b> <b>are</b> authorised to manage certain affairs of the hills, including education, health and tourism. Law and order in Darjeeling town comes {{under the jurisdiction of}} the district police force, which is a part of the West Bengal Police; a Deputy Superintendent of Police oversees the town's security and law affairs.

5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the <b>body</b> <b>are</b> proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, they are unable to synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|In the holotype of C. casuarius, {{the sides}} and tail of the <b>body</b> <b>are</b> covered in scales of several types. Polygonal tuberculate scales, covered in small bumps, vary in size over the body. Conical limpet-like scales are only {{preserved}} on a fold of skin preserved {{on the back of}} the tibia, but which was probably from the bottom of the belly, rather than the leg. Separating the polygonal scales of C. casuarius are shieldlike scales, arranged close together in rows. Ossified tendons are present on all the vertebrae, except for those in the cervical region. On no vertebrae do the tendons extend below the transverse processes. Each tendon is flattened at its origin, and transversely ovoid in the central rod, ending at a rounded point.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>body</b> <b>was</b> found {{buried in}} a wooden coffin, wrapped in lead sheet. Despite the lead sheet being damaged at the foot end, the <b>body</b> <b>was</b> in a {{remarkable}} state of preservation. The <b>body</b> <b>was</b> wrapped in two shrouds, which are {{on display in the}} priory. Since the <b>body's</b> identity <b>was</b> unknown, he was dubbed [...] "St Bees Man".|$|R

50|$|The fungus fruit <b>body</b> <b>is</b> the spore-producing {{stage of}} the life cycle. Most fungi {{reproduce}} by spores and the fruit <b>bodies</b> <b>are</b> developed specifically for the production and dispersal of spores.

5|$|Motor {{systems are}} {{areas of the}} brain that are {{involved}} in initiating body movements, that is, in activating muscles. Except for the muscles that control the eye, which are driven by nuclei in the midbrain, all the voluntary muscles in the <b>body</b> <b>are</b> directly innervated by motor neurons in the spinal cord and hindbrain. Spinal motor neurons are controlled both by neural circuits intrinsic to the spinal cord, and by inputs that descend from the brain. The intrinsic spinal circuits implement many reflex responses, and contain pattern generators for rhythmic movements such as walking or swimming. The descending connections from the brain allow for more sophisticated control.|$|E
5|$|Myotis alcathoe is the {{smallest}} European Myotis species. The fur is brownish on the upperparts, with a reddish tone in old specimens, and a slightly paler gray-brown below. Younger animals may be completely gray-brown. The brown fur distinguishes adult M.alcathoe from other whiskered bats, but juveniles cannot be unambiguously identified {{on the basis of}} morphology. M.alcathoe is similar to Daubenton's bat (Myotis daubentonii) and M.emarginatus in color. On the upper side of the body, the hairs are 6 to 8mm long and have dark bases and brown tips. The hairs on the lower side of the <b>body</b> <b>are</b> only slightly paler at the tip than at the base.|$|E
