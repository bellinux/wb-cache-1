40|$|Neurofibromatosis is {{a common}} {{disorder}} that is inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion. It is now known that this disease occurs in two major forms: von Recklinghausen neurofibromatosis (VRNF), {{which used to be}} called `peripheral neurofibromatosis', typically presents with café-au-lait spots; and cutaneous neurofibromas. Many other manifestations of the disease are found, including skeletal deformities, central nervous-system tumours, hydrocephalus, and mental retardation or learning disabilities. The incidence of VRNF is 1 / 3000 live births, but 50 % of patients represent new mutations. <b>Bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> (BANF) is less common than VRNF but is important because of the associated tumours on the 8 th cranial nerve.

40|$|Neurofibromatosis 2 or <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> (NF 2) is {{a severe}} {{autosomal}} dominant disorder {{characterized by the}} development of multiple tumors of the nervous system, including meningiomas, gliomas, neurofibromas, ependymomas, and particularly acoustic neuromas. Polymorphic DNA markers have revealed frequent loss of one copy of chromosome 22 in the tumor types associated with NF 2. Family studies have demonstrated that the primary defect in NF 2 is linked to DNA markers on chromosome 22, suggesting that it involves inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. We have employed a combination of multipoint linkage analysis and examination of deletions in primary tumor specimens to precisely map the NF 2 locus between flanking polymorphic DNA markers on chromosome 22. The 13 -cM region bracketed by these markers corresponds to 13 % of the genetic length of the long arm of chromosome 22 and is expected to contain less than 5 x 10 (6) bp of DNA.

40|$|A {{molecular}} genetic approach employing polymorphic DNA markers {{has been}} used to investigate the role of chromosomal aberrations in meningioma, {{one of the most common}} tumors of the human nervous system. Comparison of the alleles detected by DNA markers in tumor DNA versus DNA from normal tissue revealed chromosomal alterations present in primary surgical specimens. In agreement with cytogenetic studies of cultured meningiomas, the most frequent alteration detected was loss of heterozygosity on chromosome 22. Forty of 51 patients were constitutionally heterozygous for at least one chromosome 22 DNA marker. Seventeen of the 40 constitutionally heterozygotic patients (43 %) displayed hemizygosity for the corresponding marker in their meningioma tumor tissues. Loss of heterozygosity was also detected at a significantly lower frequency for markers on several other autosomes. In view of the striking association between acoustic neuroma and meningioma in <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> and the discovery that acoustic neuromas display specific loss of genes on chromosome 22, we propose that a common mechanism involving chromosome 22 is operative in the development of both tumor types.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether occupational and other suggested brain tumour risk factors relate to the development of acoustic neuromas (AN) in men. Responses to interviews were compared for 86 AN patients and 86 neighbourhood controls. During the period 10 or more years before the year of diagnosis of the case. more cases than controls had a job involving exposure to extremely loud noise: noise exposure was determined by a blinded review of job histories and linkage to the National Occupational Hazards Survey data base (odds ratio (OR) = 2. 2, 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 1. 12, 4. 67). A dose-response analysis showed an increase in risk related to number of years of job exposure to extremely loud noise (P for trend = 0. 02) with an OR of 13. 2 (Cl = 2. 01. 86. 98) for exposure for 20 or more years during the period up to 10 years before diagnosis. We propose that the findings in this study which identify noise as a risk factor support the hypothesis that mechanical trauma may contribute to tumorigenesis. Six per cent of all primary central nervous system (CNS) neoplasms in both men and women are neuromas (also called neunrlemmomas or schwannomas); almost all of these arise in the eighth cranial nerve and are called acoustic neuromas (AN). These tumours arise from Schwann cells in the nerve sheath and are slow growing and histologically benign. These tumours can occur in association with either of two genetic syndromes, <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> <b>neurofibromatosis</b> (Seizinger et al., 1987) and von Recklinghausen's neurofibromatosis (Editorial, 1987) but only a small minority of AN patients have either of these disorders.

If this goal is successful, then treatment can also be offered for the remaining tumor. If hearing is not preserved at the initial treatment, then usually the second tumor, in the only-hearing ear, is just observed.

40|$|Summary: The {{development}} of cochlear implantation has al-lowed {{the majority of}} patients deafened after the {{development of}} language to regain significant auditory benefit. In a subset of patients, however, loss of hearing results from destruction of the cochlear nerves, rendering cochlear implantation ineffec-tive. The {{most common cause of}} bilateral destruction of the cochlear nerves is neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF 2). The hall-mark of this genetic disorder is the development of <b>bilateral</b> <b>acoustic</b> neuromas, the growth or removal of which causes deafness in most patients. Patients with NF 2 may benefit from direct stimulation of the cochlear nucleus. We describe the devel-opment, use, and results of the auditory brainstem implant (ABI), which is typically implanted via craniotomy at the time of tumor removal. Most patients with the implant have good appreciation of environmental sounds, but obtain more modest benefit with regard to speech perception.

Removal of a seven–amino acid conserved sequence within this domain results in a dominant-negative form of Merlin that is stably associated with the plasma membrane and causes overproliferation when expressed ectopically in the wing. In addition, we provide evidence that the COOH-terminal region of Merlin has a negative regulatory role, as has been shown for ERM proteins.
