Mauser offered a version of the MG 81 (rejected due to excessive weight and its belt-fed operation) while Krieghoff presented a rising-block prototype, which too was quickly dropped. A design credited to Rheinmetall-Borsigs Louis Stange of Sömmerda proved satisfactory and underwent military trials conducted by the GL/C E-6 test station at Tarnewitz in mid-1942. This early prototype, known under the factory designation Gerät 450 ("device 450") or Ausführung [...] "A" [...] ("type A"), was intended to be a pure sheet metal design, using pressed steel {{in the construction of the}} receiver, buttstock and corrugated handguard. The proposed system of operation was modeled on that used in World War I Lewis light machine gun, with a gas-operated turning bolt action geared to a spiral (clock-type) recoil spring.

Later, this was also observed in mammalian astrocytes.Wang and Macagno, in 1998, again recurring to Hirudo medicinalis mechanosensory neurons, performed and elegant experiment {{in order to try}} to answer the still remaining question: [...] "How does a cell recognize self and respond by not growing over or along itself?"The authors then proposed two general types of mechanisms: I) External signals: Sibling neurites display surface identifying molecular factors, unique to each cell, that are capable of homotypic binding and therefore repel sibling neurites, or II) Internal signals: synchronous cell activity, such as voltage, which is transmitted within the cell mediating a dynamic mechanism of sibling growth inhibition.Contrarily to the first hypothesis, the second would require the continuity and communication between all parts of the cell for self-avoidance to occur.So the experiment consisted of detaching one of the neurons dendrites and see how the remaining attached dendrites reacted towards the detached fragment, [...] "do they still avoid overlapping?"The result was that the detached branch would stop being recognized as [...] "self" [...] by the other branches of the neuronal, leading to dendrite overlap.The clear conclusion of the study was that continuity between all parts of the neuron is critical for self-avoidance to operate. The authors then suggest various mechanisms that require continuity and could function as recognition signal, and thus might be the responsible ones, such as [...] "electrical activity, active or passive, as well as the diffusion of cytoplasmic signals either passively or by fast axonal transport".In the late 1990s and <b>beyond,</b> <b>model</b> organisms started to be used in the studies and the molecular mechanisms of self-avoidance started to be unraveled. In 1999 Wu and Maniatis discovered a striking organization of a large family of human neural protocadherin cell adhesion genes which formed a gene cluster encoding 58 protocadherins. The members of the protocadherin gene cluster were compelling candidates to provide the molecular code required for the maintenance of the self/non-self discrimination that led to self-avoidance. It was later (2012) confirmed, by Lefebvre et al., in a study with amacrine cells and Purkinje cells of Mus musculus, that these proteins are expressed in different combinations in individual neurons, thus providing [...] "barcodes" [...] with that distinguish one neuron from another.|$|E

Laboratory {{natural selection}} can illuminate whether a pu-tative selective agent {{is capable of}} generating long-term, sustained changes in individual traits and suites of traits. Artificial selection is the essential tool for understanding the general evolvability of traits {{and the extent to}} which genetic correlations constrain evolution. We review the contexts in which each type of experiment seems capable of offering key insights into important evolutionary issues. We also discuss the-oretical and methodological considerations that play critical roles in designing selection experiments that are relevant to evolutionary patterns of trait variation. In particular, we focus on the critical role of selection intensity and the consequences of experiments with different intensities. While selection experiments are not practical in many cases, sophisticated selection experiments—designed with careful consideration of the theory of selection—should be taken <b>beyond</b> <b>model</b> organisms and used in well-chosen natural systems to understand natural patterns of variation...|$|E

40|$|Are Asian American college {{students}} "minorities"? Using {{a measure of}} statistical parity of a student body compared to a state's demographics, Asian Americans have often been excluded from minority student status because they are "overrepresented.

40|$|Broken {{ergodicity}} (BE) {{occurs in}} Fourier method numerical simulations of ideal, homogeneous, incompressible magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence. Although naive statistical theory predicts that Fourier coefficients of fluid velocity and magnetic field are zero-mean random variables, numerical simulations clearly show that low-wave-number coefficients have non-zero mean values {{that can be}} very large compared to the associated standard deviation. In other words, large-scale coherent structure (i. e., broken ergodicity) in homogeneous MHD turbulence can spontaneously grow out of random initial conditions. Eigenanalysis of the modal covariance matrices in the probability density functions of ideal statistical theory leads to a theoretical explanation of observed BE in homogeneous MHD turbulence. Since dissipation is minimal at the largest scales, BE is also relevant for resistive magnetofluids, as evidenced in numerical simulations. Here, we move <b>beyond</b> <b>model</b> magnetofluids confined by periodic boxes to examine BE in rotating magnetofluids in spherical domains using spherical harmonic expansions along with suitable boundary conditions. We present theoretical results for 3 -D and 2 -D spherical models and also present computational results from dynamical simulations of 2 -D MHD turbulence on a rotating spherical surface. MHD turbulence on a 2 -D sphere is affected by Coriolus forces, while MHD turbulence on a 2 -D plane is not, so that 2 -D spherical models are a useful (and simpler) intermediate stage on the path to understanding the much more complex 3 -D spherical case...|$|E
40|$|In eukaryotes, {{determination}} of the subcellular location of a novel protein encoded in genomic or transcriptomic data provides useful clues as to its possible function. However, experimental localization studies are expensive and time-consuming. As a result, accurate in silico prediction of subcellular localization from sequence data alone is an extremely important field of study in bioinformatics. This is especially so as genomic studies expand <b>beyond</b> <b>model</b> system organisms to encompass the full diversity of eukaryotes. Here we review {{some of the more}} commonly used programs for prediction of proteins that function in mitochondria, or mitochondrion-related organelles in diverse eukaryotic lineages and provide recommendations on how to apply these methods. Furthermore, we compare the predictive performance of these programs on a mixed set of mitochondrial and non-mitochondrial proteins. Although N-terminal targeting peptide prediction programs tend to have the highest accuracy, they cannot be effectively used for partial coding sequences derived from high-throughput expressed sequence tag surveys where data for the N-terminus of the encoded protein is often missing. Therefore methods that do not rely on the presence of an N-terminal targeting sequence alone are extremely useful, especially for expressed sequence tag data. The best strategy for classification of unknown proteins is to use multiple programs, incorporating a variety of prediction strategies, and closely examine the predictions with an understanding of how each of those programs will likely handle the data...|$|E

Results Although the policy impacts on biodiversity are different for different pressures, biomes and species groups, some general trends could be identified. An extension of current EU policies will act as a brake on current trends by slowing down the loss of biodiversity in many cases and in most biomes, but it will be capable of neither halting nor of reversing the loss. Liberalization has the effect of accelerating biodiversity loss across the board, with few exceptions. A coherent sustainability scenario is clearly the most effective at preserving biodiversity, but the variant tested here still does not halt losses in all cases. Main conclusions Current EU policies for protecting biodiversity appear to be insufficient to reverse ongoing losses. Coherent sustainability strategies are effective at conserving biodiversity, but in order to assess losses and then reverse them, measures would need to be introduced that extend beyond the steps tested in the ALARM sustainability scenario. © 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E
40|$|In many {{environmental}} {{and public health}} domains, heuristic methods of risk and decision analysis must be relied upon, either because problem structures are ambiguous, reliable data is lacking, or decisions are urgent. This introduces an additional source of uncertainty <b>beyond</b> <b>model</b> and measurement error – uncertainty stemming from relying on inexact inference rules. Here we identify and analyse heuristics used to prioritise risk objects, to discriminate between signal and noise, to weight evidence, to construct models, to extrapolate beyond datasets, and to make policy. Some of these heuristics are based on causal generalisations, yet can misfire when these relationships are presumed rather than tested (e. g. surrogates in clinical trials). Others are conventions designed to confer stability to decision analysis, yet which may introduce serious error when applied ritualistically (e. g. significance testing). Some heuristics {{can be traced back}} to formal justifications, but only subject to strong assumptions that are often violated in practical applications. Heuristic decision rules (e. g. feasibility rules) in principle act as surrogates for utility maximisation or distributional concerns, yet in practice may neglect costs and benefits, be based on arbitrary thresholds, and be prone to gaming. We highlight the problem of rule-entrenchment, where analytical choices that are in principle contestable are arbitrarily fixed in practice, masking uncertainty and potentially introducing bias. Strategies for making risk and decision analysis more rigorous include: formalising the assumptions and scope conditions under which heuristics should be applied; testing rather than presuming their underlying empirical or theoretical justifications; using sensitivity analysis, simulations, multiple bias analysis, and deductive systems of inference (e. g. directed acyclic graphs) to characterise rule uncertainty and refine heuristics; adopting “recovery schemes” to correct for known biases; and basing decision rules on clearly articulated values and evidence, rather than convention...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Physiological and ADME {{changes during}} {{pregnancy}} can significantly affect drug pharmacokinetics and may necessitate dose adjustment. Since it is logistically impossible to delineate {{the changes in}} PK of all drugs administered to pregnant women, alternative approaches that can generalize across drugs and predict drug disposition in pregnancy are highly-desirable. We developed and validated a novel PBPK model, which integrates gestational time-dependent changes in maternal physiology and hepatic CYP enzyme activities, preclinical and clinical data, to predict maternal pharmacokinetics of drugs cleared primarily by CYP 3 A (midazolam, nifedipine, indinavir), CYP 1 A 2 (theophylline), CYP 2 D 6 (metoprolol, paroxetine, dextromethorphan, clonidine), CYP 2 C 9 (phenytoin), and multiple CYP enzymes (glyburide, methadone). We showed that our PBPK model can quantitatively predict the disposition during pregnancy of drugs cleared via single and/or multiple CYP pathways, and allow generalization <b>beyond</b> <b>model</b> drugs studied (e. g. midazolam) to other drugs with well-characterized ADME characteristics (e. g. indinavir). Moreover, our PBPK approach allowed us to bridge knowledge gaps {{that are difficult to}} test through clinical studies, for example, discerning the site (hepatic, intestinal, or both) of CYP 3 A induction in pregnancy. The coupled maternal-fetal physiology imposes additional concerns for both efficacy and safety of treatment. Fetal exposure to drugs not only depends on maternal pharmacokinetics, but also depends on placental passage of drugs. In this research, the gestational time-dependent contribution of the placental efflux transporter, P-glycoprotein, to drug distribution into the fetus, was quantified with PET imaging in a physiologically relevant model, the pregnant macaque. Such knowledge can be incorporated into a comprehensive fetal model in the future to predict fetal exposure to drugs. Taken together, the presented modeling approach can identify drugs whose pharmacokinetics may be altered during pregnancy, guide rational PK study design, and support dose adjustment for pregnant women...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary: Tropical marine {{ecosystems}} in the Caribbean {{region are}} inextricably linked through {{the movement of}} pollutants, nutrients, diseases, and other stressors, which threaten to further degrade coral reef communities. The magnitude of change that is occurring within the region is considerable, and solutions will require investigating {{pros and cons of}} networks of marine protected areas (MPAs), cooperation of neighboring countries, improved understanding of how external stressors degrade local marine resources, and ameliorating those stressors. Connectivity can be broadly defined as the exchange of materials (e. g., nutrients and pollutants), organisms, and genes and can be divided into: 1) genetic or evolutionary connectivity that concerns the exchange of organisms and genes, 2) demographic connectivity, which is the exchange of individuals among local groups, and 3) oceanographic connectivity, which includes flow of materials and circulation patterns and variability that underpin much of all these exchanges. Presently, we understand little about connectivity at specific locations <b>beyond</b> <b>model</b> outputs, and yet we must manage MPAs with connectivity in mind. A key to successful MPA management is how to most effectively work with scientists to acquire the information managers need. Oceanography connectivity is poorly understood, and even less is known about the shape of the dispersal curve for most species. Dispersal kernels differ for various systems, species, and life histories and are likely highly variable in space and time. Furthermore, the implications of different dispersal kernels on population dynamics and management of species is unknown. However, small dispersal kernels are the norm - not the exception. Linking patterns of dispersal to management options is difficult given the present state of knowledge. The behavioral component of larval dispersal has a major impact on where larvae settle. Individual larval behavior and life history details are required to produce meaningful simulations of population connectivity. Biological inputs are critical determinants of dispersal outcomes beyond what can be gleaned from models of passive dispersal. There is considerable temporal and spatial variation to connectivity patterns. New models are increasingly being developed, but these must be validated to understand upstream-downstream neighborhoods, dispersal corridors, stepping stones, and source/sink dynamics. At present, models are mainly useful for providing generalities and generating hypotheses. Low-technology approaches such as drifter vials and oceanographic drogues are useful, affordable options for understanding local connectivity. The “silver bullet” approach to MPA design may not be possible for several reasons. Genetic connectivity studies reveal divergent population genetic structures despite similar larval life histories. Historical stochasticity in reproduction and/or recruitment likely has important, longlasting consequences on present day genetic structure. (PDF has 200 pages. ...|$|E
40|$|A summary, as if {{the reader}} mattered "La {{condition}} primordiale d une étymologie rigoureuse : l établissement du sens initial" Emile Benveniste (1938), Les Mages dans l Ancien Iran 					 There is this tendency to if ever challenged to refer to some original sense in a phrase. 	This sense may then be broken down to its main, undivided atomic building block; the word (and surely to even smaller elements). But the word is not logos, it is nomos; it is a name. It becomes logos. It becomes law. 	Now enters this tiny voice, so insistent what if that original sense has been wrongly perceived ? Worse, what {{if it is not}} ? Worst, what if it is less existant than a dream ? A lot of buildings may then be seen to be castles in the air; wonderful, till they fall. They do so every day, all those disasters brought to us by the rumours, mishaps we prefer to treat from a distance. They re so many, they will exhaust any serious listing. 	But what if I am wrong, and that the word actually carries that initial sense (Benveniste) ? In that case, my rather new-kindled interest in the history of vir virtú, vertu, aretē & dygd finds its easy justification (but my project was not from the outset one of taxonomy.) 	One {{does not have to be}} Socrate, Cratylus, Plato or Buddha to work with these questions. One cannot be, one has to do it by oneself. It may be tough in the start, but it becomes not just a necessity it is that serious it may also, curiously, become an art, and a beautiful, joyful one. 	This mémoire treats basic experience. It departs from an uneasiness : How come some works of arts just won t let go of me ? Could their tenacity be explained, not just by their being sublime (Longinus), but by their virtuosity ? What, then, is virtuosity ? 	I would have to do a re-reading : a reading of my readings. Three experiences decided, unanimously, inconsiderate, to be re-read by me : those with Madame de La Fayette (1678), Miles Davis (1958), and Georges Perec (1975). These re-readings of mine turned out to be readings of me; I followed some counsel, and looked into the dusty chamber of an hidden art, etymology. From there, I was sent to the very border of the Indo-European, into truly pre-historic mythos, a primordial sea of knowledge beyond the nostratic (a presumed substratum of language). I was, literally, sent back to Memory. (A mother of mine. Her name is Mnemosyne). What I found shook me, no, that s way too weak, and unprecise. I was clawed. ( [...] .) 	 	What I came close to, is what I am. Ever grateful to great readers and writers Kertesz, Balzac, Felman, Barthes, Bourdieu to mention just a handful I have to say that it is beyond paragate male dominance. Beyond Vir mensura and <b>beyond</b> <b>model</b> thinking, it is parasamgate even beyond that. It is virtuosity itself; the aesthetic, sensual legitimation of dominance. It is of Eros, so poorly understood (I speak for myself, of course). It is violent. 	I spoke of joyful. I will not take from the reader any pleasure, or throe, of reading this mémoire. Therefore I speak of other things, other ways to just about the same core. Like any writing, it beats about the bush : ça tourne autour du pot, as one extraordinarily astute reader told me dryly, over that table (merci). Now and then, I hope, the reader will nevertheless become aware of a strange thing; the pot is right here (right here, write now, cf. Calder 1982, on Burroughs). The reading is that pot, and the reading is magic (which means wonderful, and not understood). This is the writing of my reading. 	So, to resume. There are three main strata of perspective in this work. These angles treat basic experience. The first level is my wonderment towards the effect of art. I ask again, and again, how come (my rendez-vous with) certain fragments stay with me, stay in me and thus seem to have provoked a change of me ? The second level rises from such questioning : could the effect of art be adequately accounted for by my use of a word such as virtuosité ? I would then have to examine that word, thing and notion more closely, and that work takes up about forty percent of this mémoire, rooting up the *wir, vr, etc. The third level is hardly governed by will alone. It is the discovery of my lecture. 	I have come to look upon lecture as far more, and older, than reading. It is something I am born with, but haven t cultivated; I no longer can assume that any litterate person can do a lecture, nor that analphabetism per definition means a life deprived of possibilities. On the contrary, I am on the verge of discovering all the things that can be experienced through a stripping-down of conventional readings. For a great keyword it is, conventional. And what is reading (fr. lecture) ? The etymologist will remind us that the root-sense of that word has to do with collecting and gathering, so there is from the outset this element of choice to it. 	It s most interesting. 	This reading that I m writing, has brought me to Paris for a short semester (2005) and for a few days visit to Poland. In Oświęcim as in Paris I was so privileged, I could walk and walk around, taking pictures and notes fram dawn to dusk and let the History of Europe, and of the IndoEuropean seep into me. In that way I was allowed to combine a pélérinage, with the falcon of Robert Burton as a faithful travelmate, with the study of Georges Perecs W ou le souvenir d enfance. This drawn-out exercice has enabled me to do interpretations of my chosen art-objects in a scope, and to a degree that I could not have imagined from the outset. 	I bring no grand conclusions today. The reader will be able to surmise that this work has a strong flavor of exploration. In that sense it has just barely started. Let me then hasten to say that anyone really can take similar approaches, and explore those mythical limits between subject and object with their own heart as guide. 	I end this with what may be seen as the start. In this work, I have made a lecture. This is the name of that lecture: Madame de La Fayette, Miles Davis, Georges Perec : Virtuosité Lecture de l art, appropriation de la langue I do find it necessary to challenge the idea that reading is well taken care of and I do so, {{as if the}} reader mattered.
