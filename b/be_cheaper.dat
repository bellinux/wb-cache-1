5|$|Between 21 and 24 November 2011, 23 of the RAAF's F-111C and F-111Gs {{which had}} not been {{selected}} for preservation were buried at the Swanbank landfill site outside of Ipswich, Queensland. The RAAF had considered scrapping these aircraft, but concluded that it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to bury them. The remaining ex-RAAF F-111s will be placed on display.|$|E
5|$|Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene) {{and high}} test peroxide, a concentrated form of hydrogen peroxide. It was retired after only four launches {{in favour of}} using American Scout rockets, which the Ministry of Defence calculated to <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> than maintaining the Black Arrow programme.|$|E
5|$|In 1988 Oscar Arias, President of Costa Rica, {{contacted}} Louisville mayor Jerry Abramson {{to inquire}} about buying the bridge to dismantle it and reassemble in Costa Rica, as he believed it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to import the bridge than build a new one. At the time the city did not actually own the bridge, and the plan never went through.|$|E

5|$|The {{programme}} was cancelled {{on economic}} grounds, as the Ministry of Defence {{decided that it}} would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to use the American Scout rocket, which had a similar payload capacity, for future launches. Prior to the cancellation of Black Arrow, NASA had offered to launch British payloads for free; however, this offer was withdrawn following the decision to cancel Black Arrow.|$|E
5|$|Analysis {{of the two}} {{combat system}} {{proposals}} saw Signaal fall out of favour with the tender reviewers. This was primarily attributed to a cost-reducing re-design late in the process: the changes were not fully documented because of time constraints. Supporting documentation was further criticised by the reviewers for being vaguely worded and not using milspec terminology and standards. In addition, the system proposed by Rockwell appeared to have greater performance capabilities, and would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to implement.|$|E

5|$|In the 1850s, {{the student}} bodies of Rutgers College and the Seminary began to expand, {{overcrowding}} the space provided at the Queens Campus. The seminary professors realized that students renting rooms at boarding {{houses in the}} city were paying more for their housing than students at other seminaries—over double the costs of housing at New York City's Union Theological Seminary or at nearby Princeton Theological Seminary. The professors surmised that it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to build a seminary building that provided both student housing and instruction space.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and {{in a press conference}} {{outlined}} some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS estimated expenditure of $8 million, to decommission facilities and — on short notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals. If the estimates were correct, reasoning went, it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to run the zoos than to shut them down.|$|E
5|$|In the {{treatment}} of diabetic foot infections, linezolid appears to <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> and more effective than vancomycin. In a 2004 open-label study, it was as effective as ampicillin/sulbactam and Amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and far superior in patients with foot ulcers and no osteomyelitis, but with significantly higher rates of adverse effects. A 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials, however, found that linezolid treatment failed as often as other antibiotics, regardless of whether patients had osteomyelitis.|$|E

5|$|The Tupolev Tu-75 was a {{military}} transport variant of the Tu-4 bomber, as was a similar airliner, the Tu-70, both using a new, purpose-designed fuselage. The first Soviet military machine of this class, it was equipped with a rear fuselage loading ramp. It was not placed into production because the VVS decided it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to modify its existing Tu-4s for the transport mission and to use its existing Lisunov Li-2 and Ilyushin Il-12 transports.|$|E
5|$|Unlike fueled {{generating}} plants, {{the capacity}} factor {{is affected by}} several parameters, including the variability of the wind at the site {{and the size of}} the generator relative to the turbine's swept area. A small generator would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> and achieve a higher capacity factor but would produce less electric power (and thus less profit) in high winds. Conversely, a large generator would cost more but generate little extra power and, depending on the type, may stall out at low wind speed. Thus an optimum capacity factor of around 40–50% would be aimed for.|$|E
5|$|Despite the World War I, {{significant}} {{extensions of}} rail lines were carried out, {{particularly in the}} wheat growing areas in the north west and west. The new lengthy parallel lines were considered to <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to operate than the numerous short spurs {{such as those in}} the Goulburn Valley. By 1930 the railway map of Victoria was largely complete, with the best land settled and the remaining land marginal for agriculture, with a number of lines built across the state border into the Riverina of NSW. On November 1937 the first run of the Spirit of Progress was made, a streamlined all air conditioned train run between Melbourne and Albury, led by the matching S class steam locomotives.|$|E

5|$|Maintenance of the Australian Globemasters is {{undertaken}} {{by both the}} RAAF and Boeing. As part of Australia's membership of the Globemaster III Sustainment Partnership, Air Force technicians are responsible for routine servicing, and Boeing handles major maintenance tasks. Boeing also provides technical support for RAAF Globemasters during deployments outside of Australia, {{and the company is}} paid in return for achieving contractually mandated aircraft availability targets. Due to the economies of scale arising from a large international maintenance program, the contract with Boeing is considered to <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> than attempting to support the aircraft through unique Australian contracts. It is expected that the RAAF's Globemasters will remain in service for 30 years.|$|E
5|$|On 20 October 1871 two {{engineers}} traversed the {{two possible}} routes from Bergen to Voss; the one via Fana, Os and Hardangerfjord, the other via Dale and Sørfjord. Though covering a less populated area, the latter would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to build, and have less elevation. A railway committee was created on 25 January 1872 {{with a limited}} mandate, which was increased again 20 December. At {{the same time there}} was a dispute between the Ministry of Labour and Pihl about whether to prioritize the Bergen Line, but in July 1872 surveys were performed in person by Pihl and two engineers, and their report was positive. At the same time he launched the idea of a branch line up Valdres to Lærdal.|$|E
5|$|The F-22 {{cannot be}} {{exported}} under American federal law {{to protect its}} stealth technology and other high-tech features.

In September 2006, Congress upheld the ban on foreign F-22 sales. Despite the ban, the 2010 defense authorization bill included provisions requiring the DoD to prepare {{a report on the}} costs and feasibility for an F-22 export variant, and another report on the effect of F-22 export sales on U.S. aerospace industry.|$|E

5|$|The {{bridge was}} first {{proposed}} {{as part of}} the Cambrian Line between Aberystwyth and Pwllheli by the Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway around 1861-2. It was designed by Benjamin Piercy and Henry Conybeare in 1864, and opened on 10 October 1867. Conybeare decided to construct the viaduct from timber as it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to import by sea than iron. As built, it included a wooden lifting drawbridge section at the northern end to permit the passage of tall ships. It was never in regular use since the opening of the railway killed off competition from boat traffic. In 1899, the drawbridge arrangement was changed to the current swing bridge arrangement. It is still theoretically in operation, though it has not been opened since 1987 as part of a test operation.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the first}} {{questions}} considered by the new Legislative Assembly of Alberta was the choice of provincial capital. The terms of autonomy had made Edmonton the provisional capital, {{but there was a}} movement to make Calgary the permanent choice. This movement was led in the legislature by Minister of Public Works William Henry Cushing, Cross's cabinet colleague, who argued that it would <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to build a legislature building in Calgary than in Edmonton and that Calgary was the economic centre of the province and therefore ought to be capital. Cross countered that Edmonton's history as capital of the Canadian fur trade and its geographic location close to the centre of the province gave it the stronger claim. Edmonton was eventually selected by a vote of 16 to 8. It would not be the last issue on which Cross and Cushing disagreed.|$|E
5|$|Several of the Victor B.2s {{had been}} {{converted}} for Strategic Reconnaissance missions following the retirement of the Valiant in this capacity. In service, this type was primarily used in surveillance of the Atlantic and Mediterranean Seas, capable of surveying 400,000 square miles in an eight-hour mission; they were also used to sample the fallout from French nuclear tests conducted in the South Pacific. Originally reconnaissance Victors were equipped for visual reconnaissance; however, it was found to <b>be</b> <b>cheaper</b> to assign Canberra light bombers to this duty and as such the cameras were removed in 1970. Subsequently, radar-based reconnaissance was emphasised in the type's role. The reconnaissance Victors remained in use until 1974 when they followed the standard bombers into the tanker conversion line; a handful of modified Avro Vulcans assumed the maritime radar reconnaissance role in their place.|$|E
