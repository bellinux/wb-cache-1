25|$|Over {{the next}} few seasons, Johnson played regular county cricket for Somerset, averaging, after a poor 1922, in the 20s, and {{making a lot of}} catches in the slips.

No further raids were conducted until 661, when the new Umayyad dynasty under Mu'awiya ushered in a new era of Muslim expansion. An official campaign to conquer North Africa began in 663, and the Arabs soon controlled most major cities in Libya. Tripoli fell again in 666 AD, and this time the Muslims ensured their control of their new lands by not immediately retreating to Egypt after the conquest.|$|E

Gen. K.A. Meretskov of Volkhov Front wrote: The new offensive was launched by 54th Army on Jan. 4, 1942 when it once again attacked I Corps, to the west of Kirishi. Forty-eight hours of heavy fighting produced an advance of only 4 – 5km, after which a counterattack by 12th Panzer Division drove Fedyuninsky's troops back to their starting line. The attack was renewed on Jan. 13 and the village of Pogoste was taken on the 17th, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> limit of success.|$|E
25|$|In 1924, as a {{postgraduate}} student with more time, Frazer finally played first-class cricket for Oxford University. He played {{in most of}} the team matches in the 1924 season, batting mainly in the middle order, but his best score and his only total ever of more than 50 was made as an opening batsman, with 81 in the match against H. D. G. Leveson-Gower's XI at Eastbourne, a rather weak team composed entirely of amateurs, many of them not in the first flush of youth (Ernest Smith, the captain, was 54 and had played for Oxford University 36 years earlier in 1888). Frazer's timing for a big innings was immaculate: the next Oxford game was the University Match and he duly won a cricket blue to go with his two soccer blues, scoring 5 and 20 in his two innings in a nine-wicket defeat by Cambridge. Frazer played seven further matches for Sussex when the university term was over, without success, and appeared for two amateur teams in first-class matches against Oxford University in 1925, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> end of his first-class cricket career.|$|E
25|$|In Somerset's batting innings, Woodcock {{suggested}} that the team needed just one top-class performance to grant them victory after restricting Kent's score well late in their innings. Peter Robinson, opening with Roy Virgin, played well to score 48 runs, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> highest score that any Somerset player would manage. Each of the other top-order batsmen made starts, but none could convert them to big scores; Virgin got 17, Mervyn Kitchen 15 and Terry Barwell 24. Alley, identified as a key player for Somerset before the match, only scored one run before being caught behind square on the legside by Brown from the bowling of Shepherd. Graham Burgess provided some runs in the middle-order, but lacked support from his batting partners; of the five batsmen who were below him in the batting order, only Geoff Clayton added more than two runs to the score, and he only totalled eight. Derek Underwood finished as Kent's leading wicket-taker in the match, though his three wickets came late in the innings, {{as he had been}} held back against the top-order, as Cowdrey was concerned he might concede too many runs. Somerset were all out for 161 runs, with 54.5 overs bowled, giving Kent a 32-run victory.|$|E

25|$|In February the British {{government}} {{planned to}} send 1,100 reinforcements by mid-May but financial wrangling between the War Office and the Colonial Office delayed {{the arrival of}} an infantry battalion until 15 May and a second battalion until 12 July. The French in Djibouti were asked to block the Jirreh and Dobo passes but the British strategy was to hope that the effort of invading British Somaliland would act as a deterrent and that Djibouti {{would be a more}} tempting target. When the French in French Somaliland rallied to Vichy after the French armistice of 22 June 1940 with Germany, The Officer Commanding, Troops in British Somaliland, Brigadier Arthur Reginald Chater RM, was ordered to make a contingency plan for an evacuation if the colony became untenable. By August, the garrison consisted of the 1st Battalion Northern Rhodesia Regiment (1st NRR), the 2nd (Nyasaland) Battalion KAR, the 1st East African Light Battery (4 × 3.7-inch howitzers) from Kenya, the 1st Battalion 2nd Punjab Regiment and the 3rd Battalion 15th Punjab Regiment from the Colony of Aden and the lightly armed Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) including 37 officer and NCO reinforcements from the Southern Rhodesia Regiment. On 8 August the 2nd Battalion Black Watch arrived. The garrison was a motley group with no proper base or headquarters and was short of artillery, transport and signalling equipment. Aircraft had to fly from Aden while also busy with convoy patrols and air defence. Two anti-aircraft guns were sent over from Aden <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most that could be spared.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals' next three-game {{series against}} the Los Angeles Dodgers {{followed}} the same pattern, with the Dodgers shutting out the Nationals 7−0 in the September 15 game behind a dominant turn by starting pitcher Alex Wood and then winning the September 16 game before the Nationals captured the last game of the set on September 17. In the latter game, Strasburg's streak of innings without allowing a run ended at 35 as a flyball by Logan Forsythe bounced off the heel of the center fielder Taylor's glove for what was ruled an RBI double in the second inning, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> only run the Nationals gave up as Strasburg earned the 7−1 win, buoyed by a two-homer performance by Zimmerman to equal the first baseman's career best in a season with 33 home runs. Embarking on their last road trip of the season, the Nationals won back-to-back games {{for the first time}} since clinching as they topped the Braves at SunTrust Park 4−2 behind a strong seven-inning start from Scherzer, as the Nationals ace became just the fourth pitcher in major league history to post four consecutive seasons with 250 or more strikeouts. In the game, Turner swiped two bases to set a new Nationals record for stolen bases in a season with 42. The Nationals ultimately took two of three from the Braves, dropping the last game of the series on September 21, although the veteran Zimmerman set a new personal best for a single season in home runs as he hit his 34th off Atlanta starter R.

Speaking about her character's exit storyline, Anderson said [...] "When I read the final script for Charlie's exit, I made sure I was in the privacy of my own home. It was written really well – it was a tragic love story and I hope the fans like it." [...] The actress explained that the storyline was great and the writers had done a brilliant job with Charlie and Brax. She also said some fans would be disappointed that the couple did not end up together. Anderson revealed that the series producer had told her that after investing so much in getting Charlie together with Brax, she would not have left the Bay for another reason and killing her off was the best way. Of her reaction to the storyline, Anderson said [...] "I started sobbing! <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> initial shock.

Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly mostly praised the short films competing against [...] "Angry Dad" [...] calling them [...] "the truly amusing stuff" [...] and adding that Condiments was a [...] "very accomplished replication of Pixar". However, he was critical of the guest stars, noting that, [...] "None of them were very funny, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> joke — they were parodying the toadying tone of awards patter. Well, Brand and Berry were; Gervais seemed to have improvised a lot of Gervais-y stream-of-jokiness blather that he may well have intended to be funny". Aly Semigran of MTV praised the episode for its animation parodies, writing, [...] "Sure, Toy Story and Wallace and Gromit might enjoy more Oscar love than their animated brethren, but The Simpsons send-ups were nothing if not a brilliant tip-of-the-hat to all of those films".|$|E
500|$|While sailing to Shanghai Matsui {{adopted a}} plan {{drawn by the}} Japanese Navy to divide the SEA between two landing sites north of Shanghai, Wusong and Chuanshakou, and then use the former force to attack Shanghai {{directly}} and the latter force to encircle the Chinese Army. On August 23 Matsui oversaw the landing operation from aboard his flagship the Yura. The initial landings went well, but increasingly intense fighting ensued on land and casualties mounted. Matsui had never believed {{that he had been}} given enough soldiers to handle the job and was continuously pressing the high command for more reinforcements. He himself was not able to go ashore in Shanghai until September 10, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> same day on which the Army General Staff informed him that three additional divisions would be deployed under his command. Still, even this infusion of new troops proved insufficient to dislodge the Chinese.

In fact the SEA was still battering [...] Chinese defensive lines at Nanxiang and Suzhou Creek at that point.
