40|$|Modification on the <b>liner</b> <b>bearing</b> {{was one of}} {{the ways}} to achieve {{sufficient}} lubricant on a journal bearing system. Efforts had shown that the ability to retain some lubricant by introducing wave like grooves on the liner has improved the performance of the bearings. However, the database for the modifications is still lacking. This study aims to establish and correlate modifications of the liner with the performance of the journal bearing. Numerical and experimental work were done to compare and relate several geometries of <b>liner</b> <b>bearing</b> modifications based on previous studies as well as new ones. The previously studied sine wave <b>liner</b> <b>bearing</b> involved investigations with the square and semi circular <b>liners.</b> Plain <b>liner</b> <b>bearing</b> was used as reference. All cases were investigated experimentally by a test rig under low operating loads of 30 N to 450 N with high speed conditions of 1200 RPM to 2800 RPM. Some of the parameters were validated in order to compare the numerical and experimental data. Case studies also included engine oil and palm olein as the lubricants. The performance of the bearings was analyzed by examining the side flow rates, lubricant temperature change, eccentricity ratio, and pressure distributions. The results show that, modifying the shape <b>liner</b> <b>bearing</b> under all operating conditions could increase the lubricant flow rate which was approximately 1. 5 times than the plain <b>liner</b> <b>bearing</b> and reduce the lubricant temperature change by about 35 %. The bearings with the wave shape liner led to the eccentricity ratio increase but within the acceptable range of 0. 6 to 0. 9.

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} a numerical model {{for evaluating the}} variation of friction and wear of a self lubricating <b>bearing</b> <b>liner</b> over its useful wear life. Self-lubricating bearings have been in widespread use since the mid- 1950 s, particularly in the aerospace industry where they {{have the advantage of}} being low maintenance components. They are commonly used in relatively low speed, reciprocating applications such as control surface actuators, and usually consist of a spherical bearing with the inner and outer elements separated by a composite textile resinbonded liner. A finite element model has been developed to predict the local stiffness of a particular liner at different states of wear. Results obtained using the model were used to predict the overall friction coefficient as it evolves due to wear, which is a novel approach. Experimental testing was performed on a bespoke flat-on-flat wear test rig with a reciprocating motion to validate the results of the friction model. These tests were carried out on a commercially-available <b>bearing</b> <b>liner,</b> predominantly at a high contact pressure and an average sliding speed of 0. 2 ms- 1. Good agreement between predicted and experimentally measured wear was obtained when appropriate coefficients of friction were used in the friction model, and when the reciprocating sliding distance was above a critical value. A numerical wear model was also developed to predict the trend of backlash development in real bearing geometries using a novel approach. Results from the wear model were validated against full-scale bearing tests carried out elsewhere by the sponsoring company. Good agreement was obtained between the model predictions and the experimental results for the first 80...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to study the {{performance}} of a finite length journal bearing, taking into account effects of non-Newtonian Rabinowitsch flow rheology and elastic deformations of the <b>bearing</b> <b>liner.</b> According to the Rabinowitsch fluid model, the cubic-stress constitutive equation is used to account for the non-Newtonian effects of pseudoplastic and dilatant lubricants. Integrating the continuity equation across the film, the nonlinear non-Newtonian Reynolds-type equation is derived. The elasticity part of the problem is solved on the base of Vlassov model of an elastic foundation. The numerical solution of the modified Reynolds equation is carried out by using FDM with over-relaxation technique. The results for steady state bearing performance characteristics have been calculated for various values of nonlinear factor and elasticity parameters. It was concluded that in comparison with the Newtonian lubricants, higher values of film pressure and load carrying capacity have been obtained for dilatant lubricants, while the case was reversed for pseudoplastic lubricants...|$|E

Due to their high importance the components located within such systems are marked as critical parts and therefore the monitoring of their current health state is of great value. The <b>bearing</b> <b>liner</b> which provides the sliding surface between inner and outer races is a Polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) and glass fibre woven composite. Low friction coefficients are achieved via the deposition of PTFE third-body particles, which occupy the valley-features at the roughness scale on the non-conformal sliding surfaces. As these third-bodies form, the woven matrix composite surface layers containing PTFE are consumed {{up to a point}} where only the structural reinforcing glass fibres are present, resulting in a higher coefficient of friction and accelerating the wear process. A cylinder-on-flat oscillating wear test bench developed within Cardiff University allowed for the gathering of physical data including temperature and Acoustic Emission (AE) signals during an accelerated wear test of the liner material. A radial load of 2. 5 kN and oscillation frequency of 5 Hz were applied to replicate typical operating conditions within a pitch control system.

Detailed experimental investigations of the tribological and mechanical characteristics of these materials has been completed. The thesis culminates with the identification of two possible materials that have the potential for direct injection moulding of a <b>bearing</b> <b>liner.</b> 1. Developing an Injection moulding process A thorough understanding of the capability of injection moulding PEEK composites was achieved through experimental investigation. Knowledge of the impact of varying injection moulding parameters on the final material was identified. 2. Friction and wear testing A bespoke test rig, in line with aerospace standards, was developed to allow the investigation of composite materials. Testing was conducted at room and high temperatures. A full analysis {{of the impact of the}} selected bulk material, short fibres and fillers was completed. Key parameters such as coefficient of friction, wear and fatigue life were identified.

40|$|The most {{sensitive}} {{component in the}} propulsion shafting system is the aft stern tube bearing, which is exposed to heavy static and dynamic propeller loads exerted to the bearing surface by the propeller shaft. The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering and Naval Architecture, University of Zagreb, and the American Bureau of Shipping intend {{to work on the}} development of the theoretical model of the stern tube journal bearing behaviour, which is proposed to be done in several stages. The initial stage is to consider nonlinear fl uid structural interaction, and this is the theory shown in this article. Owing to the fact that the shaft journal in operation lies on a lubricating fl uid fi lm, which separates the journal in the bearing from the <b>bearing</b> <b>liner,</b> the theoretical nonlinear model of the journal bearing may provide more insight in the behaviour of the shaft inside the bearing and help us to determine a more realistic elastic line of the shafting. The American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) initiated a research project to measure actual interaction between the shaft and the stern tube bearing with the goal of applying obtained knowledge in development of an accurate analytical/numerical model for shaftbearing analysis. The initial focus of the investigation was to capture the transient operation of the shaft inside the bearing and to observe the shaft’s hydrodynamic lift during starting, stopping and reversing of the engine. Proximity probes were used to monitor the shaft bearing interaction with micron precision. The installed probes measure the distance between the shaft and the bearing at eight locations inside the aft stern bush and at four locations inside the forward stern bush, and utilize obtained data to defi ne the shaft orbit and dynamics as it revolves in the bearing. The results of presented measurements show that the shaft behaviour inside the stern bush is very different depending on the locati inside the bush. Therefore, an analytical approach, which uses a simplifi ed theory of shaft bearing interaction, provides no practical value since it neglects shaft dynamics and interaction between fl uid and the structure...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{investigation}} on wheel wear losses from bogie rotation resistance have only considered as designed curve operations [1, 2], {{with a small}} cant deficiency present in the curve design. Results in such curves show a relatively small increase in overall wheel and rail wear due to bogie rotation resistance. The bulk of increased wheel/rail wear is caused by rotation friction moments at the centre bearing, which are generated in the curve transition, being retained into the constant radius curve. Cant Deficient design curves are shown to not retain the full rotational friction moment that is generated in curve transitions. The wear losses on individual wheelsets is shown to be greatly affected by bogie rotation resistance even when the total wheel rail wear for the wagon is not greatly altered. The wheel/rail wear is best described by classifying curves {{by the number of}} wheelsets in flange contact with the high rail. The Queensland coal operations have proportionally much higher wear rate increases attributed to bogie rotation friction. Large reductions of wheel wear have been anecdotally report by QR rollingstock maintenance staff following the introduction of lubricating polymer centre <b>bearing</b> <b>liners.</b> Case study simulations show that the track’s dominant tight curve is very sensitive to high centre bearing friction. The curves occur on a 1 : 50 grade for which loaded traffic is downhill at 40 kph compared to the empty traffic climbing at the speed limit of 60 kph. Hence these dominant downhill curves have a cant excess. Bogie rotation friction management is shown to be particularly important on rollingstock with low warp stiffness that operate through tighter curves at lower than the cant design speed. Such rollingstock will exhibit significantly shortened wheel maintenance cycle times due to high bogie rotation friction retained into the curve and high wheelset angles of attack seen on the leading bogie. Wear rates can become further accelerated due to the negative impact high angles of attack have on gauge face lubrication. Bogie warp and wheelset angles of attack retained in constant radius curves are affected by lateral forces such as coupler angling train forces...|$|R

40|$|Due to the {{environmental}} and health concerns with Electroplated Hard Chrome (EHC), the Hard Chrome Alternatives Team (HCAT) has been working to provide an alternative wear coating for EHC. The US Navy selected Tungsten-Carbide Cobalt (WC- 17 Co) High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) thermal spray coating for this purpose and completed service evaluations on select aircraft components to support the HCAT charter in identifying an alternative wear coating for chrome plating. Other benefits of WC-Co thermal spray coatings over EHC are enhanced corrosion resistance, improved durability, and exceptional wear properties. As part of the HCAT charter and to evaluate HVOF coatings on operational Navy components, the P- 3 aircraft was selected for a service evaluation to determine the coating durability as compared to chrome plating. In April 1999, a VP- 30 P- 3 aircraft was outfitted with a right-hand Main Landing Gear (MLG) shock strut coated with WCCo HYOF thermal spray applied to the piston barrel and four axle journals.

The material combination bronze against steel as typically used in powertrain applications was investigated. The surface structures where machined using electrochemical machining by closed electrolytic free jet (Jet-ECM). It was determined that microstructuring reduced the friction coefficient by up to 45 % in the hydrodynamic regime under loads and speeds found in automotive components. The friction measurements showed that microstructures with low aspect ratios result in the least friction. In addition to the tribological investigations, the process capabilities and implementability in serial production of two surface microstructure fabrication processes: Jet-ECM and a newly developed, hybrid roller micro-embossing and burnishing process were evaluated and contrasted.

40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) This thesis {{concentrates}} {{on the study of}} hybrid gas journal bearings (bearings with externally pressurized mass addition). It differs from most work in that it goes back to “basics” to explore the hydrodynamic phenomena in the bearing gap. The thesis compares geometrically identical bearings with 2 configurations of external pressurization, porous liners where mass-addition compensation is varied by varying the liner’s permeability, and bushings with 2 rows of 6 feedholes where the mass-addition compensation is varied by the feedhole diameter. Experimentally, prototype bearings with mass-addition compensation that spans 2 orders of magnitude with differing clearances are built and their aerostatic properties and mass addition characteristics are thoroughly tested. The fundamental equations for compressible, laminar, Poiseuille flow are used to suggest how the mass flow “compensation” should be mathematically modeled. This is back-checked against the experimental mass flow measurements and is used to determine a mass-addition compensation parameter (called Kmeas) for each prototype bushing. In so doing, the methodology of modeling and measuring the mass addition in a hybrid gas bearing is re-examined and an innovative, practical, and simple method is found that makes it possible to make an “apples-to-apples” comparison between different configurations of external pressurization. This mass addition model is used in conjunction with the Reynolds equation to perform theory-based numerical analysis of virtual hybrid gas journal bearings (CFD experiments). The first CFD experiments performed use virtual bearings modeled to be identical to the experimental prototypes and replicate the experimental work. The results are compared and the CFD model is validated. The ontological significance of appropriate dimensionless similitude parameters is re-examined and a, previously lacking, complete set of similitude factors is found for hybrid bearings. A new practical method is developed to study in unprecedented detail the aerostatic component of the hybrid bearings. It is used to definitively compare the feedhole bearings to the porous <b>liner</b> <b>bearings.</b> The hydrostatic bearing efficiency (HBE) is defined and it is determined that the maximum achievable hydrostatic bearing efficiency (MAHBE) is determined solely by the bearing’s mass addition configuration. The MAHBE of the porous <b>liner</b> <b>bearings</b> is determined to be over 5 times that of the feedhole bearings. The method also presents a means to tune the Kmeas to the clearance to achieve the MAHBE as well as giving a complete mapping of the hitherto misunderstood complex shapes of aerostatic load versus radial deflection curves. This method also rediscovers the obscure phenomenon of static instability which is called in this thesis the “near surface effect” and appears to be the first work to present a practical method to predict the range of static instability and quantify its resultant stiffness fall-off. It determines that porous <b>liner</b> type <b>bearings</b> are not subject to the phenomenon which appears for feedhole type bearings when the clearance exceeds a critical value relative to its mass-addition compensation. The standing pressure waves of hydrostatic and hybrid bearings with the 2 configurations of external pressurization as well as a geometrically identical hydrodynamic bearing are studied in detail under the methodology of the “CFD microscope”. This method is used to characterize and identify the development, growth, and movement of the pressure wave extrema with increased hydrodynamic action (either increasing speed or increasing eccentricity). This method is also used to determine the “cause” of the “near surface effect”. A gedanken experiment is performed based on these results which indicates that a bearing with a “stronger aerostatic strength” component should be more stable than one with a low aerostatic strength component. Numerical instability “speed limits” are found that are also related to the hydrostatic strength of the bearing. The local conditions in the standing waves are characterized in terms of their local Mach number, Knudsen number, Reynolds number, and Taylor Number. It is concluded that low eccentricity bearing whirl {{can be attributed to the}} off load-line orientation of the bearing load force caused by the overlay of the hydrodynamic bearing standing wave onto the hydrostatic bearing wave of the hybrid bearing, whereas it is hypothesized that aperiodic and random self-excited vibration which occurs at high eccentricity, as reported in the literature, is probably due to shock waves, turbulence, near surface effect, and slip at local areas of the standing wave...|$|R
40|$|Plans to {{shut down}} nuclear power plants in some European {{countries}} as well as increased electricity production by wind and solar power will increase the work load on hydroelectric power plants in the future. Also, due to the power grid regulations, hydroelectric power plants undergo more frequent start-ups and shut-downs. During such transient periods, a large amplitude shaft motion can occur, especially in the power plants with vertical shafts. Large shaft motion is not desirable because {{it can lead to}} a machine failure. Furthermore, performance limitations of conventional white metal or babbitted bearings call for the development of new bearing designs. An outstanding tribological performance can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, <b>bearings</b> with compliant <b>liners</b> may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to employ nonlinear analysis to provide further understanding of the compliant bearing dynamic response to synchronous shaft excitation. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a nonlinear approach. The numerical model was verified with an in-house developed code at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Results for the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry were compared with published data in dynamic conditions. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, pivot offset, tapers and pad inclination angles. Influence of the viscoelastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. It was also shown that the compliant liner provides lower maximum oil film pressure and thicker minimum oil film thickness in the bearing mid-plane in both static and dynamic operating conditions.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} {{on the study of}} hybrid gas journal bearings (bearings with externally pressurized mass addition). It differs from most work in that it goes back to 2 ̆ 2 basics 2 ̆ 2 to explore the hydrodynamic phenomena in the bearing gap. The thesis compares geometrically identical bearings with 2 configurations of external pressurization, porous liners where mass-addition compensation is varied by varying the liner 2 ̆ 7 s permeability, and bushings with 2 rows of 6 feedholes where the mass-addition compensation is varied by the feedhole diameter. Experimentally, prototype bearings with mass-addition compensation that spans 2 orders of magnitude with differing clearances are built and their aerostatic properties and mass addition characteristics are thoroughly tested. The fundamental equations for compressible, laminar, Poiseuille flow are used to suggest how the mass flow 2 ̆ 2 compensation 2 ̆ 2 should be mathematically modeled. This is back-checked against the experimental mass flow measurements and is used to determine a mass-addition compensation parameter (called Kmeas) for each prototype bushing. In so doing, the methodology of modeling and measuring the mass addition in a hybrid gas bearing is re-examined and an innovative, practical, and simple method is found that makes it possible to make an 2 ̆ 2 apples-to-apples 2 ̆ 2 comparison between different configurations of external pressurization. This mass addition model is used in conjunction with the Reynolds equation to perform theory-based numerical analysis of virtual hybrid gas journal bearings (CFD experiments). The first CFD experiments performed use virtual bearings modeled to be identical to the experimental prototypes and replicate the experimental work. The results are compared and the CFD model is validated. The ontological significance of appropriate dimensionless similitude parameters is re-examined and a, previously lacking, complete set of similitude factors is found for hybrid bearings. A new practical method is developed to study in unprecedented detail the aerostatic component of the hybrid bearings. It is used to definitively compare the feedhole bearings to the porous <b>liner</b> <b>bearings.</b> The hydrostatic bearing efficiency (HBE) is defined and it is determined that the maximum achievable hydrostatic bearing efficiency (MAHBE) is determined solely by the bearing 2 ̆ 7 s mass addition configuration. The MAHBE of the porous <b>liner</b> <b>bearings</b> is determined to be over 5 times that of the feedhole bearings. The method also presents a means to tune the Kmeas to the clearance to achieve the MAHBE as well as giving a complete mapping of the hitherto misunderstood complex shapes of aerostatic load versus radial deflection curves. This method also rediscovers the obscure phenomenon of static instability which is called in this thesis the 2 ̆ 2 near surface effect 2 ̆ 2 and appears to be the first work to present a practical method to predict the range of static instability and quantify its resultant stiffness fall-off. It determines that porous <b>liner</b> type <b>bearings</b> are not subject to the phenomenon which appears for feedhole type bearings when the clearance exceeds a critical value relative to its mass-addition compensation.

This method is used to characterize and identify the development, growth, and movement of the pressure wave extrema with increased hydrodynamic action (either increasing speed or increasing eccentricity).

40|$|Due to {{government}} regulations together with {{health and safety}} reasons, there are increasing demands on reducing hazardous polluting chemicals from fossil fuel power plants. Therefore, more efforts are imposed on using renewable resources such as water, wind, solar and tide to produce clean/green electricity. On top of that, there is another increasing demand from Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to operate power plants with higher load while keep the power loss to the minimum. These requirements drive conventional fluid film bearings to its mechanical and temperature limits. This calls {{for the development of}} new bearing system designs. An outstanding tribological performance such as low start-up and break-away friction, excellent resistance to chemical attack and anti-seizure properties, can be achieved by introducing compliant polymer liners. At the same time, <b>bearings</b> with compliant <b>liners</b> may alter rotor-bearing system dynamic behaviour compared to the systems with conventional white metal bearings. The research approach of this thesis is to implement compliant <b>liner</b> on <b>bearing</b> surface, impose synchronous shaft excitation and investigate the effect of bearing design parameters on bearing dynamic response. Plain cylindrical journal bearings with different compliant liner thicknesses were analysed using a FEM approach. The numerical model was compared with an in-house developed code based on the finite difference method (FDM) for a bearing operated at steady state conditions. Results obtained by the numerical models showed good agreement. After verification of the numerical model for fixed geometry journal bearings, models for tilting pad journal bearings were developed. Dynamic behaviour of the tilting pad journal bearing with three pads with line pivot geometry was compared with published data. A good agreement was obtained between the two numerical models. The effect of pad pivot geometry on bearing dynamic response was investigated. Vertical and horizontal shaft configurations were compared in terms of the effect of preload factor, radial clearance, pivot offset, and pad inclination angles. Influence of the elastic properties of compliant liners was also studied. All these factors significantly affect bearing dynamic response. It is shown how these factors should be selected to control the journal orbit sizes. Misalignments in compliant tilting pad journal bearings were analysed for load between pivots and load on pivots with consideration of thermal effects. Significant improvements in bearing performance were obtained with compliant bearings compared to white metal bearings. Furthermore, different polymer materials (PTFE, UHMWPE, pure PEEK and PEEK composite) were characterized using Frequency Response Function (FRF). It was shown that as the excitation frequency increased the equivalent stiffness was more or less constant while equivalent damping decreased exponentially. PTFE had similar equivalent stiffness compared to PEEK. As for equivalent damping, PTFE had slightly higher damping compared to PEEK or UHMWPE. Oil film thickness, oil film temperature and loads on tilting pad journal bearing were measured on 10 MW Kaplan hydroelectric power machine. Test results were compared to FEM model. It was shown that stiffness of the supporting structure may be more important to machine performance than the stiffness of the bearing alone. QC 20150409 Swedish Hydropower Centr...|$|R
