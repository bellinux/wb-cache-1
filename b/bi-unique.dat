Our results will improve all the results in connection to the <b>bi-unique</b> range sets to a large extent. A number of examples have been exhibited to justify our certain claims. At last an open question have been posed for future investigations...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{well known}} that for a {{connected}} locally path-connected semi-locally 1 -connected space X, there exists a <b>bi-unique</b> correspondence between the pointed d-fold connected coverings and the transitive representations of the fundamental group of X in the symmetric group Σd of degree d. The classification problem becomes more difficult if X is a more general space, particularly if X is not locally connected. In attempt to solve the problem for general spaces, several notions of coverings have been introduced, for example, those given by Lubkin or by Fox. On the other hand, different notions of ‘fundamental group’ have appeared in the mathematical literature, for instance, the Brown–Grossman–Quigley fundamental group, the Čech–Borsuk fundamental group, the Steenrod–Quigley fundamental group, the fundamental profinite group or the fundamental localic group. The main result of this paper determines different ‘fundamental groups’ {{that can be used to}} classify pointed finite sheeted connected coverings of a given space X depending on topological properties of X...|$|E
40|$|As K ātyāyana {{emphasizes}} while {{commenting on}} the ekaśeṣa-rules, words apply per object. Consequently, no word should be capable of conveying more than one object. By contrast not only does paronomasia, the so-called śleṣa, break the one-to-one relation between the śabda- and artha-levels of language; there are also grammatical rules which look like deviations from the naturally expected cause-effect relation between word forms and their meanings. T he ekaśeṣa-rule represents one of these exceptions, since {{some parts of the}} artha are comprehensible, even without employing the word-form denoting them, such as mātṛ in the dual noun pitarau, meaning ‘mother and father’ rather than ‘the two fathers’. P atañjali already mentions an intriguing option in the use of śabdas, when he notes that a word form can merely convey its primary denotation, such as candra denoting the ‘moon’, or can express something that is ‘like something else’, such as candra conveying the sense of a ‘face like a moon’. These exceptions are reconsidered here {{within the framework of the}} “yugapad-expression”, which is how Bhartṛhari defines one of the two language options (the other one being kramaḥ ‘sequence’), an option realised when a single word simultaneously conveys more than one meaning, but an option whose use is discouraged. Technical (ritual and grammatical) speculations on simultaneity as an exception to the <b>bi-unique</b> relationship between a cause and its effect date back to the 2 nd to 3 rd centuries BC. N onetheless, grammarians insist on excluding these extreme applications of meaning extension; only the late kāvyālaṃkāraśāstra- authors extol the virtues of the phenomenon. T he paper focuses on the trajectory that might have been followed in the intervening changes...|$|E
