40|$|Coupled atmosphere–ocean {{dynamics}} in the North Atlantic is studied {{by means of}} a simple model, featuring a <b>baroclinic</b> three-dimensional <b>atmosphere</b> coupled to a slab ocean. Anomalous oceanic heat transport due to wind-driven circulation is parameterized in terms of a delayed response to the change in wind stress curl due to the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Climate variability for different strengths of ocean heat transport efficiency is analyzed. Two types of behavior are found depending on time scale. At interdecadal and longer time scales, a negative feedback is found that leads to a reduction in the spectral power of the NAO. By greatly increasing the efficiency of ocean heat transport, the NAO in the model can be made to completely vanish from the principal modes of variability at low frequency. This suggests that the observed NAO variability at these time scales must be due to mechanisms other than the interaction with wind-driven circulation. At decadal time scales, a coupled oscillation is found in which SST and geopotential height fields covary. 1...|$|R

The attraction of the isentropic coordinate model was largely theoretical because for adiabatic flow the isentropic surfaces are material surfaces. Given the low resolution of atmospheric models, a higher degree of accuracy could be expected for the advective terms with an isentropic formulation. Significant problems with the handling of the lower boundary condition and its implication for conservation and boundary layer approximations were addressed by t [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} the flow induced by an east–west-oriented oceanic thermal front {{in a highly}} idealized baroclinic model. Previous work showed that thermal fronts could produce energetic midlatitude jets in an equivalent-barotropic atmosphere and that barotropic instabilities of this jet had dominant periods of 25 – 30 and 65 – 75 days. The present study extends this work to a two-mode <b>baroclinic</b> free <b>atmosphere.</b> The <b>baroclinic</b> jet produced {{in this case is}} subject to both barotropic and baroclinic instabilities. A barotropic symmetric instability propagates westward with periods of roughly 30 days and is similar to those found in the equivalent-barotropic model. A baroclinic instability results in standing-dipole anomalies and oscillates with a period of 6 – 8 months. A mixed barotropic–baroclinic instability results in anomalies that propagate northward, perpendicular to the jet, with a period of 2 – 3 months. The later anomalies are reminiscent of the 70 -day oscillation found over the North Atlantic in observed fields. The atmospheric flow has two distinct states: the flow in the high-energy state exhibits two large gyres and a strong eastward jet; its antisymmetric component is dominant. The low-energy flow is characterized by small gyres and a weak jet. The model’s dynamics depends on the layer-depth ratio. When the model is nearly equivalent-barotropic, symmetric oscillatory modes dominate. As the two layers become nearly equal, antisymmetric oscillatory modes become significant and the mean energy of the flow increases. When the oceanic thermal front’s strength T * is weak (T * � 1. 5 °C), the flow is steady. For intermediate values of the strength (1. 5 °C � T * � 3 °C), several oscillatory instabilities set in. As the frontal strength increases further (T * � 3 °C), the flow becomes more turbulent. These results all depend on the atmospheric model’s horizontal resolution being sufficiently high. 1...|$|R

40|$|In the off-equatorial {{region of}} Jupiter’s and Saturn’s <b>atmospheres,</b> <b>baroclinic</b> eddies {{transport}} angular momentum out of retrograde and into prograde jets. In a statistically steady state, this angular momentum transfer by eddies must be balanced by dissipation, likely produced by magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) drag in the planetary interior. This paper examines systematically how an idealized representation of this drag {{in a general}} circulation model (GCM) of the upper atmosphere of giant planets modifies jet characteristics, the angular momentum budget, and the energy budget. In the GCM, Rayleigh drag at an artificial lower boundary (with mean pressure of 3 bar) {{is used as a}} simple representation of the MHD drag that the flow on giant planets experiences at depth. As the drag coefficient decreases, the eddy length scale and eddy kinetic energy increase, as they do in studies of two-dimensional turbulence. Off-equatorial jets become wider and stronger, with increased interjet spacing. Coherent vortices also become more prevalent. Generally, the jet width scales with the Rhines scale, which is of similar magnitude as the Rossby radius in the simulations. The jet strength increases primarily through strengthening of the barotropic component, which increases as the drag coefficient decreases because the overall kinetic energy dissipation remains roughly constant. The overall kinetic energy dissipation remains roughly constant presumably because it is controlled by baroclinic conversion of potential to kinetic energy in the upper troposphere, which is mainly determined by the differential solar radiation and is only weakly dependent on bottom drag and barotropic flow variations. For Jupiter and Saturn, these results suggest that the wider and stronger jets on Saturn may arise because the MHD drag on Saturn is weaker than on Jupiter, while the thermodynamic efficiencies of the atmospheres are not sensitive to the drag parameters...|$|R

Described applications of the scheme are related to a steady state solution with shear instability, an unstable nonlinear Ekman boundary layer, and the steady state solution of a <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> with asymmetric forcing.

Finally, the exact solutions to the equation are given by employing the (-ϕ(ξ)) method.

Sufficient stability conditions for an infinite atmosphere (i. e. with a temperature lapse rate equal to zero) are satisfied only for an atmosphere in solid body rotation. For a polytropic atmosphere of finite extent (a lapse rate is not equal zero) the sufficient conditions of stability can be satisfied if a lid is placed below min (Z max, polytropic atmospheric height).

40|$|As a {{step toward}} a more {{comprehensive}} study of the physical processes that underlie explosive cyclogenesis, a two-dimensional, semigeostrophic model with a now standard parameterization of latent heat release is used to diagnose the structure, energetics, and propagation characteristics of short-scale, diabatic normal modes in a moist, <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> with the Eady basic state. Upon revisiting the inviscid problem, {{it is found that}} when a thermodynamically consistent vertical profile of latent heat release is used, the short-wave cutoff vanishes, and growth rates become independent of zonal wavelength for zonal wavelengths shorter than approximately 1900 km. The destabilized short-scale modes, identified previously as diabatic Rossby waves, owe their existence to the continuous generation of potential vorticity by moist processes associated with warm air advection, rising motion, and latent heat release. To determine if these short-scale, diabatic Rossby wave modes continue to grow at small but finite amplitudes in the presence of frictional damping, a standard Ekman boundary layer with quadratic surface drag is employed. It is found that exponential growth is robust over a wide range of zonal wavelengths during the incipient phase of moist cyclogenesis and that, once generated, the short-scale, diabatic modes persist even in the presence of ‘‘realistic’ ’ surface friction...|$|E

For such a study, oceanic and atmospheric satellite data are necessary. Models assume a baroclinic ocean with a mixed layer coupled to a <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> to simulate the anomalous fields. The various data have been used to revisit the parameterizations of the subsurface temperature in the mixed layer, atmospheric convection, and friction in the baroclinic ocean. This new model, named Tsub.

The atmospheric model still presents some deficiencies in the eastern Pacific and when it is replaced by a statistical atmosphere, the coupled model (Tsub. Astat) performs even better. It is found that the off-equatorial ocean and wind curl anomalies play a crucial role for all these models and that Tsub. Astat simulates an ocean heat content recharge coming from the north prior to a warm event like the ones observed during the 1985 - 1992 period.

40|$|At {{temperate}} latitudes the synoptic {{patterns of}} bird migration are strongly structured {{by the presence}} of cyclones and anticyclones, both in the horizontal and altitudinal dimensions. In certain synoptic conditions, birds may efficiently cross regions with opposing surface wind by choosing a higher flight altitude with more favourable wind. We observed migratory passerines at mid-latitudes that selected high altitude wind optima on particular nights, leading to the formation of structured migration layers at varying altitude up to 3 km. Using long-term vertical profiling of bird migration by C-band Doppler radar in the Netherlands, we find that such migration layers occur nearly exclusively during spring migration {{in the presence of a}} high-pressure system. A conceptual analytic framework providing insight into the synoptic patterns of wind assistance for migrants that includes the altitudinal dimension has so far been lacking. We present a simple model for a <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> that relates vertical profiles of wind assistance to the pressure and temperature patterns occurring at temperate latitudes. We show how the magnitude and direction of the large scale horizontal temperature gradient affects the relative gain in wind assistance that migrants obtain through ascending. Temperature gradients typical for northerly high-pressure systems in spring are shown to cause high altitude wind optima in the easterly sectors of anticyclones, thereby explaining the frequent observations of high altitude migration in these synoptic conditions. Given the recurring synoptic arrangements of pressure systems across temperate continents, the opportunities for exploiting high altitude win...|$|E
40|$|Using rain-gauge {{measurements}} and reanalysis data sets for 1948 - 2015, we propose a mechanism {{that controls the}} interannual variation of summer monsoon onset over central India. In May, about {{a month before the}} onset, the low level jet over the Arabian Sea is about 40 % stronger and about 2. 5 degrees northward during years of early onset as compared to years of late onset. A stronger and northward shifted low level jet carries about 50 % more moisture in early onset years, which increases low level moist static energy over central India in the pre-monsoon season. The increase in low level moist static energy decreases the stability of the atmosphere and makes it conducive for convection. The strength and position of the low level jet are determined by surface pressure gradient between western Asia and the west-equatorial Indian Ocean. Thus, an anomalous surface pressure low over western Asia in the pre-monsoon season increases this gradient and strengthens the jet. Moreover, a stronger low level jet increases the meridional shear of zonal wind and supports the formation of an onset vortex in a stronger <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> These developments are favourable for an early onset of the monsoon over the central Indian region. Our study postulates a new physical mechanism for the interannual variation of onset over central India, the core of the Indian monsoon region and relevant to Indian agriculture, and could be tested for real-time prediction...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} convection over warm pool region of Indonesia on northwest India winter precipitation (NWIWP) using an analysis of latest available observed climate data. The analysis is based on correlations and composites performed using India Meteorological Department (IMD) records of station data. We find {{that there is an}} out-of-phase relationship between convection over warm pool region and northwest India during the winter season. In particular, a positive precipitation anomaly over northwest India is typically found in correspondence to subdued convection over warm pool region. A physical mechanism for such effect is proposed, by which during excess years of NWIWP the tropical cooling over the warm pool region due to Suppressed convection generates an Upper-level convergence (cyclonic circulation) anomaly over South Asia which intensifies the westerly jet stream over Indian region. Also, the reduced convection over the warm pool may be due to reduced Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) activities on the intra-seasonal timescale. The Rossby-gyre dynamics with the strong vertical and westward meridional tilts in the tropical <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> forms cyclonic circulation anomalies at the upper troposphere due to a weak MJO which intensifies the westerly jet stream over the Indian region. The jet stream guides the western disturbances (WDs) and hence increases precipitation over northwest India. The seasonal persistence in migration of convective maximum from south Asia (foothills of the Himalayas) to Indonesia during the peak months of boreal summer to winter increases the seasonal predictability of NWIWP.

40|$|A new large eddy {{simulation}} (LES) code {{is developed}} {{and used to}} investigate non-local features of turbulent planetary boundary layers (PBLs). The LES code is based on filtered Navier-Stokes equations, which describe motions of incompressible, Boussinesq fluid at high Reynolds numbers. The code computes directly large-scale, non-universal turbulence in the PBL whereas small-scale, universal turbulence is parameterized by a dynamic mixed subgrid closure. The LES code is thoroughly tested against high quality laboratory and field data. This study addresses non-local properties of turbulence which emphasis on the stable stratification. Its basic results are as follows. The flow stability in PBLs is generally caused by two mechanisms: the negative buoyancy force (in the stable density stratification) and the Coriolis force (in the rotating system). The latter stabilizes the flow if the earth’s vorticity and the turbulent vorticity are anti-parallel. The Coriolis force stability suppresses large-scale turbulence and makes large eddies asymmetric. The density stratification suppresses vertical scales of turbulence. Joint actions of the Coriolis and the buoyancy forces result in a more complex behavior of turbulence. Particularly, the layers of vigorous turbulence may appear {{in the course of}} development of low-level jets in <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Non-local effects determine integral measures of PBLs, first of all the PBL depth. This study clearly demonstrates its pronounced dependences on the Coriolis parameter, the Kazanski-Monin internal stability parameter, and newly introduced imposed-stability and baroclinicity parameters. An LES database is created and used to validate an advanced PBL-depth formulation. LES support the idea that PBLs interact with the stably stratified free flow through the radiation of gravity waves, excited by large turbulent eddies at the interface...|$|E
40|$|Numerical {{simulations}} {{are carried}} out to examine {{the role of the}} Kuo and Kain-Fritsch (KF) cumulus parameterization schemes and dry dynamics on a cyclone development, in a weak <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> over subtropical South Atlantic Ocean. The initial phase of the cyclone development is investigated with a coarse horizontal mesh (75 km) and when the cyclone reaches the mature stage two different horizontal resolutions are used (75 and 25 km). The best performance simulation for the cyclone initial phase occurs when the Kuo convective scheme is applied, and this may be attributed to a greater diabatic warming in the troposphere. On the other hand, the dry simulation is not capable of simulating the correct location and intensity of the cyclone in its initial phase. During the mature phase, a cyclone over deepening occurs in the Kuo scheme experiment associated with larger latent heat release in a deep vertical column. The presence of downdraft currents in the KF scheme, which acts to cool and dry the lower levels, is essential to stabilize the atmosphere and to reproduce the nearest observation cyclone deepening rate. The largest cyclone deepening is found in the Kuo scheme high resolution experiment. This suggests that the KF convective scheme is less sensitive to the horizontal grid resolution. It was also revealed that the diabatic processes are crucial to simulate the observed features of this marine cyclone over subtropical region.

40|$|Useful {{forecasts}} may {{be obtained}} by graphical integrations of the dynamical prediction equations for a barotropic and a two-level <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere.</b> Such forecasts may be prepared {{without the aid of}} special equipment and are therefore particularly valuable as a means of training forecasters in physical prognosis. The present paper reviews the physical principles, modeling assumptions, and methods of solution used in graphical prediction and introduces a method of obtaining surface forecasts which is considerably faster and simpler than previous methods. The predicted surface pressure is shown to be the sum of two components: (1) the pressure advected to the spot by one-half the 500 -mb. wind and (2) a pressure change reflected down from aloft (actually one-half the 500 -mb. height change expressed in equivalent pressure units at 1000 mb.). The movement of surface pressure systems is thus seen to be largely dependent on upper-level steering, while the deepening is found {{to be related to the}} vorticity advection at high levels, since t. his mainly determines the 500 -mb. height changes. Twenty sample surface forecasts prepared by the graphical method during July 1959 are presented and compared with the forecasts for the same dates issued by the National Weather Analysis Center. Little difference in accuracy is apparent. Typical shortcomings and failures of the graphical prognoses are discussed. It is believed that the most serious errors are due to the use of only the init’ial 500 -mbxharts in advect. ing the pressure systems. If the 500 -mb. forecasts had been available earlier, it appears that a significant increase in accuracy could have been achieved by using both initial and forecast 500 -mb. contours in performing the advections. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of a low-order coupled wind-driven ocean–atmosphere system is investigated {{with emphasis on}} its predictability properties. The low-order coupled deterministic system is composed of a <b>baroclinic</b> <b>atmosphere</b> for which 12 dominant dynamical modes are only retained (Charney and Straus in J Atmos Sci 37 : 1157 – 1176, 1980) and a wind-driven, quasi-geostrophic and reduced-gravity shallow ocean whose field is truncated to four dominant modes able to reproduce the large scale oceanic gyres (Pierini in J Phys Oceanogr 41 : 1585 – 1604, 2011). The two models are coupled through mechanical forcings only. The analysis of its dynamics reveals first that under aperiodic atmospheric forcings only dominant single gyres (clockwise or counterclockwise) appear, while for periodic atmospheric solutions the double gyres emerge. In the present model domain setting context, this feature {{is related to the}} level of truncation of the atmospheric fields, as indicated by a preliminary analysis of the impact of higher wavenumber (“synoptic” scale) modes on the development of oceanic gyres. In the latter case, double gyres appear {{in the presence of a}} chaotic atmosphere. Second the dynamical quantities characterizing the short-term predictability (Lyapunov exponents, Lyapunov dimension, Kolmogorov–Sinaï (KS) entropy) displays a complex dependence as a function of the key parameters of the system, namely the coupling strength and the external thermal forcing. In particular, the KS-entropy is increasing as a function of the coupling in most of the experiments, implying an increase of the rate of loss of information about the localization of the system on its attractor. Finally the {{dynamics of}} the error is explored and indicates, in particular, a rich variety of short term behaviors of the error in the atmosphere depending on the (relative) amplitude of the initial error affecting the ocean, from polynomial (at 2 + bt 3 + ct 4) up to exponential-like evolutions.
