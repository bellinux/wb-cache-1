5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but this distinction is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E

5|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} in beak size {{may have}} affected behaviour. Such dimorphism is common in other parrots, for example in the palm cockatoo and the New Zealand kaka. In species where it occurs, the sexes prefer food of different sizes, the males use their beaks in rituals, or the sexes have specialised roles in nesting and rearing. Similarly, the large difference <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female head size may have been reflected in the ecology of each sex, though {{it is impossible to}} determine how.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling.

5|$|Like all Australasian robins, {{the flame}} robin is a perch and pounce hunter, mainly eating insects, and often {{returning}} to a favourite low perch several times to stand erect and motionless, scanning the leaf-litter for more prey. They are typically seen in pairs (during {{the spring and summer}} breeding season) or in loose companies in more open country in winter, when they more commonly feed on the ground. A field study in the Southern Tablelands of New South Wales found no significant difference in foraging behaviour <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female flame robins. Birds have been recorded foraging for insects in furrows in freshly ploughed fields. In Deniliquin, a flame robin was observed holding one foot forward and pattering the ground repeatedly to disturb ground-dwelling insects, and then watching and snapping up any which emerged; this behaviour is otherwise seen in waders.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{anatomical}} {{differences exist}} <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females; these are manifested on {{a molecular level}} by different hormonal environments. Although several molecular differences in adult tissues have been identified, a comprehensive investigation of the gene expression differences <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females has not been performed. We surveyed the expression patterns of 13, 977 mouse genes in <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female hypothalamus, kidney, liver, and reproductive tissues. Extensive differential gene expression was observed {{not only in the}} reproductive tissues, but also in the kidney and liver. The differentially expressed genes are involved in drug and steroid metabolism, osmotic regulation, or as yet unresolved cellular roles. In contrast, very few molecular differences were observed <b>between</b> the <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female hypothalamus in both mice and humans. We conclude that there are persistent differences in gene expression <b>between</b> adult <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females. These molecular differences have important implications for the physiological differences <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females...|$|R

5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} usually solitary, though aggregations of 2050 {{individuals}} have been recorded. Off southeast Queensland, aggregations {{of several hundred}} zebra sharks form every summer in shallow water. These aggregations consist entirely of large adults, with females outnumbering males by almost three to one. The purpose of these aggregations is yet unclear; no definite mating behavior has been observed between the sharks. There is an observation of an adult male zebra shark biting the pectoral fin of another adult male and pushing him against the sea floor; the second male was turned on his back, and remained motionless for several minutes. This behavior resembles pre-copulatory behaviors <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female sharks, and {{in both cases the}} biting and holding of the pectoral fin has been speculated to relate to one shark asserting dominance over the other.|$|E
25|$|The wide gap <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female {{labor force}} {{participation}} rates and ratios, and the gap <b>between</b> <b>male</b> <b>and</b> female employers is indicative of gender inequality within the private sector of majority Muslim countries.

The thesis tries to capture the main features of so-called <b>male</b> mortality excess, <b>and</b> also tries to find its specifics in each individual state.

In the analytical part of the thesis, the methods of standardization, mortality tables and Pollard's two-dimensional decomposition of the difference in life expectancy at birth <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females are used. To illustrate the situation of male mortality excess on the different groups of causes of death, contour plots of contributions to the difference in life expectancy at birth <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females were created.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{estimating}} wage differences <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females in Egypt {{to understand the}} determinants of the gender wage gap and control of this variation.

The findings of this paper help deepen the understanding of the wage gap <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females in Egypt by determining differences in wages due to real variations in characteristics between both genders, for example, education and experience and differences due to discrimination against women in addition to determining differences due to selectivity bias.

External and internal plumage concentrations likely differ between specific trace metals, and may further differ <b>between</b> <b>males</b> <b>and</b> females because of potential sex-linked differential urban use, physiology or behaviour. Here, we measured the concentrations in four trace metals (cadmium, copper, lead and zinc) in both unwashed and washed feathers of 49 <b>male</b> <b>and</b> 38 female feral pigeons (Columba livia) from Parisian agglomeration.
