The ribbon itself {{must be at least}} 35g (1oz), 4–6cm (1.6–2.4") in width and for senior category a minimum length of 6m (20') (5m (16.25') for juniors). The ribbon must be in one piece. The end that is attached to the stick is doubled for a maximum length of 1m (3'). This is stitched down both sides. At the top, a very thin reinforcement or rows of machine stitching for a maximum length of 5cm is authorized. This extremity may end in a strap, or have an eyelet (a small hole, edged with <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch</b> or a metal circle), to permit attaching the ribbon. The ribbon is fixed to the stick by means of a supple attachment such as thread, nylon cord, or a series of articulated rings. The attachment has a maximum length of 7cm (2.8"), not counting the strap or metal ring {{at the end of the}} stick where it will be fastened. Compulsory elements for the ribbon include flicks, circles, snakes and spirals, and throws. It requires a high degree of co-ordination to form the spirals and circles as any knots which may accidentally form in the ribbon are penalised. During a ribbon routine, large, smooth and flowing movements are looked for.|$|E

500|$|The first {{pattern book}} for {{embroidery}} published in England was Moryssche & Damaschin renewed & encreased very popular for Goldsmiths & Embroiderers by Thomas Geminus (1545). [...] Moryssche or Moresque refers to Moorish or arabesque designs of spirals, scrolls, and zigzags, {{an important part}} of the reportoire of Renaissance ornament in many media. [...] Scrolling patterns of flowers and leaves filled with geometric filling stitches are characteristic of blackwork from the 1540s through 1590s, and similar patterns worked in coloured silks appear from the 1560s, outlined in backstitch and filled with detached <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch.</b>|$|E

50|$|Point is a flat {{needlepoint}} lace {{with rows of}} knotted <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitches</b> worked over stretched threads. Simple designs are created by holes left in otherwise plain cloth work formed by the <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitches.</b> Noted for its appearance in baby clothes in the 18th and early 19th century, particularly in caps, the shoulder seams of shirts, bibs and detachable sleeves worn over babies swaddling bands.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Buttonhole</b> <b>stitches</b> {{are also}} used in cutwork, {{including}} Broderie Anglaise, and {{form the basis for}} many forms of needlelace.|$|R
500|$|These {{stories were}} {{executed}} in canvaswork or in coloured silks in a uniquely English style called raised work, usually {{known by its}} modern name stumpwork. Raised work arose from the detached <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch</b> fillings and braided scrolls of late Elizabethan embroidery. [...] Areas of the embroidery were worked on white or ivory silk grounds {{in a variety of}} stitches and prominent features were padded with horsehair or lambswool, or worked around wooden shapes or wire frames. [...] Ribbons, spangles, beads, small pieces of lace, canvaswork slips, and other objects were added to increase the dimensionality of the finished work.|$|E

50|$|Pakko {{done by the}} Sodha, Rajput and Megwar people, {{which is}} akin to the Ahir style with {{dominance}} of geometric designs with an embossed appearance and is embroidered with close knitting with <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Jali stitch is {{one where}} the thread is never drawn through the fabric, {{ensuring}} that the back portion of the garment looks as impeccable as the front. The warp and weft threads are carefully drawn apart and minute <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitches</b> are inserted into the cloth.|$|R

50|$|<b>Buttonhole</b> <b>stitch</b> and {{the related}} blanket stitch are hand-sewing {{stitches}} used in tailoring, embroidery, and needle lace-making.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Buttonhole</b> <b>stitches</b> catch a loop of {{the thread}} {{on the surface}} of the fabric and needle is {{returned}} to the back of the fabric at a right angle to the original start of the thread. The finished stitch in some ways resembles a letter [...] "L" [...] depending on the spacing of the <b>stitches.</b> For <b>buttonholes</b> the <b>stitches</b> are tightly packed together and for blanket edges they are more spaced out. The properties of this stitch make it ideal for preventing raveling of woven fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Broderie anglaise is {{characterized}} by patterns composed of round or oval holes, called eyelets, which are {{cut out of the}} fabric, then bound with overcast or <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitches.</b> [...] The patterns, often depicting flowers, leaves, vines, or stems, are further delineated by simple embroidery stitches made on the surrounding material. Later broderie anglaise also featured small patterns worked in satin stitch.|$|R
50|$|Another {{embroidery}} {{style that}} combines drawn thread work with needlelace techniques is Hedebo from Denmark, which originates {{from the area}} around Copenhagen and Roskilde. It uses techniques that are clearly distinct from reticella and traditional Italian neddlelace {{on the one hand}} and Hardanger on the other. It does make extensive use of <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitches,</b> but they are done slightly differently than in Italian embroidery.|$|R
50|$|Any type of knit {{buttonhole}} can {{be strengthened}} (and given neater edges) with embroidery, specifically the <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch.</b>|$|E

50|$|Some of {{the basic}} {{techniques}} or stitches of the earliest embroidery are chain <b>stitch,</b> <b>buttonhole</b> or blanket <b>stitch,</b> running stitch, satin stitch, cross stitch. Those stitches remain the fundamental techniques of hand embroidery today.|$|R
5000|$|Suzanis {{usually have}} a cotton (sometimes silk) fabric base, which is {{embroidered}} in silk or cotton thread. Chain, satin, and <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitches</b> are the primary stitches used. There is also extensive use of couching, in which decorative thread laid on the fabric as a raised line is stitched in place with a second thread. Suzanis are often made in two or more pieces, that are then stitched together ...|$|R
50|$|Types of {{stitches}}—including chain <b>stitch,</b> <b>buttonhole</b> or blanket <b>stitch,</b> running stitch, satin stitch, {{and cross}} stitch— {{are the basis}} of embroidery. Patches are often crafted from chain, satin, and hemming stitches and machine work relies {{on the use of}} multiple threads.|$|R
5000|$|Neran meaning [...] "eye brows" [...] is {{a unique}} style which adopts <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch</b> {{in the shape of}} a curve.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Embroidery with {{stems in}} {{buttonhole}} and leaves in detached <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch,</b> worked in natural perle cotton on cotton-linen fabric, United States, 1990s.|$|E
50|$|Blanket stitch, <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch,</b> and eyelet stitch {{all had the}} {{original}} function of strengthening the edges of textiles subject to daily wear and tear, but were adapted for decorative purposes. In North Africa and the Middle East, eyelet stitch is made using a spoked wheel pattern of stitches, or in the Algerian form without an enclosing circle. In Turkmenistan, hook and tulip motifs could be worked in <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch.</b> In Afghanistan, men's shirts could be embroidered with herringbone and buttonhole stitches in white silk on white cotton, in elaborate arabesques.|$|E
5000|$|A button front shirt {{without a}} {{separate}} pieced placket {{is called a}} [...] "French placket." [...] The fabric is simply folded over and the <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitching</b> secures the two layers (or three layers {{if there is an}} interlining). This method affords a very clean finish, especially if heavily patterned fabrics are being used. This method is normally only used in stiff-fronted formal evening ("white-tie") shirts. However, the normal, separate placket on a shirt gives a more symmetrical appearance.|$|R
5000|$|Reticella lace {{is a form}} of {{embroidery}} {{in which}} typical techniques of needlelace are used to embellish drawn thread work. It was first used in 16th century Italy. Needlelace evolved from this when the lacemakers realized that they can do the same things without any supporting fabric. High quality reticella is done with thread almost as thin as sewing silk. Ruskin lace is in fact a near-modern form of it. Warp and weft threads are removed, and the remaining threads are overcast with <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitches,</b> as in needlelace.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{people think}} that a kilt pin could damage a kilt. As President of the Scottish Society (1914), Loudon MacQueen Douglas, point outs, a [...] "claw brooch" [...] (a popular style made from an animal claw) is easily caught on a lady's dress while dancing {{potentially}} damaging both the dress and the kilts. A precaution can be taken in applying <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitching</b> around the hole where the kilt pin goes into the cloth. This strengthens the cloth so that tearing is less likely. Placing a piece of leather behind the front apron and attaching the Kilt Pin through the cloth and the leather could also {{reduce the likelihood of}} tearing.|$|R
50|$|The Craft {{involves}} embroidering and stitching. For {{attaching the}} pieces of cloth articians use straight stitch, satin stitch, blind stitch, or <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch.</b> Sometimes they also make mirror work and many decorative stitches.|$|E
50|$|This {{ornamentation}} method {{originated in}} Persia during 13th century and involves {{little pieces of}} mirror in various sizes which are encased in the decoration of the fabric first by interlacing threads and then with <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Featherstitch {{embroidery}} {{arose in}} England in the 19th century for decorating smock-frocks. It {{is also used}} to decorate the joins in crazy quilting. It is related to (and probably derives from) the older <b>buttonhole</b> <b>stitch</b> and chain stitch.|$|E
50|$|A zigzag stitch is variant {{geometry}} of the lockstitch. It is a back-and-forth stitch used where a straight stitch will not suffice, such as in reinforcing <b>buttonholes,</b> in <b>stitching</b> stretchable fabrics, and in temporarily joining two work pieces edge-to-edge.|$|R
50|$|Hardanger {{embroidery}} is a {{style of}} drawn thread work that is most popular today. It originally comes from Norway, from the traditional district of Hardanger. The backbone of Hardanger designs consists of satin stitches. In geometrical areas both warp and weft threads are removed and the remaining mesh is secured with simple weaving or warping or with {{a limited number of}} simple filling patterns. The designs tend to be geometric, if they include flowers or such they are very stylized {{due to the nature of}} the technique. Hardanger never includes <b>Buttonhole</b> <b>stitches,</b> except for securing the edges of a piece of fabric. It is usually executed using rather coarse fabric and thread.|$|R
