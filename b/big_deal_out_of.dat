500|$|Several of {{the special}} effects used in the episode were created in a [...] "low-stress" [...] manner that did not rely wholly on Computer-generated imagery. During the {{childbirth}} scene, gas-burners were set a distance away from a fire-proof bed. The scene was then filmed with a long lens to give {{the effect that the}} fire was mere inches away from the bed. Producer John Shiban said that the film crew made [...] "a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the eyes" [...] to make the scene frightening. The devil sonogram was created by using the videotape of a real sonogram of a crew member's wife. The videotape was then edited to give it a demonic look.|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins with}} Beyoncé {{and her husband}} saying a few words, {{including}} [...] "intimacy", [...] "honesty", and [...] "commitment", and then saying the words [...] "you", [...] "me", and [...] "us" [...] together. When the action starts, Beyoncé is seen working as a police officer. Her husband (played by NFL player Eddie Goines) is very supportive. He makes her breakfast, spends time at work looking for a present for her and forgoes socializing with attractive coworkers so he can be available when his wife arrives home. However, Beyoncé is not thinking about him at all. Instead, she spends her free time with other officers, particularly her male partner, whom she seems enamored with. Her husband calls her, but she ignores the phone. Later, when her husband gives her earrings, she puts them on to go dancing with her partner at a party. Her husband is upset when he sees them, and when he confronts her about this, she acts like he is making a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> nothing. [...] "When you act like that, I don't think you realize how it makes me look or feel", he tells her. Beyoncé then asks him in a condescending tone, [...] "Why are you so jealous? It's not like I'm sleeping with the guy." [...] Then the story reverses, and Beyoncé starts to cry. Her husband's situation is actually her experience—he is a police officer who takes his supportive wife for granted.|$|E

2500|$|The team {{originally}} used American football commentators, but we {{were asked}} to make [...] "everything more British," [...] so they hired English actor Hugh Dennis to perform the voice of Ralph and ex-footballer Ray Wilkins to perform the voice of Tony; Robinson recalled that Dennis' [...] "Eddie Waring-esque commentary" [...] was deliberately intended to contrasted with the [...] "dry and amusing delivery" [...] of Wilkins. Actors that were intended for the role of the Tango drinker were passed over as they did not like the idea of being slapped; the role ultimately went to an actor whose identity has not been discussed.

[...] Barack's response to the criticism was, [...] "Statements like this are made, and people try to take it out of context and make a great <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, and that isn't at all what she meant. What she meant was, this is the first time that she's been proud of the politics of America," [...] he said.

I was asked about it a lot, and I didn't really wanna make a <b>big</b> hairy <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, because I just wanted the song to speak for itself.

5000|$|In a 2015 {{interview}} with Classicrockrevisited, Gramm explains his thoughts about why Head Games sold {{less than the}} first two: [...] "The big change in the band happened after Head Games and before Foreigner 4. We were really aware that Head Games didn't sell {{nearly as much as}} the first album or Double Vision. Part of that was because of the cover. The song [...] "Head Games" [...] was banned by a lot of radio stations after the cover of the album came out. Today, that would not have even been a problem. But in the Bible Belt, the cover of the cute little girl in the boys' bathroom erasing her number off the wall... They didn't see the humor in that. It wasn't supposed to even be sexy. She was sexy....she was cute. It was just the time and the place of what she was doing that was supposed to leave the impression. She was erasing her phone number off the wall of the boys' bathroom and that's all it was. A <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> was made <b>out</b> <b>of</b> that and it really hurt our sales." ...|$|R

2500|$|Ishiro Honda {{wanted the}} theme of the movie to be a satire of the Television {{industry}} in Japan. In April 1962, TV networks and their various sponsors started producing outrageous programming and publicity stunts to grab audiences attention after two elderly viewers reportedly died at home while watching a violent wrestling match on TV. The various rating wars between the networks and banal programming that followed this event caused widespread debate over how TV would effect Japanese culture with Soichi Oya stating TV was creating [...] "a nation of 100 million idiots". Honda stated [...] "People were making a <b>big</b> <b>deal</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ratings, but my own view of TV shows was that they did not take the viewer seriously, that they took the audience for granted....so I decided to show that through my movie" [...] and [...] "the reason I showed the monster battle through the prism of a ratings war was to depict the reality of the times". Honda addressed this by having a pharmaceutical company sponsor a TV show and going to extremes for a publicity stunt for ratings by capturing a giant monster stating [...] "All a medicine company would have to do is just produce good medicines you know? But the company doesn't think that way. They think they will get ahead of their competitors if they use a monster to promote their product.". Honda would work with screenwriter Shinichi Sekizawa on developing the story stating that [...] "Back then Sekizawa was working on pop songs and TV shows so he really had a clear insight into television".|$|E
