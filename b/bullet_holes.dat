5|$|During the Siege of Sarajevo, Igman {{became part}} of the buffer zone between the belligerents of the Bosnian {{government}} and the Army of Republika Srpska. The area around the ski jumping hill saw heavy fighting during the civil war and was also used for executions by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina (ARBiH). Since, the structures have been littered with <b>bullet</b> <b>holes.</b> With the war, the hills were no longer able to be used.|$|E

His best known work is <b>Bullet</b> <b>Hole</b> (1988), {{which is a}} closeup photo of {{what appears to be}} a <b>bullet</b> <b>hole</b> wound in the scalp of a person's head, mounted on 15 light boxes. Collishaw took the original image from a pathology textbook that actually showed a wound caused by an ice pick. <b>Bullet</b> <b>Hole</b> was originally exhibited in Freeze, the group show organised by Damien Hirst in 1988 that launched the YBA (Young British Artists). It is now in the collection of the Museum of Old and New Art in Hobart, Australia.|$|R

5|$|In the Jamia Hafsa complex, {{damage was}} extensive, with {{thousands}} of <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> in the courtyard. The basement was blackened from rockets. The main buildings of the complex were structurally intact, but the boundary walls had been breached in several places. The building had bullet marks in its cement structure. The two courtyards inside the school were filled with shattered glass and spent rounds. Piles of the girls' bed rolls and stacks of books were piled against walls.|$|E
5|$|Six Flags designers' {{decorative}} theme {{attempts to}} capture the spirit of Batman's world for those queuing to board the ride. As the queue moves through Gotham City Park, the theme becomes more ominous. Modeled after Anton Furst's award-winning set design for the original Batman film, the atmosphere indicates a crime-ridden and dirty environment, with wrecked cars, discarded pieces of equipment, crumbling concrete, and a Gotham City Police car riddled with <b>bullet</b> <b>holes.</b> The queue then enters the ride structure. The ride passenger loading area is modeled on Batman's Batcave, and features {{a replica of the}} Batsuit from the 1989 film.|$|E
5|$|Though Wyatt {{received}} <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> in {{both sides}} of his long coat and another in his boot heel, he never received even a scratch from any bullet. After emptying his shotgun, Wyatt fired his pistol, mortally wounding Johnny Barnes {{in the chest and}} wounding Milt Hicks in the arm. Vermillion tried to retrieve his rifle wedged in the scabbard under his fallen horse, exposing himself to the Cowboys' gunfire. Doc Holliday helped him get to cover. Wyatt had trouble remounting his horse because his cartridge belt had slipped down his legs. He was finally able to get on his horse, and {{with the rest of the}} posse retreated.|$|E

5|$|Two {{incidents}} {{occurred during}} filming. On the first, seven <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> were shot {{into one of}} the trucks used during production. On the second, the cast and crew were driving from the set, and a pedestrian was shot in the neck outside a supermarket. The ambulance took 35–45 minutes to arrive, and waited a further 35–45 minutes for the police to arrive. The paramedics refused to take the victim to the hospital without a police escort. According to Stevenson, there was a possibility that rival gangmembers would shoot at the paramedics for trying to resuscitate the victim.|$|E
5|$|Angkor Wat {{required}} considerable restoration in the 20th century, {{mainly the}} removal of accumulated earth and vegetation. Work was interrupted by the Cambodian Civil War and Khmer Rouge {{control of the country}} during the 1970s and 1980s, but relatively little damage was done during this period. Camping Khmer Rouge forces used whatever wood remained in the building structures for firewood, a pavilion was ruined by a stray American shell, and a shoot-out between Khmer Rouge and Vietnamese forces put a few <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> in a bas relief. Far more damage was done after the wars, by art thieves working out of Thailand, which, in the late 1980s and early 1990s, claimed almost every head that could be lopped off the structures, including reconstructions.|$|E
5|$|Costello {{picks up}} the trenchcoat and shoots more {{subordinates}} who get in his way. Fung is finally the last surviving member, so he attempts to walk nonchalantly by Costello, relying on the Frenchman's inability to recognize him without the coat, but as he is walking by, Costello sees a sticker on Fung's tie. Both men shoot at each other. Fung is hit and Costello demands that he put the coat on, which Fung refuses, so Costello shoots him in the leg. Fung puts the coat on, Costello checks the <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> in the coat and sees that they align with the bullets stuck in the bullet-proof vest he was wearing. Costello then stands up and fires a round into Fung's head killing him. Costello is last seen eating and laughing with the woman and children.|$|E

5|$|In early May 2012, five alleged {{members of}} the Abergil {{organization}} who were suspected of conspiring {{to commit a crime}} and possessing deadly weapons were arrested in Jerusalem, after police had found a weapons cache inside a storage room in an apartment building in Jerusalem where one of the suspects' parents live. According to the suspects, they followed the advice of Itzhak Abergil to hide weapons in public buildings in order to deflect suspicion from the organization. At the suspects’ homes police discovered signs of violence, including ceramic bulletproof vests with <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> in them. The police suspects that the organization was planning a major attack. According to the suspects, they were planning to take revenge on a Jerusalem resident, who owed the organization money.|$|E
5|$|On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came {{face-to-face}} against 80 gunmen {{which became}} known as the Frisco shootout. The battle started when Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him. In turn the cowboy called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and {{over the course of a}} 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed. Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945, age 80.|$|E
5|$|The Buffalo Grove ambush was {{an ambush}} that {{occurred}} on May 19, 1832 {{as part of}} the Black Hawk War. A six-man detail carrying dispatches from United States Colonel James M. Strode at Galena, Illinois to General Henry Atkinson at Dixon's Ferry was ambushed by Native Americans during the attack. William Durley was killed and buried near the site of the ambush. Durley's remains were initially interred by the party that would become victims of the St. Vrain massacre. Two other men had <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> in their clothing, but were uninjured. In 1910 the Polo Historical Society moved Durley's remains to a plot beneath a memorial they erected west of Polo, Illinois.|$|E

5|$|The {{men at the}} Plum River {{settlement}} waited {{overnight and}} then fled to Galena where they reported the incident to Colonel James M. Strode. He ordered a militia party to the settlement to secure the it {{and make sure the}} attackers were dealt with accordingly. When the detachment arrived at Savanna they found no Native Americans, and plenty of <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> from the battle. The group continued to Fort Armstrong, where they picked up supplies, and returned to Galena without incident. On June 1, then-Colonel Zachary Taylor expressed his concerns about recent events, including the Plum River raid in a letter to General Henry Atkinson. He stated that there had no doubt been an attack at the settlement, but no one was killed and the site abandoned since.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{was lucky}} during the few gun fights he {{took part in}} from his {{earliest}} job as an assistant police officer in Wichita to Tombstone, where he was briefly deputy U.S. marshal. Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, Wyatt was never wounded, although once his clothing and his saddle were shot through with <b>bullet</b> <b>holes.</b> According to John H. Flood's biography (as dictated to him by Wyatt Earp), Wyatt vividly recalled a presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action. This happened {{when he was on}} the street, alone in his room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, at Bob Hatch's Pool Hall, where he went moments before Morgan was assassinated, and again when he approached Iron Springs and surprised Curly Bill Brocius, killing him.|$|E
5|$|It {{is notable}} for a carved roof, with lions {{and a small}} cider barrel purportedly carved by the monks of Muchelney Abbey. Sir John Betjeman was also {{inspired}} by an inscription on the candelabra. The church is quite plain on the outside but inside {{is one of the}} finest wooden carved roofs in the county. It is shallow pitched with massive, richly decorated tie beams and short king posts. The whole area of the roof is divided into square carved panels set in the framework of the structural timbers which are decorated with carved bosses where they intersect. There are 640 panels each carved with the same quatrefoil design. In the triangular spaces above each beam are dragon-like beasts. It is said there are <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> in the timbers, caused by soldiers who camped in the church in 1646 before the Battle of Langport. The 17th century pulpit and altar table are Jacobean woodwork. There are five other churches in the town, including Catholic and Methodist groups.|$|E

5|$|The {{first major}} {{achievement}} for PLOT was the award-winning VM Houses in Ørestad, Copenhagen, in 2005. Inspired by Le Corbusier's Unité d'Habitation concept, they designed two residential blocks, {{in the shape}} of the letters V and M (as seen from the sky); the M House with 95 units, was completed in 2004, and the V House, with 114 units, in 2005. The design places strong emphasis on daylight, privacy and views. Rather than looking over the neighboring building, all of the apartments have diagonal views of the surrounding fields. Corridors are short and bright, rather like open <b>bullet</b> <b>holes</b> through the building. There are some 80 different types of apartment in the complex, adaptable to individual needs. The building garnered Ingels and Smedt the Forum AID Award for the best building in Scandinavia in 2006. Ingels lived in the complex until 2008 when he moved into the adjacent Mountain Dwellings.|$|E
5|$|The game {{features}} heavy {{emphasis on}} environmental destruction using a procedural destruction system. Players can break structures by planting explosives on them, or shoot walls to make <b>bullet</b> <b>holes.</b> Players may gain tactical advantages through environmental destruction, and the system aims at encouraging players to utilize creativity and strategy. A bullet-penetration system is featured, in which bullets that pass through structures deal less damage to enemies. In addition to destruction, players can also set up heavy-duty fortifications on walls and deployable shields around them for protection; these can be destroyed through breaching or by utilizing operator specific melee-weapons like sledgehammers. In order to stop attackers' advance, defenders can place traps like barbed-wire and explosive laserwire traps around the maps. Vertical space is a key gameplay element in the game's maps: players can destroy ceilings and floors using breach charges and can ambush enemies by rappelling through windows. Powerful weapons like grenades and breach charges are valuable, as only limited numbers {{can be used in}} a round.|$|E
5|$|By mid-June, III./JG52 {{was back}} {{together}} in Bucharest and re-equipped with the new, more powerful Bf109F-4 model. The Gruppe {{was not involved}} in most of the fighting in the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa as it was once again kept back to defend Ploiești and the Romanian ports from Soviet bombers. The pilots’ mood was not helped when Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, the commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, criticised the unit on 4 July for its lack of success compared to virtually all the other Jagdgruppen. On 1 August, after German advances had removed the threat of Soviet air attacks on Romania, the unit was transferred to the front line and the major Luftwaffe airbase at Belaya Zerkov in the Ukraine south of Kiev. Graf achieved his first victory {{in the early hours of}} 4 August when his squadron was escorting a Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombing strike, shooting down one of a pair of attacking Polikarpov I-16 fighters. Despite his success, he was reprimanded by his squadron leader, because he had broken formation and forgotten to arm his guns before firing. His second victory was achieved the next day, although Graf was lucky to get away unscathed – landing his aircraft riddled with <b>bullet</b> <b>holes.</b>|$|E
