5|$|The {{majority}} {{of her career}} was spent at Cambridge's Molteno Institute for Parasite Biology, where she returned in 1929. Her work there was an extension of her research with Dobell, as she studied nuclear division in parasitic flagellates and amoebae of diverse species, including both vertebrates and invertebrates. She isolated one type of protozoan, aerotolerant anaerobes, from the digestive tract of Haemopis sanguisuga during this period. Bishop also discovered a new species, Pseudotrichomonas keilini, which she named to acknowledge her colleague David Keilin, {{as well as the}} parasite's resemblance to the genus Trichomonas. Her research at Manchester with H.P. Baynon concerned the identification, isolation, and study of the turkey <b>blackhead</b> parasite (Histomonas meleagridis); this study pioneered a technique for isolating and growing parasites from lesions on the liver. Bishop and Baynon were the first scientists to isolate Histomonas and then prove its role in <b>blackhead.</b> Bishop's expertise with parasitic protozoa translated into her best-known work, a comprehensive study of the malaria parasite (Plasmodium) and potential chemotherapies for the disease.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years into}} her {{undergraduate}} career, {{after winning the}} John Dalton Natural History Prize awarded by the University, she began work for another protozoologist, a Fellow of the Royal Society, Sydney J. Hickson. In 1932, she received her D.Sc. from Manchester University, for her work with the <b>blackhead</b> parasite. She received her Sc.D. from the University of Cambridge in 1941, though it was in title only: women were not granted full degrees from Cambridge at this time.|$|E
5|$|Acne is a {{very common}} problem, {{particularly}} during puberty in teenagers, and is thought to relate to an increased production of sebum due to hormonal factors. The increased production of sebum {{can lead to a}} blockage of the sebaceous gland duct. This can cause a comedo, (commonly called a <b>blackhead</b> or a whitehead), which can lead to infection, particularly by the bacteria Propionibacterium acnes. This can inflame the comedones, which then change into the characteristic acne lesions. Comedones generally occur on the areas with more sebaceous glands, particularly the face, shoulders, upper chest and back. Comedones may be 'black' or 'white' depending on whether the entire pilosebaceous unit, or just the sebaceous duct, is blocked. Sebaceous filaments—innocuous build-ups of sebum—are often mistaken for whiteheads.|$|E
50|$|House of the <b>Blackheads,</b> or House of the Brotherhood of Black Heads, in Tallinn, {{the capital}} of Estonia, is a former {{headquarters}} of the Brotherhood of <b>Blackheads.</b> Historically this was a professional association of ship owners, merchants and foreigners dating from the 14th century. They were active in Livonia (present-day Estonia and Latvia) but fled to Germany during the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States in 1940. The House of the <b>Blackheads</b> was visited by several Russian Emperors including Peter I, Paul I and Alexander I who also became honorable members the Brotherhood.|$|R

50|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, {{the local}} brotherhoods of <b>Blackheads</b> were {{important}} as social organizations that sponsored social events, such as parties and concerts, and collected objects of fine art. In Tallinn and Riga, {{the houses of}} the Brotherhood, along with the medieval traditions still practiced in them, became important cultural and social centers for social elites. In 1895, the Brotherhood of <b>Blackheads</b> in Tallinn was formally reconstituted into the <b>Blackheads</b> Club. The brotherhoods in Tallinn and Riga carried on in independent Estonia and Latvia {{until the beginning of}} the Soviet occupation of the Baltic States in 1940, when the occupation authorities dissolved the Brotherhood. Most of the members were able to flee to Germany, where they tried to continue their traditions. In 1961 the Brotherhood of <b>Blackheads</b> was officially registered in Hamburg, where it survives to this day.|$|R
5|$|Ann Bishop (19 December 1899– 7 May 1990) was a British {{biologist}} from Girton College at the University of Cambridge and a Fellow of the Royal Society, {{one of the}} few female Fellows of the Royal Society. She {{was born}} in Manchester but stayed at Cambridge {{for the vast majority of}} her professional life. Her specialties were protozoology and parasitology; early work with ciliate parasites, including the one responsible for <b>blackhead</b> disease in the domesticated turkey, lay the groundwork for her later research. While working towards her doctorate, Bishop studied parasitic amoebae and examined potential chemotherapies for the treatment of amoebic diseases including amoebic dysentery.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a <b>blackhead</b> or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E

25|$|Coastal scenery of a {{different}} kind may be seen in the Islandmagee area near Whitehead. While there was already some provision for tourists, the BNCR's civil engineer Berkeley Deane Wise constructed a new promenade and imported sand from Portrush to make a beach. In 1892 he also engineered a cliff path was engineered that stretched 1¼ miles from Whitehead to the <b>Blackhead</b> promontory. The lower sections bordered the shore but blasting and cantilevering from the cliffs was necessary higher up.|$|E

The roads up the cloves were paved to accommodate the then-new automobile. Since guests could then more easily reach the newer resorts further into the mountains, the Mountain House continued to suffer. The incline railroad was shut down in 1918. When the Hotel Kaaterskill burned down in 1924, it was not rebuilt.|$|E

50|$|House of the <b>Blackheads</b> (Melngalvju nams, Schwarzhäupterhaus) is a {{building}} {{situated in the}} old town of Riga, Latvia. The original building was erected during the first third of the 14th century for the Brotherhood of <b>Blackheads,</b> a guild for unmarried German merchants in Riga. Major works were done in the years 1580 and 1886, adding most of the ornamentations.|$|R
25|$|Most of the Escarpment, {{including}} all its mountaintops and ridges, has been {{acquired by the}} state and added to the Forest Preserve, requiring that it be kept forever wild. Private land is found only in the cloves, where some of it is also protected. The Forest Preserve lands are divided into management units by the state Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). Initially all of the state lands save North-South Lake Public Campground were classified as Wild Forests, a protection level unique to New York that is slightly less restrictive than wilderness. In 2008 an updated Catskill State Land Master Plan combined the North Mountain, Windham High Peak and <b>Blackhead</b> Range Wild Forests into one new unit, the Windham-Blackhead Range Wilderness. Two old roads through the Escarpment were also given a new classification, Primitive Bicycle Corridor, to accommodate mountain bikes.|$|E
25|$|Graham and Doubletop mountains, Balsam Lake's higher {{neighbors to}} the east, {{dominate}} {{the view from the}} fire tower, with Slide, the highest Catskill peak, between them in clear weather. In the best of conditions the <b>Blackhead</b> Range at the northeast corner of the Catskills is visible as well. To the north Dry Brook Ridge appears as a single peak rather than a long ridge, with Bearpen, highest peak in New York outside the Forest Preserve, visible in clear weather. Westward Woodpecker Ridge and the eastern summit of Mill Brook Ridge are closest, and in the distance the view looks down on the lower peaks in eastern Delaware County, with Mount Pisgah, home to Ski Bobcat, standing out above most of them. South the view takes in the Beaver Kill Range, with Peekamoose, Table and Red Hill and its fire tower also visible. In clear weather the Shawangunk Ridge is also visible to the southeast, and Elk Mountain, highest peak in Northeastern Pennsylvania, is on the southwest horizon.|$|E

2500|$|The Escarpment {{has many}} hiking trails. Foremost {{among them is}} the [...] Escarpment Trail, which begins at Schutt Road just outside the {{campground}} gate. From there it goes north to Route 23, climbing over Stoppel Point, <b>Blackhead</b> and Windham High Peak along the way. All but the southernmost [...] are also part of the Long Path long-distance trail, which itself traverses Kaaterskill High Peak and descends Kaaterskill Clove to near Palenville and then reascends to join the Escarpment Trail. Backpackers starting near Woodstock can use the trail up that mountain to hike the entire Escarpment, connecting to the Long Path between Indian Head and Plattekill mountains.|$|E
2500|$|Originally named Greenland Mountain, in {{the mid-19th}} century the {{mountain}} was renamed. Like {{the town and the}} village, Hunter takes its name from John Hunter, a somewhat despised local landlord. It is not known when the mountain was first climbed, or by whom. A popular local legend has it that Hunter, or some other later landowner, went to the summit with a hand level in order to be sure they had indeed purchased the Catskills' highest peak, and were satisfied until an [...] "unknown" [...] peak appeared on the southern horizon — Slide Mountain, the range's true highest peak but not identified as such until 1886 (which makes this legend unlikely to have any basis in fact, as the necessary clearing at the summit for the fire tower was made well afterwards). For a time before Arnold Henry Guyot identified Slide, either Hunter or nearby Black Dome, central peak of the <b>Blackhead</b> Mountains, was thought to be the range's highest, in contrast to the claims of nearby hoteliers for Kaaterskill High Peak.|$|E
