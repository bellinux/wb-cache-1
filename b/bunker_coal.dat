25|$|The {{papers of}} the day {{described}} the new ship as 320ft long, 44ft broad, and 28ft 8.5 in deep. On deck there was accommodation for 90 saloon and 40 second saloon passengers. This was later reported as 150 saloon and 46 second saloon passengers. She {{was to have a}} speed of 12.5 knots at sea on a draught of 12ft. The total capacity on a draught of 21ft will be 3500 tons, including <b>bunker</b> <b>coal.</b> She was built of steel of the highest class of the British Corporation Registry and under their special survey. The propulsion was two triple-expansion engines. The vessel was built under the supervision of Captain Cameron, Marine Superintendent of the company. At her sea trials near Skelmorlie on the Firth of Clyde she attained 15 knots.|$|E

60|$|The last {{good-bye to}} the wife had been at Cardiff, twenty-eight months before, when he sailed for Valparaiso with coals--nine {{thousand}} tons and down to his marks. From Valparaiso {{he had gone to}} Australia, light, a matter of six thousand miles on end with a stormy passage and running short of <b>bunker</b> <b>coal.</b> Coals again to Oregon, seven thousand miles, and nigh as many more with general cargo for Japan and China. Thence to Java, loading sugar for Marseilles, and back along the Mediterranean to the Black Sea, and on to Baltimore, down to her marks with crome ore, buffeted by hurricanes, short again of <b>bunker</b> <b>coal</b> and calling at Bermuda to replenish. Then a time charter, Norfolk, Virginia, loading mysterious contraband coal and sailing for South Africa under orders of the mysterious German supercargo put on board by the charterers. On to Madagascar, steaming four knots by the supercargo's orders, and the suspicion forming that the Russian fleet might want the coal. Confusion and delays, long waits at sea, international complications, the whole world excited over the old Tryapsic and her cargo of contraband, and then on to Japan and the naval port of Sassebo. Back to Australia, another time charter and general merchandise picked up at Sydney, Melbourne, and Adelaide, and carried on to Mauritius, Lourenco Marques, Durban, Algoa Bay, and Cape Town. To Ceylon for orders, and from Ceylon to Rangoon to load rice for Rio Janeiro. Thence to Buenos Aires and loading maize for the United Kingdom or the Continent, stopping at St. Vincent, to receive orders to proceed to Dublin. Two years and four months, eight hundred and fifty days by the log, steaming up and down the thousand-league-long sea-lanes and back again to Dublin town. And he was well aweary.|$|E

50|$|Given the {{evidence}} from the officers of the Harlow (see above), it has been speculated that the Waratah was destroyed by a sudden explosion {{in one of her}} <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers.</b> <b>Coal</b> dust can certainly self-combust and in the right proportions of air be explosive. However, no single bunker explosion would cause a ship the size of the Waratah to sink instantly, without anyone being able to launch a lifeboat or raft, and without leaving any wreckage.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the rear}} <b>bunker</b> carried only <b>coal,</b> an {{additional}} large underbelly water tank under the boiler {{compensated for the}} resulting diminished water capacity. All the engine's water was carried in the front bunker tank and in the underbelly water tank, with a combined capacity of 6000 imp gal, while the rear <b>bunker</b> had a <b>coal</b> capacity of 13 lt 10 lcwt t.

50|$|Although a {{mixed use}} dock, {{with one of}} the {{original}} transit sheds still in place, Bramley-Moore did extensive coal trade. The coal handling included both coal for export and <b>bunker</b> <b>coal</b> for steamships in the port, transported from the South Lancashire Coalfield. A high-level railway opened in 1857 to transport coal directly to the quayside. The high-level railway was connected by viaduct to the adjacent Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway line. The high-level railway was operational from 1856 to 1966.|$|E
50|$|Established in 1919 by Francis H. and Richard B. Weeks, {{the company}} started with two cranes in the Port of New York, {{handling}} <b>bunker</b> <b>coal</b> and dry ballast. By {{the beginning of}} World War II, they had purchased their seventh crane and were loading military equipment bound for Europe to support the Allied Forces. The workload of the war overseas had taken its toll on the Weeks fleet, so after WWII, the wooden hulls of the cranes were replaced with steel hulls, creating the Weeks #6 and #7.|$|E

50|$|Coal was {{delivered}} to the station's coal plant, which {{has the capacity to}} hold up to 900,000 tonnes of coal on a storage bing. The coal plant and storage bing are situated {{on the opposite side of}} B1348 road between Prestonpans and Cockenzie and Port Seton, and the main station. The coal, known as 'raw coal' at this stage was weighed, sampled and screened for metal and stones before being transported to the main station and stored in <b>bunkers.</b> <b>Coal</b> was transported from the coal plant to storage bunkers in the main station by a conveyor belt.|$|R

In about 1965 a [...] "merry-go-round" [...] system of automatic coal wagon unloading was installed to evaluate for future [...] "Stations Systems". <b>Bunker</b> <b>coal</b> supply ran from the coal plant on inclined conveyors to the boiler house, where it was fed onto a moving [...] "feed head" [...] conveyor above the individual boiler coal bunkers. The plant burnt around 10,000 tonnes of coal a day. The two chimneys were 450 ft high. A pipeline was built to take ash across the Trent five miles to former gravel pits at Besthorpe, Nottinghamshire.|$|E

50|$|General Concha {{was built}} at the naval {{shipyard}} Esteiro at Ferrol in Spain, working order #169. She had an iron hull with bow ram, a single funnel, and a light schooner rig. She was the first ship of a class of four gunboats ordered by Admiral Francisco de Paula Pavía y Pavía during his third term as Ministro de Marina (Minister of the Navy). The design was made in Spain. The keel was laid down on 1 May 1882 and the ship was launched on 28 November 1883. The 600 hp engine with two boilers was constructed by La Maquinista Terrestre y Maritima SA in Barcelona at a final cost of 312,000 pesetas and was constructed directly aboard the ship, after being towed from Ferrol to Barcelona by merchant vessel José Pérez. <b>Bunker</b> <b>coal</b> stock capacity was 70-80 tons having an average consumption of 10 tons per day.|$|E

50|$|North Sydney {{was settled}} around 1785 by European and Loyalist settlers. It {{emerged as a}} major {{shipbuilding}} centre in the early 19th century, building many brigs and brigantines for the English market, later moving on to larger barques, and in 1851 to the full-rigged Lord Clarendon, the largest wooden ship ever built in Cape Breton. Wooden shipbuilding declined in the 1860s, but the same decade saw the arrival of increasing numbers of steamships, drawn to North Sydney for <b>bunker</b> <b>coal.</b> By 1870 {{it was the fourth}} largest port in Canada dealing in ocean-going vessels, also {{due to the fact that}} The Western Union cable office had been established here in 1875. The community was incorporated as a town on April 24, 1885. The railroad came to Cape Breton Island in 1891. At this time there were 2,513 people in North Sydney, as compared to 2,417 in Sydney.|$|E
5000|$|She made a {{spectacular}} 19-day raid off the Atlantic coast {{as far north}} as Halifax, Nova Scotia. The Tallahassee destroyed 26 vessels and captured 7 others that were bonded or released. Wood sailed the Tallahassee into Halifax Harbour on August 18 to take on <b>bunker</b> <b>coal</b> and water. Neutrality laws limited her stay in Halifax to 24 hours. Tallahassee was granted an extra 12 hours to fix a broken mast but was only allowed to load enough coal {{to take her to the}} nearest Confederate port. Two Federal war ships, the USS Nansemond and , had chased her north and were believed to be waiting for the Tallahassee at the harbour entrance. Wood hired a legendary Halifax pilot John [...] "Jock" [...] Flemming, who is believed to have guided the warship through the narrow and shallow Eastern Passage between Dartmouth and Lawlor Island, a route only suited for small fishing vessels. Tallahassee succeeded in negotiating the passage out of the harbour, although no Northern warships were in fact waiting. The first Northern warship, the gunboat USS Pontoosuc, arrived at the harbour entrance several hours after the Confederate cruiser departed.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} slatted upper {{sides of}} the Type XM2 tender's <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> were soon replaced by sheet-metal sides.

50|$|Three {{locomotives}} {{were built}} in April 1927 and the remaining 30 {{were built in}} the period August to November 1930. All were built with straight sided bunkers but from 1931 all except the first two of the 1927 trio were fitted with revolving <b>coal</b> <b>bunkers.</b> These were conical in shape and were revolved and oscillated by means of a small 2-cylinder steam engine. The revolving <b>bunkers</b> prevented <b>coal</b> dust from entering the cab and the oscillation facility made them self-trimming.|$|R

50|$|The South African Railways also {{operated}} a Double Pacific {{version of the}} Union Garratt articulated locomotive. The Union Garratt was a hybrid locomotive, partly Modified Fairlie and partly Garratt. The front end was of a typical Garratt arrangement, with a water tank mounted on the front engine unit’s frame, while the rear end was constructed in the Modified Fairlie fashion, with the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker</b> mounted on a rigid extension of the locomotive’s main frame and with the pivoting rear engine unit positioned beneath the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker.</b> It had an additional large underbelly water tank under the boiler. The main frame therefore carried the smokebox, boiler, firebox, cab, <b>coal</b> <b>bunker,</b> {{as well as the}} underbelly water tank. As a result, like the Modified Fairlies, the Union Garratts were prone to metal fatigue and cracking of the frames. In the case of the Union Garratts, this occurred particularly at the rear, brought about by the long frame overhang laden with the <b>coal</b> <b>bunker.</b>|$|R
