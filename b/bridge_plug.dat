This <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> has realistic significance and practical value for improving oilfield economic benefits and provides an extensive application prospect. After setting process, the slips brace the <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> whose performance have a directly influence on the oil well productivity and production safety.

40|$|A typical {{completion}} procedure requires {{placement of}} a <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> near the liner {{top of a}} producing steam well so the well can be loaded to permit cementing of the tieback casing string by conventional cementing techniques. A drillable <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> {{has been used in}} the past so that it could be removed with a conventional toothed, cone-type drill bit. All components could not be drilled out because the <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> would separate from the casing when drilling through its top slips. This created a hazardous situation because heavy components remaining in the well could blowout after placing the well into production and damage or destroy surface equipment. A <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> and its companion milling-type retrieving tool were developed to perform the bridging operation and accomplish removal in a producing geothermal steam well environment. The <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> features an internal briding plug that is designed to permit the release of differential pressure buildup from below before releasing the <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> by milling away the top slips. The millinog-type retrieving tool has a catcher mechanism designed to function in the high-velocity steam flow of a producing well to catch the released <b>bridge</b> <b>plug.</b> After the released <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> components are caught, they may be returned to the surface in a controlled manner. This removes the massive components so {{that they will not be}} blown out by the steam of a producing well.

Examples of field usage are discussed in the paper...|$|E

The new developed tools use an alloy based on bismuth that is melted in situ using Thermite reaction. The tool uses the expansion properties of bismuth to sea the well. Testing the new technology in real field under more than 2 km deep sea water can be expensive. Virtual simulation of the new device under simulated thermal and mechanical environment can be achieved using nonlinear finite element method to validate the product and reduce cost.

40|$|The overall {{objectives}} of this CRADA were to assist Halliburton in analyzing a composite <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> {{and to determine}} why their original design was failing in the field. In Phase 1, finite element analyses were done on the original composite slip design and several alternative designs. The composite slip was the component in the <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> that was failing. The finite element code ABAQUS was used for these calculations and I-DEAS {{was used as the}} pre- and post-processor in the analyses.

In Phase 2, the objective was to develop finite element models that would accurately represent the deformations in the entire all-composite 4 - 1 / 2 ' diameter <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> assembly. The finite element code LS-DYNA was used and the results from this effort were intended to expand Halliburton's composite design and analysis capabilities with regard to developing future composite components for downhole tools.

40|$|Due to {{downhole}} complexities, shale-gas {{horizontal well}} fracturing in the Sichuan Basin suffered from casing deformation {{and failure to}} apply the technique of cable-conveyed perforation <b>bridge</b> <b>plug.</b> In view of these problems, a new technique of staged volume fracturing with temporary plugging by sand filling is employed. Based on theoretical analyses and field tests, a design of optimized parameters of coiled tubing-conveyed multi-cluster sand-blasting perforation and temporary plugging by sand filling was proposed. It was applied in the horizontal Well ZJ- 1 in which casing deformation occurred. The following results are achieved in field operations. First, this technique enables selective staged fracturing in horizontal sections. Second, this technique can realize massive staged fracturing credibly without mechanical plugging, with the operating efficiency equivalent to the conventional <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> staged fracturing. Third, full-hole is preserved after fracturing, thus {{it is possible to}} directly conduct an open flow test without time consumption of a wiper trip. The staged volume fracturing with temporary plugging by sand filling facilitated the 14 -stage fracturing in Well ZJ- 1, with similar SRV to that achieved by conventional <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> staged fracturing and higher gas yield than neighboring wells on the same well pad. Thus, a new and effective technique is presented in multi-cluster staged volume fracturing of shale gas horizontal wells...|$|E

5000|$|Setting {{tools are}} used to set {{downhole}} completion elements such as production packers or <b>bridge</b> <b>plugs.</b> Setting tools typically use the expanding gas energy from a slow burning explosive charge to drive a hydraulic piston assembly.

40|$|An {{oriented}} cluster perforating technology, which integrates both {{advantages of}} cluster and oriented perforating, will help solve {{a series of}} technical complexities in horizontal well drilling. For realizing its better application in oil and gas development, a series of technologies were developed including perforator self-weight eccentricity, matching of the electronic selective module codes with the surface program control, axial centralized contact signal transmission, and post-perforation intercluster sealing insulation. In this way, the following functions could be realized, such as cable-transmission horizontal well perforator self-weight orientation, dynamic signal transmission, reliable addressing & selective perforation and post-perforation intercluster sealing. The combined perforation and <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> or the multi-cluster perforation can be fulfilled in one trip of perforation string. As a result, the horizontal-well oriented cluster perforating technology based on cable conveying was developed. This technology was successfully applied in unconventional gas reservoir exploitation, such as shale gas and coalbed methane, with accurate orientation, reliable selective perforation and satisfactory inter-cluster sealing. The horizontal-well oriented cluster perforating technology benefits the orientation of horizontal well drilling with a definite target and direction, which provides a powerful support for the subsequent reservoir stimulation. It also promotes the fracturing fluid to sweep the principal pay zones to the maximum extent. Moreover, it is conductive {{to the formation of}} complex fracture networks in the reservoirs, making quality and efficient development of unconventional gas reservoirs possible...|$|E
40|$|A {{reference}} {{design and}} operational {{procedures for the}} disposal of high-level radioactive waste in deep boreholes have been developed and documented. The design and operations are feasible with currently available technology and meet existing safety and anticipated regulatory requirements. Objectives of the reference design include providing a baseline for more detailed technical analyses of system performance and serving {{as a basis for}} comparing design alternatives. Numerous factors suggest that deep borehole disposal of high-level radioactive waste is inherently safe. Several lines of evidence indicate that groundwater at depths of several kilometers in continental crystalline basement rocks has long residence times and low velocity. High salinity fluids have limited potential for vertical flow because of density stratification and prevent colloidal transport of radionuclides. Geochemically reducing conditions in the deep subsurface limit the solubility and enhance the retardation of key radionuclides. A non-technical advantage that the deep borehole concept may offer over a repository concept is that of facilitating incremental construction and loading at multiple perhaps regional locations. The disposal borehole would be drilled to a depth of 5, 000 m using a telescoping design and would be logged and tested prior to waste emplacement. Waste canisters would be constructed of carbon steel, sealed by welds, and connected into canister strings with high-strength connections. Waste canister strings of about 200 m length would be emplaced in the lower 2, 000 m of the fully cased borehole and be separated by <b>bridge</b> and cement <b>plugs.</b> Sealing of {{the upper part of the}} borehole would be done with a series of compacted bentonite seals, cement plugs, cement seals, cement plus crushed rock backfill, and <b>bridge</b> <b>plugs.</b> Elements of the reference design meet technical requirements defined in the study. Testing and operational safety assurance requirements are also defined. Overall, the results of the reference design development and the cost analysis support the technical feasibility of the deep borehole disposal concept for high-level radioactive waste...|$|R
40|$|Abstractâ€”When acid {{is pumped}} into damaged {{reservoirs}} for damage removal/stimulation, distorted inflow of acid into the formation occurs caused by acid preferentially traveling into highly permeable regions over low permeable regions, or (in general) {{into the path}} of least resistance. This can lead to poor zonal coverage and hence warrants diversion to carry out an effective placement of acid. Diversion is desirably a reversible technique of temporarily reducing the permeability of high perm zones, thereby forcing the acid into lower perm zones. The uniqueness of each reservoir can pose several challenges to engineers attempting to devise optimum and effective diversion strategies. Diversion techniques include mechanical placement and/or chemical diversion of treatment fluids, further sub-classified into ball sealers, <b>bridge</b> <b>plugs,</b> packers, particulate diverters, viscous gels, crosslinked gels, relative permeability modifiers (RPMs), foams, and/or the use of placement techniques, such as coiled tubing (CT) and the maximum pressure difference and injection rate (MAPDIR) methodology. It is not always realized that the effectiveness of diverters greatly depends on reservoir properties, such as formation type, temperature, reservoir permeability, heterogeneity, and physical well characteristics (e. g., completion type, well deviation, length of treatment interval, multiple intervals, etc.). This paper reviews the mechanisms by which each variety of diverter functions and discusses the effect of various reservoir properties on the efficiency of diversion techniques. Guidelines are recommended to help enhance productivity from zones of interest by choosing the best methods of diversion while pumping an optimized amount of treatment fluid. The success of an overall acid treatment often depends on the effectiveness of the diverting agents. Keywordsâ€”Acid treatment, carbonate, diversion, sandstone...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{the course}} of {{completion}} of an ultra-deep well newly drilled in the Yuanba Gasfield, Sichuan Basin, long-section and large-scale deformation occurred in the heavy casing section and nickel base alloy casing section of the sealing Triassic limestone interval, so a new hole had to be sidetracked, which impels us to rediscover the applicability of conventional drilling and completion technology in ultra-deep wells. In this paper, based on the borehole condition and field operation data of this well, the borehole pressure field variation initiated by lost circulation in the low-pressure formation was analyzed {{from the perspective of}} dynamics, then, the variation pattern of differential pressure inside and outside the well bore at different time intervals was depicted, and the primary cause of such complication was theoretically revealed, i. e., the pressure wave generated by instant lost circulation in low-pressure formation would result in redistribution of pressure inside the downhole confined space, and then the crush of casing in the vicinity of local low-pressure areas. Pertinent proposals for avoiding these kinds of engineering complexities were put forward: â‘  when downhole sealing casing operation is conducted in open hole completion, liner completion or perforated hole, the potential damage of lost circulation to casing should be considered; â‘¡ the downhole sealing point and sealing mode should be selected cautiously: the sealing point had better be selected in the section with good cementing quality or as close to the casing shoe as possible, and the sealing mode can be either cement plug or mechanical <b>bridge</b> <b>plug.</b> This paper finally points out that good cementing quality {{plays an important role in}} preventing this type of casing deformation...|$|E
40|$|Tubing and rods of the S. P.

The CHFR tool was successfully run and data was captured. The CHFR formation resistivity readings were compared to original open hole resistivity measurements. Separation between the original and CHFR resistivity curves indicate both swept and un-swept sand intervals. Both watered out sand intervals and those with higher remaining oil saturation have been identified. Due {{to the nature of}} these turbidite sands being stratigraphically continuous, both the swept and unswept layers have been correlated across to one of the four nearby offset shallow wells. As a result of the cased hole logging, one well was selected for a workover to recomplete and test suspected oil saturated shallow sand intervals. Well S. P. Pedro-Nepple No. 2 was plugged back with cement excluding the previously existing production interval, squeeze cemented behind casing, selectively perforated in the shallower ''Bell'' zone and placed on production to develop potential new oil reserves and increase overall well productivity.

40|$|Wells in the Bluebell {{field are}} {{typically}} completed by perforating 40 or more beds over 1, 000 to 3, 000 vertical ft, them stimulating the entire interval with hydrochloric acid. This technique {{is often referred}} to as the shot gun completion. The shot-gun technique is believed to leave many potentially productive beds damaged and/or untreated, while allowing water-bearing and low-pressure (thief) zones to communicate with the wellbore. A two-year characterization study involved detailed examination of outcrop, core, well logs, surface and subsurface fractures, produced oil-field waters, engineering parameters of the two demonstration wells, and analysis of past completion techniques and effectiveness. The study was intended to improve the geologic characterization of the producing formations and thereby develop completion techniques specific to the producing beds or facies instead of a shot gun approach to stimulating all the beds. The characterization did not identify predictable-facies or predictable-fracture trends within the vertical stratigraphic column as originally hoped. Advanced logging techniques can identify productive beds in individual wells. A field-demonstration program was developed to use cased-hole advanced logging techniques in two wells and recompletion the wells at two different scales based on the logging. The first well was going to be completed at the interval scale using a multiple stage completion technique (about 500 ft per stage).

40|$|The Rocky Mountain Oilfield Testing Center (RMOTC) has {{recently}} completed two tests of a high-energy gas fracturing system {{being developed by}} Western Technologies of Crossville, Tennessee. The tests involved the use of two active wells located at the Naval Petroleum Reserve No. 3 (NPR- 3), thirty-five miles north of Casper, Wyoming (See Figure 1). During the testing process the delivery and operational system was enhanced by RMOTC, Western Technologies, and commercial wireline subcontractors. RMOTC has assisted an industrial client in developing their technology for high energy gas fracturing to a commercial level. The modifications and improvements implemented during the technology testing process are instrumental in all field testing efforts at RMOTC. The importance of well selection can also be critical in demonstrating {{the success of the}} technology. To date, significant increases in well productivity have been clearly proven in well 63 -TPX- 10. Gross fluid production was initially raised by a factor of three.

40|$|Part 1 of {{this report}} focuses on results of the western Kentucky carbon storage test, and {{provides}} a basis for evaluating injection and storage of supercritical CO{sub 2 } in Cambro-Ordovician carbonate reservoirs throughout the U. S. Midcontinent. This test demonstrated that the Cambro- Ordovician Knox Group, including the Beekmantown Dolomite, Gunter Sandstone, and Copper Ridge Dolomite in stratigraphic succession from shallowest to deepest, had reservoir properties suitable for supercritical CO{sub 2 } storage in a deep saline reservoir hosted in carbonate rocks, and that strata with properties sufficient for long-term confinement of supercritical CO{sub 2 } {{were present in the}} deep subsurface. Injection testing with brine and CO{sub 2 } was completed in two phases. The first phase, a joint project by the Kentucky Geological Survey and the Western Kentucky Carbon Storage Foundation, drilled the Marvin Blan No. 1 carbon storage research well and tested the entire Knox Group section in the open borehole ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ including the Beekmantown Dolomite, Gunter Sandstone, and Copper Ridge Dolomite ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ at 1152 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ 2255 m, below casing cemented at 1116 m. During Phase 1 injection testing, most of the 297 tonnes of supercritical CO{sub 2 } was displaced into porous and permeable sections of the lowermost Beekmantown below 1463 m and Gunter. The wellbore was then temporarily abandoned with a retrievable <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> in casing at 1105 m and two downhole pressure-temperature monitoring gauges below the <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> pending subsequent testing. Pressure and temperature data were recorded every minute for slightly more than a year, providing a unique record of subsurface reservoir conditions in the Knox. In contrast, Phase 2 testing, this study, tested a mechanically-isolated dolomitic-sandstone interval in the Gunter. Operations in the Phase 2 testing program commenced with retrieval of the <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> and long-term pressure gauges, followed by mechanical isolation of the Gunter by plugging the wellbore with cement below the injection zone at 1605. 7 m, then cementing a section of a 14 -cm casing at 1470. 4 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ 1535. 6. The resultant 70. 1 -m test interval at 1535. 6 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ 1605. 7 m included nearly all of the Gunter sandstone facies. During the Phase 2 injection, 333 tonnes of CO{sub 2 } were injected into the thick, lower sand section in the sandy member of the Gunter. Following the completion of testing, the injection zone below casing at 1116 m in the Marvin Blan No. 1 well, and wellbore below 305 m was permanently abandoned with cement plugs and the wellsite reclaimed. The range of most-likely storage capacities found in the Knox in the Marvin Blan No. 1 is 1000 tonnes per surface hectare in the Phase 2 Gunter interval to 8685 tonnes per surface hectare if the entire Knox section were available including the fractured interval near the base of the Copper Ridge. By itself the Gunter lacks sufficient reservoir volume to be considered for CO{sub 2 } storage, although it may provide up to 18 % of the reservoir volume available in the Knox. Regional extrapolation of CO{sub 2 } storage potential {{based on the results of}} a single well test can be problematic, although indirect evidence of porosity and permeability can be demonstrated in the form of active saltwater-disposal wells injecting into the Knox. The western Kentucky region suitable for CO{sub 2 } storage in the Knox is limited updip, to the east and south, by the depth at which the base of the Maquoketa shale lies above the depth required to ensure storage of CO{sub 2 } in its supercritical state and the deepest a commercial well might be drilled for CO{sub 2 } storage. The resulting prospective region has an area of approximately 15, 600 km{sup 2 }, beyond which it is unlikely that suitable Knox reservoirs may be developed. Faults in the subsurface, which serve as conduits for CO{sub 2 } migration and compromise sealing strata, may mitigate the area with Knox reservoirs suitable for CO{sub 2 } storage. The results of the injection tests in the Marvin Blan No. 1, however, provide a basis for evaluating supercritical CO{sub 2 } storage in Cambro-Ordovician carbonate reservoirs throughout the Midcontinent. Reservoir seals were evaluated in the Knox and overlying strata. Within the Knox, permeabilities measured in vertical core plugs from the Beekmantown and Copper Ridge suggest that intraformational seals may problematic. Three stratigraphic intervals overlying the Knox in the Marvin Blan No. 1 well may provide seals for potential CO{sub 2 } storage reservoirs in western Kentucky: Dutchtown Limestone, Black River Group, and Maquoketa Shale. The Dutchtown and Black River had permeabilities suggest that these intervals may act as secondary sealing strata. The primary reservoir seal for the Knox, however, is the Maquoketa. Maximum seal capacity calculated from permeabilities measured in vertical core plugs from the Maquoketa exceeded the net reservoir height in the Knox by about two orders of magnitude. Rock strength measured in core plugs from the Maquoketa suggest that it is unlikely that any CO{sub 2 } migrating from the Knox would have sufficient pressure to fracture the Maquoketa. Part 2 {{of this report}} reviews the results of vertical seismic profiling in the Marvin Blan No. 1 well to model post-injection CO{sub 2 } plume migration. Two three-dimensional vertical seismic profiles (3 D-VSPÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â™s) were acquired at the Kentucky Geological Survey Marvin Blan No. 1 CO{sub 2 } sequestration research well, Hancock County, Kentucky. The initial (pre-injection) survey was performed on September 15 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ 16, 2010. This was followed by the injection of 333 tonnes of supercritical CO{sub 2 } and then 584 m 3 of 2 % KCl water (to displace the remaining CO{sub 2 } in the wellbore) on September 22, 2010. After injection, the well was shut in with a downhole pressure of 17. 5 MPa at the injected reservoir depth of 1545. 3 m. The second 3 D-VSP was acquired on September 25 ÃƒÂ¢Ã‚Â€Ã‚Â“ 26, 2010. These two 3 D-VSP's were combined to produce a time-lapse 3 D-VSP data volume in an attempt to monitor and image the subsurface changes caused by the injection. Less than optimum surface access and ambient subsurface noise from a nearby active petroleum pipeline hampered quality of the data, resulting in the inability to image the CO{sub 2 } plume in the subsurface. However, some changes in the seismic response post-injection (both wavelet character and an apparent seismic "pull-down" within the injection zone) are interpreted to be a result of the injection process and imply that the technique could still be valid under different circumstances...|$|E
40|$|The Bluebell {{field is}} {{productive}} from the Tertiary lower Green River and Colton (Wasatch) Formations of the Uinta Basin, Utah. The productive interval consists {{of thousands of}} feet of interbedded fractured clastic and carbonate beds deposited in the ancestral Lake Uinta. Wells in the Bluebell field are typically completed by perforating 40 or more beds over 1000 to 3000 vertical ft (300 - 900 m), then stimulating the entire interval with hydrochloric acid. This technique {{is often referred to}} as the shot gun completion. Completion techniques used in the Bluebell field were discussed in detail in the Second Annual Report (Curtice, 1996). The shot-gun technique is believed to leave many potentially productive beds damaged and/or untreated, while allowing water-bearing and low-pressure (thief) zones to communicate with the wellbore. A two-year characterization study involved detailed examination of outcrop, core, well logs, surface and subsurface fractures, produced oil-field waters, engineering parameters of the two demonstration wells, and analysis of past completion techniques and effectiveness. The study was intended to improve the geologic characterization of the producing formations and thereby develop completion techniques specific to the producing beds or facies instead of a shot gun approach to stimulating all the beds. The characterization did not identify predictable-facies or predictable-fracture trends within the vertical stratigraphic column as originally hoped.

These recompletion will show which logs are most effective in identifying productive beds and what scale of completion is most cost effective. The third demonstration will be the logging and completion of a new well using the logs and completion scale or technique, most effective in the previous demonstrations...|$|E
25|$|The relay's {{primary winding}} is {{supplied}} {{from the power}} systems current transformer via a <b>plug</b> <b>bridge,</b> which is called the plug setting multiplier (psm). Usually seven equally spaced tappings or operating bands determine the relays sensitivity. The primary winding {{is located on the}} upper electromagnet. The secondary winding has connections on the upper electromagnet that are energised from the primary winding and connected to the lower electromagnet. Once the upper and lower electromagnets are energised they produce eddy currents that are induced onto the metal disc and flow through the flux paths. This relationship of eddy currents and fluxes creates torque proportional to the input current of the primary winding, due to the two flux paths being out of phase by 90Â°.|$|R
30|$|Even {{though the}} {{presented}} model {{does not consider}} pre-existing fractures, it still adds value {{to the study of}} wellbore strengthening. Most wellbore strengthening models focus on the investigation of <b>bridging</b> or <b>plugging</b> fractures on the wellbore. However, not all wellbores have initially well-developed fractures. In such scenarios, mudcake has an important role in stabilizing the wellbore. Field evidence is: (1) {{it is well known that}} compared with the water-based mud (WBM), the oil-based mud (OBM) usually has poor mudcake development due to minimal leak-off. As a result, lost circulation (wellbore fracturing) events occur more frequently with OBM due to the lack of mudcake. (2) Poroelasticity theory has shown that, with no mudcake, clean sandstones (with relatively high permeability) usually have lower FIP compared with silty shale (mixture of shale and sand with relatively low permeability). However, field practices have shown that lost circulation occurs more frequently in silty shales than in clean sandstones because of poor mudcake development (Ziegler and Jones 2014). In addition, theoretical studies of Tran et al. (2011) have indicated that a mudcake can increase fracture pressure by 16 %, compared to the case without mudcake. When pre-existing fractures exist, mudcake can still have an important role in preventing fluid loss, as will be discussed in Sect.Â  5.|$|R
40|$|As {{the demand}} for {{hydrocarbons}} increases, the oil companies are forced to start {{oil and gas exploration}} in complicated and remote fields. When drilling such environment, the requirement for safety, reliability and operational efficiency of down hole tools is vital. An evaluation of different drill pipe convoyed seal plugs is performed with respect to plug features, benefits,operational procedure and limitations. A comparison based on the different plug design and a review of applications for such plugs is made. Design requirements stated in ISO 14310 :Petroleum and Natural Gas Industries, Downhole Equipment, Packers and <b>Bridge</b> <b>Plugs,</b> is presented and related challenges and technology gaps discussed. An investigation of plug failure and reason for failure between January 2009 and March 2010 is carried out. Normally, down hole seal plugs uses an elastomeric sealing element to provide the seal against the casing wall. The plugs are rated to different temperatures and pressures due to the variation {{in the design of the}} elastomeric sealing element. When operating with elastomers, proper material selection is important to construct a wide performance envelop of the seal,making the seal more flexible with respect to working area. A possible new technology for down hole sealing application is metal-to-metal sealing. Metal-to-metal sealing shows superior seal reliability compared conventional a resilient elastomer seal with respect to pressure and temperature rating. This technology may become the new solution to provide a seal with ahigh integrity level in extreme well environments. This technology is new, and does not meet the requirements stated in ISO 14310. V 0 qualication is required for casing plugs acting as a secondary well barrier used by Statoil. The survey of application utilizing drill pipe convoyed seal plugs shows the most common application for casing suspensions plugs is to act as a secondary well barrier and to provide a gas tight seal for temporary abandonment of the wellbore when pulling the blow out preventer and the marine drilling riser. The present plugs used by Statoil shows good reliability and are efficient in use. However,limitations are seen when operating in extreme wells with difficult well trajectories. An improvement in design on plugs to be used in such wells is to make the plug able to be set and retrieved without rotation, making control of the applied forces on the plug more easily. The investigation of plug failure shows a decrease in failure trend after the implementation of ISO 14310 in 2005. In the time period investigated, a total of 350 plug runs where performed with a recorded failure rate of 9 %. The main reason of failure in this period is pressure test failure of the plug, making up 57 % of the reason of failure. Before the ISO 14310 become operative the main area of failure was when latching on the running/retrieving tool to the plug. </p...|$|R
40|$|Well ER-EC- 14 was drilled for the U. S. Department of Energy, National Nuclear Security Administration Nevada Site Office {{in support}} of the Nevada Environmental Management Operations Underground Test Area (UGTA) Activity at the Nevada National Security Site (NNSS; {{formerly}} Nevada Test Site), Nye County, Nevada. The well was drilled in September and October 2012, as part of the Central and Western Pahute Mesa Corrective Action Unit Phase II drilling program. The primary purpose of the well was to provide detailed hydrogeologic information for the Fortymile Canyon composite hydrostratigraphic unit in the Timber Mountain moat area, within the Timber Mountain caldera complex, that will help address uncertainties within the Pahute Mesaâ€“Oasis Valley hydrostratigraphic framework model. The main 55. 9 -centimeter (cm) hole was drilled to a total depth of 325. 5 meters (m) and cased with 40. 6 -cm casing to 308. 1 m. The hole diameter was then decreased to 37. 5 cm, and drilling continued to a total depth of 724. 8 m. The completion casing string, set to the depth of 690. 9 m, consists of 16. 8 -cm stainless-steel casing hanging from 19. 4 -cm carbon-steel casing. The stainless-steel casing has two slotted intervals open to the Rainier Mesa Tuff. Two piezometer strings were installed in Well ER-EC- 14. Both piezometer strings, each with one slotted interval, consist of 6. 0 -cm carbon-steel tubing at the surface, then cross over to 7. 3 -cm stainless-steel tubing just above the water table. The shallow piezometer string was landed at 507. 8 m, and the deep piezometer string was landed at 688. 6 m. Both piezometer strings are set to monitor groundwater within moderately to densely welded Rainier Mesa Tuff. Data collected during and shortly after hole construction include composite drill cuttings samples collected every 3. 0 m, various geophysical logs, water quality (including tritium and other radionuclides) measurements, and water level measurements. The well penetrated 15. 2 m of alluvium and 709. 6 m of Tertiary volcanic rocks. The stratigraphy and general lithology were not as expected due to the position of Well ER-EC- 14 relative to the buried caldera margins of the Timber Mountain caldera complex. The well is located inside the Rainier Mesa caldera, but outside the younger Ammonia Tanks caldera. On November 5, 2012, a preliminary fluid level in the shallow piezometer string was measured at the depth of 311. 8 m. This water level depth was taken before installation of the <b>bridge</b> <b>plug</b> (to be placed within the main completion casing to separate the two slotted zones). Well development, hydrologic testing, and sampling, will be conducted at a later date. No tritium above levels detectable by field methods were encountered in this hole. All Fluid Management Plan (FMP) requirements for Well ER-EC- 14 were met. Analysis of monitoring samples and FMP confirmatory samples indicated that fluids generated during drilling at Well ER-EC- 14 met the FMP criteria for discharge to an unlined sump or designated infiltration area. All sanitary and hydrocarbon waste generated was properly handled and disposed of...|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued that the size and {{technology}} of these revisions was so great that the credit for its design should go to Barlow and Hawkshaw. The towers remained in rough stone, rather than being finished in the Egyptian style. Work on the bridge was restarted in 1862. Initially a temporary bridge was created by pulling ropes across the gorge and making a footway of wire ropes with wood planks held together with iron hoops. This was used by the workers to move a [...] "traveller", consisting of a light frame on wheels, to transport each link individually, which would eventually make up the chains supporting the bridge. The chains are anchored in tapering tunnels, [...] long, {{on either side of the}} <b>bridge</b> and <b>plugs</b> of Staffordshire blue brick infilled to prevent the chains being pulled out of the narrower tunnel mouth. After completion of the chains, vertical suspension rods were hung from the links in the chains and large girders hung from these. The girders on either side then support the deck, which is [...] higher at the Clifton end than at Leigh Woods so that it gives the impression of being horizontal. The strength of the structure was tested by spreading 500tons of stone over the bridge. This caused it to sag by , but within the expected tolerances. During this time a tunnel was driven through the rocks on the Leigh Woods side beneath the bridge to carry the Bristol Port Railway to Avonmouth. The construction work was completed in 1864â€“111 years after a bridge at the site was first planned.|$|R
50|$|After {{defeating}} Zeruel, the Unit 01 undergoes {{several more}} changes, growing energy wings from its core and gaining {{the ability to}} <b>bridge</b> the entry <b>plug</b> to the Angel's core. After absorbing Zeruel's core, Unit 01 undergoes a transformation into a glowing energy being, as a divine entity equal to God, a 'radiant giant' with 'wings of light' extending upwards into a vortex {{at the center of}} multi-colored concentric circles (confirmed in 3.0 as the Doors of Guf), similar to the Adams seen during Second Impact. The mere existence of the awakened Eva-01 triggers a phenomenon confirmed in Evangelion 3.0 to have been (Near) Third Impact. It also seems that the Eva's awakening triggered by Rei and Shinji seems to have been planned from the beginning by Gendo, Shinji's father. While the Impact is aborted by Kaworu Nagisa in the Mark.06 impaling Unit 01 with the Spear of Cassius, it still results in the devastation of the entire planet, prompting the UN to seal Unit 01 into a tesseract they subsequently launch into space where it remains for the next fourteen years.|$|R
40|$|Signal {{transduction}} in the archaeon Halobacterium salinarum {{is mediated}} by thirteen soluble and membrane-bound transducers. Phototaxis in H. salinarum is processed via two signaling complexes: sensory rhodopsin I photoreceptor-Htrl phototransducer (SRIÂ­ Htrl) and sensory rhodopsin II photoreceptor-Htrll phototransducer (SRll-Htrll). Unlike the Htrl phototransducer, the Htrll phototransducer contains a large periplasmic domain-a classic feature of bacterial chemotransducers. Thus {{the existence of}} a periplasmic domain in the Htrll phototransducer suggests that Htrll is not only involved in phototaxis, but also in chemotaxis. To test this hypothesis, we developed an agarose-inÂ­ <b>plug</b> <b>bridge</b> assay to study chemotaxis in H. salinarum by detecting the density of cells around a solidified agarose plug containing chemoeffectors. The role of Htrll as a chemotransducer was studied by using this assay with overexpressed and deleted Htrll strains to all essential amino acids. The deleted Htrll strain showed little chemotactic response to the agarose plug containing 10 mM L-serine compared to the overexpressed Htrll strain. Htrll is the first example of a transducer involved in both phototaxis and chemotaxis...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2011 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 11, 12, and 13, 2011, Athens, Georgia. The City of Davenport, Iowa, is drained by {{two major}} stream systems - Duck Creek and Blackhawk Creek â€“ {{and a network}} of smaller streams and open channels. As {{urbanization}} increases these streams are experiencing significant and continued erosion due to extreme swings in storm flows. These flows have caused stream bank failures and channel head cutting, resulting in sediment and brush in the channel, loss of park land and residential property, threats to infrastructure such as park trails, and <b>bridge</b> and culvert <b>plugging.</b> It is expected that future water quality impairments such as turbidity and biotic impairment in the creeks {{will have to be}} addressed by the City as the MS 4 permit holder. Davenport is located in the eastern side of Iowa on the Mississippi River in the Quad Cities area, which has a combined population of about 380, 000. This project developed a stream restoration plan for 18 miles of public and private stream channel using standardized construction details to develop construction level plans and project priorities for the entire channel length. The project was completed using a rapid visual assessment of all channel reaches. The channels were walked by a team who recorded conditions and estimated channel bank recession rate according to a method developed by the Natural Resource Conservation Service. The team compiled a photographic record and field records of proposed remedial actions. At selected locations, a Rosgen Bank Erosion Hazard Index was calculated, bank pins and channel chains were installed and a cross section measured using a GPS unit. A hydrologic/ hydraulic model was also constructed using the EPA SWMM model to estimate channel velocities and shear stress and to assist in developing planning standards for undeveloped land.
