25|$|This {{temporary}} expansion expired on November 1, 2013, {{resulting in}} a relative benefit decrease for SNAP households; on average, benefits decreased by 5 percent.

25|$|Economists also {{debate the}} {{definition}} of public debt. Krugman argued in May 2010 that the debt held by the public is the right measure to use, while Reinhart has testified to the President's Fiscal Reform Commission that gross debt is the appropriate measure. The Center on <b>Budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> (CBPP) cited research by several economists supporting {{the use of the}} lower debt held by the public figure as a more accurate measure of the debt burden, disagreeing with these Commission members.|$|E
40|$|About {{fourteen}} {{per cent}} of the global burden of disease {{has been attributed to}} mental, neurological and substance use disorders. A number of initiatives have been launched in recent years to respond to this, the World Health Organisation (WHO) introduced the Mental Health Gap Action Programme (mhGAP) to address the widening gap between what is needed to provide adequate mental health services and what is currently available, especially in low and middle income countries where the gap is widest. This discussion paper will focus on mental health nursing in Kenya, a country in East Africa with a population of 42 million people. Mental illness is common in Kenya with up to twenty five per cent prevalence rates, yet mental health services are sparse at the tertiary and primary care level and mental health remains a low <b>budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>policy</b> <b>priority</b> for the government.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (p. 94 - 99) This thesis examines {{both the}} rhetoric <b>and</b> <b>policy</b> <b>priorities</b> of the United States Department of State under Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton. Through speech analysis of five speeches, {{as well as}} an examination of Department of State <b>budgets</b> <b>and</b> <b>policy</b> initiatives, this project seeks to understand to what extent Secretary Clinton has been able to institutionalize a gendered perspective within the Department of State and how she explains its importance. Utilizing development studies literature, I evaluate the extent to which Secretary Clinton has employed a feminist development model in Department of State programs directed towards women and girls in the Global South. I argue that Secretary Clinton employs traditional narratives of women's empowerment that stress paid employment and {{the role of women in}} contributing to global security. I found the language and priorities of the Department of State's <b>budgets</b> <b>and</b> <b>policy</b> initiatives to be more nuanced. Ultimately, however, the Department of State has targeted women in its foreign policy in an effort to support and maintain United States imperialism...|$|R

25|$|By 2016, the Federal City Council had {{expanded}} on its strategic plan by agreeing conduct more {{research into the}} city's problems, as well as act as a lobbyist for business before the Council of the District of Columbia. Lobbying came to the forefront due to the formation in 2001 of the DC Fiscal Policy Institute, a progressive think tank focused on local issues founded by the left-leaning Center on <b>Budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities.</b> As part of its lobbying effort, the Federal City Council sent representatives on a trade mission to China and worked to defeat a proposed paid family leave bill.|$|E
25|$|President Bush {{advocated}} the partial privatization of Social Security in 2005-2006, but was unsuccessful in achieving any reforms {{to the program}} against strong congressional resistance. His proposal would have diverted some of the payroll tax revenues that fund the program into private accounts. Critics argued that privatizing Social Security does nothing to address the long-term funding challenge facing the program. Diverting funds to private accounts would reduce available funds to pay current retirees, requiring significant borrowing. An analysis by the Center on <b>Budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> estimates that President Bush's 2005 privatization proposal would have added $1 trillion in new federal debt in its first decade of implementation and $3.5 trillion in the decade thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The {{effect of}} Reagan's 1981 tax cuts (reduced revenue {{relative}} to a baseline without the cuts) were at least partially offset by phased in Social Security payroll tax increases that had been enacted by President Jimmy Carter and the 95th Congress in 1977, and further increases by Reagan in 1983 An accounting indicated nominal tax receipts increased from $599 billion in 1981 to $1.032 trillion in 1990, an increase of 72% in current dollars. In 2005 dollars, the tax receipts in 1990 were $1.5 trillion, an increase of 20% above inflation. From 1991 to 2000, receipts increased by 90% in current dollars, or 60% in 2005 dollars. An analysis from the Center on <b>Budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> calculated that the average annual growth rate of real income-tax receipts per working-age person eventually rose over the two decades from 0.2% (1981–90) to 3.1% (1990–2001).|$|E

500|$|In 2010, David Walker, former U.S. Comptroller General {{then working}} for The Peter G. Peterson Foundation, {{stated that the}} CBO {{estimates}} {{are not likely to}} be accurate, because they were based on the assumption that the law would not change. The Center on <b>Budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> objected that Congress had a good record of implementing Medicare savings. According to their study, Congress followed through on the implementation of the vast majority of provisions enacted in the past 20years to produce Medicare savings, although not the payment reductions addressed by the annual [...] "doc fix".|$|E
500|$|An {{analysis}} by the CBO showed that the Ryan plan would not balance the budget for at least 28 years, partly because the changes in Medicare would not affect anyone older than 55. Former U.S. Comptroller General David Walker and Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, praised the budget for making tough choices. Walker believed it needed to go even further, tackling Social Security and defense spending. In contrast, David Stockman, director of the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, has declared that Ryan's budget [...] "is devoid of credible math or hard policy choices" [...] and would [...] "do nothing to reverse the nation's economic decline and arrest its fiscal collapse". Ezra Klein also criticized the budget for making [...] "unrealistic assumptions". The Center on <b>Budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> was highly critical of Ryan's budget proposal, stating that it would shift income to the wealthy while increasing poverty and inequality.|$|E

2500|$|President Obama {{established}} a budget reform commission, the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform which released a draft report in December 2010. The proposal {{is sometimes called}} the [...] "Bowles-Simpson" [...] plan after the co-chairs of the Commission. It included various tax and spending adjustments to bring long-run government tax revenue and spending into line at approximately 21% of GDP, with $4 trillion debt avoidance over 10 years. Under 2011 policies, the national debt would increase approximately $10 trillion over the 2012-2021 period, so this $4 trillion avoidance reduces the projected debt increase to $6 trillion. The Center on <b>Budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities</b> analyzed the plan and compared it to other plans in October 2012.|$|E
2500|$|Congressmen Jim Cooper (D-TN) and Steven LaTourette (R-OH) {{proposed}} a {{budget in the}} House of Representatives in March 2012. While it did not pass the House, it received bi-partisan support, with 17 votes in favor from each party. According to the BPC: [...] "...the plan would enact tax reform by lowering both the corporate and individual income tax rates and raising revenue by broadening the base. Policies are endorsed that improve {{the health of the}} Social Security program, restrain health care cost growth, control annually appropriated spending, and make cuts to other entitlement programs." [...] The plan proposes to raise approximately $1 trillion less revenue over the 2013-2022 decade than the Simpson-Bowles and Domenici-Rivlin plans, while cutting non-defense discretionary spending more deeply and reducing the defense spending cuts mandated in the Budget Control Act of 2011. According to the Center on <b>Budget</b> <b>and</b> <b>Policy</b> <b>Priorities,</b> this plan is ideologically to the Right of either the Simpson-Bowles or Domenici-Rivlin plans.|$|E
