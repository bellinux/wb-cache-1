In particular, Vint in 1931 formulated the first master plan for any Park Service unit, at Mount Rainier National Park, which would be established as a <b>basic</b> <b>planning</b> principle {{from that point on}} for every park. One of the principles established in this study was the specific designation of certain park areas as wilderness.|$|E

50|$|The {{games were}} awarded to Montreal {{in part as}} an {{experiment}} {{to see if it}} is possible to hold the championships in North America. The lack of exposure for these sports in North America resulted in very low sponsorship rates. The organizing committee could not meet basic levels of commercial sponsorship in the year before 2005, resulting in lack of government funding that depended on commercial sponsorship levels. In the end, although <b>basic</b> <b>planning</b> had been completed, and some construction was underway, FINA determined that the organizing committee was unable to meet the commitment to host the games.|$|E

Under the Studio 2B programs, girls were able to work on traditional badges as well as Studio 2B activities, and the Silver Award and Gold Award requirements were rewritten to require both. Studio 2B activities differed from badges in two ways: each booklet focused on topics such as environmentalism or self-confidence rather than being; and to earn each Studio 2B charm, the Girl Scout had to choose activities from the booklet and then meet a goal relevant to the booklet topic. She would create her own plan for achieving her goal, following a <b>basic</b> <b>planning</b> procedure called SMART (specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, timely).|$|E

5000|$|While {{much of the}} United States' {{nuclear war}} {{planning}} process remains classified, some information on the former SIOP planning process has been made public. The planning process began with the President issuing a presidential directive establishing the concepts, goal, and guidelines that provided guidance to the nuclear planners. The Secretary of Defense then used the President's guidance to produce the Nuclear Weapons Employment Policy (NUWEP) that specified <b>basic</b> <b>planning</b> assumptions, attack options, targeting objectives, types of targets, targeting constraints, and coordination with combatant commanders. The NUWEP was then used by the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) to create the [...] "Joint Strategic Capabilities Plan (JSCP), Annex C (Nuclear)." [...] This document established a more detailed and elaborate set of goals and conditions that included targeting and damage criteria {{for the use of}} nuclear weapons. The final stage in the planning process occurred when the Strategic Air Command (SAC) (from 1961 to 1992) or the United States Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) (from 1992 to 2003) took the guidance from the JSCP and created the actual nuclear war plan that becomes the SIOP. Detailed planning was carried out by the Joint Strategic Target Planning Staff (JSTPS) co-located with SAC Headquarters in Omaha, Nebraska.|$|E
5000|$|After Adolf Hitler's rise {{to power}} in Germany, the Nazi German {{government}} sought to inflame nationalistic tensions in neighbouring Czechoslovakia, and Hitler instructed local Nazi leader Konrad Henlein, {{the leader of the}} German minority in the Czech borderlands, to make unreasonable demands on the Czech government and to attempt to paralyse the Czechoslovak democracy. Ethnic German nationalists backed by Hitler demanded the union of German-speaking districts with Germany. At the height of Western Appeasement of Nazi Germany, the British and French-backed Munich Agreement granted the German areas, including all of the crucial Czechoslovak border fortifications, to Germany. Despite the Czech-French alliance, Czech officials were not invited to negotiate and were informed of the agreement only after its conclusion. The defenceless Czechoslovak state was forced to give up one third of Slovakia to Hungary, and the Těšínsko area, containing the only railway between the Czech lands and Slovakia, to Poland. The Czechoslovak leadership fled to London and several months later Hitler seized the rest of Czechoslovakia. During the German occupation of Czechoslovakia, the occupants destroyed the Czechoslovak state, the only Central European parliamentary democracy, and sought to [...] "reintegrate" [...] Bohemia and Moravia into the Nazi empire. This Nazi German policy took the form of so-called Grundplanung OA (<b>Basic</b> <b>planning)</b> from the summer of 1938, which included extermination of Czech nation, and later the genocidal Generalplan Ost.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{parliamentary}} election of May 1935, the SdP with 1,249,534 (15.2%) {{of the votes}} became the strongest of all parties in Czechoslovakia. The party had won about 68% of the German votes, thus surpassing the German Social Democratic Workers Party, the German Christian Social People's Party and the Farmers' League. Meanwhile, the influence exerted by the German Nazi dictatorship became stronger and after 1935 several groups within the party were financed by Germany. In November 1937 Adolf Hitler openly declared - according to the Hossbach Memorandum - his intention to separate the Sudetenland from the Czechoslovak state. The SdP officially coordinated this policy with Nazi leaders in order to integrate the German-speaking parts of Bohemia and Moravia into the German Reich. After the Austrian Anschluss Henlein first met Hitler on 28 March 1938. His policy was the so-called [...] "Grundplanung OA" [...] (<b>Basic</b> <b>planning)</b> of summer 1938 {{and later in the}} interior policy of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia. In March 1938 the Farmers League joined the SdP, as well as many Christian Social deputies in the Czechoslovak parliament. At a convention in Carlsbad on April 24 the majority of the party advocated the demand of the Sudeten Germans as an autonomous ethnic group, the separation of a self-governing German settlement area and the freedom to decide for the Anschluss to Nazi Germany. At this time the SdP had about 1.35 million members.|$|E

50|$|Today, the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 {{contains}} the <b>basic</b> <b>planning</b> rules. Section 57 requires permission be granted for ‘development’ of land. Section 55 defines ‘development’ as building, engineering, mining, or making any material change to building, including demolition, or splitting a home into two. However, subsection 2 exempts changes to dwelling houses for something incidental to enjoyment, for agriculture or forestry, or changes of a property's use within {{a set of}} property ‘classes’. For many people making changes to business property, the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 then becomes relevant. Each property use has a class. Class A1 includes shops like bookstores or hairdressers, class A3 includes cafes, class C1 is hotels, and class C3 is homes. If a change to a property's use is made within a class, no permission for alterations is needed. If permission is granted, it may be unconditional, or under section 106 the local authority can attach conditions that the landowner must follow. Sections 171A to 196C contain the enforcement rules, which include allowing local authorities to charge people with offences for breach of planning rules, {{and to have a}} right of entry to property. However, under section 171B, if someone has breached a planning rule, but no enforcement proceedings are brought within four years, there can be no charge: the landowner becomes immune. Sections 197 to 261 contain detailed rules about matters such as trees, advertisements, highways. For establishments that will be used for specific purposes, such as restaurants, pubs or clubs, the Licensing Act 2003 sets out the procedures by which businesses can acquire a licence from their local authority, and the conditions (including time of trading, alcohol provision, and noise levels) under which the establishment must be maintained.|$|E
