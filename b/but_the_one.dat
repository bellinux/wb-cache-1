He {{did not identify}} a type specimen, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for the species. He also did not explicitly give an etymology for the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Latin verticillatus ("whorled"), {{in reference to the}} whorled leaf arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{published}} a formal description and {{name for the}} species in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu.

He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), in reference to the shape of its infructescences.|$|E
5|$|The Inns of Chancery {{sprung up}} around the Inns of Court, and took their name and {{original}} purpose from the chancery clerks, who used the buildings as hostels and offices where they would draft their writs. As with the Inns of Court the precise dates of founding of the Inns of Chancery are unknown, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> commonly {{said to be the}} oldest is Clifford's Inn, which existed from at least 1344. Thavie's Inn, founded in 1349, is considered to be the next oldest, and several legal historians mistakenly considered it the oldest of them all.|$|E

Sellers wrote that a standard mahogany board weighs around thirteen and half pounds <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> used in Crookes' experiment may have been at fault at only six pounds. Crookes responded to Sellers claiming the board weighed six pounds and {{this was not a}} mistake, he also stated he had the board for about sixteen years and it was originally cut in a lumber yard.|$|E
5|$|After the shipwreck, Grill {{remained}} in Canton as resident supercargo for seven years. As such {{he was the}} company's representative in Canton, contacting Chinese merchants as well as buying goods and cargo for the ships. He was supercargo {{for the arrival of}} three more ships of the SIOC: the Stockholms Slott (outward journey) in 1762, the Stockholms Slott (resident supercargo in Canton) in 1765 and the Cron Prins Gustaf (journey home) 1768. One of his tasks in Canton was {{to make sure that the}} Swedish factory at the Thirteen Factories was in good order and maintained. The Swedes rented factories or houses from the mandarins at other locations as well, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> on 13:e Faktorigatan (the 13th Factory street) operated as their main building. Grills records of the Swedish factory are detailed and provide good insight into life in Canton at that time.|$|E
5|$|Although Niémen {{was very}} badly damaged, Amethyst was almost {{uncontrollable}} and despite Seymour's best efforts, {{he was unable}} to close with Niémen to ensure her surrender. Dupotet meanwhile was overseeing hasty repairs in the hope of getting away before Amethyst could recover. At 03:45, however, a new ship emerged from the darkness, soon revealed to be the British frigate HMS Arethusa. Arethusa was deployed as part of the force blockading the ports of Northern Spain and her commander, Captain Robert Mends, was a successful officer who had been commended just two weeks earlier for raiding the French-held port of Lekeitio. Mends immediately pulled alongside Niémen and Dupotet fired a single shot each at Amethyst and Arethusa. The shot at Amethyst missed its target, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> at Arethusa struck the ship and threw up splinters. Mends was struck on the forehead and badly wounded, the only man to be hit. Both Amethyst and Arethusa then opened fire, Niémen surrendering immediately.|$|E

5|$|When US12 was {{designated}} in Michigan on November 11, 1926, {{along with the}} other original US Highways, it ran along a more northerly course. It originally replaced sections of the original M-11 and M-17 along Michigan Avenue in the state, the route of the much older St. Joseph Trail, a footpath used by Native Americans before European settlement in the area. It entered from Indiana as it does now, but it followed the Lake Michigan shoreline farther north to Benton Harbor–St. Joseph before turning eastward to run through Kalamazoo, Battle Creek and Jackson. In the Ann Arbor area, it followed a more northerly path into Detroit before terminating downtown. In the 1940s and 1950s, sections of the highway were converted into expressways and freeways. Starting in 1959, these freeway segments were renumbered as part of I-94, and in January 1962, US12 was shifted to replace US Highway112 (US112). That highway, when it {{was designated}} in 1926 replaced the original M-23 along the Chicago Road. Later, US112 replaced the first M-151 when the former was extended to New Buffalo in the mid-1930s. Since 1962, the highway has remained relatively unchanged aside from minor truncations in the city of Detroit. US112 previously had two business loops, both of which were renumbered Business US12 (Bus. US12) in 1962. In 2010, the Niles business loop was decommissioned, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> in Ypsilanti remains. One section of the former US112 was renumbered US112S for a few years in the 1930s.|$|E

25|$|Hall {{was a man}} of {{independent}} means and seems to have been careless of fame; at least he took no trouble to communicate his invention to the world. At a trial in Westminster Hall about the patent rights granted to John Dollond (Watkin v. Dollond), Hall was admitted to be the first inventor of the achromatic telescope. However, it was ruled by Lord Mansfield that it was not the original inventor who ought to profit from such invention, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> who brought it forth for the benefit of mankind.|$|E
25|$|In {{the human}} level, with the {{development}} of consciousness, love, although continuous with its lower forms, attains a higher form because of its relation to reason. In the beginning these two factors are in a natural harmony, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> doesn't have conscious access to the other. Each one operates almost separately from the other. Then comes a stage where reason and love come in rapport and conflict with each other, yet the important factor is that they start coming simultaneously in the conscious sphere. Then comes a third stage where a synthesis of love and reason is achieved to bring an altogether new type of consciousness, best described as superconsciousness.|$|E

25|$|Sauron, however, {{had survived}} the {{destruction}} of Númenor and secretly returned to his realm of Mordor just {{to the east of}} Gondor. Soon he launched a war against the Númenórean kingdoms, hoping to destroy them before their power was established. He captured Minas Ithil, but Isildur escaped and fled by ship to Arnor; meanwhile, Anárion was able to defend Osgiliath. Elendil and the Elven-king Gil-galad formed the Last Alliance of Elves and Men, and together with Isildur and Anárion, they besieged and defeated Mordor. Sauron was overthrown, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Ring that Isildur took from him was not destroyed, and thus Sauron was able to regain power in the next age.|$|E
25|$|Ehrlichia is a rickettsial {{bacteria}} {{belonging to}} the family Ehrlichiaceae. There are several species of Ehrlichia, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>one</b> that most commonly affects dogs and causes the most severe clinical signs is Ehrlichia canis. This species infects monocytes in the peripheral blood. The brown dog tick, or Rhipicephalus sanguineous, that passes the organism to the dog is prevalent {{throughout most of the}} United States, but most cases tend to occur in the Southwest and Gulf Coast regions where there is a high concentration of the tick. Ehrlichia is found {{in many parts of the}} world and was first recognized in Algeria in 1935. During the Vietnam War ehrlichiosis became well known as a dog disease due to the infection and death of many military working dogs. Two types of human ehrlichiosis have been identified in the United States: human monocytic ehrlichiosis and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis.|$|E
25|$|Sly {{signed with}} Warner Bros. and {{recorded}} Back on the Right Track (1979). Although the album featured contributions from Freddie and Rose Stone, Sly remained unable {{to return to}} the success of his late '60s and early '70s fame. He toured with George Clinton and Funkadelic during the late 1970s and early 1980s, and also appeared on the 1981 Funkadelic album The Electric Spanking of War Babies. That year, Clinton and Sly began work on a new Sly Stone album; however, recording halted when Clinton and Funkadelic disputed with and left Warner Bros. Records in late 1981. When Sly disappeared into seclusion, producer Stewart Levine completed the album, which was released as Ain't <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>One</b> Way in 1982. The album sold poorly and received mixed critical reception, but Sly made an appearance on Late Night With David Letterman that year. Overcome by drug addictions, Sly Stone disappeared from the limelight and entered drug rehabilitation in 1984, at the insistence of his old friend Bobby Womack. Sly continued sporadically releasing new singles and collaborations until a 1987 arrest and conviction for cocaine possession and use. Afterwards, he stopped releasing music.|$|E
