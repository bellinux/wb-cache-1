40|$|Abstract: Most of the {{induction}} motors {{are of the}} rotary type with basically a stationary stator and rotating rotor. In this study, an inverted rotor induction motor is designed and produced. This motor has mechanical revolving characteristics both rotor and stator. In this type of construction the rotor has three-phase winding as well, similar to the stator wound for {{the same number of}} poles as the stator winding. The wound-rotor winding terminates in slip rings mounted on the rotor shaft. Brushes ride on the slip rings. Also measurement coils are placed upper of the same slots of the stator and rotor windings of the inverted rotor induction motor. Regardless of the rotor construction employed, rotor currents in this motor are induced by the stator’s changing, or rather, rotating, and magnetic fields. This induction action is the central operating principle of ac induction motors. Waveforms of the induced voltages on the rotor and stator windings are investigated. Rotating magnetic fields of the rotor and stator are measured <b>by</b> <b>using</b> these <b>measurement</b> coils. Experimental data have been evaluated at rotation fields of the rotor and stator <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>measurement</b> coils...|$|R
