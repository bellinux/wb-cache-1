25|$|Three oracles had {{successively}} {{operated in}} Delphi – the chthonion using egkoimisi (procedure that involved {{sleeping in the}} Holy place, so as to see a revealing dream), the Kliromanteion and finally the Apollonian, with the laurel. <b>But</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> {{the introduction of the}} cult of Dionysus at Delphi, the god that brought his followers into ecstasy and madness, the Delphic god gave oracles through Pythia, who also fell into a trance under the influence of vapors and fumes coming from the opening, the inner sanctum of the Oracle. Pythia sat on top of a tall gilded tripod that stood above the opening. In the old days, Pythia was a virgin, young girl, <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> Echecrates from Thessaly fell in love, kidnapped and violated a young and beautiful Pythia, a woman older than fifty years old was chosen, who dressed and wore jewelry to resemble a young maiden girl. According to tradition, Phemonoe was the first Pythia.|$|E

500|$|Handlen {{felt that}} the {{character}} development of Carl Grimes was more stable than similar developments in the episode; [...] "Using Carl to both resolve the episode’s plot, and making him semi-responsible for Dale’s death, has a satisfying neatness, {{and serves as a}} reminder that for all their talk, Rick and the group have no idea what impact their choices will make." [...] Likewise, Jackson and Ryan Rigley of MTV noticed the darker transition of the character; [...] "Carl's moral compass has greatly shifted since being shot and seeing the walking corpse of his friend, Sophia," [...] asserted Rigley. Jackson concluded {{that it was one of}} the episode highlights, writing, [...] "He awakened from his coma talking about the beautiful doe, <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> the dead body of Sophia limped its way out of that barn door, he's become colder and harder. When Carol sees him at Sophia’s gravesite, she tries to comfort him with talk of heaven, and he calls her an idiot. He's looking to emulate the men leading the group—the different kinds of toughness displayed by his father, Shane and Daryl. And he finds the chance to test his own bravery, playing near a zombie stuck in the mud by the creek, keeping the discovery to himself." [...] Jackson commented on Carl's reaction to the death of Dale, saying that despite a gradual change to a dark nature, he [...] "realizes [...] that he's still very much a kid".|$|E

2500|$|Halleck, more a bureaucrat than a soldier, {{was able}} to impose little {{discipline}} or direction on his field commanders. Strong personalities such as George B. McClellan, John Pope, and Ambrose Burnside routinely ignored his advice and instructions. A telling example of his lack of control was during the Northern Virginia Campaign of 1862, when Halleck was unable to motivate McClellan to reinforce Pope in a timely manner, contributing to the Union defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run. It was from this incident that Halleck fell from grace. Abraham Lincoln {{said that he had}} given Halleck full power and responsibility as general in chief. [...] "He ran it on that basis till Pope's defeat; <b>but</b> <b>ever</b> <b>since</b> that event he has shrunk from responsibility whenever it was possible."In Halleck's defense, his subordinate commanders in the Eastern Theater, whom he did not select, were reluctant to move against General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. Many of his generals in the West, other than Grant, also lacked aggressiveness. And despite Lincoln's pledge to give the general in chief full control, both he and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton micromanaged many aspects of the military strategy of the nation. Halleck wrote to Sherman, [...] "I am simply a military advisor of the Secretary of War and the President, and must obey and carry out what they decide upon, whether I concur in their decisions or not. As a good soldier I obey the orders of my superiors. If I disagree with them I say so, but when they decide, is my duty faithfully to carry out their decision." ...|$|E
