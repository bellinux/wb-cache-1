500|$|Ironically, {{the least}} self-confident {{performer}} {{in the film}} {{was one of the}} few professional actors: Vladimir Pucholt, who played the pianist. According to Forman: [...] "This great actor, who had tremendous artistic intuition, completely mistrusted his talent. I think this was because he had a very rationalist disposition and could never see, much less measure, the result of his acting. 'Was it good, Mr. Forman?” he asked me after every perfect shot. 'It was excellent!' 'Really?' 'Really.' He never <b>believed</b> <b>me</b> and all of us loved him.|$|E
500|$|Lead actress Kristen Bell, who deduced that Aaron Echolls was {{the killer}} in Season 1, {{was unable to}} figure out the {{identity}} of the murderer in Season 2. [...] "You never, ever see the show keep the killer in the main titles," [...] adding that the writers [...] "think they're so smart…and they are!" [...] Actor Michael Muhney, who plays Don Lamb, expressed some anxiety {{over the course of the}} season that he would be the killer. However, Bell played a prank on Muhney, telling him that she knew the killer was going to be Loretta Cancun, a minor character from the pilot. Bell said, [...] " [...] only <b>believed</b> <b>me</b> for like a day." [...] Kyle Gallner, who plays Beaver, did not know that his character was going to be the murderer until just before the shooting of [...] "Not Pictured", when one of the costume designers told him about the reveal: ...|$|E

Along with Sassoon as Minister of Finance, Jafar Pasha al-Askari as Minister of Defence and six other ministers including Sayid Talib as Minister of the Interior. The {{next step was to}} choose a King to unite the tribally fractured country. Sassoon had already offered his opinions on the matter as was recounted again by Miss Bell: “I had a long and interesting talk with Sasun Eff. the other day—I went to call on his sister in law and found all the men there eager to embark on talk. Sasun Eff. said he felt sure that no local man would be acceptable as head of the state because every other local man would be jealous of him. He went on to throw out feelers in different directions—one might think of a son of the Sharif, or {{a member of the family}} of the Sultan of Egypt, if there was a suitable individual, or of the family of the Sultan of Turkey? I said I for my part felt sure that Sir Percy didn't and couldn't mind whom they selected except that I thought the Turkish family was ruled out—it ought to be an Arab prince. Sasun Eff. said [...] "If they think you are backing S. Talib they will all agree outwardly to S. Talib, whatever they think of him. I remember when once I happened to be on the same boat with him coming back from Constantinople —it was when S. Talib was a deputy. Almost without exception the people of Basrah hated and feared him, and if you'll believe me they all came down to Muhammarah to welcome him! and the ones that hated him most gave him the most cordial reception. They were afraid of him. So it would be now." [...] I again insisted that we could find no interest or advantage in backing anyone; it was entirely a matter for the people themselves to decide, but whether he <b>believed</b> <b>me</b> or not I can't say. He had, however, hit on the root of the matter. Anyone they think we're backing they will agree to—and then intrigue against him without intermission. It's not an easy furrow to plough!” ...|$|E
