A waltz accompanies the gallery scene until the picture is shown, leading to Some Day When Dreams Come True as the artist becomes famous. The {{introduction}} with the society woman is accompanied by How Do You Do Miss Josephine and then by So Long Mary as she exits. No Place Like Home begins the next scene until the wife recognizes the emotional distancing of her husband when All I Ask is Love is played. The studio scene begins with I Love My Wife, <b>But</b> <b>Oh</b> You Kid and leads to Be Sweet to Me Kid or Next to your Mother... with Nobody's Little Girl during the crying scene.|$|E

500|$|A {{music video}} for [...] "Voodoo" [...] was not created, <b>but</b> <b>Oh</b> Land has {{performed}} the song on several occasions, including at the Heaven nightclub in London in February 2012. During the event she sang every song from Oh Land {{with the exception}} of [...] "Helicopter". The performance was compared to similar ones by Rihanna, but Tyler Kieron from The Arts Desk insisted that it was more along the lines of Robyn.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot on a stretch of beach {{on the coast of}} California in Malibu and {{directed}} by Marcus Raboy. In an interview with MTV News, Rihanna spoke about the development of the shoot for the video, saying [...] "The water was so cold... <b>but</b> <b>oh</b> my gosh, we had so much fun... We were bumping each other off the Jet Skis and just had a ball". During the interview, the singer elaborated further upon the content of the video and the meaning behind it, saying [...] "This video is about having fun, giving off the vibe of the Caribbean... we did some mermaid-looking stuff down on the sand...and I'm just [...] to the camera as if it were my boyfriend. Now we're going to do [...] the Tiki torches. It's going to be incredible". [...] The dance routines in the video were choreographed by noted choreographer Fatima Robinson.|$|E

When they land the car, Tip immediately starts looking for her mother, <b>but</b> <b>Oh</b> insists on evacuating with the other Boov instead. Tip gets angry at him for trying to break their promise again, and she declares that they were {{never meant to be}} friends. Heartbroken, Oh returns to the ship. The Gorg mothership comes close to the Boov ship, <b>but</b> <b>Oh</b> pulls out the Gorg chip and uses it to fly the ship further away from the Gorg. The Boov become astonished at Oh's plan, but Smek becomes upset and reminds everyone that he is the captain. However, after Oh tells the Boov about what he learned from Tip, the Boovs then mutiny against Smek and Kyle grabs Smek's [...] "Shusher" [...] (a scepter with a rock on top of it, which Smek stole from the Gorg) and gives it to Oh, declaring him the new captain, much to Smek's annoyance.|$|E

[...] I know that it would mean a great deal of trouble for the poet but my first task would be to try and {{compensate}} him..... all he would have to do would be to condense and tighten up; the action is already there ready made, and it's all immensely good theatre. Tomorrow I'll write at length to Piave setting out all the scenes from Hernani which seem to me suitable.|$|E
2500|$|The other façade {{is marked}} by the style of Louis XII, and {{is a mixture of}} the end of the Gothic and the {{beginning}} of the Renaissance. [...] The stone pediments of the attic windows and bases of windows with linenfold panels remain still completely Gothic. The most beautiful example of this mixture is on the door of the tower, the old principal door of the château moved from the façade of François I by Louis de la Saussaye because of its small size. One finds linenfold there too, a Gothic motif par excellence, but also, on the door stop, a salamander, an emblem of François I. Above, Louis de la Saussaye had engraved, in Greek, this sentence ascribed to the general Themistocles: [...] "Small is the house, <b>but</b> <b>oh</b> how much happiness, if it is filled with friends." ...|$|E

2500|$|The opening stanzas {{evoke the}} poet {{gazing into the}} fire imagining a primeval forest older than myth, [...] "before the fauns". But his {{traumatic}} experiences on the Western Front intrude on his somewhat romantic meditation: [...] "Wrote a poem on the Colliery Disaster: but I get mixed up with the War at the end. It is short, <b>but</b> <b>oh!</b> sour." [...] The gently hissing coals recall the moans of the dying miners [...] "writhing for air"; and Owen intertwines their death with that of soldiers at the front, imagining heaps of white bones in the fire's ashes and [...] "muscled bodies charred". Yet in the future, the centuries will still doze by the fire, its coals themselves formed out of [...] "rich loads", of groans and toil in the dark pits of war. The coming years, preserved in their rooms like insects in amber will be oblivious {{of the millions of}} dead lads - soldiers and miners - buried under the earth.|$|E
2500|$|Tip rushes aimlessly {{around the}} city to find Lucy, but in vain. Just when all hope seems lost, Oh returns to her side and helps her track down Lucy. The mother and {{daughter}} finally reunite and thank Oh. Suddenly, the Gorg mothership descends upon the planet, and Oh realizes that they want the rock on the Shusher, since Smek had previously stolen it from them. Oh runs to the ship to try to attract its attention, locking Tip and Lucy {{in the car for}} safety. Tip breaks {{out of the car and}} shines a light in the Gorg Commander (Brian Stepanek)'s face to bring his attention to Oh as he holds the rock up. The Gorg Commander [...] halts the ship as it crunches down on the ground, with Oh directly in its path. Tip rushes to rescue him, <b>but</b> <b>Oh</b> is seemingly crushed beneath the ship. It backs up and Oh is okay. The Gorg Commander emerges from his armor to show that he is actually a harmless starfish-like creature. Oh returns the rock to him, which turns out to be an egg for millions of developing Gorg larvae; the next generation of Gorg, revealing that the Gorg Commander/"Father" [...] had been the last of his kind, alone and almost extinct. He thanks Oh and departs.|$|E
2500|$|Many feminists {{of the era}} {{were opposed}} to abortion. In The Revolution, {{operated}} by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, an anonymous contributor signing [...] "A" [...] wrote in 1869 about the subject, arguing that instead of merely attempting {{to pass a law}} against abortion, the root cause must also be addressed. Simply passing an anti-abortion law would, the writer stated, [...] "be only mowing {{off the top of the}} noxious weed, while the root remains. [...] No matter what the motive, love of ease, or a desire to save from suffering the unborn innocent, the woman is awfully guilty who commits the deed. It will burden her conscience in life, it will burden her soul in death; <b>But</b> <b>oh!</b> thrice guilty is he who drove her to the desperation which impelled her to the crime." [...] To many feminists of this era, abortion was regarded as an undesirable necessity forced upon women by thoughtless men. Even the [...] "free love" [...] wing of the feminist movement refused to advocate abortion and treated the practice as an example of the hideous extremes to which modern marriage was driving women. Marital rape and the seduction of unmarried women were societal ills which feminists believed caused the need to abort, as men did not respect women's right to abstinence.|$|E

2500|$|By New Year 1924, Bow {{defied the}} possessive Maxine Alton {{and brought her}} father to Hollywood. Bow remembered their reunion: [...] "I didn't care a rap, for (Maxine Alton), or B. P. Schulberg, or my motion picture career, or Clara Bow, I just threw myself {{into his arms and}} kissed and kissed him, and we both cried like a couple of fool kids. Oh, it was wonderful." [...] Bow felt Alton had misused her trust: [...] "She wanted to keep a hold on me so she made me think I wasn't getting over and that nothing but her clever {{management}} kept me going." [...] Bow and her father moved in at 1714 North Kingsley Drive in Hollywood, together with Jacobson, who by then also worked for Preferred. When Schulberg learned of this arrangement, he fired Jacobson for potentially getting [...] "his big star" [...] into a scandal. When Bow found out, [...] "She tore up her contract and threw it in his face and told him he couldn't run her private life." [...] Jacobson concluded, [...] " [...] was the sweetest girl in the world, but you didn't cross her and you didn't do her wrong." [...] On September 7, 1924, The Los Angeles Times, in a significant article [...] "A dangerous little devil is Clara, impish, appealing, <b>but</b> <b>oh,</b> how she can act!", her father is titled [...] "business manager" [...] and Jacobson referred to as her brother.|$|E
2500|$|Lyle Masaki of AfterElton.com commends the manga for {{illustrating}} [...] "the challenges gay men face in Japanese society", and for {{not following}} the traditional mode of student-teacher romantic relationships in [...] "Boys Love" [...] titles, opting instead for a friendship where both characters discover {{more about what}} it is to be a gay man. Holly Ellingwood at Active Anime commended the first volume its unique artwork, and praised the plot for its [...] "bittersweet" [...] poignancy, and for showing unrequited love rather than being a simplistic story about [...] "winning the guy". She felt the second volume had [...] "unusual pacing" [...] and came off as [...] "abrupt" [...] peeks into the lives of many different couples. Mania.com's Danielle Van Gorder praised the manga for its characterization and ability to reflect reality. Erin Finnegan of Pop Culture Shock criticized the story for Ida and Hachizume adopting each other, essentially getting married, before having sex, which she regarded as unrealistic. Comic World News's David Welsh says that Yoshinaga's characters, even in this early work, have layers, and that it is enjoyable to see how the frank student inspires the adult characters to communicate better. Coolstreak Cartoons's Leroy Douresseaux criticizes the manga for its inability to focus on one couple. Robin Brenner described the plot as being [...] "an engaging meditation on how crushes are wonderful, <b>but</b> <b>oh,</b> how they can hurt." [...] Jason Thompson regarded the story as having been [...] "padded out", but enjoyed the theme of [...] "love and loss" [...] in the manga. [...] Johanna Draper Carlson felt it was novel for the treatment of sex in the first volume to consist of a character making sure they would be able to satisfy their partner. [...] She felt the second volume was strange for being largely sex scenes.|$|E
2500|$|Adam is {{an expert}} swordsman; he carries a {{swordstick}} and will cold-bloodedly kill any enemy who deserves it. He {{is not the only}} British hero with such a weapon; John Steed of The Avengers had a sword umbrella, and Lord Peter Wimsey had a specially made sword cane with a compass, which was also marked in inches so it could serve as a measuring tool. [...] He was a Colonel and has been on the volunteer strength of the 51st Yeomanry since 1895 – though he is naturally listed on their official records as being [...] "missing, presumed killed" [...] since 1902. He is also a good boxer and occasionally demonstrates proficiency in jujitsu, which had been introduced to England several years before he was frozen. Adam immediately became embroiled in the criminal world of the 1960s when Georgina was threatened after almost being witness to the murder of her grandfather by protection racketeers at a disco. Though there is no indication of where his money comes from or how he supports himself, Adam rebuilt his old home, the long demolished 26A Albany Street, {{on the top of a}} multi-storey car park, which he had bought, at 17 Upper Thames Street in central London. [...] It is accessed by a lift hidden on the other side of a sliding wall, activated from the outside by pressing a cleverly hidden call button. [...] He also purchased a Mini Cooper S with the personalised numberplate AA 1000. The car is dark green and tan (or perhaps dark brown and gold, please see the DVD), it has a sun-roof, electric windows, and a very posh interior. It was a special conversion: a [...] "Mini de Ville" [...] by Harold Radford Coach Builder LTD. He occasionally does a job for the British Government, as in [...] "More Deadly Than the Sword". When he is knocked unconscious, Adam usually dreams of how he was caught by the Face and of Louise telling him: [...] "So clever, <b>but</b> <b>oh</b> so vulnerable." [...] This is apt, as many women take advantage of his Victorian naïveté.|$|E
