40|$|BACKGROUND: Drug-induced toxic {{epidermal}} necrolysis (TEN) probably {{results from}} a complex and specific immune cell reaction involving lymphocytes and macrophages. OBJECTIVE: To assess the functional role of macrophages in TEN. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry was performed on biopsies from early blisters developed in 9 TEN patients. The amount of extracellular myeloperoxidase (MPO) was measured by ELISA in TEN blister fluid and serum. Controls were blister fluids taken from 9 second-degree burns. In addition, 3 -chlorotyrosine (a specific marker of MPO activity) was searched for using liquid mass chromatography both in TEN and <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluids. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry revealed numerous CD 68 + macrophages in 8 / 9 TEN patients; 5 - 20 % of these cells and rare CD 15 + neutrophils exhibited MPO immunoreactivity, while keratinocytes were negative. The amount of MPO was significantly higher in TEN blister fluid than in TEN serum, suggesting macrophage production of MPO in the skin. In addition, MPO was significantly more abundant in TEN blister fluid than in <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluid. 3 -Chlorotyrosine was detected in 7 / 9 TEN blister fluids, but in only 2 / 9 <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluids. DISCUSSION: MPO produced by macrophages was functionally active in most TEN patients, leading {{to the production of}} hypochlorous acid, a potent oxidative compound that alters keratinocytes.

40|$|The data {{presented}} here {{are associated with}} the article “The blister fluid proteome of paediatric burns” (Zang et al., 2016) [1]. Burn injury is a highly traumatic event for children. The degree of burn severity (superficial-, deep-, or full-thickness injury) often dictates the extent of later scar formation which may require long term surgical operation or skin grafting. The data were obtained by fractionating paediatric <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluid samples, which were pooled according to burn depth and then analysed using data dependent acquisition LC–MS/MS. The data includes a table of all proteins identified, in which burn depth category they were found, the percentage sequence coverage for each protein and the number of high confidence peptide identifications for each protein. Further Gene Ontology enrichment analysis shows the significantly over-represented biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components of the <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluid proteome. In addition, tables include the proteins associated with the biological processes of “wound healing” and “response to stress” as examples of highly relevant processes that occur in burn wounds...|$|E

40|$|Highlights - Paediatric <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluid {{proteome}} - Over 800 proteins {{were identified}} including unique proteins in superficial, deep, and full thickness burns - GO analysis reveal the underlying biological processes respond to burn injury - Increased knowledge of <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluid biochemistry provides valuable insight for clinical practice of paediatric burns Abstract Burn injury is highly traumatic for paediatric patients, with {{the severity of}} the burn often dictating the extent of scar formation. The diagnosis of burn wound severity is largely determined by the attending clinician's experience. Thus, a greater understanding of the biochemistry at burn wound site environment and the biology of burns of different severities at an earlier stage may reduce the reliance on subjective diagnoses. In this study, blister fluid was collected from superficial thickness, deep-partial thickness, and full-thickness paediatric burn wounds. Samples were combined together based on burn depth classification and then subjected to four different fractionation methods followed by trypsin digestion. Peptides were analysed by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry in order to measure the proteomeof each fraction. In total, 811 individual proteinswere identified, including 107, 84, and 146 proteins unique to superficial, deep-partial thickness and full-thickness burn wounds, respectively. The differences in the protein inventory and the associated gene ontologies represented within each burn depth category demonstrated that there are subtle, yet significant, variations in the biochemistry of burn wounds according to severity. Importantly, this study has produced the most comprehensive catalogue of proteins from the paediatric burn wound microenvironment to date. Significance: To our knowledge, this study has been the first to comprehensivelymeasure the paediatric <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluid proteome and has provided insight into the proteomic response to burn injury. The study contributes to the knowledge of blister fluid biochemistry of burn injury and provides clinically relevant knowledge through the qualitative evaluation of biochemical differences between burns of different depths. A better understanding of the burn wound environment will ultimately assist with more accurate clinical decision making and improved wound healing and scar reduction procedures...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) - 8 and - 9 are {{released}} from neutrophils in acute inflammation and {{may contribute to}} permeability changes in burn injury.

40|$|Burn {{wound healing}} {{is a complex}} and dynamic process that {{involves}} the interaction between different cell types and mediators. Neovascularization is an imperative stage of wound healing and consists of not only angiogenesis but also adult vasculogenesis. A superficial partial-thickness burn (SPTB) heals within 2 weeks without scarring. A deep partial-thickness burn (DPTB), conversely, requires 2 weeks or longer to heal and requires an aggressive treatment to prevent hypertrophic scarring. Burn blisters on the skin are a hallmark of not only SPTB but also DPTB; however, the effect of <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluids on the neovascularization in these types of burns has not been fully explored. To verify this effect, the role of different burn fluids and the angiogenic factors that modulate this process are currently under investigation...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Human β-defensin (HBD) and the {{complement}} system are two important innate immune mechanisms active against {{a broad range}} of burn and wound pathogens. However, excessive or uncontrolled complement activation, following thermal injury, contributes to tissue damage. Previous studies from our laboratory suggested a decreased expression of HBD- 2 in burn wounds and its absence in <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluid. Prior studies have demonstrated that human neutrophil peptide can bind to the C 1 q component of the {{complement system}} and prevent complement activation. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine whether HBD- 1 and HBD- 2 can also bind to the C 1 q component and modulate complement activity. Methods: The binding efficiency of HBD- 1 and HBD- 2 to the C 1 q component was determined by utilizing dot blot hybridization. The effect of HBD- 2 on the activation of the complement system by the classical and alternative pathways was determined by CH 50 and AP 50 assays. In addition, the ability of HBD- 1 and HBD- 2 to inhibit C 1 q activity was predicted by a comparison with known C 1 q inhibitor peptide 2 J in a DNAStar computer modeling study. Results: C 1 q binding to HBD- 2 was strong, whereas C 1 q binding to HBD- 1 was weak. HBD- 2 inhibits th...|$|E
40|$|Burn {{wound healing}} {{is a complex}} process {{consisting}} of an inflammatory phase, the formation of granulation tissue, and remodeling. The role of the CXCL 12 /CXCR 4 pathway in the recovery of skin following burns is unknown. We found that CXCL 12 is similarly expressed in human, swine, and rat skin by pericyte and endothelial cells, fibrous sheet, fibroblasts, and axons. Following burns, the levels of CXCL 12 were markedly increased in human <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluids. One day after injury, there was a gradual increase in the expression of CXCL 12 in the hair follicles and in blood vessel endothelium surrounding the burn. Three to 11 days following burns, an increased number of fibroblasts expressing CXCL 12 were observed in the recovering dermis of rat, swine, and human skin. In contrast to CXCL 12, CXCR 4 expression was detected in proliferating epithelial cells {{as well as in}} eosinophils and mononuclear cells infiltrating the skin. In vitro, CXCL 12 was expressed by primary human skin fibroblasts, but not by keratinocytes, and was stimulated by wounding a confluent cell layer of these fibroblasts. Blocking the CXCR 4 /CXCL 12 axis resulted in the significant reduction in eosinophil accumulation in the dermis and improved epithelialization. Thus, blocking CXCR 4 /CXCL 12 interaction may significantly improve skin recovery after burns...|$|E

40|$|An {{excessive}} {{amount of}} matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9) {{has been well}} documented in inflammatory diseases, including chronic wounds and cancers. Secreted as a zymogen, proMMP- 9 can be irreversibly converted to a mature form through cleavage of the N-terminal propeptide domain. Although the converting enzyme for proMMP- 9 in human tissues is unknown, we previously found that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) promotes activation of proMMP- 9 in human skin, and characterized the converting activities as tissue-associated chymotrypsin-like proteinases. On the other hand, the pathophysiologic inhibitor to prevent proMMP- 9 maturation also remains elusive. In this regard, we observed the presence of the inhibitory property in <b>burn</b> <b>blister</b> fluid that abrogates the skin extract–mediated activation of proMMP- 9. Then we determined that α- 1 -antichymotrypsin (α-ACT), an acute-phase factor abundantly present in the blister, effectively inhibited proMMP- 9 activation in human and rodent skin. In contrast, the aminophenylmercuric acetate-induced “cysteine switch” and activation of proMMP- 9 were not affected by α-ACT. TNF-α-induced activation of proMMP- 9 by the explants of human skin was inhibited by α-ACT but not by related α- 1 -antitrypsin. α-ACT specifically attenuated maturation of proMMP- 9 but not proMMP- 2 or proMMP- 13. Furthermore, short peptides that mimic the reactive center loop (RCL) of α-ACT were sufficient to inhibit the conversion. Mutation analysis demonstrated that a conserved leucine within the RCL was critical for α-ACT-exerted inhibition. In chronic wounds, a large amount of mature MMP- 9 was associated with fragmentation and inactivation of α-ACT. Taken together, these results demonstrate that, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, α-ACT is a previously unreported pathophysiologic inhibitor that controls proMMP- 9 activation in skin tissue...|$|E
