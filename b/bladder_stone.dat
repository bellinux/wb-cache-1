5|$|Shepard died {{unexpectedly}} {{during the}} afternoon of March 24, 1893 at his Manhattan residence. Two doctors were attempting to remove a <b>bladder</b> <b>stone</b> from him. They instructed him to eat lightly, only well before the operation. They gave him the anesthetic ether at 12:45p.m. For a few minutes Shepard {{did not seem to}} react, though soon afterward his color started changing and his respiration and pulse dimmed, so administration of ether was stopped, however not enough ether was given to continue with the operation. His condition started to worsen again; the doctors suspected food or vomit was blocking his windpipe or bronchial tubes. The doctors then administered oxygen, which helped temporarily; however, at 4:00p.m. his pulse became steadily more feeble, he fell unconscious, and died at 4:10p.m. His cause of death was edema and congestion of the lungs, after the administration of ether, but due to an unknown cause.|$|E
25|$|Because of his {{expertise}} in anaesthesia, Clover was often sought out when important figures required surgery. He gave chloroform to Napoleon III of France on 2 January 1873, at Chislehurst, Kent, {{and again on}} 6 January, for a procedure {{to break up a}} <b>bladder</b> <b>stone.</b> The Emperor died on 9 January. Clover was a signatory to his autopsy report, together with five other physicians.|$|E
25|$|In 1823, {{he started}} the now {{well-known}} medical weekly, The Lancet, with William Cobbett, William Lawrence, James Wardrop and a libel lawyer as associates. It was extremely successful: by 1830, it had a circulation of about 4,000. In 1828, one of his accounts of medical negligence accused Bransby Cooper (the nephew of Sir Astley Cooper, the General Surgeon) of incompetence in causing a patient immense suffering as he attempted to extract a <b>bladder</b> <b>stone</b> through a cut beneath the scrotum. Such operations were regularly completed in only a minute's time by excellent surgeons such as the previous century's William Cheselden, but Cooper took {{more than an hour}} and was seen to have great difficulty in locating the stone. The magazine account led to a libel case, Cooper v Wakley, which would raise the profile and popular prestige of Wakley and his magazine. The court found in Cooper's favor, but awarded him much smaller damages than requested, which was generally taken as an acknowledgment that Wakley's accusations of incompetence and nepotism were justified.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bladder</b> <b>stones</b> {{are small}} mineral {{deposits}} that can {{form in the}} bladder. In most cases <b>bladder</b> <b>stones</b> develop when the urine becomes very concentrated or when one is dehydrated. This allows for minerals, such as calcium or magnesium salts, to crystallize and form <b>stones.</b> <b>Bladder</b> <b>stones</b> vary in number, size and consistency. In some cases <b>bladder</b> <b>stones</b> do not cause any symptoms and are discovered as an incidental finding on a plain radiograph. However, when symptoms do occur, these may include severe lower abdominal and back pain, difficult urination, frequent urination at night, fever, painful urination and blood in the urine. The majority of individuals who are symptomatic will complain of pain which comes in waves. The pain may also be associated with nausea, vomiting and chills.|$|R

2500|$|After Prussia emerged victorious {{over the}} Austrian army at the Battle of Königgrätz (also known as Sadowa or Sadová) in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, {{negotiations}} {{were being held}} between Austria and Prussia in July and August of that year. It was during that period that Napoleon III first discovered that a <b>bladder</b> <b>stone</b> was causing him great pains, created from gonorrheal infection. His condition was so bad during those negotiations that {{he was forced to}} retire to Vichy to recuperate, removing himself from Paris. Although the emperor favored neutrality as to not upset events, certain members of his circle thought it was an unwise move, considering the opportunity to prevent Prussia from becoming too strong. One of these men, foreign minister Édouard Drouyn de Lhuys, convinced the emperor to plant 80,000 men on the eastern border to convince Wilhelm I to maintain {{the balance of power in}} Europe. Despite this important victory, de Lhuys was subverted by several other ministers, and Napoleon III changed his mind, reverting to a position of neutrality. This change of heart would end up causing de Lhuys to ultimately lose his position. Napoleon III's wife Empress Eugénie, who took an active part throughout his rule, referred to this time much later as [...] "the critical date, the Empire's fatal date; it was during these months of July and August that our fate was sealed! Of all that period, there is not a single fact, not a single detail that has not remained in my mind." ...|$|E

One can have one or {{multiple}} <b>stones.</b> <b>Bladder</b> <b>stones</b> are somewhat more common in men who have prostate enlargement.

When nerves to the back are damaged, the bladder cannot empty, resulting in stagnant urine.|$|R

40|$|Background: Diabetes {{mellitus}} and gall <b>bladder</b> <b>stones</b> {{are both}} common and costly diseases. Increasing age, female gender, overweight, familial {{history of the}} disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus is all associated with an increased risk of gallstones. Several studies from around the world reported an increased prevalence of gall <b>bladder</b> <b>stones</b> in patients with diabetes mellitus. Aims and objectives: The aim {{of this study was to}} define the frequency of gall <b>bladder</b> <b>stones</b> among Libyan diabetics and to evaluate the possible associated risk factors in these patients. Patients and methods: A casecontrol study was performed during 2007 at Benghazi Diabetes and endocrinology Center. The study involved 161 randomly selected type- 2 diabetic patients under regular follow up at the center, and 166 age and sex matched non-diabetic outpatients at the 7 th of October teaching hospital. Real-time abdominal ultrasound was performed by two radiologists to examine the abdomen after an overnight fast. Results: About 40 % of the diabetic cohort had gall <b>bladder</b> <b>stones</b> as compared to 17. 5 % of non-diabetic patients. Females were significantly more affected than males. Patients with gall <b>bladder</b> <b>stones</b> were significantly older and had a significantly higher body mass index than those without stones. Conclusion: The prevalence of gallstones in Libyan diabetic patients is higher than the rates reported in other parts of the world. Libyan diabetic patients with gallstones tend to be older and more obese than those without gallstones. Duration of diabetes mellitus and type of treatment does not seem to influence the frequency of gall <b>bladder</b> <b>stones</b> among Libyan diabetics...|$|R
