50|$|On 20 September 2011, {{during the}} Transexpo Trade Fair in 2011, the company {{presented}} the first {{prototype of the}} Solaris Urbino electric LE 8.9. The new model is equipped with an electric drive engine power system, whose main component is produced by the German company Vossloh Kiepe, a four pole asynchronous motor with a maximum power of 120 kW (163 HP) and maximum torque of 1400 Nm. The energy to power the motor is stored in two liquid-cooled lithium batteries with a total capacity of 120.9 kWh and a rated voltage of 600V, which is made by Wamtechnik in Poland. The maximum charging time for two batteries with a total weight of 1400 kg at a 63A 3x400V loading terminal is 4 hours and can be accessed via a plug-in connector by Walter company. Regenerative braking is used to extend battery life by recovering energy from momentum back into the battery when slowing The maximum range of 100 km, and the bus is able to reach a top speed which is limited to 50 km/h. The <b>brake</b> <b>coil</b> reduces the rate of acceleration of the bus. Electric batteries {{have been used to}} replace compressors driven by an internal combustion engine, so in addition to the drive system there is an energy source for all other systems on the bus, including power steering, heating, ventilation and the electrically control doors. Electrical system is based on CAN bus.|$|E
25|$|The Roadmaster was {{introduced}} {{in a year when}} Buick's valve-in-head straight-eight engines were heavily revised. Buick reduced the number of engines from four sizes to two: a 233-cubic-inch, 93-horsepower job for the Special, and a big, 320.2-cubic inch, 120-horsepower engine for the other series. (To put the size and power of Buickâ€™s larger straight-eight engine in context, compare it to the new 322-cubic-inch mono-block 120 horsepower V-8 that Cadillac introduced that year.) In addition to this major engineering change 1936 was also the year Buick adopted an all steel turret top and hydraulic <b>brakes.</b> <b>Coil</b> springs were in the front.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{production}} SSZ Stradale featured an all new {{tubular chassis}} {{combined with a}} Kevlar reinforced fiberglass body. These cars were powered by an Alfa Romeo 3.0 V6 engine with a 5-speed overdrive transmission coupled to an adjustable ratio live axle. Four wheel 12" [...] driver adjustable <b>brakes,</b> adjustable <b>coil</b> over suspension, rack and pinion steering, front and rear adjustable sway bars, fuel cell and fire system were standard features.|$|R
5000|$|The FB was {{promoted}} as being longer, lower, more spacious {{and more powerful}} than the FC model although in reality it was only slightly so on each count. Overall length was 5.5 in greater whilst the wheelbase remained the same. The engine remained the same at 3" [...] the last model to have this bore, engine capacity remained at 132 cubic inches and the compression ratio was raised. However the resulting extra [...] of power did not compensate for the extra weight of the FB and performance was thus inferior to that of its predecessor. Changes were also made to the <b>brakes,</b> front <b>coil</b> springs, air cleaner and clutch.|$|R
5000|$|The car was {{powered by}} a Morris UB series 918 cc four-cylinder side-valve engine with three-bearing {{crankshaft}} and single SU carburettor with maximum power of [...] The gearbox was a three-speed unit with synchromesh on the top two speeds and Lockheed hydraulic <b>brakes</b> were fitted. <b>Coil</b> ignition was used in a Lucas electrical system {{powered by a}} 6-volt battery and third brush dynamo.|$|R
