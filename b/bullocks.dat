On one occasion in December 1804 Nelson ordered Parker to bring a consignment of live <b>bullocks</b> to supply the fleet off Toulon. The Amazon was a notably smart ship, and had just been repainted, so presumably the instruction to convert his ship into a floating farmyard was not received with much enthusiasm. Parker duly returned with a shipment, prompting Nelson to enquire with gentle humour 'Well, Parker, of course you would not dirty the Amazon for much for anything; have you brought a dozen and a half, or a dozen?' Parker had in fact brought sixty <b>bullocks</b> and thirty sheep, prompting Nelson to promise a reward for his good service.|$|E

25|$|Apart {{from fear}} and fatigue, what disheartened the sepoys {{the most was}} the absence of {{carriage}} cattle.

For the march to Chittagong, no <b>bullocks</b> could be found, since almost all the available animals had already been purchased for the sea-borne expedition to Rangoon.

These requests were disregarded and the sepoys were instead advised to carry whatever they could in their knapsacks and to leave the rest behind. To resolve the situation, commanding officers offered a 4,000 rupee advance to each regiment. The sepoys turned down this offer as it still meant paying baggage charges out of their own pocket. The situation was escalated by threats from a Muslim Indian subedar major, that if they did not stop complaining about the <b>bullocks,</b> they would be sent by sea.|$|E
