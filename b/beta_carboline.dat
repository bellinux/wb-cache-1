40|$|Although the {{function}} of the scorpions fluorescence is unknown, there are two compounds (<b>Beta</b> <b>carboline</b> and 7 -hydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin) responsible for the fluorescence property of scorpions. (Stachel et al. 1999; Frost et al. 2001). The attempt to extract the compounds responsible for the fluorescence was done by cleaning and crushing the fresh frozen cuticle of scorpion (Hadrurus arizonensis). TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography) was used to isolate the fluorescent compound which resulted in three different spots (named ”top”, “middle ” and “bottom “spots). The Rf value of the middle spot was compared to control (7 -hydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin). This reconfirmed the presence of 7 -hydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin in scorpion cuticle. GCMS (Gas cChromatography and Mass spectrometry) was used to identify the presence of the 7 hydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin. The “top spot ” obtained from TLC was analyzed using GCMS. The “top spot ” showed the same mass peak but different retention time compared to 7 -hydroxy- 4 -methylcoumarin, leaving a question if it is an isomer or same compound with an extra group attached to it. Distribution of fluorescent compounds in fresh frozen and ethanol soaked cuticle of scorpion (Hadrurus arizonensis) was studied using epifluorescenc...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of benzodiazepine (BZ) and <b>beta</b> <b>carbolines</b> with GABAA receptor-gated chloride channels using seCi influx blo-chemical functional assay in mammalian spinal cord cultured neurons was investigated. BZ-receptor agonists such as flunitra-zepam, diazepam, clonazepam and flurazepam enhanced {{the effect of}} submaximal concentrations of GABA(1 0 M) -stimulated Cl influx. The rank order of potencies was flunitrazepam> clonazepam> diazepam> flurazepam. In contrast, methyl- 6, 7 -dimethoxy- 4 -ethyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (DMCM), ethyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxylate (beta-CCE), N-methyl-beta-carboline- 3 -carboxamide (FG 71 42) and ethyl- 8 -azido- 5, 6 -dihy-dro- 5 -methyl- 6 -oxo- 4 H-imidazo [1, 5 a][1, 4]-benzodiazepine- 3 -carboxylate (Ro 1 5 - 451 3) inhibited GABA-stimulated Cl influx. The rank order of inhibitory potencies for the inverse agonists was DMCM> beta-CCE> Ro 15 - 4513 > FG 7142. Althoug...|$|R
40|$|Effects of benzodiazepines (BDZs) and <b>beta</b> <b>carbolines</b> (9 CCs) on {{sustained}} repetitive {{firing at}} high frequency (SRF) of action potentials of mouse spinal cord neurons in cell culture were examined using intracellular recording techniques. In control medium neurons responded to depolarizing current pulses with SRF. Limitation of SRF {{was produced by}} the anticonvulsant BDZs (diazepam, clonazepam, nitrazepam and lorazapam) at low to mid nanomolar concentrations, by a convulsant BDZ which does not bind to high affinity BDZ receptors (Ro 5 - 4864) at high nanomolar concentrations and by a BDZ receptor weak partial agonist (Ro 1 5 - 1 788) at micromolar concentrations. The limitation of SRF was accompanied by use- and voltage-depend-ent reduction of maximal rate of nse (Vm) of sodium-dependent action potentials. Partial agonist and inverse agonist flCCs did not limit SRF at concentrations up to 200 nM. The limitation o...|$|R
