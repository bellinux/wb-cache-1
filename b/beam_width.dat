5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} long on keel and narrow of <b>beam</b> (<b>width)</b> {{to allow for}} the {{mounting}} of very heavy guns. The design incorporated a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme to limit hogging (warping) and included extremely heavy planking. This gave the hull greater strength than those of more lightly built frigates. Since the fledgling United States could not match the numbers of ships of the European states, Humphreys designed his frigates to be able to overpower other frigates, but with the speed to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E

5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} {{unusual for the}} time, being long on keel and narrow of <b>beam</b> (<b>width)</b> and {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design called for a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states {{in the size of}} their navies. This being so, the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates with the ability to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E

The basic objective is to have narrow <b>beam</b> <b>widths</b> in heavy handoff areas and wider <b>beam</b> <b>widths</b> in areas with low traffic density. By predefining the <b>beam</b> <b>widths</b> and thus the beams of each sector, optimal sectoring can be achieved using GA at different {{time of the day}} as traffic changes.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, a two-parameter {{discrete}} Gaussian beam summation {{is described}} and then applied to SH seismic waves in a layer over a half space. For {{this case the}} exact solution for the wide-angle reflection and head wave is known by the summation of plane waves or from the modified-Cagniard method. Using Gaussian beam summations over a single angle parameter, the wide-angle reflection and head wave can be generated by using wide <b>beam</b> <b>widths.</b> By using single-parameter beam summations with less wide beams, stable solutions of the wide-angle reflection can be obtained, but not the head wave solution which requires more spectral content. Here we show that both the wide-angle reflection and the head wave can be obtained when using finite <b>beam</b> <b>widths</b> by an over-determined, frame-based Gaussian beam summation over both position and wavenumber. 1.

25|$|The {{introduction}} of the cavity magnetron in 1940 allowed radars to operate effectively at much shorter microwave wavelengths, which reduced the antennas to only a few centimetres long. These antennas were so short {{that they could be}} placed in front of parabolic reflectors, which focused the signal into a very tight beam. Instead of the broadcast pattern being as much as 150 degrees wide, typical microwave designs might have a <b>beam</b> <b>width</b> of perhaps 5 degrees. Using a technique known as conical scanning, a rotating version of lobe switching, this could be further reduced to well under ½ a degree, more than enough to directly lay the guns.|$|E
