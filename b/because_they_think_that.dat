We have formulated three questions whom we want answer to. Method: The essay began with a theoretical research to get more knowledge of intercultural pedagogic. The study part is based on seven interviews in two schools in Södertälje, five with teachers and two with assistant principals. The conclusions of our essay {{are based on the}} results of our study. Result: The study shows that the two discourses “national self-understanding” and “the democratic credot” still lives and compete with each other. School 2 has a more monoculture perspective where the teachers emphasize the Swedish languages as a condition for students to get through their schooling. School 1 is more interested to emphasize the multicultural where the intercultural perspective is something that is clearer. But still none of the two schools have a working mother tongue education, though School 1 concentrates on to give their teacher’s education in these subjects so that they get knowledge and realise the importance for bilingual students to development their mother tongue so that they can development their second language. It can be a consequence that the “national self-understanding” stills exits and that student and their parents therefore decide not to not have a mother tongue education <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that’s</b> the way to get “better” in the Swedish language...|$|R

6000|$|This total {{misunderstanding}} of the real nature of ceremonial {{gives rise to the}} most awkward and dehumanized versions of the conduct of men in rude lands or ages. The man of science, not realizing that ceremonial is essentially a thing which is done without a reason, has to find a reason for every sort of ceremonial, and, as might be supposed, the reason is generally a very absurd one--absurd because it originates not in the simple mind of the barbarian, but in the sophisticated mind of the professor. The teamed man will say, for instance, [...] "The natives of Mumbojumbo Land believe that the dead man can eat and will require food upon his journey to the other world. This is attested {{by the fact that they}} place food in the grave, and that any family not complying with this rite is the object of the anger of the priests and the tribe." [...] To any one acquainted with humanity this way of talking is topsy-turvy. It is like saying, [...] "The English in the twentieth century believed that a dead man could smell. This is attested by the fact that they always covered his grave with lilies, violets, or other flowers. Some priestly and tribal terrors were evidently attached to the neglect of this action, as we have records of several old ladies who were very much disturbed in mind because their wreaths had not arrived in time for the funeral." [...] It may be of course that savages put food with a dead man <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a dead man can eat, or weapons with a dead man <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> a dead man can fight. But personally I do not believe that they think anything of the kind. I believe they put food or weapons on the dead for the same reason that we put flowers, because it is an exceedingly natural and obvious thing to do. We do not understand, it is true, the emotion which makes us think it obvious and natural; but that is because, like all the important emotions of human existence it is essentially irrational. We do not understand the savage for the same reason that the savage does not understand himself. And the savage does not understand himself for the same reason that we do not understand ourselves either.|$|E
