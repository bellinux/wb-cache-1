50|$|Turbines {{equipped}} with a diffuser-shaped shroud and a broad exit ring generate 2-5 times more power than bare wind turbines for any given wind speed or turbine diameter. Further analysis concludes that the <b>Betz's</b> <b>limit</b> can be exceed if the wind turbine were to be {{equipped with}} a diffuser. For multi-rotor turbines {{equipped with a}} diffuser, the power augmentation is smaller, but still favorable at around 5%-9% increase.|$|R
40|$|In {{past several}} years, {{several studies have}} shown that the {{shrouded}} wind turbines can generate greater power compared to bare turbines. The objective of this study is to determine the potential of shrouded wind turbines for increased power generation by conducting numerical simulations. An analytical/computational study is performed by employing the well-known commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software FLUENT. An actuator disc model is used to model the turbine. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations and a two equation realizable k – ε model are employed in the calculations. The power coefficient Cp and generated power are calculated for a large number of cases for horizontal axis wind turbines (HAWT) of various diameters and wind speeds for both bare and shrouded turbines. The design of the shroud is optimized by employing a single objective genetic algorithm; the objective being the maximization of the power coefficient Cp. It was found that the shroud indeed increases the Cp beyond the <b>Betz’s</b> <b>limit</b> significantly and as a result the generated power; this effect is consistent with that found in the recent literature that the shrouded wind-turbines can generate greater power than the bare turbines. The optimized shape of the shroud or diffuser further increases the generated power and Cp...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{shrouded}} wind turbines can generate greater power compared to bare turbines. A solar chimney generates an upward draft of wind inside a tower and a shroud around the wind turbine. There are numerous empty silos on farms in the U. S. that can be converted to solar chimneys with minor modifications at modest cost. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine the potential of these silos/chimneys for generating wind power. The study is conducted through analytical/computational approach by employing the commercial Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. Computations are performed for five different geometric configurations consisting of a turbine, a cylindrical silo, and/or a venturi and/or a diffuser using the dimensions of typical silos and assuming Class 3 wind velocity. The incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with the Boussinesq approximation and a two equation realizable k – ε model are employed in the calculations, and the turbine is modeled as an actuator disk. The power coefficient (Cp) and generated power are calculated for the five cases. Consistent with recent literature, it was found that the silos with diffusers increase the Cp beyond <b>Betz’s</b> <b>limit</b> significantly and thus the generated power. It should be noted that Cp is calculated by normalizing it by the turbine area swept by the wind. This study shows the potential of using abandoned silos in the mid-west and other parts of the country for localized wind power generation...|$|R
50|$|The <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> places {{an upper}} bound on the annual energy that can be {{extracted}} at a site. Even if a hypothetical wind blew consistently for a full year, {{no more than the}} <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> of the energy contained in that year's wind could be extracted. Since wind speed varies, the annual capacity factor of a wind site is around 25% to 60% of the energy that would be generated with constant wind.|$|E

The rotor design is very tedious jobs to achieve <b>Betz’s</b> efficiency <b>limit.</b> Many rotors with good efficiency suffer lesser starting torque or drag problems leading to starting issues. Through the literature hereby revised, it is seen that, to compensate the disadvantage of one with advantage from another rotor, many {{attempts have been made}} to design hybrid rotor of the wind turbines. A simple hybrid turbine offers two rotors on the same shaft of the wind turbine which can be vertical or horizontal. It can harness kinetic energy from wind, river stream, or others fluid streams. In this paper, various approaches of hybrid kinetic turbine rotor have been described and their applications and a typical comparison has also been carried out.

40|$|Aquatic animals {{swimming}} in isolation and in groups {{are known to}} extract energy from the vortices in environmental flows, significantly reducing muscle activity required for locomotion. A model for the vortex dynamics associated with this phenomenon is developed, showing that the energy extraction mechanism can be described by simple criteria governing the kinematics of the vortices relative to {{the body in the}} flow. In this way, we need not make direct appeal to the fluid dynamics, which can be more difficult to evaluate than the kinematics. Examples of these principles as exhibited in swimming fish and existing energy conversion devices are described. A benefit of the developed framework is that the potentially infinite-dimensional parameter space of the fluid–structure interaction is reduced to a maximum of eight combinations of three parameters. The model may potentially aid in the design and evaluation of unsteady aero- and hydrodynamic energy conversion systems that surpass the <b>Betz</b> efficiency <b>limit</b> of steady fluid dynamic energy conversion systems...|$|R

[...] They also praised that despite the viewer's being aware that the entire film takes place within one restricted area, the special effects makeup, the [...] "larger-than-life" [...] sound design, and [...] "deceptively simple" [...] production design, the film maintains a simplicity that [...] "remains completely captivating." [...] They also noted that the film worked as well as it did because of the director's having assembled a fine cast, with special note that the film's lead Ward Roberts was able to convincingly play both ends of the emotional spectrum and take {{what could have been a}} one-dimensional character and bring [...] "him vividly to life."

5000|$|The {{shrouded}} {{tidal turbine}} is an emerging tidal stream technology {{that has a}} turbine enclosed in a venturi shaped shroud or duct (ventuduct), producing a sub atmosphere of low pressure behind the turbine. The venturi shrouded turbine {{is not subject to}} the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> and allows the turbine to operate at higher efficiencies than the turbine alone by increasing the volume of the flow over the turbine. Claimed improvements vary, from 1.15 to 4 times higher power output [...] than the same turbine minus the shroud. The <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> of 59.3% conversion efficiency for a turbine in an open flow still applies, but is applied to the much larger shroud cross-section rather than the small turbine cross-section.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> {{is based}} on an open disk actuator. If a {{diffuser}} is used to collect additional wind flow and direct it through the turbine, more energy can be extracted, but the limit still applies to the cross-section of the entire structure.|$|E
50|$|Some {{manufacturers}} and inventors have made claims of exceeding the limit by using nozzles and other wind diversion devices, usually by misrepresenting the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> and calculating only the rotor area {{and not the}} total input of air contributing to the wind energy extracted from the system.|$|E
5000|$|Tidal energy {{converters}} {{can have}} varying modes of operating and therefore varying power output. If the power coefficient {{of the device}} [...] "" [...] is known, the equation below {{can be used to}} determine the power output of the hydrodynamic subsystem of the machine. This available power cannot exceed that imposed by the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> on the power coefficient, although this can be circumvented to some degree by placing a turbine in a shroud or duct. This works, in essence, by forcing water which would not have flowed through the turbine through the rotor disk. In these situations it is the frontal area of the duct, rather than the turbine, which is used in calculating the power coefficient and therefore the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> still applies to the device as a whole.|$|E
50|$|In 1935 H. Glauert derived the {{expression}} for turbine efficiency, when the angular component of velocity is taken into account, by applying an energy balance across the rotor plane. Due to the Glauert model, efficiency {{is below the}} <b>Betz</b> <b>limit,</b> and asymptotically approaches this limit when the tip speed ratio goes to infinity.|$|E
5000|$|U4 is {{introduced}} {{here as the}} wind velocity in the far wake. This is important because the power extracted from the turbine {{is defined by the}} following equation. However the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> is given in terms of the coefficient of power [...] The coefficient of power is similar to efficiency but not the same. The formula for the coefficient of power is given beneath the formula for power: ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> {{is defined}} by the maximum value that can be given by the above formula. This is found by taking the {{derivative}} with respect to the axial induction factor, setting it to zero and solving for the axial induction factor. Betz was able to show that the optimum axial induction factor is one third. The optimum axial induction factor was then used to find the maximum coefficient of power. This maximum coefficient is the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit.</b> Betz was able to show that the maximum coefficient of power of a wind turbine is 16/27. Airflow operating at higher thrust will cause the axial induction factor to rise above the optimum value. Higher thrust cause more air to be deflected away from the turbine. When the axial induction factor falls below the optimum value the wind turbine is not extracting all the energy it can. This reduces pressure around the turbine and allows more air to pass through the turbine, but not enough to account for the lack of energy being extracted.|$|E
50|$|The {{derivation}} of the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> shows {{a simple}} analysis of wind turbine aerodynamics. In reality {{there is a}} lot more. A more rigorous analysis would include wake rotation, the effect of variable geometry. The effect of airfoils on the flow is a major component of wind turbine aerodynamics. Within airfoils alone, the wind turbine aerodynamicist has to consider the effect of surface roughness, dynamic stall tip losses, solidity, among other problems.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> has no {{dependence}} on the geometry of the wind extraction system, therefore S may take any form provided that the flow travels from {{the entrance to the}} control volume to the exit, and the control volume has uniform entry and exit velocities. Any extraneous effects can only decrease the performance of the system (usually a turbine) since this analysis was idealized to disregard friction. Any non-ideal effects would detract from the energy available in the incoming fluid, lowering the overall efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Essentially {{increasing}} system {{economic efficiency}} results from increased production per unit, measured per square meter of vane exposure. An increase in system efficiency {{is required to}} bring down the cost of electrical power production measured in kWh. Efficiency increases {{may be the result of}} engineering of the wind capture devices, such as the configuration and dynamics of wind turbines, that may push the power generation from these systems into higher levels of the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit.</b> System efficiency increases in power application, transmission or storage may also contribute to a lower cost of power per unit.|$|E
50|$|As wind is free (no fuel cost), wind-to-rotor {{efficiency}} (including {{rotor blade}} friction and drag) {{is one of}} many aspects impacting the final price of wind power.Further inefficiencies, such as gearbox losses, generator and converter losses, reduce the power delivered by a wind turbine. To protect components from undue wear, extracted power is held constant above the rated operating speed as theoretical power increases at the cube of wind speed, further reducing theoretical efficiency. In 2001, commercial utility-connected turbines deliver 75% to 80% of the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> of power extractable from the wind, at rated operating speed.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} to {{deriving}} the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> is applying conservation of angular momentum. As stated above the wind loses speed after the wind turbine compared to the speed {{far away from the}} turbine. This would violate the conservation of momentum if the wind turbine was not applying a thrust force on the flow. This thrust force manifests itself through the pressure drop across the rotor. The front operates at high pressure while the back operates at low pressure. The pressure difference from the front to back causes the thrust force. The momentum lost in the turbine is balanced by the thrust force.|$|E

Lanchester was {{the first}} to study this {{phenomenon}} in application to ship propellers, five years later Nikolai Yegorovich Zhukovsky and Albert Betz independently arrived at the same results. It is believed that each researcher was not aware of the others' work because of World War I and the Bolshevik Revolution. Thus formally, the proceeding limit should be referred to as the Lanchester-Betz-Joukowsky limit. In general Albert Betz is credited for this accomplishment because he published his work in a journal that had a wider circulation, while the other two published it in the publication associated with their respective institution, thus it is widely known as simply the <b>Betz</b> <b>Limit.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Betz's law {{indicates}} the maximum power {{that can be}} extracted from the wind, independent of {{the design of a}} wind turbine in open flow. It was published in 1919, by the German physicist Albert Betz. The law is derived from the principles of conservation of mass and momentum of the air stream flowing through an idealized [...] "actuator disk" [...] that extracts energy from the wind stream. According to Betz's law, no turbine can capture more than 16/27 (59.3%) of the kinetic energy in wind. The factor 16/27 (0.593) is known as Betz's coefficient.

40|$|Because {{compressibility}} effects {{arise in}} real applications of propellers and turbines, the Actuator Disk Theory or Froude’s Momentum Theory was established for compressible, subsonic flow using the three laws of conservation and isentropic thermodynamics. The compressible Actuator Disk Theory was {{established for the}} unducted (bare) and ducted {{cases in which the}} disk was treated as the only assembly within the flow stream in the bare case and enclosed by a duct having a constant cross-sectional area equal to the disk area in the ducted case. The primary motivation of the current thesis was to predict the ideal performance of a small ram-air turbine (microRAT), operating at high subsonic Mach numbers, that would power an autonomous Boundary Layer Data System during test flights. The compressible-flow governing equations were applied to a propeller and a turbine for both the bare and ducted cases. The solutions to the resulting system of coupled, non-linear, algebraic equations were obtained using an iterative approach. The results showed that the power extraction efficiency and the total drag coefficient of the bare turbine are slightly higher for compressible flow than for incompressible flow. As the free-stream Mach increases, the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> of the compressible bare turbine slightly increases from the incompressible value of 0. 593 and occurs at a velocity ratio between the far downstream and the free-stream that is lower than the incompressible value of 0. 333. From incompressible to a free-stream Mach number of 0. 8, the <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> increases by 0. 021 while its corresponding velocity ratio decreases by 0. 036. The <b>Betz</b> <b>limit</b> and its corresponding velocity ratio for the ducted turbine are not affected by the free-stream Mach and are the same for both incompressible and compressible flow. The total drag coefficient of the ducted turbine is also the same regardless of the free-stream Mach number and the compressibility of the flow; but, the individual contributions of the turbine drag and the lip thrust to the total drag differs between compressible and incompressible flow and between varying free-stream Mach numbers. It was concluded that overall compressibility has little influence on the ideal performance of an actuator disk...|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{conventional}} hydro and tidal barrage installations, water current turbines in {{open flow}} can generate power from flowing water with almost zero environmental impact, over {{a much wider}} range of sites than those available for conventional tidal power generation. Recent developments in current turbine design are reviewed and some potential advantages of ducted or “diffuser-augmented ” current turbines are explored. These include improved safety, protection from weed growth, increased power output and reduced turbine and gearbox size for a given power output. Ducted turbines {{are not subject to}} the so-called <b>Betz</b> <b>limit,</b> which defines an upper limit of 59. 3 % of the incident kinetic energy that can be converted to shaft power by a single actuator disk turbine in open flow. For ducted turbines the theoretical limit depends on (i) the pressure difference that can be created between duct inlet and outlet, and (ii) the volumetric flow through the duct. These factors in turn depend on the shape of the duct and the ratio of duct area to turbine area.
