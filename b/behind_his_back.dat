5|$|Although most of {{the figures}} are generic {{representations}} of human forms in various walks and stages of life, Taft included himself, {{with one of his}} assistants following him, along {{the west side of the}} sculpture. He is portrayed wearing a smock, with his head bowed and hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> His daughters served as models for some of the figures.|$|E
5|$|No {{images of}} Murrell survive. Accounts {{describe}} him as a short man who walked with his hands <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> and hummed as he went. He was also noted for wearing a hard hat, bobbed tale coat, and iron goggles, while carrying a whalebone umbrella and a basket into which he placed the herbs that he collected. His appearance reportedly scared local children, of whom he was nevertheless fond.|$|E
5|$|In France, Champollion's success also {{produced}} enemies. Edmé-Francois Jomard was chief among them, and he spared no occasion to belittle Champollion's achievements <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> {{pointing out that}} Champollion {{had never been to}} Egypt and suggesting that really his lettre represented no major progress from Young's work. Jomard had been insulted by Champollion's demonstration of the young age of the Dendera zodiac, which he had himself proposed was as old as 15,000 years. This exact finding had also brought Champollion in the good graces of the Catholic Church which had been antagonized by the claims that Egyptian civilization might be older than the church-sanctioned chronology according to which the earth was only 6,000 years old.|$|E

5|$|The Sooners had {{the ball}} first in overtime, with Adrian Peterson scoring on their first play. Boise State then drove the ball toward the goal line, but faced fourth-and-two from the five yard line. They then sent quarterback Jared Zabransky into motion and snapped to backup wide {{receiver}} Vinny Peretta, who ran an option pass and found Derek Schouman in the end zone. The Broncos chose {{to go for the}} two-point conversion and the win instead of kicking for the tie. They then ran a Statue of Liberty play, with Zabransky faking a pass to the right side and handing the ball <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> to Ian Johnson, who ran left and entered the end zone untouched, giving the Broncos a stunning 4342 win.|$|E
5|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{released}} on December 24, 2010. It was directed by Don Tyler, who previously worked on videos for the bands A Day to Remember and Flyleaf. It was digitally released on June 14, 2011 via iTunes Store and the same day was also uploaded on the band's Vevo channel on YouTube. Shot in an animated technique, the video starts with an animated version of lead singer Levine singing on a microphone while hands are <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> touching his body. As the video progresses, a nude animated woman is shown dancing around him and flirting with {{the other members of}} the band. Several animation effects such as angel wings and devil elements are shown behind Levine as he is singing, while the woman is also dancing for the other members. The video finishes with a close shot of Levine's face.|$|E
5|$|After Pipe's speech, Crawford was {{stripped}} naked and beaten. His hands were tied <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> and a rope was tied {{from his hands}} to a post in the ground. A large fire was lit {{about six or seven}} yards (6 m) from the pole. Indian men shot charges of gunpowder into Crawford's body, then cut off his ears. Crawford was poked with burning pieces of wood from the fire, and hot coals were thrown at him, which he was compelled to walk on. Crawford begged Girty to shoot him, but Girty was unwilling or afraid to intervene. After about two hours of torture, Crawford fell down unconscious. He was scalped, and a woman poured hot coals over his head, which revived him. He began to walk about insensibly as the torture continued. After he finally died, his body was burned.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain {{anticipated}} that Labour would legislate for two years, then seek {{a general election}} and be returned with {{a majority of the}} seats. Were this to occur, he would be 67 when that term expired, and according to him perhaps too old to hold office. With no ministerial responsibilities, he departed on a three-month tour of East Africa, hoping it might be useful were he to serve in future as Colonial Secretary. As the minority Labour Government attempted to grapple with the onset of the Depression, the Conservative Party indulged in a period of internecine warfare, with Baldwin under attack in the Parliamentary Party and in the press for losing the election, and for being too moderate. Chamberlain attempted to mediate between the press lords and Baldwin, only to learn that the newspaper owners had been trying to influence local constituency organisations <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> During the leadership crisis, Chamberlain persuaded Conservative Party chairman John Davidson to resign to relieve the pressure on Baldwin. Chamberlain took the vacant chair himself.|$|E
5|$|Most of Fielding's plays {{were written}} in five acts, but The Author's Farce was written in three. The opening {{introduces}} the main character, Harry Luckless, and his attempts to woo Harriot, the daughter of his landlady Mrs. Moneywood. The play begins {{in much the same}} way as Fielding's earlier romance-themed comedies, but quickly becomes a different type of play, mocking the literary and theatrical establishment. Luckless is trying to become a successful writer, but lacks the income that would allow him to concentrate on his writing. Although others try to support him financially, Luckless refuses their help; when his friend, Witmore, pays his rent <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> Luckless steals the money from Mrs. Moneywood. In the second act, Luckless seeks assistance to help finish his play, The Pleasures of the Town, but is poorly advised, and the work is rejected by his local theatre. Luckless revises his play and succeeds in finding an alternative venue, leading to the third act, in which the work is performed as a puppet show, with actors taking the place of the puppets.|$|E
5|$|Nash {{himself was}} asked by the College to design a new {{building}} near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College. At the same time the College also asked Robert Abraham to submit to them a second plan for the building. When Nash heard that another architect was approached <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> he reacted vehemently, and attacked the heralds. The College nevertheless continued with their plans. However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed to build a new building. By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the College to drop the matter altogether. By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham to build a new octagonal-shaped Record Room {{on the site of the}} old Sugar House.|$|E

5|$|Nauendorf {{continued}} his raids, the soldiers foraged {{for food and}} dug up the local potato crop, and Joseph and Frederick glared at one another by Königgrätz. Maria Theresa had sent Kaunitz on a secret mission to Berlin to offer a truce. In a second trip, she offered a settlement, and finally wrote to Catherine in Russia to ask for assistance. When Joseph discovered his mother's maneuvering <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> he furiously offered to resign. His mother enlisted the assistance she needed. Catherine offered to mediate the dispute; if her assistance was unacceptable, {{she was willing to}} send fifty thousand troops to augment the Prussian force, {{despite the fact that she}} disliked Frederick and her alliance with him was strictly defensive. Frederick withdrew portions of his force in mid-September. In October, Joseph withdrew most of his army to the Bohemian border and Frederick withdrew his remaining troops into Prussia. Two small forces of hussars and dragoons remained in Bohemia to provide a winter cordon; these forces allowed Joseph and Frederick to keep an eye on each other while their diplomats negotiated at Teschen.|$|E
5|$|The {{two main}} deities found in Hoysala temple {{sculpture}} are Shiva and Vishnu in their various forms and avatars (incarnations). Shiva is usually shown with four arms holding a trident {{and a small}} drum among other emblems that symbolise objects worshiped independently of the divine image {{with which they are}} associated. Any male icon portrayed in this way is Shiva although a female icon may sometimes be portrayed with these attributes as Shiva's consort, Parvati. Various depictions of Lord Shiva exist: showing him naked (fully or partially), in action such as slaying a demon (Andhaka) or dancing on the head of a slain elephant (Gajasura) and holding its skin up <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> He is often accompanied by his consort Parvati or shown with Nandi the bull. He may be represented as Bhairava, another of Shiva's many manifestations.|$|E
5|$|Blaine had briefly {{joined the}} Cheerios {{when it looked}} like New Directions would be {{disbanding}} after their Sectionals loss, and cheerleading coach Sue (Jane Lynch) blackmails Blaine into rejoining; Blaine and Sam hatch up a plan to bring Sue down from the inside. Blaine eventually confesses to Sam that he has feelings for him, to which Sam assures him that he is somewhat flattered by Blaine's honesty and attraction, and that it would not change the fact that Blaine is still Sam's best friend. Blaine still loves Kurt and asks Burt for his permission to propose to Kurt, but Burt tells him they're too young to marry, and advises him to wait. Blaine remains determined, however, and while shopping for a ring, he meets Jan (Patty Duke), a lesbian jeweler who has been with her partner Liz (Meredith Baxter) for over thirty years. Jan offers to be a mentor to him, and Blaine and Kurt later have dinner with Jan and Liz, where Jan and Liz explain how their relationship evolved over the years and their experience with the growing mainstream acceptance of gay people. New Directions wins at Regionals, and Will and Emma get married immediately afterward, with the glee club, plus some graduates including Kurt, in attendance. Blaine is shown, after the ceremony is over, holding a jewelry box <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, psychiatry is {{the only}} medical specialty in which the doctor is given the right to violence {{for the benefit of}} the patient. The application of violence must be based on the mental health law, must be as much as possible transparent and monitored by representatives of the interests of persons who are in need of involuntary examination and treatment. While being hospitalized in a psychiatric hospital for urgent indications, the patient should be accompanied by his relatives, witnesses, or other persons authorized to control the actions of doctors and law-enforcement agencies. Otherwise, psychiatry becomes an obedient maid for administrative and governmental agencies and is deprived of its medical function. It is the police that must come to the aid of citizens and is responsible for their security. Only later, after the appropriate legal measures for social protection have been taken, the psychiatrist must respond to the queries of law enforcement and judicial authorities by solving the issues of involuntary hospitalization, sanity, etc. In Russia, all that goes by opposites. The psychiatrist is vested with punitive functions, is involved in involuntary hospitalization, the state machine hides <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back,</b> actually manipulating the doctor. The police are reluctant to investigate offences committed by the mentally ill. After receiving the information about their disease, the bodies of inquiry very often stop the investigation and do not bring it to the level of investigative actions. Thereby psychiatry becomes a cloak for the course of justice and, by doing so, serves as a source for the rightlessness and stigmatization of both psychiatrists and persons with mental disorders. The negative attitude to psychiatrists is thereby supported by the state machine and is accompanied by the aggression against the doctors, which increases during the periods of social unrest.|$|E
5|$|The novel recaps Penelope's life in {{hindsight}} from 21st century Hades; she recalls her family life in Sparta, {{her marriage to}} Odysseus, her dealing with suitors during his absence, and the aftermath of Odysseus' return. The relationship with her parents was challenging: her father became overly affectionate after attempting to murder her, and her mother was absent-minded and negligent. At fifteen, Penelope married Odysseus, who had rigged the contest that decided which suitor would marry her. Penelope was happy with him, {{even though he was}} mocked <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back</b> by Helen and some maids for his short stature and lesser developed home, Ithaca. The couple broke with tradition by moving to the husband's kingdom. In Ithaca, neither Odysseus' mother Anticleia, nor his nurse Eurycleia, liked Penelope but eventually Eurycleia helped Penelope settle into her new role and became friendly, but often patronising. Shortly after the birth of their son, Telemachus, Odysseus was called to war, leaving Penelope to run the kingdom and raise Telemachus alone. News of the war and rumours of Odysseus' journey back sporadically reached Ithaca and with the growing possibility that Odysseus was not returning an increasing number of suitors moved in to court Penelope. Convinced the suitors were more interested in controlling her kingdom than loving her, she stalled them. The suitors pressured her by consuming and wasting much of the kingdom's resources. She feared violence if she outright denied their offer of marriage so she announced she would make her decision on which to marry once she finished her father-in-law's shroud. She enlisted twelve maids to help her unravel the shroud at night and spy on the suitors. Odysseus eventually returned but in disguise. Penelope recognised him immediately and instructed her maids not to reveal his identity. After the suitors were massacred, Odysseus instructed Telemachus to execute the maids who he believed were in league with them. Twelve were hanged while Penelope slept. Afterwards, Penelope and Odysseus told each other stories of their time apart, but {{on the issue of the}} maids Penelope remained silent to avoid the appearance of sympathy for those already judged and condemned as traitors.|$|E
5|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{released}} on 3 July 2006. Having been directed by Sophie Muller, it contained a vengeance theme, {{similar to that of}} the song. It starts off with Allen sitting on the bed in her apartment, eating chocolate and cheeseballs. Interleaved, there are shots of her and her ex-boyfriend spending time together appear as a memory. He is played by Elliott Jordan. As the bridge comes up, the scene changes to the singer standing on the corner of a street, talking to a man and paying him money. The man leaves and goes to some gangsters, giving them instructions and each a share of money. As Allen's former lover walks down the street talking on his mobile phone, one of the gangsters pushes him into an abandoned playground; where they are joined by a second gangster, and the pair give Allen's ex a beating. In this time, Allen, witnessing the scene, smiles. She then meets with her bruised ex-boyfriend, and takes him to a coffee shop. There, he tried to explain to her how he was beaten by the muggers, not knowing that, meanwhile, they were breaking down his apartment door and destroying his furniture and possessions, including scratching his gramophone records. The ex-boyfriend leaves the table for a while, enough time for Allen to put laxative pills in his coffee; upon returning, he drinks it and leaves the shop. After, he goes to his apartment, only to find it trashed and destroyed. Scavenging through what's left, he happily finds the record box, thinking they are intact, but he suddenly gets diarrhoea as a result of the laxatives, but is unable to use his toilet, as it is clogged with his clothes. He goes to Allen's apartment with his records, seeking consolation, unaware that she is laughing <b>behind</b> <b>his</b> <b>back.</b> As the video finishes, the scene changes to Allen walking down the street, at night, smiling, singing the last chorus, while her ex-boyfriend, actually a disc jockey, is in a nightclub, getting ready to put his music, but finds out that all his records have been scratched.|$|E
