The {{imprinter}} <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> {{is under}} very high linear pressure during the work, which often causes wear and damage between <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> and anvil roller. Traditionally, the extra strength design method is frequently {{used in the}} design of imprinter <b>bottom</b> <b>roller,</b> which leads to the waste of materials and increase of weights. So, reasonable processing craft and appropriate theoretical analysis method should be adopted to improve the manufacturing of <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> and make the material strength into full use, in the condition of meeting the structure safety standard. This paper gives a brief analysis of the process craft of <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> and uses finite element technique to give the <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> numerical simulation and FEA of its deflection and strength. The results show that: in the process of work, the distribution of stress changes largely and unevenly. The stress and deformation in middle part prove the largest with decreasing to both sides successively. The imprinter <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> produces a maximum displacement of 0. 0516 mm, which meets the work requirements...|$|E

The constituent fibers in the ring-spinning triangle are considered as three-dimensional elastic beam elements with tensile, compressive, torsional, and bending capabilities. The accuracy of the proposed FEM model in calculating the fiber tension distribution of the spinning triangle has been validated by comparing it with earlier models and experimental data. Compared with the earlier models, some important theoretical factors ignored previously, including the fiber torsional strain and the frictional contact of fibers with the <b>bottom</b> <b>roller,</b> are considered in the current model.

40|$|A {{three-dimensional}} particle-level {{simulation method}} is developed to simulate fiber dynamics {{in the ring}} spinning triangle. The fiber is modeled as a chain of beads connected through massless rods, and its flexibility {{is defined by the}} stretching, bending and twisting displacements. As the application of the proposed approach, the effects of the chitosan (CS) /cotton (CT) fiber initial position and length on fiber motion and yarn properties are discussed. The deflections of CS fibers along the roller axis are larger compared with those of CT fibers, which will lead to CS migrating outwards in CS/CT blended yarn. The short CS fibers (22 mm) will move toward the top roller surface and shift quickly out of the roller nip, and thus yarn strength is lower. The tailing end of the longest CS fiber (46 mm) will drift off the roller nip, which makes little or no contribution to the yarn strength. For 38 mm length CS fiber, it moves toward the <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> surface and is bound into the roller nip, and thus can produce the highest tenacity CS/CT blended yarns. The simulation results agree with the spinning experimental data reported by other researchers.

40|$|The {{spinning}} triangle is {{a critical}} region in the spinning process of yarn. Its geometry influences the fiber tension distribution and thus affects the properties of spun yarns. In conventional ring spinning, on the one hand, the spinning triangles are often asymmetric due to the frictional contacts of fibers with the <b>bottom</b> <b>roller,</b> which interferes with the twist propagation into the spinning triangle zone, and thus leads to the migration of the axis fiber at the front roller nip. On the other hand, the yarn spinning tension has an obvious angle with the vertical axis perpendicular to the nip line. Therefore, in this paper, a theoretical model of the fiber tension distributions in the general spinning triangle has been proposed by considering both the inclination angle of the spinning tension and the migration of the axis fiber at the front roller nip according {{to the principle of}} minimum potential energy. Two shape parameters were introduced to describe the skew level of the geometry of the spinning triangle in the analysis. The effects of shapes of the spinning triangle on the fiber tension distributions were investigated. The results show that the fiber tension distribution at the spinning triangle tends to more non-uniformity with increasing the asymmetry of the spinning triangle. The effects of both shape par-ameters on the fiber tension distributions are similar under the assumption that the spinning triangle height H is constant. In addition, a more long-narrow shape of the spinning triangle shows more uniform fiber distributions. Keyword...|$|E

With an output of 32. 9 million tons in 2009, spun yarns satisfy more than half the needs of the global textiles and clothing industry. The present study is devoted to developing computational and digital methods and systems for the accurate and efficient analysis of three predominant aspects of spun yarns: yarn formation, internal structure and surface appearance. In this study, a new generalized theoretical model has been developed by using Finite Element Method (FEM) for the theoretical and numerical analysis of yarn formation in spinning triangle. In this proposed model, the initial conditions are formulated together with an algorithm for fiber buckling. Compared with the earlier models, some important parameters ignored previously, such as inclined angle of spinning tension, frictional contact of fibers with <b>bottom</b> <b>roller</b> and fiber torsional strains, are considered. Numerical simulations were then carried out to explore the quantitative relationships between the mechanical performance of ring spinning triangle and various spinning parameters. Further comparison results showed that fiber tensions predicted by the proposed model are in good agreements with earlier models while the calculated torque of yarns is generally closer to experimental measurements. Moreover, a dynamic model of spinning triangle has been further developed in this study based on the above static FEM model with consideration of the dynamic characteristics of fiber inertia and damping for a more complete and accurate description. By this model, the dynamic behavior of fibers in spinning triangle, such as the natural frequency, mode shape, resonant response, harmonic analysis and response under a time-varying tension, has been originally studied. The results showed that dynamic parameters have a great influence on the amplitude and attenuation of the response of constituent fibers in spinning triangle. Tracer fiber measurement has been widely used for analysis of yarn internal structure by tracing the fiber path in a transparent liquid. Currently, the image mosaic and segmentation of tracer fiber images largely involve manual operation. It is extremely time-consuming. Therefore, in this study, an intelligent computer method has been developed for automatic mosaic and segmentation of tracer fiber images. In this method, an extended QRS complex detection method is developed for tracer fiber detection. A decision function, integrating several matching functions extracted from tracer fiber and gradient image, is proposed for image mosaic. An objective method is then proposed to evaluate the qualities of image mosaic and segmentation of the proposed method. Fifty series of tracer fiber images (total 872 images) with five different yarn counts (10 Ne~ 60 Ne) were prepared and used for a full evaluation of the proposed image processing method with respect to conventional manual method. Evaluation results showed that the proposed method works well in mosaic and segmentation for tracer fiber images and presents a much higher efficiency than the conventional method. For yarn surface evaluation, an intelligent computer method has been developed to analyze yarn blackboard image and objectively evaluate yarn quality using computer vision and artificial intelligence. The evaluation method for yarn surface quality currently in use is mainly based on manual inspection. Although some works have been done on digital yarn analysis in order to resolve the limitations of human visual inspection, none of them can fully imitate human behavior in the inspection of yarn quality on a blackboard according to ASTM D 2255 standard. In the proposed method, a multi-scale attention model is proposed and developed, which can fully imitate human attention at different observation distances for the whole and detailed yarn information. A Spectral Residual method is then extended to establish a general benchmark for the comparison among different grade yarns. In the developed system, Fourier transform is employed to separate yarn diameter and hairs, and image conspicuity is obtained by the multi-scale attention model. Total sixteen features, obtained from yarn diameter, hairiness and image conspicuity, are extracted to present the yarn surface characteristics and then used to classify and grade yarn surface qualities using Probabilistic Neural Network (PNN). Two kinds of PNNs, i. e. global and individual PNNs, and two types of classification, i. e. eight-grade and five-grade classifications, are designed and developed for various yarn quality classification purposes. For the evaluation of the proposed method, a database was constructed with 296 yarn board images, covering eight yarn counts (7 Ne~ 80 Ne) and different grades. Experimental results showed that the accuracy for eight-and five-grade global PNNs are 92. 23 % and 93. 58 %, respectively, demonstrating a good classification performance of the proposed digital method in yarn surface grading. Finally, with the above developed computer methods, two intelligent digital systems have been developed for the computerized analysis and evaluation of yarn internal structure and surface appearance, respectively. The systems were designed for controlling and visualizing the whole process of yarn measurement and analysis, covering image acquisition, image processing and data analysis with interactive and user-friendly interface. Both digital systems are potential for application in textile laboratories and spinning mills for yarn structure and surface analyses. Institute of Textiles and ClothingPh.

The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. For each spindle, the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread.

In this conical bending process, the blank is given static bending {{by placing the}} blank over the <b>bottom</b> <b>rollers</b> and lowering the top roller.

Static bending of the plate requires larger force and it is done in multiple stages to lower down the value of required force [Gajjar et. al., 2008].

In this paper an analytical model is proposed for the prediction of bending force during the multiple pass 3 -roller conical bending. Multipass bending experiments are carried out to validate the developed model. Experimental results do not match exactly with the analytical results. So a correction factor for each pass has been found out and applied to the analytical results. The corrected analytical results match with experimental results quite satisfactorily. The model derived can be effectively used to study the effect of various parameters on the bending force and can be helpful to the researchers working in this area...|$|R
