5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models <b>by</b> <b>only</b> allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six directions of motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, Philip W. Cook {{conducted}} a study of 55,000 members of the United States Armed Forces, finding bidirectionality in 60-64% of IPV cases, as reported by both men and women. The 2001 National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health found that 49.7% of IPV cases were reciprocal and 50.3% were non-reciprocal. When data provided <b>by</b> men <b>only</b> was analyzed, 46.9% of cases were reported as reciprocal and 53.1% as non-reciprocal. When data provided <b>by</b> women <b>only</b> was analyzed, 51.3% of cases were reported as reciprocal and 49.7% as non-reciprocal. The overall data showed 70.7% of non-reciprocal IPV cases were perpetrated <b>by</b> women <b>only</b> (74.9% when reported by men; 67.7% when reported by women) and 29.3% were perpetrated <b>by</b> men <b>only</b> (25.1% when reported by men; 32.3% when reported by women). The 2006 thirty-two nation International Dating Violence Study [...] "revealed an overwhelming body of evidence that bidirectional violence is the predominant pattern of perpetration; and this ... indicates that the etiology of IPV is mostly parallel for men and women." [...] The survey found for [...] "any physical violence," [...] a rate of 31.2%, of which 68.6% was bidirectional, 9.9% was perpetrated <b>by</b> men <b>only,</b> and 21.4% <b>by</b> women <b>only.</b> For severe assault, a rate of 10.8% was found, of which 54.8% was bidirectional, 15.7% perpetrated <b>by</b> men <b>only,</b> and 29.4% <b>by</b> women <b>only.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bromine has {{sometimes}} been considered to be possibly essential in humans, but this is supported <b>by</b> <b>only</b> limited circumstantial evidence, and no clear biological role. As a pharmaceutical, the simple bromide ion (Br−) has inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, and bromide salts were once a major medical sedative, before replacement by shorter-acting drugs. They retain niche uses as antiepileptics.|$|E

5|$|Emilia Martins' 1998 study {{compared}} the head-bob displays {{from the source}} population on Cuba with these animals on Isla Magueyes.

The rapid change in display structure between the colony of animals on Isla Magueyes and those on Cuba illustrated the potential of small founding population size as a catalyst to evolution with regard to communication or display.
