25|$|In 1880, Ewing {{organized}} {{a school of}} cookery in Chicago and conducted it for three years, when she was appointed professor of domestic economy in the Iowa Agricultural College. She held that position until 1887, and then resigned to accept a similar one, at a largely-increased salary, in Purdue University, Indiana. In the fall of 1889, she resigned her professorship in Purdue University and went to Kansas City, Missouri to organize and take charge of a school of household science; but before she had <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> year the calls upon her from all sections {{of the country for}} lectures and lessons on culinary topics became so incessant and urgent that she resolved to leave the school, replacing her position with someone else.|$|E
25|$|At {{the other}} depot, at Voldsminde, {{the company had}} a fleet of 19 trams and four trailers. During the night and morning, these were {{immediately}} taken into service. Some were not in proper operating condition, having been untouched since 1951, while others had only <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> year. In {{the course of the}} day, eleven of the trams were made available for operation. One of the Class 5 bogie trams that was still in regular service had survived because it had overnighted in the other depot. All the ten Class 2 and seven of the Class 3 trams could be put into service {{in the course of a}} few days. Behind the fire-proof doors at the paint shop at Dalsenget was a single Class 4 tram with a trailer that had survived the fire.|$|E
500|$|At {{the start}} of the 2003–04 season, Iginla was named the 18th captain in Flames {{franchise}} history, and 14th since the team moved to Calgary from Atlanta in 1980. His predecessor as captain, Craig Conroy, cited Iginla's experience and leadership for his decision to relinquish the captaincy. [...] "He was a leader on that team and old enough to where he'd <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> long time. It was time for him. He took us to the Stanley Cup Final that year so it worked out pretty well." [...] Iginla was reported to be the first black captain in NHL history, though former Blackhawks captain Dirk Graham, who is of African descent, has also been said to hold that honour.|$|E

500|$|Kyle Busch {{appeared}} in Victory Lane {{to celebrate his}} first victory of the season; the win earned him $198,550. He said, [...] "I don't {{know how many times}} I spun out and didn't spin out. Amazing race. It was fun to drive when I wasn't getting turned around", and, [...] "Stab and steer, stab and steer, That's what you do. And some brakes. There are brakes involved, too. I thought I was clear... and I tried going down slowly, and Jimmie just must have <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> little bit, turned me sideways and got me on the apron—scared everybody half to death, including me." [...] Stewart, who finished second, said, [...] "I actually had fun racing at Daytona again, which I haven't had for a while. I don't know what the consensus is from everybody else, but I had more fun as a driver tonight than what we've had in the past." [...] Ambrose, who finished third in the race, explained, [...] "It's definitely a lot more fun, more entertaining for the fans, and more in control for the drivers." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gordon {{was sent}} to Cheltenham College in 1841 {{when he was only}} seven, but after he had <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> year he {{was sent to}} a school kept by the Rev. Samuel Ollis Garrard in Gloucestershire. He {{attended}} the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich in 1848, where he was a contemporary and friend of Charles George Gordon (no relation, later 'Gordon of Khartoum') and Thomas Bland Strange (later known as [...] "Gunner Jingo"). There Gordon appears to have been good at sports, but not studious and certainly undisciplined – [...] and like Richard Henry Horne, he was asked to leave. Gordon was again admitted a pupil at Cheltenham College. He was not there for long – he appears to have left in the middle of 1852 – but the story that he was expelled from Cheltenham is without foundation. Then Gordon was sent to the Royal Grammar School Worcester in 1852. Gordon began to lead a wild and aimless life, contracted debts, and was a great anxiety to his father, who at last decided that his son should go to Australia and make a fresh start in 1853 to join the mounted police with a letter of introduction to the Governor.|$|E

2500|$|There {{were reports}} {{that the number of}} {{residents}} increased by 60% during the 1990s to about 25,000 although a second estimate (based on the 2000 census based on a different map) places the residential (nighttime and weekend) population in 2000 at 12,042. By 2001 there were several grocery stores, dry cleaners, and two grade schools and a top high school. There is a barber shop across from the New York Stock Exchange which has <b>been</b> <b>there</b> <b>a</b> long time. By 2001 there were more signs of dogwalkers at night and a 24-hour neighborhood, although the general pattern of crowds during the working hours and emptiness at night was still apparent. There were ten hotels and thirteen museums by 2001. Stuyvesant High School moved to its present location near Battery Park City in 1992 and has been described as one of the nation's premier high schools with emphasis on science and mathematics. In 2007 the French fashion retailer Hermès opened a store in the financial district to sell items such as a [...] "$4,700 custom-made leather dressage saddle or a $47,000 limited edition alligator briefcase". Some streets have been designated as pedestrian–only with vehicular traffic prohibited at some times. There are reports of panhandlers like elsewhere in the city. By 2010 the residential population had increased to 24,400 residents with crime statistics showing no murders in 2010. The area is growing with luxury high-end apartments and upscale retailers.|$|E
