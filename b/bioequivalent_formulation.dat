40|$|Objective: The {{aim of this}} multicentric {{prospective}} study was to evaluate the efficacy of a new <b>bioequivalent</b> <b>formulation</b> of oseltamivir {{for the treatment of}} influenza A, influenza B and H 1 N 1 during the 2010 - 2011 influenza season. Materials and Methods: We compared the symptoms and signs of 300 pediatric patients presenting to three University hospitals with an influenza-like illness, between January and March 2011. Nasal swab specimens were collected from all children and tested by reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for influenza viruses. After randomization, half of the participants were prescribed oseltamivir, while the other half were observed conservatively. Forty patients who were followed-up for influenza prior to the study were also included into the evaluation. Results: Influenza was confirmed by RT-PCR in 129 children, 71 of whom were prescribed oseltamivir. The durations of symptoms such as fever, cough, nasal congestion and rhinorrhea were significantly shorter for patients who were treated with oseltamivir compared with untreated patients (for all symptoms p< 0. 002). Early initiation of oseltamivir therapy (within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms) was associated with more favorable outcomes and a earlier recovery than in patients for whom treatment was delayed (beyond 48 hours). Thirty-seven patients (28. 6 %) had H 1 N 1, 44 (34. 1 %) had influenza A, 46 (35. 6 %) had influenza B, 1 (0. 75 %) had H 1 N 1 plus influenza A and 1 (0. 75 %) had influenza A plus influenza B viruses. In the comparison of the duration of symptoms in different virus types, a statistically significant difference was only observed in patients with influenza B, who had a longer duration of cough (p< 0. 001), nasal congestion (p< 0. 001) and rhinorrhea (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Oseltamivir is an effective treatment for the management of seasonal influenza and H 1 N 1, and should be initiated immediately without waiting for laboratory confirmation of diagnosis...|$|E

40|$|According to {{the current}} bioavailabilityhioequivalence {{regulations}} by the Food arid Drug Administration (FDA), comparison of mean bioequivalence values between two formulations of the same drug in pharmacokinetic studies is suflcient for approval of the new formulation in a new drug application. Intrasubject variability ofpharmacokinetic parameters may still statistically differ between two <b>bioequivalent</b> <b>formulations</b> which cannot be proven based on the typical 2 x 2 crossover design if no repeated measures for the same formulation can be evaluated. When repeated meaures are required in a study protocol, a parallel group study design may be preferred over a crossover study design due to a pharmacological a d o r clinical reason.

40|$|Objectives To use growth mixture {{modelling}} (GMM) {{to identify}} subgroups {{of children with}} attention deficit hyperactive disorder (ADHD) who have different pharmacodynamic profiles in response to extended release methylphenidate as assessed in a laboratory classroom setting. Methods GMM analysis was performed on data from the COMACS study (Comparison of Methylphenidates in the Analog Classroom Setting) : a large (n = 184) placebo-controlled cross-over study comparing three treatment conditions in the Laboratory School Protocol (with a 1. 5 -h cycle of attention and deportment assessments). Two orally administered, once-daily methylphenidate (MPH) <b>bioequivalent</b> <b>formulations</b> [Metadate CD™/Equasym™ XL (MCD-EQXL) and Concerta XL (CON) ] were compared with placebo (PLA). Results Three classes of children with distinct severity profiles in the PLA condition were identified. For both MCD-EQXL and CON, the more severe their PLA symptoms the better, the children’s response. However, the formulations produced different growth curves by class, with CON having essentially a flat profile for all three classes (i. e. no effect of PLA severity) and MCD-EQXL showing a marked decline in symptoms immediately post-dosing in the two most severe classes compared with the least severe. Comparison of daily doses matched for immediate-release (IR) components accounted for this difference. Conclusion The results suggest considerable heterogeneity in the pharmacodynamics of MPH response by children with ADHD. When treatment response for near-equal, bioequivalent daily doses the two formulations was compared, marked differences were seen for children in the most severe classes with a strong curvilinear trajectory for MCD-EQXL related to the greater IR component...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackground:In the {{treatment}} of hypertension, combination therapy is important 10 because antihypertensive monotherapy is effective in only 40 % of patients worldwide. Amlodipine is a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker with a slow onset and long duration of action. Benazepril hydrochloride is a prodrug hydrolyzed by esterase to the active metabolite benazeprilat, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor. In 1995, the US Food and Drug Administration approved {{the use of a}} capsule formulation of combination amlodipine-benazepril for hypertension. Objective:The aim {{of this study was to}} compare the bioavailability and tolerability 10 of the capsule formulation with those of a tablet formulation of combination amlodipine-benazepril in healthy volunteers. Methods:This single-dose, 2 -sequence, 2 -period, open-label, crossover 10 study recruited healthy, adult, male volunteers with normotension. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences: a single-dose tablet containing amlodipine 5 mg plus benazepril 10 mg, followed by a single-dose capsule containing the same dose of each drug (AB), or vice versa (BA). The treatment period for each drug consisted of dosing and pharmacokinetic analysis on day 1, followed by pharmacokinetic analysis on days 2 to 7. Treatment periods were separated by a 4 -week washout period. For pharmacokinetic analysis, serial blood samples were obtained before dosing and at 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100 minutes and 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 12, 24, 36, 60, 84, 108, 132, and 156 hours after dosing. Tolerability was assessed using subject interview and spontaneous reporting. Results:Twelve healthy, male, Taiwanese subjects (mean [SD] age, 23. 510 [1. 7] years) participated in the study. No statistically significant differences inbioavailability were found between the 2 formulations based on the pharmacokinetic measurements of amlodipine and benazeprilat. The rate and extent of absorption of the tablets were found to be comparable to those of the capsules (90 % CI, between 80 % and 125 %). The mean (SD) relative bioavailabilities, as represented by AUC 0 −∞, of amlodipine and benazeprilat for tablets versus capsules were 1. 060 (0. 170) versus 0. 949 (0. 197), respectively. The mean plasma concentration-time profiles of amlodipine and benazeprilat were graphically similar. No adverse effects were observed with either formulation. Conclusions:The results of this bioavailability comparison study in this 10 population of healthy, male, Taiwanese volunteers suggest that the tablet and capsule formulations of combination amlodipine-benazepril are <b>bioequivalent.</b> Both <b>formulations</b> were well tolerated...|$|R
40|$|A rapid, {{sensitive}} and specific method for quantifying propylthiouracil in human plasma using methylthiouracil as the internal standard (IS) is described. The analyte and the IS were extracted from plasma by liquid–liquid extraction using an organic solvent (ethyl acetate). The extracts {{were analyzed by}} high performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC–MS/MS) in negative mode (ES−). Chromatography was performed using a Phenomenex Gemini C 18 5 μm analytical column (4. 6 mm × 150 mm i. d.) and a mobile phase consisting of methanol/water/acetonitrile (40 / 40 / 20, v/v/v) + 0. 1 % of formic acid. For propylthiouracil and I. S., the optimized parameters of the declustering potential, collision energy and collision exit potential were − 60 (V), − 26 (eV) and − 5 (V), respectively. The method had a chromatographic run time of 2. 5 min and a linear calibration curve over the range 20 – 5000 ng/mL. The limit of quantification was 20 ng/mL. The stability tests indicated no significant degradation. This HPLC–MS/MS procedure {{was used to assess}} the bioequivalence of two propylthiouracil 100 mg tablet formulations in healthy volunteers of both sexes in fasted and fed state. The geometric mean and 90 % confidence interval CI of Test/Reference percent ratios were, without and with food, respectively: 109. 28 % (103. 63 – 115. 25 %) and 115. 60 % (109. 03 – 122. 58 %) for Cmax, 103. 31 % (100. 74 – 105. 96 %) and 103. 40 % (101. 03 – 105. 84) for AUClast. Conclusion: This method offers advantages over those previously reported, in terms of both a simple liquid–liquid extraction without clean-up procedures, as well as a faster run time (2. 5 min). The LOQ of 20 ng/mL is well suited for pharmacokinetic studies. The assay performance results indicate that the method is precise and accurate enough for the routine determination of the propylthiouracil in human plasma. The test formulation with and without food was <b>bioequivalent</b> to reference <b>formulation.</b> Food administration increased the Tmax and decreased the bioavailability (Cmax and AUC) ...|$|R
