The break of gauge at Hamley Bridge was very cramped and poorly sited due to rivers, <b>bridges,</b> <b>gradients</b> and curves, which were difficult to improve upon. There were also shunting delays and a shortage of trucks.

50|$|Robertson had timed {{the train}} with his pocket watch, {{and to give}} the railway {{the benefit of the}} doubt he had rounded up to the nearest 5 seconds. The {{measured}} time through the girders (3149 ft) was normally 65 or 60 seconds, but twice it had been 50 seconds. When observing from the shore, he had measured 80 seconds for trains travelling through the girders, but not on any train he had travelled on. North-bound local trains were often held up to avoid delaying expresses, and then made up time while travelling over the <b>bridge.</b> The <b>gradient</b> onto the <b>bridge</b> at the northern end prevented similar high speeds on south-bound locals. Robertson said that the movement he observed was hard to quantify, although the lateral movement, which was probably one or two inches (25 to 50 mm), was definitely due to the bridge, not the train, and the effect was more marked at high speed.|$|R

Relative to the landslide near Aso <b>Bridge,</b> the slope <b>gradient</b> of the landslide near Volcanological Laboratory is more gentle. Therefore, the sliding velocity of this landslide was smaller, as well as the run-out distance.

40|$|The {{biological}} materials nacre and wood are renowned for their impressive combination of toughness and strength. The key mechanisms of these highly complex structures are crack deflection at weak interfaces, crack <b>bridging,</b> functional <b>gradients</b> and reinforcing elements. These principles {{were applied to}} a more fracture-tolerant model material which combined porous stiff ceramic layers, manufactured by freeze casting, infiltrated and bonded by a polymer phase reinforced with fabric layers. In the hybrid composites, crack deflection occurred at the ceramic–fabric interface and the intact fabric layers served as crack-bridging elements. Fabric-reinforced epoxy layers stabilized the fracture behaviour and delayed catastrophic failure of the material. The influence of the different components was analysed by varying the ceramic, fabric and interface properties. More ductile fabrics lead to larger strain to failure and more crack bridging but reduced the composite strength and stiffness after initial cracking. Higher elastic mismatch between the components improved crack deflection and bridging but resulted in deterred load transfer and a lower strength. The stiffness and strength of the ceramic layers influenced the elastic properties of the laminar composite and the initial crack resistance. Flaw tolerance was increased with polymer infiltration. We show with our hybrid ceramic–fabric composite as a bio-inspired concept study how fracture toughness, work of fracture and tolerance for cracking can be tailored when the contributing factors, i. e. the ceramic, the fabric and their interface, are modified...|$|R
40|$|Several NASA {{programs}} designed to monitor the Earth's atmosphere from space utilize infrared detectors which operate at or below 4. 2 K for optimum performance. At present, the detectors are maintained at cryogenic temperatures by a stored volume of liquid helium. These detectors must be electrically linked to amplification electronics data storage instruments maintained at 80 K. The electrical connections over the temperature gradient account for approximately 20 % of the total heat load on the Dewar for some systems, accelerating the boil-off of liquid helium cryogen and reducing the operational lifetime of the space-borne instruments.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2004 In an {{exploration}} of improving the intrinsic first order hyperpolarizability of organic NLO chromophores, sets of novel chromophores were synthesized. These compounds were designed according to a novel <b>gradient</b> <b>bridge</b> concept. Among these novel compounds, the first experimental example of a thiazole "forward" containing chromophore was synthesized. The first order hyperpolarizabilities of these compounds were examined using hyper-Raleigh scattering (HRS) technique. Results obtained at 1. 3 mum and 880 nm revealed that the regiochemical orientation of the thiazole has a marked effect on the hyperpolarizability. Thiazole "forward" showed a 20 % improvement in hyperpolarizability relative to chloroform {{compared to that of}} thiazole "backward. " An additional examination of two of these compounds with respect to their bulk nonlinear optical activity showed that the novel thiazole "forward" containing chromophore possessed an inherit instability in its structure compared to that of its thiophene analogue. The degradation of the thiazole "forward" chromophore occurred through a [4 + 2] cycloaddition reaction with DMSO. Recommendations to improve the stability of future thiazole "forward" chromophores were discussed. Overall, the first order hyperpolarizability of thiazole containing chromophores can be tailored, but are not stronger than their thiophene analogue...|$|R
30|$|To {{overcome}} all this, {{there is}} one major factor which can help eliminate the mass transfer limitations i.e. stirrer speed. The stirrer speed helps to maintain the intra-particle flow by maintaining total flow rate {{and to the extent}} that no shear effect exerts on cells performance as the cells can suffer internal damage during higher stirrer speed that could be attributed to a weaker cell membrane. The poor velocity also can create problems of the concentration <b>gradient,</b> <b>bridging,</b> and channeling, especially when using alginate beads. The ideal flow pattern in any reactor is not always possible, but we can improve and avoid these problems by recognizing optimum factors. The optimized stirrer speed or efficient mixing in a bioreactor has importance in immobilized cell system as it ensures optimal temperature and concentration gradients at the catalyst surface and all heterogeneous catalysis depend on these transport processes since it helps in elimination of CO 2 and ethanol (Armando Gamarra et al. 1986). The results can be supported by Converti et al. 1985 work where they studied the effect of stirrer speed on metabolic activities of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and found that stirrer speed is a major factor that affects the product yield (Converti et al. 1985).|$|R
50|$|By 1901, the town's {{population}} had reached 5,102, and by 1931 had doubled to 10,104. The early 20th century saw {{a period of}} increased urbanization of the area. The land immediately back from Hamilton Terrace, bounded by Robert St, Priory Road and Great North Road was now completely built upon. During World War I, the town welcomed many Belgian refugees from Ostend, {{many of whom had}} known the area through landing fish. They bolstered the fishing fleet, depleted by war service, and later erected a memorial in gratitude. In the period from the First World War to 1937, 312 council houses were built in a variety of locations, including estates at Hakinville, Prioryville, Glebelands and Prescelly Place. In 1926 the Urban District Council completed work on an electricity plant, thereby completing the electrification of the town, at a cost of £70,000. A sewerage plant followed in 1930, the Prescelly Waterworks in 1932, and in the same year the original toll bridge linking Milford and Hakin was replaced with Victoria <b>Bridge.</b> The steep <b>gradient</b> of the Rath was at this time constructed, and in 1939 a Town Hall was opened on Hamilton Terrace, at that time possessing an inbuilt fire station. 1939 also saw the opening of an outdoor swimming pool on the Rath. During the Second World War Milford Haven was chosen as a base for allied American troops, and roughly 1,000 American military personnel were housed in the town at this time. They manned an amphibious base which included a hospital built in Hakin and a docks complex at Newton Noyes. The base had a complement of 71 officers and 902 enlisted men, and played a role in preparations for D-Day. Milford escaped serious damage from German bombings during the Second World War. Despite its strategic importance as the home of a large fish market, a mines depot, a flax factory, and housing numerous military personnel, a co-ordinated attack on the town never materialised. In the summer of 1941 a bomb fell in fields near Priory Road, and later that year, a bomb damaged a house in Brooke Avenue. In neither instance were there casualties.|$|R
40|$|At oxic-anoxic interfaces, {{competing}} biotic and abiotic reactions {{drive the}} rapid turnover of elements involved in biogeochemical cycles. As {{a result of}} the complexity of interactions between biological and chemical processes, the contribution of microorganisms to biogeochemical element cycling is still poorly constrained. Understanding the role of microorganisms at oxic-anoxic interfaces is important because they link the carbon cycle to other element cycles via carbon fixation and degradation using inorganic electron donors and acceptors, respectively. The aim of this thesis was to elucidate the microbial impact on the cycling of two of these elements a Fe and S a at oxic-anoxic interfaces. In combination with conventional analytical techniques in biogeochemistry, state-of-the-art single-cell instruments were used to investigate biogeochemical cycling on the level of single microbial cells, enabling novel insights into extremely rapid, even cryptic, microbial processes with transient intermediates. This approach was first applied to laboratory cultures to investigate sulfur metabolism in large, colorless sulfur bacteria under controlled laboratory conditions. Confocal Raman spectroscopy of living Beggiatoa sp. cells revealed that the chemical nature of stored zero valent sulfur reflects the physiological state of the bacteria. Zero-valent sulfur was present in the form of both cyclooctasulfur rings (S 8) and inorganic polysulfide chains (Sx 2 -), the latter appearing to serve as intermediates during both the accumulation and the breakdown of sulfur storage globules. In the environment, the factors controlling the speciation of iron and sulfur were investigated in Lake Cadagno, a stratified lake in Switzerland. Despite low, 1 - 2 I molA l- 1 iron concentrations, significant rates of microbially-driven iron turnover were measured within the chemocline. The oxidation of iron by anoxygenic phototrophic bacteria could potentially contribute to up to 10 % of primary production in this anoxic zone. The coupling of iron oxidation to iron reduction by heterotrophic bacteria generated a closed, a cryptica iron cycle. These results suggest that rapid microbial redox cycling of iron may thus far have been overlooked in shallow, low-iron redoxclines which are globally widespread. Although sulfur cycling in Lake Cadagno has already been extensively studied, our high resolution time profiles combined with single-cell analyses revealed surprising insights into the metabolism of the sulfide oxidizing bacteria there. Anoxygenic phototrophic purple sulfur bacteria were actually highly active in the dark and respired sulfur aerobically under both light and dark conditions. To <b>bridge</b> spatially separated <b>gradients</b> of electron donors and acceptors, these bacteria utilized a novel mechanism of storage and transport that is not yet fully understood. Because we could not completely close the sulfur budget in the Lake Cadagno chemocline, the existence of yet-unknown sulfide oxidation mechanisms could not be excluded, presenting exciting possibilities for future research. In the course of these studies, the challenge of linking microbial identity with function using non-fluorescent-based, single-cell instruments {{led to the development of}} a new method (silver-DISH) for the targeted identification of environmental bacteria with nanometer secondary ion mass spectrometry (nanoSIMS), scanning electron microscopy energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM-EDS), and confocal Raman spectroscopy. This technique may be extremely useful for future environmental microbiology studies, especially for correlative imaging. Microorganisms evidently play an important role in biogeochemical cycling at oxic-anoxic interfaces in spite of competition with spontaneous chemical reactions. Overall, the results presented in this thesis may help to constrain and quantify the impact of microbes on carbon fixation and degradation processes in such environments...|$|R
40|$|Silo or Bin is used very {{widely in}} Mining, Processing, Pharmaceutical, Cement, Ceramics and Packaging industries. The {{purpose of the}} silo is to hold {{material}} until it is ready to use in subsequent processes such as processing, chemical, physical or transport. According to the Oxford Dictionary (DK illustrated), a Silo is a pit or airtight structure in which green crops are kept for fodder {{or it can be}} a pit or a tower for the storage of grains,cement etc, or it is an underground storage chamber for guided missiles. The capacity of a silo may vary from Kgs. to Tons. In this research, a silo is used as a conical shaped container with an orifice through which mineral sands of varying sizes were allowed to pass and their flow behavior were examined with respect to their material physical properties and silo parameters. In the first stage of the project, the flow behavior was studied using beach mineral sands with glass funnels with orifice diameters 3. 5, 4. 8 and 8. 0 mm and heights 8, 10 and 24 cm respectively to simulate silos of varying orifice. The capillary part of the funnels were cut uniformly at the neck regions to prepare them for the tests. It was decided to use naturally occurring geo-materials of different mineralogical, chemical, and physical characteristics for the investigation. For this purpose, samples of beach sand from several locations along the western coast of Sri Lanka were collected and sampled using the sampler riffler, thereafter sieved through 2 mm sieve to remove sea shells and other extraneous impurities followed by spiral separation and tabling. Subsequently, magnetic separation and high tension separation were carried out to separate magnetic and non magnetic fractions according to the standard procedure. The fractions separated consisted of ilmenite, rutile, garnet and zircon. A sample of silica was also obtained from the glass sand deposit at Naththandiya. Each sand sample was sifted using the standard test sieves. Before conducting the flow properties of these minerals they were dried at 110 °C for 2 hours and the test was conducted 3 times and the average flow rate obtained thus was plotted against the particle size and the diD ratio for each material. Where, d = average particle size diameter and, D = funnel orifice diameter. Interpretation of flow rate measurements and analysis of data indicate that all beach mineral sands used in the study had the same flow rate pattern. The mass flow rate vs diD curves consisted of three significant zones representing <b>bridging</b> effect, constant <b>gradient</b> zone with a negative gradient and the no-flow zone, which spilled over to the fine particle fractions. The effects of charge particle nature, moisture contained, repose angle, surface morphology of mineral and the orifice diameter of the funnel on the flow properties were also investigated. As the particles studied were naturally occurring, they were sub-angular having rounded edges. Another series of experiments were conducted using spherically shaped silica gel particles having diameters 1. 2, 2. 2, and 3. 3 mm respectively. In the second stage, a pilot plant {{in the form of a}} conical silo was fabricated in the workshop and the experiments were conducted using mineral samples each sample weighed approximately 3 to 6 kg. The samples for the second stage was obtained from two sources, Lanka Mineral Sands Ltd and the river sand pits at lngiriya. After a tedious process of size separation mostly involving sorting of particles of different size fractions by hand picking and sieving. The results obtained agree very closely with those obtained using the glass funnels. It is evident that there are three zones in the performance curve -flow rate vs particle size with the bridging effect region corresponding to diD ratios of 1 / 4 to 115 for relatively larger size particles and the region exhibiting the 'floc effect' resulting from residual charges in the fine sizes and air trapped within the floes. The mineral particles used were pre-dried (dried at 110 °C for two hours). However, the presence of moisture in the powder seems to have a significant contribution on the flow rate. - The importance of the performance curve and its characteristic features have been discussed and also the relevance of the performance curve in designing silos...|$|R
