5|$|Despite these {{problems}} England were largely the <b>better</b> <b>team,</b> with Cowdrey’s leadership, Geoffrey Boycott’s batting and a weakened West Indian attack being {{the difference between}} the sides.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool manager Bill Shankly {{was delighted}} with his team's victory and hailed {{it as his}} {{greatest}} moment in management. His Leeds counterpart, Don Revie, conceded Liverpool had been the <b>better</b> <b>team,</b> but was determined to make amends the following season. The national media was critical of the final, labelling it 'boring'.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{being the}} <b>better</b> <b>team</b> for the {{majority}} of the match, Liverpool were unable to beat the Independiente defence, with their shooting in front of goal being the culprit. Both sides questioned some of the referee's decisions. Liverpool believed they should have had two penalties, while Independiente felt that the assistant referee's decisions were questionable. Incidentally, the referee had served half of his two match ban handed out by the Brazilian Football Association.|$|E

5|$|England {{were largely}} the <b>better</b> <b>team</b> and, {{if not for}} the {{resilient}} batting of Chanderpaul, they would have won by an even larger margin. The West Indies suffered greatly from his absence in the second Test, losing the match by an innings and 283 runs, their biggest defeat in Test history. England retained the Wisden trophy at Old Trafford by taking an unbeatable 2–0 lead, They ultimately won the series 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Cardiff City {{began their}} {{campaign}} for the 1926–27 FA Cup with a home game at Ninian Park in front of around 30,000 fans against Aston Villa. After a goalless first half, Cardiff scored twice via a header by Len Davies and a shot by Ernie Curtis. Aston Villa attempted to save the match, but were unable to score until goalkeeper Tom Farquharson scored an own goal after turning in a shot by Villa forward Arthur Dorrell. In the fourth round, Cardiff played Darlington away. Newspaper reports {{indicated that they were}} the <b>better</b> <b>team,</b> but {{had it not been for}} the success of Darlington's defence then they would have won by greater than the two goal margin they achieved. Goals came from George McLachlan and Hughie Ferguson.|$|E
5|$|From 1946 {{until the}} 1980–81 season, the Vezina Trophy {{was awarded to}} the goaltender(s) of the National Hockey League (NHL) team {{allowing}} the fewest number of goals during the regular season. However, it was recognized that this system often meant the trophy went to the goaltender of the <b>better</b> <b>team</b> rather than the individual and was changed to offer the trophy to the most outstanding goaltender, as voted by the NHL General Managers. The William M. Jennings Trophy was created as a replacement and is awarded to the starting goaltender(s) playing for {{the team with the}} fewest goals against.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{competition}} reorganization {{there were no}} teams promoted from a lower tier. The Second League was created by combining 10 less fortunate teams that previously played in the First League with 8 <b>better</b> <b>teams</b> that previously played in the Transition League. The other 10 less fortunate teams of the last season Transition League were moved to the newly established lower tier also named Transition League where they will compete with <b>better</b> amateur <b>teams.</b>|$|R
50|$|The 49ers, the AAFC's second-best team, {{struggled}} in 1950 and finished 3-9. However, starting {{the next year}} they {{emerged as one of}} the <b>better</b> <b>teams</b> in the NFL's Western Conference, reaching the postseason in 1957 after some near-misses.|$|R
5|$|On 28 February, 20,000 spectators, a huge {{crowd for}} French rugby, {{turned out to}} watch the game against Wales. Although the Welsh {{went on to win}} 0–15, with three {{converted}} tries, they were prevented from scoring in the first half. They were clearly the <b>better</b> <b>team,</b> but the French played with greater passion. Once again, while Neumeyer praised the French forwards, he singled out Guillemin for criticism, creating an imbalance in the French scrum. The Chronique de la Jeunesse, however, highlights Guillemin's dribbling with the ball. Nevertheless, for the final international match of the season against Ireland, Guillemin was dropped from the team, with approval from Reichel, although he nevertheless travelled to Cork as a replacement.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Munch and Kellerman {{investigate}} a murder at Oriole Park at Camden Yards during a late-season baseball game, leaving 48,000 possible suspects. The Long Island man, presumably a Yankees fan, is found {{beaten to death}} on the stairs of the stadium, and the governor of Maryland pressures the police department to solve the murder before the game ends so that millions in tourism dollars and ticket revenues will not be jeopardized. After several fruitless interviews, Munch and Kellerman question Scott Russell (Brian Tarantina), a New Yorker who attended the game with the victim. Russell admits he killed the victim because he said the Baltimore Orioles were a <b>better</b> <b>team</b> than the Yankees. He agrees to confess to the murder if they let him watch {{the rest of the}} game. Back at the police department, Falsone continues questioning detectives about the Luther Mahoney shooting. Stivers expresses concern to Lewis that their covering for Kellerman's role in the shooting could bring both of them down if Falsone continues his questioning.|$|E
5|$|The Flyers {{hosted a}} {{practice}} {{game against the}} Muncie Tigers on September 26, 1920, but {{the result of the}} game is unknown. The Flyers' first game of the season was against the Rock Island Independents. The Independents beat the Flyers 45–0. As a result, the Staleys, who were supposed to play the Flyers the next week, cancelled because they wanted to play a <b>better</b> <b>team.</b> The Flyers tried to schedule game {{for the next few weeks}} but were unsuccessful. Since there were no rules to keep players on teams, several Flyers' players left and played for other teams. The Flyers scheduled a game against the Cleveland Tigers three weeks later, but the game was cancelled because the Tigers decided to play against the Panhandles instead. The same result happened next week against the Dayton Triangles. The Flyers were challenged by the Gas City Tigers and Muncie Offers More AC—two teams of Muncie. These games are not counted in the APFA standings.|$|E
50|$|Bees did {{finish a}} creditable third {{in his first}} season, but never really looked {{like one of the}} <b>better</b> <b>teams</b> in the league. From this point forwards, the Bees never looked like {{returning}} to the 'top table' of British Ice Hockey.|$|R
50|$|Betting {{before the}} Grand Final saw Woodville-West Torrens as clear favourites with 1/3 odds and Port at 25/10. Port's odds {{could have been}} even higher if not for their {{outstanding}} record in Grand Finals, and their reputation for beating <b>better</b> <b>teams.</b>|$|R
50|$|In the {{following}} decade, the ASA began {{to scare the}} opponents in the national scope, obtaining five successive victories in the Brazilian championship of 1979, being able to figure {{for the first time}} between the forty <b>better</b> <b>teams</b> of the country.|$|R
5|$|The {{high regard}} with which The Invincibles {{are held in}} the annals of Australian and world cricket is {{reflected}} in the various honours accorded to the players. Bradman, Lindwall and Miller were among the ten inaugural inductees into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996. Hassett, Morris and Harvey were later inducted, so that 20% of the inductees are from the 1948 team. Of these six, all except Hassett were selected in Australia's Team of the Century, with Bradman as captain and Miller his deputy. Bradman, Lindwall, Miller and Harvey are among a group of only 14 Australians in a total of 60 players who have been inducted into the International Cricket Council's Hall of Fame. In The Ten Greatest Test Teams by Tom Graveney with Norman Miller ten teams were compared by a computer and the 1948 Australians emerged second behind the 1984 West Indians. Graveney strongly disagreed with the result, writing 'there has not been a <b>better</b> <b>team</b> in my lifetime than Don Bradman's Australian tourists of 1948'. The computer regarded Sam Loxton {{as a member of the}} team as he played more Tests in the series than Neil Harvey, if Harvey had been picked the Australians would have been the superior team.|$|E
25|$|For the 1905–06 season, the Ottawa HC (aka Silver Seven) {{joined the}} new Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA). In February, Ottawa played a best-of-three {{challenge}} series against OHA champion Queen's University, but the Senators {{proved to be}} the <b>better</b> <b>team</b> as they swept the series with 16–7 and 12–7 victories.|$|E
25|$|Looking {{back over}} the series it is {{impossible}} to nominate any department of the game in which Australia were superior. For England to have lost this match and only drawn the series would have been a gross miscarriage of justice. Undoubtedly, they have been the <b>better</b> <b>team</b> throughout. Boycott established himself as a master batsman and John Snow stood head and shoulders over any bowler in the series.|$|E

50|$|He {{began his}} career in his {{hometown}} of Abadan, playing for clubs like 'Sepah Abadan' and Sanat Naft. His good play got him a transfer to one of Iranian football's <b>better</b> <b>teams,</b> Taj. There he could win the Hazfi Cup in 1977.|$|R
50|$|The men's {{team won}} the university's league (KUSA Handball League) in 2008, 2009,2010 and 2011. They {{are one of the}} <b>better</b> <b>teams</b> in the country having {{finished}} third in the Kenya Handball Federation national league for three seasons in a row from 2008-2010.|$|R
25|$|After being {{defeated}} by a heavy margin of 223 runs and an innings pasting, India {{still had a}} chance of winning the remaining two tests to avoid a series defeat, but that {{was too much to}} ask against the Invincibles, who were the <b>better</b> <b>team</b> in all respects. This test was the debut test of future Australian great, Neil Harvey.The toss was won by the Australians and on a pitch that was perfectly conductive for batting, Bradman chose to bat first.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, the Calgary Patricias {{were formed}} {{but they were}} never able to usurp the Calgary Regents as a <b>better</b> <b>team.</b> The Regents would win the Banff Winter Carnival tournament in 1919, 1920 and 1921. In addition, the Regents would go undefeated for four years. In 1924, the Regents would {{dissolve}} and form a new team with some members of the Calgary Byngs Ladies club. The newly formed team was known as the Calgary Holliles, and they actually lost their first game, a 2–0 defeat {{at the hands of the}} Calgary Patricias. The Hollies would win four Banff tournaments and be awarded the Alpine Cup.|$|E
25|$|He {{was named}} on the refereeing panel for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, and {{took charge of}} four matches during the pool stage of the competition. He also officiated the Quarter Final match between Ireland and Wales, the semi-final between Australia and New Zealand and the final between New Zealand and France, in the process {{becoming}} the youngest referee ever to officiate a final. Joubert was publicly criticised by French players Dimitri Yachvili, Dimitri Szarzewski and Maxime Mermoz for his performance in the final. Gerry Thornley, writing in The Irish Times, was {{of the opinion that}} France was the <b>better</b> <b>team</b> on the night, with Joubert being reluctant to award penalties against New Zealand {{in the last quarter of}} the match.|$|E
50|$|Svechnikov {{originally}} {{comes from}} Barnaul in Siberia, but {{his family has}} relocated twice to access <b>better</b> <b>teams</b> and coaching for their sons.

25|$|When {{the number}} of {{participating}} nations increased, the championship was split up in two groups from 2003 onwards, A and B, with the <b>better</b> <b>teams</b> in Group A. The winner of Group B will typically play {{a game against the}} least successful team of Group A to determine qualification for Group A for next year.|$|R
25|$|The {{selection}} {{of individuals to}} be assigned to specific teams bears on the resulting effectiveness of those teams. Aspects of team composition {{that should be considered}} during the team selection process include team members' knowledge, skills, and abilities (KSAs) as well their personalities and attitudes. To achieve high-quality results, teams built with members having higher skill levels {{are more likely to be}} effective than teams built around members having lesser skills; teams that include a members with a diversity of skills are also likely to show improved team performance. Additionally, higher levels of cognitive ability of team members has been shown to consistently correlate to increased work group effectiveness. Team members' personalities and attitudes have also been studied. For example, the personality factors agreeableness, conscientiousness, extraversion, and emotional stability are related to <b>better</b> <b>team</b> performance.|$|E
25|$|Despite their {{progress}} in the cups, Chelsea's Premier League form remained indifferent, with draws with Tottenham and Arsenal and a home loss to Newcastle effectively ended their chances of finishing in the top four of the League table. This meant {{that they would have}} to win the Champions League to secure qualification for the following season's competition. In the FA Cup final, Chelsea faced Liverpool. Chelsea were the <b>better</b> <b>team</b> for the first hour; Ramires put them ahead early in the match, and in the second half Didier Drogba doubled the lead. Despite Liverpool halving the deficit with an Andy Carroll strike, Chelsea held out to win their seventh FA Cup, largely thanks to heroics from goalkeeper Petr Čech, who pulled off the save of the season to narrowly deny Andy Carroll an equaliser; this was Chelsea's fourth success in the competition in six seasons and the best record of any club in the competition since Wanderers won it five times in seven years in the nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|Arsenal {{looked like}} the <b>better</b> <b>team</b> for most of extra time, {{creating}} lots of chances. Giroud hit the crossbar after five minutes and Ramsey fired a number of low shots at goal, forcing saves from McGregor. Four minutes into {{the second half of}} extra time, Arsenal took the lead via a low shot from Ramsey to the near corner following a back-heeled pass by Giroud. With four minutes of the game left, Hull had a chance to equalise when Sone Aluko took advantage of a Per Mertesacker slip, went round the onrushing Fabiański, and fired a shot across the Arsenal penalty area from a very tight angle, only for it to go inches wide. Three minutes later, Aluko had another chance when he shot at the corner only for it to be saved just in time by Fabiański. A minute later, Probert blew for full-time with the score at Arsenal 3–2 Hull City, giving Arsenal their first trophy in nine years since beating Manchester United on penalties in the 2005 FA Cup Final.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{sports teams}} in certain high schools within PPS / District 8 {{are moving to}} play within the WPIAL / District 7.

50|$|Because bowlers {{face the}} pins their {{teammates}} have left, the <b>better</b> <b>teams</b> {{are those who}} have a mix of bowlers that can “hit the left side”, “hit the right side”, or can “roll ringers”.
