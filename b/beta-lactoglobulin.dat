5000|$|The lipocalin {{family is}} a large and diverse family of {{proteins}} with functions as small hydrophobic molecule transporters. <b>Beta-lactoglobulin</b> is a typical member of the lipocalin family. <b>Beta-lactoglobulin</b> {{was found to have}} a role in the transport of hydrophobic ligands such as retinol or fatty acids. Its crystal structure were determined Qin, 1998 with different ligands and in ligand-free form as well. The crystal structures determined so far reveal that the typical lipocalin contains eight-stranded antiparallel-barrel arranged to form a conical central cavity in which the hydrophobic ligand is bound. The structure of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> reveals that the barrel-form structure with the central cavity of the protein has an [...] "entrance" [...] surrounded by five beta-loops with centers around 26, 35, 63, 87, and 111, which undergo a conformational change during the ligand binding and close the cavity.|$|E

40|$|The thiol {{groups of}} <b>beta-lactoglobulins</b> A and B have been cyanylated using [13 C]KCN. The samples of [cyanato- 13 C]-cyanylated-beta-lactoglobulins A and B which we {{prepared}} had signals at 109. 7 p. p. m. and 114. 4 p. p. m. We {{conclude that the}} thiocyanate carbon having a chemical shift of 109. 7 p. p. m. is in an apolar environment similar to a cyclohexane solvent, whereas the thiocyanate carbon having a chemical shift of 114. 4 p. p. m. is in a polar environment similar to water. The signals with chemical shifts of 109. 7 p. p. m. are assigned to the thiocyanate carbons of the native [cyanato- 13 C]cyanylated-beta-lactoglobulins A and B. We deduce that the signal at 114. 4 p. p. m. is due to an irreversibly denatured/unfolded species produced by alkaline denaturation, which is caused by intramolecular thiol/disulphide exchange occurring during our cyanylation procedure. We propose that Cys- 119 is cyanylated in the irreversibly denatured species and Cys- 121 is cyanylated in the native [cyanato- 13 C]cyanylated-beta-lactoglobulins A and B. We suggest that the same intramolecular thiol-disulphide exchange reactions occurred when McKenzie and co-workers [McKenzie, Ralston and Shaw (1972) Biochemistry 11, 4539 - 4547] alkylated <b>beta-lactoglobulins</b> with iodoacetamide. Therefore the one mol of thiol/mol of monomer in the native <b>beta-lactoglobulins</b> {{is due to the}} thiol of Cys- 121 and is not due to an equimolar mixture of Cys- 119 and Cys- 121 as they suggested...|$|R
40|$|A major canine endometrial {{secreted}} protein (cP 6, 23, 000 -M(r)) was purified by ion-exchange and gel-filtration chromatography and {{characterized by}} two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Anti-[human retinol-binding protein (hRBP) ] serum identified cP 6 on immunoblot analysis and immunoprecipitated cP 6 from culture medium. This major protein was also shown to bind [3 H]retinol. N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences were determined and compared with previously identified protein, RNA, or DNA sequences. N-terminal {{analysis revealed that}} cP 6 had high identity and similarity to serum retinol-binding proteins (RBPs), while internal sequence analysis showed a strong similarity to rat androgen-dependent epididymal protein and <b>beta-lactoglobulins.</b> Amino acid analysis, however, showed significant differences between these proteins and cP 6 in both total amino acid content and certain selected amino acids. Immunohistochemical analysis showed staining for RBP only in the uterine luminal epithelium. These studies suggest that bitch endometrium secretes a family of proteins (cP 6), some of which bind [3 H]retinol, are immunologically related to the RBP family, and have N-terminal and internal sequences with a high similarity to RBP, <b>beta-lactoglobulins</b> {{and other members of}} the lipocalin family. This family of proteins may be important in early development for supplying retinol or derivatives to the developing embryo...|$|R
40|$|The Maillard-reaction-induced lactosylation of {{the major}} whey proteins, alpha-lactalbumin (alpha-La) and <b>beta-lactoglobulins</b> (beta-Lg) A and B, {{occurring}} upon heating at 70, 80 and 90 degrees C for 1 to 5 h {{in the presence of}} lactose excess, was studied by HPLC coupled to electrospray ionization single and tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS, MS/MS). The presence of significant amounts of mono and bi-lactosylated forms of the three proteins and their increase with heating temperature and time were assessed from MS data. Evidences for a concomitant, significant denaturation, involving partial tertiary structure unfolding, were also obtained in the case of <b>beta-lactoglobulins.</b> A subsequent ESI-MS and MS/MS investigation on the tryptic digests of heated protein solutions exhibiting high percentages of mono and bi-lactosylated forms provided information on lactosylation sites. In particular, the latter were identified both on tryptic and on aspecific peptides, whose unusual relevance (compared to similar studies) was found to be due mainly to heat-induced protein degradation, occurring before protein digestion with trypsin. Among lactosylation sites identified only on tryptic peptides, i. e., those reasonably related to intact protein lactosylation, two lysines residues were found for alpha-La, both located in accessible regions of its tertiary structure. In the case of beta-Lg, besides three sites common to variants A and B (leucine 1, lysines 70, and 75), lysine 69 was found to be lactosylated only in variant B. Its proximity to a critical region of beta-Lg tertiary structure suggests that {{the difference between the two}} variants could be ascribed to a different evolution of their conformation upon heating...|$|R
50|$|The {{structure}} of alpha-lactalbumin {{is well known}} and is composed of 123 amino acids and 4 disulfide bridges. The molecular weight is 14178 Da, and the isoelectric point is between 4.2 and 4.5. One of the main structural differences with <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> {{is that it does}} not have any free thiol group that can serve as the starting-point for a covalent aggregation reaction. As a result, pure α-lactalbumin will not form gels upon denaturation and acidification.|$|E
50|$|Whey {{protein is}} the {{collection}} of globular proteins isolated from whey. The protein in cow's milk is 20% whey protein and 80% casein protein, whereas the protein in human milk is 60% whey and 40% casein. The protein fraction in whey constitutes approximately 10% of the total dry solids in whey. This protein is typically a mixture of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> (~65%), alpha-lactalbumin (~25%), bovine serum albumin (~8%)(see also serum albumin), and immunoglobulins. These are soluble in their native forms, independent of pH.|$|E
50|$|The overall {{shape of}} <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> is {{characteristic}} of the lipocalin family. In the absence of alpha-helices, the main diagonal almost disappears and the cross-diagonals representing the beta-sheets dominate the plot. Relatively low number of tertiary hydrogen bonds {{can be found in}} the plot, with three high-density regions, one of which is connected to a loop at the residues around 63, a second is connected to the loop around 87, and a third region which is connected to the regions 26 and 35. The fifth loop around 111 is represented only one tertiary hydrogen bond in the HB plot.|$|E
40|$|A new anion {{exchanger}} {{support has been}} designed for the selective adsorption of small proteins. This has been achieved activating an aminated support with glutaraldehyde and further coating the support surface with bovine serum albumin (BSA). In this support, " wells" are generated by two neighborhoods BSA molecules, {{on the bottom of}} those " wells" glutaraldehyde groups are exposed out ready to react with small molecules that have a size small enough to be accommodated between two BSA molecules on the pre-existing support. However, the BSA surface was not inert enough adsorbing many proteins, thereby reducing the selectivity of the system. A further solution was coating the immobilized BSA molecules with dextran, reducing the adsorption of protein on the BSA surface. This new matrix has been evaluated in the selective adsorption of the very small <b>beta-lactoglobulins</b> and alpha-lactalbumin from dairy whey, achieving the selective adsorption of both small proteins while other larger proteins from dairy whey remained in the supernatant. Moreover, a protein crude extract has been offered to the new matrix, and only small proteins could be adsorbed on the support (as probed by gel filtration). Thus this amino-glutaraldehyde-BSA-dextran-Sepharose is a matrix that may be used to selectively ionically adsorb proteins that were smaller than BSA (62. kDa). This strategy may be used for any other kind of adsorbing groups (chelating agents, boronic acid, etc.), or using proteins with different sizes to coat the support, designing tailor-made supports that may permit the fractioning of proteins following their sizes and by adsorption/desorption on different matrices. © 2010 Elsevier B.

50|$|Absorption of {{the amino}} acids and their {{derivatives}} into which dietary protein is degraded {{is done by}} the gastrointestinal tract. The absorption rates of individual amino acids are highly dependent on the protein source; for example, the digestibilities of many amino acids in humans, the difference between soy and milk proteins and between individual milk proteins, <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and casein. For milk proteins, about 50% of the ingested protein is absorbed between the stomach and the jejunum and 90% is absorbed by the time the digested food reaches the ileum. Biological value (BV) {{is a measure of the}} proportion of absorbed protein from a food which becomes incorporated into the proteins of the organism's body.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{three-dimensional}} structure, tertiary hydrogen bonds are formed (1) {{near to the}} entrance, directly involved in conformational rearrangement during ligand binding; and (2) {{at the bottom of}} the [...] "barrel".HB plots of the open and closed forms of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> are very similar, all unique motifs can be recognized in both forms. Difference in HB plots of open and ligand-bound form show few important individual changes in tertiary hydrogen bonding pattern. Especially, the formation of hydrogen bonds between Y20-E157 and S21-H161 in closed form might be crucial in conformational rearrangement. These hydrogen bonds lie {{at the bottom of the}} cavity, which suggests that the closure of the entrance of a lipocalin starts when a ligand reached the bottom of the cavity and broke hydrogen bonds R123-Y99, R123-T18, and V41-Q120. Lipocalins are known to have very low sequence similarity with high structural similarity. The only conserved regions are exactly the region around 20 and 160 with an unknown role.|$|E
5000|$|Eggs {{function}} as emulsifiers, foaming agents, and tenderizers in the dough. The egg white proteins, mainly Ovulblumins, “{{function as}} structure formers. Egg solids, chiefly the egg white solids {{combined with the}} moisture in the egg, are considered structure-forming materials that help significantly to produce proper volume, grain, and texture.” The egg yolk contributes proteins, fats, and emulsifiers to the dough. Emulsifying agents are essential to doughnut formation because they prevent the fat molecules from separating from the water molecules in the dough. The main emulsifier in egg yolk is called lecithin, which is a phospholipid. “The fatty acids are attracted to fats and oils (lipids) in food, while the phosphate group is attracted to water. It is this ability to attract both lipids and water that allow phospholipids such as lecithin to act as emulsifiers.” The proteins from both the egg yolk and the egg whites contribute {{to the structure of}} the dough through a process called coagulation. When heat is applied to the dough, the egg proteins will begin to unfold, or denature, and then form new bonds with one another, thus creating a gel-like network that can hold water and gas.Shortening is responsible for providing tenderness and aerating the dough. In terms of its molecular structure, “a typical shortening that appears solid room temperature contains 15-20% solids and, hence, 80-85% liquid oil…this small amount of solids can be made to hold all of the liquid in a matrix of very small, stable, needlelike crystals (beta-prime crystals).” This crystalline structure is considered highly stable due to how tightly its molecules are packed. The sugar used in baking is essentially sucrose, and besides imparting sweetness in the doughnut, sugar also functions in the color and tenderness of the final product. Sucrose is a simple carbohydrate whose structure is made up of a glucose molecule bound to a fructose molecule. Milk is utilized in the making of doughnuts, but in large scale bakeries, one form of milk used is nonfat dry milk solids. These solids are obtained by removing most of the water from skim milk with heat, and this heat additionally denatures the whey proteins and increases the absorption properties of the remaining proteins. The ability of the casein and whey proteins to absorb excess water is essential to prolonging the doughnut's freshness. The major whey protein in the nonfat milk solids is known as <b>beta-lactoglobulin,</b> and a crucial feature of its structure is that there exists a single sulfhydryl group that is protected by the alpha helix, and when heating of the milk solids occurs, these groups participate in disulfide exchanges with other molecules. This interchange prevents the renaturation of the whey proteins. [...] If the crosslinking of the sulfide groups does not occur, the whey proteins can rebond and weaken the gluten network.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Aggregation of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> occurs mainly via intermolecular {{disulphide}} bond exchange. Upon heating, <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> aggregated which increased with increasing pH.

40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: Atopy patch tests (APTs) {{allow the}} {{detection}} of delayed allergies at the skin level. The localization of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> delivered into the skin by an innovative ready-to-use APT (E-patch was investigated and the efficacy and safety of this device were assessed. METHODS: The E-patch containing <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was placed for 24 h in contact with hairless rat skin mounted in a Franz diffusion cell. Transdermal passage was monitored by measurement of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> A-[methyl-(14) C] or by two-site enzyme immunoassay. An iterative skin stripping allowed measurement of the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> penetrating the first external skin layers. RESULTS: After 24 h, 92 % of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> remained on the skin. The iterative skin strippings showed a 135 -fold higher concentration of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> in the stratum corneum than that found in the epidermis-dermis. Analysis of the solution in the receiver compartment by radioactivity assays or immunoassays indicates that intact protein did not cross the skin. CONCLUSIONS: The E-patch system allows native <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> to concentrate in the stratum corneum, {{in the vicinity of}} immunological cells, but does not lead to its systemic delivery. Therefore, it is suggested that this delivery system creates ideal conditions for promoting a positive topical response with reduced risk of systemic anaphylactic reactions caused by the native form of the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> A...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} {{the effect of}} copper on the heat-denaturation/aggregation of <b>beta-Lactoglobulin</b> AB at neutral pH. The kinetics of disappearance of native <b>beta-Lactoglobulin</b> under different ionic strength and Cu(2 +) /beta-Lactoglobulin molar ratio conditions were followed {{and the type of}} interactions (covalent or non-covalent) shared between non-native structures during the heating process were examined. On heating, the rate of disappearance of native <b>beta-Lactoglobulin</b> was accelerated by increasing the Cu(2 +) /beta-Lactoglobulin molar ratio. Copper induces oxidation of the free sulfhydryl group of <b>beta-Lactoglobulin</b> resulting mainly in the formation of covalent dimers, which were further associated into large non-covalent aggregates under high ionic strength conditions. Characterisation of the <b>beta-Lactoglobulin</b> dimers reveals the existence of three different molecular species arising randomly (dimers A-A, A-B and B-B), in which tertiary structure was completely lost. The quantity of added copper constitutes a powerful way to control the heat-denaturation/aggregation process of <b>beta-Lactoglobulin</b> in particular regarding the relative proportion of covalent and non-covalent interactions into formed aggregates...|$|E
40|$|A {{sensitive}} and specific enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) {{was developed for}} the quantification of cow's milk <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> in human serum. The assay had a sensitivity of 80 pg/ml (2 standard deviations from zero) and did not cross react significantly with any other tested milk proteins. The absorption of cow's milk <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> immunoglobulin G antibody levels after a milk load was investigated in eight healthy non-allergic individuals. There was a significant variation in the circulating <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> antigen levels during the six hour period after feeding (p < 0. 01) for the combined data. A biphasic absorption pattern was seen in all subjects except one subject who had undetectable levels. No significant variation with time was observed for the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> IgG antibody levels and no correlation {{was found between the}} <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> antigen levels and the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> IgG antibody levels. This pilot study offered information on the quantity of immunogenic cows' milk protein transferred to the blood after a milk load in non-allergic healthy adults and confirmed a biphasic profile of antigen transfer. The sensitivity of the assay used has shown that transfer of food antigen does occur in the majority of healthy nonallergic subjects...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} use of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> {{polymerized}} using microbial transglutaminase and heating to identify whether protein polymerization could reduce in vivo allergenicity and maintain in vitro and ex vivo immunoreactivity for use in tolerance-induction protocols. METHODS: Based on previous protocols applied in mice and children, we performed in vivo challenges (using a skin prick test) with native and polymerized <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> in adult patients with an IgE-mediated allergy to <b>beta-lactoglobulin.</b> In vitro humoral immunoreactivity was analyzed using immunoblotting. Cell-mediated immunoreactivity was analyzed using ex vivo challenges with native and polymerized <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and monitored by leukocyte adherence inhibition tests. RESULTS: The skin tests demonstrated {{that there was a}} significant reduction in immediate cutaneous reactivity after polymerization. Polymerization did not decrease the immunoblotting detection of s-IgE specific to <b>beta-lactoglobulin.</b> Cell-mediated immunoreactivity, as assessed by ex vivo challenges and leukocyte adherence inhibition tests, did not exhibit significant differences between leukocytes challenged with native versus polymerized <b>beta-lactoglobulin.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The polymerization of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> decreased in vivo allergenicity and did not decrease in vitro humoral or ex vivo cell-mediated immunoreactivity. Therefore, we conclude that inducing polymerization using transglutaminase represents a promising technique to produce suitable molecules for the purpose of designing oral/sublingual tolerance induction protocols for the treatment of allergies...|$|E

40|$|The {{morphology}} of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> structures inside droplets was studied during aggregation and gelation using confocal {{laser scanning}} microscopy (CISM) equipped with a temperature stage and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The results showed {{that there is a}} strong driving force for the protein to move to the interface between oil and water in the droplet, and the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> formed a dense shell around the droplet built up from the inside of the droplets. Less protein was found inside the droplets. The longer the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was allowed to aggregate prior to gel formation, the larger the part of the protein went to the interface, resulting in a thicker shell and very little material being left inside the droplets. The droplets were easily deformed because no network stabilizes them. When 0. 5 % emulsifier, polyglycerol polyresinoleat (PGPR), was added to the oil phase, the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was situated both inside the droplets and at the interface between the droplets and the oil phase; when 2 % PGPR was added, the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> structure was concentrated {{to the inside of the}} droplets. The possibility to use the different morphological structures of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> in droplets to control the diffusion rate through a <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> network was evaluated by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). The results show differences in the diffusion rate due to heterogeneities in the structure: the diffusion of a large water-soluble molecule, FITC-dextran, in a dense particulate gel was 1 / 4 of the diffusion rate in a more open particulate <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> gel in which the diffusion rate was similar to that in pure water...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of milk <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> phenotype {{on the content}} of fat, total protein, whey protein, casein, and fatty acids of 163 individual milk samples from Massese ewes was determined. Sampling was conducted randomly on five dairy ewe farms located in the area of origin of the Massese breed (North-West Tuscany, Italy). Three <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> phenotypes were detected: their frequencies were AA 20. 25 %, AB 63. 80 % and BB 15. 95 %, respectively. In agreement with previous studies, parameters of milk gross composition were not significantly related with milk <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> polymorphism. We demonstrate, for the first time, a significant relationship between <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> phenotypes and milk fatty acid composition in ewes. The study highlighted a co-dominant effect of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> alleles on the concentration of some milk fatty acids, particularly for trans fatty acid content, that was higher in milk from heterozygous sheep. Milk from AB sheep also contained lower amount of saturated fatty acids and medium-chain fatty acids, and higher levels of long chain fatty acids...|$|E
40|$|The {{genotypic}} frequencies at the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> locus {{were examined}} on 128 individual ovine milk samples from Massese breed.

40|$|The {{oxidation}} of {{fatty acids}} can be inhibited by engineering {{the surface of}} oil-in-water emulsion droplets to decrease interactions between aqueous phase prooxidants and lipids. The objective {{of this research was}} to evaluate whether emulsions stabilized by a multilayer emulsifier systems consisting of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and citrus or sugar beet pectin could produce fish oil-in-water emulsions that had good physical and oxidative stability. Sugar beet pectin was compared to citrus pectin because the sugar beet pectin contains the known antioxidant, ferulic acid. A primary Menhaden oil-in-water emulsion was prepared with <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> upon which the pectins were electrostatically deposited at pH 3. 5. Emulsions prepared with 1 % oil, 0. 05 % <b>beta-lactoglobulin,</b> and 0. 06 % pectins were physically stable for up to 16 days. As determined by monitoring lipid hydroperoxide and headspace propanal formation, emulsions prepared with the multilayer system of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and citrus pectin were more stable than emulsions stabilized with <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> alone. Emulsions prepared with the multilayer system of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and sugar beet pectin were less stable than emulsions stabilized with <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> alone despite the presence of ferulic acid in the sugar beet pectin. The lower oxidative stability of the emulsions with the sugar beet pectin could be due to its higher iron and copper concentrations which would produce oxidative stress that would overcome the antioxidant capacity of ferulic acid. These data suggest that the oxidative stability of oil-in-water emulsions containing omega- 3 fatty acids could be improved by the use of multilayer emulsion systems containing pectins with low metal concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Sensitive, specific, {{reproducible}} ELISAs {{were developed}} and validated for cow's milk <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and alpha-casein specific IgG and IgA antibodies and <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> antigen. A novel method for the quantitation of cow's milk <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and alpha-casein specific IgG sera standards was developed. This involved affinity purification and nephelometry. These assays {{were applied to}} a number of studies investigating the physiological and pathological levels of these antibodies and antigens in various body fluids from adults and infants. There was a large individual variation in the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and alpha-casein specific antibody levels and the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> antigen levels in sera, breast milk and saliva samples in both atopic and non-atopic individuals. <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> IgG antibody levels were higher than the alpha-casein IgG antibody levels in all of the sera samples assayed. Explanations are offered for these differences. A prospective study on 39 infants was performed to investigate the effect of parental atopy and of a maternal milk-free diet during late pregnancy and lactation, on the immune response to milk specific antigens and the allergy incidence in their infants. The presence of atopy had a significant influence on the allergy incidence of infants, with infants born to atopic parents having a significantly higher allergy incidence than infants born to non-atopic parents (p< 0. 001). Atopic mothers also showed a tendency to transfer higher quantities of antigenically intact <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> via the placenta and breast milk compared to non-atopic women, and in addition had a lower milk specific IgA antibody concentration in their breast milk. These factors could add to an underlying predisposition of allergy in infants, increasing the risk of allergy development later. The strict removal of all milk and milk products from the diet significantly reduced the circulating <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> IgG antibody levels after a period of 7 weeks (p< 0. 05). In "at risk" infants it was demonstrated that a strict maternal milk-free diet during late pregnancy and lactation significantly reduced the allergy incidence up to 18 months postpartum (p< 0. 0005). A significant increase in IgG antibodies against <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and alpha-casein was demonstrated in all infants on their first milk ingestion: this response was found to be higher in infants who developed allergy, but not significantly. The clinical implications of such a dietary regimen are discussed. In an adult study undertaken to examine allergic disorders, both <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and alpha-casein specific IgG 4 antibody levels were significantly higher (p< 0. 001) compared with IgGl, IgG 2 and IgG 3 subclasses. A significantly higher alpha-casein IgG 4 antibody level (p< 0. 05) was found in individuals suffering from food allergy compared with controls and atopy, not related to food. A positive correlation was found between the total IgE antibody levels and the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and alpha-casein specific IgG 4 antibody levels. In a study investigating absorption of antigens in normal adult subjects antigenically intact <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was absorbed across the gut wall in a biphasic pattern in 7 / 8 healthy adult subjects after a milk load. Levels of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> were found to peak at 30 - 90 mins and 165 - 240 mins with a significant increase in antigenically intact beta-lactogIobulin with time (p< 0. 01). The levels of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and alpha-casein specific IgG antibody levels were not influenced by the milk load. The significance of the transfer of milk antigens was discussed.

40|$|The {{intestinal}} {{absorption of}} ovalbumin and <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> {{was measured in}} Hooded Lister rats which had previously been made allergic to ovalbumin, and in unimmunized controls. The antigens were introduced both together and separately into closed intestinal loops. Absorption of free ovalbumin, but not <b>beta-lactoglobulin,</b> was reduced in rats with anti-ovalbumin antibody, demonstrating antigen-specific immune exclusion {{despite the presence of}} reaginic antibody. In contrast, the absorption of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was enhanced by the presence of ovalbumin in rats with IgE anti-ovalbumin, but not in unimmunized controls. These results suggest that macromolecular absorption may be increased in an antigen non-specific way in food allergy...|$|E
40|$|High {{expression}} and secretion of recombinant ovine <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> {{has been achieved}} in the yeast Kluyveromyces lactis. The yield of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> is 40 - 50 mg per litre of culture supernatant and accounts for approx. 72 % of the total secreted protein. Constitutive expression is {{under the control of}} the Saccharomyces cerevisiae phosphoglycerate kinase promoter from an intronless version of the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> gene. Secretion is specified by the ovine protein's own signal sequence. this system, coupled to an efficient and novel recovery protocol, allows 30 mg of pure protein to be isolated from a typical 1 litre culture. The protein is virtually indistinguishable from <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> conventionally purified from sheep milk by its behaviour in native PAGE and SDS/PAGE, reactivity to antibodies, CD, fluorescence spectroscopy and N-terminal sequencing. Attempts to achieve a similar {{expression and}} secretion system in the yeast S. cerevisiae met with only limited success, although it was found that heat-shock treatment modestly increased the yield up to approx. 3 - 4 mg per litre of culture supernatant. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that secretion in S. cerevisiae depended upon correct formation of the two disulphide bonds present in <b>beta-lactoglobulin...</b>|$|E
40|$|Heat-induced {{structural}} changes of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> were studied at temperatures ranging from 67. 5 to 82. 5 degrees C, and at pH 7. 5. These changes were monitored by measurement of surface hydrophobicity, thiol availability, and protein solubility. Kinetic studies {{were conducted to}} quantitatively describe the contribution of hydrophobic and SH/SS interchange reactions to the thermal {{structural changes}} of <b>beta-lactoglobulin.</b> Results indicate that <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> is sensitive to heat-induced interchange reactions with consequences for protein solubility. The extent of changes measured by the increase in surface hydrophobicity and the decrease in slow-reacting SH groups content could be described by a first-order fractional conversion model and were characterized by activation energy values of 233. 9 +/- 8. 6 and 148. 2 +/- 6. 7 kJ/mol, respectively. The break in the Arrhenius plot suggested in literature for <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> denaturation was confirmed in this study only for the kinetics of exposed SH groups. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The {{adsorption}} of <b>beta-lactoglobulin,</b> {{bovine serum}} albumin, alpha-lactalbumin, and beta-casein for 8 h and <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> and bovine serum albumin for 1 h at silanized silica surfaces of {{low and high}} hydrophobicity, followed by incubation in buffer and contact with Listeria monocytogenes, resulted in different numbers of cells adhered per unit of surface area. Adhesion to both surfaces was greatest when <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was present and was lowest when bovine serum albumin was present. Preadsorption of alpha-lactalbumin and beta-casein showed an intermediate effect on cell adhesion. Adsorption of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> for 1 h resulted in a generally lower number of cells adhered compared with the 8 -h adsorption time, while the opposite result was observed with respect to bovine serum albumin. The adhesion data were explainable {{in terms of the}} relative rates of arrival to the surface and postadsorptive conformational change among the proteins, in addition to the extent of surface coverage in each case...|$|E

This protein was immobilized on both amine- and acid-terminated thiol self-assembled monolayers, and the influence on its affinity to a specific IgG was investigated. For amine-terminated layers, the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was immobilized via its surface acid functions implying an activation step with 1 -ethyl- 3 -[3 -dimethylaminopropyl]carbodiimide hydrochloride/ester of N-hydroxysuccinimide (EDC-NHS). Conversely, the grafting on acid-terminated layer takes advantage of the accessible amine groups that react with the activated acidalkylthiols. The resulting layers of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> were then submitted to various concentrations of rabbit serum containing <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> specific rabbit immunoglobulin (rIgG), and the antigen/antibody affinity was evaluated using modulated polarization-infrared absorption spectroscopy (PM-IRRAS) and Fourier transform surface plasmon resonance (FT-SPR). Even though for similar concentration, the amount of adsorbed <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was identical on both surfaces, atomic force microscopy (AFM) images showed a better dispersion for amine-terminated layers. Moreover, the affinity to specific IgG, estimated under static conditions by PM-IRRAS and under dynamic conditions by SPR, was different. Grafting <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> via its acid groups gave an affinity constant 3 times higher than its immobilization via its amine groups {{despite the fact that the}} amount of accessible recognition sites appeared to be similar for both systems. This work underlines the importance of the involved chemical groups upon protein immobilization on their biological activity and will be essential for the construction of nondirect biosensors for detecting specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) of allergens...|$|E
40|$|Preruminant calves given {{a series}} of feeds of heated soya bean flour (HSF) {{frequently}} develop gastrointestinal hypersensitivity to soya bean antigens. The permeability of the intestinal mucosa of calves undergoing hypersensitivity reactions to ingested HSF has been assessed by feeding them milk and quantitating the leakage of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> into the blood. Maternal <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> did not evoke an antibody response in calves. Therefore its detection in the serum was not influenced by immunological mechanisms that normally remove or exclude antigens from the circulation. In sensitized calves ingestion of HSF caused {{a dramatic increase in}} the permeability of the intestine to <b>beta-lactoglobulin.</b> The change was transitory and after 24 hr permeability had almost returned to normal. The mucosal barrier was not permanently damaged regardless of the number or the severity of the reactions experienced. Indomethacin was ineffective in counteracting permeability changes. A progressive increase in the sensitivity of the gut to soya bean antigens was accompanied by a rise in the titre of serum antibodies to soya bean proteins. Absorbed <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was present in the serum in its monomeric form only, and quickly disappeared from the circulation. In an enzyme immunoassay used to measure its concentration absorbed <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> was indistinguishable from the native protein. These results suggest that measurement of intestinal permeability to macromolecules might be useful in the diagnosis of certain forms of food allergy in man...|$|E
40|$|Background: Cow's milk allergy in {{pediatric}} {{patients is}} an unresolved issue. Among the proteins in milk, bovine whey <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> (Bos d 5) {{is the most}} commonly allergenic. Allergenicity to native cow's milk proteins in humans is a well-studied issue, but very {{little is known about}} the allergenicity of cross-linked proteins found in bioprocessed dairy products. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the allergenicity of polymerized bovine whey <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> in symptomatic children diagnosed with IgE-mediated Bos d 5 hypersensitivity. Methods: Side-by-side skin prick tests with native and polymerized bovine whey <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> were performed in 22 symptomatic children allergic to cow's milk with detectable specific IgE to Bos d 5 by CAP Systems Pharmacia. A matched control group tolerant to cow's milk and undetectable specific IgE to Bos d 5 was established for comparison. Wheal mean diameter was compared between the native and polymerized groups by paired t-tests. Results: The mean difference in wheal mean diameter observed between native versus polymerized bovine whey <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> in the paired skin prick test of the allergic group was 2. 27 mm (p = 0. 02; 95 % CI 0. 38 - 4. 16). Conclusions: The skin prick test showed a significant reduction in the allergenicity of polymerized compared with native bovine whey <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> in children with IgE-mediated Bos d 5 hypersensitivity...|$|E
40|$|Human pregnancy-associated endometrial alpha 2 -globulin (alpha 2 -PEG) is {{the major}} {{secretory}} protein product of the endometrium during embryo implantation and {{the first few weeks}} of pregnancy. It is a homologue of <b>beta-lactoglobulin,</b> a retinol binding protein, but unlike <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> it is not found in the mammary gland. The cloning and sequencing of 34 alpha 2 -PEG clones has revealed several minor variant forms indicative of alternatively spliced alpha 2 -PEG pre-mRNA. These minor forms have also been detected amongst uncloned cDNA after PCR amplification. Some of these mRNAs would give rise to forms of alpha 2 -PEG protein lacking internal sequences, whereas others affect the mRNA sequences on the 3 ' boundary of the presumed termination codon. Sequences within the cDNA clones are consistent with the existence of splice sites, and together with similarities found between alpha 2 -PEG cDNA and <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> gene sequences there is good evidence in support of an unusual scheme for the alternative splicing of alpha 2 -PEG pre-mRNA involving both alternative 5 ' splice sites and alternative 3 ' splice sites. This scheme suggests that the alpha 2 -PEG and <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> genes share a similar structure in at least two regions, and it is likely that <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> pre-mRNA would show a similar pattern of alternative splicing for one of these regions...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{electrostatic}} interactions and obstruction by the microstructure on probe diffusion were determined in positively charged hydrogels. Probe diffusion in fine-stranded gels and solutions of <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> at pH 3. 5 was determined using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and binding, which {{is widely used}} in biophysics. The microstructures of the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> gels were characterized using transmission electron microscopy. The effects of probe size and charge (negatively charged Na- 2 -fluorescein (376 Da) and weakly anionic 70 kDa FITC-dextran), probe concentration (50 to 200 ppm), and <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> concentration (9 % to 12 % w/w) on the diffusion properties and the electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged probes and the positively charged gels or solutions were evaluated. The {{results show that the}} diffusion of negatively charged Na- 2 -fluorescein is strongly influenced by electrostatic interactions in the positively charged <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> systems. A linear relationship between the pseudo-on binding rate constant and the <b>beta-lactoglobulin</b> concentration for three different probe concentrations was found. This validates an important assumption of existing biophysical FRAP and binding models, namely that the pseudo-on binding rate constant equals the product of the molecular binding rate constant and the concentration of the free binding sites. Indicators were established to clarify whether FRAP data should be analyzed using a binding-diffusion model or an obstruction-diffusion model...|$|E
