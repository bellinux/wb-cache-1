25|$|VSI crushers use a {{different}} approach involving a high speed rotor with wear resistant tips and a crushing chamber designed to 'throw' the rock against. The VSI crushers utilize velocity rather than surface force as the predominant force to break rock. In its natural state, rock has a jagged and uneven surface. Applying surface force (pressure) results in unpredictable and typically non-cubical resulting particles. Utilizing velocity rather than surface force allows the <b>breaking</b> <b>force</b> to be applied evenly both {{across the surface of}} the rock as well as through the mass of the rock. Rock, regardless of size, has natural fissures (faults) throughout its structure. As rock is 'thrown' by a VSI Rotor against a solid anvil, it fractures and breaks along these fissures. Final particle size can be controlled by 1) the velocity at which the rock is thrown against the anvil and 2) the distance between the end of the rotor and the impact point on the anvil. The product resulting from VSI Crushing is generally of a consistent cubical shape such as that required by modern SUPERPAVE highway asphalt applications. Using this method also allows materials with much higher abrasiveness to be crushed than is capable with an HSI and most other crushing methods.|$|E

In this case, generally the tip is functionalized with a ligand that binds to another molecule bound to the surface.

40|$|This article {{presents}} a detailed {{study on the}} influence of winegrape variety, skin hardness of fresh berries, and withering thermo-hygrometric conditions on the dehydration kinetics of the grape. Although some works focused on the changes in the weight loss rate during grape dehydration under different environment conditions for several varieties, the combined effect of the skin mechanical properties and the thermo-hygrometric conditions has not been previously considered. The skin <b>break</b> <b>force</b> was confirmed as the varietal marker. Furthermore, its role in the selection of the withering conditions was assessed. The fresh grape berries were classified into two groups (soft and hard) according to the skin <b>break</b> <b>force,</b> and four off-vine withering conditions were evaluated. The softer skins facilitated the dehydration process increasing the weight loss rate, but the increase was significant only at low temperatures. The increase in temperature and/or decrease in relative humidity was beneficial to the grape dehydration process. A weight loss of about 50 % after 12 days of withering was achieved at an air temperature of 28 °C and relative humidity of 40 %. Under the same dryer environmental conditions, a certain varietal effect on the dehydration kinetics was observed because a faster weight loss occurred for those grapes characterized by lower values of skin <b>break</b> <b>force.</b> These results suggest that the grape dehydration rate, influencing the quality of dessert wines, should be planned considering the skin hardness of fresh berries and the withering conditions.

The <b>breaking</b> <b>forces</b> and elongations at break were determined by the standardized method (SRPS 2062) and fabric (tape method) according to SRPS EN ISO 13934 - 1. Fabric samples used for seam testing were sewed by seam (1. 01. 01) and stitch type 301 with stitch densities 3, 4 and 5 cm- 1. Optimal seam strength (130. 9 Ncm- 1) on the fabric T 71, {{and at the same time}} the highest strength, has been noticed at the samples with seam line in weft direction with stitch density 5 cm- 1, sewed with polyester thread 20 x 2 tex count, while on fabric T 71 that value is 115. 9 Ncm- 1.

However, {{there was a significant}} correlation between <b>breaking</b> <b>force</b> and kernel thickness; thicker kernels tended to have higher breaking forces. For all three cultivars, kernel−to−kernel <b>breaking</b> <b>force</b> distributions tended to be bimodal: one dominant peak existed around 30 N and a smaller peak around 15 N. The data showed that rice samples could have similar average kernel breaking forces, but their <b>breaking</b> <b>force</b> distributions were quite different. In turn, head rice yield was not related to the average <b>breaking</b> <b>force</b> of rice kernels in a sample; however, head rice yield was closely related to the percentage of “strong ” kernels, defined as kernels that sustained a 20 N force in bending.
