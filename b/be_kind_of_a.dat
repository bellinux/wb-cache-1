It was {{produced}} by the latter three under their stage name Rock Mafia. The song serves as the opening track of Can't Be Tamed (2010). In an interview with Sway Calloway for MTV News, Cyrus explained the lyrical inspiration of the song which is about female empowerment, saying: [...] "It's just about freeing yourself from anything you think is holding you back. And I think that's really important, especially for girls, {{because so many people}} are told, 'No, you can't do something,' or, 'You need to be this because Mom and Dad say that, teachers say this.'" [...] Upon the making of the song, Cyrus stated in the same interview that she tried to combine a serious topic with a lighter sound, explaining: [...] "I wrote it for women that feel like they're stuck in abusive relationships, but it's a dance song". She elaborated: [...] "So you think that must <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sad ballad, but it's a party song. ... It's about breaking free." ...|$|E
500|$|Tracer {{has been}} cited as being the [...] "poster girl" [...] for the game; the gaming {{magazine}} Hardcore Gamer concurred, describing her as [...] "Overwatch's single most iconic character". Many publications have referred to her as the game's mascot, or note that she essentially fills the role of one. Even prior to the game's official release, VentureBeat noted, [...] "if you've {{paid any attention to}} the early fan culture for Overwatch, you've likely noticed that Tracer seems especially popular". Kotakus Nathan Grayson described her as [...] "peppy and fun, but also courageous and badass," [...] adding that: [...] "In creating their own works involving Tracer, fans have turned those characteristics up to 11. Some depict her as childlike, naive and carefree. She can even <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> doof, a punchline." [...] Kotakus Kirk Hamilton asserted that she is [...] "easily the most iconic Overwatch hero," [...] in addition to calling her his favorite character. Tracer's popularity compared to the other characters has had unintended effects for Blizzard; Overwatch-related searches boosted by 817% on Pornhub after the game's open beta went live, with [...] "Overwatch Tracer" [...] being the top search term related to the game. Discontent with this fan-generated porn, Blizzard made efforts to have it removed. Kotaku noted that Japanese gamers received Overwatch positively, finding the characters of Tracer and Mei especially cute.s Japanese Fan Art Begin!|work=Kotaku|date=May 27, 2016|accessdate=May 28, 2016}} ...|$|E

2500|$|Lewis {{commented on}} the musical style of her debut album {{describing}} the album as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", with R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds. However, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends but can be performed acoustically. Lewis's second album, [...] "Echo", mixed pop and R during an interview with Variety magazine, she said on the album's sound that she [...] "wanted the album {{to have a little}} bit more of a live feel to it, with a little more live instrumentation." [...] In February 2011, talking about her third studio album [...] "Glassheart", Lewis said that the album would be more experimental than Spirit and Echo by embodying a [...] "different" [...] yet [...] "classic" [...] sound. She added, [...] "I'm really, really excited about it. I'm working with some new producers, some up and coming people and it's going to <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> different sound – but still classic". Lewis described it as [...] "energetic, deep, [...] unique". She also commented that it would have a darker tone and that she would be putting her [...] "heart into [...] lyrics".|$|E

Lewis later described the album as [...] "more progressive", [...] "more eclectic", [...] "more uptempo" [...] and [...] "a bit darker". The Sun reported that the album had taken a dubstep direction, with songwriters asked to submit dance songs and no ballads. The song [...] "Come Alive" [...] experiments with dubstep and drum and bass. Lewis stated that the song {{was inspired by the}} [...] "dirty and heavy" [...] music sound of British electronica band Faithless. She also commented, [...] "We wanted to do an uptempo song, but for it to remain true to what I do". In March 2012, after extending the album's recording sessions, Lewis elaborated on the evolution of her sound, [...] "I've got a track that's got a bit of drum 'n' bass at the end. It's quite different to what I've had out before." [...] Lewis then went on to add [...] "I've got a track that's very '90s. It's just different influences that I've had through my life growing up. I'm really actually looking forward to people hearing it." ...|$|E
