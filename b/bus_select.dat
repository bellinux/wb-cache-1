2500|$|On 6 April 2011 Mexican {{authorities}} found 59 {{bodies in}} eight clandestine mass graves in San Fernando, Tamaulipas. This discovery led officials {{to acknowledge that}} the Mexican drug cartels had begun to inflict fear through a new modus operandi: [...] "stopping buses and removing passengers, some never to be seen again." [...] Two weeks before the bodies were found, there were reports of buses being hijacked by the cartels near San Fernando, where cartel members would [...] "stop the <b>bus,</b> <b>select</b> passengers, take them hostage." [...] Fourteen cartel members were arrested too. By 8 April 2011, the secretary general of Tamaulipas, Morelos Jaime Canseco, confirmed the finding of 13 more bodies, increasing the body count to 72. When the death toll reached 72, bus lines in Tamaulipas refused to take people to San Fernando until the situation was resolved. Investigators began to mention that those killed were not migrants (like the previous massacre of the 72 migrants in 2010), but [...] "fellow Mexican citizens." ...|$|E

5000|$|In February 1980, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) started project 802 to {{standardize}} local area networks (LAN). The [...] "DIX-group" [...] with Gary Robinson (DEC), Phil Arst (Intel), and Bob Printis (Xerox) submitted the so-called [...] "Blue Book" [...] CSMA/CD specification {{as a candidate}} for the LAN specification. In addition to CSMA/CD, Token Ring (supported by IBM) and Token <b>Bus</b> (<b>selected</b> and henceforward supported by General Motors) were also considered as candidates for a LAN standard. Competing proposals and broad interest in the initiative led to strong disagreement over which technology {{to standardize}}. In December 1980, the group was split into three subgroups, and standardization proceeded separately for each proposal.|$|R
