It was found that neither teleoperator stiffness nor teleoperator damping influenced size discrimination. Also, teleoperator stiffness did not influ-ence stiffness discrimination. Furthermore, teleoperated performance was compared with direct interaction using bare hands or with the fingers in a <b>bracket.</b> <b>Size</b> discrimination performance was equivalent for these three conditions, but stiffness discrimination performance was lower for teleop-eration than for direct interaction.

40|$|As far as data on {{personal}} income are highly confidential and sensible, it {{is a common}} practice to collect such information by asking people to classify their own earnings along a discrete scale of income “brackets”. This procedure provides an unbiased estimation of average income, under fairly general conditions, but {{it is well known that}} standard error of estimates increases with brackets size. On the other hand, people tend to underreport income, and this bias is likely to increase as brackets width gets smaller. Thus, an optimal <b>bracket</b> <b>size</b> can be generally identified, that insures a reduction of underreporting without increasing estimate variance too much. The paper presents an evaluation of brackets size effect on various procedures for estimating Italian households’ income.

In total, 35 % of the phenotypic variance was due to genetic factors. The trait was measured on females only. Having smaller marker brackets flanking the QTL increased the genetic response from MAS selection. This was due to the greater ability to trace the QTL transmission {{from one generation to the}} next with the smaller flanking QTL-marker bracket, which increased the accuracy of estimation of the QTL allelic effects.

40|$|Earnings {{functions}} {{form the}} basis of numerous labour market analyses. Non-response (particularly among higher earners) may, however, lead to the exclusion of a significant proportion of South Africa’s earnings base. Earnings brackets have been built into surveys to maintain sufficient response rates, but also to capture information from those who are unsure about the earnings of fellow household members. This data type gives a rough indication of where the respondent lies in the income distribution, however exact figures are not available for estimation purposes. To overcome the mixed categorical and point nature of the dependent variable, researchers have traditionally applied midpoints to bracket earnings. Is this method too rudimentary? It is important to establish whether the brackets are too broad in South African Household surveys {{to be able to make}} reliable inferences. Here, midpoints are imputed to interval-coded responses alongside theoretical conditional means from the Pareto and lognormal distributions. The interval regression is implemented as a basis case, as it soundly incorporates point and bracket data in its likelihood function. Monte-Carlo simulation evidence suggests that interval regressions are least sensitive to <b>bracket</b> <b>size,</b> however midpoint imputation suffers distortions once brackets are too broad. Coefficient differences are investigated to distinguish similar from different results given the chosen remedy, and to establish whether midpoint imputations are credibly similar to applying interval regressions. To this end, testing procedures require adjustment, with due consideration of the heteroskedasticity introduced by Heckman 2 -step estimates. Bootstrapping enhances conclusions, which shows that coefficients are virtually invariant to the proposed methods. Given that the bracket structure of South African Household Surveys has remained largely unchanged, midpoints can be applied without introducing coefficient bias.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{laboratory}} study {{was to assess the}} potential cleaning efficacy of nine different toothbrushes around brackets in vitro. Standard and Mini Diamond brackets were fixed on coloured teeth in a special model, coated with white titanium oxide, brushed in a machine with different manual toothbrushes (three different types: planar, staged, and v-shaped bristle field), and tested with a horizontal motion for 1 minute. After brushing, the teeth were scanned and the black surfaces were planimetrically assessed using a grey scale. Tooth areas which were black again after brushing indicated tooth surface contact of the filaments. The remaining white tooth areas around the brackets indicated 'plaque-retentive' niches. Statistical analysis was carried out using the Kruskal-Wallis one-way test of variance for individual comparison. Bonferroni adjustment was used for multiple testing, and comparison of <b>bracket</b> <b>size</b> with Wilcoxon signed rank test. In the most critical area of 2 mm around the brackets, there was no statistically significant difference between the different toothbrushes evaluated. The untouched area ranged from 11 to 26 per cent of the initially whitened tooth surface. By pooling the toothbrushes according to their design, the median cleaning efficacy of the v-shaped (73. 1 per cent) and staged (75. 6 per cent) toothbrushes resulted in significantly superior cleaning efficacy than planar toothbrushes (60. 7 per cent) for standard brackets. For mini bracket type, staged toothbrushes showed a significantly better mean cleaning efficacy (77. 8 per cent) than planar (65 per cent) and v-shaped (72. 4 per cent) toothbrushes. Staged and v-shaped brush designs resulted in superior cleaning efficacy of teeth with fixed orthodontic attachments than toothbrushes with a planar bristle field.

30|$|Examining {{the results}} for the lingual brackets, it is {{interesting}} to note that the values of friction were particularly high for the self-ligating brackets In-Ovation L with respect to the conventional brackets (Bonferroni's post-hoc test, p < 0.05), with the lowest values being found for STb brackets. Although little has been published on the issue to date, the only other study[14] to test the friction generated at lingual brackets, by Ortan et al., found very different results, namely that less friction was generated with self-ligating (In-Ovation L and The Magic), as opposed to conventional (Generation 7 and STb) brackets, in all bracket/wire/angulation combinations tested. However, these differences could be due to differences in study design. Indeed, Ortan et al. tested a single bracket mounted on a block, without considering the premolar dentition or other adjacent brackets. Furthermore, the three types of steel archwires examined (0.016, 0.016 / 0.016, and 0.017 / 0.025) are normally used in the final, rather than the initial stages of treatment. What is more, they focused on a bracket from a posterior segment, where there are no major differences between lingual and labial orthodontic techniques[29]. Moreover, they did not take into consideration the inter-bracket distance, a crucial factor in the lingual technique. Indeed, the anterior segment is always shorter in the lingual arch than that in the labial[31], and the inter-bracket distance will therefore be affected by different <b>bracket</b> <b>sizes.</b> This is particularly important in the anterior region, where the distances between adjacent brackets are very small, and should be a focus of any investigation into friction in the early stages of lingual orthodontic treatment.|$|R

30|$|Torque {{expression}} {{is influenced by}} many factors, including the dimensions and material properties of the archwire and the bracket, the angle of twist of the archwire relative to the brackets, the mode of ligation, the bracket position, irregularities in tooth morphology, and beveling of archwires [3 – 8]. Slot size is another factor that could potentially influence torque expression. During slide mechanics, 0.022 -in. brackets outperform 0.018 -in. systems but are inferior in torque expression [9, 10]. With stainless steel archwires of 0.021  in. as the smaller dimension—close enough to the original 0.022 -in. <b>bracket</b> slot <b>size</b> to provide full engagement of the bracket slot—springiness and range in torsion are so limited that effective torque with the archwire is essentially impossible.

Although the levels of friction generated between labial brackets and archwires have been described, information on the frictional behavior of lingual brackets is still very limited[7 – 14]. Frictional resistance (FR) has been attributed to many factors, such as <b>bracket</b> type, wire <b>size</b> and alloy, method of ligation, contact angles, and slot size[3]. Kusy and Whitley provide us with a precise description effect of the critical angle on friction in both active and passive configurations, concluding that if the angle between the archwire and the bracket slot is less than the critical contact angle, only classic friction is influential, because binding[1, 15] and notching are non-existent in a passive configuration[16, 17].|$|R
30|$|The wires {{evaluated}} {{in this study}} are most usually inserted as the final archwires during orthodontic treatment, and heavier archwires are rarely used [8]. In both <b>bracket</b> slot <b>sizes,</b> the measured moments generated by rectangular archwires were higher compared to the square archwires, due to torque loss. The torsional play of a 0.018 [*]×[*] 0.025  in. archwire with nominal dimensions in 0.018 -in. systems could be theoretically estimated at approximately 0 ° and at 7 ° for a 0.019 [*]×[*] 0.025  in. archwire in the 0.022 -in. slot [13, 17, 28, 29]. However, various experimental configurations revealed that torque play is actually higher than calculated, both in conventional [30 – 34] and self-ligating bracket systems [35 – 39]. The inconsistency in torque play assessments between theoretical calculations and experimental configurations could be attributed to dimensional inconsistency of archwire and bracket, as well as to rounded wire edges [29, 32, 40, 41]. In addition, the bracket slot could be tapered slightly, resulting in further torque-loss fluctuations between archwires of different cross-sections [29]. As the OMSS configuration approximates the clinical situation, the torque loss is notably higher than in the in vitro activating experiments. This is due to additional torque play provided by the adjacent teeth [30], that is, the play both in the torque-receiving and in the torque-delivering bracket must be negated [42].|$|R

Methods: Four types of ceramic (one with a stainless steel slot) and one conventional stainless steel bracket were tested with two types of archwire sizes: a 0. 017 × 0. 025 -in wire in the 0. 018 -in slots and a 0. 019 × 0. 025 -in wire in the 0. 022 -in slot brackets. For pairwise comparisons between the 0. 018 -in and 0. 022 -in slot sizes in the same bracket, an independent sample t-test was used. One-way and two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Tukey’s post-hoc test at the 95 % confidence level (α = 0. 05) were also used for statistical analyses. Results: There were significant differences between the 0. 022 -in and 0. 018 -in slot sizes for the same brand of bracket.

The fluid was most likely methane, which forms several percent of Titan's atmosphere and can exist as a liquid at the surface. The morphology of the valley networks {{and the nature of}} Titan's surface environment are inconsistent with a primary valley formation process involving thermal, chemical, or seepage erosion. The valleys were more likely eroded mechanically by surface runoff associated with methane precipitation. If mechanical erosion did occur, the flows must first have been able to mobilize any sediment accumulated in the valleys. We develop a model that links precipitation, open-channel flow, and sediment transport to calculate the minimum precipitation rate required to mobilize sediment and initiate erosion. Using data from two monitored watersheds in the Alps, we show that the model is able to predict precipitation rates in small drainage basins on Earth. The calculated precipitation rate is most sensitive to the sediment grain size. For a grain diameter of 1 – 10 cm, a range that <b>brackets</b> the median <b>size</b> observed at the Huygens landing site, the minimum precipitation rate required to mobilize sediment in the nearby branching networks is 0. 5 – 15 mm hr^(− 1). We show that this range is reasonable given the abundance of methane in Titan's atmosphere. These minimum precipitation rates can be compared with observations of tropospheric cloud activity and estimates of long-term methane precipitation rates to further test the hypothesis that runoff eroded the valleys...|$|R
40|$|In {{orthodontic}} treatment, sliding {{is frequently}} used to cause tooth movement. Inherent to {{this technique is}} the generation of a counteracting frictional force. In this pilot study, a fretting test consisting of reciprocating tangential displacements was used to investigate test parameters influencing frictional forces during sliding processes. Tests were run at a normal load of 2 N and a frequency of 1 Hz for tangential displacement strokes of 200 microm. Stainless steel orthodontic wires with cross-sections of. 017 x. 025 in (W 17) and. 018 x. 025 in (W 18), and <b>brackets</b> with slot <b>sizes</b> of. 018 in (B 18) and. 022 in (B 22) were used. A specific centered positioning method was developed to achieve a parallel alignment of the wire and the bracket slot. The experimental results indicated the significant role of the centered positioning method on the friction value. Implementation of the centered positioning method resulted in a friction force ranging from 0. 89 N to 0. 97 N at a 200 microm displacement amplitude and 1 Hz frequency, corresponding to a coefficient of friction ranging from 0. 45 to 0. 49 for the B 18 -W 17 and the B 22 -W 17 bracket-wire combinations, respectively. When the centered positioning method was not used, significantly higher values for the coefficient of friction were found for both bracket-wire combinations. The slot-filling, bracket-wire combinations (B 18 -W 18 and B 22 -W 22) resulted in an increased coefficient of friction and therefore are not recommended as sliding systems. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The {{factors which}} may {{influence}} the bond strength of the applied orthodontic brackets on the tooth surface are the size {{and structure of the}} bracket base. Objective. The aim of the paper was to investigate the influence of size and shape of different types of brackets on bond strength on the enamel and analyze the remaining quality of adhesive material on the tooth surface after debonding of orthodontic brackets (adhesive remnant index - ARI). Methods. In this study, three types of metal <b>brackets</b> of different <b>sizes</b> and shapes of Dentaurum manufacturer were used (Utratrimm, Equilibrium 2, Discovery, Dentaurum, Inspringen, Germany). The brackets were applied onto the middle part of the anatomic crowns of buccal surfaces of 30 premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons. In addition, the pre-treatment of teeth by 37 % orthophosphoric acid and adhesive material System 1 + (Dentaurum, Germany) were used. Results. The mean value of the bonded brackets bond strength of Discovery type after debonding was 8. 67 ± 0. 32 MPa, while the value of the bonded brackets bond strength of Equilibrium 2 type amounted to 8. 62 ± 0. 22 MPa. The value of the bonded brackets bond strength of Ultratrimm type after debonding was 8. 22 ± 0. 49 MPa. There were no statistical differences in the values of bond strength regarding all three groups of the investigated orthodontic brackets (F= 4. 56; p< 0. 05). Conclusion. The base size and design of metal orthodontic brackets did not {{play a significant role in}} bond strength, while the values of ARI index were identical in all three investigated groups...|$|R
40|$|After {{publishing}} {{its first}} report in September 1997, the Own Funds Working Group, {{in agreement with}} the European Committee of Central Balance Sheet Offices, decided to continue its work in order {{to gain a better understanding}} of the differences in financing structures between countries. To this end, the Group decided firstly to broaden the review period from 1986 to 1996. The compilation of figures and ratios over a longer period is advantageous in a number of ways. It not only enables an assessment of trends in financing structures in each country, but also of any changes in the ranking of the different countries involved. Furthermore, it gives an insight into the influence of cyclical and structural factors on this ranking. The Group also set itself the objective of not only taking a closer look at the influence of institutional factors The study was based, as the previous study, on incorporated companies (partnerships and sole proprietorships are therefore excluded) of the manufacturing industry, which is uniformly defined across all the countries. Once again, five <b>size</b> <b>brackets</b> according to turnover expressed in euros are analyzed. The size-based approach is essential because the aggregate values conceal the diversity of the situations in the various countries, especially in Germany where the results are strongly influenced by large firms. The two statistical parameters used are the weighted mean and the median. Moreover, to gain a better understanding of the influence of financing needs, assets have been broken down into their main items. As previously, efforts have been made to align methodologies so that the analyses cover variables that are as homogenous as possible from country to country. corporate finance, capital structure, europe, financial systme, credit, bankrutcy...|$|R
