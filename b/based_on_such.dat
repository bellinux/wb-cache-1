5|$|A {{large number}} of strains {{belonging}} to this species have been isolated and characterised. In addition to serotype (vide supra), they can be classified according to their phylogeny, i.e. the inferred evolutionary history, as shown below where the species is divided into six groups. Particularly the use of whole genome sequences yields highly supported phylogenies. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> data, five subspecies of E. coli were distinguished.|$|E
5|$|The {{incidence}} of TBI varies by age, gender, region and other factors. Findings of incidence and prevalence in epidemiological studies vary <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> factors as which grades of severity are included, whether deaths are included, whether {{the study is}} restricted to hospitalized people, and the study's location. The annual {{incidence of}} mild TBI {{is difficult to determine}} but may be 100–600 people per 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Another {{aspect of}} the portraits on the Makkotai coins are {{that they do not}} have {{identical}} head sizes and some facial features also vary from one coin to another, even though they all have the same written legend. Such an observation has been made of coins assigned to the Western Kshatrapas of Gujarat, which are thought to be another inspiration for the Chera coins. Scholars who analyzed the varying portraiture on the Kshatrapa coins have advanced several theories to explain the phenomenon: that the coins could be of different kings who chose to keep the name of an ancestor on their coins or the coins all belong to one king with portraits depicting him at his different ages. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> theories, the Chera coins could either belong to a series of rulers or to a single king called Cheraman Makkotai.|$|E

5|$|Frogs and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern frogs, including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of frogs are still debated.|$|E
5|$|South American aetosaurs {{have been}} found from Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. In Argentina, they are known from the Carnian Ischigualasto Formation. Common genera from Ischigualasto include Aetosauroides and Stagonolepis. In Brazil, fossils {{have been found}} in the Santa Maria and Caturrita Formations in Rio Grande do Sul (Paleorrota). Chilean aetosaurs are {{represented}} by one genus, Chilenosuchus, from the Antofagasta Region. Aetosaurs have also been found from India, which, along with South America, was part of Gondwana during the Late Triassic. Early descriptions of aetosaurs included material from the Maleri Formation in south-central India, although it was too inadequate to assign specimens to any particular genus. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> descriptions, the Indian aetosaurs most closely resemble Longosuchus and Paratypothorax. Reports of aetosaurs from Madagascar are based on probable crocodylomorph scutes.|$|E
5|$|To further {{provide the}} fair and {{balanced}} view of the topic, script editor Karen Wilson furthered her research by consulting with a Muslim advisor throughout the scripting and filming stages, as well as consulting the Muslims who played extras in the episode. Although Wilson does not usually talk to cast members beforehand, {{it was the first}} time she became aware of the research and advice behind a storyline, and felt that the advice she was given was useful in staging the scenes. It was also based on real life instances, something that Brenton considered a hallmark of the series, as many episodes are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> events. News stories detailing similar instances to the plot came out sometime after the episode's broadcast, and the producers believed it justified the episode. The ending was written to be melancholic, in which there were no winners.|$|E

25|$|Saturn's Titan, meanwhile, has {{an outside}} chance of {{harbouring}} life, {{as it has}} retained a thick atmosphere and has liquid methane seas on its surface. Organic-chemical reactions that only require minimum energy are possible in these seas, but whether any living system can be <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> minimal reactions is unclear, and would seem unlikely.

25|$|Parasitism {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as part of the}} explanation of the evolution of secondary sex characteristics in breeding male animals, such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of male lions. The argument is that female hosts select males for breeding <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> characteristics because they act as honest signals of costly handicaps. A possible mechanism for this, suggested by Ivar Folstad and Andrew Karter, is that the male hormone testosterone encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics such as manes, but at the price of reducing an animal's immune defences.|$|E

25|$|The {{study of}} parole (which manifests through {{cultural}} discourses and dialects) is {{the domain of}} sociolinguistics, the sub-discipline that comprises the study of a complex system of linguistic facets within a certain speech community (governed by {{its own set of}} grammatical rules and laws). Discourse analysis further examines the structure of texts and conversations emerging out of a speech community's usage of language. This is done through the collection of linguistic data, or through the formal discipline of corpus linguistics, which takes naturally occurring texts and studies the variation of grammatical and other features <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> corpora (or corpus data).|$|E

25|$|The first {{virus that}} could be crystalized and whose {{structure}} could therefore be elucidated in detail was tobacco mosaic virus (TMV), the virus that had been studied earlier by Ivanovski and Beijerink. In 1935, Wendell Stanley achieved its crystallization for electron microscopy and showed that it remains active even after crystallization. Clear X-ray diffraction pictures of the crystallized virus were obtained by Bernal and Fankuchen in 1941. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>such</b> pictures, Rosalind Franklin proposed the full structure of the tobacco mosaic virus in 1955. Also in 1955, Heinz Fraenkel-Conrat and Robley Williams showed that purified TMV RNA and its capsid (coat) protein can self-assemble into functional virions, suggesting that this assembly mechanism is also used within the host cell, as Delbrück had proposed earlier.|$|E
