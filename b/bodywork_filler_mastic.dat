40|$|The dynamic shear {{rheometer}} (DSR) and the {{bending beam}} rheometer (BBR) {{were used to}} characterize the rheological properties of bitumen mixed with mineral filler that is smaller than 75 mu m in size. The study focuses on using a rheology-based model to assess the effect of two distinctly different fillers, quartz and calcite, on the engineering behavior of the bitumen-mineral <b>filler</b> <b>mastic.</b> Four conventionally different bitumens were selected to assess the filler effect. By mathematically modeling the rheological response, predicting the rheological behavior of mastics becomes simpler and more efficient in approach. The rheological properties of bitumen-mineral <b>filler</b> <b>mastics</b> are characterized using the time-temperature superposition principle after data obtained from DSR and BBR are converted to the same unit. The stiffening effects of the filler are relatively small at short loading times or low temperatures, but are larger at higher temperatures or long loading times. This stiffening effect {{is found to be}} bitumen dependent as well as filler dependent. The validity of a micromechanical model is confirmed in this study. The Nielsen model was selected since it employs rheological parameters that could explain the filler effect. The micromechanical model shows good agreement with testing data at the filler volume fraction up to 22 %...|$|R
40|$|This report {{studied the}} effect of crumb rubber in the asphalt mixture. The {{mixtures}} were also having limestone filler as a modifier. Mastic and mortar (mastic-fine aggregate system) mixture having different quantities of crumb rubber and limestone filler modifiers have been tested {{in order to find}} the best rutting resistance combination with an acceptable stiffness. The rheological tests on bituminous mastics and mortars have done in the laboratories in Nottingham Transport Engineering Centre (NTEC) and University of Bologna (DICAM). In the second chapter, an extensive literature review about the binders, additives, asphalt mixtures, various modelling and testing methods have been reviewed. In the third chapter, the physical and rheological properties of the binders have been investigated using both traditional devices and DSRs. The forth chapter is dedicated to finding the behaviour of the modified mastics (Binder-modifier system) with different combinations. Five different combinations of crumb rubber and limestone <b>filler</b> <b>mastic</b> tested with various methods using Dynamic Shear Rheometers. In the fifth chapter, in order to find {{the effect of}} the modifiers in the rheological properties of the complete asphalt mixture, the fine aggregates added to the same mastic combinations. In this phase, the behaviour of the system so-called mortar; binder, rubber, filler and fine aggregates) has been studied using the DSR device and the traditional tests. The results show that using fine crumb rubber reduces the thermo sensibility of the mastic (Binder Bitumen System) and improves its elasticity. Limestone filler in the other hand increases the mixture stiffness at high Frequencies. Another important outcome of this research was that the rheological properties of the mortars were following the same trend of the mastics, therefore study the rheological properties of the mastic gives an upright estimation of the mortar...|$|R
40|$|The {{properties}} of mastics are {{fundamental to the}} performance of many types of hot mix in current use. Whilst some fillers appear chemically inert in mastics, others are considered as chemically active. The way these different types of <b>filler</b> affect <b>mastics</b> and mixes was investigated. Limestone and hydrated lime fillers were incorporated into two binders- 100 penetration paving grade and an EVA polymer modified binder based on the same bitumen. The resultant mastics were assessed using several test procedures, on the bitumen, on the mastics and some on hot mix samples. The tests included rheology, Cantabro and net adsorption. The effect of short-term ageing of the binder was also investigated. The results showed the greatest effect was due to filler volume concentration whilst the short-term ageing caused substantially less change. With the materials studied, {{there was no evidence of}} significant hardening due to a chemical reaction between the active filler and the polymer modified binder...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this study, the {{stiffening}} {{effect of}} fillers on asphalt binders was characterized through micromechanics and rheology methods. The dynamic shear rheometer (DSR) {{was used to}} measure viscoelastic properties of asphalt mastic. Mechanical volume filling effects and additional interacting mechanisms within mastic systems are discussed on the basis of micromechanics-rheology model to predict the complex shear modulus of asphalt mastic from the measured mastic data. It is observed that the phase angle ranges from 88. 8 o to 89. 0 o, does not significantly change due to limestone fillers addition. The analytical model prediction of complex shear modulus based on the dynamic shear modulus can be used. Using the nonlinear regression, the Einstein coefficient KE is 4. 22, 5. 09 and 7. 44 for asphalt mixed with limestone, cement and hydrated lime, respectively. Beside, the SEM results explain why the mastic system with hydrated lime shows the highest KE. The behavior of hydrated lime <b>fillers</b> filled <b>mastics</b> is probably due to physico–chemical interaction, which can be validated by further research...|$|R
30|$|Modern VPM {{are often}} based on {{polyvinyl}} acetate (PVA) as a polymer binder due to its high damping loss factor, good thermoplastic properties, thermal stability, availability and non-toxicity in combination with carbon materials as inert and highly available dispersed <b>fillers.</b> Particularly, a <b>mastic</b> with high vibrodamping properties {{on the basis of}} PVA dispersion and graphite {{as one of the most}} efficient fillers was suggested in (2002). A possible approach to the further enhancement of vibrodamping performances for such composites is based on the improvement of the filler–binder compatibility due to a specific functionalization of the filler surface in order to strengthen its interaction with the polymer.|$|R
40|$|An {{investigation}} into the cause of premature failure of a premix asphalt layer on a road in South Africa identified the filler material in the mix as the main cause. The failure was characterised by signs of dryness {{and an increase in}} permeability within a few months of laying the asphalt; distress was evident even while the project was still in progress. Later phases of deterioration were stripping of binder from surface stone, pumping and crocodile cracking. The asphalt was within specification and no immediate cause was apparent. Specialised testing was conducted on the recovered binder, detailed filler grading, X-ray diffraction (XRD) tests, X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (XRF) tests and isotope dating. The ashing of the recovered binder indicated that a super fine filler material was present in the mix. It was determined that the origin of the super fine filler material was mostly tillite. The stiffening effect of the superfine filler material was quantified by the Rigden voids test, and by testing the <b>filler</b> binder <b>mastic.</b> Binder film thickness and mix stiffness calculations quantified the influence of the observed super-fine tillite filler size material in the asphalt mix, and were used to explain the mechanism of distress. ...|$|R

The use of industrial wastes and by-products as Mineral fillers in asphalt mixtures {{is not a new}} technique. Mineral Fillers have been used in road construction for many years. They are incorporated in asphalt mixtures to enhance the properties and performance of asphalt concrete pavements. Mineral fillers vary in mineralogy, chemical properties, shape and texture, size, and gradation. The major objective of this initial investigation was to find out whether it is possible to use the local industrial and by-products wastes such as Steel slag, Ceramic waste, Coal fly ash, limestone, and Rejected ceramic raw material as mineral <b>fillers</b> in Stone <b>Mastic</b> Asphalt (SMA) mixtures in Malaysia. Chemical analysis using Scanning Electro Microscope (SEM), Energy Dispersive X-ray (EDX) and physical tests were performed on those local industrial and by-products wastes specimens to determine its chemical composition, size and shape of particles, as well as gradation and specific gravity, and were compared to limestone dust the common type of mineral filler used in Stone Mastic Asphalt in Malaysia. The test results indicate that the physical and chemical properties of the local industrial wastes are within specified limits of quality requirements for mineral filler for Bituminous Paving Mixtures AASHTO M 17, and in accordance with AASHTO PP 41 (Designing of Stone Matrix Asphalt) and these waste materials can potentially be used as mineral <b>fillers</b> in Stone <b>Mastic</b> Asphalt (SMA) Mixtures...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the importance of}} studies on materials known as fillers from different mineral origins, used in asphalt mixes, specifically {{in the formulation of}} mastics. The research was carried out on samples of limestone and granite rock filler and asphalt binder (50 / 70). The samples were evaluated through semiquantitative chemical analyses by X-ray fluorescence, granulometry by low angle laser emission, scanning electron microscopy, softening point tests, penetration tests, and aggregate-asphalt binder and aggregate-mastic adhesion tests. The results highlighted convergent trends, indicating that the active behavior of the <b>fillers</b> in the <b>mastic</b> formulation is not related {{to the size of the}} particles, but rather to their form, surface texture, specific surface area and mineralogical nature, allowing the filler activity concept to be divided into two components: physical (hardening) and chemical (adhesion) ...|$|R
40|$|Master thesis - Norwegian {{university}} {{of science and}} Technology. Department of civil and transport engineering. This master thesis purports to address the effects of different filler types in asphalt mastics and relate the differences to asphalt mixture properties and volumetric composition. Due to variations in properties for different filler types, e. g. particle size, density, mineral composition, Rigden voids, specific surface area and binder interaction, the same filler amount by weight yields variations in occupied volume and bind different amounts of bitumen. Uncontrolled variations of the filler fraction can cause binder drainage {{as a result of}} insufficient reinforcement or a dry mixture with unsatisfactory coating of the aggregates. The literature review focused on outlining characteristics and effects of different <b>fillers</b> and <b>mastic</b> composition and to relate variations in mixture performance to filler types and the ratio of filler to binder. An experimental laboratory research has been conducted to evaluate the effects of using different filler types. Mixtures with limestone and hydrated lime have been compared to mixtures with natural sieved dust from Vassfjell and Steinkjer aggregates on the 0. 063 mm sieve. The results showed that the Rigden void content in the filler has an effect on the compacted asphalt mixture. Higher Rigden void content yields higher indirect tensile strength and a tendency to lower the abrasion resistance. The outcome from cyclic compression test was scattered, and there were too few data point to give any adequate conclusion. The tests showed that the F/A-ratio by mass or volume had less influence on the mixture performance. The air void content and the degree of compaction of the specimen greatly influenced the outcome, which coincide with results in the literature. The air void content was related to the Rigden void content, and in the literature it was found that higher Rigden void content in the filler gave higher air void content in the compacted specimens. Furthermore, increasing Rigden void content tended to increase the effective volumetric filler particle concentration in the mastics...|$|R

40|$|Roads {{form the}} {{lifeline}} of any country. It {{is considered to}} be an engineered structure and the pavement is expected to serve its designed life and meet the performance criteria for better economy. Various materials constitute the different layers of the pavement and their characterization becomes important for durability. In spite of these considerations however, many factors contribute to early pavement failure and improper material characterization is just one of them. The Bituminous mix which is used for the surface and binder courses is formed as a conglomeration of the binder, graded aggregates and voids which forms a stable mixture which can resist wear and tear as well as heavy wheel loads when used in the field. The bituminous mix needs to meet the volumetric requirements to attain stability. When bitumen is mixed with aggregates in a heated condition, the binder forms a coating around the aggregate particle which is termed as Asphalt film thickness (AFT) which is not measured but calculated. Bitumen due to its visco-elastic nature should be used at the optimum and the specified temperature to provide a minimum uniform film thickness to ensure proper bonding in the Bitumen <b>mastic.</b> <b>Fillers</b> {{play a major role in}} determining the properties and the behaviour of the mixture, especially the binding and aggregate interlocking effects. The filler has the ability to increase the resistance of particle to move within the mix matrix and/or works as an active material when it interacts with the asphalt cement to change the properties of the <b>mastic.</b> Mineral <b>fillers</b> serve a dual purpose when added to asphalt mixes, the portion of the mineral filler that is finer than the thickness of the asphalt film blends with asphalt cement binder to form a mortar or mastic that contributes to improved stiffening of the mix. In the present study the film thickness was determined by Hveem method by determining the total surface area and the effect of fillers thereon is discussed. The effect of types of fillers in varying percentage, in the performance of hot-mix-asphalt is also studied. Three types of fillers namely, Hydrated lime, Ordinary Portland Cement, and Fly ash were used as fillers in the present study. Their percentage by weight of aggregates was varied as 2 %, 4 % and 6 % to study their effect on the mix prepared for BC Grade II. The optimum binder content was determined for the various fillers and moisture susceptibility of bituminous mixtures was evaluated [...] The results of film thickness determination reveals that an average film thickness of 6 μm is obtained for all fillers which is necessary for durability of the mixes. The Fatigue results show that Lime at 4 % can be used for enhanced performance and 2 % is recommended, when cement or fly ash is used as filler material...|$|R
40|$|Asphalt mixture, {{the most}} common road {{construction}} material, comprises bitumen, filler, fine and coarse aggregates, and air voids. Traditionally and for simplification, the mixture is treated as a continuous and homogenous material confined {{in the domain of}} linear behaviour. The demand for more durable roads, particularly with the progressive growth in traffic volumes and loads, has raised the requirement for improved design methods. Wisely, before the complex adoption of the nonlinear behaviour, understanding the nature of the internal stress-strain relationships at different scales and determining their linearity limits is essentially required taking into consideration the time and temperature dependency. So far, most experimental programs have been concerned with testing either asphalt mixture or bitumen in isolation. This thesis is intended to establish a systematic experimental investigation from binder to the asphalt mixture scale in terms of permanent deformation behaviour. Preliminary conclusions of the components contributions, their interactions, and the effect on the total macroscopic response are drawn from the experimental observations. Investigation of the fillers influence on the viscoelastic property of the <b>mastic</b> (<b>filler</b> +bitumen) binder in the dynamic shear rheometer (DSR), results exhibited that binder behave nonlinearly at high shear stress levels and the linearity range reduces with increasing filler content and/or raising the temperature. Although filler inclusion increased the deformation resistance (stiffness) of the binder, its recoverability decreased. Consequently, a new binder rutting evaluation test was designed to distinguish between the two rutting resistance mechanisms; stiffness and recovery. Results from the new test indicated that the linearity of the modified binders begins after an initial inherent nonlinearity stage and before a secondary nonlinearity stage triggered by the applied state of stresses in the DSR. A new designed mortar type was developed from the mastic and originated from a standard asphalt mixture. The focus of this part in the research emphasised on measuring the stiffening effect of fine aggregates utilising a constitutive stress-strain relationship and determining the influence on the viscoelastic behaviour. Results indicated that the stiffening effect varies depending on the stress condition (uniaxial, triaxial, or shear), temperature, fine aggregate gradation, and binder with filler content. The stress linearity limit was also found to vary at different degrees with the previous parameters. Uniaxial compression constant stress and strain rate tests were conducted on asphalt mixtures of different aggregate gradations at 30 and 500 C. X-ray CT was incorporated to characterise the coarse aggregates and air voids through advanced image analysis techniques. The test was shown to be insensitive to the asphalt mixture type in terms of air voids uniformity. Mixtures of coarse aggregates produced larger size and smaller number of air voids, opposite to the fine aggregate ones. Comparing the stiffening effect between fine and coarse aggregates, it was revealed that the air void content is a key factor. Finally, the radial strain as measured along the height followed the pattern of air void distribution in the specimen and exhibited both tensile and compressive forms...|$|R
