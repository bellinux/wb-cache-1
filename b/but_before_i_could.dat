60|$|Still I hesitated, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak he {{anticipated}} me {{and returned}} to his fidelity.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{take her}} into mine, she uttered a little cry and shrank away.|$|E
60|$|<b>But,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> assure Mrs. Brown of the {{inefficiency}} of hair-dye as {{an internal}} application, she had darted from the room.|$|E
60|$|I had an {{impression}} that I had heard the voice <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not place it.|$|R
60|$|Back by {{the city}} of Kadabra lay a great fleet of mighty fliers--the ships of Helium and Ptarth that I had saved from {{destruction}} earlier in the day; <b>but</b> <b>before</b> ever <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reach them Thurid could easily make good his escape.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{noticed that}} {{they were on the}} table and in about the same place where they were {{standing}} the night <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not say exactly." ...|$|R
60|$|Now was my {{opportunity}} to make known my desire to be kept, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do so the boy hurriedly came into the room.|$|E
60|$|I {{opened my}} lips to {{protest against the}} implied {{comparison}} between a young lady and a hot gridiron, <b>but,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak, Morgan was gone.|$|E
60|$|I did {{not have}} time to conceal myself. I tried to step behind a partition, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> do so the merchant's eye was on me.|$|E
5000|$|According to the Mahavamsa, {{in about}} 1169, Kulasekhara besieged Madurai forcing the Pandyan king Parakrama Pandya {{to appeal to}} the Sri Lankan king Parakramabahu <b>I</b> for help. <b>But</b> <b>before</b> Parakramabahu <b>I's</b> army <b>could</b> reach Madurai, Parakrama Pandya had been killed and Kulasekhara had ascended the throne.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Allen Price rattled on in {{this fashion}} for some time, and at length I grew {{interested}} in the man in spite of myself. I was positive I had seen him <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> where <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not tell. <b>I</b> {{asked him if he}} had ever been to Darbyville.|$|R
60|$|It was at Westminster {{that the}} cause was to come on. It had come on there, I dare say, a hundred times <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not divest myself of an idea that it MIGHT lead to some result now. We left home {{directly}} after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and walked down there through the lively streets--so happily and strangely it seemed!--together.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yer," [...] said he; <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make {{a bundle}} of my load I saw him disappearing over a hill with the canoe on his head.|$|E
60|$|I {{sprang from}} my chariot, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reach the lioness hunters had run up with spears and stabbed her, which was easy {{as she could}} not move.|$|E
60|$|I {{stopped the}} {{preliminary}} slap, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hit him, his terrible left fist reached my head again; and down I fell once more--upon the hearth-rug this time--not over-heavily.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't care {{very much}} for the man, as <b>I</b> told you <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not see him remain there exposed to the fire of the enemy, and so without {{thinking}} twice I jumped up out of the trench and ran across the ground to where he was lying. The shells had torn the soil dreadfully, so that I had considerable difficulty in reaching him.|$|R
60|$|In {{those days}} of slow communication, I had to wait, not for days, <b>but</b> for weeks, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> expect to receive Sir James's answer. His letter only reached me after an unusually long delay. For this, or {{for some other}} reason that I cannot divine, I felt so {{strongly}} the foreboding of bad news that I abstained from breaking the seal in my mother's presence. I waited until <b>I</b> <b>could</b> retire to my own room, and then I opened the letter. My presentiment had not deceived me.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said she, [...] "I {{heard you}} <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not {{immediately}} determine {{what to say}} in reply. You wanted me, I know, to say 'Yes,' {{that you might have}} the pleasure of despising my taste; but I always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes, and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt. I have, therefore, made up my mind to tell you, that I do not want to dance a reel at all--and now despise me if you dare." ...|$|R
60|$|By way of answer I {{looked at}} him in a fashion which I trust he understood, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> speak, Vrouw Botmar broke in, for, as usual, I had translated.|$|E
60|$|There {{seemed to}} be {{something}} behind this remark, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> inquire into it we were interrupted by Mr. Cooke, who {{was standing on the}} beach, swearing and gesticulating for the boat.|$|E
60|$|<b>But</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> by protestations, plunge {{deeper than}} I stood already, the Duchesse turned the {{conversation}} adroitly {{to the matter}} of that letter of hers, wherein she had bidden me wait upon her.|$|E
5000|$|After {{just three}} months of college he left. Soon after he entered a writing contest and won $500. The same day his brother Bernard called him saying that their father was outside, {{with a gun in}} hand, waiting for their mother to come home. Leonard {{attacked}} his father and took the gun away. Leonard later wrote “I was deeply shocked, not because he was trying to kill my mother (he had tried it several times <b>before)</b> <b>but</b> because <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see myself ten years from now, standing inside my father’s skin.” ...|$|R
60|$|And now, in the {{managing}} my household affairs, I found myself wanting in many things, which I {{thought at first}} it was impossible for me to make, as indeed as to some of them it was; for instance, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never make a cask to be hooped; I had a small runlet or two, as <b>I</b> observed <b>before,</b> <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never arrive to the capacity of making one by them, though I spent many weeks about it; <b>I</b> <b>could</b> neither put in the heads, or joint the staves so true to one another as to make them hold water: so I gave that also over.|$|R
60|$|I am free {{to confess}} {{that when he}} thus left me at liberty there was but one thought in my mind, and that to seek my own safety in flight, {{regardless}} of my comrades, or of the old negro whose life might be in danger if I thus deserted him. I was cowardly enough for an instant to think only of myself, to look forward only {{to the possibility of}} saving my own skin; <b>but,</b> fortunately, even <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have turned to flee like a poltroon, I realized that it was my duty as a lad of Virginia, even though I had seemingly thrown aside the name of Minute Boy, to remain with my comrades whom I had thus counselled into peril.|$|R
6000|$|After breakfast, I {{decided to}} go down to the village, and see if Poirot had {{returned}} yet; <b>but,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> start, a well-known face blocked one of the windows, and the well-known voice said: ...|$|E
60|$|She {{held out}} her hand to me, <b>but,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> take it, withdrew it and, {{covering}} her face, began to cry. Presently recovering herself and turning towards the house, she asked me to follow.|$|E
60|$|I {{took a step}} forward, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{gain the}} threshold, the door was slammed in my face, and as I stood there, quivering with anger and disappointment, I heard the bolts being shot within.|$|E
6000|$|... "Perfectly, sir! Perfectly! As {{plain as}} I see this julep <b>before</b> me. <b>I</b> {{had just left}} the Ramierez rancho. The senora,--a devilish pretty woman, sir,--after a little playful badinage, had offered to lend me her daughter's mustang if <b>I</b> <b>could</b> ride it home. You know what it is, Mr. Grey," [...] he said gallantly. [...] "I'm an older man than you, sir, but a {{challenge}} from a d----d fascinating creature, I trust, sir, I am not yet old enough to decline. Gad, sir, I mounted the brute. I've ridden Morgan stock and Blue Grass thoroughbreds bareback, sir, but I've never thrown my leg over such a blanked Chinese cracker before. After he bolted I held my own fairly, <b>but</b> he buck-jumped <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> lock my spurs under him, and the second jump landed me!" ...|$|R
50|$|Around me <b>I</b> <b>could</b> hear {{concrete}} cracking. I {{started back}} to the car to get the dog, <b>but</b> was thrown <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reach it. The car itself began to slide from side to side on the roadway. I decided the bridge was breaking up and my only hope was to get back to shore.""On hands and knees most of the time, I crawled 500 yards or more to the towers… My breath was coming in gasps; my knees were raw and bleeding, my hands bruised and swollen from gripping the concrete curb… Toward the last, I risked rising to my feet and running a few yards at a time… Safely back at the toll plaza, I saw the bridge in its final collapse and saw my car plunge into the Narrows.|$|R
60|$|I {{lay down}} in the old little bed in {{the stern of the}} boat, and the wind came moaning on across the flat as it had done <b>before.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not help fancying, now, that it moaned of those who were gone; and instead of {{thinking}} that the sea might rise in the night and float the boat away, I thought of the sea that had risen, since I last heard those sounds, and drowned my happy home. I recollect, as the wind and water began to sound fainter in my ears, putting a short clause into my prayers, petitioning that I might grow up to marry little Em'ly, and so dropping lovingly asleep.|$|R
60|$|He {{held out}} his hand and clasped mine for a moment. I would have spoken, <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> find words he had {{disappeared}} through a curtained door into his inner apartment. So I turned away and went.|$|E
60|$|Zenobia turned, sidelong, {{a strange}} {{kind of a}} glance upon me; <b>but,</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> make out what it meant, we had entered the kitchen, where, in {{accordance}} with the rustic simplicity of our new life, the supper-table was spread.|$|E
60|$|I nodded. Once more, as his earnest glance {{fell upon}} me, came that {{suggestion}} of a subtle, inexplicable link between us; <b>but</b> <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reply, steps were heard behind us, and an elderly servant, bareheaded, was seen coming down the path.|$|E
6000|$|I was {{prepared}} to be watched on the way from Blackwater Park to the station, exactly as I had been watched in London the day <b>before.</b> <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not discover at the time, whether I was really followed on this occasion or not. The man in black might have had means of tracking me at his disposal of which I was not aware, but I certainly saw nothing of him, in his own person, either {{on the way to}} the station, or afterwards on my arrival at the London terminus in the evening. I reached home on foot, taking the precaution, <b>before</b> <b>I</b> approached our own door, of walking round by the loneliest street in the neighbourhood, and there stopping and looking back more than once over the open space behind me. I had first learnt to use this stratagem against suspected treachery in the wilds of Central America--and now I was practising it again, with the same purpose and with even greater caution, in the heart of civilised London! ...|$|R
60|$|The feeble {{gas flame}} {{in the hall}} was still there, on duty, {{as though it had}} never been turned off since I last crossed the hall at half-past eleven in the evening to go to the harbour. The small flame had watched me letting myself out; and now, exactly of the same size, the poor little tongue of light (there was {{something}} wrong with that burner) watched me letting myself in, as indeed it had done many times before. Generally the impression was that of entering an untenanted house, <b>but</b> this time <b>before</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> reach {{the foot of the stairs}} Therese glided out of the passage leading into the studio. After the usual exclamations she assured me that everything was ready for me upstairs, had been for days, and offered to get me something to eat at once. I accepted and said I would be down in the studio in half an hour. I found her there by the side of the laid table ready for conversation. She began by telling me—the dear, poor young Monsieur—in a sort of plaintive chant, that there were no letters for me, no letters of any kind, no letters from anybody. Glances of absolutely terrifying tenderness mingled with flashes of cunning swept over me from head to foot while I tried to eat.|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{the time}} I {{talked to him}} I didn't see a muscle move in his face," [...] Jethro continued, [...] "so I started in again, and he looked--looked--looked right at me. W-wouldn't wink--don't think he winked once while I was in that room. I watched him as close as <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> and <b>I</b> watched {{to see if a}} muscle moved or if I was makin' any impression. All he would do was to stand there and look--look--look. K-kept me there ten minutes and never opened his mouth at all. Hardest man to talk to I ever met--never see a man <b>before</b> <b>but</b> what <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get him to say somethin', if it was only a cuss word. I got tired of it after a while, made up my mind that I had found one man I couldn't move. Then what bothered me was {{to get out of that}} room. If I'd a had a Bible I believe I'd a read it to him. I didn't know what to say, but I did say this after a while:--"'W-well, Mr. President, I guess I've kept you long enough--g-guess you're a pretty busy man. H-hope you'll give Mr. Prescott that postmastership. Er--er good-by.' ...|$|R
