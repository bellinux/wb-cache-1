This <b>research</b> presents <b>background</b> <b>information</b> and <b>research</b> <b>on</b> situational judgment tests and several constructs hypothesized to influence situational judgment test responses. A situational judgment test and manipulations to influence response patterns were developed and piloted with {{a small sample of}} management professionals and undergraduate students. Larger samples of management professionals and undergraduate students participated in the experimental research. Participants were asked to imagine that they are applying for a job. Each participant was presented with <b>background</b> <b>information</b> about a fictitious company, describing a company as either highly Participative/Supportive or highly Directive/Achieving in its leadership culture. A third description provided no information about leadership culture to serve as a control. Participants responded to a situational judgment test consisting of some commercially developed items and some new items. Then participants responded to an inventory comprised of items that measure the factors hypothesized to influence response patterns, specifically Agreeableness and Experience. Significant differences in response patterns were determined to be attributable to the Agreeableness and Experience variables, and the Leadership Culture manipulations, as well as the interaction between Experience and the Leadership Culture manipulations. No significant differences were clearly attributable to the Agreeableness by Leadership Culture interaction. The ramifications of these findings are discussed and recommendations for future research are presented...|$|R

This paper provides <b>background</b> <b>information</b> <b>on</b> <b>research</b> that has addressed the endocrine disruption issue in the Canadian aquatic environment as well as information on studies that are presently being conducted within the country to address this issue. Two of the three studies from across the world often cited as presenting sufficient evidence for connecting contaminants and endocrine disruption in fish populations are Canadian — Lake Ontario lake trout and TCDD and related compounds, and white sucker exposed to bleached kraft pulp mill effluent. Several other Canadian examples exist, including altered stress responses in yellow perch exposed to heavy metals, altered smoltification in Atlantic salmon exposed to 4 -nonylphenol and imposex in dogwelks exposed to tributyltin. While other Canadian studies suggest alterations in reproductive function in fish, direct links to contaminants have not been made. Other studies have identified endocrine active compounds in the receiving environments but have yet to link these to alterations in endocrine function in resident fish populations. The strength of Canada’s research programs lies in the breadth and depth of their field related research. It is this world-recognized expertise and strength that Canada can contribute to the international effort to address the endocrine disruptor issue...|$|R

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of timber structures is largely {{governed by the}} design and effectiveness of the connections. Connections with long axially loaded self-tapping screws or threaded rods embedded with an inclination to the grain direction can be an alternative to connections with dowel-type fasteners or glued-in rods. Self-tapping screws and especially threaded rods with large diameters feature high withdrawal capacity and stiffness. This ability makes them suitable as fasteners in connections in order to realize stiff and strong joints. Eurocode 5 does not provide rules for the estimation of the withdrawal stiffness of axially loaded fasteners, which {{is necessary for the}} determination of the stiffness of connections. Some rules can be found in technical approvals; however they are only valid for the instantaneous withdrawal stiffness under service load of self-tapping screws with small diameters. Consequently, there is a complete lack of guidelines for the estimation of the withdrawal stiffness of threaded rods with larger diameters. Moreover, Eurocode 5 imposes a limitation to the angle between the rod-axis and the grain direction (α ≥ 30 °) without taking into account that splitting may be prevented by reinforcement. The lack of knowledge of proper design, documentation of mechanical behaviour, design guidelines and design codes for threaded rods are barriers for the development of timber connections with these fasteners. The withdrawal properties (capacity and stiffness) of axially loaded threaded rods were investigated in the present thesis by use of experimental, analytical and numerical methods. An overview of the <b>background</b> <b>information</b> and <b>research</b> <b>on</b> withdrawal of screws and threaded rods is presented in Part I of the present thesis. Part II consists of 4 appended papers where the findings of this Ph. D. project are presented. Part III consists of 3 appendices where some analytical remarks together with the detailed experimental and numerical results are presented. The review on the existing approaches and experimental results have shown that, up-to-date, most research effort has been devoted on the determination of the withdrawal strength of self-tapping screws with diameters up to 12 - 14 mm. On the contrary, available research results for threaded rods with larger diameters are sparse {{and the vast majority of}} these results are limited to relatively stocky rods embedded either parallel or perpendicular to the grain. Therefore, the effect of the rod-to-grain angle and the embedment length on the withdrawal properties remains unknown. The parameters of the experimental investigation were the rod-to-grain angle (α = 0 - 90 °) and the embedment length (l = 100 - 600 mm). Specimens with single rods and with a pair of rods (arranged in a row perpendicular to the plane of the grain) embedded in glued-laminated timber (abbr. glulam) elements were tested. Moreover, an analytical approach based on Volkersen theory and a bi-linear constitutive relationship was used for the estimation of the elastic and post-elastic withdrawal properties. Finally, Finite Element (abbr. FE) simulations were performed to estimate the instantaneous withdrawal stiffness (under service load) and the elastic distributions of stresses and displacements. According to experimental observation, the specimens exhibited high withdrawal capacity and stiffness (without initial soft response). Based on the experimental results, the necessary input parameters for the analytical method were quantified. In particular, simple expressions for the mean and 5...|$|R

40|$|Breakwaters are {{important}} objects to protect coastal- and harbour areas. To minimalize {{the probability of}} failure of breakwaters, {{a lot of research}} has been conducted concerning the stability of breakwaters. After Iribarren and Hudson, an influential research is conducted by Van der Meer. The literature research of this report will provide more <b>background</b> <b>information</b> concerning their <b>researches</b> <b>on</b> the stability of breakwaters. Van der Meer tested three sorts of breakwater constructions. The first breakwater structure contained a homogeneous construction (P= 0. 6) The second and third structure consisted of respectively a construction with impermeable core (P= 0. 1) and a structure with a filter layer and a permeable core (P= 0. 5). These variants of breakwaters were constructed with different slopes angles to require as much information possible concerning the stability of breakwaters. Van der Meer discovered two formulas for the stability of breakwaters. The first formula is used for plunging waves while the second formula is used for surging waves. Within these formulas, important factors as damage, wave height and notional permeability are included. The most important parameter of the formulas of Van der Meer is the notional permeability factor P. Van der Meer conducted his <b>research</b> <b>on</b> three different constructions and has designed a fourth construction based on the stability curves. This fourth construction has a value of permeability of 0. 4. This value is estimated based on curve fitting. Following the research done by Van der Meer, Kik has subsequently researched the notional permeability of three breakwater constructions. Firstly, Kik repeated the test with a construction of impermeable core (model 1 /P= 0. 08) and the test with the construction of filter layer and permeable core (model 2 / P= 0. 05) of Van der Meer. Lastly, Kik did a third test existing of a variant of the design of the fourth construction of Van der Meer (model 3 / P= 0. 35). Concluding from his research, Kik stated that the ‘Root mean square equation’ is a reliable method to determine the notional permeability P. During this research the influence of the thickness of the filter layer on the notional permeability P is studied. This research will also try to answer the question whether other relevant aspects might influence the notional permeability as well. The elaboration of this research is performed in a practical way in a wave flume in the water laboratory of the faculty of civil engineering of the TU Delft. Scale models of the breakwaters were constructed to test the notional permeability of the breakwaters. In the water laboratory three models were tested. Firstly, model 3 of Kik is repeated as model 3 A, with a calculated value of notional permeability P 0. 38. The construction of model 3 A is build with a top layer, filter layer 1, filter layer 2 and a impermeable core. Second, another variant of model 3 of Kik is designed and tested (model 4). However, the measured damage figures were too low and therefore they could not be used to calculate a value for the notional permeability P. The construction of model four is build with a top layer, filter layer 1, filter layer 2 which is thicker as model 3 A and an impermeable core. Finally, model 5 is tested with a calculated value of notional permeability of P 0. 45. This model is designed from the fourth construction of Van der Meer. The construction of model 5 is build with a top layer, filter layer 1 and a permeable core with the same material of filter layer 2 of model 3 A and model 4. The results of this research show that the influences of the notional permeability P exists of the ratio of the armour layer thickness and the thickness of the second filter layer. If the layer thicknesses are equal the value for notional permeability P is 0. 38, which follows from model 3 A. If the second layer has an infinite thickness (permeable core), the value for notional permeability P is 0. 45, which follows from model 5. The value of the notional permeability P of model 5 corresponds to the design calculations of the computer model HADEER. Van der Meer discovered using this computer model that the ratio of dn 50 a/ dn 50 f = 5 has a value on the notional permeability P of 0. 43 – 0. 44. During this research, while using two different methods, a value of the notional permeability P of 0. 45 was calculated. coastal engineeringHydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
