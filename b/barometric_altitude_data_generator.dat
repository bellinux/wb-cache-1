40|$|The use of {{barometric}} altimetry is to {{some extent}} a limiting factor on safety, predictability and efficiency of aircraft operations, and reduces {{the potential of the}} trajectory based operations capabilities. However, geometric altimetry could be used to improve all of these aspects. Nowadays aircraft altitude is estimated by applying the International Standard Atmosphere which differs from real altitude. At different temperatures for an assigned <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude,</b> aerodynamic forces are different and this has a direct relationship with time, fuel consumption and range of the flight. The study explores the feasibility of using sensors providing geometric reference altitude, in particular, to supply capabilities for the optimization of vertical profiles and also, their impact on the vertical Air Traffic Management separation assurance processes. One of the aims of the thesis is to assess if geometric altitude fulfils the aeronautical requirements through existing sensors. Also the thesis will elaborate on the advantages of geometric <b>altitude</b> over the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> in terms of efficiency for vertical navigation. The evidence that geometric altitude is the best choice to improve the efficiency in vertical profile and aircraft capacity by reducing vertical uncertainties will also be shown.

One of the air data parameters provided by this system is the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude.</b> The Bundeswehr Technical and Airworthiness Center for Aircraft (WTD 61) sought a deeper insight into the calibration of the air data system {{and the performance of}} the <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> measurement.

40|$|In {{the age of}} {{information}} the ability to navigate persons and equipment has become increasingly important. A rising number of applications and services depend on the precise positioning that is provided by global satellite positioning systems such as the GPS. However, most people using satellite-based positioning services {{are living in the}} most challenging surroundings for the satellite positioning systems - densely populated cities. Fundamentally, satellite navigation is based on distance measurements from the receiver to satellite vehicles in orbit of the Earth. The receiver determines its location - latitude, longitude, and elevation - and the system time using the satellite positioning system. The determined location is only an estimate: residual errors induce inaccuracies to the determination process. At worst, the receiver {{may not be able to}} determine its position if not enough signals could be acquired. The performance of the receiver could be greatly improved if one or more of the geographic coordinates or the precise time could be obtained from another source with smaller error. One such source is Earth's atmospheric pressure which is relative to the altitude and from which a receiver can deduce its altitude if a reference pressure level is known. To address the problem of unavailability and inaccuracy of positioning in urban environment, a barometric assistance service was designed and a respective software application was implemented. The implemented assistance service generates continuously time and location-dependent reference pressure data from high resolution weather forecasts that are calculated by the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Receivers with the barometric sensor can download the assistance data from the service and utilize it to determine the current <b>barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> consistently and more accurately than a conventional receiver. <b>Barometric</b> <b>altitude</b> measurements improve the availability of the positioning service and reduce the time required for the first position estimate by decreasing the number of required satellite measurements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to assess, for the first time, the {{accuracy}} of a low-cost global positioning system (GPS) receiver for estimating grade during outdoor walking. Thirty subjects completed outdoor walks (2. 0, 3. 5 and 5. 0 km. h(- 1)) in three randomized conditions: 1 /level walking on a 0. 0 % grade; 2 /graded (uphill and downhill) walking on a 3. 4 % grade; and 3 /on a 10. 4 % grade. Subjects were equipped with a GPS receiver (DG 100, GlobalSat Technology Corp., Taiwan; similar to US 75). The GPS receiver was set to record at 1 Hz and its antenna was placed on the right shoulder. Grade was calculated from GPS speed and <b>altitude</b> <b>data</b> (grade = <b>altitude</b> variation/travelled distance x 100). Two methods were used for the grade calculation: one using uncorrected <b>altitude</b> <b>data</b> given by the GPS receiver and another one using corrected <b>altitude</b> <b>data</b> obtained using map projection software (CartoExploreur, version 3. 11. 0, build 2. 6. 6. 22, Bayo Ltd, Appoigny, France, similar to US 35). Linear regression of GPS-estimated versus actual grade with R- 2 coefficients, bias with 95 % limits of agreement (+/- 95 % LoA), and typical error of the estimate with 95 % confidence interval (TEE (95 % CI)) were computed to assess the accuracy of the GPS receiver. 444 walking periods were performed. Using uncorrected <b>altitude</b> <b>data,</b> we obtained: R- 2 = 0. 88 (p < 0. 001), bias = 0. 0 +/- 6. 6 %, TEE between 1. 9 (1. 7 - 2. 2) % and 4. 2 (3. 6 - 4. 9) % according to the grade level.
