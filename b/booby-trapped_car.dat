50|$|McMichael held {{political}} office {{as leader of}} the Ulster Democratic Party (UDP) from 1981 until his death. He was killed outside his home by a <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb which was carried out by the Provisional IRA. There were allegations that members within the UDA had colluded with the IRA in his death by passing on vital information about him and his activities, enabling the IRA to target his car.|$|R
50|$|Federal Police Chief Jawdat {{issued a}} {{statement}} on 10 June saying that his forces had completely captured the Zanjili district, killing hundreds of militants and destroying 27 heavy machine guns, as well as dozens of <b>booby-trapped</b> <b>cars.</b> Iraqi forces meanwhile repelled an ISIL offensive {{to the south of}} Shirqat, with the group losing 24 fighters, while the combined death toll of troops and civilians rose to 38.

5000|$|In the 1980s, {{persistent}} {{allegations of}} stealing UDA funds were levelled {{against him and}} he made many enemies within the organisation. The UDA also accused him of complicity in the assassination of South Belfast brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up in a <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb planted by the IRA outside his Lisburn home on 22 December 1987. In that same year, the police were {{aware that he was}} involved in an operation to steal weapons from an army base.|$|R
5000|$|John McMichael {{was blown}} up by a <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb outside his Lisburn home on 22 December 1987. Although the IRA claimed {{responsibility}} for the attack, there were suggestions that members of the UDA helped set up the killing by passing on information to the IRA about McMichael to facilitate the assassination. Lyttle put the blame on his long-time rival James Pratt Craig, the UDA's notorious [...] "fundraiser", who had been under investigation by McMichael for his racketeering activities. There was considerable animosity between the two UDA men, as Craig had allegedly impregnated one of Lyttle's daughters.|$|R
50|$|Jawdat stated on 16 June {{that the}} Iraqi Police had {{taken control of}} 30 percent of Shifaa district. Meanwhile, UNHCR stated that 100,000 civilians still {{remained}} in the Old City and were practically human shields. Iraqi forces killed an estimated 1,800 ISIL militants during the first 16 days in June. On 17 June, Jawdat stated that Iraqi forces had captured the medical complex in Shifaa, killing 19 fighters in the clashes in addition to destroying six <b>booby-trapped</b> <b>cars</b> and four motorbikes. ISIL training centers {{in the vicinity of}} al-Jamhouri Hospital in al-Shifaa district have also been destroyed, and the hospital was successfully cordoned off. Lise Grande meanwhile stated that up to 150,000 civilians still remained in Old City.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was accused}} by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) {{of setting up}} the assassinations {{of some of their}} key members by IRA hit squads, such as Shankill Butcher Lenny Murphy, John Bingham, and William [...] "Frenchie" [...] Marchant in the 1980s. Craig was killed by the UDA, using their cover name of the Ulster Freedom Fighters (UFF), for alleged [...] "treason" [...] as it was {{believed}} he had passed information to the IRA regarding South Belfast UDA brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up in an IRA <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb in December 1987. Craig was shot dead in The Castle Inn, a pub in Beersbridge Road, East Belfast. An elderly pensioner was also killed by stray gunfire.|$|R
5000|$|According to Dillon, Marchant {{had been}} due to meet Craig outside [...] "The Eagle" [...] before he was shot dead. Instead {{of getting out of}} the car at the chip shop where Marchant waited, Craig got out at the Inter-City {{furniture}} shop on the corner of Conway Street. There he engaged in conversation with another person for five minutes. Within the five minutes, Marchant was gunned down just 50 yards away. In October 1988, Craig was shot to death in an East Belfast pub by the UDA (using their cover name Ulster Freedom Fighters) for [...] "treason", claiming that he had been involved in the death of UDA leader John McMichael, who was blown up the previous December in a <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb planted by the IRA.|$|R

50|$|Later {{that year}} Tommy Herron was shot dead, Jim Anderson had voluntarily stood down, and Andy Tyrie was {{appointed}} chairman. Tyrie, an early recruit from the WDA, soon became the UDA's Supreme Commander, {{a position he}} would hold until March 1988 when an attempted car-bombing brought about his retirement. Less than four months before on 27 December 1987, the Provisional IRA had succeeded in blowing up influential South Belfast brigadier John McMichael in a <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb outside his home. Charles Harding Smith was long out of the picture. From 1973 to 1975, he had {{tried in vain to}} wrest the UDA leadership from Tyrie; finally he had been forced to leave Northern Ireland after surviving several assassination attempts by republicans and by members of the pro-Tyrie faction.|$|R
5000|$|Sporadic clashes {{continued}} {{even after}} al-Abadi's victory declaration, {{specifically in the}} al-Maydan area of the Old City, with multiple airstrikes pounding the area. An Iraqi official stated that the military activity was due to clearing operations, targeting hidden militants. On 13 July, the US stated there could be 200 ISIL fighters remaining {{in the city and}} the Coalition conducted air-strikes against 19 ISIL fighting positions. Another 22 fighting positions and a tunnel were destroyed by the CJTF-OIR the next day, as Iraqi forces hit further pockets of resistance. On 15 July, Lieutenant General Abdul-Amir Yarallah, head of the Nineveh Operations at the Joint Operations Command stated that over 25,000 militants were killed in the battle, including 450 suicide bombers. He also added that 1,247 <b>booby-trapped</b> <b>cars,</b> 1,500 [...] "diverse vehicles", and 130 drones were shot down.|$|R
2500|$|By {{the early}} 1990s, a new {{leadership}} had emerged on the Shankill Road following {{the killing of}} powerful South Belfast Brigadier and UDA Deputy Commander John McMichael in 1987 by a <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb planted by the Provisional IRA; {{less than three months}} later, Supreme Commander Andy Tyrie resigned after an attempt was made on his life. He was not replaced; instead the organisation was run by its Inner Council. With the West Belfast UDA brigadier and spokesman Tommy Lyttle in prison and gradually eased out of the leadership, Adair, as the most ambitious of the [...] "Young Turks", established himself as head of the UDA's [...] "C Company", 2nd Battalion based on the Shankill. Adair formed a so-called [...] "Dream Team" [...] of active gunmen, with many of his friends from his former skinhead gang including Sam [...] "Skelly" [...] McCrory, Mo Courtney, [...] "Fat" [...] Jackie Thompson, and Donald Hodgen recruited into the unit.|$|R
5000|$|In December 1987, when South Belfast UDA brigadier John McMichael {{was blown}} {{up by an}} IRA <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb outside his home in Lisburn's Hilden estate, it was {{believed}} that Craig had organised his death with the IRA. Allegedly Craig had feared McMichael was about to expose his racketeering business, thus putting an end to his lucrative operation. McMichael had reportedly set up an inquiry and discovered that Craig was spending money on a lavish scale, going on holidays at least twice a year and indulging in a [...] "champagne lifestyle". At the same time it was suggested that Craig had made certain deals with Irish republican paramilitary groups, dividing up the rackets in west Belfast, and he would have been doing the IRA a favour by helping them to eliminate a high-profile loyalist such as McMichael. Craig had established links with republicans during his time in prison, and the profitable deals and exchanges of information between them ensured he would most likely not be a target for IRA assassination.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1980s, McDonald {{became part}} of UDA [...] "fundraiser" [...] Jim Craig's large {{protection}} racket. In 1988, just {{after the death of}} UDA's South Belfast brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up in a <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb planted by the Provisional IRA outside his home in Lisburn, Supreme Commander Andy Tyrie promoted McDonald to the rank of brigadier. He subsequently assumed command of McMichael's South Belfast brigade having previously served as his second-in-command. Described by Peter Taylor as an [...] "effective and popular commander", many people, however considered McDonald to have been one of Craig's [...] "henchmen in the latter's profitable racketeering business." [...] According to Steve Bruce Tyrie's appointment of McDonald as Brigadier helped to hasten Tyrie's own downfall due to the distaste with which McDonald was then regarded by a number of leading UDA figures. Due to his reputation as a racketeer and his close association with the widely disliked Craig and his equally loathed deputy and minder Artie Fee, a number of UDA modernisers, who were the chief critics of Tyrie, released statements to both the local media and BBC Newsnight condemning McDonald's appointment.|$|R
5000|$|In retaliation, the UVF killed Larry Marley, {{a leading}} IRA member from Ardoyne {{who was also}} a close friend of Sinn Féin {{president}} Gerry Adams. The IRA in their turn gunned down William [...] "Frenchie" [...] Marchant the following spring on the Shankill Road. The deaths of three leading UVF members caused suspicion amongst the UVF leadership that someone within their ranks was setting up high-ranking UVF men by passing on pertinent information to the IRA; therefore they decided to conduct an enquiry. Although it was revealed that the three men: Shankill Butcher Lenny Murphy, Bingham, and Marchant had all quarrelled with powerful UDA fund-raiser and racketeer James Pratt Craig prior to their deaths, the UVF did not believe the evidence was sufficient to warrant an attack against Craig, who ran a large protection racket in Belfast. Craig was later shot to death in an East Belfast pub by the UDA (using their [...] "Ulster Freedom Fighters" [...] covername) for [...] "treason", claiming he had been involved in the assassination of South Belfast UDA brigadier John McMichael, who was blown up by a <b>booby-trap</b> <b>car</b> bomb planted by the IRA outside his Lisburn home in December 1987.|$|R

2500|$|Despite the controversy, {{the device}} {{continued}} to be used at checkpoints across Iraq. The Iraqi Interior Ministry has defended the continued use of the ADE 651. In 2010, the then-head of the ministry's counter-explosives unit, General Jihad al-Jabiri, told the BBC that his organisation had [...] "conducted several tests on them, and found them successful. In addition, we {{have a series of}} achievements officially documented by the Baghdad operations centre, from all the provinces, which establish that these devices detected thousands of bombs, <b>booby-trapped</b> houses and <b>car</b> bombs, and we've noticed a reduction of bombing activities to less than 10 per cent of what it was." [...] A senior ministry official, Assistant Deputy Minister General Tareq al-Asl, told Asharq Al-Awsat: [...] "The reason the director of the company was arrested was not because the device doesn't work, but because he refused to divulge the secret of how it works to the British authorities, and the Americans before them.
