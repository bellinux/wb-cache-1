5|$|Flight {{testing of}} the XF-104s began with the first flight in March 1954, encountering several problems, {{some of which were}} resolved; however, {{performance}} of the XF-104 proved better than estimates and despite both prototypes being lost through accidents, the USAF ordered 17 service-test/pre-production YF-104As. Production Starfighters proved popular, <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> USAF and internationally, serving with a number of countries, including Jordan, Turkey, and Japan.|$|E
5|$|Harvey the Hound is the Flames' mascot. He {{was created}} in 1983 to serve <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Flames and the Calgary Stampeders of the Canadian Football League. Harvey was the first mascot in the NHL. Harvey is famous for an {{incident}} in January 2003 where he had his tongue ripped out by Edmonton Oilers head coach Craig MacTavish as he was harassing their bench. The incident made headlines throughout North America and led to much humour, including having many other NHL team mascots arrive at the 2003 All-Star Game with their tongues hanging out.|$|E

5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with the principles of the more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E
5|$|Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna Göteborg, {{commonly}} known as IFK Göteborg, is a Swedish professional football club based in Gothenburg. Founded on 4 October 1904, {{it is the only}} club in the Nordic countries that has won a pan-European competition, as the club won the UEFA Cup in 1982 and 1987. IFK is affiliated with Göteborgs Fotbollförbund and play their home games at Gamla Ullevi. The club colours are blue and white, colours shared <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> sports society—Idrottsföreningen Kamraterna—which the club originated from, and with the home town of Gothenburg.|$|E

5|$|The {{potatoes}} {{were chosen}} {{because they were}} deemed substantially equivalent to non-genetically modified Desiree Red potatoes. The study used two transgenic lines of potato, <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> GNA gene inserted. They were grown in the same conditions as the non-genetically modified parent plant. According to Pusztai, the potatoes were not substantially equivalent, {{as one of the}} transgenic lines contained 20 percent less protein than the other, and the starch and sugar contents varied by up to 20 percent among the three lines. Pusztai claimed that these differences were reason enough to discontinue further experimentation.|$|E
5|$|Arcona {{served in}} all three German navies {{in the first half}} of the 20th century. She served <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fleet and abroad during her career in the Imperial Navy in the early 1900s. In World War I, she was used as a coastal defense ship and then as a support vessel for the U-boat {{campaign}} in the Atlantic. After the war, she served briefly in the Reichsmarine before being withdrawn and used for secondary duties. After the German Navy became the Kriegsmarine in 1935, it rebuilt Arcona as a floating anti-aircraft battery and used her to defend several German ports during World War II. She was scuttled in the final days of the war, and broken up for scrap in 19481949.|$|E

5|$|During the decade, Richardson made {{numerous}} sound recordings. For the Caedmon Audio label he re-created {{his role}} as Cyrano de Bergerac opposite Anna Massey as Roxane, and played the title role in a complete recording of Julius Caesar, with a cast that included Anthony Quayle as Brutus, John Mills as Cassius and Alan Bates as Antony. Other Caedmon recordings were Measure for Measure, The School for Scandal and No Man's Land. Richardson also recorded some English Romantic poetry, including The Rime of the Ancient Mariner and poems by Keats and Shelley for the label. For Decca Records Richardson recorded the narration for Prokofiev's Peter and the Wolf, and for RCA the superscriptions for Vaughan Williams's Sinfonia antartica – <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> London Symphony Orchestra, the Prokofiev conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent and the Vaughan Williams by André Previn.|$|E
5|$|Jesé {{is able to}} play {{across the}} front line, {{operating}} either as an attacking midfielder, second striker or centre-forward, or in his favoured position out on the wing. During his time at the Castilla, Jesé was often deployed in a false 9 role in the team's 4–3–3 formation, and regularly switched flanks due to his ability to use both feet. In 2013, {{in his role as}} the club's sporting director at the time, Zinedine Zidane declared himself an admirer of Jesé's direct style of football and goal scoring ability. Following Jesé's promotion to Real Madrid's first team in 2013, manager Carlo Ancelotti played him in a winger position, where he could cut inside from the wing <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> ball and without, to create chances and score goals.|$|E

5|$|Submarine {{films have}} their own {{particular}} meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of submarine warfare. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the soundtrack, which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in Wolfgang Petersen's 1981 Das Boot, the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with depth charges, the ping of sonar, and threatening sounds such as of the propellors of enemy destroyers and torpedoes. Classic films in the genre include The Enemy Below (1957) and Run Silent, Run Deep (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. Run Silent, Run Deep is a movie full of tension, <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by Clark Gable and Burt Lancaster.|$|E
5|$|The revolt {{started in}} Nablus with the Palestinian general strike in April 1936. The strike spread {{to a number}} of cities {{throughout}} Palestine, including Tulkarm where al-Hajj Muhammad helped organize the campaign. By the summer of that year, several Palestinian Arab rebel bands had sprung up, including the forces of al-Hajj Muhammad. The latter used existing social networks and the complex web of local clan politics to build alliances <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> middle classes of the major towns, particularly the well-educated activists, and the rural clan elders to build a solid base of resistance against the British. In order to avoid detection, al-Hajj Muhammad refrained from commanding a large unit of troops. Instead, he raised small, semi-permanent bands of volunteers called fasa'il (sing. fasl) as he moved from one area to another. They normally launched nighttime attacks against specific targets.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately for James, {{negotiation}} with Spain proved generally unpopular, <b>both</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> public and with James's court. The English Parliament was actively hostile towards Spain and Catholicism, and thus, when called by James in 1621, the members hoped for an enforcement of recusancy laws, a naval campaign against Spain, and a Protestant marriage for the Prince of Wales. James's Lord Chancellor, Francis Bacon, was impeached before the House of Lords for corruption. The impeachment {{was the first}} since 1459 without the king's official sanction {{in the form of}} a bill of attainder. The incident set an important precedent as the process of impeachment would later be used against Charles and his supporters: the Duke of Buckingham, Archbishop Laud, and the Earl of Strafford. James insisted that the House of Commons be concerned exclusively with domestic affairs, while the members protested that they had the privilege of free speech within the Commons' walls, demanding war with Spain and a Protestant Princess of Wales. Charles, like his father, considered the discussion of his marriage in the Commons impertinent and an infringement of his father's royal prerogative. In January 1622, James dissolved Parliament, angry at what he perceived as the members' impudence and intransigence.|$|E
