5000|$|The {{story from}} the {{unfinished}} After the Incal was rewritten to provide a separate narrative for this volume. The story starts after The Incal climax in which John DiFool encountered a flowing-bearded divine being named Orh, witnessing a universe-shaking event, hurtling towards certain death in the acid lake. DiFool forgets about the cosmic encounter, and recovers his memory as the universe faces a threat of a metallic virus. The Prezident was cloned in metallic body, equipped with both chemical and brutal weapons, but also altered mind - operating {{under the influence of}} the [...] "destroyer of all living things", the Bentacodon (equivalent to The Incals Black Egg). He unleashed destructive organic virus called the <b>Biophage</b> 13-X with the purpose of forcing the population to abandon their natural bodies in favor of robotic ones. The only way to counteract is to reunite John DiFool with his true love, Luz de Garra (from Before the Incal), and the Elohim (a force of goodness) makes four John DiFools from different realities to encounter each other on a quest to find her. It is ridiculed the ego of the allegedly evolved guru DiFool and the super-evolved [...] "angelic" [...] DiFool, and the least enlightened DiFool, the ugliest and most craven, is selected to save the universe. In the end, the cosmic humanity managed to become one collective consciousness, as a true love saves from turning into unfeeling metallic beings.|$|E
