5|$|The cup {{appears in}} another {{inventory}} of CharlesV in 1400, {{and then is}} not recorded until it appears as the property of another royal uncle, and collector, John of Lancaster, 1st Duke of Bedford (1389–1435), son of HenryIV, who was briefly Regent of both France and England for his infant nephew HenryVI. How he acquired the cup is not known, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> received many gifts from CharlesVI, and had both lent the king money and bought from him things such as the library of the Palais du Louvre, in the uneasy period when Charles had made peace with the English and made HenryV his heir. After {{the death of his}} brother HenryV, Bedford struggled to stem the resurgent French resistance, which was energised by Joan of Arc. He died in Normandy in 1435, leaving HenryVI as his heir.|$|E

25|$|Another {{argument}} Al-Khoei {{brings up}} {{in favor of}} the Quran is that by the time ‘Uthman became caliph, Islam had spread {{to such an extent that}} it was impossible for him, or even for anyone more powerful than him, to remove anything from the Quran. The value and importance of the Quran during this time protected it from being altered. In the oral culture at this time, people paid great attention to memorizing pre-Islamic Arabic poetry, it is hard to imagine that they did not pay similar attention to the preservation of the Book of the Almighty, especially since they believed they would be rewarded in the hereafter for memorizing it. Uthman could have altered the text, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been unable to remove the Quran from the hearts of the Muslims who had memorized it.|$|E
25|$|Snape's {{memories}} then {{reveal that}} Dumbledore had impetuously {{tried to use}} the Gaunt ring which had been cursed by Voldemort, and had been suffering from a powerful curse. Snape's knowledge of the Dark Arts enabled him to slow {{the spread of the}} curse from Dumbledore's hand through his body, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> died within a year. Dumbledore, aware that Voldemort had ordered Draco to kill him, had asked Snape to kill him instead as a way of sparing the boy's soul and of preventing his own otherwise slow, painful death. Although Snape was reluctant, even asking about the impact of such an action on his own soul, Dumbledore implied that this kind of coup de grâce would not damage a human's soul in the same way murder would. Snape agreed to do as the Headmaster requested. Snape's memories also provide Harry with the information he needs to ensure Voldemort's final defeat, in the form of conversations Snape had with Dumbledore.|$|E
25|$|The {{painting}} is unfinished. Zoffany {{is thought to}} have based the painting on another made of Cook's death by John Webber who was the official artist on Cook's third voyage. Zoffany had been invited at one time to be an artist on one of Cook's voyages and it is thought that he may have previously painted Cook. Webber had not witnessed the death of Cook, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> known many of the people involved. He would have known the English sailors but he would also have seen many of the natives. When Cook and his men visited Hawaii for the second time they spent some time on the main island of Hawaii where he had been received many gifts from the Hawaiian Chief including a feather cape and feathered helmet. Cook had been killed when he returned to Hawaii only two weeks after his second visit. His unplanned return to the island was due to a storm. Cook angered the native people by attempting to take the local chief, Kalaniʻōpuʻu, as a hostage {{in order to get a}} missing boat returned. In the confusion, Cook shot a man and in the aftermath he and four marines were speared to death; the death appears unintended. Cook's replacement, Captain Clerke, was able to very quickly reestablish a relationship with the Hawaiians, and they left with little ill will.|$|E

500|$|Toivonen {{was known}} as a {{competitive}} driver both on loose (gravel, dirt, sand, snow and ice) and tarmac surfaces, and he found it difficult to choose between circuit racing and rallying. After becoming a rally driver, he still competed in some circuit racing events, successfully in two World Sportscar Championship events and also in a few races for Eddie Jordan's British Formula Three Championship team. Jordan called Toivonen's performances [...] "incredible" [...] and compared him to Ayrton Senna. After Toivonen's death, Jordan weighed in on his chances in Formula One: [...] "I don't know if he would have become a champion in Formula One. It always takes a lot of luck, and now [...] one can doubt if he would have been granted that. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> won Grands Prix– of that I'm absolutely sure." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1976, the Bruins offered Orr US$600,000 (US$ in [...] dollars) per season, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> {{to pass a}} {{physical}} examination {{at the start of}} each season's training camp. Only the first year's money was guaranteed. Eagleson was quoted at the time as saying, [...] "There is only one way that Bobby Orr will ever be back with the Bruins. And that's if Jeremy Jacobs asks him for another meeting and straightens out the whole situation. Otherwise he's gone." [...] Instead, Orr became a free agent, with Boston to receive compensation. Orr and Eagleson whittled down a list of potential teams to St. Louis and Chicago. Chicago offered a five-year guaranteed contract with the Black Hawks, and on June 8, 1976, he officially signed with the Black Hawks. The Bruins' general manager, Harry Sinden complained of tampering by the Black Hawks, and demanded that Chicago owner Bill Wirtz submit to a lie detector test. According to documents held by Orr, they had a valid case. Orr signed with the Black Hawks at a secret meeting in May 1976, prior to becoming a free agent.|$|E

2500|$|Meena Kumari {{agreed to}} all terms, but with passing time she kept {{breaking}} them. It is said Kumari felt oppressed by the feudal attitude and high-handed behavior that Kamal Amrohi brought to their relationship. Kamal Amrohi's lavish productions Daera and Pakeezah, and his Kamalistan studios (1958) were mostly financed by Kumari's earnings. Meena Kumari was watched over. Kamal Amrohi had issued strict instructions and had deployed assistant Baqar Ali {{to prevent any}} other man from meeting Meena Kumari on the sets. In 1972 Kamal Amrohi told Vinod Mehta (writer of Meena Kumari - The Classic Biography) [...] "I didn't mean it like that. These were just ground rules. I mean, if she returned home at 7 instead of 6:30 it was acceptable for me. I just wanted her to appreciate that besides having responsibilities to her career, she had responsibilities to her home and husband". Amrohi further {{said that he was}} prepared to overlook Meena bending his conditions, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> loved it if she herself confessed when such bendings took place. [...] "It really pained me to learn of these incidents from outside sources".|$|E
2500|$|Having {{become a}} popular fighter in Japan due to his {{technical}} diversity, spectacular aesthetics, tactics and strength, Andy Hug made the switch from Kyokushinkaikan to Seidokaikan in 1992, completing the step from being an amateur to becoming a professional fighter and star in Japan. After winning the 1992 Seidokaikan Karate World Cup, beating Taiei Kin in the final, and finishing as runner-up to Masaaki Satake in the 1993 edition, Hug then transitioned to K-1 kickboxing, scoring a first round knockout of Ryuji Murakami in his professional debut at K-1 Andy's Glove in November 1993. After a breakout win over K-1 Grand Prix '93 Champion Branko Cikatić in March 1994, Hug entered the K-1 Grand Prix '94 a month later {{as one of the}} tournament favourites but was upset by Patrick Smith via first round stoppage in the quarter-finals. Undeterred, Hug continued to improve his skills for the kickboxing ring and rebounded by winning the Universal Kickboxing Federation (UKF) World Super Heavyweight Championship in December 1994 when he knocked out Rob van Esdonk. He suffered another setback at the K-1 Grand Prix '95 Qualifying Round when he was stopped by Mike Bernardo <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> his revenge the following year at the K-1 Grand Prix '96 when he won the tournament by finishing Bernardo with the [...] "Hug Tornado" [...] in the final. He continued to be one of K-1's top contenders in the following years, reaching the final of the K-1 World Grand Prix twice more (in 1997 and 1998) and becoming a three-time world champion by taking the WMTC and WKA titles under Muay Thai rules.|$|E
