40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Engineering Sciences (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The build–up of 6 Li and 3 He, that is, {{the strong}} thermal neutron {{absorbers}} or {{the so called}} "neutron poisons", in the <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> changes the physical characteristics of the reactor, such as reactivity, neutron spectra, neutron flux level, power distribution, etc.; furthermore,gaseous isotopes such as 3 H and 4 He induce swelling and embrittlement of the reflector. The SAFARI– 1 research reactor, operated by Necsa at Pelindaba in South Africa, uses a <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> on three sides of the core, consisting of 19 <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> elements in total. This MTR went critical in 1965, and the original beryllium reflectors are still used. The individual neutron irradiation history of each <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> element, {{as well as the}} impact of beryllium poisoning on reactor parameters, were never well known nor investigated before. Furthermore, in the OSCAR{ 3 code system used in predictive neutronic calculations for SAFARI– 1, <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> burn–up is not accounted for; OSCAR models the <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> as a non–burnable, 100 % pure material. As a result, the poisoning phenomenon is not accounted for. Furthermore, the criteria and hence the optimum replacement time of the reflector has never been developed. This study presents detailed calculations, using MCNP, FISPACT and the OSCAR{ 3 code system, to quantify the influence of impurities that were originally present in the fresh <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector,</b> the <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> poisoning phenomenon, and further goes on to propose the reflector's replacement criteria based on the calculated fluence and predicted swelling. Comparisons to experimental low power flux measurements and effects of safety parameters are also established. The study concludes that, to improve the accuracy and reliability of the predictive OSCAR code calculations, beryllium re flector burn–up should undoubtedly be incorporated in the next releases of OSCAR. Based on this study, the inclusion of the <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> burn–up chains is planned for implementation in the currently tested OSCAR– 4 code system. In addition to <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector</b> poisoning, the replacement criteria of the reflector is developed. It is however crucial that experimental measurements on the contents of 3 H and 4 He be conducted and thus swelling of the reflector be quantifed. In this way the calculated results could be verified and a sound replacement criteria be developed. In the absence of experimental measurements on the <b>beryllium</b> <b>reflector,</b> the analysis and quantifcation of the calculated results is reserved for future studies. Master...|$|E
