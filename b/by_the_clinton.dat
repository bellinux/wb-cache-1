5|$|In 1997, McCain became {{chairman}} of the powerful Senate Commerce Committee; he was criticized for accepting funds from corporations and businesses under the committee's purview, but in response said the small contributions he received {{were not part of}} the big-money nature of the campaign finance problem. McCain took on the tobacco industry in 1998, proposing legislation that would increase cigarette taxes in order to fund anti-smoking campaigns, discourage teenage smokers, increase money for health research studies, and help states pay for smoking-related health care costs. Supported <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration but opposed by the industry and most Republicans, the bill failed to gain cloture.|$|E
5|$|The Romney Literary Society's {{last meeting}} {{was held at}} Literary Hall in 1886. From that point to 1973 the {{building}} {{was used as a}} meeting space <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Lodge of Ancient Free and Accepted Masons and the Order of the Eastern Star. In 1973, the building was purchased by prominent Romney lawyer Ralph Haines, who used it as a law office and museum. From 1937 to the early 1940s the building also housed a community library. Literary Hall was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 29, 1979.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, the {{boundaries}} of the Clause were further defined when Senator William S. Kenyon was allowed to accept an appointment by President Warren G. Harding as circuit judge for the Eighth Circuit. Attorney General Harry M. Daugherty concluded that no disqualifying event had occurred because the increase in emoluments to that office had occurred in a term prior to the one Kenyon was serving {{at the time of the}} nomination. (Daugherty's opinion would later be reaffirmed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration when Representative Bill Richardson was nominated as U.N. Ambassador.) No rollback was attempted when Senator Hugo Black was appointed to the Supreme Court, and in Ex parte Levitt, the court rejected, for lack of legal standing, an attempt to prevent Black from taking his seat based on Ineligibility Clause objections. The movant in the Black case, Albert Levitt, only had an interest in the case as a United States Citizen and a member of the Supreme Court bar, which the Court found to be insufficient.|$|E

5|$|Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton {{created the}} William J. Clinton Foundation {{to address issues}} of global importance. This {{foundation}} includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat that disease, and {{has worked with the}} Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict. In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30percent in developing nations.

25|$|Instead of uniting {{behind the}} {{original}} proposal, many Democrats offered {{a number of}} competing plans of their own. Hillary Clinton was drafted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> Administration to head a new Task Force and sell the plan to the American people, which ultimately backfired amid the barrage from the pharmaceutical and health insurance industries and considerably diminished her own popularity. On September 26, 1994, the final compromise Democratic bill was declared dead by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell.|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Eichenwald {{began writing}} about {{assorted}} corporate misdeeds.

25|$|Gunboat {{diplomacy}} in the post-Cold War {{world is}} still {{largely based on}} naval forces, owing to the U.S. Navy's overwhelming sea power. U.S. administrations have frequently changed the disposition of their major naval fleets to influence opinion in foreign capitals. More urgent diplomatic points were made <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration in the Yugoslav wars of the 1990s (in alliance with the United Kingdom's Blair government) and elsewhere, using sea-launched Tomahawk missiles, and E-3 AWACS airborne surveillance aircraft in a more passive display of military presence.|$|E
5000|$|Clark {{spent time}} during these {{early stages of}} the draft {{movement}} deciding whether to run, a decision he said was based heavily on deciding whether to expose his family to a presidential campaign. His wife, Gert, said she was [...] "initially ... not delighted about it", but later changed her mind after hearing their son Wesley Clark, Jr. say that [...] "things have to change, and we're willing to do it. And I want my son to grow up in a different world." [...] Clark went on Meet the Press in June 2003 and said he was [...] "seriously considering" [...] running for president. Clark believes Bill Clinton encouraged him to run when he attended a party hosted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons,</b> and Clinton toasted his wife Hillary and Clark as the two [...] "stars" [...] of the Democratic Party. Clark's repeated connections with Bill Clinton led pundits to speculate that Clark was being maneuvered <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clintons</b> to change <b>the</b> Democratic field and clear a path for Hillary to enter the race. This theory lasted only a few months, and Antonia Felix speculated in her biography of Clark that it came from the largely unexplained connection between Clark and Bill Clinton that led to speculation.|$|R

In 2003, Smith worked to extend it to 2005. He took action {{when he heard}} about Ukrainian girls being held against their will in brothels in Montenegro. He called the Montenegrin prime minister, who ordered a raid on the operation. He has worked to secure grant funding for Project Polaris, a New York-New Jersey group combating sex trafficking.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1993 Aspin began to tell the White House that the five-year Defense budget, {{reflecting}} {{the results of the}} bottom-up review, would exceed the more than $1 trillion projected <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clinton</b> administration. In December 1993 he put the anticipated shortfall at no less than $50 billion, the consequence of inaccurate inflation estimates, a military pay raise, and failure to account for other Pentagon costs, including peacekeeping operations. The size of the force needed to meet the two regional wars scenario contributed to the projected budget shortfall. Furthermore, Aspin was on record as favoring the use of U.S. troops in regional conflicts, as opposed to other decisionmakers, including General Colin Powell, chairman of the JCS. Aspin's departure from office early in 1994 left further decisions on the Defense budget to his successor. The final FY 1994 budget amounted to a little under $252 billion in total obligational authority.|$|E
25|$|Shortly before 10 a.m. on June 25, 1996, {{members of}} a {{terrorist}} group detonated a truck bomb outside building 131 (also known as Khobar Towers) of the King Abdul Aziz Air Base. Inside the building were almost exclusively members of the US Air Force who were there to patrol the southern Iraqi no-fly zone enacted after the Gulf War. In the attack, 19 US military personnel and a Saudi local were killed and 372 were wounded, making this the most deadly terrorist attack on Americans abroad since the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing. Louis Freeh said in his book My FBI that he felt the deepest about the Khobar Towers investigation, {{and it was not}} until his last day in office, June 21, 2001, a federal grand jury in Alexandria, Virginia returned a 46-count indictment against 14 defendants charged with the Khobar Towers attack.
