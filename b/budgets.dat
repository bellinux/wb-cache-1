40|$|Many {{emerging}} market economies {{are trying to}} improve their <b>budget</b> processes and move to performance-based <b>budgeting.</b> This paper first reviews {{the evolution of the}} "new" performance <b>budgeting</b> model, increasingly being applied in industrial countries. By identifying its main components, the tasks faced by {{emerging market}} economies when converting their present <b>budget</b> systems to this model are determined. It is recognized that this conversion will not be easy and will require four major reform elements. First, any existing program structure must be set in the wider context of strategic <b>budget</b> planning and medium-term <b>budget</b> frameworks. Second, this typically involves redesigning and refining existing program structures. Third, existing budget-costing systems and associated skills will probably need to be improved. Fourth, and perhaps most difficult, a new system of accountability and <b>budget</b> incentives needs to be introduced. For emerging market economies, these should be viewed as the prerequisites for a successful introduction of the new performance-budgeting model.

Given that the former Yugoslav republics all commenced the reform process with the same institutions, this paper offers a unique opportunity to analyze the critical elements in successful <b>budget</b> system reform.

40|$|The <b>budget</b> is an {{expression}} of political rather than economic priorities. We confirm this proposition for a group of new and potential members of the European Union, finding that politics dominates. The contemporary practice of democracy can increase <b>budget</b> deficits through not only ideological preferences but also more fragmented government coalitions and higher voter participation. Long-term structural forces, triggered by societal divisions and representative electoral rules, have more ambiguous implications but also appear to increase <b>budget</b> pressures, as others have also found. However, our most robust, and hopeful, finding is that <b>budget</b> institutions-mechanisms and rules of the <b>budget</b> process-that create checks and balances have significant value even when the politics is representative but undisciplined, and when long-term structural forces are unfavorable.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the findings of}} fiscal transparency reports on standards and codes (ROSCs) for most EU accession candidate countries. Emphasis {{is given to the}} need to establish effective and accountable medium-term <b>budget</b> frameworks to establish policy credibility and anchor adjustment programs to meet EU fiscal goals. Adoption of <b>budgeting</b> and accounting standards consistent with the IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 framework will also help link <b>budget</b> decisions to EU standards of fiscal reporting. More consistent and comprehensive coverage of off-budget activities is needed for assessing fiscal risk and sustainability. Finally, local government issues need to be addressed by many of these countries since EU fiscal goals are set with reference to general government. Progress in all of these areas can be monitored by keeping fiscal ROSC assessments up to date.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{issues relating}} to the establishment and financial management of extrabudgetary funds (EBFs), {{a large group of}} government entities that on average accounts for 40 to 45 percent of central government expenditure-two-thirds of which represents social security funds-in countries at various stages of development. If improperly designed and managed, EBFs can undermine effective fiscal control. However, they also bring potential benefits in the form of greater autonomy of decision-making in countries with well-established governance and financial management systems that have applied the "agency model" of devolved public management and fiscal control. The paper develops a typology of EBFs and argues that EBFs are frequently created because of failures in the <b>budget</b> system and political economy factors that need to be recognized and, where possible, corrected. The paper recommends that data on EBFs be consolidated within a unified system of fiscal reporting and proposes an analytical framework that governments might use to evaluate the effectiveness and utility of their EBFs.

5|$|The {{ecology of}} global carbon <b>budgets</b> gives {{one example of}} the linkage between {{biodiversity}} and biogeochemistry. It is estimated that the Earth's oceans hold 40,000 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, that vegetation and soil hold 2070 Gt, and that fossil fuel emissions are 6.3 Gt carbon per year. There have been major restructurings in these global carbon <b>budgets</b> during the Earth's history, regulated to a large extent by the ecology of the land. For example, through the early-mid Eocene volcanic outgassing, the oxidation of methane stored in wetlands, and seafloor gases increased atmospheric CO2 (carbon dioxide) concentrations to levels as high as 3500ppm.|$|E
