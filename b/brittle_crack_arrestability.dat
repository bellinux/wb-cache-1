Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} potential crack propagation along welds using large heat input. This paper examines the application of a T-joint to the strength deck structure of container ships to enhance crack arrestability. The crack arrest toughness, Kca, for crack arrest was varied. The ESSO test of T-joint components showed that brittle crack was arrested at the T-joint if the steel plate used for the flange had a high Kca value in the range from 4900 to 7300 N/mm 3 / 2. FE-analysis of the stress intensity factor K indicated that brittle crack propagation was arrested under the condition that the K-value at the running crack tip was less than the Kca of the material. In the T-joint, it was noted that the K-value around the area of the deepest point of the crack decreased and was finally less than the Kca of the flange plate when the brittle crack penetrated suddenly into the flange plate to a 10 mm depth. This phenomenon shows the advantage of using a T-joint for brittle crack arrest in the flange plates of strength deck structures...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo prevent <b>brittle</b> <b>cracks</b> from causing fatal {{damage to}} steel structures, {{it is needed}} that steels have enough <b>crack</b> <b>arrestability.</b> However, the <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation/arrest {{behavior}} has not been explained theoretically enough from the aspect of energy balance and especially the long crack problem has remained as an important unsolved issue for some decades. The authors propose a new model based on local fracture stress criterion to solve the long crack problem. The model considers crack closure effect by uncracked side ligaments formed due to relaxation of plastic constraint progressing with SIF increasing. A simultaneous equation composed of four equations, which formulate local fracture condition, strain hardening, yield point, and dynamic SIF considering side ligaments, is solved to simulate a crack propagation in the model. To validate the model, we compared model simulations with some experiments. Some of them were conducted under the long crack problem condition and obtained the result that they showed good agreements, even under the long crack problem condition. This implies the long crack problem can be explained from the aspect of side ligament development due to the relaxation of plastic constraint...|$|R
40|$|Crack {{arrest of}} fast running cracks is an {{important}} issue for the safety of steel structures. Crack arrest design can prevent fatal damage of large structures by restricting the influence of the incidents. Therefore crack arrest design is important especially for very large structure, where accidents may cause huge economical and social losses. Propagating shear fracture, long running ductile crack propagation in pipelines and <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in heavy thick shipbuilding steels have been investigated. For the propagating shear fracture issue, a new HLP simulation model, applicable to various backfill conditions, including underwater backfill, was developed. The proposed backfill model {{can be applied to the}} prediction of the crack arrest of propagating shear fracture under various backfill conditions. The new HLP simulation was successful in estimating full-scale burst tests with various backfill depths. The new HLP simulation for underwater pipelines indicated that propagating shear cracks are easily arrested in offshore pipelines compared to onshore pipeline. The toughness requirement of the line pipe for preventing propagating shear fracture can be significantly smaller in underwater pipelines compared to onshore pipelines. The margin of the underwater pipeline for propagating shear fracture was clarified by the new model developed in this thesis. For <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> arrest, an empirical approach for long crack propagation has been conducted. Several large-scale crack arrest tests were carried out in order to investigate the long <b>crack</b> <b>arrestability</b> of heavy-thick shipbuilding steel plates. All plates and their welded joints used in this study satisfied the Charpy toughness requirement for EH-grade shipbuilding steels and welded joints. A <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> ran along a welded joint and penetrated through the test plate under a stress exceeding 200 MPa, despite the presence of longitudinal stiffeners across the test weld. A <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> in a base plate model test with longitudinal stiffeners propagated through the specimen under the maximum design stress. These results suggest that EH-grade cannot ensure arrestability even in the base plate, in case of heavy thick shipbuilding steel. Two crack arrest tests were conducted in order to demonstrate the possibility of long crack arrest using high arrestability steels. The test results indicated that the crack arrest concept could be achieved by a combination of high arrest toughness materials and a special fabrication method which can derive a <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> into the base plate of high <b>arrestability</b> plate. The <b>crack</b> arrest design can be used in practice even for large-scale structures using heavy thick steel plates. The effective K concept, as proposed by Machida, et al. 31), provides the boundary of the “arrest” and “propagate” data in the large-scale tests conducted in this work. The effective K concept was found to be valid even for long crack propagation of such a heavy thick steel plate as investigated in this paper.

40|$|AbstractThe authors {{measured}} the local fracture stress of <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in steel plates. Many studies on <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in steel plates {{have been implemented}} based on energy balance, {{but they have not}} been able to provide full theoretical explanation to <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation and arrest behavior in steel plates. On the other hand, although the local fracture stress concept has been emerging as a factor governing the behavior recently, the local fracture stress has not been evaluated sufficiently because the crack front shape and forming of shear lip have prevent us from implementing accurate FEM analysis of <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation. So, we implemented <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation tests using specimen with side groove which is designed to increase stress near the plate surface and make the crack front straight. Inputting crack velocities obtained from experiments, FEM analyses were implemented. Our analyses showed the local fracture stress is higher in low temperature than in high temperature.

40|$|AbstractBrittle {{fracture}} in carbon steel affects serious impact {{for the safety}} of fracture of in steel. Especially, the arresting technology of crack propagation is the last stand for the structure. It is so important issue that the conditions which can be stopped reliably crack propagation should be clarified thoroughly. On the background of such social importance, lots of experimental and theoretical researches have been conducted from both mechanical and microstructural viewpoints. Though {{it has been reported that}} the limit speed of <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation is the Rayleigh wave speed and the speed is about 2, 900 m/s in steels, the real speed of <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation in steels is about 1, 000 m/s and lower. The reason for that is considered braking effects with crack propagation, for example unevenness in the facet, tear ridge, microcrack, twin deformation and side ligament, namely the elements that dominate the arresting toughness. In this study, the 3 % silicon steel where microstructure is ferrite single phase and its grain size is 4 - 5 mm of very large is used. It is assumed that the <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation speed in single crystal grain is very fast because there is no need to consider tear ridge between crystal grains. In this experiment, it is succeeded in shooting of brittle fracture of steel by high speed camera. As a result of that, it was revealed that the <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> propagation rate of 3 % silicon steel is much lower than ordinary carbon steel. Also, twin deformation and unevenness in the facet are observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM) ...|$|R

40|$|Stress {{enhancement}} in {{the vicinity}} of <b>brittle</b> <b>cracks</b> makes the macroscale failure properties extremely sensitive to the microscale material disorder. As a result, crack propagation is sometimes observed to display a jerky dynamics with seemingly random sudden jumps spanning a broad range of scales, reminiscent of earthquakes. This so-called crackling dynamics cannot be captured via standard continuum fracture theory. The understandings of the key processes that drive such a dynamics then represent a crucial step toward predictive statistical models for heterogeneous brittle failure. In this context, we designed an experimental setup which permits to drive <b>brittle</b> <b>cracks</b> in opening mode at adjustable velocity throughout model materials of adjustable microstructure. During the fracture, both the mechanical behavior and the acoustic emission are recorded in real time, and post-mortem, the morphology of the fracture surface is obtained by profilometry.

5000|$|Rankine {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{engineers}} to recognise that fatigue failures of railway axles was caused by the initiation and growth of <b>brittle</b> <b>cracks.</b> In the early 1840s he examined many broken axles, especially after the Versailles train crash of 1842 when a locomotive axle suddenly fractured and led to the death of over 50 passengers. He showed that the axles had failed by progressive growth of a <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> from a shoulder or other stress concentration source on the shaft, such as a keyway. He was supported by similar direct analysis of failed axles by Joseph Glynn, where the axles failed by slow growth of a <b>brittle</b> <b>crack</b> in a process now known as metal fatigue. It was likely that the front axle of one of the locomotives involved in the Versailles train crash failed in a similar way. Rankine presented his conclusions in a paper delivered to the Institution of Civil Engineers. His work was ignored however, by many engineers who persisted in believing that stress could cause [...] "re-crystallisation" [...] of the metal, a myth which has persisted even to recent times. The theory of recrystallisation was quite wrong, and inhibited worthwhile research until the work of William Fairbairn a few years later, which showed the weakening effect of repeated flexure on large beams. Nevertheless, fatigue remained a serious and poorly understood phenomenon, and was the root cause of many accidents on the railways and elsewhere. It is still a serious problem, but at least is much better understood today, and so can be prevented by careful design.|$|R

The study of heat source fields combined with micrographic observations allowed to define the matrix micro-cracking as the predominant damage phenomenon in crack tip.
