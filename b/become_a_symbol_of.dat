5|$|Both {{ancient and}} modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae {{as an example of}} the power of a {{patriotic}} army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used {{as an example of the}} advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers and has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> courage against overwhelming odds.|$|E
5|$|Maria Limanskaya (also mistakenly {{referred}} to as Anna Pavlova) was a female soldier of the Red Army for three years during World War II.

5|$|Bus {{transport}} {{across the}} country is widespread; major companies include National Express, Arriva and Go-Ahead Group. The red double-decker buses in London have <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> England. There is a rapid transit network in two English cities: the London Underground; and the Tyne and Wear Metro in Newcastle, Gateshead and Sunderland. There are several tram networks, such as the Blackpool tramway, Manchester Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram and Midland Metro, and the Tramlink system centred on Croydon in South London.|$|E
5|$|Cal Poly Pomona's {{dominant}} landmark is a futurist-styled administrative facility {{known as}} the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993. The building’s peculiar shape (standing out by a triangular-shaped “skyroom” atop its eight-story tower) has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> the university; in addition, its close location to film studios based in the Hollywood borough of Los Angeles have prompted its inclusion in motion pictures such as Gattaca and Impostor. In 2013, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to demolish the building {{and replace it with}} a new academic/faculty complex because of severe seismic risks.|$|E
5|$|Leaving the United States Army a {{few years}} before it was integrated, Matthews then {{took a job as a}} {{security}} guard in Maryland, rising to the rank of chief of the guards and then retiring in 1970. After the war, he told stories of military experiences and grew to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> the Buffalo Soldiers. He met with Bill Clinton and Colin Powell in his later years, and dedicated a barracks in Virginia in honor of the Buffalo Soldiers. Having experienced excellent health for most of his life, Matthews died of pneumonia at the age of 111 and was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. At the time of his death, he was recognized as the oldest living Buffalo Soldier as well as the oldest man, and the second-oldest person, in the District of Columbia.|$|E

5|$|The temple is a {{powerful}} symbol of Cambodia, and {{is a source of}} great national pride that has factored into Cambodia's diplomatic relations with France, the United States and its neighbour Thailand. A depiction of Angkor Wat {{has been a part of}} Cambodian national flags since the introduction of the first version circa 1863. From a larger historical and even transcultural perspective, however, the temple of Angkor Wat did not <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> national pride sui generis but had been inscribed into a larger politico-cultural process of French-colonial heritage production in which the original temple site was presented in French colonial and universal exhibitions in Paris and Marseille between 1889 and 1937. Angkor Wat's aesthetics were also on display in the plaster cast museum of Louis Delaporte called musée Indo-chinois which existed in the Parisian Trocadero Palace from c.1880 to the mid-1920s.|$|E
5|$|Towering {{over the}} Rhine valley, the Godesburg's {{strategic}} position commanded the roads leading {{to and from}} Bonn, the Elector of Cologne's capital city, and Cologne, the region's economic powerhouse. Over time, the Electors strengthened its walls and heightened its towers. They added a small residence in the 14th century and the donjon (also called a Bergfried or keep) developed as a stronghold of the Electoral archives and valuables. By the mid-16th century, the Godesburg was considered nearly impregnable and had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> the dual power of the Prince-electors and Archbishops of Cologne, {{one of the wealthiest}} ecclesiastical territories in the Holy Roman Empire. The Cologne War, a feud between the Protestant Elector, Gebhard, Truchsess of Waldburg, and the Catholic Elector, Ernst of Bavaria, was yet another schismatic episode in the Electoral and archdiocesan history.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the War of 1812, as the British post in Florida was {{evacuated}} the Corps' Florida detachment {{was paid}} off and disbanded. Although several men accompanied the British to Bermuda, the majority continued to live in settlements around the wooden stockade the Corps had garrisoned (which had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> slave insurrection). This legacy of a community of armed fugitive slaves with a substantial arsenal would lead to tensions with the United States of America. Those remaining later took part in the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816, after which they joined the southward migration of Seminoles and African Americans escaping the American advance. Members of the Colonial Marine battalion who were deployed on the Atlantic coast withdrew from American territory. They would continue in British service as garrison-in-residence at Bermuda until 1816, when the unit was disbanded and the ex-Marines resettled on Trinidad.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to Italian, {{the majority of}} the population speak fluent Ampezzano, a local variant of Ladin, now recognized as a language rather than a dialect. Ladin comes from Latin (like Italian, French and Spanish) and resembles Romansh which is spoken in Switzerland. Maintaining the local language, that is not only spoken by the older people but also by many of Cortina's younger inhabitants, has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> their attachment to the local mountainous heritage. The community is also proud of its Ladin or Tyrolean culture, that continues to survive despite the increasing pressure it has faced in recent years. Its importance is even beginning to be recognized by the local authorities who in December 2007 decided to use Ladin on signs for the names of streets and villages, in compliance with regulations for the protection of linguistic minorities in force since 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{detachment}} in Florida, {{which had}} grown to about 400 men, was paid off and disbanded when the British post was evacuated {{at the end of}} the war. A small number of men went to Bermuda with the British as part of a refugee group, rejoining the main body of Colonial Marines. Others from the Florida unit remained in settlements around the wooden stockade, which had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> slave insurrection. Andrew Jackson opposed the presence of a group of armed fugitive slaves (although they were in a sparsely-populated area of Spanish Florida); this led to the Battle of Negro Fort in July 1816 and the beginning of the First Seminole War. For their involvement in the conflict, two former auxiliary officers of the corps were executed in 1818 in what became known as the Arbuthnot and Ambrister incident. It is believed that former Colonial Marine refugees were among a group that escaped to the Bahamas in 1822 and founded, on the west coast of the island of Andros, a community that retains its identity to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí's main {{new project}} at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century was the Park Güell (1900–1914), commissioned by Eusebi Güell. It was intended to be a residential estate in the style of an English garden city. The project was unsuccessful: of the 60 plots into which the site was divided only one was sold. Despite this, the park entrances and service areas were built, displaying Gaudí's genius and putting into practice many of his innovative structural solutions. The Park Güell is situated in Barcelona's Càrmel district, a rugged area, with steep slopes that Gaudí negotiated with a system of viaducts integrated into the terrain. The main entrance to the park has a building on each side, intended as a porter's lodge and an office, and the site is surrounded by a stone and glazed-ceramic wall. These entrance buildings are an example of Gaudí at the height of his powers, with Catalan vaults that form a parabolic hyperboloid. After passing through the gate, steps lead to higher levels, decorated with sculpted fountains, notably the dragon fountain, which has <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> the park and one of Gaudí's most recognised emblems. These steps lead to the Hypostyle Hall, which was to have been the residents' market, constructed with large Doric columns. Above this chamber is a large plaza in the form of a Greek theatre, with the famous undulating bench covered in broken ceramics ("trencadís"), the work of Josep Maria Jujol. The park's show home, the work of Francesc Berenguer, was Gaudí's residence from 1906 to 1926, and currently houses the Casa-Museu Gaudí.|$|E

5|$|In 743, {{after the}} death of Caliph Hisham, Walid II {{reconfirmed}} Nasr in his post, but the influential governor of Iraq, Yusuf ibn Umar al-Thaqafi, an opponent of Nasr, tried to lure him away from his province by calling him to Iraq. Nasr delayed his departure, stalling for time, and was saved by the murder of Walid in April 744. However, Walid's successor, Yazid III, moved to install a regime dominated by the Yemeni Kalbi tribe. Nasr's position was severely undermined, and the Yemeni faction now hoped to see their leader Juday' al-Kirmani appointed governor in his stead. Indeed, Yazid appointed his favourite, the Kalbi Mansur ibn Jumhur, as governor of Iraq, and he in turn nominated his own brother as Nasr's replacement. Nasr refused to accept this, and was again fortunate in his persistence, for Mansur fell out of favour and was dismissed after only two months. Agitation among the Yemeni faction persisted, amidst rumours that Nasr had intercepted letters appointing al-Kirmani as governor, and a dispute on the payment of stipends to the muqatila. Nasr tried to secure his own position by deposing al-Kirmani from his leadership of the Azd, as well as by trying to win over Azd and Rabi'ah leaders. This led to a general uprising by the Azd and Rabi'ah under al-Kirmani. It is indicative of the lingering intertribal antagonism of the late Umayyad world that the rebellion was launched in the name of revenge for the Muhallabids, an Azd family that had been purged after rebelling in 720, an act which had since <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> Yemeni resentment of the Umayyads and their northern Arab-dominated regime.|$|E
5|$|Kenyatta's {{imprisonment}} transformed {{him into}} a political martyr for many Kenyans, further enhancing his status. A Luo anti-colonial activist, Jaramogi Oginga Odinga, {{was the first to}} publicly call for Kenyatta's release, an issue that gained growing support among Kenya's anti-colonialists. In 1955, the British writer Montagu Slater—a socialist sympathetic to Kenyatta's plight—released The Trial of Jomo Kenyatta, a book which raised the profile of the case. By the late 1950s, the imprisoned Kenyatta had <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> African nationalism across the continent. Calls for his release were being made outside Kenya: resolutions to that effect were produced at the All-African Peoples' Conferences held in Tunis in 1960 and Cairo in 1961. Tanganyikan President Julius Nyerere also did so. Activists in the Kenyan Asian community also backed him, with the Kenya Indian Congress calling for his release. In April 1959, Kenyatta was released from Lokitaung. The administration then placed a restricting order on Kenyatta, forcing him to reside in the remote area of Lodwar, where he had to report to the district commissioner twice a day. There, he was joined by his wife Ngina. In October 1961 she bore him another son, Uhuru, and later on another daughter, Nyokabi, and a further son, Muhoho. Kenyatta spent two years in Lodwar.|$|E
5|$|Pro-slavery advocates {{claimed that}} enslaved Africans were lesser {{human beings who}} benefited from their bondage. Wilberforce, the Clapham Sect and others were anxious to {{demonstrate}} that Africans, and particularly freed slaves, had human and economic abilities beyond the slave trade, {{and that they were}} capable of sustaining a well-ordered society, trade and cultivation. Inspired in part by the utopian vision of Granville Sharp, they became involved in the establishment in 1792 of a free colony in Sierra Leone with black settlers from the United Kingdom, Nova Scotia and Jamaica, as well as native Africans and some whites. They formed the Sierra Leone Company, with Wilberforce subscribing liberally to the project in money and time. The dream was of an ideal society in which races would mix on equal terms; the reality was fraught with tension, crop failures, disease, death, war and defections to the slave trade. Initially a commercial venture, the British government assumed responsibility for the colony in 1808. The colony, although troubled at times, was to <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>of</b> anti-slavery in which residents, communities and African tribal chiefs, worked together to prevent enslavement at the source, supported by a British naval blockade to stem the region's slave trade.|$|E
