The charges were eventually dropped and Daniels pleaded guilty to [...] "a disorderly person charge" [...] based on a confession that he had used marijuana. He spent two nights in jail and paid a $350 fine. According to Daniels' roommate at the time, police obtained a warrant to search the room based on the activity of another student who {{used to live in}} the room.

500|$|The Bears {{travelled}} to Heinz Field to {{face the}} winless Pittsburgh Steelers in their first NBC Sunday Night Football matchup of the season. Pittsburgh had lost the previous week to Cincinnati to fall to 0–2 {{for the first time}} in 11 years. In the last game between the two in 2009, the Bears triumphed 17–14. The Bears were the 1-point favorites; eight CBSSports.com experts voted on their predictions for the game, with a 5–3 result favoring Chicago, while four ESPN analysts predicted that the Steelers would win. One of the goals of the defense was to contain Ben Roethlisberger in the passing pocket, especially as the offensive line suffered the loss of center Maurkice Pouncey. Additionally, the Steelers also had the 31st-ranked rushing offense and had yet to score a rushing touchdown, who was expected to regain first-rounder Le'Veon Bell. Alan Rubenstein of ChicagoNow writes that the Bears should attempt to improve their pass rush, which was only able to record two sacks in the last two games. Marc Trestman cited the weather as a factor for the poor performance, stating, [...] "It’s tough to rush the passer in wet weather... For both sides. It’s tough to get a pass rush with a soggy field and a wet field. It’s an advantage throwing the football. On a rainy day (versus) no rain, really the advantage goes to the offense. Because we can sit <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> protect. And it’s really hard to configure a pass rush to get close." [...] On offense, the Bears should attempt to attack the Steelers' 14th-ranked rush defense. A key matchup was the WR-CB duel between Brandon Marshall and Ike Taylor; Taylor contained Bengals receiver A. J. Green, who recorded 162 yards against the Bears in week one, to just six catches for 41 yards in week two.|$|E

2500|$|Ament was {{subsequently}} released {{at the direction}} of the German military commander, Count Alfred von Waldersee. Wilbur Chamberlin, a reporter for the New York Sun, sent to China, reported in a letter dated 9 February 1901 to his wife:My missionary friend, the Rev. A., is out of limbo....Quite a long time ago he had a scheme for collecting damages for all his native Christians and his church from the Chinese themselves. He went around to some forty villages and collected 80,000 taels. A few days ago he went <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> was promptly arrested at the instigation of some Roman Catholics. It appears they had the same sort of scheme, but A. got there first, and when they went around to these same villages to make their collections, they found out that he had all the money there was. Naturally, they were enraged, so they made complaint against A., and declared that he had been blackmailing the villages....I really think, myself, that A. might have left a little for the Catholics. I don't like to see a man take it all, even if he is a missionary." [...] Chamberlin indicated that the French and Germans, under pressure from the Americans, released him, insisting that he was never under arrest.|$|E
2500|$|Loßberg made a swift {{reconnaissance}} of the 6th Army area, as the British were attacking Bullecourt at {{the north}} end of the [...] (Hindenburg line). He confirmed the decision made to withdraw from the Wancourt salient and the foot of Vimy Ridge, accepting that a rigid forward defence was impossible given British observation from the ridge. North of the Scarpe, the front garrison was given permission to withdraw during British attacks, from the battle zone to its rear edge, where it would counter-attack with the reserves held <b>back</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> mingle with retreating British infantry, to evade British observed artillery fire; after dark the German infantry would be redeployed in depth under cover. South of the Scarpe, the loss of Monchy-le-Preux also gave the British observation over German positions. Loßberg mapped a new line beyond the range of British field artillery, to be the back of a new battle zone (the [...] ). At the front of the battle zone he chose the old third line from Méricourt to Oppy, then a new line along reverse slopes from Oppy to the Hindenburg Position at Moulin-sans-Souci, creating a battle zone [...] deep.

I think everyone was quite wary because it's quite an odd thing to do to have attended his real funeral and then go back to film it all over again.
