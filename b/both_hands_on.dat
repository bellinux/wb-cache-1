The paddle shifters have two distinct advantages: the driver can safely keep <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the steering wheel when using the Manual/tiptronic mode; and the driver can temporarily manually override either of the automatic programmes (D or S), and gain instant manual control of the DSG transmission (within the above described constraints).|$|E
25|$|Skiffing {{refers to}} the {{sporting}} and leisure activity of rowing (or more correctly sculling) a Thames skiff. A Thames skiff is a traditional hand built clinker-built wooden craft of a design which has been seen on the River Thames and other waterways in England and other countries for nearly 200 years. Sculling means propelling the boat {{with a pair of}} oars (blades) as opposed to rowing which requires <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> a single oar.|$|E
25|$|The lead jammer {{can stop}} the jam at any time by {{repeatedly}} placing <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> their hips. If the jam is not stopped early, it ends after two minutes. If time remains in the period, teams then have 30 seconds {{to get on the}} track and line up for the next jam. Team members typically rotate between jams from the 14 players on the team's roster. Designations may change between jams: a pivot in one jam might be the jammer in a later jam.|$|E

25|$|A {{workbench}} is a table used by woodworkers to hold workpieces {{while they}} are worked by other tools. There are many styles of woodworking benches, each reflecting the type {{of work to be}} done or the craftsman's way of working. Most benches have two features in common: they are heavy and rigid enough to keep still while the wood is being worked, and there is some method for holding the work in place at a comfortable position and height so that the worker is free to use <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the tools. The main thing that distinguishes benches is the way in which the work is held in place. Most benches have more than one way to do this, depending on the operation being performed.|$|E
25|$|Today, in the Samoa 'ava ceremony, {{the role}} of the aumaga is a {{comprehensive}} term, but in former times the 'ava makers were a much more select guild. In the preparation of the 'ava for a ceremony the services of a young woman or young man, or one or more young ladies and young men may be utilised. It is customary for the daughters of all chiefs to be taught how to prepare the 'ava. If the person mixing the 'ava is a young woman, it is customary for her to be the virgin daughter of a chief (matai). The 'ava mixer, sits behind the tanoa bowl and thoroughly mixes the 'ava as another member of the aumaga adds water from time to time. As the mixing proceeds, the 'ava mixer from time to time wrings the liquid from the strainer and folding the same into half its usual length passes it to another member of the aumaga standing outside or {{near the edge of the}} house who frees the strainer of the woody particles of the 'ava by several violent flicks. He then quickly passes the strainer back to the mixer who proceeds until all the particles of the dried root are removed. The stylised movements and serious concentration in the making of the 'ava are part of the ritual pattern in the ceremony. The water poured into the bowl as the mixing proceeds is done from either the left or right, not from in front. The action of mixing is one of contracting and expanding the fingers of the two hands as the strainer is slowly worked towards the mixer. When the mixing is completed the rim of the bowl is wiped to remove any water or woody material and the strainer is folded up and placed on the rim of the bowl. The mixer then places <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the bowl and sits quietly awaiting the next move in the ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Gunroar is a naval themed shoot 'em up {{likened to}} a {{vertically}} scrolling version of Geometry Wars (or {{a cross between}} Asteroids and Space Invaders). The player controls a small, abstract gunboat which can be rotated through 360 degrees as in games such as Geometry Wars and Robotron. The game also features vertical scrolling; however, unlike the standard shoot 'em up in which the propulsion of the craft dictates the pace, players can control {{the speed at which}} they proceed through the level. The faster players move through a level, the more points they will score. The game features multiple modes dependent on how the game is controlled: the player can choose to control a single boat by means of the keyboard or mouse or a more complicated [...] "dual" [...] mode allowing the use of two boats using <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the keyboard. Gunroar was praised for its minimalist design, impressive polygonal graphics, and frenetic action.|$|E

500|$|The oldest {{stand at}} Anfield is the Main Stand, taking 76 years to complete. The stand was {{completed}} in 2016, however, the lower section dates from 1906. The bottom tier of the stand houses the directors' box. The directors' VIP box {{is located at the}} rear of the lower tier of the stand. The old large roof was supported by two thin central uprights, with a large suspended television camera gantry which has moved to the front of the third tier [...] The players' tunnel and the technical area where the managers and substitutes sit during the match are in the middle of the stand at pitch level. Above the stairs leading down to the pitch hung a sign stating [...] "THIS IS ANFIELD". Its purpose was to both intimidate the opposition and to bring the Liverpool players who touch it good luck. Accordingly, Liverpool players and coaching staff traditionally reached up and placed one or <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> it as they passed underneath.|$|E

2500|$|Some transit buses, such {{as those}} in New York, have had, since at least the 1950s, turn signals {{activated}} by floor-mounted momentary-contact footswitches on the floor near the driver's left foot (on left-hand drive buses). The foot-activated signals allow bus drivers to keep <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the steering wheel while watching the road and scanning for passengers as they approach a bus stop. New York City Transit bus drivers, among others, are trained to step continuously on the right directional switch while servicing a bus stop, to signal other road users they are intentionally dwelling at the stop, allowing following buses to skip that stop. [...] This method of signalling requires no special arrangements for self-cancellation or passing.|$|E

2500|$|No precise {{date for}} the Vandor's first flight is known but {{contemporary}} references suggest {{it was in the}} spring of 1934. Its flight characteristics came in for continued criticism. [...] It was heavy, with an empty weight of [...] compared with the [...] of the Grunau Baby 2, caused partly by the need for extra strength to cope with the stresses of aerobatics. This made slow flight within thermals difficult, not helped by the choice of airfoil. There are no known contemporary reports of its aerobatic performance but the heavy ailerons were much criticised, one student reported that their operation required <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the control column. The sole example remained in use until at least 1939 but flying it was seen as a challenge for all but the very best students; it certainly failed to meet its original aim [...] of all-purpose intermediate trainer ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Penn State Blue Band {{has entered}} the field, and played the first 8 bars of [...] "Hail to the Lion," [...] the Blue Band's Drum Major does a high-stepping, stiff-legged sprint in between rows of band members from the goal line to the 50 yard line, where he does a front flip. Legend states that if the drum major lands the flip, the team will win that afternoon. He then {{performs}} another flip while running towards the end zone. After he stands back up, he and the Nittany Lion, who is holding his baton, take 5 high-steps toward each other, meeting 5 yards deep in the end zone. The Lion and Drum Major both place <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the baton in alternating order (in the same manner children choosing teams {{with a baseball bat}} would) and then throw the baton into the ground. They then salute each other, embrace arms, and then both excitedly run towards the student section, where they are cheered enthusiastically.|$|E
2500|$|Although the etymological {{origins of}} [...] "Wa" [...] remain uncertain, Chinese {{historical}} texts recorded an ancient people {{residing in the}} Japanese archipelago (perhaps Kyūshū), named something like *ʼWâ or *ʼWər 倭. Carr (1992:9–10) surveys prevalent proposals for Wa's etymology ranging from feasible (transcribing Japanese first-person pronouns waga 我が [...] "my; our" [...] and ware 我 [...] "I; oneself; thou") to shameful (writing Japanese Wa as 倭 implying [...] "dwarf"), and summarizes interpretations for *ʼWâ [...] "Japanese" [...] into variations on two etymologies: [...] "behaviorally 'submissive' or physically 'short'." [...] The first [...] "submissive; obedient" [...] explanation began with the (121 CE) Shuowen Jiezi dictionary. It defines 倭 as shùnmào 順皃 [...] "obedient/submissive/docile appearance", graphically explains the [...] "person; human" [...] radical 亻 with a wěi 委 [...] "bent" [...] phonetic, and quotes the above Shijing poem. [...] "Conceivably, when Chinese first met Japanese," [...] Carr (1992:9) suggests [...] "they transcribed Wa as *ʼWâ 'bent back' signifying 'compliant' bowing/obeisance. Bowing is noted in early historical references to Japan." [...] Examples include [...] "Respect is shown by squatting" [...] (Hou Han Shu, tr. Tsunoda 1951:2), and [...] "they either squat or kneel, with <b>both</b> <b>hands</b> <b>on</b> the ground. This {{is the way they}} show respect." [...] (Wei Zhi, tr. Tsunoda 1951:13). Koji Nakayama interprets wēi 逶 [...] "winding" [...] as [...] "very far away" [...] and euphemistically translates Wō 倭 as [...] "separated from the continent." [...] The second etymology of wō 倭 meaning [...] "dwarf, pygmy" [...] has possible cognates in ǎi 矮 [...] "low, short (of stature)", wō 踒 [...] "strain; sprain; bent legs", and wò 臥 [...] "lie down; crouch; sit (animals and birds)". Early Chinese dynastic histories refer to a Zhūrúguó 侏儒國 [...] "pygmy/dwarf country" [...] located south of Japan, associated with possibly Okinawa Island or the Ryukyu Islands. Carr cites the historical precedence of construing Wa as [...] "submissive people" [...] and the [...] "Country of Dwarfs" [...] legend as evidence that the [...] "little people" [...] etymology was a secondary development.|$|E
