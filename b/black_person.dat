5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people.

One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good <b>black</b> <b>person.</b> And it's a dirty, dark secret.

In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime.

40|$|Thesis (LL. M. (Estate Law)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006. The {{winding up}} of estates under Black law and custom have changed {{considerably}} since 6 December 2002. Different systems of {{administration of estates}} existed before then. The intestate estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons</b> were administered by the Magistrate, while the estates of all other race groups, including testate estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons,</b> were administered by the Master of the High Court. The administration of all intestate estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons</b> accrued under the Black Administration Act 38 of 1927 and the Regulations for the Administration and Distribution of the Estates of Deceased Blacks, GN R 200 of 1987 promulgated in terms thereof. All other estates were administered under the Administration of Estates Act 66 of 1965. Section 23 (7) (a) of the Black Administration Act 38 of 1927 excluded the Master's authority to administer intestate estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons.</b> This differentiation was pointed out in Moseneke v The Master 2001 SA 18 (CC). The Constitutional Court decided that any legislation that prefers different systems of administration on grounds of race should be declared unconstitutional. The Court, however, only changed the circumstances of estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons</b> that devolved under common law and these estates could then also be administered by the Master or the Magistrate. All intestate estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons</b> that devolved under customary law were still administered by the Magistrate with appropriate jurisdiction. On 5 December 2002, the Administration of Estates Amendment Act 47 of 2002 and the Amendment of the Regulations for the Administration and Distribution of Estates, GN R 1501 of 2002 were promulgated {{to give effect to}} the order of Moseneke v The Master 2001 SA 18 (CC). After these amendments, all estates with a value of less than R 50 000,OO were to be administered by the Magistrates, but under supervision of the Master. All other estates, excluding those that devolved under customary law, had to be reported to the Master. The intestate estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons</b> that had to devolve under customary law were still administered by the Magistrate. On 15 October 2004, the Constitutional Court ruled in Bhe v Magistrate, Khayelitsha (Commission for Gender Equality as Amicus Curiae); Shibi v Sithole; South African Human Rights Commission v President of the Republic of South Africa 2005 1 SA 580 (KH) that all discrimination and differentiation of the administration systems should stop. All estates, including intestate estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons</b> that must devolve under customary law, must be administered by the Master. This {{was the beginning of a}} unified system where all estates must be reported to the Master. All estates that were reported before 15 October 2004 had to be finalised in the way that they were reported. The South African Law Reform Commission currently is investigating the winding up and administration of estates. With their findings and the abovementioned legislation and case law, a unified system is sure to follow. Estate planners and executers need to take note of all the amendments that have taken place in the area of the intestate estates of <b>Black</b> <b>persons</b> during the past five years.

From 1957 to 1964, Robinson was {{the vice president}} for personnel at Chock full o'Nuts; he was the first <b>black</b> <b>person</b> to serve as vice president of a major American corporation. Robinson always considered his business career as advancing the cause of black people in commerce and industry. Robinson also chaired the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's (NAACP) million-dollar Freedom Fund Drive in 1957, and served on the organization's board until 1967. In 1964, he helped found, with Harlem businessman Dunbar McLaurin, Freedom National Bank—a black-owned and operated commercial bank based in Harlem. He also served as the bank's first chairman of the board. In 1970, Robinson established the Jackie Robinson Construction Company to build housing for low-income families.|$|E
5|$|Two calamities in {{the autumn}} of 1906 shocked African Americans, and they contributed to {{strengthening}} support for Du Bois's struggle for civil rights to prevail over Booker T. Washington's accommodationism. First, President Teddy Roosevelt dishonorably discharged 167 black soldiers because they were accused of crimes {{as a result of the}} Brownsville Affair. Many of the discharged soldiers had served for 20 years and were near retirement. Second, in September, riots broke out in Atlanta, precipitated by unfounded allegations of black men assaulting white women. This was a catalyst for racial tensions based on a job shortage and employers playing black workers against white workers. Ten thousand whites rampaged through Atlanta, beating every <b>black</b> <b>person</b> they could find, resulting in over 25 deaths. In the aftermath of the 1906 violence, Du Bois urged blacks to withdraw their support from the Republican Party, because Republicans Roosevelt and William Howard Taft did not sufficiently support blacks. Most African Americans had been loyal to the Republican Party since the time of Abraham Lincoln.|$|E
