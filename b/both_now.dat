5|$|The Dromaiidae were {{represented}} in Tasmanian territory by two species, <b>both</b> <b>now</b> locally extinct. The King Island emu became extinct around 1802, {{and the original}} populations of emus on Tasmania had vanished by 1865. Whether or not the Tasmanian emu was a separate subspecies is unclear.

5|$|Although {{in places}} {{there was a}} mixture of {{different}} companies and platoons dug in together, the Australians were deployed with the 8th Battalion in the south still centred on Bolton's Ridge. North of them, covering the southern sector of 400 Plateau, were the mixed together 6th and 7th Battalions, <b>both</b> <b>now</b> commanded by Colonel Walter McNicoll of the 6th. North of them was the 5th Battalion, and the 10th Battalion covered the northern sector of 400 Plateau at Johnston's Jolly. But by now they were battalions in name only, having all taken heavy casualties; the commanders had little accurate knowledge of where their men were located.|$|E

5|$|Construction {{work began}} in August 1898, {{although}} the BS was continuing {{to develop new}} route plans. The bill for 1899, published on 22 November 1898, requested more time for the construction works and proposed two extensions to the railway and a modification to part of the previously approved route. The first extension, like the NC's plan from the year before, was to branch from the already-approved route under Park Crescent, but then followed a more northerly route than the NC, running under Regent's Park to cross the park's Outer Circle between Chester Road and Cumberland Gate where a station was to be constructed. The route then followed Cumberland Street West (now Nash Street), Cumberland Market, Cumberland Street East and Edward Street (<b>both</b> <b>now</b> Varndell Street), before ending at a station under Cardington Street {{on the west side}} of Euston station.|$|E
5|$|Cucurbita was {{formally}} {{described in a}} way that meets the requirements of modern botanical nomenclature by Linnaeus in his Genera Plantarum, the fifth edition of 1754 in conjunction with the 1753 first edition of Species Plantarum. Cucurbita pepo is the type species of the genus. Linnaeus initially included the species C. pepo, C. verrucosa and C. melopepo (<b>both</b> <b>now</b> included in C. pepo), as well as C. citrullus (watermelon, now Citrullus lanatus) and C. lagenaria (now Lagenaria siceraria) (both are not Cucurbita but are in the family Cucurbitaceae.|$|E
5|$|Following the Japanese ship-naming conventions, Kawachi and Settsu {{were named}} after ancient Japanese provinces, <b>both</b> <b>now</b> {{a part of}} Osaka prefecture. The only {{significant}} action performed by either ship during World War I was when they bombarded German fortifications in October–November 1914 during {{the final stage of}} the Battle of Tsingtao. They were both assigned to the First Squadron until they were refitted in 1917 and 1916 respectively. Upon their completion of their refits, both ships were assigned to the Second Squadron. On 12 July 1918, Kawachi was sunk in an accidental magazine explosion in Tokuyama Bay that killed over 600 crewmen. Stricken from the Navy List on 21 September 1918, the wreck was later partially dismantled although most of the hull was abandoned in place to serve as an artificial reef.|$|E

5|$|Industrial {{decline from}} {{the turn of}} the 20th century, coupled with the {{building}} of Gateshead's first council estate, saw Carr Hill transformed from an industrial settlement into a residential suburb of the Gateshead Council ward of Deckham. Governed locally and nationally by the Labour Party, the suburb is economically disadvantaged compared to other areas of the borough and nationally, with high levels of unemployment and low levels of income. It is served by Carr Hill Primary School. There are two small parks that contribute to the social activity of the area, as does the Elgin Centre at Elgin Road. Two historic venues, <b>both</b> <b>now</b> closed, face uncertain futures, as does the parish church.|$|E
5|$|On 6 April 1914, the CCE (now {{a part of}} the Northern line) {{opened a}} one stop {{extension}} south from its terminus at Charing Cross. The extension was constructed to facilitate a better interchange between the BS and CCE Both lines were owned by the UERL which operated two separate and unconnected stations at the northern end of main line station – Trafalgar Square on the BS and Charing Cross on the CCE (<b>both</b> <b>now</b> part of a combined Charing Cross station). The CCE extension was constructed as a single track tunnel running south from Charing Cross as a loop under the River Thames and back. A single platform was constructed on the northbound return section of the loop, and escalators were installed between both sets of deep-level platforms and the sub-surface station. The interchange time was reduced from three minutes fifteen seconds to one minute and forty-five seconds.|$|E
5|$|Shepton Mallet had railway {{stations}} on two lines, <b>both</b> <b>now</b> closed. The first station, called Shepton Mallet (High Street) in British Railways days, {{was on the}} East Somerset Railway {{branch line}} from Witham and opened in 1859. The line was extended to Wells in 1862 and later connected to the Cheddar Valley line branch of the Bristol and Exeter Railway from Yatton to Wells via Cheddar. Through services between Yatton and Witham started in 1870. The line was absorbed into the Great Western Railway in the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|The next {{successful}} ascent {{was made}} on January 29, 1834, 40years later, by the Scottish botanist David Douglas, who also reached the summit caldera using the ʻAinapō Trail. By the time Douglas reached the summit the environment had put him under extreme duress, but he nonetheless stayed overnight to make measurements of the summit caldera's proportions and record barometric data on its height, <b>both</b> <b>now</b> known to be widely inaccurate. Douglas collected biological samples on the way both up and down, and after a difficult and distressing descent began collating his samples; he planned to return to England, but instead several months later his body was mysteriously discovered crushed in a pit besides a dead wild boar.|$|E
5|$|French naturalist Lucien Quélet {{transferred}} the species to the now-obsolete genus Dictyopus in 1886, {{which resulted in}} the synonym Dictyopus torosus. Boletus xanthocyaneus, first described by Henri Romagnesi in 1948 as Boletus purpureus var. xanthocyaneus and classified as a species in 1976, was considered by Italian mycologist Carlo Luciano Alessio to be synonymous with B. torosus. Others, however, regard this fungus a distinct species. In 2013 Italian mycologists Valerio Bertolini and Giampaolo Simonini observed that the brevity of the original species description meant that some subsequent papers used B.torosus for specimens that aligned more closely with descriptions of Boletus rhodopurpureus or B.luteocupreus (<b>both</b> <b>now</b> placed in the genus Imperator). They did note that Swiss and French authors had adhered to a more detailed description by Quélet, and that this was the only description faithful to the original description with a grey cap and yellow pores that slowly turn red. They concluded the original description must have been based on specimens growing near the French-Swiss border and hence selected a neotype specimen from this region.|$|E
5|$|Hernán Cortés only {{received}} sporadic {{reports of}} developing events in Honduras, and became impatient for its incorporation into his command. Hopeful of discovering new riches, {{he decided to}} travel to Honduras in person. Cortés left Tenochtitlan on 12 October 1524 with 140 Spanish soldiers, 93 of them mounted, 3,000 Mexican warriors, 150 horses, a herd of pigs, artillery, munitions and other supplies. En route, he recruited 600 Chontal Maya carriers. During the arduous journey from Lake Petén Itzá to Lake Izabal, <b>both</b> <b>now</b> in Guatemala, Cortés lost many men and horses. He crossed the Dulce River to the settlement of Nito, somewhere on the Amatique Bay, with about a dozen companions, where he found the near-starving remnants of González Dávila's colonists, who received him joyfully. Cortés waited there {{for the rest of}} his army to regroup over the next week, and explored the local area for supplies. By this time the remnants of Cortés' expedition were reduced to a few hundred. Cortés sent some of González Dávila's colonists south to the Naco Valley, which was swiftly pacified under the command of Gonzalo de Sandoval, one of Cortés' lieutenants. Cortés then abandoned attempts to colonise Nito, and sailed to Puerto de Caballos with his entire company.|$|E

5|$|In 1879, a {{revision}} of the North American Liliaceae by Sereno Watson described sixteen tribes, of which the Lilieae correspond most closely to current concepts of the family, Bentham and Hooker described twenty tribes in 1883, and Engler and Prantl in their extensive description of the Liliaceae in 1899 identified 31 tribes distributed over 11 subfamilies, with Tulipeae and Alieae representing the modern family. In 1936, Franz Buxbaum undertook a major revision of the Liliaceae and among others described the subfamily Lilioideae with three tribes: Lloydieae (Gagea, Lloydia and Szechenya and Giradiella — <b>both</b> <b>now</b> included in Lloydia), Tulipeae (Erythronium, Tulipa and Eduardoregalia — now part of Tulipa) and Lilieae (Korolkowia, Fritillaria, Notholirion, Cardiocrinum, Nomocharis and Lilium). Hutchinson included most of these genera within the Tulipeae tribe. The complex rearrangements of the various genera, tribes and subfamilies over a 30-year period from 1985, discussed by Peruzzi and colleagues (2009), are partly summarised in Table 2 below.|$|E
5|$|Ninah Cummer and Clara Cummer, <b>both</b> <b>now</b> widows, died in 1958. Ninah Cummer {{left her}} estate, {{including}} her gardens, to the DeEtte Holden Cummer Museum Foundation for a museum to house her art collection. In 1960, the siblings' homes were both demolished {{in order to}} build the museum. Clara and Waldo's property was sold and now houses the Northeast Florida chapter of the American Red Cross and the Cummer's education center, Art Connections. Parts of the gardens were also destroyed during this demolition. The new building was designed by Saxelbye and Powell and constructed in 1961. It featured an Art Deco façade and an inner courtyard that was paved with the terra cotta tiles of the Cummers' old roof. One room from the original Cummer home, known as the Tudor Room, was preserved and incorporated into the new museum. The Cummer Museum of Art & Gardens, then named The Cummer Gallery, opened on November 11, 1961.|$|E
5|$|The slug-like larva of Phoronis ovalis swims {{for about}} 4 days, creeps on the sea-bed for 3 to 4 days, then bores into a {{carbonate}} floor. Nothing {{is known about}} three species. The remaining species develop free-swimming actinotroch larvae, which feed on plankton. The actinotroch is an upright cylinder with the anus {{at the bottom and}} fringed with cilia. At the top is a lobe or hood, under which are: a ganglion, connected to a patch of cilia outside the apex of the hood; a pair of protonephridia (smaller and simpler than the metanephridia in the adult); the mouth; and feeding tentacles that encircle the mouth. After swimming for about 20 days, the actinotroch settles on the seabed and undergoes a catastrophic metamorphosis (radical change) in 30minutes: the hood and larval tentacles are absorbed and the adult lophophore is created round the mouth, and <b>both</b> <b>now</b> points upward; the gut develops a U-bend so that the anus is just under and outside the lophophore. Finally the adult phoronid builds a tube.|$|E
