500|$|Veronica Mars was one {{of roughly}} five series being {{considered}} for cancellation by the network in 2007. At The CW's upfront conference, critic Michael Ausiello asked Ostroff {{about the fate of}} the show. She responded that Thomas and Bell could work together on another show for the network, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that this possibility was unlikely. She said that [...] "it could come back in some form, but I don't know what form that would be". Thomas responded, [...] "I assume that anything Dawn would be talking about in the realm of a Rob–Kristen project would involve a new from-scratch pilot as they don't have me in a deal, and they'll lose Kristen in a couple of weeks." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2013, news {{broke that}} Wood had {{opted not to}} renew her {{contract}} with the show to take another break. According to Soaps In Depth, [...] " [...] threw {{a lot of money}} at her to get her to stay, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it was the right time to go". A representative for the show stated, [...] " [...] is taking short a break, as she has done in the past, from B She remains as the character of 'Steffy Forrester' and is continuing to tape, currently with episodes airing through July 2013 and then beyond". It was later announced that Wood had decided to remain with the series on a recurring basis with episodes airing on July 4 to 12 and September 30 and October 1.|$|E
500|$|Marquess {{deemed the}} storyline {{as a whole}} one which could only be {{depicted}} {{the way it was}} in Hollyoaks, aiming to tell a [...] "tragic story" [...] with a [...] "sweet and humorous tone"." [...] A comedy element of the storyline had Steph use her cancer as a sob story to enter a talent show, recruiting orphan Tom to take to the stage with her, giving her story further emotional impact. Stenson commented, [...] "Deep down she knows she's not a fantastic singer, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the judges would feel sorry for her and put her through." [...] According to Quinlan, viewer feedback on the storyline was [...] "brilliant". He stated that viewers were upset by Steph's illness, and that it had even brought his own mother to tears.|$|E

500|$|When God Writes Your Love Story is {{a popular}} Christian book that {{provides}} alternatives to dating. For this reason, Leah Andrews of the Lewiston Morning Tribune compared the book to Joshua Harris's I Kissed Dating Goodbye and [...] When God Writes Your Love Story also contains Evangelical sexual abstinence teachings. Christine Gardner, a communications professor at Wheaton College, investigates such teachings in , and discusses the Ludys' book {{as part of this}} investigation. Gardner writes that she interviewed a twenty-two-year-old woman who had read When God Writes Your Love Story and [...] "desperately wanted God to write her love story, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that she would help him out by filling in the blanks." [...] Gardner argues that the result [...] "was a fractured fairy tale, one without a happy ending." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's opening musical number, [...] "Red Solo Cup", {{was given}} a mixed {{reception}} by reviewers. Chaney called it a [...] "fun change of pace", though she wasn't fond of Toby Keith, who originated the song; Bell admitted {{she had never been}} [...] "much of a Sam fan", <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> Sam's version [...] "was pretty great". Canning called the song a [...] "terrible choice", and Ford wrote that it [...] "fell unbelievably short". Futterman credited a [...] "surprisingly natural country twang from Sam", but added that the [...] "choir room performance feels mostly stale". Votta could find no sense in its inclusion, and called it the [...] "weirdest song on [...] "Glee" [...] since 'Run Joey Run, while Hankinson was harsher, and declared it to be his [...] "least favorite Glee performance of all time". West, on the other hand, said the song was [...] "perfect for Sam", and Overstreet's [...] "smooth sultry voice nailed it".|$|E
500|$|In her {{review for}} the website TrekNation, Michelle Erica Green {{said that the}} episode entertained, but was an [...] "ultimately {{pointless}} time-travel episode that redeems its existence primarily by not requiring a reset button." [...] <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that Orser was [...] "superb" [...] as the [...] "repugnant" [...] Loomis, and the episode was [...] "entertaining fluff" [...] but was [...] "warm and witty and well-done." [...] Jamahl Epsicokhan on his website [...] "Jammer's Reviews", called the episode a [...] "turkey" [...] and {{said that it was}} [...] "a mediocre time-travel bore with barely enough plot for me to accuse of not making sense." [...] He criticized the lack of explanation given to the Xindi's involvement in the Temporal Cold War, and said that the plot itself was akin to [...] "swiss cheese" [...] due to the number of plot holes. He gave the episode a score of one and a half out of four.|$|E

500|$|... "Love a Woman" [...] {{was written}} by Mary J. Blige, Beyoncé, Sean Garrett and Menardini Timothee while {{production}} was handled by Garrett. Team S. Dot served as the co-producer of the song while BridgeTown served as the additional producer for it. On November 9, 2011, a snippet of [...] "Love a Woman" [...] appeared online.|work=Rap-Up|publisher=Devin Lazerine|date=November 9, 2011|accessdate=May 20, 2013}} It was officially premiered on November 17, prior {{to the release of}} the album. The song was initially recorded by Beyoncé for her fourth studio album 4 (2011), <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> {{that it would be a}} better fit as a duet with Blige. Blige further revealed in an interview that the song was sent to her after Beyoncé thought that it didn't fit her album and it was sent through her A people. She further added, [...] "When the song came, her voice was on it completely and it was just amazing and I wasn't sure that they wanted to give me this record because it was so amazing." [...] Blige further spoke about how she started the collaboration with Beyoncé on the song: ...|$|E
500|$|Mansfield adopted pink as {{her color}} in 1954 and was {{associated}} with pink {{for the rest of}} her career. Her original choice was purple, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it too close to lavender, Kim Novak's signature color. [...] "It must have been the right decision," [...] she said, [...] "because I got more column space from pink than Kim Novak ever did from lavender." [...] For her wedding to Hargitay she wore a tight-fitting gown of pink lace with a flounce of 30 yards of pink tulle (designed by a 20th Century-Fox costume designer), and at the reception she had Hargitay drink pink champagne. In November 1957 (shortly before their marriage), Mansfield bought the 40-room Mediterranean-style mansion (formerly owned by Rudy Vallée) at 10100 Sunset Boulevard in Beverly Hills. Much of the money to buy the house came from her inheritance from Elmer Palmer, her maternal grandfather. Mansfield had the house painted pink, with cupids surrounded by pink fluorescent lights, pink fur in the bathrooms, a pink heart-shaped bathtub and a fountain spurting pink champagne; she then dubbed it the [...] "Pink Palace". Hargitay (a plumber and carpenter before taking up bodybuilding) built the pink heart-shaped swimming pool. The year after reconstructing the [...] "Pink Palace" [...] as a [...] "pink landmark", she began riding a pink Cadillac Eldorado Biarritz convertible with tailfins, then the only pink Cadillac in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|The International Olympic Committee {{commissioned}} a song by Björk specially for the 2004 Summer Olympics opening ceremony. The singer {{revealed that the}} committee asked her to do a kind of [...] "Ebony and Ivory" [...] or [...] "We Are the World" [...] type of song, which are [...] "smashing tunes" [...] according to her, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought,</b> [...] "'Maybe there's another angle to this'. When I tried to write an Olympic lyric, though, {{it was full of}} sports socks and ribbons. I ended up pissing myself laughing". Then, she called Sjón, an Icelandic poet who had previously collaborated with her on songs such as [...] "Bachelorette" [...] from her fourth studio album Homogenic (1997). When she said to him that they would need something [...] "suitably epic" [...] for the Olympics, the poet even took a short course about Greek mythology at Reykjavík University. [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last song recorded for Medúlla. Björk said about the song: [...] "I am incredibly honoured to have been asked to write a song and sing it at the Olympics. The song is written {{from the point of view}} of the ocean that surrounds all the land and watches over the humans to see how they are doing after millions of years of evolution. It sees no borders, different races or religion which has always been at the core of these [...] ".|$|E

2500|$|Jones wrote most of {{the songs}} on the album {{when she was on}} tour during 2004 and 2005; for example, [...] "Until the End" [...] was written in the South Pacific, [...] "Rosie's Lullaby" [...] in Australia, and [...] "The Sun Doesn't Like You" [...] in Brazil. Jones wrote [...] "Thinking About You" [...] in 1999 with Ilhan Ersahin, her then-bandmate in Wax Poetic, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> it {{was too much of a}} pop song for her to record and {{rejected}} a version she recorded for Feels like Home. Jones had an acoustic guitar with her on the tour and wrote more songs with it than she previously had: [...] "The guitar is simple and a lot easier to carry than a piano", she said.|$|E
2500|$|Yoh's friend. He has a {{part-time}} job at a restaurant and, like Fumiya, he is calm and caring (fortunately, he has some common sense and is not as dense as Fumiya). Yoh says that ninety percent of what Asaoka says is out of kindness and that whoever goes out with him would be happy {{because of all the}} kind words he says. He once went on a date with Haruna to make Yoh jealous. When Yoh finally appears at the date Yui tells her that he was acting. He hides his true feelings in jokes, but when Mami tells him [...] "You're always deceiving yourself by passing things off as a joke, so...now you don't even know yourself what your true feelings are." [...] After that he told Haruna that he likes her, <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that he just was acting.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006 Hirsi Ali was {{recognised}} as [...] "European of the Year" [...] by Reader's Digest, an American magazine. In her speech, {{she urged}} action to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. She {{also said that}} Mahmoud Ahmadinejad should be taken at his word in wanting to organise a conference to investigate objective evidence of the Holocaust, noting that the subject is not taught in the Middle East. She said, [...] "Before I came to Europe, I'd {{never heard of the}} Holocaust. That is the case with millions of people in the Middle East. Such a conference should be able to convince many people away from their denial of the genocide against the Jews." [...] She also said that what some have described as [...] "Western values" [...] of freedom and justice were universal. <b>But</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> that Europe has done far better than most areas of the world in providing justice, as it has guaranteed the freedom of thought and debate required for critical self-examination. She said communities cannot reform unless [...] "scrupulous investigation of every former and current doctrine is possible." [...] Hirsi Ali was nominated as a candidate for the Nobel Peace Prize the same month by Norwegian parliamentarian Christian Tybring-Gjedde.|$|E

2500|$|Ben Ratliff of The New York Times {{called the}} {{production}} grandiose but considered the concert an [...] "achievement, integrated and sure-footed". Like other reviewers, {{he had a}} higher regard for the band's new material after seeing it performed live, saying the songs had [...] "surprising authority" [...] and [...] "stronger blood". Ratliff concluded his review: [...] "U2's hunger to combine and include has only grown greater; {{the triumph of the}} concert was finding an ordered, comprehensive rationale for it." [...] Rob Hastings of The Independent called a London concert [...] "one of the most unforgettable arena shows most people will have seen". Despite reservations about the band's new material from Songs of Innocence, Hastings praised them for using the visuals to make the songs' personal nature connect with the audience. He said, [...] "The songs blossom as their meanings emerge through the pixels as much as the lyrics." [...] In another review of a London concert, Kitty Empire of The Observer said that the video screens offered [...] "mixed-media renderings of U2's songs which veer from the mawkish to the mesmerising", <b>but</b> <b>she</b> <b>thought</b> the band [...] "give great, thoughtful son et lumière". Dorian Lynskey of Q said, [...] "Just as Zoo TV and 360° reinvented stadium rock, this tour offered a glimpse into the future of arena shows." ...|$|E
