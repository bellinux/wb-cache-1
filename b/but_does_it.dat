25|$|Finally, some detractors {{have pointed}} out that the WHD {{collects}} the same data as the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> with inferior methods. The BLS samples wages randomly instead of relying on self-reporting. The BLS also uses an interview approach to eliminate reporting errors. Academic researchers have found significant variations between the more accurate and timely BLS data and the WHD data; variances may run around 9%, but in some cases the WHD data may be too low. For these reasons, the DOL Office of Inspector General directed the WHD to investigate whether the BLS wage data could be used in place of the WHD wage data. They declined to do so, prompting another audit of their methodology.|$|E

2500|$|The {{critic of}} the Greek {{newspaper}} Ethnos complained that the film presented [...] "a nice, well-tended Buchenwald, where only the disobedient and the communists are punished severely." [...] The reviewer of Ta Nea commented: [...] "All the 'terrible things' {{we see in the}} studio version are not even a pale imitation of Buchenwald's reality... Of course the film was made by Germans, <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> give them the right to talk about the noose without mentioning the victims?" ...|$|E

2500|$|The birds migrate {{with both}} nonstop and short-distance multiple-stop flights. During their {{migration}} {{from north to}} south, they fly over the Atlantic Ocean, gradually moving along the northeastern coast of South America before heading inland towards the islands. This travel generally takes about one month. On their migration from south to north, the white-rumped sandpiper follows a similar path, <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> much more quickly. This migration is done in a fast series of long flights without stopping. One nonstop flight can be as long as [...]|$|E

6000|$|Maud coloured; {{after which}} she smiled faintly, and proceeded: [...] "We should speak reverently of a father--and such a father, too. <b>But</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> not seem {{probable}} to you, Bob, that the many discussions he has with Mr. Woods {{may have a}} tendency to confirm each in his notions?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I doubt not," [...] {{said the}} Deputy coldly.

6000|$|Of course, {{there are}} {{thousands}} of lads whose paths are not so clearly marked out; <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> not seem reasonable to expect that, with prayer for guidance, and thoughtful consideration {{on the part of the}} boy's parents, as well as of the boy himself, the best path in life may be discovered for each? ...|$|E

6000|$|Again, if the United States be not a {{government}} proper, but {{an association of}} States {{in the nature of}} contract merely, can it as a contract be peaceably unmade by less than all the parties who made it?

6000|$|Audible {{prayer is}} impressive; it gives {{momentary}} solemnity and elevation to thought; <b>but</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> produce any lasting benefit? Looking deeply into these things, {{we find that}} [...] "a zeal... not according to knowledge," [...] gives occasion for reaction unfavorable to spiritual growth, sober resolve, and wholesome perception of God's requirements.

Mr. Cary, with some other commentators, thinks that the [...] "trembling" [...] implies fear of being refused. <b>But</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> not rather mean the agony of the humiliation?

(Even our shipowners don't want to drown their sailors; they will only do it for sufficient motive.) If the dirty creatures did want to make smoke, there would be more excuse for them: and that they are not clever enough to consume it, is no praise to them.

60|$|I {{think that}} {{objection}} {{is based upon}} a misconception of the real relations which exist between structure and function, between mechanism and work. Function is the expression of molecular forces and arrangements no doubt; <b>but,</b> <b>does</b> <b>it</b> follow from this, that variation in function so depends upon variation in structure that the former is always exactly proportioned to the latter? If {{there is no such}} relation, if the variation in function which follows on a variation in structure may be enormously greater than the variation of the structure, then, you see, the objection falls to the ground.|$|E
