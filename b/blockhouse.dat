5|$|Around 1627, Robert Morton, {{the mayor}} of Hull, had an {{additional}} rectangular earthwork battery of four guns constructed around the south <b>blockhouse</b> to defend the estuary against a potential Spanish and French invasion threat. The South End Fort {{was built on the}} other side of the river from the South <b>Blockhouse</b> at the same time, provided supporting crossfire. In 1634, a survey showed the North <b>Blockhouse</b> to be mounting 24 pieces of artillery, the castle 29, and the South <b>Blockhouse</b> 24 guns. Catholic recusants continued to be detained in the castle and blockhouses, where they were ill-treated by the keepers, typically men with strong Puritan sympathies.|$|E
5|$|During the interregnum {{following}} the English Civil War, the Old <b>Blockhouse</b> {{was occupied by}} the Royalists and it was attacked by the Parliamentary forces of Sir Robert Blake in 1651. Blake's naval guns out-ranged those of the fort, and, after fierce fighting, the <b>blockhouse</b> was taken. A battery of guns was maintained at the <b>blockhouse</b> until at least the 1750s, {{but by the end}} of the 18th century the fortification was disused and in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Gravesend <b>Blockhouse</b> was {{designed}} by the Clerk of the King's Works, James Nedeham, and the Master of Ordnance, Christopher Morice, with Robert Lorde serving as the paymaster for the project and Lionel Martin, John Ganyn and Mr Travers acting as the local overseers. The Crown bought the land for the fort, along with the space for Gravesend <b>Blockhouse,</b> from William Burston for £66; it is uncertain how much the building work cost, but earlier estimates in 1539 had suggested that it would cost £211 to build such a <b>blockhouse,</b> including the 150,000 bricks and quantities of stone, chalk, lime, timber and labour that would be needed. The work was quickly completed, and by 1540 the <b>blockhouse</b> was fully operational.|$|E
50|$|<b>Blockhouses</b> {{were found}} in D-Day, {{representing}} pillboxes along the shores of Normandy. <b>Blockhouses</b> had token defense, but were excellent in making counterattacks. Certain <b>blockhouses</b> also {{had the ability to}} fire out to sea, allowing the German player to eliminate allied reinforcements for the next turn. Conversely, naval bombardment (represented by a naval bombardment phase in D-Day) allowed the safe removal of <b>blockhouses</b> from play.|$|R

5|$|Land erosion has {{damaged the}} East <b>Blockhouse</b> site; the north wall {{collapsed}} before 1975, and between 2010 and 2011 {{there was another}} major landslip. An archaeological survey of the <b>blockhouse,</b> funded by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw, took place in 2011. The East <b>Blockhouse</b> is the only such defensive structure to survive in Wales and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch fleet raided up the Thames in June 1667, {{but did not}} {{approach}} Gravesend <b>Blockhouse</b> due to {{the threat posed by}} its guns. The fort, under the command of Sir John Griffith, was in reality not well prepared for war. £400 was spent on upgrading the <b>blockhouse,</b> artillery was sent from the Tower of London to reinforce the local guns and four infantry companies were detached to guard the site. The risk of attack ended with the signing of the Peace of Breda that July, and the <b>blockhouse</b> did not see action. Shortly after the Dutch raids, Sir John was removed from his post for apparently demanding payments from ships passing by the <b>blockhouse,</b> a complaint which was repeated in later years under subsequent captains.|$|E
5|$|The West <b>Blockhouse</b> was {{demolished}} in the 19th century, when West <b>Blockhouse</b> Fort {{was built}} on the same site, and there are no visible remains.|$|E
50|$|The battery {{consists}} of a semi-circular gun platform ringed by a parapet with six embrasures, and two <b>blockhouses</b> joined together by a wall. The <b>blockhouses</b> had musketry loopholes intended to protect the battery from a land attack. A ramp originally led to the entrance, which is located between the <b>blockhouses.</b> The battery's seaward side is protected by a small ditch, and salt pans are located close by.|$|R
50|$|According to the {{information}} provided by Ridenour, the nightly guard duty {{and the use of}} the <b>blockhouses</b> continued to roughly the end of the Civil War. After that time, nothing more was mentioned of the <b>blockhouses.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 1 August 1794, Major Ebenezer Denny {{reported}} to Governor Thomas Mifflin from Le Boeuf. He described a fortification with four <b>blockhouses,</b> manned by riflemen. The two rear <b>blockhouses</b> had a six-pound cannon {{on the second}} floor, as well as swivel guns over the gates.|$|R
5|$|Amid rising {{concerns}} over {{the threat of a}} French invasion, Sir Thomas Page surveyed the <b>blockhouse</b> in 1778 and concluded that its guns were too closely packed together and that they could not easily fire down-river, proposing that a larger fort be built along the Thames to the east to rectify this problem. New Tavern Fort was constructed shortly afterwards and the eastern Gravesend <b>Blockhouse</b> gun platform was redesigned and extended as part of the work. Two volunteer militia companies were established in 1794 and 1797 to support the <b>blockhouse</b> and in 1805 it was equipped with 19 32 lb guns.|$|E
5|$|Blake {{arrived at}} St Helen's Pool in April 1651 {{and set about}} taking the island of Tresco, attacking the harbour of Old Grimsby and the <b>blockhouse.</b> Blake {{deployed}} a force of men in small boats, but they landed on the wrong island {{and had to be}} recalled to the ships. The next day the men landed on the beaches below the blockhouse; fighting ensued and the attackers were driven back. Blake's men made another landing which also saw fierce resistance, and the guns of the <b>blockhouse</b> were probably turned on the landing parties. Around 15 of the assault force were killed, but the guns of Blake's ships guns had a longer range than those of the <b>blockhouse</b> and Old Grimsby fell. Blake went on to use Tresco as a basis for taking St Mary's.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{continued}} to be raised that the blockhouse's guns could not fire downriver and by the 1830s it had been decided to focus investment on the New Tavern and Tilbury forts. The <b>blockhouse</b> itself fell out of use as a magazine in 1834, being briefly used as a government store, and the adjacent gun platforms were sold off in 1835. The <b>blockhouse</b> building was subsequently demolished in 1844.|$|E

5|$|The East and West Blockhouses were Device Forts {{built by}} King Henry VIII in 1539 {{to protect the}} harbour of Milford Haven in Wales. The two blockhouses were {{positioned}} {{on either side of}} the Milford Haven Waterway in the villages of Angle and Dale respectively, overlooking the sea. The East <b>Blockhouse</b> was never completed, but the remains were reused as a defensive site in the Second World War. The West <b>Blockhouse</b> was described by contemporaries as forming a round tower with gunports, but it was demolished when West <b>Blockhouse</b> Fort was built on the same site in the 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The Old <b>Blockhouse</b> {{was built}} {{as part of}} this {{programme}} of work. The <b>blockhouse</b> was positioned on high ground to protect the Old Grimsby harbour, overlooking both the harbour and the nearby anchorage of St Helen's Pool. When complete, it would have held a battery of two to three guns, which could have fired on targets attempting to enter the harbour, or engaged ships approaching the Scilly Isles from the north-east.|$|E

50|$|During the Second Boer War the British forces built a {{large number}} of fortifications in South Africa. Around 441 were solid masonry <b>blockhouses,</b> many of which stand today. Different designs were used in the {{construction}} of these <b>blockhouses,</b> but most were either two or three story structures built using locally quarried stone.|$|R
50|$|In 1715, a {{semi-circular}} gun battery {{was built}} around the seaward side of the tower. The battery had a low parapet, with guns being mounted en barbette. There were two <b>blockhouses,</b> which were linked by a V-shaped redan containing the main gate. Both the <b>blockhouses</b> and the redan were pierced with musketry loopholes.|$|R
5|$|The {{design of}} the <b>blockhouse</b> is {{conservative}} for the period, and echoes that of the forts built {{during the reign of}} Henry VIII. This is in contrast to the nearby fortification of Harry's Walls, built {{at the same time as}} the <b>blockhouse,</b> but which adopted a more contemporary design that employed bastions.|$|E
5|$|Gravesend <b>Blockhouse</b> was an {{artillery}} fortification constructed {{as part of}} Henry VIII's Device plan of 1539, in response to fears of an imminent invasion of England by France and the Holy Roman Empire. It was built at Gravesend in Kent along a strategic point along the River Thames and was operational by 1540. A two-storey, D-shaped building built from brick and stone, it had a circular bastion overlooking the river and gun platforms extending out {{to the east and}} west. It functioned in conjunction with Tilbury Fort {{on the other side of}} the river, and was repaired in 1588 to deal with the threat of Spanish invasion, and again in 1667 when the Dutch navy raided the Thames. A 1778 report recommended alterations to the <b>blockhouse</b> and its defences, leading to the remodelling of the gun platforms and the construction of the new, larger New Tavern Fort alongside it. In the 1830s the government decided to rely entirely on the newer fort and the old <b>blockhouse</b> was demolished in 1844. Its remains were uncovered in archaeological excavations between 1975 and 1976.|$|E
5|$|In 1553, {{orders were}} issued for the {{artillery}} pieces {{to be removed}} from the <b>blockhouse</b> and taken to the Tower of London; the fort was then demolished between 1557 and 1558, the brick and stone from the site being reused to repair the Tower. The former site was probably rediscovered during excavations in 1826, but was destroyed during the building of the Gravesend Canal Basin, Canal Road and the Gordon Pleasure Gardens later in the 19th century. Archaeological investigations between 1973 and 1978 uncovered the foundations of the <b>blockhouse,</b> now protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E

5|$|Milton <b>Blockhouse</b> was {{designed}} by the Clerk of the King's Works, James Nedeham, and the Master of Ordnance, Christopher Morice, with Robert Lorde serving as the paymaster for the project and Lionel Martin, John Ganyn and Mr Travers acting as the local overseers. The fort was built on Chapel Field, which the Crown bought, along with the land for Gravesend <b>Blockhouse,</b> from William Burston for £66; the field had previously been part of Milton Chantry, dissolved by Henry VIII during the Reformation. The work was quickly completed, and by 1540 the <b>blockhouse</b> was in operation and equipped with 30 artillery guns, 6 handguns and various pikes and longbows. Initially commanded by Captain Sir Edward Cobham, it had a small garrison of 12 men, including a second in command, a porter, three soldiers and seven gunners; these men would have been supported by reinforcements if the fort had ever come under attack.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{were made}} to seal off the river with a chain or a boom {{stretching}} between the <b>blockhouse</b> and Tilbury Fort on the other bank, which was eventually accomplished {{at a cost of}} £305. Further work was carried out on the defences, possibly including raising earthworks and establishing watch-houses. Fears of an invasion persisted for many years afterwards and in 1598 Charles Howard, the Lord High Admiral, expressed his concerns about the effectiveness of the Gravesend <b>Blockhouse</b> in protecting the Thames.|$|E
