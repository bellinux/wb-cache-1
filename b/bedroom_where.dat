5|$|Bamber's lawyers {{argued that}} images of Sheila {{taken by a}} police {{photographer}} at around 9am on 7 August 1985 showed her blood was still wet. According to the defence team, had she been killed before 3:30am, as the prosecution said, the blood would have congealed by 9am. They argue that she was alive when Bamber was standing outside {{the house with the}} police, shot herself in the kitchen just as the police entered, then ran up one of the staircases to the <b>bedroom,</b> <b>where</b> she shot herself again, this time fatally.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} a blonde woman, played by model and actress Lauren Hastings (allegedly portraying Britney Spears), walking {{out of her house}} hand-in-hand with an {{unidentified}} man. The couple leaves in the woman's car (a silver Porsche) as Timberlake rolls down the window of a black Mercedes, from which he and his friend have been watching the woman. Timberlake breaks into the house by throwing a rock through a window and proceeds through the woman's house, with anti-gravity jumps and slides, not causing any other visible damage, except for kicking a picture frame of the woman across the living room. Then he searches some drawers and finds a video camera, while the driver of the car, Timbaland, signals for his female accomplice {{in the back of the}} car, played by model Kiana Bessa, to go in. She enters the house and goes with Timberlake to a <b>bedroom,</b> <b>where</b> she starts to undress and kiss him while being filmed. They stay in the bedroom for a moment; then the accomplice exits the house but Timberlake stays. As the blonde woman returns, he follows her around the house and hides in a closet as she showers. He gets closer to her and touches the glass surrounding the shower. The blonde woman senses someone in the room and turns around, but Timberlake is gone. She leaves the bathroom and goes into her <b>bedroom,</b> <b>where</b> the video he made with his new lover plays on the television.|$|E

5|$|Matt Bissonnette, a SEAL {{who participated}} in the raid, wrote an account of the mission in the book No Easy Day (2012), which {{significantly}} contradicts Pfarrer's account. Bissonnette wrote that the helicopter approach and landing matched the official version. According to Bissonnette, when bin Laden peered out at the Americans advancing on his third-floor room, the SEAL who fired upon him hit him {{on the right side of}} the head. Bin Laden stumbled into his <b>bedroom,</b> <b>where</b> the SEALs found him crumpled and twitching on the floor in a pool of body matter, with two women crying over his body. The other SEALs allegedly grabbed the women, moved them away, and shot bin Laden repeatedly in the chest until he was dead.

5|$|Katy and Shell {{explore and}} enter Hector's <b>bedroom,</b> <b>where</b> {{they find a}} circle of salt around the bed. They hear the bell again and trace the sound to Andras's room. When Katy opens the bed's curtains, Andras's {{deformed}} body is revealed; he {{is tied to the}} bed and gagged. Katy goes to untie him, believing that Hector and Tabitha have kept him prisoner. Shell asks how Andras could have rung the bell if his hands were tied. Hector and Tabitha appear and show that it is they who rang the bell. They quote Dante's Inferno and explain that Hell is cold, as the text says, so the house must be kept refrigerated for Andras. They say he was possessed at age ten by Castiel, demon of mischief, but Castiel needs a new human host every fifty years, and Andras is now dying. Katy was chosen as the next host after a mutual friend at Tabitha and Hector's church recommended her to them. It is revealed that Shell also attends the church, and she helped them to lure Katy. Shell implies that the church's members protect the earth from being overrun by demons.|$|E

To the moment Lloreda it comes to the <b>bedrooms</b> <b>where</b> his companions suspect and are afraid that it has betrayed them, Lloreda denies to have done it. The Lieutenant Solorzano believes him, since if it had betrayed them, the military police already would be requisitioning the beds and the belongings, Solorzano returns the money to him and it is required silence from him while he would ask for a permission the Major Loaiza in order that the soldiers could go out for the nearby people and get out the money, which it obtains to the moment; Loaiza habia given a permission of exit for one day, therefore Solorzano demands from the soldiers the soldiers not to call the attention with the money because it would cause a domino effect that would fuck them all.|$|R

5|$|The rebels {{moved into}} Magomero {{in the early}} evening, while Livingstone {{and his wife were}} {{entertaining}} some dinner guests. The estate official, Duncan MacCormick, was in another house nearby. A third building, occupied by Emily Stanton, Alyce Roach and five children, contained a small cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to the local rifle club. The insurgents quietly broke into the Livingstone's house and injured him during hand-to-hand fighting, prompting him to take refuge in the <b>bedroom,</b> <b>where</b> his wife attempted to treat his wounds. The rebels forced their way into the bedroom, and after capturing his wife, decapitated Livingstone. MacCormick, who had been alerted, was killed by a rebel spear. The attackers took the women and children of the village prisoner but shortly released them unhurt, having reportedly treated them well. It has been suggested that Chilembwe may have hoped to use the women and children as hostages, but this remains unclear. The attack on Magomero, and in particular the killing of Livingstone, had great symbolic significance for Chilembwe's men. The two Mauser rifles captured from the plantation formed the basis of the rebel armoury {{for the rest of the}} uprising.|$|E

50|$|These clocks {{were almost}} always repeaters, that is {{striking}} clocks {{which could be}} made to repeat the striking of the hours at the pull of a lever or cord. This feature was used before artificial illumination to tell what time it was at night. However, because they were often used in <b>bedrooms</b> <b>where</b> the hourly striking of the bell could disturb sleepers, they either had a knob to silence the hourly striking, or did not strike on the hour at all but only at the pull of the cord. These were called 'silent pull repeaters'.|$|R

50|$|At {{the end of}} the Battle of Passchendaele, having {{expanded}} the Ypres Salient by retaking Passendale Ridge, the British were left with little natural shelter from the former woods and farms. The artillery of both sides had literally flattened the landscape. As the static nature of the conflict gave way to a more mobile war, and the opposing sides developed better technology and tactics, particularly in artillery, the need arose to protect troops within deeper and deeper shelters close to the frontline. What started out as simple blast shelters turned over time into subterranean hospitals, mess rooms, chapels, kitchens, workshops, blacksmiths, as well as <b>bedrooms</b> <b>where</b> exhausted soldiers could rest.|$|R
5000|$|The {{book was}} {{reviewed}} in Publishers Weekly in 2002: [...] "Söderberg manifests a keen painterly eye for settings: Arvid and Lydia's affair plays out {{against a backdrop}} of serene Stockholm parks, crowded newspaper offices full of workaholic journalists and the spare <b>bedrooms</b> <b>where</b> their trysts take place—and in each locale, the details offered are just enough to create a world of sensations. Feminist readers may take umbrage at the male domination of Arvid's milieu—women get little or no air time, although they would seem to determine the course of the novel. Söderberg creates psychological suspense worthy of Dostoyevski, as Arvid's internal moral conflicts achieve the gravity of physical pain." ...|$|R

Rolling murdered Larson, first taping her mouth shut to stifle her screams and then stabbing her to death. She died while trying to fend him off. Rolling then went back downstairs, taped Powell's mouth shut, bound her wrists together behind her back and threatened her with a knife as he cut her clothes off of her. He then raped her and forced her face-down onto the floor, where he stabbed her five times in the back. Rolling posed the bodies in sexually provocative positions and left the apartment.|$|E
