Calfhow Pike would have little significance in more rugged areas of the Lake District, <b>but</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst of smooth green slopes it is a conspicuous landmark visible for miles around. Although it has little prominence, it is a pleasant top giving good views of the surrounding grassy slopes and the valleys below.|$|E
2500|$|The Mishnah (following [...] ) {{taught that}} a sin-offering {{of a bird}} preceded a burnt-offering of a bird; and the priest also {{dedicated}} them in that order. Rabbi Eliezer taught that wherever an offerer (because of poverty) substituted for an animal sin-offering the offering of two birds (one of which was for a sin-offering {{and the other for}} a burnt-offering), the priest sacrificed the bird sin-offering before the bird burnt-offering (as [...] instructs). But {{in the case of a}} woman after childbirth discussed in [...] (where a poor new mother could substitute for an animal burnt-offering two birds, one for a sin-offering and the other for a burnt-offering), the bird burnt-offering took precedence over the bird sin-offering. Wherever the offering came on account of sin, the sin-offering took precedence. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of a woman after childbirth, where the sin-offering was not on account of sin) the burnt-offering took precedence. And wherever both birds came instead of one animal sin-offering, the sin-offering took precedence. <b>But</b> <b>here</b> (<b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of a woman after childbirth) they did not both come on account of a sin-offering (for in poverty she substituted a bird burnt-offering for an animal burnt-offering, as [...] required her to bring a bird sin-offering in any case), the burnt-offering took precedence. (The Gemara asked whether this contradicted the Mishnah, which taught that a bird sin-offering took precedence over an animal burnt-offering, whereas here she brought the animal burnt-offering before the bird sin-offering.) Rava taught that [...] merely accorded the bird burnt-offering precedence in the mentioning. (Thus, some read Rava to teach that [...] lets the reader read first about the burnt-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first. Others read Rava to teach that one first dedicated the animal or bird for the burnt-offering and then dedicated the bird for the sin-offering, but in fact the priest sacrificed the sin-offering first.) ...|$|E

60|$|The face, {{from its}} indecent expression, had {{particularly}} animated the zeal of our iconoclast; {{and it was}} against the face that he began his operations.

60|$|It {{took them}} {{three days of}} arduous labour; but the valley at last opened out, and they saw a broad expanse of country {{stretching}} before them.
