David Tutera, a wedding planner and host of My Fair Wedding with David Tutera, acted as Doherty's event planner. The series also featured Doherty's friends, Roxana Zal, Tim Bitici, and Roger Castillo, and her mother, Rosa. According to Doherty, her mother was well-received by fans on Twitter.

25|$|The {{layout of}} the house {{remained}} {{much the same as}} the previous series, although the kitchen moved {{to the other side of}} the main living area. One big theme in the house was annoyance; the kitchen appliances were scattered around the house, with the oven and heat proof surface in the bedroom and the fridge in the garden. As further annoyance, the bathtub was placed in an open space right next to the main living room. Where the oven was in the <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> approximately where the kitchen area was located in Big Brother 7.|$|E

In the earliest seasons of the show, the brothers' shared <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> {{the only part of}} the manor shown, but in later years, their kitchen was also used. This remained largely the case during the follow-up series The Podge and Rodge Show, although the living room was featured in the Bogmannay special on New Year's Eve 2006. The underground dungeon of Ballydung Manor was also shown in an episode of the chatshow when Podge and Rodge invited guest Sheana Keane to partake in a gruesome game of Operation!.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} {{of the house was}} much smaller than the year before. The living room was brought back inside the house, with two glass doors separating it from the main floor area.

The <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> across from the living room, and featured a waterbed, the bathroom was accessed through the bedroom, and featured a bath, shower and also a toilet. The kitchen was small and beside the door leading to the garden.

The interior stairs remained closed off once again, and had a yellow and black theme.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} murder, US {{attorney}} Jack Thompson, who has campaigned against violence in video games, {{claimed that he}} had written to Rockstar after the game was released, warning them {{that the nature of}} the game could inspire copycat killings, but had been ignored. Soon thereafter, the Pakeerah family hired Thompson with the aim of suing Sony and Rockstar for £50 million in a wrongful death claim. However, {{on the same day that}} Thompson was hired, the police officially denied any link between the game and the murder, citing drug-related robbery as the motive, and revealing that the game had been found in Pakeerah's <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> not Leblanc's, as originally reported. The presiding judge during the trial also placed sole responsibility with Leblanc, sentencing him to life. Although the Pakeerahs and Thompson continued to maintain that the game was Leblanc's, their case against Sony and Rockstar was dropped soon thereafter.|$|E

500|$|Reagan {{became the}} First Lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as {{president}} in January 1981. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated {{her desire to}} create a more suitable [...] "first home" [...] in the White House, as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect. White House aide Michael Deaver described the second and third floor family residence as having [...] "cracked plaster walls, chipped paint [...] beaten up floors"; rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations. In 1981, Reagan directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors and rooms adjacent to the Oval Office, including the press briefing room. The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires. The closet in the master <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room, and the West <b>bedroom</b> <b>was</b> made into a small gymnasium.|$|E
