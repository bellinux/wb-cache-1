25|$|Before {{actually}} quilting fabrics, some quilters <b>baste</b> the quilt. Basting is {{the practice}} of making long, loose stitches in a grid format {{across the surface of}} the quilt to hold the layers of the quilt together and to prevent them from shifting during the quilting process. Basting can also be done using large curved safety pins rather than machine or hand basting.|$|E

CSB won in the Finals of 2000, bannered by what is dubbed as the best CSB Blazers team ever assembled. With 1999 NCAA Rookie of the Year and 2002 NCAA MVP Sunday Salvacion, Jondan Salvador, and 2000 NCAA Rookie of the Year Alejandro Magpayo leading the charge, the St. Benilde Blazers beat the {{formidable}} San Sebastian Stags and won their first NCAA seniors basketball championship title, despite joining the league a season earlier. This marks the fastest win for any new school in the league since the World War.|$|E

Originally released in Belgium in 2003, by the mid-2005, the song {{reached the top}} 10 of the Billboard Hot 100, and was certified gold in October by the RIAA. Also that year, several songs were released as re-mixes and covers. Among them: two prominent versions of [...] "Fading Like a Flower", one a trance cover by German group Mysterio and one a sampling by Dancing DJs that reached the UK chart. In November 2005, while Gessle {{was in the middle}} of promoting his Son of a Plumber album, he and Fredriksson appeared at the Dorchester Hotel in London for an awards presentation by Broadcast Music Incorporated (BMI). Gessle received two awards, the first for [...] "It Must Have Been Love", which by that time had been played on US radio more than 4 million times, while he and co-songwriter Mats Persson also received an award for Dance Song of the Year for D.H.T.'s cover of [...] "Listen to Your Heart". The ceremony marked the first time Gessle and Fredriksson had appeared in public together since before the onset of Fredriksson's brain tumour and subsequent surgery in 2002. When asked by an Aftonbladet reporter if there would be a Roxette reunion, Gessle replied, [...] "We haven't decided yet. No doors are closed. We're still young". Fredriksson returned in 2006 with an album of Swedish cover songs, titled Min <b>bäste</b> vän (My Best Friend), while Gessle recorded two more solo albums, En händig man (A Handy Man) (2007) and Party Crasher (2008).|$|E

When a given piece is completely surrounded by all the adjacent shapes, the <b>basting</b> thread is cut, and the <b>basting</b> and the paper shape are removed.|$|R

2500|$|Duterte {{was once}} married to Elizabeth Abellana Zimmerman, a flight {{attendant}} who hails from Davao City and is of German American descent who also traces her roots in Tuburan, Cebu. They together have three children (from eldest to youngest): Paolo ("Pulong"), Sara ("Inday Sara") and Sebastian ("Bastê"). Paolo and Sara ventured into politics while <b>Baste,</b> with no interest in politics, concentrated on business and surfing. Paolo married twice, first with Lovelie Sangkola whom he had separated with, and second with January Navares-Duterte, his current wife. Sara is currently married to a fellow lawyer while <b>Baste</b> has two kids: a daughter with a former girlfriend and a son with current girlfriend Kate Necesario. In 2012, Duterte made a notorious remark in a media interview regarding an incident where Paolo's name was allegedly linked to a carnapping (portmanteau of car and kidnapping) syndicate led by Ryan Yu. Duterte is infamously quoted as having said: [...] "Kill my son Paolo if he is involved in crime." [...] Paolo was never charged for lack of evidence and eventually won the Davao City vice mayoralty in 2013. Duterte's father Vicente died in 1968 while his mother Soledad died on February 4, 2012, {{at the age of}} 95. Zimmerman was diagnosed with stage 3 breast cancer in 2015.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>basting</b> stitch is {{essentially}} a straight stitch, sewn with long stitches and unfinished ends. The <b>basting</b> stitch is used for temporarily holding sandwiched pieces of fabric in place. The stitch is removed after the piece is finished. Often used in quilting or embroidery.|$|R

This base consisted of two or three layers of fabric with the parchment pattern on top. The layers were then <b>basted</b> together. The pattern was then laid over with a gimp which was <b>basted</b> down through the pattern and layers of support fabric. When the lace was finished, the <b>basting</b> stitches were cut between the layers thus leaving only the Lace.|$|R
