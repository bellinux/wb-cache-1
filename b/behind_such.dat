5|$|When World War II began, Teller {{wanted to}} {{contribute}} to the war effort. On the advice of the well-known Caltech aerodynamicist and fellow Hungarian émigré Theodore von Kármán, Teller collaborated with his friend Hans Bethe in developing a theory of shock-wave propagation. In later years, their explanation of the behavior of the gas <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> a wave proved valuable to scientists who were studying missile re-entry.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the United States Football League {{formed as}} a spring league, and enjoyed {{moderate}} success during its first two seasons <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> stars as Jim Kelly and Herschel Walker. In 1985, the league, which lost {{a considerable amount of}} money due to overspending on players, opted to gamble on moving its schedule to fall in 1986 and filing a billion-dollar antitrust lawsuit against the NFL in an effort to stay afloat. When the lawsuit only drew a three-dollar judgment, the USFL folded.|$|E

5|$|In Austria, Kepler left <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> a {{historical}} legacy {{that he was}} one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the 10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin, minted on September 10, 2002. The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg personally, and he probably influenced the construction of Eggenberg Castle (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from Mysterium Cosmographicum.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the growing debate over Zeus' abilities, the US {{conducted}} its first high yield, high altitude tests – Hardtack Teak on 1 August 1958, and Hardtack Orange on 12 August. These demonstrated a number of previously unknown or underestimated effects, notably that nuclear fireballs grew to very large size and caused all of the air in or immediately below the fireball to become opaque to radar signals, an effect that became known as nuclear blackout. This was extremely worrying for any system like Zeus, which {{would not be able to}} track warheads in or <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> a fireball, including those of the Zeus' own warheads.|$|E
5|$|It {{rejects the}} Christian {{emphasis}} on sin and guilt, believing that these generate fear and thus negativity, which then hinder spiritual evolution. It also typically criticises the blaming and judging of others for their actions, believing {{that if an}} individual adopts these negative attitudes it harms their own spiritual evolution. Instead the movement emphasizes positive thinking, although beliefs regarding the power <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> thoughts vary within New Age literature. Common New Age examples of how to generate such positive thinking include the repeated recitation of mantras and statements carrying positive messages, and the visualisation of a white light.|$|E

5|$|By {{the second}} half of the twentieth century, the declining {{population}} trend had gone into reverse. Increasing numbers of retired people were arriving to make their home in the tranquil surroundings, and after the Beacham Commission in the 1960s, the British government realised that the rural way of life in parts of Wales was in crisis, and started to react. Through government initiatives and local actions, opportunities in tourism, rural crafts, specialist food shops, farmers' markets and added-value food products began to emerge. However, in 2011, at 3.1%, Ceredigion still had one of the highest proportions of its population working in agriculture, forestry and fishing, close <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> other places as Orkney and Shetland. Another use for marginal land in exposed positions is the provision of renewable wind energy; Cefn Croes Wind Farm near Devil's Bridge has 39 turbines and a nominal capacity of 58,500kW.|$|E
5|$|Members of {{the genus}} Portia have hunting tactics as {{versatile}} and adaptable as a lion's. All members of Portia have instinctive tactics for their most common prey, but can improvise {{by trial and error}} against unfamiliar prey or in unfamiliar situations, and then remember the new approach. They can also make detours to find the best attack angle against dangerous prey, even when the best detour takes a Portia out of visual contact with the prey, and sometimes the planned route leads to abseiling down a silk thread and biting the prey from <b>behind.</b> <b>Such</b> detours may take up to an hour, and a Portia usually picks the best route even if it needs to walk past an incorrect route. If a Portia makes a mistake while hunting another spider, it may itself be killed.|$|E

25|$|There {{were also}} cases where large {{differences}} between estimated intensities by the Earthquake Early Warning {{system and the}} actual intensities occurred in the aftershocks and triggered earthquakes. JMA attributed the reason <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> discrepancy in the warning to the system's inability to separate two different earthquakes that happened at around same time, and also the reduced amount of available seismometer due to power outage and connection fail. The system's software was subsequently modified to handle this kind of situation.|$|E

40|$|Solutions to {{the problem}} of {{structural}} and fluidic vibrations in ventilation systems are urgently required because today's lightweight construction trend increases the risk of system failure which are caused by vibrations. Pressure disturbances are known to occur <b>behind</b> elements <b>such</b> as flaps and baffles and <b>behind</b> components <b>such</b> as sharp-edged bends or bell mouths. These disturbances can impair the systems' stability and serviceability.

25|$|The ETIM is an Afghanistan-based {{terrorist}} organization {{and has also}} attacked Pakistan on several occasions. There is a deep sense in both the security officials in Pakistan and China that India {{over the years have}} used such terrorist networks to disrupt Chinese development efforts in the region. Both China and Pakistan believe that India could also use such terrorist networks to sabotage the CPEC project between China and Pakistan. As these militants are labeled as terrorists from the Chinese province of Xinjiang, Pakistan and China strongly believe that India's intelligence services are <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> notorious {{terrorist organization}}s based in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|In some tourist spots {{across the}} island, American brands such as Coca-Cola can be purchased. Ford tankers refuel planes in {{airports}} and some computers use Microsoft software. The {{origin of the}} financing <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> goods is not always clear. The goods often come from third parties based in countries outside the U.S., even if the product being dealt originally has U.S. shareholders or investors. This can be seen, for example, with Nestlé products (which have a 10% US ownership) that can be bought in Cuba with Cuban convertible pesos (CUCs). These CUC pesos are hard currency that are traded in foreign exchange against the US dollar, Euro and other currencies.|$|E

25|$|Sildenafil's {{popularity}} with young adults has {{increased over the}} years. Sildenafil's trade name, Viagra, is widely recognized in popular culture, and the drug's association with treating erectile dysfunction has led to its recreational use. The reasons <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> use include {{the belief that the}} drug increases libido, improves sexual performance, or permanently increases penis size. Studies on the effects of viagra when used recreationally are limited, but suggest it has little effect when used by those not suffering from erectile dysfunction. In one study, a 25-mg dose was shown to cause no significant change in erectile quality, but did reduce the postejaculatory refractory time. This study also noted a significant placebo effect in the control group.|$|E
25|$|The idea <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> emergency-braking {{indicator}} {{systems is}} to catch following drivers' attention with special urgency. However, there remains considerable {{debate over whether}} the system offers a measurable increase in safety performance. To date, studies of vehicles in service have not shown significant improvement. The systems used by BMW, Volvo, and Mercedes differ not only in operational mode (growing vs. intensifying vs. flashing, respectively), but also in such parameters as deceleration threshold of activation. Data are being collected and analyzed {{in an effort to}} determine how such a system might be implemented to maximise a safety benefit, if such a benefit can be realised with visual emergency braking displays. An experimental study at the University of Toronto has tested stop lights which gradually and continuously grow in illuminated area with increasing braking.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the conference}} itself, {{football}} experienced much transition through its history – {{in fact it}} was the main force <b>behind</b> <b>such</b> departures and expansion. In 2003, the BCS announced that it would adjust the automatic bids granted to its six founding conferences based on results from 2004 to 2007. With the addition of Cincinnati, Louisville, and South Florida in 2005, the conference retained its BCS automatic-qualifying status. In 2007, South Florida rose to No. 2 in the BCS rankings, but finished No. 21 in the final poll. Cincinnati finished the 2009 regular season undefeated at 12–0, and ranked No. 3 in the final BCS standings, barely missing the opportunity to play for the BCS National Championship. The conference was 9–7 (.563) in BCS bowl games, the third highest winning percentage amongst the AQ conferences.|$|E
