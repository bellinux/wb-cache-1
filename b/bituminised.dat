One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the <b>bituminised</b> matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the <b>bituminised</b> matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of <b>bituminised</b> medium-level waste. When the <b>bituminised</b> matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level <b>bituminised</b> waste very challenging.|$|E

50|$|North Coast tourist {{development}} was fostered by substantial {{improvements to the}} region's road transport network during the interwar period.

With improved access for visitors from Brisbane, it was not unusual to see 600 or 700 cars parked on Caloundra's foreshores. Building activity reflected this popularity and included: a new subdivision of housing allotments at Moffat Head; the Amusu picture theatre (1935) in Bulcock Street; the Kings Beach Bathing Pavilion with kiosk and changing sheds (1937); the Queensland Governor's Curramundi House at Dicky Beach (1936); and the Semloh, cafe, store and guesthouse (...)

40|$|Managing {{radioactive}} waste must {{be carried out}} within a strict framework and with a constant requirement to protect human beings and the environment. A safety management of the radioactive material or waste (RAM or RW) unavoidably involves transportation activities by using robust safe and reliable packaging system. The integrity is a crucial aspect in the design of these systems; to certify it packages should demonstrate to withstand loads, that could occur under normal and accident conditions, and to meet the safety requirements in terms of performances of containment and radiation protection, like the IAEA ones. This study deals with the thermal performances of an Italian CP 5. 2 packaging system aimed at the transportation of <b>bituminised</b> wastes, which have been evaluated by executing experimental tests in the fire scenario as specified in the IAEA regulations (i. e. engulfing fire of 800 °C for 30 minutes). To the purpose a dedicated small scale mock-up has been designed and built at the Dept. DICI of the University of Pisa. The experimental test allowed to set up the test procedure to be adopted for the fire tests of a large scale system in consideration of risk related to the stowed <b>bituminised</b> wastes. The results of the thermal test are presented and discussed. Analysing them it is possible to conclude that the overall integrity of the packaging system is assured...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} programme involving osmotic and matric suction controlled {{tests is}} carried out to investigate the effects of increasing pore fluid concentration, chemical cycling (salinisation/dilution) and matric suction on the liquid retention properties, shear strength and volume change behaviour of Boom Clay. This Tertiary Clay formation has been thoroughly investigated as a possible host material for the disposal of Eurobitum <b>bituminised</b> radioactive waste (BW) in Belgium. Within this context chemical impact and partially saturated conditions are studied in a combined way to cover {{a wide range of}} in-situ states induced by underground construction, ventilation and diffusion of a large amount of sodium nitrate (NaNO 3) (contained in the <b>bituminised</b> waste). Statically compacted specimens are prepared at different sodium nitrate concentrations or are exposed, at constant vertical stress, to sodium nitrate salinisation or pore water dilution. An aggregated structure with a double porosity network is induced on salinisation and subsequent compaction even at high water contents. An increase in pore fluid concentration enhances the aggregation of the microstructure and reduces the liquid retention properties of the material. Results of oedometer tests performed under constant matric suction and increasing osmotic suction show shrinkage of the sample, a decrease of the compressibility and an increase in the preconsolidation stress. Shear strength results have been interpreted using a single constitutive stress (average skeleton stress) to take into account matric suction and chemical effects on degree of saturation and on microstructural changes. A unique linear shear strength failure envelope has been obtained for the tests performed at different osmotic and matric suctions. The modification of the liquid retention behaviour of the material induced by salinisation {{has proven to be a}} crucial aspect for the interpretation of the obtained results.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} evaluation of the thermal conductivity of a concrete matrix {{to be used for}} embedding LILW <b>bituminised</b> Wastes into the packaging system. Such a type of packaging, identified with the acronym CP 5. 2, has been also qualified by executing at the Lab. Scalbatraio of Dep. of Civil and Industrial Engineering of the University of Pisa, an experimental test campaign accordingly to the IAEA regulations. In particular, the knowledge of the thermal conductivity is important because of the fire or furnace test to carry out in oven at 800 °C for 30 minutes. These data allowed to simulate pretest conditions and to set up safety and operational fire test procedures. The concrete thermal conductivity was obtained by performing hot wire tests on cylindrical concrete samples for temperatures ranging from 100 ° to about 800 °C. Thermal conductivity is determined at steady state condition. Results indicate a monotonically reduction of the thermal conductivity as the temperature increases. The comparison with concrete thermal conductivity data available in literature indicates a quite good agreement. Finally, visual and X-ray inspection of sample did not highlight the presence of micro/macro damages that would have affected the thermal performance of the concrete under study...|$|E
