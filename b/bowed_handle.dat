5000|$|In tournaments, {{compound}} archers usually equip their bows with a sighting system, {{consisting of}} a [...] "peep sight" [...] held within the bowstring {{that acts as a}} back sight, and a front sight attached to the <b>bow</b> <b>handle.</b> Some front sights are magnifying and/or adjustable for targets at different distances. Some sights have multiple [...] "pins" [...] set up for targets at different distances.|$|R
50|$|One {{traditional}} {{method of}} manufacture {{is the use of}} bow drills made with hard white quartz points for drilling sacred objects from stone. One technique uses moistened rawhide strips rolled in crushed white quartz and stretched with a <b>bow</b> <b>handle</b> to shape and rough the pipes. Pipe bowls may also be shaped with hard sandstones, then polished with water and sanded with progressively finer and finer abrasive grit and animal hide, finally being rubbed with fat or other oils to complete polishing.|$|R

50|$|This is a beaker-shaped {{container}} with three hollow, pointed legs. It has a plain <b>bow</b> <b>handle</b> and two capped uprights. This jia {{is one of}} the most elegant of the Middle Shang period. The decoration, mainly in thread relief, consists of two bands both framed by small continuous circles - typical for the period. The lower band is divided into six panels by thick and shallow ridges. Every other ridge forms the central part of a taotie face with two bulging eyes. This mask is formed by the dissolved bodies of two confronted dragons in profile. The upper band above the constricted waist is a smaller, narrower and eye-less version of the same theme. The short uprights spring upwards from the rim of the flowing mouth. Set at right angles with the handle, they occupy the segment of the rim the farther away from this handle, which is another characteristic of the Middle Shang style. The nipple-like caps arc incised with whorl-circles, the only dynamic elements in an otherwise frontal and static decoration.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the spread}} of firearms, use of the bow persisted {{throughout}} the 18th century due to its superior build quality and ease of <b>handling.</b> <b>Bows</b> were widely used by the rebels during the Indian rebellion of 1857.|$|R

40|$|AbstractSkill in archery {{directly}} {{depends on}} {{the interaction between the}} subject, the bow and the arrow when shooting. Researches in biomechanics of archery have frequently described the different coordination and muscular activation during the shoot of the subject. Few of them describe the influence of the bow (mechanical characteristics, stabilizers, etc.) on the subject’s skill and physical capacities. The aim of the study is to compare the influence of two bows on the subject’s skill. An international level archer shot a sequence of twelve arrows (A 1) X 10, 380 (Easton) and a sequence of twelve arrows (A 2) X 10 Pro Tour, 380 (Easton). Each sequence of arrows were shot with two bows (B 1 : 27 inch Inno carbon <b>bow</b> <b>handle</b> associated with 70 inch and 38 lb bow limb; B 2 : 25 inch Inno <b>bow</b> carbon <b>handle</b> associated with 70 inch and 40 lb bow limb). All archers’ shots were performed on a 70  m distant target. For each arrow, heights at shot (H 1) and on the target (H 2) were measured. The velocity (km. h− 1) of the arrow was recorded using Stalker ATS radar when it left the bow. The angle (α) between the arrow and the horizontal axis was estimated using the previous measurement and the Newton’s law. Multi-varied Anova test was used to define the influence of bows and arrows on the shot parameter (V) and archer’s skill (α, H 2). Results show that the use of the B 2 A 2 condition would be the less interesting for this archer’s skill in order to perform the centre of the target. Indeed, H 2 with B 2 A 2 condition is usually 10 cm above the centre of the target. The use of the B 2 A 1 condition could permit the archer to perform the centre of the target as accurately as the B 1 conditions. When using B 2 A 1 condition, a shot is realised with smaller velocity (219 ± 0. 3 versus 226 ± 0  km. h− 1) and bigger angle α (5. 45 ± 0. 3 versus 5. 16 ± 0. 03 degree). For this archer, B 2 A 1 condition could help him to reach the centre of the target with less energy to bend the bow and shoot with less velocity, and bigger range of angle when shooting (0. 6 versus 0. 08 degree) ...|$|R
40|$|Automatic text {{categorization}} (also {{known as}} text classification or topic spotting) is {{the activity of}} labeling natural language texts with thematic categories from a predefined set. For the purpose of classifying the text documents, {{there is a need}} for a set of features and a weighting model which gives relevance value to the features. Currently, bag of words(BOW) is found to be the most widely accepted text representation method. This representation has two major drawbacks. First, the amount of features is very large; second, there is no relatedness between the words. Topic Detection (TD) technique helps the <b>BOW</b> to <b>handle</b> the two drawbacks by detection features very relevant to the document in the space of concept. However, existing TD techniques were not designed for text categorization an...|$|R

50|$|Elms, hickory and ash {{all have}} remarkably hard, tough wood {{that has made}} them popular for things like tool <b>handles,</b> <b>bows</b> and {{baseball}} bats. Chinese elm is considered the hardest of the elms. Owing to its superior hardness, toughness and resistance to splitting, Chinese elm {{is said to be}} the best of all woods for chisel handles and similar uses. Chinese elm lumber is used most for furniture, cabinets, veneer and hardwood flooring, as well as specialty uses such as long bow construction and tool handles. Most of the commercially milled lumber goes directly to manufacturers rather than to retail lumber outlets.|$|R
60|$|Moreover, in London I {{had heard}} much talk of armies and their {{ordering}} and often watched troops at their exercise; also I {{know how to}} <b>handle</b> <b>bow</b> and sword, and was accustomed to the management of men. So putting all these memories together, I set myself {{to the task of}} turning a mob of half-savage fellows with arms into an ordered host. I created regiments and officered them with the best captains that I could find, collecting in each regiment so far as possible the people of a certain town or district. These companies I drilled and exercised, teaching them to use such weapons as they had to the best purpose.|$|R
50|$|The wood {{economy is}} {{historically}} {{the starting point}} of the civilizations worldwide, since eras preceding the Paleolithic and the Neolithic. It necessarily preceded ages of metals by many centuries, as the melting of metals was possible only through the discovery of techniques to light fire (usually obtained by the scraping of two very dry wooden rods) and the building of many simple machines and rudimentary tools, as canes, club <b>handles,</b> <b>bows,</b> arrows, lances. One of the most ancient handmade articles ever found is one smoothed pricked of wood (Clacton Spear) 250,000 years old (third interglacial period), that was buried under sediments in England, at Clacton-on-Sea.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Typically, in textual {{document}} classification {{the documents}} {{are represented in}} the vector space using the “Bag of Words ” (BOW) approach. Despite its ease of use, <b>BOW</b> representation cannot <b>handle</b> word synonymy and polysemy problems and does not consider semantic relatedness between words. In this paper, we overcome the shortages of the BOW approach by embedding a known WordNet-based semantic relatedness measure for pairs of words, namely Omiotis, into a semantic kernel. The suggested measure incorporates the TF-IDF weighting scheme, thus creating a semantic kernel which combines both semantic and statistical information from text. Empirical evaluation with real data sets demonstrates that our approach successfully achieves improved classification accuracy {{with respect to the}} standard BOW representation, when Omiotis is embedded in four different classifiers...|$|R
40|$|The {{addition}} of polymer dielectric films to silicon wafers {{is useful in}} producing stress reduction layers and interconnect structures for chip-scale packaging as well as 3 D wafer stacks. The use of lower cure temperature materials offers several advantages including a lowered thermal budget on devices that are sensitive to electrical performance change with temperature. Unfortunately, enough stress remains from {{the difference in the}} coefficients of thermal expansion of the polymer and the silicon to cause significant wafer <b>bow</b> and <b>handling</b> problems. This warpage problem increases as the wafers are thinned for 3 D stacking, TSV, or are used in embedded system packaging. This work describes substantial stress and warpage reduction of positive- and negative-acting photo-dielectric films from JSR Micro, Inc [...] Multi-step cure profiles using variable frequency microwaves (VFM) that include low temperature steps and very fast ramps were evaluated with statistical designs. The same materials were cured to the same extent (as measured by TMA and solvent resistance) using a standard convection oven for comparison. Large reductions of wafer warpage does not {{come at the expense of}} longer processing times but just the opposite. Substantially lowered cure temperatures and much faster cycle times are reported for these films. The results are discussed in terms of molecular and bulk curing mechanisms...|$|R
50|$|Scissors are {{hand-operated}} shearing tools. They {{consist of}} a pair of metal blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the <b>handles</b> (<b>bows)</b> opposite to the pivot are closed. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, cloth, rope, and wire. A large variety of scissors and shears all exist for specialized purposes. Hair-cutting shears and kitchen shears are functionally equivalent to scissors, but the larger implements tend to be called shears. Hair-cutting shears have specific blade angles ideal for cutting hair. Using the incorrect scissors to cut hair will result in increased damage or split ends, or both, by breaking the hair. Kitchen shears, also known as kitchen scissors, are intended for cutting and trimming foods such as meats.|$|R
50|$|The {{resilience}} and rapid growth {{made it an}} important resource for smallholders and farmers. It {{was probably the most}} versatile wood in the countryside with wide-ranging uses. Until World War II the trees were often coppiced on a ten-year cycle to provide a sustainable source of timber for fuel and poles for building and woodworking. The colour of the wood ranges from creamy white to light brown, and the heart wood may be a darker olive-brown. Ash timber is hard, tough and very hard-wearing, with a coarse open grain and a density of 710 kg/m3. It lacks oak's natural resistance to decay, and is not as suitable for posts buried in the ground. Because of its high flexibility, shock-resistance and resistance to splitting, ash wood is the traditional material for <b>bows,</b> tool <b>handles,</b> especially for hammers and axes, tennis rackets and snooker cue sticks and it was extensively used in the construction of early aircraft. Ash was commonly used green for making chair frames which would be seated with another timber or with woven rush (e.g. those made by Philip Clissett, see also The English Regional Chair). The parts were turned on a pole lathe or shaped with a drawknife. The practice essentially died out in the early 20th century, but has seen a revival in recent years.|$|R
5000|$|Hickory wood is very hard, stiff, {{dense and}} shock resistant. There are woods that are {{stronger}} than hickory and woods that are harder, but the combination of strength, toughness, hardness and stiffness found in hickory wood is not found in any other commercial wood.

Paddles are often made from hickory. This property of hickory wood has left a trace in some Native American languages: in Ojibwe, hickory is called [...] "mitigwaabaak", a compound of mitigwaab [...] "bow" [...] and the final -aakw [...] "hardwood tree" ...|$|R

40|$|Sheep wool is {{an ancient}} {{material}} of exceptional natural properties and has some advantages over synthetic materials that are widespread used, beside {{the impact on the}} environment {{is becoming more and more}} problematic. For this reason, knowledge about the wool in the kindergartens seems even more important. That way child can connect with the nature and the environment and can produce numerous useful products that wool technology allows. Because the usage of the wool is very broad, we believe it is very important for children in kindergarten to learn the wool harvest procedure and other wool related technological procedures. The goal of this thesis is to present the variety of activities with the sheep’s wool and to motivate other kindergartens to use this material. The problem is unfamiliarity with the material itself. In the theoretical part we introduce the wool processing and wool treatment, followed by introduction of different techniques and technologies that we can use in kindergarten. We also wrote a baseline of child development and games. The children showed great interest for the activities. We continued with dry felting making brooches which included felting with the needle. When children mastered wool handling each of them made a product on their own. Some help was necessary with young children, like making a <b>bow</b> tie and <b>handling</b> a needle. Wet felting proved to be the favourite activity for the children. With teacher's guidance they were able to make a product (felt-drawing). All products have been quality constructed. Children did pay attention to details like transparent parts which they connected with the wool on the base layer. Weaving proved to be more difficult for younger children. Children were able to detect possible problems with the yarn and the sticks and were able to fix it themselves. Younger children were not able to weave on their own yet. They were more interested in the process itself, than the product. With this kind of material children dealt the first time when making a bottom part of the handbags. The activity making a toy was done on their own as well. It proved that sewing a toy was not a difficulty. Proper environment, quiet space was all that children needed. The activity was implemented only with older children. Everyone was able to cut and sew. Filling up the toy with wool to stand upright proved to be more challenging. After trying out some options, most children have succeeded. During the activity children were persistent, accurate doing the fine work, creative, and overall most products were finished and put up on exhibition. The activity itself, material and technology all together proved to be suitable for creative activities in the kindergarten. ...|$|R
