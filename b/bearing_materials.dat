50|$|Although {{bearings}} tend to {{wear out}} with use, designers can make tradeoffs of bearing size and cost versus lifetime. A bearing can last indefinitely—longer {{than the rest of}} the machine—if it is kept cool, clean, lubricated, is run within the rated load, and if the <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> are sufficiently free of microscopic defects. Note that cooling, lubrication, and sealing are thus important parts of the bearing design.|$|E

The lixiviant solution conditions vary in terms of pH, oxidation-reduction potential, presence of chelating agents and temperature, to optimize the rate, extent and selectivity of dissolution of the desired metal component into the aqueous phase. Through the use of chelating agents, one can selectively extract certain metals. Such chelating agents are typically amines of schiff bases.|$|E

A similar idea was the swashplate engine, an axial form of cam engine. Although the forces in a cam engine are often greater and the frictional losses are high, they can also allow the use of larger bearing surfaces than a conventional crankshaft. Before the development of high performance <b>bearing</b> <b>materials,</b> the cam and swashplate engines appeared to offer some advantages.|$|E

Black silicon nitride ceramic is superior to white zirconium dioxide ceramic, since it is considerably harder and tougher. At the modest rotational speeds encountered in skates, manufacturer data suggests negligible difference in friction performance between the various <b>bearing</b> <b>materials.</b> At these speeds, ball bearing friction tends {{to be dominated by}} seals and lubricants.|$|E
50|$|Kingsbury {{received}} his mechanical engineering degree from Cornell University in 1887. It was at Cornell {{that he met}} Professor Robert Henry Thurston. Professor Thurston was instrumental in shaping Kingsbury’s interest in bearings and tribology. Working under Professor Thurston, Kingsbury conducted tests on <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> for the Pennsylvania Railroad. His craftsmanship, honed by his experience in machine shops, allowed Kingsbury to fit half-bushings to the journal by scraping. His hand fitting produced the small tolerances that promoted film lubrication. These bearings, when ran showed no measurable signs of wear, and was Kingsbury’s prompt {{to the creation of}} the thrust bearings which now bear his name.|$|E
5000|$|The graphs of {{friction}} force reported by Stribeck {{stem from a}} carefully conducted, wide-ranging series of experiments on journal bearings. Stribeck systematically studied the variation {{of friction}} between two liquid lubricated surfaces. His results were presented on 5 December 1901 during a public session of the railway society and published on 6 September 1902. They clearly showed the minimum value of friction as the demarcation between full fluid-film lubrication and some solid asperity interactions. Stribeck studied different <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> and aspect ratios D/L from 1:1 to 1:2. The maximum sliding speed was 4 m/s and the geometrical contact pressure was limited to 5 MPa. (These operating conditions were related to railway wagon journal bearings.) ...|$|E
50|$|One {{advantage}} is that the bearing surface area can be larger than for a crankshaft.

40|$|The wear of {{polymeric}} <b>bearing</b> <b>material</b> {{in contact}} with metallic biomedical implant has often been {{the main cause of}} long-term clinical failure of such implants.

This research paper presents an investigation on the wear properties of UHMWPE under dry and wet sliding conditions at different loading conditions. In this study, the well-known pin-on-disk equipment was used to carry out the sliding wear test. The titanium pin was made by Electron Beam Melting (EBM) technology and machined to rub on the UHMWPE disk. The aim is to understand the wear characteristics of UHMWPE in relation to Ti 6 Al 4 V alloy under various loading and lubricating conditions. Results include volume loss and wear rate analysis...|$|R
50|$|Anion {{exchange}} separation {{methods are}} widely used in the purification of actinides and actinide <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> {{through the use of}} resin columns. The anionic actinide complexes are retained by anion exchange sites that are on the resin and neutral species pass through the column unretained. Then the retained species can be eluted from the column by conversion to a neutral complex, typically by changing the mobile phase passed through the resin bed. Anion exchange-based separations of actinides, while valued for there simplicity and widely used, tend to be time consuming and are infrequently automated. Most are still dependent on gravity. Speeding up the flow of the mobile phase tends to introduce problems such as impurities and jeopardize future investigations. Hence, there is still a need for development of this technique to satisfy the nuclear forensic research priorities.|$|E
50|$|In 1984 a bismuth alloy {{supplied}} by the plant to a company in Germany {{was found to be}} radioactive: alpha radiation was found to be emitted by -products of the smelting process due to the presence of polonium 210 (a radioisotope with a half life of about 140 days), thought to be produced via radioactive decay of naturally occurring isotopes in tin-bearing ore bodies such as granite. The plant was subsequently licensed to emit 592 MBq (16 mCu) (1985) and typically emitted less than 10% of that amount, less than background radiation. Most (about 95%) of the polonium <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> and radioactivity were confined to the factory, {{as a result of the}} high temperature smelting process causing it to volatalise and condense within the plant. The plant's polonium emissions license did not become public knowledge until over two years after it was given.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} usual {{limits to the}} {{lifetime}} or load capacity of a bearing: abrasion, fatigue and pressure-induced welding. Abrasion occurs when the surface is eroded by hard contaminants scraping at the <b>bearing</b> <b>materials.</b> Fatigue results when a material becomes brittle after being repeatedly loaded and released. Where the ball or roller touches the race there is always some deformation, and hence a risk of fatigue. Smaller balls or rollers deform more sharply, and so tend to fatigue faster. Pressure-induced welding can occur when two metal pieces are pressed together at very high pressure and they become one. Although balls, rollers and races may look smooth, they are microscopically rough. Thus, there are high-pressure spots which push away the bearing lubricant. Sometimes, the resulting metal-to-metal contact welds a microscopic part of the ball or roller to the race. As the bearing continues to rotate, the weld is then torn apart, but it may leave race welded to bearing or bearing welded to race.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principal}} function of Plant 2/3 was uranium purification and conversion of uranium <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> into uranium trioxide (UO3), or orange oxide. There are three principal forms of uranium residues, each having a separate processing route for putting the uranium into solution. Uranium oxides are dissolved in 6000 gallon vats of pure nitric acid in the Oxide Digester (also {{known as the}} west metal dissolver), miscellaneous residues that required filtration were dissolved in the Slag Leach Digester, and metals were dissolved in the Metal Dissolver. If the ore was poured too rapidly into the nitric acid vats a condition known as a [...] "boilover" [...] results. The reaction generates so much gas that it becomes a foam and boils over {{the sides of the}} vat. Many workers were told to not step in any puddles on the floor as they were probably nitric acid left from one of these [...] "boilover" [...] incidents. The site employed their own cobblers just to repair work boots that had been exposed to too much acid. Another hazard was the nitrogen dioxide fumes coming off the nitric acid vats. There were so many fumes that on high humidity days during the summer there appeared to be an orange cloud encasing this building and anyone just walking past would experience a sensation as if he had wandered into a swarm of bees.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Copper, {{aluminum}} and tin–lead based alloys {{are widely used}} as journal <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> in tri-bological applications. Bronze and brass are widely used as journal <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> for copper based alloys.

In addition, white metals are widely used as journal <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> for tin–lead based alloys. These alloys ensure properties expected from journal bearings. In this study, tribological and mechanical properties of these journal bearings manufactured by metals were investigated. SAE 1050 steel shaft was used as counter abrader.

40|$|Traditional <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> contain {{different}} {{amounts of}} lead (Pb) {{because of its}} friction reducing properties. However, {{in view of the}} negative health and environmental impact of Pb, there is growing emphasis on restricting the usage of Pb in engine bearings. Owing to this, new <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> that provide at least comparable tribological performance to that of Pb containing alloys are being developed and some new Pb-free materials are being already used in engine bearing applications. It is, however, still unclear how these newengine <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> would perform in mixed and boundary lubricated conditions. In this study, a block-on-ring test setup was employed to investigate the tribological performance of several bimetal and multi-layer Pb-free <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> with different compositions of bearing lining and overlay plating. Pb-containing bearing material was also studied as a reference material. Friction and wear properties of these <b>bearing</b> <b>materials</b> wereinvestigated and their wear mechanisms under lubricated conditions have been analysed. Bearing material with overlay of Polyamide-Imide with graphite and MoS 2 exhibited better friction and wear properties than Pb-based and Al-Sn based materials. Pb-containg bearing material shows higher wear and Al-Sn based material has shown higher friction. Godkänd; 2014; 20140619 (andbra...|$|E
