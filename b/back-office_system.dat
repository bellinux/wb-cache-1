40|$|The European Union Reference Laboratory for the {{detection}} of animal proteins in feedingstuffs (EURL-AP) has developed an online micrographs collection supporting its network activities within the European Union for {{the detection}} of prohibited animal by-products in feed. So far, the only official method for detecting these by-products is light microscopy, which is highly dependent on the skills of a microscopist because it relies on particle recognition. In order to help the microscopist network to achieve high proficiency levels, it was necessary to create an online reference tool based on micrographs and accessible via an Intranet platform. Members of the National Reference Laboratories for animal proteins in feedingstuffs (NRL-AP) and the International Association for Feedingstuff Analysis – Section Feedingstuff Microscopy (IAG) have access to this micrographs collection.

Moreover, in order to assess the impact of the additional demand of inductive charging on the grid operation, an estimation of the 24 -hour power profile of dynamic inductive charging is presented considering, apart from the road traffic, the probability of the need for fast charging, as well as the specifications of the proposed solution. In addition, an energy management system is presented enabling the management of the operation of the inductive charging infrastructure, the interaction with the EV users and the provision of demand response services to different stakeholders. The proposed dynamic inductive charging approach has been demonstrated within a real urban environment in order to provide useful insights regarding the experience gained from a real-field trial. The relevant practical conclusions are also discussed in this paper. Finally, a cost/benefit analysis, according to the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) principles, is performed in order to assess the economic viability of the proposed solution.

40|$|The British Geological Survey (BGS) {{receives}} 10 000 requests {{each year}} for copies of records held in the National Geoscience Data Centre (NGDC) collections. Public, academic and commercial users have {{for a number of}} years been able to access the indexes for these collections online through the Geoindex on the BGS website but when requesting copies, have had to revert to traditional phone, email and faxed orders. In 2007, however, following extensive user testing, the BGS introduced a new online service called GeoRecords alongside its existing online shops ([URL] GeoRecords enables users to search, using a web GIS application, the index of borehole records held in the NGDC (over 1. 2 million individual borehole records) and then to order them online. Orders are then passed automatically to a digital <b>back-office</b> <b>system</b> which BGS Enquiry Service staff use to track the orders and access the digital record scans. This has resulted in a significant improvement of efficiency to the benefit of both users and the BGS alike. An innovative ‘traffic light scoring’ feature in the GeoRecords back-office also enables the BGS Enquiry Service staff to quality check each scanned record during processing of the order. The results of this on-the-fly checking, of up to 40 000 individual records each year, are fed back to records management staff to enable continued improvements in the knowledge of and quality of the NGDC collections. This paper will show you how the GeoRecords system operates and how we hope it can be expanded (for example with online payment and online delivery of records) with the aim of further improving access to and exploitation of the National Geoscience Data Centre collections. ...|$|E
40|$|Vehicle uptime {{is getting}} {{increasingly}} {{important as the}} transport solutions become more complex and the transport industry seeks new ways of being competitive. Traditional Fleet Management Systems are gradually extended with new features to improve reliability, such as better maintenance planning. Typical diagnostic and predictive maintenance methods require extensive experimentation and modelling during development. This is unfeasible if the complete vehicle is addressed as it would require too much engineering resources. This thesis investigates unsupervised and supervised methods for predicting vehicle maintenance. The methods are data driven and use extensive amounts of data, either streamed, on-board data or historic and aggregated data from off-board databases. The methods rely on a telematics gateway that enables vehicles to communicate with a <b>back-office</b> <b>system.</b> Data representations, either aggregations or models, are sent wirelessly to an off-board system which analyses the data for deviations. These are later associated to the repair history and form a knowledge base {{that can be used}} to predict upcoming failures on other vehicles that show the same deviations. The thesis further investigates different ways of doing data representations and deviation detection. The first one presented, COSMO, is an unsupervised and self-organised approach demonstrated on a fleet of city buses. It automatically comes up with the most interesting on-board data representations and uses a consensus based approach to isolate the deviating vehicle. The second approach outlined is a super-vised classification based on earlier collected and aggregated vehicle statistics in which the repair history is used to label the usage statistics. A classifier is trained to learn patterns in the usage data that precede specific repairs and thus can be used to predict vehicle maintenance. This method is demonstrated for failures of the vehicle air compressor and based on AB Volvo’s database of vehicle usage statistics...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, 2006. This is a {{quantitative}} study {{that focuses on}} the lack of differentiation within the forecourt convenience store industry within Cape Town area and the use of an information system to build a differentiation strategy for major oil companies. A critical literature review was conducted to provide a theoretical framework for this study. The literature provided a foundation for the study and revealed that previous researchers have found that it is vital to differentiate within the retail industry due to the highly competitive nature of the industry. It was also made evident in the literature that companies need to become knowledgeable about the customer, the store attributes and products that can contribute to developing a differentiation strategy. Previous researchers recognized the value of having a robust information system that can provide key information required for the strategic planning process of retail companies. The literature review assisted in placing this study in context and preparing for the collection of primary data to answer the research questions. The Chevron retailers within the Cape Town area participated in the study and responded to a questionnaire that focused on the value of differentiation and information systems within the convenience store industry and the subsequent effect it has on the profitability and brand equity of a company. The survey strategy was chosen as the most applicable research method and the findings from the analysis of the data shows that the retailers are in strong agreement that differentiation will enable an oil company to rise above the competitors within the forecourt convenience store industry and also agreed that an information system is required to provide the critical information to assist in developing a differentiation strategy. There appears to be a strong positive correlation between differentiating and an information system from the responses received from the sample of retailers. From the synthesis of the results the most important factors {{that can be used to}} differentiate in the industry are store location and customer service. It was also found that the information system must contain data on customers, store attributes and products. This is seen as important ingredients for the strategic planning process and this information will ultimately contribute to an increase in profitability and brand equity if used appropriately. The recommendations made to an oil company that operates within the forecourt convenience store industry are to focus on strategic store locations and customer service to increase profitability and brand equity. Additionally a <b>back-office</b> <b>system</b> must be implemented that enables the capture of pertinent customer, store and product information. It was also recommended that a further study be undertaken using qualitative data gathering techniques and the scope to include the entire convenience store industry in South Africa...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with inter-organisational information systems (IS) in e-government. Inter-organisational IS are usually considered to establish information exchange between public agencies. However, there may also exist other types of inter-organisational e-government. Different public agencies can cooperate on shared digital resources of diverse kinds (shared websites, shared IT components, shared <b>back-office</b> <b>systems).</b> This paper develops a conceptual framework on four different types of inter-organisational e-government.

However, {{the formation of}} Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank (DKB) in 1971 dethroned Fuji from its top status in the Japanese banking industry. In an attempt to restore its preeminence, Fuji agreed to merge with Osaka-based Sanwa Bank in the late 1970s, but failed to win approval from the Ministry of Finance. Sumitomo Bank also rose as an intense competitor to Fuji in the 1980s, and both banks aggressively courted similar corporate banking clients, growing their loan portfolios dramatically with what would later become non-performing loans.

40|$|Abstract- Electronic {{commerce}} {{involves a}} wide range of activities. The goal of electronic commerce is to improve the way in which business is conducted, through technology. This could be as simple as establishing a computer-mediated relationship between consumer and business, between business and supplier, or between supplier and manufacturer. It could involve automation of existing business systems, such as transaction or manufacturing processes. On the web, electronic commerce often means marketing, and online sales. Behind this though is a vast range of activities and technologies, powered by <b>back-office</b> <b>systems.</b> Electronic commerce is more than just sales. Initially, the Indian banking system was domestically oriented at the time of nationalization in 1969. National policy objectives where the guiding force and banks were primarily involved in mobilizing domestic savings, lending funds to specific sectors of the economy and raising resources for financing public deficits. Technology in Indian banking has evolved substantially from the days of back office automation today's online, centralized and integrated solutions. Once cannot think of ATM, Internet, mobile and phone banking or call centre services without the help of technology? However, the irony is that most of those products have more of technology and less of banking. Let us look of how banking has changed as a business over the last one decade.

During {{the course of}} the project, ADP interviewed over 200 CGIAR employees across all 15 Centres, visited 13 CGIAR locations across 5 continents, gathered financial data from all Centres and engaged with key leadership across the Alliance Office, corporate services and research. Leveraging leading practices from Accenture’s shared service practice and relevant experiences across the non-profit sector, ADP has found significant opportunities for shared services to improve the current operations of the CGIAR as well as to improve the position of the CGIAR for future opportunities. ADP developed a target operating model covering the use of shared services across all Centre functions and recommended seven key opportunities to focus preliminary shared service activities. The seven key shared service opportunity areas are: 1. Develop and Expand Research Support Services, 2. Standardised Ways of Working, 3. Rationalise <b>Back-office</b> <b>Systems,</b> 4. Share HR Functions, 5. Procurement and Leveraged Buying, 6. Share IT, and 7. Share / Rationalize Physical Facilities and Facility Support. The target operating model and key opportunities were reviewed by a broad cross-section of finance, IT and research leadership, and general consensus was achieved. Across the seven opportunities, ADP developed business cases, implementation roadmaps and location strategies to allow the CGIAR to effectively prioritize shared service efforts and to help align shared services with other CGIAR strategic initiatives.
