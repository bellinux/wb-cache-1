5|$|Subsequent authors {{moved the}} {{blacktip reef shark}} to the genus Carcharhinus; in 1965 the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature {{designated}} it as the type species for the genus. In some earlier literature, the scientific name of this shark was mistakenly given as C. spallanzani, now recognized as a synonym of the spottail shark (C. sorrah). Other common names for this species include <b>blackfin</b> reef shark, black-finned shark, blacktip shark, reef blacktip shark, and guliman.|$|E
25|$|The highly {{migratory species}} include: tuna and tuna-like species (albacore, Atlantic bluefin, bigeye tuna, skipjack, yellowfin, <b>blackfin,</b> little tunny, Pacific bluefin, {{southern}} bluefin and bullet), pomfret, marlin, sailfish, swordfish, saury and oceangoing sharks, dolphins and other cetaceans.|$|E
25|$|RISC ISAs include ARC, Alpha, Am29000, ARM, Atmel AVR, <b>Blackfin,</b> i860, i960, M88000, MIPS, PA-RISC, Power ISA (including PowerPC), RISC-V, SuperH, and SPARC. In the 21st century, {{the use of}} ARM {{architecture}} processors in smartphones and {{tablet computers}} such as the iPad and Android devices provided a wide user base for RISC-based systems. RISC processors are also used in supercomputers such as the K computer, the fastest on the TOP500 list in 2011, second at the 2012 list, and fourth at the 2013 list, and Sequoia, the fastest in 2012 and third in the 2013 list.|$|E
500|$|The blacktip shark {{was first}} {{described}} by French zoologist Achille Valenciennes as Carcharias (Prionodon) limbatus in Johannes Müller and Friedrich Henle's 1839 Systematische Beschreibung der Plagiostomen. The type specimens were two individuals caught off Martinique, {{both of which}} have since been lost. Later authors moved this species to the genus Carcharhinus. The specific epithet limbatus is Latin for [...] "bordered", referring to the black edges of this shark's fins. Other common names used for the blacktip shark include <b>blackfin</b> shark, blacktip whaler, common or small blacktip shark, grey shark, and spotfin ground shark.|$|E

50|$|Memory Protection Unit: All <b>Blackfin</b> {{processors}} {{contain a}} Memory Protection Unit (MPU). The MPU provides protection and caching strategies {{across the entire}} memory space. The MPU allows <b>Blackfin</b> to support operating systems, RTOSs and kernels like ThreadX, µC/OS-II, or NOMMU Linux. Although the MPU {{is referred to as}} a Memory Management Unit (MMU) in the <b>Blackfin</b> documentation, the <b>Blackfin</b> MPU does not provide address translation like a traditional MMU, so it does not support virtual memory or separate memory addresses per process. This is why <b>Blackfin</b> currently can not support operating systems requiring virtual memory such as WinCE or QNX.|$|E

50|$|<b>Blackfin</b> {{processors}} {{support a}} variety of external memories including SDRAM, DDR-SDRAM, NOR flash, NAND flash and SRAM. Some <b>Blackfin</b> processors also include mass-storage interfaces such as ATAPI and SD/SDIO. They can support hundreds of megabytes of memory in the external memory space.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Blackfin</b> uses a byte-addressable, flat memory map.

50|$|The <b>Blackfin</b> is {{a family}} of 16- or 32-bit {{microprocessors}} developed, manufactured and marketed by Analog Devices. The processors have built-in, fixed-point digital signal processor (DSP) functionality supplied by 16-bit Multiply-accumulates (MACs), accompanied on-chip by a small microcontroller. It was designed for a unified low-power processor architecture that can run operating systems while simultaneously handling complex numeric tasks such as real-time H.264 video encoding. There are several hardware development kits for the <b>Blackfin.</b> Open-source operating systems for the <b>Blackfin</b> include uClinux.|$|E
