5|$|In July 2014, the Detroit Lions {{announced}} that June would join their staff {{as one of}} four <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh</b> Minority Fellowship Interns, but June coached Anacostia to a 48 record in 2014.|$|E
50|$|The 1994 Stanford Cardinal {{football}} team represented Stanford University in the 1994 NCAA Division I-A football season. The Cardinal {{played in the}} Pacific-10 Conference. After back-to-back disappointing seasons, this was <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> last season as Stanford's head coach.|$|R
50|$|The 1980 San Francisco 49ers {{season was}} the team's 31st in the National Football League. This was both <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> and Joe Montana's second {{season with the}} team. The 49ers looked to improve on their {{previous}} output of 2-14 (which they had earned in both of the two previous seasons). They {{failed to make the}} playoffs for the eighth consecutive season, but they did improve to 6-10.|$|R
50|$|Football {{historians have}} {{attributed}} {{the naming of}} Walsh’s offensive scheme to head coach Bill Parcells after his New York Giants clobbered the 49ers in a 1985 playoff game and Parcells mockingly asked “So {{what do you think}} of that West Coast Offense now?” Whatever it was called, <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh’s</b> West Coast Offense was still nothing more than a few disjointed sketches on a legal pad when Jack Neumeier had a team on the field utilizing the spread offense.|$|R
5|$|Four 49ers coaches—Dick Nolan, <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh,</b> George Seifert, and Jim Harbaugh—have {{been named}} {{coach of the}} year by at least one major news organization. Walsh, Jack Christiansen and Mike Singletary are the only 49ers coaches {{currently}} in the Pro Football Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|Youngblood, in 1987, {{was voted}} to the Orange County (California) Sports Hall of Fame along with Pat McCormick, Ann Meyers and Cap Sheue. Four years earlier Youngblood was {{recognized}} as the 1983 Orange County Sportsman of the Year by the Orange County Youth Sports Foundation. Other notable honorees have been Jim Nantz, Peter Ueberroth, John McKay, <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh,</b> and Pete Carroll.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the front office and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh.</b> In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the last}} game of <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> first {{coaching}} stint with Stanford; following this game, he became {{head coach of the}} NFL's San Francisco 49ers, eventually leading them to three Super Bowl titles. Walsh returned to Stanford in 1992 and coached the Cardinal for three seasons and one bowl victory. Stanford's football program slid after Walsh's departure, and they would not return to a bowl for 8 years when they earned a berth in the 1986 Gator Bowl.|$|R

50|$|Nine {{months after}} their humiliating defeat {{at the hands}} of the 49ers in the NFC Championship Game, the Bears claimed their revenge by sacking Joe Montana a then-career high seven times. In return for 49ers coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> idea of sending in lineman Guy McIntyre in as fullback the season before, Mike Ditka sent in rookie William Perry, but as a runner, rather than a blocker. Shortly after the game and the flight back to Chicago, Ditka was arrested for DWI.|$|R
5|$|The 49ers' Million Dollar Backfield is {{regarded}} as one of the best backfields in NFL history, and is the only full-house backfield to have all four of its members enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame. By virtue of their memberships in the pro hall of fame, all four were automatically inducted as charter members of the San Francisco 49ers Hall of Fame in 2009. Longtime 49ers coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh</b> co-authored a book about the backfield in 2000 entitled The Million Dollar Backfield: The San Francisco 49ers in the 1950s. In 2014, a sculpture comprising the four players, crouched over as if in a huddle, was erected in Levi's Stadium.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} 19 head {{coaches in the}} history of the San Francisco 49ers {{professional}} football franchise. The San Francisco 49ers franchise was formed in 1946 as a charter member of the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) before joining the National Football League (NFL) in 1950 after the AAFC merger with the NFL. Buck Shaw became the first head coach of the 49ers in 1946, serving for nine seasons—four in the AAFC and five in the NFL. He coached a number of future College and Pro Football Hall of Famers, such as Frankie Albert, Joe Perry, Leo Nomellini, Y. A. Tittle, Bob St. Clair and Hugh McElhenny. In terms of tenure, <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh</b> has coached more games (152) and more complete seasons (10) than any other head coach in 49ers franchise history. He led the 49ers to playoff appearances in seven seasons, three of which led to the Super Bowl championship, in 1981, 1984 and 1988. Jerry Rice, Joe Montana, Charles Haley, Ronnie Lott, Johnny Davis, Roger Craig, Fred Dean and Steve Young are among the players Walsh has coached in his career.|$|E

5000|$|McIntyre {{was one of}} {{the first}} linemen in the modern age of the NFL to be used as a {{blocking}} back/fullback (in <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> [...] "Angus" [...] short-yardage formation); it was when this offense was used in the 1984 NFC Championship Game in the defeat of the Chicago Bears that motivated Bears coach Mike Ditka to use the same formation the following year, with William Perry, the [...] "Refrigerator" [...] as the blocking back, though Perry would also be used as a runner.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> West Coast Offense {{differs from}} {{traditional}} offense by emphasizing a short, horizontal passing attack to help stretch out the defense, thus opening up options for longer running plays and longer passes that can achieve greater gains. The West Coast Offense as implemented under Walsh features precisely run pass patterns by the receivers {{that make up}} about 65% to 80% of the offensive scheme. With the defense stretched out, the offense is then free to focus the remaining plays on longer throws of more than 14 yards and mid to long yard rushes.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{after the}} end of the 2005 season, Mike McCarthy, the 49ers' {{offensive}} coordinator of one year, left for the Green Bay Packers. On January 17, 2006, the 49ers hired Norv Turner as McCarthy's replacement. Whereas McCarthy based the majority of his offense on <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> West Coast Offense, Turner has been known to use a power running scheme and vertical passing game more often than the West Coast scheme. Turner came to the 49ers after two unsuccessful seasons as the head coach of the 49ers' crossbay rivals, the Oakland Raiders.|$|R
25|$|SJSU alumni Dick Vermeil and <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh</b> {{earned a}} {{combined}} four Super Bowl victories as NFL head coaches.|$|E
25|$|The coin toss {{ceremony}} posthumously honored Pro Football Hall of Fame {{head coach}} <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh,</b> {{who died on}} July 30, 2007. His former players Ronnie Lott, Jerry Rice and Steve Young joined Walsh's children, Craig and Elizabeth, at the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh</b> {{guided the}} 49ers to {{crushing}} playoff wins over the Minnesota Vikings, 34–9 and the Chicago Bears, 28–3. With the {{win over the}} Bears, the 49ers became the first road team to win an NFC Championship Game since the 1979 season.|$|E

5000|$|Green was {{a disciple}} of <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> West Coast offense and was touted by Walsh and other NFL pundits as a likely {{candidate}} {{to be the}} second African-American head coach in the NFL. On January 10, 1992, Green was named 5th {{head coach of the}} Minnesota Vikings, replacing the retiring Jerry Burns. The day he was introduced as the Vikings' head coach, he announced that there was a [...] "new sheriff in town". He would be only the second African American head coach after Art Shell in the modern NFL era, and only the third of all time after Fritz Pollard and Shell.|$|R
5000|$|Bernie Kosar {{used the}} term to {{describe}} the offense formalized by Sid Gillman with the AFL Chargers in the 1960s and later by Don Coryell's St. Louis Cardinals and Chargers in the 1970s and 1980s. Al Davis, an assistant under Gillman, also carried his version to the Oakland Raiders, where his successors John Rauch, John Madden, and Tom Flores continued to employ and expand upon its basic principles. This is the [...] "West Coast offense" [...] as Kosar originally {{used the term}}. However, it is now {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "Air Coryell" [...] timed system, and instead the term West Coast offense is usually used to describe <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> system.|$|R
25|$|Prior to the 1987 season, <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh</b> {{completed}} a trade for Steve Young, then a quarterback with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Young {{went on to}} appear in eight regular season games for the team and finished the year with a passer rating of 120.8.|$|E
25|$|As the 1980s wore on, teams {{began to}} {{gradually}} {{figure out the}} 46 defense. Offensive coordinators learned it was vulnerable to a short passing game, particularly the one devised by <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh</b> of the San Francisco 49ers (later {{referred to as the}} West Coast offense). The Bears also failed to draft proper replacements for aging starters.|$|E
25|$|This was {{the final}} NFL game coached by the 49ers' <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh,</b> as he retired from his job after the game. After {{spending}} the next three seasons as a broadcaster for NBC, he then coached Stanford from 1992 to 1994. Walsh {{then returned to the}} 49ers' front office, first serving as the team's Vice President and General Manager from 1999 to 2001, and as a consultant from 2002 to 2004.|$|E
50|$|The judging panel {{included}} band {{manager and}} television personality Louis Walsh, singer-songwriter Linda Martin and music executive <b>Bill</b> Hughes. <b>Walsh</b> {{was also a}} judge on the UK version. The programme was broadcast on a weekly basis; starting on November 15, 2001 and ending on February 17, 2002.|$|R
50|$|During the strike-shortened 1987 season, the 49ers led {{the league}} with a 13-2 record, {{including}} a 41-0 rout of the Bears in Week 14, because {{it turned out that}} the latter's feared defense was vulnerable to <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> short passing game. But San Francisco failed to win a playoff game for the third year in a row when they fell to the Minnesota Vikings 36-14. The loss to the Vikings was a stunning upset considering the 49ers that year were ranked #1 on both offense and defense, making them the odds-on favorite to go to the Super Bowl. Note that 1987 marked the first of six seasons when the 49ers had two Hall of Fame quarterbacks on the roster: from 1987 through 1992, Montana's backup (and frequent replacement) was Steve Young.|$|R
5000|$|After {{two seasons}} at Bowling Green, {{he took the}} job at Utah in 2003. [...] In his first year there, Meyer was named the Mountain West Conference's Coach of the Year with a 10-2 record, the best ever for a coach's first season at Utah. [...] He also earned honors as The Sporting News National Coach of the Year, the first Utes coach to do so. [...] Meyer's success can be {{attributed}} to his unique offensive system, which is an offshoot of <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> West Coast Offense, relying on short pass routes. [...] Meyer's base offense spreads three receivers and puts the quarterback in shotgun formation. [...] Then, he introduces motion in the backfield and turns it into an option attack, adding elements of the traditional run-oriented option offense.|$|R
25|$|Brown {{finished}} {{the game with}} five receptions for 137 yards and a touchdown, while Riggins rushed for 123 yards and two touchdowns. In addition, his 36-yard completion to Brown was the only completion he would ever throw during his 14-season career. This was the only postseason meeting between Hall of Fame coaches <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh</b> and Joe Gibbs, whose teams would combine for six Super Bowl appearances and five Super Bowl wins during the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|The Dallas Cowboys {{hosted the}} New York Giants {{in the first}} Sunday night game September 9 at 8:15p.m. US EDT. Monday Night Football on ESPN kicked off with a doubleheader on September 10 with the Cincinnati Bengals hosting the Baltimore Ravens at 7:00p.m. US EDT, and the San Francisco 49ers hosting the Arizona Cardinals at 10:15p.m. US EDT. The 49ers paid tribute to three-time Super Bowl winning head coach <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh,</b> who died July 30, in that game.|$|E
25|$|Floyd Gottfredson {{left his}} mark with stories such as Mickey Mouse Joins the Foreign Legion (1936) and The Gleam (1942). He also created the Phantom Blot, Eega Beeva, Morty and Ferdie, Captain Churchmouse, and Butch. Besides Gottfredson artists for the strip {{over the years}} {{included}} Roman Arambula, Rick Hoover, Manuel Gonzales, Carson Van Osten, Jim Engel, Bill Wright, Ted Thwailes and Daan Jippes; writers included Ted Osborne, Merrill De Maris, <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh,</b> Dick Shaw, Roy Williams, Del Connell, and Floyd Norman.|$|E
50|$|Beyond {{the basic}} {{principle}} of passing {{to set up}} the run, there are few rules that govern Walsh's West Coast Offense. Originally the offense used two split backs, giving it an uneven alignment in which five players aligned {{to one side of the}} ball and four players aligned on the other side (with the quarterback and center directly behind the ball). This imbalance forced defenses to abandon their own favored, conventional formations. Although Walsh-influenced teams now commonly use formations with more or fewer than two backs, the offense's unevenness is still reflected in its pass protection philosophy and continues to distinguish it from single back passing offenses. Throughout the years, coaches have added to, adjusted, modified, simplified, and enhanced <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> original adaptation of the Paul Brown offense. Formations and plays vary greatly, as does play calling.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Walsh</b> <b>bill</b> won almost {{unanimous}} {{support from}} the president, the cabinet, the Senate and even from Wagner himself. Wagner was unhappy {{with the number of}} provisions which had been watered down, but believed that passage of some legislation was preferable to inaction. He also resolved to draft much stronger legislation after the fall elections. Nevertheless, the <b>Walsh</b> <b>bill</b> faced an uncertain future in the Senate. Congress needed to adjourn and return home to campaign for the fall elections, and the bill promised a lengthy fight.|$|R
5000|$|Madden, once {{better known}} for Ace Hardware {{commercials}} than football despite winning Super Bowl XI with the Oakland Raiders, is now {{better known for}} Madden NFL than as coach or broadcaster. He receives an estimated $2 to 3 million each year for his endorsement but describes himself as [...] "never a good player" [...] of Madden, and prefers to watch others play. Although Madden says that [...] "a computer is a helluva lot smarter than me" [...] he has influenced the series' design from the first game, and since retiring from broadcasting and doing videogame voice commentary in 2009 his participation in each Maddens development has increased: He breaks down upcoming rules changes. He brings up concussions, helmet-to-helmet hits and gimmick quarterbacks. A digression on how the Dome Patrol-era Saints used to frustrate <b>Bill</b> <b>Walsh's</b> 49ers teams with short linebacker drops becomes a lecture on the obsolescence of the fullback, which then morphs into a short aside on player character.|$|R
