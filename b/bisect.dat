5|$|The Incas {{arranged}} their empire {{to demonstrate}} their cosmology. The capital, Cusco, was at {{the centre of the}} empire and connected to it by means of ceques, conceptually straight lines radiating out from the centre. These ceques connected the centre of the empire to the four suyus, which were regions defined by their direction from Cusco. The notion of a quartered cosmos is common across the Andes. Gary Urton, who has conducted fieldwork in the Andean villagers of Misminay, has connected this quartering with the appearance of the Milky Way in the night sky. In one season it will <b>bisect</b> the sky and in another <b>bisect</b> it in a perpendicular fashion.|$|E
5|$|M-222 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with M-40/M-89 {{in the town}} of Allegan at the corner of Cutler and Cedar streets. From there, the trunkline runs northward on Cedar Street for a block before turning eastward on Monroe Street. Then the highway proceeds through residential areas along Monroe and turns onto Grand Street to cross over the Kalamazoo River. M-222 intersects A-37 (Main Street) and runs next to Padgham Field before exiting town. From there, the highway continues on due eastward as 116th Avenue through rural areas and agricultural fields. Further east, the fields are taken over by forested area and residential subdivisions in places near Watson. The trunkline jogs to the south to <b>bisect</b> Wetheral Lake. M-222 ends north of US131 Motorsports Park near exit55 on US131 east of Martin.|$|E
50|$|The vertical-horizontal {{illusion}} is {{the tendency}} for observers to overestimate {{the length of a}} vertical line relative to a horizontal line of the same length. This involves a <b>bisecting</b> component that causes the <b>bisecting</b> line to appear longer than the line that is <b>bisected.</b> People often overestimate or underestimate the length of the <b>bisecting</b> line relative to the <b>bisected</b> line of the same length. This even happens if people are aware that the lines are of the same length.|$|R

5|$|The Green is a five-acre (two-hectare) plot {{located in}} the center of {{downtown}} Hanover, New Hampshire. It is crossed by seven gravel walking paths, the locations of which varied until about 1931, when the configuration was last altered. Three of them <b>bisect</b> the Green, running southwest to northeast, northwest to southeast, and east to west. The northernmost of its two east-west paths was added after Massachusetts Hall was constructed in 1907, and links the central entrance to that dormitory west of the Green to the northern entrance to Dartmouth Hall, east of it. Two paths run from the northwest and southwest corners respectively {{to the middle of the}} Green's eastern edge. A final path runs north-south along the eastern side. The Green also has paved sidewalks along its southern and western edges.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a new, massive {{development}} plan was announced for Haifa's waterfront. According to the plan, the western {{section of the}} city's port will be torn down, and all port activity will be moved to the east. The {{west side of the}} port will be transformed into a tourism and nightlife center and a point of embarkation and arrival for sea travel through the construction of public spaces, a beach promenade, and the renovation of commercial buildings. The train tracks that currently <b>bisect</b> the city and separate the city's beach from the rest of Haifa will also be buried. A park will be developed on the border of the Kishon River, the refineries' cooling towers will be turned into a visitors' center, and bridges will lead from the port {{to the rest of the}} city. Massive renovations are also currently underway in Haifa's lower town, in the Turkish market and Paris Square, which will become the city's business center. In addition, the ammonia depository tank in the Haifa bay industrial zone will be dismantled, and a new one built in an alternative location.|$|E
5|$|This brought {{together}} England's leading batsmen, Hutton and Compton. The latter, coming in upon {{the fall of}} Edrich, ran down the pitch before the ball was bowled and had to quickly play a defensive shot on the run. He clipped the next ball to the leg side for two runs before surviving a confident leg before wicket appeal from Johnson {{when he was on}} eight. Compton appeared ready to walk off, but umpire Chester declined the appeal, much to his surprise. England reached 50 in 65 minutes and with Lindwall missing, Bradman had difficulties in spreading the workload among his depleted bowling resources. The part-time leg spin of Barnes was brought on as the fifth bowling option to give the others some time to rest, and Miller resumed bowling late in the day, delivering slow off spin to conserve energy. Hutton and Compton exploited the depleted bowling attack and began to score freely, using their placement to <b>bisect</b> the gaps between the fielders. The pair did not give a chance apart from when Compton aimed an uppish square drive from Johnston that flew in the air wide of cover point.|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing a {{purified}} {{protein and}} <b>bisected</b> acceptor oligosaccharides, we demonstrate that N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase (GnT) -V transfers a N-acetylglucosamine residue via a β 1, 6 -linkage to the <b>bisected</b> oligosaccharides. We also kinetically characterized the substrate specificity of GnT-V {{with respect to}} the <b>bisected</b> oligosaccharide. Although the Km values for the <b>bisected</b> acceptors were comparable to that for a non-bisected acceptor, the Vmax values for the <b>bisected</b> acceptors were much lower than that for the non-bisected acceptor. These findings suggest that the acceptor specificity of GnT-V is determined by the catalytic process rather than by its binding to the substrate. It was also found that the presence of the 2 -N-acetyl group in the <b>bisecting</b> monosaccharide moiety plays a critical role in determining the catalytic efficiency of the enzyme...|$|R

5|$|There are two {{longitudinal}} {{coordinate systems}} in use for Vesta, with prime meridians separated by 150°. The IAU established a coordinate system in 1997 based on Hubble photos, {{with the prime}} meridian running {{through the center of}} Olbers Regio, a dark feature 200km across. When Dawn arrived at Vesta, mission scientists found that the location of the pole assumed by the IAU was off by 10°, so that the IAU coordinate system drifted across the surface of Vesta at 0.06° per year, and also that Olbers Regio was not discernible from up close, and so was not adequate to define the prime meridian with the precision they needed. They corrected the pole, but also established a new prime meridian 4° from the center of Claudia, a sharply defined crater 700 meters across, which they say results in a more logical set of mapping quadrangles. All NASA publications, including images and maps of Vesta, use the Claudian meridian, which is unacceptable to the IAU. The IAU Working Group on Cartographic Coordinates and Rotational Elements recommended a coordinate system, correcting the pole but rotating the Claudian longitude by 150° to coincide with Olbers Regio. It was accepted by the IAU, though it disrupts the maps prepared by the Dawn team, which had been positioned so they would not <b>bisect</b> any major surface features.|$|E

25|$|There are an infinitude {{of lines}} that <b>bisect</b> {{the area of}} a {{triangle}}. Three of them are the medians of the triangle (which connect the sides' midpoints with the opposite vertices), and these are concurrent at the triangle's centroid; indeed, {{they are the only}} area bisectors that go through the centroid. Any line through a triangle that splits both the triangle's area and its perimeter in half goes through the triangle's incenter (the center of its incircle). There are either one, two, or three of these for any given triangle.|$|E

25|$|The subgroups {{discussed}} {{so far are}} {{not only}} infinite, they are also continuous (Lie groups). Any subgroup containing at least one non-zero translation must be infinite, but subgroups of the orthogonal group can be finite. For example, the symmetries of a regular pentagon consist of rotations by integer multiples of 72° (360° / 5), along with reflections in the five mirrors which perpendicularly <b>bisect</b> the edges. This is a group, D5, with 10 elements. It has a subgroup, C5, of half the size, omitting the reflections. These two groups are members of two families, Dn and Cn, for any n > 1. Together, these families constitute the rosette groups.|$|E
