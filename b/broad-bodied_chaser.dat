Species include the <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula depressa), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), emperor (Anax imperator) and ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), {{as well as the}} first Cheshire {{sighting}} of the migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta).|$|E

5000|$|Libellula depressa [...] - <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> (Europe, West Asia). Sometimes {{included}} in the genus Ladona.|$|E
5000|$|The male is {{considered}} to be highly aggressive and will defend a given territory from incursions from other males of the species. The male is known to form preferences for prominent perches and will often return to the same perches around the margins of pools and ponds whilst it patrols for intruders. Males have a favourable view of the sky during perching. They look toward a section of the sky away from the sun, with less radiation but a higher UV and blue-violet saturation. Thus, the fovea of the eyes, which is sensitive to blue and UV radiation, is optimally suited to the detection of flying insects against the blue sky. [...] Both sexes are prolific fliers and mating takes place in the air, rather than on perches or amongst the vegetation. The female lays her eggs on floating vegetation. They tend to be easier to approach than <b>Broad-bodied</b> <b>Chasers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} species of breeding dragonfly and damselfly including the <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser,</b> common darter and banded demoiselle.|$|E
50|$|Nesting birds include mallard. Common frog, {{palmate newt}} and smooth newt breed in the pools. Dragonflies {{recorded}} include four-spotted chaser, <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser,</b> southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor, common darter {{and the small}} red damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The {{reserve is}} {{noted for its}} large and varied {{butterfly}} population.Insects to be found include butterflies (common blue, dingy skipper, grayling) and dragonflies (<b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser,</b> lesser emperor).Weevils were successfully introduced to the ponds to control the spread of azolla pond weed.|$|E
50|$|The {{presence}} of marsh violets makes the bog an ideal supportive habitat for the uncommon small pearl-bordered fritillary. Dragonflies are in abundance {{similar to the}} adjacent Woorgreens Lake and Marsh reserve. Records include <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> and the large red damselfly.|$|E
50|$|Libellula depressa, the <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> or broad-bodied darter, {{is one of}} {{the most}} common dragonflies in Europe and central Asia. It is very {{distinctive}} with a very broad flattened abdomen, four wing patches and, in the male, the abdomen becomes pruinose blue.|$|E
50|$|Dragonflies and damselflies are common, with 15 species recorded, {{two-thirds of}} which are known to breed here. Species include the <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula depressa), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), emperor (Anax imperator) and ruddy darter (Sympetrum sanguineum), {{as well as the}} first Cheshire {{sighting}} of the migrant hawker (Aeshna mixta).|$|E
50|$|The Meadow {{lies between}} the River Wandle and Mead Path, {{part of the}} Wandle Trail. Wetland plants and animals include small sweet-grass, eared willow and <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> dragonflies. Bullfinches, whitethroats and reed {{buntings}} breed in woodland areas. There are also bodies of water which {{have a variety of}} frogs, toads and newts.|$|E
50|$|Uncommon {{plant species}} include black bogrush, marsh fern, cranberry, bog asphodel, common cotton-grass, all three species of sundew and {{sphagnum}} moss. The common also supports some uncommon dragonfly {{species such as}} <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> and black darter. Many species of flowers grow in grassy clearings on the drier ground which attract butterflies such as green and purple hairstreaks and brown argus.|$|E
50|$|Some {{insects and}} {{dragonfly}} {{to be seen}} on the river include banded demoiselle, emerald damselfly, scarce emerald damselfly, large red damselfly, red-eyed damselfly, small red-eyed damselfly, azure damselfly, common blue damselfly, blue-tailed damselfly, migrant hawker, southern hawker, brown hawker, emperor dragonfly, four-spotted chaser, <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser,</b> black-tailed skimmer, keeled skimmer, common darter, ruddy darter, common hawker, Norfolk hawker, hairy dragonfly, red-veined darter, yellow-winged darter, black darter and the variable damselfly.|$|E
50|$|The Woorgreens {{reserve is}} {{considered}} to be the Forest of Dean's best dragonfly site, and over seventeen species have been recorded. Some of the species are scarce and breeding colonies in this area are important. They are supported by the network of other ponds and ditches in the area, such as Kensley pond. Breeding populations recorded include blue-tailed damselfly, large red damselfly, azure damselfly, southern hawker, ruddy sympetrum, <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> and the emperor dragonfly.|$|E
50|$|Another {{species of}} note, {{found in the}} wet flushed areas, is the nationally {{uncommon}} keeled skimmer dragonfly (Orthetrum coerulescens). This is a species of southern wet heathlands whose larvae develop in the wet mud of base-enriched flushes or bog pools. The valley is particularly rich in Odonata species: dragonflies recorded include the emperor (Anax imperator), golden-ringed (Cordulegaster boltonii), <b>broad-bodied</b> <b>chaser</b> (Libellula depressa), four-spotted chaser (Libellula quadrimaculata), southern hawker (Aeshna cyanea), common hawker (Aeshna juncea), black-tailed skimmer (Orthetrum cancellatum), common darter (Sympetrum striolatum), and black darter (Sympetrum danae); damselflies include the large red (Pyrrhosoma nymphula), azure (Coenagrion puella), emerald (Lestes sponsa), common blue (Enallagma cyathigerum), blue-tailed (Ischnura elegans), scarce blue-tailed (Ischnura pumilio), and beautiful demoiselle (Calopteryx virgo).|$|E
