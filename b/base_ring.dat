25|$|Development {{of the two}} new turret designs {{continued}} throughout 1943, {{but neither}} was ready by early 1944. The Rose turret shook severely during its early firing trials; this was eventually attributed to poor workmanship of the turret's <b>base</b> <b>ring.</b> In June 1944, the RAF placed an order for 600 Rose turrets after {{the problems with the}} design had been resolved. The turrets were built by hand at Rose Brothers' factory at Gainsborough, and were eventually produced at the rate of one per day; this rate was considered to be slow by the Air Staff. Production of the Rose turret ceased {{at the end of the}} war – by this time 400 had been completed. The FN82 took even longer to develop, and the first production model was completed in January 1945. None of Bomber Command's Lancasters had been fitted with an FN82 by the end of the war.|$|E

500|$|Like the Grey Cup, {{awarded to}} {{the winner of the}} Canadian Football League, the Stanley Cup is {{engraved}} with the names of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff. However, this was not always the case: one of Lord Stanley's original conditions was that each team could, at their own expense, add a ring to the Cup to commemorate their victory. Initially, there was only one <b>base</b> <b>ring,</b> which was attached {{to the bottom of the}} original bowl by the Montreal Hockey Club. Clubs engraved their team names, usually in the form [...] "TEAM NAME" [...] "YEAR WON", on that one ring until it was full in 1902. With no more room to engrave their names (and unwilling to pay for a second band), teams left their mark on the bowl itself. The 1907 Montreal Wanderers became the first club to record their name on the bowl's interior surface, and the first champion to record the name of every member of their team.|$|E
