40|$|The {{influence}} of feeding duration and tissue type on fatty acid (FA) deposition in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) tissues was investigated {{to establish the}} appropriate foundation for quantitative estimates of diet in wild fish. Fish were adapted to seawater and were fed one of four formulated diets based on krill or herring oil for 22 weeks. After 12 weeks of feeding, proportions of most FA in both <b>belly</b> <b>flap</b> and muscle tissues of salmon had changed substantially to resemble dietary FA proportions, showing little variation after an additional 10 weeks of feeding. However, tissues showed a differential response to diets, depending on the proportions of dietary FA. When present in large proportions in the diet, FA, including 18 : 2 n- 6 and monounsaturated FA, seemed to be selectively catabolized; when present in low proportions, selective retention in tissues occurred. Proportions of the polyunsaturated FA, 20 : 5 n- 3 and 22 : 6 n- 3, in tissues also varied with diet {{but not in a}} predictable manner related to dietary FA proportions. Further, the response to a change in the FA profile of diet was not equal for both tissues with <b>belly</b> <b>flap</b> tissue developing a FA signature that was more similar to the diet than muscle tissue. These results suggest that fish may represent a more complex study species than marine mammals for quantitative estimation of diet using FA. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} Belly-flap on {{aerodynamic}} performance of BWB civil aircraft are investigated in take-off and landing by computational fluid dynamics. And the overload of BWB with Belly-flap also is calculated {{in the same}} flight condition. Six parameters are discussed as design parameters of the <b>Belly</b> <b>flap.</b> It is shown that the proper combination of design parameters of Belly-flap can increase the maximum of lift and reduce the angle of attack and nose down moment to improve the flight safety in take-off and landing. When the aircraft with Belly-flap encounters the gust, the maximum overload {{is very close to}} 2. 5 which are requested by FAR. It is suggested the optimized design of Belly-flap should be done if the Belly-flap is applied in BWB civil aircraft...|$|E

40|$|Diets {{incorporating}} homogeneous binary {{mixtures of}} herring or krill oil were fed to Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) for 22 weeks, and <b>belly</b> <b>flap</b> and muscle tissues were then analyzed for fatty acid (FA) composition. Quantitative fatty acid signature analysis (QFASA) {{was able to}} estimate proportions of major dietary components within ~ 10 % of actual values, but {{the accuracy of the}} estimates depended on the FA set and calibration coefficients (CC) used in the modelling. FAs present at low levels had little influence on estimates, despite having only dietary sources; the FA set used in the modelling must incorporate the major FAs in tissues to ensure accurate estimates of diet. CC, which reflect modifications that consumers make to dietary FAs, were similar in the two tissues but varied with diet. When CC were applied to correct for fish metabolism, QFASA tended to overestimate the dietary component that had been fed to determine the CC. Diet estimates were most accurate when CC that had been developed from feeding the krill oil-based diet were applied. This first application of QFASA to fish therefore establishes a set of FAs and CC to begin to investigate diets of salmonids. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|Summary. There is an {{interest}} in bioprospecting organisms from the aquatic environment to find novel bioactive compounds with health promoting or other functional properties. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate extracts from  untreated and heat-treated salmon tissues for their radical scavenging activities and for their ability to inhibit activity of the proteases angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP- 4). In vitro assays were used to detect these activities and the corresponding candidate bioactive compounds were characterized by LC-MS/MS. Radical scavenging activity was detected in < 10 kDa extracts of gills, <b>belly</b> <b>flap</b> muscle and skin with EC 50 values of 39, 82 and 100 µg/mL, respectively. No ACE or DPP- 4 inhibiting activity could be detected. LC-MS/MS analysis of dominating compounds in active fractions from size exclusion chromatography showed that families of related compounds were found in several fractions from different tissues but most pronounced in gills. One family was defined according to content of a specific amino acid sequence (PW). Three families were defined by the m/z value of the smallest compound reported in each family (219, 434 and 403). The three latter families did not contain standard unmodified amino acids, indicating peptides with modified amino acids or other kinds of molecules. Industrial relevance. Bioprospecting in fish tissue traditionally regarded as waste can lead to detection of novel natural bioactive compounds including peptides, which could have nutritional, pharmaceutical or other functional value and be used in health and functional foods, thus increasing the value adding of secondary marine products. A number of  naturally occurring antimicrobial  peptides have been characterized from fish skin and gills, such as piscidins, but these and other fish tissues may contain numerous other compounds with bioactive properties. Such compounds could be extracted by the subsection of the fish industry that processes marine secondary products and further developed to commercial products. Thus, the identification of novel bioactive compounds could be utilized by the pharmaceutical and biotech industry to develop new products. Keywords.

40|$|The {{fisheries}} and fish processing industries have high labor costs. In part, {{this is due}} to visual inspection tasks, which are found in these industries, being so complex that humans are needed to do the inspection. One large class of inspection tasks is defect detection. This involves discerning whether a part or product is defective. Machine vision is a technology with the potential for solving many visually-based defect detection tasks, and has been successfully applied in automation systems in many industries (Hirano et. al. 2006). In this dissertation, machine vision is used successfully for defect detection in a number of specific applications in the {{fisheries and}} fish processing industries, and the particular challenges of applying machine vision, to these types of applications, are highlighted. Methods and approaches for meeting these challenges are discussed, with reference to their successful use the applications presented in this dissertation. A brief summary of each of the applications is presented in the following sections. The first application that was addressed, and the initial topic of this dissertation, was automatic sorting of cod viscera. Cod viscera are a valuable byproduct, containing different fractions. When the cod viscera is sorted into separate fractions, such as liver, roe and stomach, its value increases substantially. Sorting of cod viscera is done manually, and is a laborious process in the cod fisheries. This was the motivation for developing a method for automatic sorting of cod viscera, using machine vision and a robot. We developed and implemented hand-eye coordination algorithms for a 5 -DOF robot with a stereo camera platform. Assuming that a viscera fraction could be identified in images from both cameras, we thus had a method of directing the robot tool to the fraction. The remaining challenge was to identify the fraction in the images. Towards this end, we tested several approaches, culminating in a combination of color and texture features together with a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) classifier. We found the fraction detection, in visible light images, to be a very difficult problem to solve, and it was not solved adequately to be useful for automatic sorting of the cod viscera within the time-frame given. In light of this, the focus of this dissertation was changed – to encompass machine vision for defect detection in a number of specific fisheries and fish processing applications. The second application is a cod fisheries application – detecting nematodes and skin remnants, in cod fillets, using multi-spectral images in the visible and near-infrared. A combination of contrast-invariant Gabor texture features and linear discriminant analysis showed promising results for detecting both nematodes and skin remnants. The pixel-wise detection rate and false-alarm rate for nematode detection was on the order of 99 % and 1 % respectively, and for skin remnant detection approximately 90 % and 10 %. Combining this with multi-spectral features gave even better results. The data set was not large enough to draw any definitive conclusions in terms of detection rate and false-alarm rate in an industrial setting, but the results are promising enough to merit further investigation into the use of Gabor texture features for detecting nematodes and skin remnants in cod fillets. The third application is a fish processing application, and involves quality sorting of whole Atlantic salmon into the classes ‘superior/ordinary’ and ‘production’, in which case the ‘production’ are seen as being defective with respect to the ‘superior/ordinary’. Salmon characterized as ‘production’ may have several deviations from ‘superior/ordinary’ salmon, including a humpback or short tail. The approach taken, to solve the sorting problem described here, was to first segment the image in order to extract the salmon silhouette and orient it properly, independent of its original orientation. From this silhouette image, specific geometrical descriptive parameters were extracted. In the feature-space spanned by these descriptors, a linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was done to maximally discriminate between ‘production’ and ‘superior/ordinary’. This performance of this approach was analyzed using a leave-one-out (LOO) cross-validation procedure, and this showed that approximately 90 % of salmon could be correctly classified as ‘superior/ordinary’ or ‘production’. This machine vision system was further developed to discriminate between the more similar classes ‘superior’ and ‘ordinary’, and tested on a larger data set. The sorting accuracy for this system was also approximately 90 %. Thus, the system is well suited as part of automated system for quality sorting of whole Atlantic salmon. The fourth application is in the longline fisheries, and the task here is to detect defective longline hooks. In longline fishing, lines of up to 50 - 60 kilometers are used, each containing up to 40 000 hooks. Today, baiting, shooting (setting the line out in the sea) and hauling (pulling it back on board after soaking for some time in the sea) is almost completely automated. Between each hauling and the next shooting, the gear (line and hooks) is manually inspected, and any defective hooks are corrected or replaced. This manually-executed maintenance task is extremely labor-intensive. A machine vision system is presented, that can potentially automate this task. Combining knowledge from the fishermen, on what denotes a ‘defective’ hook, and machine vision knowledge, a set of features were automatically extracted from images of the hooks. Thousands of classifiers were automatically explored, and each classifier was plotted in the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) plane. From all of these, the classifiers on the ROC convex hull (ROCCH) were selected. On tests with more than 400 hooks, the classifiers on the ROOCH were found capable of detecting 97. 4 % of ‘defective’ hooks with zero false positives. Together with an automatic and mechanized hook replacement and repair system, this machine vision approach can automate the maintenance phase of longline fishing. The fifth application is in the pelagic fisheries and fish processing, and is the task of weight and quality grading of whole pelagic fish. In this work, the goal was to develop a single machine vision system {{that could be used to}} automatically perform both weight and quality grading – a labor-intensive task that is done manually today. This involved finding the optics, illumination and imaging modalities that could be used to weigh the fish automatically and detect most of the important defect types that could occur. The types of defects that occur in whole pelagic fish are many, including: split fish, superficial wounds, such as cuts scrapes, and deformations due to pressure and injuries. An imaging and illumination system, that combined 3 D range imaging, laser scatter imaging and diffuse gloss imaging, was developed and implemented in a prototype sorting station. Experiments showed that these imaging modalities could be used to detect all the defect types at a high processing speed. The prototype machine vision system was integrated with a conveyor belt and robot, and demonstrated the feasibility of using machine vision to automatically weigh whole pelagic and detect those fish that are defective. The main focus of this work was to develop the optical, imaging and illumination part of the machine vision system, and demonstrate proof-of-concept machine vision algorithms that could discriminate between defective and non-defective fish. The sixth application is detection of melanin spots in Atlantic salmon fillets. One of the manual operations done in salmon processing plants is to inspect the fillets and discard or process those that have melanin spots. Melanin spots are dark spots that reduce the quality grade of the fillet, and they are present in a substantial percentage of fillets. Melanin spots are caused by an inflammatory condition most often induced by vaccination. For the melanin spot detection application, a machine vision system using linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was developed that could detect 93 % of melanin spots. At this detection rate the number of false alarms was very high, but an investigation showed that these false alarms were entirely due to two main causes: 1. uneven illumination and 2. blood, viscera and fin remnants near the <b>belly</b> <b>flap.</b> By improving the illumination uniformity, and cleaning and trimming the fillets before inspection, we thus have a method for accurate detection of melanin spots. This system uses RGB images, and can thus be easily integrated in a fillet processing line where other quality parameters, such as trimming grade, pigmentation and shape, are measured using machine vision with RGB cameras. The seventh application is automatic trimming of salmon fillets, in which fin and tail remnants, belly fat, back fat and belly membranes are detected and removed. Trimming fillets is today done manually, after rough trimming in mechanical trimming machines. This application was developed into a prototype sorting station, with conveyor belt, robot and camera and illumination housing. As part of this complete prototype, a machine vision system had to be developed that could distinguish between the ‘defective’ and ‘non-defective’ parts of the fillet. The solution that was found involved using a 3 D camera with blue LED illumination. This gave use both the required 3 D data needed to perform the trimming, and the illumination needed to acquire images in which the ‘defective’ parts of the fillet were clearly discriminated. Once the images clearly distinguished between objects to be trimmed off (‘defective’ parts) and the remaining fillet, the subsequent image processing was much simplified. The work in this application illustrates the importance of looking at the entire machine vision system, and its context, as a whole. The prototype was fully functioning and demonstrated all the necessary parts needed in an automatic salmon fillet trimming station. The eighth application is automatic sorting of salmonid eggs. Salmon breeding companies can produce up to 100 million eggs per year, and these must be manually inspected before delivery to the hatcheries. This is a highly laborious and costly task, and is therefore very desirable to automate. This manual sorting is needed to remove unfertilized eggs, dead eggs and fertilized eggs with defects. A machine vision system, including optics, illumination and image processing, was developed that can sort more than 100 000 eggs per hour with a sorting error of less than 1 %. This machine vision system was demonstrated in a prototype sorting machine, and then implemented in an industrialized sorting machine. These sorting machines are now successfully in use at several salmon breeding facilities. The applications developed and described in this thesis demonstrate the effectiveness of machine vision for defect detection in fisheries and fish processing applications. The work on these applications shows that in order to be successful, all aspects of the application, and their context, must be taken into account. In each application there are specific constraints that make each application unique. Even so, there are some commonalities between many applications, in terms of the challenges involved. These commonalities have been highlighted in this dissertation, and appropriate methods and approaches have been found to meet them. Being aware of these challenges, and of the relevant methods and approaches to meeting them, increases the probability of successfully solving an application. As such, the work in this dissertation, and understanding of the lessons learnt in it, will benefit future applications of machine vision for defect detection in the fisheries and fish processing industries. Through continuing improvements in machine vision technology, and increasing domainspecific knowledge of how to apply this technology to fisheries and fish processing applications, almost all such applications can be partially or fully automated in the future. This dissertation shows that this vision is indeed a possibility, and hints at the directions needed to realize it.   PhD i informasjons- og kommunikasjonsteknologiPhD in Information and Communications Technolog...|$|E
