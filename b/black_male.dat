40|$|This chapter {{will address}} the {{excessive}} use of suspensions and other disciplinary actions against <b>Black</b> <b>males</b> who are disengaged from school. Academically disengaged students often come to school late, miss assignments, have difficulty understanding schoolwork, and may have attentional challenges or alternative learning styles. <b>Black</b> <b>males</b> can become disengaged from school {{for a variety of}} reasons, including being dissatisfied with school because of noninclusive curricula, racial biases, and poor relationships with teachers. In addition, some <b>Black</b> <b>males</b> are not socialized to the academic environment due to unclear and inconsistent messages about school from home and the community. Finally, some <b>Black</b> <b>males</b> have learning or attentional disabilities that are misunderstood or misdiagnosed. Research suggests that academically disengaged students account for the majority of all suspensions. This study will examine responses of students, parents and teachers who completed Monitoring the Future: A Continuing Study of American Youth. The chapter will clarify the relationship between suspensions and academic disengagement, and provide policy solutions for school leaders to develop strategies to reduce suspensions by providing a more inclusive and compassionate learning environment for <b>Black</b> <b>males...</b>|$|R

5|$|Stanton's {{position}} {{caused a}} significant rift {{between herself and}} many civil rights leaders, particularly Frederick Douglass, who believed that white women, already empowered by their connection to fathers, husbands, and brothers, at least vicariously had the vote. According to Douglass, their treatment as slaves entitled the now liberated African American men, who lacked women's indirect empowerment, to voting rights before women were granted the franchise. African American women, he believed, {{would have the same}} degree of empowerment as white women once African American men had the vote; hence, general female suffrage was, according to Douglass, of less concern than <b>black</b> <b>male</b> suffrage.|$|E
5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio Republicans {{to be an}} excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were more moderate than the Republican party's platform, although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to <b>black</b> <b>male</b> Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made the proposed amendment {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as the amendment failed to pass and Democrats gained a majority in the state legislature. Hayes thought at first that he, too, had lost, but the final tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|E
40|$|The 1970 census {{reported}} that there were slightly more than 1 million nonwhites among Michigan's 8, 875, 000 residents. Ninety-five percent of these nonwhites are black, and 75 percent live within the city limits of Detroit, compared with 10 percent of the State's white residents. Between 1959 - 61 and 1969 - 71, life expectancy at birth increased about 1 year for black and white females, essentially remained unchanged for white males, and decreased more than 3 years for <b>black</b> <b>males.</b> In 1969 - 71, life expectancy was 61 years for <b>black</b> <b>males,</b> 68 years for white males, 69 years for black females, and 75 years for white females. Much of this growing disparity noted resulted from a dramatic rise in deaths of <b>black</b> <b>males</b> in the 15 - 44 year age group. Two-thirds of this increase {{was caused by a}} major rise in mortality from two causes [...] accidents and homicides. While death rates for <b>black</b> <b>males</b> decreased for a number of other leading causes, these generally remained higher than similar figures for each of the other three race-sex groups. Given current rates, one of eight <b>black</b> <b>males</b> in Michigan ultimately will die from an accident or from homicide. This probability is 1 of 17 for white males, 1 of 30 for white females, and 1 of 26 for nonwhite females. Homicides reduced the life expectancy of <b>black</b> <b>males</b> by 2. 3 years, compared with 0. 2 year for white males, less than 0. 005 year for white females, and 0. 5 year for black females. More than three-quarters of all homicides of <b>black</b> <b>males</b> in Michigan in 1973 were caused by handguns...|$|R

A local black paper was surprised at the indictment and praised the decision, as did the New York Times. The high-profile comments published in Northern newspapers and by the NAACP were of concern to the prosecuting attorney, Gerald Chatham; he worried that his office {{would not be able to}} secure a guilty verdict, despite the compelling evidence. Having limited funds, Bryant and Milam initially had difficulty finding attorneys to represent them, but five attorneys at a Sumner law firm offered their services pro bono. Their supporters placed collection jars in stores and other public places in the Delta, eventually gathering $10,000 for the defense.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} years of the American Civil War and the Reconstruction Era that followed, Congress {{repeatedly}} debated the rights of the millions of black former slaves. By 1869, amendments had been passed to abolish slavery and provide citizenship and equal protection under the laws, but the election of Ulysses S. Grant to the presidency in 1868 convinced a majority of Republicans that protecting the franchise of <b>black</b> <b>male</b> voters was important for the party's future. On February 26, 1869, after rejecting more sweeping versions of a suffrage amendment, Congress proposed a compromise amendment banning franchise restrictions on the basis of race, color, or previous servitude. After surviving a difficult ratification fight, the amendment was certified as duly ratified and part of the Constitution on March 30, 1870.|$|E
5|$|As a Republican {{governor}} with a Democratic legislature, Hayes had {{a limited}} role in governing, especially since Ohio's governor had no veto power. Despite these constraints, Hayes oversaw {{the establishment of}} a school for deaf-mutes and a reform school for girls. He endorsed the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson and urged his conviction, which failed by one vote in the United States Senate. Nominated for a second term in 1869, Hayes campaigned again for equal rights for black Ohioans and sought to associate his Democratic opponent, George H. Pendleton with disunion and Confederate sympathies. Hayes was re-elected with an increased majority, and the Republicans took the legislature, ensuring Ohio's ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which guaranteed <b>black</b> (<b>male)</b> suffrage. With a Republican legislature, Hayes's second term was more enjoyable. Suffrage was expanded and a state Agricultural and Mechanical College (later to become The Ohio State University) established. He also proposed a reduction in state taxes and reform of the state prison system. Choosing not to seek re-election, Hayes looked forward to retiring from politics in 1872.|$|E
40|$|Given Rochester's unique {{human rights}} history that was {{influenced}} Fredrick Douglass and Susan B. Anthony, one might {{assume that the}} University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry has always {{been in the forefront}} of accepting and educating AfricanAmerican medical students. However, the numbers do not support this premise. Since the establishment of the medical school in 1925, 145 black medical students have graduated {{out of a total of}} 5, 865 medical school graduates ending in 2007. Of this group, 60 have been U.

To gain insight regarding the experiences of U. S. -born <b>black</b> <b>males</b> at the University of Rochester medical school a review of historical documents was conducted.

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} develop an {{understanding}} of how <b>Black</b> <b>males</b> received and perceived education within the further education (FE) sector in England. Using phenomenological inquiry and narratives provided by the <b>Black</b> <b>males</b> I consider how they engaged with education in the post compulsory sector and their views regarding the quality of their educational experience while studying at college. I explore the encounters they experienced in terms of accessing the taught curriculum, their experiences of the institutional cultures in FE and the relationships they were able to form with college staff members. I suggest that race is an underlying feature of many of these encounters and influenced both the nature and the outcome of the encounter. I examine how <b>Black</b> <b>males</b> chose to interact with structures and systems and the mechanisms they developed to help them navigate education, including accessing staff, peer and family support and how these different systems were significant to their achievement within colleges.

5|$|White-winged fairywrens live {{in complex}} social groups. Clans consist of 2–4 birds, {{typically}} one brown or partially blue male and a breeding female. Nest helpers are birds raised {{in previous years}} which remain with the family group after fledging and assist in raising young; they may be male that have retained their brown plumage, or female. Birds in a group roost side-by-side in dense cover and engage in mutual preening. Several subgroups live within one territory and make up a clan, which is presided over by one blue (or <b>black)</b> <b>male</b> who assumes breeding plumage. While the blue male is dominant {{to the rest of}} the brown and partially blue males within his clan, he nests with only one female and contributes to the raising of only her young.
