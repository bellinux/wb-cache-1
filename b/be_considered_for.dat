5|$|Antidepressants may be {{effective}} for treating chronic pain associated with symptoms of depression, {{but they have}} a risk of side effects. Although the antiseizure drugs gabapentin and carbamazepine are sometimes used for chronic low back pain and may relieve sciatic pain, there is insufficient evidence to support their use. Systemic oral steroids have not been shown to be useful in low back pain. Facet joint injections and steroid injections into the discs have not been found to {{be effective}} in those with persistent, non-radiating pain; however, they may <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> those with persistent sciatic pain. Epidural corticosteroid injections provide a slight and questionable short-term improvement in those with sciatica but are of no long term benefit. There are also concerns of potential side effects.|$|E

Generally, reviewers felt that the novel succeeded in portraying its Greek immigrant drama and were also impressed with Eugenides' depiction of his hometown of Detroit—praising him for his social commentary. Reviewers from the medical, gay, and intersex communities mostly praised Middlesex, though some intersex commentators have been more critical. In 2007, the book was featured in Oprah's Book Club.|$|E
5|$|Following an announcement, in August 2015, that {{tennis player}} Sania Mirza {{was to be}} awarded, a Public-Interest Litigation was filed in the Karnataka High Court. The petitioner, Paralympic athlete H. N. Girisha, {{mentioned}} that his performance was ignored by the committee. Girisha {{claimed to be a}} top contender for the award with 90 points, owing to his silver medal winning act at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in the Men's High Jump F42 event. The petition mentioned that the points for Mirza's Grand Slam titles from 2011 until 2015 should not be counted as the events were {{not a part of the}} list of sports events to <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> the performance evaluation. The court withheld the conferment and sought replies from the Ministry about the selection process.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Baseball Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis in November 1944, John O. Gottlieb, a friend of Chandler's in the War Department, {{suggested}} Chandler as a successor. Baseball owners who had been afraid that their players would be made eligible for the draft during the war had decided that their new commissioner needed to have the skills and influence to represent baseball's interests in Washington, D. C. As a senator, Chandler had advocated on behalf of baseball during the war, endearing him to the owners. Furthermore, the commissioner's $50,000 annual salary—about five times that of a US senator at the time—proved a significant enticement, and Chandler agreed to <b>be</b> <b>considered</b> <b>for</b> the job.|$|E
