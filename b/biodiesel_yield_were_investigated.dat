40|$|A {{one-step}} {{process was}} applied to directly converting wet oil-bearing microalgae biomass of Chlorella pyrenoidosa containing about 90 % of water into biodiesel. In order to investigate the effects of water content on biodiesel production, distilled water was added to dried microalgae biomass to form wet biomass used to produce biodiesel. The results showed that at lower temperature of 90 °C, water had {{a negative effect on}} biodiesel production. The <b>biodiesel</b> <b>yield</b> decreased from 91. 4 % to 10. 3 % as water content increased from 0 % to 90 %. Higher temperature could compensate the negative effect. When temperature reached 150 °C, there was no negative effect, and <b>biodiesel</b> <b>yield</b> <b>was</b> over 100 %. Based on the above research, wet microalgae biomass was directly applied to biodiesel production, and the optimal conditions <b>were</b> <b>investigated.</b> Under the optimal conditions of 100 [*]mg dry weight equivalent wet microalgae biomass, 4 [*]mL methanol, 8 [*]mL n-hexane, 0. 5 [*]M H 2 SO 4, 120 °C, and 180 [*]min reaction time, the <b>biodiesel</b> <b>yield</b> reached as high as 92. 5 % and the FAME content was 93. 2 %. The results suggested that biodiesel could be effectively produced directly from wet microalgae biomass and this effort may offer the benefits of energy requirements for biodiesel production...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of biodiesel from off-grade palm oil needs {{the help of}} CaO/fly ash during the transesterification step. CaO with high basicity and acts as a good catalyst. The use of fly ash as the support of CaO catalyst has several benefits because it is safe for the environment, it adds economical value, and Ca inside the fly ash itself can be utilized. The {{synthesis of}} biodiesel in this research aims to observe the effect of reaction temperature, molar ratio of methanol : oil, {{and the effect of}} CaO/fly ash concentration towards <b>biodiesel</b> <b>yield.</b> The synthesis of biodiesel is performed through esterification reaction {{to reduce the amount of}} free fatty acid content in oil, and is continued by transesterification reaction to produce biodiesel. Data processing in this research is conducted using Response Surface Methodology (RSM) with the help of Design Expert 7. 0 software, while experimental design is determined using Central Composite Design (CCD) which consists of 3 variables.

40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} {{renewable}} energy in Indonesia {{that have to be}} development. Biodiesel formed as liquid fuel and has same property with petrodiesel. Biodiesel can be synthesized from off-grade palm oil using Na 2 O/fly ash as catalyst in transesterification process. Employing fly ash as support in Na 2 O has a good impact due to provide wide surface of catalyst. In this study aims to see the influence of reaction temperature, molar ratio of methanol and oil and concentration of Na 2 O/fly ash towards <b>biodiesel</b> <b>yield.</b> The process <b>was</b> conducted through reaction of esterification and followed by transesterification reaction. Processing of the data in this study was conducted by response surface methodology (RSM) using Design Expert 7. 0 program which is experimental design determined by central composite design (CCD) which consists of three variables. The highest result of <b>biodiesel</b> <b>yield</b> <b>was</b> 81, 2 % at 60 oC reaction temperature, molar ratio of methanol : oil 8 : 1 and catalyst concentration of Na 2 O/fly ash 4 %-wt. Biodiesel characteristics such as density, kinematic viscosity, acid value and flash point has been appropriate by Indonesian biodiesel standard. The most significant condition of process affecting the <b>yield</b> of <b>biodiesel</b> <b>was</b> catalyst concentration...|$|R
