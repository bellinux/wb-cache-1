40|$|To date, {{research}} into the implementation of autonomous self-replicating systems has focused either on highly abstract logical models, or on physical systems that are deliberately engineered in some way {{so as to make}} the problem more tractable [1]. There are also several system-level proposals for physical self-replicating systems. A simulation environment is presented at a level of abstraction that supports motion, connection and disconnection of parts, and which enforces the conservation of matter. This level of abstraction lies somewhere between cellular automaton models and real physical systems. The simulation environment is a 3 D kinematic automaton in which cubic parts can be placed into a discrete space and connected together to make machines. The environment supports six part types: A wire part receives a <b>boolean</b> <b>input</b> value at its base and propagates this value to all five of its outputs after one time unit. A nor-gate part receives <b>boolean</b> <b>input</b> values from all five of its inputs, and propagates the logical NOR of these values to its output after one time unit. A slide part receives a <b>boolean</b> <b>input</b> value from its input. If this value is true, then one time unit later it will move any part directly opposite its input. A rotate part receives a <b>boolean</b> <b>input</b> value from its input. If this value is true then one time unit later it will rotate any part directly opposite its input. A connect part receives a <b>boolean</b> <b>input</b> value from its input. If this value is true then one time unit later it will connect together the part lying opposite its input to a neighbouring part. A disconnect part receives a <b>boolean</b> <b>input</b> value from its input. If this value is true then one time unit later it will disconnect the part lying opposite its input from a neighbouring part. The simulation environment has previously been described in [2]. A self-replicating programmable constructing machine (SRPC) with an architecture similar to that in [3] has been implemented in this environment. The machine can take a disorganised collection of parts as its input and construct machines from these parts according to a sequence of instructions. As a special case, it can be programmed to construct a replica of itself. The machine is made from 59, 504 parts, of which 49, 152 make up the machine's memory. By demonstrating that an SRPC can be implemented in this environment, it is shown that some of the results already obtained about SRPCs in cellular automaton environments can be extended into the domain of kinematic systems, and also that consideration of the kinematical concepts of motion and connectivity along with the conservation of matter does not introduce any barrier to the existence of such machines.

40|$|Abstract. The paper explores a {{utilization}} of Boolean factorization {{as a method}} for data preprocessing in classification of Boolean data. In previous papers, we demonstrated that data preprocessing consisting in replacing the original Boolean attributes by factors, i. e. new Boolean attributes that are obtained from the original ones by Boolean factorization, improves the quality of classification. The aim {{of this paper is}} to explore the question of how the various Boolean factorization methods that were proposed in the literature impact the quality of classification. In particular, we compare three factorization methods, present experimental results, and outline issues for future research. 1 Problem Setting In classification of Boolean data, the objects to classify are described by Boolean (binary, yes-no) attributes.

40|$|Current logic {{synthesis}} {{techniques are}} ineffective for arithmetic circuits. They perform poorly for XOR-dominated circuits, {{and those with}} a high fan-in dependency between inputs and outputs. Multipliers are particularly challenging {{because of the high}} fanout that results from the partial product generator. Many optimizers, therefore employ libraries of hand-optimized arithmetic components, but cannot optimize across component boundaries. To remedy this situation, we introduce a new logic synthesis algorithm that analyzes the cofactors of the <b>Boolean</b> <b>input</b> expressions. To the best of our knowledge, this approach is the first general logic synthesis algorithm that can handle complex arithmetic circuits such as multipliers of non-trivial size without having any prior knowledge about the functionality of the circuit; it can also optimize larger composite arithmetic circuits that contain a variety of components. The approach reduces the delay of the composite circuits by 15 – 40 % compared to the use of locally optimized library components without cross-component optimization...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the problem of constructing a mapping from an arbitrary input space into a binary output space f 0; 1 g d, based on a given data set X partitioned into classes. The aim is to reduce the total amount of information, while keeping the most relevant of it for the partitioning. An additional constraint to our problem is that the mapping must have a simple interpretation. Thus, each of the d discriminants is related to one original attribute (e. g. linear combinations of original attributes are not admitted). Beyond data compression, the targeted application is a preprocessing for classication techniques that require <b>Boolean</b> <b>input</b> data. While other existing techniques for this problem are constructive (increasing d iteratively, such as decision trees), the method proposed here proceeds by starting with a very large dimension d, and by reducing it iteratively.

40|$|AbstractLinear {{threshold}} functions (for {{real and}} <b>Boolean</b> <b>inputs)</b> have received much attention, {{for they are}} the component parts of many artificial neural networks. Linear threshold functions are exactly those functions such that {{the positive and negative}} examples are separated by a hyperplane. One extension of this notion is to allow separators to be surfaces whose equations are polynomials of at most a given degree (linear separation being the degree- 1 case). We investigate the representational and expressive power of polynomial separators. Restricting to the Boolean domain, by using an upper bound on the number of functions defined on 0, 1 n by polynomial separators having at most a given degree, we show, as conjectured by Wang and Williams (1991), that for almost every Boolean function, one needs a polynomial surface of degree at least ⌊n 2 ⌋ in order to separate the negative examples from the positive examples. Further, we show that, for odd n, at most half of all Boolean functions are realizable by a separating surface of degree ⌊n 2 ⌋. We then compute the Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of the class of functions realized by polynomial separating surfaces of at most a given degree, both for the case of <b>Boolean</b> <b>inputs</b> and real inputs. In the case of linear separators, the VC dimensions coincide for these two cases, but for surfaces of higher degree, there is a strict divergence. We then use these results on the VC dimension to quantify the sample size required for valid generalization in Valiant's probably approximately correct framework (Valiant, 1984; Blumer et al., 1989) ...|$|R
