5000|$|The HK416 is {{equipped}} with a proprietary accessory rail forearm with MIL-STD-1913 rails on all four sides. This lets most current accessories for M4/M16-type weapons fit the HK416. The HK416 rail forearm can be installed and removed without tools by using the <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> as the screwdriver. The rail forearm is [...] "free-floating" [...] and does not contact the barrel, improving accuracy.|$|E
2500|$|Behind {{the bolt}} carrier is a plastic or metal buffer, which rests {{in line with}} a return spring. The buffer spring begins to push the bolt carrier and bolt back toward the chamber once it is {{compressed}} sufficiently. A groove machined into the upper receiver guides the bolt cam pin and prevents it and the bolt from rotating into a closed position. The <b>bolt's</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> push a fresh round from the magazine as the bolt moves forward. The round is guided by feed ramps into the chamber. As the <b>bolt's</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> move past the barrel extension, the cam pin twists into a pocket milled into the upper receiver. This twisting action follows the groove cut into the carrier and forces the bolt to twist and [...] "lock" [...] into the barrel extension.|$|R
2500|$|L59A1 Drill Rifles were {{rendered}} {{incapable of}} being fired, and of being restored to a fireable form, by extensive modifications {{that included the}} welding of the barrel to the receiver, modifications to the receiver that removed the supporting structures for the <b>bolt's</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> and blocking the installation of an unaltered bolt, {{the removal of the}} striker's tip, the blocking of the striker's hole in the bolt head and the removal of most of the <b>bolt</b> body's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs.</b> Most <b>bolts</b> were copper plated for identification. A plug was welded in place forward of the chamber, and a window was cut {{in the side of the}} barrel. The stock and fore end was marked with broad white painted bands and the letters [...] "DP" [...] for easy identification.|$|R
50|$|Mannlicher {{designed}} two semi-automatic rifles both called Model 93, {{one based}} on his turn-bolt rifle and the other based on his straight-pull rifle. The rifles had a recoil spring housing behind the bolt and the <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> were angled, so the bolt started turning on firing, essentially a hesitation lock or delayed blowback much like the later Thompson Autorifle utilising the Blish lock. In this system there was no recoiling barrel nor gas piston as with other rifle-caliber autoloading designs, so the mechanism was simple, but ejection of fired cartridge casings was so fierce as to be hazardous to bystanders.|$|R
5000|$|The short-recoil {{operated}} Auto Mag pistol {{featured a}} rotary <b>bolt</b> with <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> {{located at the}} front similar to the M-16/AR-15 rifle. The Auto Mag is a heavy pistol designed to give handgun owners [...]44 Magnum power in a semi-automatic pistol. The [...]44 Auto Mag was designed to shoot [...]429 inch, 240 grain bullets {{at about the same}} velocity as the [...]44 Magnum revolver.|$|R
25|$|The Galil {{series of}} rifles are {{selective}} fire weapons {{operated by a}} Kalashnikov-pattern gas-driven piston system with no regulator. The weapon is locked with a rotary <b>bolt</b> with two <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> that <b>lock</b> into recesses milled into the receiver.|$|R
50|$|CMMG {{introduced}} the Mk 45 Guard rifle incorporating a radial-delay in 2017. This system uses {{the rotation of}} the bolt head to accelerate the bolt carrier of an AR-15 pattern rifle. The <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> are adapted to incorporate angles that rotate the bolt as it travels rearward under conventional blowback power. As the bolt rotates, it must accelerate the bolt carrier to the rear through an adapted cam-pin slot. This acceleration amplifies the effective mass of the bolt carrier, slowing the speed of the bolt head. This delay allows pressure to drop prior to extraction without the penalty of a heavier bolt carrier assembly. The system is similar to roller and lever-delayed blowback in that it uses the mass of the bolt carrier moving at a faster rate than the bolt head to delay the action from opening.|$|R
50|$|The 1922M2 variant was {{introduced}} in 1933. This version featured a simplified bolt and a shallower pistol grip on the stock. All versions of the M1922 used {{what would be the}} safety lug on the 1903 <b>bolt</b> as the <b>locking</b> <b>lug.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Model 1200 was {{the first}} shotgun to utilize a rotary <b>bolt</b> with four <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> secured within the barrel extension. The 1200 was Winchester's first shotgun to {{incorporate}} the company's patented Winchoke system, a quick change tube to allow the easy replacement of chokes.|$|R
50|$|The bolt is {{an easily}} {{manufactured}} assembly, {{consisting of a}} tube with a rotating forward baffle and the <b>bolt</b> head (with <b>locking</b> <b>lugs)</b> at one end, a removable handle attached via a threaded bolt and a rotating rear baffle {{at the rear of}} the assembly.A striker assembly is held within.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>bolt</b> action's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> are {{normally}} {{at the front}} of the breech (some designs have additional [...] "safety lugs" [...] at the rear), and this increases potential accuracy relative to a design which locks the breech at the rear, such as a lever action. Also, a bolt action's only moving parts when firing are the pin and spring. Since it has fewer moving parts and a short lock time, it has less of a chance of being thrown off target and/or malfunctioning.|$|R
5000|$|The 760 {{featured}} a detachable box magazine, dual action bars, and a removable aluminum trigger group. The <b>bolt</b> featured 14 <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> {{laid out in}} an interrupted-thread pattern. These <b>lugs</b> <b>locked</b> into corresponding <b>lugs</b> in a barrel extension {{by means of a}} cam-rotated bolt. [...] This bolt arrangement was problematic and the interrupted thread lugs were replaced with more conventional lugs on the Model 7600 that replaced it.|$|R
50|$|The pistol is {{manually}} operated using a rotary <b>bolt,</b> <b>locking</b> with two <b>lugs.</b> Loading is performed with a pull/push action using the round knurled knob {{to the rear}} of the weapon. The trigger is single stage with a simple safety at the back of the magazine housing. The detachable single stack magazine contains six or eight rounds (depending on calibre) and serves as a pistol grip with the bottom part enclosed into the plastic cover.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bolt</b> having four <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> {{derived from}} the Schultz & Larsen Model 54J of 1953 and 62M of 1961. The lugs were moved {{to the front of}} the bolt (as opposed to the Schultz & Larsen design) but were of the same ‘generous’ size. The {{position}} of the lugs, at 45 degrees when closed, was suggested to be a compromise between the compensation characteristics of the Mauser and Lee-Enfield types of action with the former locking vertically and the latter horizontally.|$|R
50|$|The HK416 {{was one of}} {{the weapons}} {{displayed}} to U.S. Army officials during an invitation-only Industry Day on November 13, 2008. The goal of the Industry Day was to review current carbine technology prior to writing formal requirements for a future replacement for the M4 carbine. The HK416 was then an entry in the Individual Carbine competition to replace the M4. The weapon submitted was known as the HK416A5. It features a stock {{similar to that of the}} G28 designated marksman rifle, except slimmer and non-adjustable. The rifle features an improved tool-less adjustable gas regulator for suppressor use, which can accommodate barrel lengths down to 267 mm without modifications. It also features a redesigned lower receiver with ambidextrous fire controls, optimized magazine and ammunition compatibility, a repair kit housed inside the pistol grip, and a Flat Dark Earth color-scheme. The stock has a fixed buttplate and no longer has a storage space, as well as the sling loops removed from it. The V2 HK Battle grip is incorporated, which has the V2 grip profile with the storage compartment of the V1 grip for tools. The handguard uses a new hexagonal-shaped cross bolt that cannot be removed by the <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lugs,</b> but instead by the takedown tool housed inside the grip. The Individual Carbine competition was cancelled before a winning weapon was chosen. The HK416A5 offers several additional features compared to the preceding HK416 models and has become the standard military and law enforcement model line.|$|R
5000|$|The [...]300 Winchester Magnum round {{was chosen}} as the primary caliber because of its long range {{accuracy}} and its consistency at all ranges. The entire rifle is designed around the barrel. The WA 2000 fires from a closed bolt and uses a <b>bolt</b> with seven <b>locking</b> <b>lugs.</b> It has a two-stage trigger with a trigger pull of 1.2 to 1.4 kg (2.65 to 3.1 lb). The rifle uses single stack box magazines with a 6-round capacity, which weigh 0.4 kg (0.88 lb) when loaded.|$|R
50|$|The Model 52 was a non-rotating, rear-locked bolt-action design. The Model D-derived {{receiver}} was cylindrical, {{bored and}} machined from a forged billet, and of substantial thickness. The <b>bolt's</b> dual <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> {{were part of}} the rotating bolt-handle collar, which provided a camming action to seal the breech on closing and extract the spent case on opening. The bolt itself was undercut for the forward third of its length and rode on polished flats; a projecting lug at the front edge caught the top cartridge in the magazine. The bolt face was rebated so as to surround the case rim, and was chamfered to fit the recessed receiver ring. Dual-opposed sprung claw extractors were inlet into the sides of the bolt, providing controlled cartridge feed. A fixed blade-type ejector was located {{at the rear of the}} loading platform.|$|R
5000|$|The Berthier design {{began as}} the [...] "Mousquetons Berthier" [...] - {{a series of}} bolt action cavalry and {{artillery}} carbines with distinctly different actions from the Mle 1886/M93 8mm Lebel rifle. For instance, the Berthier carbine's <b>bolt</b> <b>lugs</b> <b>lock</b> vertically into the receiver instead of horizontally as in the Lebel rifle. Berthier carbines were first issued in 1890 and 1892, and had been designed by Emile Berthier, an engineer at the French Algerian Railways,to be used with standard 8mm Lebel ammunition.|$|R
50|$|The breech {{is locked}} by a {{rotating}} <b>bolt,</b> with two <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> engaging <b>locking</b> recesses in the receiver. The gas piston is hinged to the bolt carrier assembly, and its vertical travel {{makes it possible}} to bend the group making machine gun assembly and disassembly for maintenance easier. The protruding rear part of the bolt carrier assembly features spiral shaped cuts, which provide a controlled rotation of the bolt. The mainspring is accommodated in the bolt carrier assembly slide channel. A cartridge extractor with a latch is mounted in the rear part of the bolt carrier assembly. The cocking lever, mounted on the right, is not integral with the bolt carrier and does not reciprocate as the gun fires.The machine gun fires from the rear sear.|$|R
50|$|The RK 95 TP is a select-fire, gas-operated firearm {{using the}} Kalashnikov-pattern {{operating}} {{system with a}} long stroke gas piston rod coupled to the bolt carrier as in the AK rifle. The rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> into battery via two <b>locking</b> <b>lugs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The rifle {{maintains}} the British cock-on-closing feature, {{in which the}} bolt's mainspring is loaded and the rifle cocked {{as part of the}} return stroke of the bolt, which aided rapid fire, especially as the action heated up. Most bolt action designs after the Mauser 98 cocked as part of the opening stroke. The rifle has a characteristic [...] "belly" [...] due to a deeper magazine, allowing the rifle to hold six rounds of the US [...]30-06 cartridge in the magazine, and one in the chamber. The M1917 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. In a manufacturing change from the Mauser 98 and the derivative Springfield, the bolt is not equipped with a third 'safety' lug. Instead, as on the earlier Model 1895 (Chilean) Mauser, the bolt handle recesses into a notch in the receiver, which serves as an emergency <b>locking</b> <b>lug</b> in the event of failure of the frontal <b>locking</b> <b>lugs.</b> This change saved machine time needed on the rifle bolt, cutting costs and improving production rates, and this alteration has since been adopted by many commercial bolt-action rifle designs for the same reasons.The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee-Enfield, P13 and P14, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently.The M1917 Enfield <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> had a 4 degree helical angle with matching angles on the receiver lug seats (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The design probably used helical <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The angled lugs had no tendency to unwind with chamber pressure since the [...] "angle of repose" [...] of smooth, lubricated steel surfaces is approximately 8 degrees. One advantage was that when the bolt handle was turned up was that the lugs cleared each other immediately so full effort was applied to the extraction cam. The trigger had a mechanical interlock to prevent firing unless the <b>bolt</b> was fully <b>locked.</b> The location of the safety on the right rear of the receiver has also been copied by most sporting bolt-action rifles since, as it falls easily under the firer's thumb. The trigger pull is ≥ 3 lb-f N. One notable design flaw was the leaf spring that powered the ejector, which could break off and render the ejector inoperable. A combat-expedient repair method was to slip a bit of rubber under the bolt stop spring. A redesigned ejector, incorporating a small coil spring in place of the fragile leaf spring, was developed and can be fitted to the M1917 to remedy this issue.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the weapon showed the {{emphasis}} on accurate, rapid fire emphasised by British Army training during this period. The adjustable flip-up aperture rearsight with a 300-yard battle setting when folded down was an excellent design, allowing rapid and accurate sight acquisition, and was advanced for the period. The Mauser-type bolt had a low-profile bolt handle with an integral safety lug built into its base that locked in the receiver. The unusual 'dog-leg' shaped bolt handle is low profile and places the bolt knob just rearwards of the trigger close to the firer's hand, again facilitating rapid cycling and fire. Like the Lee-Enfield, the safety falls under the firer's thumb and can be operated silently. The action was configured to be easily operable, even when heated by sustained rapid fire, with slick operation, cock-on-closing feature and positive camming action when opening or closing the bolt. The Pattern 1913 Enfield <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> had a 4 degree helical angle with matching angles on the receiver lug seats (the technical term is interrupted threading). This means that final head space is not achieved until the bolt handle is turned down all the way. The Lee-Enfield rifle also featured helical locking surfaces. The British probably used helical <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> to allow for chambering imperfect or dirty ammunition and that the closing cam action is distributed over the entire mating faces of both bolt and receiver lugs. This is one reason the bolt closure feels smooth. The angled lugs had no tendency to unwind with chamber pressure since the [...] "angle of repose" [...] of smooth, lubricated steel surfaces is approximately 8 degrees. One advantage was that when the bolt handle was turned up was that the lugs cleared each other immediately so full effort {{was applied to the}} extraction cam. The trigger had a mechanical interlock to prevent firing unless the <b>bolt</b> was fully <b>locked.</b> The action was large and strong compared to other military service rifle bolt actions, since it had to be capable of handling the dimensionally large [...]276 Enfield cartridge variants, and the barrel was given a heavy profile. The Pattern 1913 Enfield like the Mauser Gewehr 98 had no magazine cut-off mechanism, which when engaged permits the feeding and extraction of single cartridges only while keeping the cartridges in the magazine in reserve. It was a long and comparatively heavy rifle - the Lee-Enfield Mk III weighed 8 lb empty - and the pronounced sight protector 'ears', the 'pot-belly' magazine and 'dog-leg' bolt handle gave it an ungainly air.|$|R
25|$|The rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> {{mechanism}} {{consists of}} two steel <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> that engage <b>locking</b> recesses in the breech, and is identical to that used in the SG 540. A spring-loaded extractor is incorporated into the bolt while a fixed protrusion {{on one of the}} receiver's internal guide rails ejects the spent cartridge casings.|$|R
50|$|The AT is {{chambered}} in 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester. It is {{a manual}} operated, bolt action sniper rifle. It features a rotary <b>bolt</b> with six <b>locking</b> <b>lugs,</b> arranged into three pairs at the bolt head, a polymer stock with aluminum alloy chassis, and a solid, flat-bottomed receiver made of steel, the AI (Accuracy International) muzzle brake (optional), a detachable suppressor, a 20-, 24- inch plain or threaded barrel, and a 26 inch threaded barrel only, a 10 round detachable magazine, an integral Picatinny (Mil-Std 1913) rail above the receiver for mounting various optics/scopes {{and an additional}} accessory rails can be easily bolted to the forend of the rifle for mounting various accessories, a standard stock that is made from a polymer and features fully adjustable comb and buttpad, side-folding stock that folds to the left is available, a two stage trigger that is adjustable for trigger weight between 1.5 to 2 kg.|$|R
50|$|The Mondragón Modelo 1908 was a gas-operated rifle with a {{rotating}} bolt, and a cylinder and piston arrangement. This design is now common, but was unusual at the time. The <b>bolt</b> was <b>locked</b> by <b>lugs</b> in helical grooves in the receiver. There was a switch, {{located on the}} charging handle, which would disengage the bolt from the gas system, changing the firearm into a straight-pull, bolt action, rifle. The rifle had a non-detachable box magazine and was filled by two, five-round stripper clips. The Mondragón Modelo 1908 rifles were fitted with a bipod. In addition to the knife bayonet introduced with the previous rifles, Mondragón designed a spade bayonet for use with the Modelo 1908, for which he filed a patent application (No. 631,283) on June 6, 1911.|$|R
50|$|The Pindad G2 is a recoil-operated {{semi-automatic}} handgun which harnesses the recoil of the fired bullet to {{push the}} slide rearwards, ejecting the spent cartridge of the previous bullet. The slide is then pushed forward using springs, this action extracts a round from the magazine and pushes it in the chamber. Then, the <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> by means of <b>locking</b> <b>lugs.</b> Since the firearm is single-action only, the hammer must be cocked manually in order to fire another round.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Fusil Ametrellador Systema Mendoza" [...] Model 1934 is an air-cooled, magazine-fed, gas-operated {{light machine}} gun {{weighing}} approximately 18.5 lb. The design features a quick-detachable barrel with 39 radial cooling fins, a flash hider and a bipod. The top-mounted, 20-or 30-round box magazine is offset to the right, allowing the sights to be centered. The rotating <b>bolt</b> has eight <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> in three rows that lock directly to the steel receiver. The gas system is fed from an adjustable gas port 11 inches {{from the rear of}} the barrel. Gas flows through a tube in the gas port where it impinges on the recessed face of the piston, which forms part of the operating rod assembly. Cyclic firing rate is 380 to 550 rounds per minute (RPM) depending on the gas system setting. Designers consider that while the Mendoza borrows much from both the Lewis and the Hotchkiss machine guns, the Model 1934 is a first-class design in its own right. In many ways, the Mendoza Model 1934 is what the American BAR should have been.|$|R
5000|$|The Remington Model 798 is a {{bolt-action rifle}} that was sold by Remington Arms from 2006 until 2008. The gun was {{made as a}} hunting rifle. It is {{composed}} of an imported Zastava Arms barreled action assembled with a laminated stock after import to the United States. It {{is based on a}} Mauser 98 action. It is chambered for [...]243 Winchester, [...]308 Winchester, [...]30-06 Springfield, [...]270 Winchester, 7mm Remington.Magnum, [...]300 Winchester.Magnum, [...]375 H&H Magnum and [...]458 Winchester.Magnum. It is drilled and tapped for scope mounts. It can have a barrel length of 22, 24 or 26 inches. It weighs 7 pounds, and has a brown laminated stock. The standard variant costs $599, and the Magnum versions can cost anything between $638 and $839. This is an all-steel, controlled-feed action using a flat-bottom receiver with an integral recoil lug, one-piece <b>bolt</b> with dual <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> plus a third safety lug and a bolt guide, full-length extractor, solid steel one-piece bottom iron/magazine box/trigger guard, hinged magazine floor plate, and all of the usual Mauser 98 deluxe features.|$|R
50|$|The IWI NEGEV is a gas-operated {{selective}} fire {{light machine}} gun that uses propellant gases from the barrel to cycle a short-stroke gas piston operating system under the barrel and a rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism. The <b>bolt</b> itself features 4 radial <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> that engage the barrel extension and its rotation is controlled by a pin on the bolt body, which rides inside a camming guide machined into the bolt carrier. The bolt contains a spring-powered casing extractor unit, while a lever ejector is housed inside the receiver (it is rotated by the recoiling bolt carrier).|$|R
50|$|The FNC is a {{selective}} fire weapon {{that uses a}} gas-operated long-stroke piston system and a rotating <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism equipped with two <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> that engage corresponding recesses in the barrel extension. The bolt is rotated and unlocked by {{the interaction of the}} bolt's cam pin with a camming guide contained in the bolt carrier. Overall, the mechanism strongly resembles that of Kalashnikov rifles, but adapted to more advanced design and production methods. The rear part of the cocking handle slot, cut in the upper receiver for the cocking handle, is covered by a spring-loaded cover which automatically opens by the handle when it goes back and automatically closes the opening when the cocking handle returns forward.|$|R
50|$|The upper {{receiver}} {{consists of}} a housing, in which a locking ring is permanently fixed, and a Picatinny rail as an interface to the rifle scope. Integrated in this scope mount rail is the rear part of the emergency iron sight, designed as factory zeroed flip-up sight. Into the above-mentioned <b>locking</b> ring, the <b>bolt</b> <b>locks</b> by rotation; thus, the receiver with <b>locking</b> ring, <b>bolt</b> and barrel form the breech of the rifle. The APR rifle has a traditional manually operated rotary bolt with three radial <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> at the front. The bolt requires only a 60° bolt rotation; both features should be appreciated by the shooter during multiple firings that require rapid projectile placement on the target.|$|R
5000|$|The {{bolt head}} of the Model 110 is a [...] "floating" [...] design: A flat spring located behind the front baffle and bolt head {{assembly}} gives the assembly {{a small amount of}} free movement lateral to the bore axis. This motion assures that the <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> fully contact the receiver and so headspace is held to a minimum every time the <b>bolt</b> is <b>locked.</b> This feature is a major factor contributing to the accuracy of the rifle.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{previous}} Schmidt-Rubin series of rifles, the K31's <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> <b>lock</b> up immediately behind the chamber. This forward {{positioning of the}} <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> affords several advantages. The entire action is strengthened as the <b>lugs</b> <b>lock</b> into the much thicker forward part of the receiver. Lock-up is also more precise.|$|R
50|$|Stronger lever actions, such as {{the action}} of the Marlin Model 1894 can utilize {{high-pressure}} cartridges. Lever-action designs with strong, rotary <b>locking</b> <b>bolts</b> ({{such as the}} Browning BLR with seven <b>locking</b> <b>lugs)</b> safely use very high-powered cartridges like the 300 Winchester mag, 300 WSM and 7 MM Remington magnum. Tilting block designs such as the Savage Model 99 are also strong enough to handle high pressures.|$|R
50|$|The Stoner 63 {{series of}} weapons are gas-operated, air-cooled, belt or magazine-fed and in rifle and carbine configuration, fire from a closed bolt to ensure maximum accuracy, or in machine gun mode, {{fire from the}} open bolt {{position}} to prevent cook-offs and enhance cooling. The weapon has a rotary <b>bolt</b> <b>locking</b> mechanism with 7 radially symmetrical <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> that engage a series of recesses in the barrel extension, and is actuated by a conventional long-stroke piston. The radial arrangement of <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> distributes the firing load evenly around the bolt head and barrel socket, reducing stress and increasing the longevity of these critical components. Attached to the piston extension is the bolt carrier which {{is equipped with a}} curved cam track that guides the bolt's cam pin (retained by the firing pin) and rotates the bolt 22.5° during the movement of the piston to either lock or unlock the bolt from behind the abutments in the barrel socket. Incorporated into the bolt carrier/piston group is an anti-bounce device, consisting of a 4 in carbide rod that rides within the piston extension’s hollow interior and moves back and forth during the recoil and counter-recoil cycles, reducing bolt bounce and preventing the possibility of firing out of battery during closed bolt firing (in the Rifle/Carbine models).|$|R
50|$|The <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> of K31 rifles {{can develop}} cracks {{that can be}} {{visually}} determined by the naked eye or {{with the help of}} a loupe. Rifles with substandard <b>locking</b> <b>lugs</b> should be immediately be redrawn from shooting and professionally repaired to prevent dangerous situations.|$|R
