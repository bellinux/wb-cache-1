5000|$|The {{species of}} {{wildlife}} threatened with extinction are: Jaguar, yaguareté, tapirs, mboreví, <b>bare-throated</b> <b>bellbird,</b> red parrot, harpy eagle or taguato, anteater or jurumí, giant armadillo or tatú cart, lies and others. [...] Rivers provide surubí, gold and pacú.|$|E

40|$|Faecal {{samples from}} a couple of <b>bare-throated</b> <b>bellbirds</b> Procnias nudicollis {{imported}} from Brazil to Barcelona Zoo contained oocysts of Isospora araponga n. sp. Sporulated oocysts were subspherical to broadly ellipsoidal, 19. 5 (17 - 22) × 15. 5 (14 - 16. 5) µm, shape index (length:width ratio) 1. 26 (1. 13 - 1. 38) with smooth and colourless bilayered wall, about 1 µm thick, and with varying number (1 - 3) of polar granule, but without a micropyle or residuum. The sporocysts were ellipsoidal, slightly asymmetric, 12. 5 (12 - 13) × 8. 5 (7. 5 - 9) µm with barely visible Stieda body and indistinguishable substieda body. Sporozoites were elongated, possessing smooth surface and two distinct refractile bodies. Key words: Isospora araponga n. sp. - Procnias nudicollis- Cotingidae- Brazil Members of the Cotingidae are frugivorous or insec-tivorous passeriform birds inhabiting forests of subtropi-cal and tropical America. So far, there were no species of coccidia reported from these hosts. The present study gives a description of a new species of Isospora from the bare throated bellbird Procnias nudicollis, species that is widely distributed from Brazil and Paraguay to Argentina...|$|R
50|$|The <b>bare-throated</b> <b>bellbird</b> (Procnias nudicollis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family Cotingidae. It is found in moist {{subtropical}} and tropical forests in Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. The male has white plumage and bristly bluish-black bare skin around its eye, beak and throat. The female is more drab, being olive-brown above with streaked yellow underparts. The male {{has one of the}} loudest bird calls known, producing a metallic sound similar to a hammer striking an anvil. This bird feeds on fruit and plays a part in dispersing the seeds of forest trees. It is considered a vulnerable species because of loss of its forest habitat and collection for the pet bird trade.|$|E
5000|$|Cecropia fruit, {{known as}} snake fingers, are a popular food of diverse animals however, {{including}} bats like the common fruit bat (Artibeus jamaicensis) or Carollia species, the Central American squirrel monkey (Saimiri oerstedii), and birds like the green aracari (Pteroglossus viridis), the keel-billed toucan (Ramphastos sulfuratus), the peach-fronted conure (Eupsittula aurea), the <b>bare-throated</b> <b>bellbird</b> (Procnias nudicollis) and particularly nine-primaried oscines. The seeds are not normally digested and thus {{these animals are}} important in distributing the trees.Some birds [...] - [...] e.g. the common potoo (Nyctibius griseus) [...] - [...] nest in Cecropia trees. The elfin-woods warbler (Setophaga angelae) is notable for using Cecropia leaves as nesting material, which no other New World warbler (family Parulidae) seems to do.|$|E
