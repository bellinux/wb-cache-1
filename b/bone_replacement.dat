25|$|Elastic modulus {{is simply}} {{defined as the}} ratio of stress to strain within the {{proportional}} limit. Physically, it represents the stiffness of a material within the elastic range when tensile or compressive load are applied. It is clinically important because it indicates the selected biomaterial has similar deformable properties with the material {{it is going to}} replace. These force-bearing materials require high elastic modulus with low deflection. As the elastic modulus of material increases fracture resistance decreases. It is desirable that the biomaterial elastic modulus is similar to bone. This is because if it is more than bone elastic modulus then load is born by material only; while the load is bear by bone only if it is less than bone material. The Elastic modulus of a material is generally calculated by bending test because deflection can be easily measured in this case as compared to very small elongation in compressive or tensile load. However, biomaterials (for <b>bone</b> <b>replacement)</b> are usually porous and the sizes of the samples are small. Therefore, nanoindentation test is used to determine the elastic modulus of these materials. This method has high precision and convenient for micro scale samples. Another method of elastic modulus measurement is non-destructive method. It is also clinically very good method because of its simplicity and repeatability since materials are not destroyed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Bone</b> <b>replacements</b> for {{congenital}} defects, cancer resections, and traumas {{are typically}} performed using bone grafting. However, due to scarcity {{of the source}} material, synthetic materials for <b>bone</b> <b>replacements</b> are sometimes used instead. Unfortunately, the ability to engineer anatomically correct pieces of viable and functional human bone are difficult and time-consuming through conventional manufacturing methods. This paper proposes an alternative route which incorporates the use of AM technology for fabricating patient-specific implants. The implants were computer-aided design (CAD) from a stereolithography (STL) file of a mandible. AM method was combined with lost wax casting (LWC) technology to produce the customised A-W glass-ceramic implants. An initial study of sintered A-W was performed on cylindrical samples show on average 19. 8 % porous with on average 75 % of the porosity being open and an average flexural strength of 82. 6 MPa. The A-W scaffoldsdisplay a degree of macro- and micro porosity. The geometrical shape of the A-W implants shows a close resemblance to the required implant. Additive manufacturing assisted fabrication of A-W glass-ceramic provides a promising method for manufacturing customised medical implants...|$|R

An important limitation of the current methods is heuristic ad hoc design of <b>bone</b> <b>replacements</b> by the operating surgeon {{at the time of}} surgery.

We tested the feasibility of using a multiresolution three-dimensional topological optimization to design replacements for massive midface injuries with bone loss. The final solution to meet functional requirements may be shaped differently than the natural human bone but be optimized for functional needs sufficient to support full restoration using a combination of soft tissue repair and synthetic prosthetics.

It is a second-generation calcium supplement derived from bovine bone. In the 1980s, bone meal calcium supplements {{were found to be}} contaminated with heavy metals, and although the manufacturers claim their MH is free from contaminants, people are advised to avoid it because its effect in the body has not been well-tested. However, the limited tests seem to show positive results. A 1995 randomized placebo-controlled study of 40 people in Europe found that it was more effective than calcium carbonate in slowing bone loss. A 2007 randomized double-blind controlled study of an MH supplement called the Bone Builder found significant positive effects in bone mineral density (BMD) compared to control.

This method examines thin cross sections of human remains, specifically long bones such as the femur and humerus and investigates areas of altered bone. As a human skeleton grows and matures during a lifetime, a condition similar to osteoporosis occurs naturally. Cells replacing decaying bone matter actually eat away at existing bone, creating fragments which increase with age. Counting the number of these fragments in a cross section shows a corresponding increase of the fragments with an increase {{in the age of the}} person. The <b>bone</b> <b>replacement</b> ceases upon a persons death. Kerley's published work on the matter in 1965, was based on the study of 126 specimens whose ages were already known by the Smithsonian Institution. In all but 11 specimens, the Kerley Method identified the remains within a margin of plus or minus 4.6 years. The subjects studied by Kerley ranged in age from 5 to 95. By the 1970s, the method was considered a standard in the field of Forensic anthropology for determination of age, and over 40 age determinations had been made, to even badly burned and disfigured remains with similar results.|$|E

While the scaffold composition is important for biocompatibility, the internal architecture {{plays a key role in}} allowing proper cell penetration, nutrient diffusion, bone ingrowth, vascularization as well as mechanical properties. A solid freeform fabrication is a promising processing technique, allowing to study structural parameters independently. This bachelor thesis is focused on ceramic <b>bone</b> <b>replacements</b> with different internal structure. The thesis is divided into 8 chapters. The first four chapters briefly summarize the current state of the art in the following fields: bone structure, requirements for synthetic <b>bone</b> <b>replacements,</b> scaffold architecture, and fabrication methods with an emphasis on 3 D printing. The next chapters deal with experimental part. The image analysis of mouse skeleton was performed. On the basis of the measured pore size (50 200 m) and according to the literature search, 16 structures with various shape, curvature and pore size were designed. The CAD models were printed by a stereolithography from a tricalcium phosphate dispersion. Sintered ceramic scaffolds exhibited an ideal structure for application in bone tissue engineering. Scaffolds contained both interconnected macro- and micropores of optimal sizes up to 500 m and about 3 m, respectively. The results confirm that stereolithography is suitable, and compared to others, precise method for preparing scaffolds having different internal structures. The individual structural characteristics influencing the scaffold behaviour will be possible to study independently to each other.

40|$|ABSTRACTTibial plateau {{fractures}} are joint lesions {{that require}} anatomical reduction of joint surface and functional restoration of mechanical axis {{of a lower}} limb.

The goal {{of this study was}} to characterise 4 and 6 mm CeraBall scaffolds in vitro with a view to their future use as <b>bone</b> <b>replacement</b> materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The proliferation of human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs) seeded on CeraBall scaffolds was evaluated quantitatively using the WST [Water soluble tetrazolium ((4 -[3 -(4 - Iodophenyl) - 2 -(4 -nitrophenyl) - 2 H- 5 -tetrazolio]- 1, 3 -benzene disulfonate) ] test and qualitatively by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In addition, the standard MTT [(3 -(4, 5 -Dimenthylthiazol- 2 -Y 1) - 2, 5 -Diphenyltetrazolium bromide) ] biocompatibility test and cell vitality staining were performed using hMSCs. CeraBall scaffolds were also tested for their mechanical properties. RESULTS: SEM and WST test results showed that hMSCs proliferated on CeraBall scaffolds over the course of 9 days. Proliferation was similar to that seen on tissue culture polystyrene (control). Cells showed a well-spread morphology and formed 'sheets' on the surface of scaffolds. Invasion of pores was observed. Good biocompatibility was demonstrated by MTT test results and cell vitality staining. Scaffolds of both 4 and 6 mm were able to withstand compressive loads of 5 N.
