5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, plantain, broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins {{are to be found in}} the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), <b>bay</b> <b>leaf,</b> mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E
5|$|The Provence and Côte d'Azur {{region is}} rich in quality citrus, vegetables, fruits, and herbs; the region {{is one of the}} largest {{suppliers}} of all these ingredients in France. The region also produces the largest amount of olives, and creates superb olive oil. Lavender is used in many dishes found in Haute Provence. Other important herbs in the cuisine include thyme, sage, rosemary, basil, savory, fennel, marjoram, tarragon, oregano, and <b>bay</b> <b>leaf.</b> Honey is a prized ingredient in the region. Seafood proliferates throughout the coastal area and is heavily represented in the cuisine. Goat cheeses, air-dried sausages, lamb, beef, and chicken are popular here. Garlic* and anchovies are used in many of the region's sauces, as in Poulet Provençal, which uses white wine, tomatoes, herbs, and sometimes anchovies, and Pastis is found everywhere that alcohol is served. The cuisine uses a large amount of vegetables for lighter preparations. Truffles are commonly seen in Provence during the winter. Thirteen desserts in Provence are the traditional Christmas dessert, e.g. quince cheese, biscuits, almonds, nougat, apple, and fougasse.|$|E

The {{period of}} the building's construction was adopted, using old photographs and engravings as sources, and paint analysis to replicate original colors, the interior spaces were returned closely to their 1875 appearance. Walls were repainted rose madder and the original Cummings and Sears' stencil patterns were recreated. The cupola was reopened, once more admitting light to the Sanctuary below.

25|$|In the Philippines, {{spaghetti}} {{is often}} {{served with a}} distinct, slightly sweet yet flavourful meat sauce (the base {{of which would be}} tomato sauce or paste and ketchup), frequently containing ground beef or pork and diced hot dogs and ham. It is spiced with some soy sauce, heavy quantities of garlic, dried oregano sprigs and sometimes with dried <b>bay</b> <b>leaf,</b> and afterwards topped with grated cheese. Other pasta dishes are also cooked nowadays in the Filipino kitchen, like carbonara, pasta with alfredo sauce, and baked macaroni. These dishes are usually cooked for gatherings and special occasions, like family reunions or Christmas. Macaroni or other tube pasta is also used in sopas, a local chicken broth soup.|$|E

The entrance hall contains a columned Doric screen with a 19th-century ribbed and bossed ceiling. The old dining room to the right of this features a coffered ceiling dated to the 17th century, containing [...] "low plaster relief mouldings including guilloché, acanthus and egg and dart". The chimney piece has been removed. The drawing room to rear of the property also features a richly adorned coffered ceiling with [...] "frieze bearing rosette bands" [...] and a [...] "centre oval with <b>bay</b> <b>leaf</b> design". The 17th-century staircase features thick balusters and prominent finials, with foliage patterns ingrained in the plasterwork of the handrail. [...] A billiard room was added to the house in 1896.

2500|$|In Indonesian cuisine, {{which is}} similar to Malay, the term kecap refers to {{fermented}} savory sauces.

Kecap manis is a sweet soy sauce that is a mixture of soy sauce with brown sugar, molasses, garlic, ginger, anise, coriander and a <b>bay</b> <b>leaf</b> reduced over medium heat until rather syrupy.

2500|$|When Old South's church {{opened in}} 1875 it {{looked very much}} as it does today, based upon the design of Cummings and Sears. The walls were {{decorated}} in polychrome stenciling in shades of complex tertiary colors: a rose madder background with overlays of ochre, <b>bay</b> <b>leaf</b> green, warm gray, and persimmon, and highlights of metallic gold. Most of the interior structure, except for the carved wood frieze along the balconies, was already in place by 1875. High above the crossing of the transepts and nave is the lantern, or cupola. The ceiling of the lantern was painted a deep Prussian blue with a pattern of gilded stars to represent the firmament of God. The limestone tracery of the west wall of the sanctuary, with its foliage and animals, combined with the highly carved foliated woodwork and the overhead representation of the nighttime sky was intended to echo God's creation. Above the doors on the east chancel walls are glass mosaics of {{the tree of life}} by Antonio Salviati. A third mosaic by Salviati originally hung in the tympanum above the tower's front doors. That mosaic was relocated to the vestibule when the tower was rebuilt 1922-1937. The combined effect was extremely rich; at once a spiritual and sensuous experience, and in great contrast to the chaste interior of Old South Meeting House on Washington Street. Stylistically the 1875 interior was in harmony with the Ruskinian Gothic exterior, and expressed Ruskin's ideal that it is “in art that the heart, the head, and the hand of a man come together.” ...|$|E

They are often labeled as [...] "Indian bay leaves," [...] or just [...] "bay leaf", causing confusion with the <b>leaf</b> from the <b>bay</b> laurel, a tree of Mediterranean origin in a different genus, and the appearance and aroma of the two are quite different. Bay laurel leaves are shorter and light to medium green in color, with one large vein {{down the length of}} the leaf, while tejpat leaves are about twice as long and wider, usually olive green in color, and with three veins {{down the length of the}} leaf.

40|$|Leaf {{growth of}} the {{seagrass}} Syringodium filiforme (Kütz., 1860) was determined using a new technique based on the growth of emergent leaves (EL method) and compared to the more labor intensive repeated measurements (RM) and demographic allometric age reconstruction techniques (DA). All three techniques were used to compare leaf growth dynamics of plants with different morphologies at two sites, a shallow water (0. 5 m) banktop and an adjacent deeper water (1. 5 m) environment in outer Florida <b>Bay,</b> Florida. <b>Leaf</b> formation rates (Leaf Plastochrone Interval or PI) determined using the EL and RM methods were nearly identical, with means of 20 and 21 d leaf– 1 at both sites, significantly faster than the 30 d leaf– 1 calculated using the DA method. The EL method produced the highest estimate of leaf growth, 1. 8 and 1. 9 cm d– 1 at the 0. 5 m and 1. 5 m sites, respectively, followed by the RM method (1. 3 and 1. 3 cm d– 1) and the DA method (1. 0 and 1. 1 cm d– 1). None of the methods detected differences in leaf PI, leaf growth or leaf fragmentation rates between sites. However, leaves at the 1. 5 m site typically retained intact leaf tips longer than those at the 0. 5 m site, and total leaf lifespan was longer at the 1. 5 m site. Based on these results {{and the amount of}} field and laboratory work required by each of the methods, the new EL method is the preferred technique for monitoring leaf growth in S. filiforme...|$|R

They are often highly localised and reflect the meat and vegetables available. They can therefore employ a variety of meats (chicken, beef, water buffalo and goat as in the flavoursome gulai kambing), seafood (such as prawn, crab, mussel, clam, and squid), fish (tuna, mackerel, carp, pangasius, catfish), or vegetables (young jackfruit, common beans, cassava leaf) dishes in a spiced sauce.
