The Acting High Commissioner summoned Mufti Haj Amin al-Husseini and informed {{him that he had}} never heard of such a demonstration being held at the Wailing Wall, and that it would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> shock to the Jews who regarded the Wall as a place of special sanctity to them. At the Wall, the crowd burnt prayer books, liturgical fixtures and notes of supplication left in the Wall's cracks, and the beadle was injured. The rioting spread to the Jewish commercial area of town.|$|E
25|$|Gopalan's hockey {{career was}} helped by Robert Summerhayes {{who was to}} hockey in Madras what Johnstone was to cricket. In 1935, he toured New Zealand with the Indian hockey team which enjoyed {{enormous}} success. The next year he was selected in the hockey team for the Berlin Olympics and the cricket team to tour England. It was known beforehand that Gopalan would have a small {{role to play in}} the England tour {{because of the presence of}} Mohammad Nissar and Amar Singh. Still he chose the latter, which turned out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> decision. The hockey team captained by Dhyan Chand, one of the finest teams in the history of the sport, won the gold medal with little difficulty. As it turned out, Gopalan did not play a Test in England. The tour was marred by internal politics and the team returned in disgrace.|$|E

However he later became better known as a director, with films such as Whistle Down the Wind (1961), The L-Shaped Room (1962) and The Stepford Wives (1975) among his best-known credits. Forbes later recalled of the film: “I {{was one of the people}} attacked by the alien pods. This pod exploded and I ended up with what was supposed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> alien growth on my face. Come lunchtime and we all went off to the pub.

In the episode, Marge {{tells the story of}} how she and Homer first met and fell in love. Flashing back to 1974, we see how Homer falls in love with Marge in high school and tries to get close to her by enlisting her as his French tutor. After several hours of verb conjugation, Marge falls for Homer too, only to become enraged when he admits that he is not a French student. Marge rejects Homer's invitation to the prom and goes with Artie Ziff. Artie turns out to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>terrible</b> date and Marge realizes that it is Homer she really wants.|$|E

[...] In the 1980s he advocated for the Soviet takeover of Turkey's formerly Armenian populated areas and its unification with Soviet Armenia.
