5000|$|The <b>black-backed</b> <b>puffback</b> (Dryoscopus cubla) is {{a species}} of {{passerine}} bird in the Malaconotidae family. They are common to fairly common sedentary bushshrikes in various wooded habitats in Africa south of the equator. They restlessly move about singly, in pairs or family groups, and generally frequent tree canopies. Like others of its genus, the males puff out the loose rump and lower back feathers in display, to assume a remarkable ball-like appearance. They draw attention to themselves by their varied repertoire of whistling, clicking and rasping sounds. Their specific name cubla, originated with Francois Levaillant, who derived it from a native southern African name, where the [...] "c" [...] is an onomatopoeic click sound. None of the other five puffback species occur in southern Africa.|$|E
40|$|Mixed-species {{foraging}} flocks {{were studied}} at Kichwa Tembo Camp {{on the edge}} the Masia Mara National Reserve in Kenya between July and September 2004. Observations were made on 29 mixed-species flocks, in which 24 species participated. African Paradise Flycatcher Terpsiphone viridis, <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Puffback</b> Dryoscopus cubla, Grey-backed Cameroptera Camaroptera brachyura, Collard Sunbird Hedydipna collaris and Cabanis’s Greenbul Phyllastrephus cabanisi were the most common participants in mixed-species flocks, as well as among the most frequently encountered bird species overall. The <b>Black-backed</b> <b>Puffback</b> was identified as the nuclear species in flocks due to their abundance and frequency {{with which they were}} followed by other species. Mixed-species flocks represent another niche dimension in this diverse bird community, but few of these species could be described as flock specialists; most of the birds observed in mixed-species flocks in this study were opportunistic attendant species, including the African Pygmy Kingfisher Ispidina picta, not previously described as joining mixed-species flocks...|$|E
