5|$|From the {{beginning}} of his tenure, he sought to distance himself from previous Directors-General and their administrations by criticising them in print and attempting to introduce new staff who had no loyalty to his predecessors. Assigned with a four-year contract, Wheeler attempted to recruit two archaeologists from Britain, Glyn Daniel and Stuart Piggott, to aid him in reforming the Archaeological Survey, although they declined the offer. He then toured the subcontinent, seeking to meet all of the Survey's staff members. He had drawn up a prospectus containing research questions that he wanted the Survey to focus on; these included understanding the period between the Bronze Age Indus Valley Civilization and the Achaemenid Empire, discerning the socio-cultural background to the Vedas, dating the Aryan invasion, and establishing a dating system for southern India prior to the sixth century CE. During his time in office he also achieved a 25 per cent <b>budget</b> <b>increase</b> for the Archaeological Survey, and convinced the government to agree to the construction of a National Museum of Archaeology, to be built in New Delhi.|$|E
25|$|In the Obama administration's {{proposed}} 2010 United States {{federal budget}} of February 2009, {{there was a}} proposed 9.5percent <b>budget</b> <b>increase</b> for the State Department and other international programs, from $47.2billion in fiscal year 2009 to $51.7billion in fiscal year 2010. By the time of Clinton's May 2009 testimony before the United States Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs, numbers had been restated following rounds of general federal budget cuts, and the proposed fiscal year 2010 budget request for the State Department and USAID was $48.6billion, a 7percent increase. That became the amount of increase that was obtained.|$|E

If there had been a <b>budget</b> <b>increase,</b> the 'stagflation' economy of the seventies would have cancelled it out.

25|$|On January 14, 2004, Bush {{announced}} a Vision for Space Exploration, {{calling for the}} completion of the International Space Station by 2010 and the retirement of the space shuttle while developing a new spacecraft called the Crew Exploration Vehicle under the title Project Constellation. The CEV would be used to return American astronauts to the Moon by 2018, with the objective of establishing a permanent lunar base, and eventually sending future manned missions to Mars. To this end, the plan proposes that NASA's <b>budget</b> <b>increase</b> by five percent every year until it is capped at US$18 billion in 2008, with only inflationary increases thereafter. The planned retirement of the Space Shuttle fleet in 2010 after the ISS is completed is also expected to free up US$5 billion to US$6 billion a year. The US$16.2 billion budget for 2005 proposed by NASA met with resistance from House and Senate spending committees, and the initiative was little-mentioned during the presidential campaign. Nonetheless, the budget was approved with only minor changes shortly after the November elections.|$|E

500|$|In November 1960, John F. Kennedy {{was elected}} {{president}} after a campaign that promised American superiority over the Soviet Union {{in the fields of}} space exploration and missile defense. Up to the election of 1960, Kennedy had been speaking out against the [...] "missile gap" [...] that he and many other senators felt had formed between the Soviets and themselves due to the inaction of President Eisenhower. Beyond military power, Kennedy used aerospace technology as a symbol of national prestige, pledging to make the US not [...] "first but, first and, first if, but first period." [...] Despite Kennedy's rhetoric, he did not immediately come to a decision on the status of the Apollo program once he became president. He knew little about the technical details of the space program, and was put off by the massive financial commitment required by a manned Moon landing. When Kennedy's newly appointed NASA Administrator James E. Webb requested a 30 percent <b>budget</b> <b>increase</b> for his agency, Kennedy supported an acceleration of NASA's large booster program but deferred a decision on the broader issue.|$|E

500|$|Due to its {{accessible}} location with favorable {{conditions for}} expansion, {{and a very}} high net migration, and population growth rates (estimated to be 29persons per 1,000 per year), Zaprešić is expecting an economic boom.

The tertiary sector is dominant with mainly retailing, and hospitality, and a smaller presence of tourism, as well as souvenir manufacturing) and financial services. The secondary sector is also present with ceramic industry (Inker), metalworking (Karbon Nova, Lanac, and Unija metali) and chemical industry (Messer Croatia plin, Montkemija). The primary sector mainly consists of agriculture, and is expected to continue shrinking. There are currently [...] of arable land for agricultural use, but the town's general urban plan anticipates an economic shift will lower the amount of agricultural use to [...] by 2015, thus speeding the process of suburbanization started by the expansion of Zagreb.

The city budget in 2008 amounted to HRK 198million.|$|E
500|$|Tensions between Dacko and Bokassa increased. In December 1965, Dacko {{approved}} a <b>budget</b> <b>increase</b> for Izamo's gendarmerie, but rejected the budget proposal for Bokassa's army. At this point, Bokassa told friends he was annoyed by Dacko's treatment and was [...] "going for a coup d'état". Dacko planned to replace Bokassa with Izamo as his personal military adviser, {{and wanted to}} promote army officers loyal to the government, while demoting Bokassa and his close associates. Bokassa realized he had to act against Dacko quickly, and worried that his 500-man army would be {{no match for the}} gendarmerie and the presidential guard. He was also concerned the French would intervene to aid Dacko, as had occurred after the 23 February 1964 coup d'état in Gabon against President Léon M'ba. After receiving word of the coup from the country's military chief of staff, Albert-Bernard Bongo, officials in Paris sent paratroopers to Gabon and restored M'ba to power in a matter of hours. Banza, who was then commander of the Camp Kassaï military base in northeast Bangui, offered Bokassa his support and persuaded the still-worried commander-in-chief to carry out the coup. He helped Bokassa lay out the plans for the coup, proposed to take place on 31 December 1965.|$|E

2500|$|Frog City's initial {{goal was}} to produce a [...] "playable build" [...] by March 2002, in {{preparation}} for a May announcement and fall release. This schedule was interrupted in February 2002, when Computer Games Magazine, a publication for which Steinmeyer worked as a columnist, opted to do a cover story on Tropico 2. The game was ultimately announced on March 1, 2002. While the preview received positive feedback and energized the team, Frog City was inspired by fan comments to expand the game, especially with regard to pirate captains. This necessitated a delay past the holidays and a <b>budget</b> <b>increase</b> of [...] "several hundred thousand", according to Steinmeyer. However, he was able to negotiate the new schedule and budget with the game's publisher.|$|E
2500|$|Pöck faced chronic {{budgetary}} problems, owing {{in large}} part due to obstructionism from Hungarians and liberal Germans in parliament, the former viewing naval matters as an Austrian concern, and the latter opposed to naval expansion {{in light of the}} reduced threat from Italy in the 1870s. Additionally, since he was not involved in Tegetthoff's victory at the Battle of Lissa in 1866, he lacked the personal prestige to command the respect of parliament. As a result, he had great difficulty securing the funding for new ironclad warships during his tenure. He finally won approval for a new ship, , in 1875 but he could not convince parliament to allocate funds for a sister ship he had planned to name Erzherzog Karl. Confronted with parliamentary unwillingness to strengthen the fleet further, Pöck resorted to subterfuge to acquire the funds he needed. In 1875, he asked for a <b>budget</b> <b>increase</b> to [...] "rebuild" [...] the three s. In fact, Pöck sold the old vessels for scrap, reusing only the machinery, armor plate, and other fittings in three new ships, which were given the same names to obscure Pöck's sleight of hand.|$|E

Health and sanitation benefits accumulated the longer participatory budgeting was used in a municipality.
