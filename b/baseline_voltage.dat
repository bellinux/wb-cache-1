50|$|In non-excitable cells, and in excitable {{cells in}} their {{baseline}} states, the membrane potential is {{held at a}} relatively stable value, called the resting potential. For neurons, typical values of the resting potential range from -70 to -80 millivolts; that is, {{the interior of a}} cell has a negative <b>baseline</b> <b>voltage</b> of a bit less than one-tenth of a volt. The opening and closing of ion channels can induce a departure from the resting potential. This is called a depolarization if the interior voltage becomes less negative (say from -70 mV to -60 mV), or a hyperpolarization if the interior voltage becomes more negative (say from -70 mV to -80 mV). In excitable cells, a sufficiently large depolarization can evoke an action potential, in which the membrane potential changes rapidly and significantly for a short time (on the order of 1 to 100 milliseconds), often reversing its polarity. Action potentials are generated by the activation of certain voltage-gated ion channels.|$|E

The {{majority of}} inspiratory neurons (21 / 34 = 61. 8 %), but not expiratory neurons (1 / 8 = 12. 5 %), expressed IA. In whole-cell and somatic outside-out patches IA activated at − 60 mV (half-activation voltage measured − 16. 3 mV) and only fully inactivated above − 40 mV (half-inactivation voltage measured − 85. 6 mV), indicating that IA can influence membrane trajectory at <b>baseline</b> <b>voltages</b> during respiratory rhythm generation in vitro. 4 -Aminopyridine (4 -AP, 2 mm) attenuated IA in both whole-cell and somatic outside-out patches. In {{the context of}} rhythmic network activity, 4 -AP caused irregular respiratory-related motor output on XII nerves and disrupted rhythmogenesis as detected with whole-cell and field recordings in the preBötC. Whole-cell current-clamp recordings showed that 4 -AP changed the envelope of depolarization underlying inspiratory bursts (i. e. inspiratory drive potentials) from an incrementing pattern to a decrementing pattern during rhythm generation and abolished current pulse-induced delayed excitation. These data suggest that IA opposes excitatory synaptic depolarizations at <b>baseline</b> <b>voltages</b> of approximately − 60 mV and influences the inspiratory burst pattern. We propose that IA promotes orderly recruitment of constituent rhythmogenic neurons by minimizing the activity of these neurons until they receive massive coincident synaptic input, which reduces the periodic fluctuations of inspiratory activity...|$|R
40|$|Phase change memory (PCM) is {{currently}} {{seen as the}} most promising candidate for a future storage-class memory {{with the potential to}} be as fast as Dynamic Random-Access Memory but with much longer retention times, and as dense as flash memory but significantly faster due to unique material properties which include strong electrical resistivity contrast, fast crystallization and high crystallization temperature. PCM devices utilize chalcogenide materials (most commonly Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5, or GST) that can be reversibly and rapidly switched between amorphous and crystalline phases (enabling storage of information) with orders of magnitude difference in electrical resistivity. Crystallization dynamics, transition temperatures, and grain size distributions depend on the material composition, interfaces and cell geometry and determine the electrical pulses required for operation, cell performance, power consumption and reliability. This work focused on temperature dependent characterization of GeSbTe thin films and nanoscale structures with the goal of contributing {{to a better understanding of}} phase-change memory materials and devices. The electrical resistivity of liquid GST (ρGST-Lq) was extracted from measurements on large number of individual GST nanostructures self-heated to melt by single microsecond voltage pulses, as well as on thin film samples. The crystallization behavior of GST films on silicon nitride and on silicon dioxide through slow resistance versus temperature measurements was also characterized. Silicon nitride appears to facilitate the fcc-hcp phase-transition of GST and we speculate this may be due to the hexagonal symmetry of silicon nitride. Our results also show the importance of the heating rate in determining phase transition temperatures. Understanding the crystallization dynamics is critically important for PCM device operation. Above a certain amplitude, a <b>baseline</b> (or offset) <b>voltage</b> after a melting pulse can play an important role in the set operation by leading to retention of a molten filament and growth-from-melt templated from the surrounding crystalline regions. The effect of different <b>baseline</b> <b>voltages</b> on the set dynamics of phase change memory devices was studied by applying melting voltage pulses with varying <b>baseline</b> <b>voltages.</b> Simulations of the effect of different <b>baseline</b> <b>voltages</b> were also performed to compare to and help interpret the experimental results. Lastly, in-situ X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) measurements up to high temperatures and ex-situ XRD measurements on pre-annealed samples were performed to characterize grain size distributions as a function of anneal temperature. The material crystallizes over time as the chuck temperature is increased and the crystallization process is monitored by the evolution of different peaks in the XRD measurement which are related to the grain sizes. These results will be used to improve and calibrate our electrothermal and crystallization models for PCM materials and devices. Kadir Cil - University of Connecticut, 201...|$|R

40|$|Oscillations {{between high}} and low values of the {{membrane}} potential (UP and DOWN states respectively) are an ubiquitous feature of cortical neurons during slow wave sleep and anesthesia. Nevertheless, a surprisingly small number of quantitative studies have been conducted only that deal with this phenomenon’s implications for computation. Here we present a novel theory that explains on a detailed mathematical level the computational benefits of UP states. The theory is based on random sampling by means of interspike intervals (ISIs) of the exponential integrate and fire (EIF) model neuron, such that each spike is considered a sample, whose analog value corresponds to the spike’s preceding ISI. As we show, the EIF’s exponential sodium current, that kicks in when balancing a noisy membrane potential around values close to the firing threshold, leads to a particularly simple, approximative relationship between the neuron’s ISI distribution and input current. Approximation quality depends on the frequency spectrum of the current and is improved upon increasing the <b>voltage</b> <b>baseline</b> towards threshold. Thus, the conceptually simpler leaky integrate and fire neuron that is missing such an additional current boost performs consistently worse than the EIF and does not improve when <b>voltage</b> <b>baseline</b> is increased. For the EIF in contrast, the presented mechanism is particularly effective in the high-conductance regime, which is a hallmark feature of UP-states. Our theoretical results are confirmed by accompanying simulations, which were conducted for input currents of varying spectral composition. Moreover, we provide analytical estimations of the range of ISI distributions the EIF neuron can sample from at a given approximation level. Such samples may be considered by any algorithmic procedure that is based on random sampling, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo or message-passing methods. Finally, we explain how spike-based random sampling relates to existing computational theories about UP states during slow wave sleep and present possible extensions of the model in the context of spike-frequency adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Voltage {{stability}} {{is a critical}} feature of an efficiently operating power distribution system such as a DC islanded microgrid. Large-scale autonomous power systems can be defined by heterogeneous elements, uncertainty and changing conditions. This paper proposes a novel scalable decentralised control scheme at the primary level of the typical hierarchical control architecture of DC islanded microgrids with arbitrary topology. Local state-feedback L_ 1 adaptive controllers are retrofitted to existing <b>baseline</b> <b>voltage</b> controllers of DC-DC boost converters, which interface distributed generation units with loads. The use of L_ 1 adaptive controllers achieves fast and robust microgrid voltage stability {{in the presence of}} dynamic uncertainty and plug-and-play operations.

40|$|We {{propose a}} CMOS circuit {{designed}} {{to be used with}} silicon drift detectors (SDDs) for high-resolution and high peak stability X-ray spectroscopy. The circuit is developed in the framework of a project for researches on exotic atoms (e. g., kaonic hydrogen) at e-/e+ colliders. The circuit is composed by a low-noise charge preamplifier, by a sixth-order semi-Gaussian shaping amplifier with four selectable peaking times from 0. 7 mus up to 3 mus, and by a bipolar shaping amplifier to provide a timing signal required by the experiment. The preamplifier operates with the input JFET directly integrated on the detector itself. A low-frequency current-mode feedback loop allows to stabilize the operating point of the input JFET with respect to background and leakage current variations. The feedback capacitor is also integrated on the detector. Because its value is not known precisely a priori, the preamplifier is designed with the possibility to adjust externally its decay time to match the fixed time constant of the pole/zero network.

40|$|ObjectivesThe goal of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the relationship of the ventricular tachycardia (VT) isthmus to channels of preserved voltage on an electroanatomic voltage map in postinfarction cardiomyopathy. BackgroundSubstrate mapping in patients with postinfarction cardiomyopathy and VT may involve lowering the voltage cutoff that defines the scar (< 1. 5 mV) to identify “channels” of relative higher voltage within the scar. However, the prevalence of channels within the scar identified by using electroanatomic mapping and the relationship to the protected VT isthmus identified by entrainment mapping is unknown. MethodsDetailed bipolar endocardial voltage maps (398 ± 152 points) from 24 patients (mean age 69 ± 9 years) with postinfarction cardiomyopathy (ejection fraction 33 ± 9 %) and tolerated VT were reviewed. Endocardial scar was defined according to voltage < 1. 5 mV. Isolated late potentials (ILPs) were identified and tagged on the electroanatomic voltage map. The <b>baseline</b> <b>voltage</b> cutoffs were then adjusted until all channels were identified. The VT isthmus was identified using entrainment mapping. ResultsInferior and anterior/lateral infarction was present by voltage mapping in 18 and 6 patients, respectively (scar area 44 ± 24 cm 2). By adjusting voltage cutoffs, 37 channels were identified in 21 (88 %) of 24 patients. The presence of ILPs within a channel was seen in 11 (46 %) of 24 patients and 17 (46 %) of 37 channels. A VT isthmus site was contained within a channel in only 11 of 24 patients or 11 of 37 channels. No difference in voltage characteristics was identified between clinical and nonclinical channels. Voltage channels with ILPs harbored the clinical isthmus with a sensitivity and specificity of 78 % and 85 %, respectively. ConclusionsChannels were identified in 88 % of patients with VT by adjusting the voltage limits of bipolar maps; however, the specificity of those channels in predicting the location of VT isthmus sites was only 30 %. The presence of ILPs inside the voltage channel significantly increases the specificity for identifying the clinical VT isthmus...|$|E
2500|$|The key to neural {{function}} is the synaptic signaling process, which is partly electrical and partly chemical. The electrical aspect depends on {{properties of the}} neuron's membrane. Like all animal cells, [...] the cell body of every neuron is enclosed by a plasma membrane, a bilayer of lipid molecules with many types of protein structures embedded in it. A lipid bilayer is a powerful electrical insulator, but in neurons, many of the protein structures embedded in the membrane are electrically active. These include ion channels that permit electrically charged ions to flow across the membrane and ion pumps that actively transport ions {{from one side of}} the membrane to the other. Most ion channels are permeable only to specific types of ions. Some ion channels are voltage gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by altering the voltage difference across the membrane. Others are chemically gated, meaning that they can be switched between open and closed states by interactions with chemicals that diffuse through the extracellular fluid. The interactions between ion channels and ion pumps produce a voltage difference across the membrane, typically a bit less than 1/10 of a volt at <b>baseline.</b> This <b>voltage</b> has two functions: first, it provides a power source for an assortment of voltage-dependent protein machinery that is embedded in the membrane; second, it provides a basis for electrical signal transmission between different parts of the membrane.|$|R
40|$|Human {{olfaction}} {{is still}} the primary instrument used in many industries to classify the smell or flavor of products. This is a costly process since trained experts are required who can only work for relatively short periods of time. Therefore using machine olfaction to perform the task would be a significant advance. Many researchers have investigated electronic noses, but currently only relatively large "instrument" electronic noses have been built. We have designed an electronic nose on a single silicon chip, including adaption, signal processing, and classification. The electronic nose chip is composed of four different stages: Sensor stage, Signal Processing stage, Database stage, and Classifier stage. The sensor stage, as its name suggests, deals with the sensor directly. The sensor we use is a carbon black-organic polymer whose relative resistance change {{is proportional to the}} given odor concentration. The function of the sensor stage is to adapt this resistive sensor to a preset baseline value, take the AC signal voltage, then output a current proportional to the signal voltage. So the sensor stage outputs a signal current which contains information about the odor concentration. An adaptive electronics stage, a peak detector, and a transconductance amplifier are designed to complete the sensor stage. Adaptive electronics are implemented to adapt the sensor to be within a proper working range of the circuit while tuning out the environment background. Adaption is done by constructing an adjustable current source. After adaption is done, the bias current value is held, so the sensor voltage at this time contains two different types of information: baseline value and signal value. The peak detector traces the input signal to its maximum value, then holds the value for further signal processing. This is needed because the signal voltage is defined as the difference between the maximum sensor <b>voltage</b> and the <b>baseline</b> sensor <b>voltage.</b> The transconductance amplifier converts voltage to current linearly while functioning as high pass filter. The output current is equal to {{the difference between the two}} input voltages multiplied by some gain (called transconductance). The output of the peak detector, the maximum sensor voltage, is used as the noninverting input, while the <b>baseline</b> sensor <b>voltage</b> is used as the inverting input. By the differential input characteristic of the transconductance amplifier, the baseline information is cancelled, and only the signal information remains. Thus, the output current from the transconductance amplifier contains the signal information, i. e., odor concentration. The signal processing stage performs two important tasks for further signal processing. First, normalization throughout the signal array is realized. Then the Euclidean distance between the signal vector and the data vector is calculated. A normalizer using city-blocks distance is designed and an Euclidean distance calculation circuit is built. A normalization circuit using city-blocks distance is implemented to generate a normalized signal vector. This normalized signal vector is stored in a SRAM through an A/D in the LEARNING State. On the other hand, in the CLASSIFYING state, Euclidean distance between the normalized signal vector and the data vector is calculated. Euclidean distance circuit is implemented to calculate the Euclidean distance between signal vector and data vector. The Euclidean distance is output in the form of a current. This distance measure is utilized for classification. The database stage stores the signal vector in the data storage device (LEARNING state) or outputs the data vector from the data storage device (CLASSIFYING state). This stage also takes care of the interface between the electronic nose chip and the outside world. A central control unit is designed to generate all the control signals and arrange the time sequence. Eight-bit Static Random-Access Memory (SRAM) is used for data storage. A/D converter is used to convert the signal vector into a digital word. This happens during the LEARNING process. A D/A converter is used to convert the data from SRAM into the data vector. This happens during the CLASSIFYING process. A current copier cell is designed to maintain the value of the data current. Several current copier cells are used to form a data vector. The central control unit is designed to generate all the control signals needed and their time sequence. The classifier stage receives all the Euclidean distances between signal vector and data vectors, and generates the output corresponding to the shortest Euclidean distance, while inhibiting all the other outputs. The generated output is denoted as the answer to the pattern recognition problem. The current copier cell in the database stage is used to maintain the value of the Euclidean distance current. Several current copier cells are used to generate inputs for the LTA circuit. The Loser-Take-All (LTA) is used for parallel classification.

In distal mouse colon, {{we have identified}} that both, a luminal P 2 Y(2) and a luminal P 2 Y(4) receptor, stimulate K(+) secretion. In this study, we investigate the effect of luminal adenosine triphosphate/uridine triphosphate (ATP/UTP) on electrogenic Na(+) absorption in distal colonic mucosa of mice treated on a low Na(+) diet for more than 2 weeks. Transepithelial electrical parameters were recorded in an Ussing chamber. <b>Baseline</b> parameters: transepithelial <b>voltage</b> (V (te)) : - 13. 7 +/- 1. 9 mV (lumen negative), transepithelial resistance (R (te)) : 24. 1 +/- 1. 8 Omega cm(2), equivalent short circuit current (I (sc)) : - 563. 9 +/- 63. 8 microA/cm(2) (n = 21). Amiloride completely inhibited I (sc) to - 0. 5 +/- 8. 5 microA/cm(2). Luminal ATP induced a slowly on-setting and persistent inhibition of the amiloride-sensitive I (sc) by 160. 7 +/- 29. 7 microA/cm(2) (n = 12, NMRI mice). Luminal ATP and UTP were almost equipotent with IC(50) values of 10 microM and 3 microM respectively. In P 2 Y(2) knock-out (KO) mice, the effect of luminal UTP on amiloride-sensitve Na(+) absorption was absent. In contrast, in P 2 Y(4) KO mice the inhibitory effect of luminal UTP on Na(+) absorption remained present. Semiquantitative polymerase chain reaction did not indicate regulation of the P 2 Y receptors under low Na(+) diet, but it revealed a pronounced axial expression of both receptors with highest abundance in surface epithelia. Thus, luminal P 2 Y(2) and P 2 Y(4) receptors and ENaC channels co-localize in surface epithelium.

40|$|Dielectric {{insulators}} {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} laboratory settings when performing experiments in rock mechanics, petrology, and electromagnetic studies of rocks in the fields of geophysics,material science, and civil engineering. These components may be used to electrically isolate geological samples from the experimental equipment, to perform a mechanical compliance function between brittle samples and the loading equipment, to match ultrasonic transducers, or perform other functions. In manyexperimental configurations the insulators bear the full brunt of force applied to the sample but do not need to withstand high voltages, therefore the insulators are often thin sheets of mechanically tough polymers. From an instrument perspective, transduction from various types of mechanical perturbation has beenqualitatively compared for a number of polymers [1, 2] and these error sources are readily apparent duringhigh-impedance measurements if not mitigated. However even when following best practices, a force dependent voltage signal still remains and its behavior is explored in this presentation. In this experimenttwo thin sheets (0. 25 mm) of high-density polyethylene (HDPE) were set up in a stack, held alternatelybetween three aluminum bars; this stack was placed on the platen of a 60 T capacity hydraulic testingmachine. The surface area, A, over which the force is applied to the PE sheets in this sandwich is roughly 40 square cm, each sheet forming a parallel-plate capacitor having roughly 320 pF [3], assuming therelative dielectric permittivity of PE is approximately 2. 3. The outer two aluminum bars were connected to the LO input ofthe electrometer and the central aluminum bar was connected to the HI input of a Keithley model 617 electrometer. Once the stack is mechanically well-seated with no air gaps, the voltage offset is observed tobe a linear function of the <b>baseline</b> <b>voltage</b> for a given change in applied force. For a periodically appliedforce of 66. 7 kN the voltage offsets were measured as a function of initial voltage, and these data were fitwith a linear function that was constrained to pass through the origin. The best fit solution had a correlation coefficient of R= 0. 85 and a slope of approximately - 0. 0228 volts/volt. The voltage offset when normalizedis demonstrated to be constant - 2. 28 % for both positive and negative polarities over nearly 3 orders ofbaseline voltage magnitude. From this, the voltage-force coefficient is derived to be - 0. 34 ppm/N. Thiscorrelates well to a first-order parallel plate capacitor model that assumes constant area, and smalldeformation such that the polymer may be mechanically modeled by a spring that obeys Hookes law.

40|$|The {{electronic}} nose is {{a rudimentary}} {{replica of the}} human olfactory system. However there has been considerable commercial interest {{in the use of}} electronic nose systems in application areas such as environmental, medical, security and food industry. In many ways the existing electronic nose systems are considerable inferior when compared to their biological counterparts, lacking in terms of discrimination capability, processing time and environmental adaptation. Here, the aim is to extract biological principles from the mammalian olfactory systems to create a new architecture in order to aid the implementation of a nose-on-a-chip system. The primary feature identified in this study was the nasal chromatography phenomena which may provide significant improvement by producing discriminatory spatio-temporal signals for electronic nose systems. In this project, two different but complimentary groups of systems have been designed and fabricated to investigate the feasibility of generating spatio-temporal signals. The first group of systems include the fast-nose (channel 10 cm x 500 μm 2), proto-nose I (channel 1. 2 m x 500 μm 2) and II (channel 2. 4 m x 500 μm 2) systems that were build using discrete components. The fast-nose system was used to characterise the discrete sensors prior to use. The proto-nose systems, in many ways, resembles gas chromatography systems. Each proto-nose system consists of two microchannels (with and without coating) and 40 polymer-composite sensors of 10 different materials placed along it. The second group of systems include the hybrid-nose and the aVLSI-nose microsensor arrays assembled with microchannel packages of various lengths (5 cm, 32 cm, 7 lcm, 240 cm) to form nose-on-a-chip systems. The hybrid-nose sensor array consists of 80 microsensors built on a 10 mm x 10 mm silicon substrate while the aVLSI-nose sensor array consists of 70 microsensors built on a 10 mm x 5 mm silicon substrate using standard CMOS process with smart integrated circuitries. The microchannel packages were fabricated using the Perfactory microstereolithography system. The most advanced microchannel package contains a 2. 4 m x 500 J. lm 2 microchannel with an external size of only 36 mm x 27 mm x 7 mm. The nose-on-a-chip system achieved miniaturisation and eliminates the need for any external processing circuitries while achieving the same capability of producing spatio-temporal signals. Using a custom-designed vapour test station and data acquisition electronics, these systems were evaluated with simple analytes and complex odours. The experimental results were in-line with the simulation results. On the coated proto-nose II system, a 25 s temporal delay was observed on the toluene vapour pulse compared to ethanol vapour pulse; this is significant compared to the uncoated system where no delay difference was obtained. Further testing with 8 analyte mixtures substantiated that spatio-temporal signals can be extracted from both the coated proto-nose and nose-on-a-chip (hybrid-nose sensor array with 2. 4 m long microchannel) systems. This clearly demonstrates that these systems were capable of imitating certain characteristics of the biological olfactory system. Using only the temporal data, classification was performed with principal components analysis. The results reinforced that these additional temporal signals were useful to improve discrimination analysis which is not possible with any existing sensor-based electronic nose system. In addition, fast responding polymer-composite sensors were achieved exhibiting response times of less than 100 ms. Other biological characteristics relating to stereolfaction (two nostrils sniffing at different rates), sniffing rate (flow velocity) and duration (pulse width) were also investigated. The results converge with the biological observations that stereolfaction and sniffing at higher rate and duration improve discrimination. Last but not least, the characterisation of the smart circuitries on the aVLSI-nose show {{that it is possible to}} achieve better performance through the use of smart processing circuitries incorporating a novel DC-offset cancellation technique to amplify small sensor response with large <b>baseline</b> <b>voltage.</b> The results and theories presented in this study should provide useful contribution for designing a higher-performance electronic nose incorporating biological principles...|$|E
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philiosphy (PhD) This thesis {{presents}} {{studies on}} the electrophysiological properties of Locus coeruleus (LC), a group of noradrenergic neurons present in the brain stem pons. The specific interest in this neuronal population came {{from the fact that}} this neuronal population accounts for the largest noradrenergic nucleus present in the brain, providing noradrenaline input to virtually all cerebral regions and involved in controlling or modulating many types of behaviours. Another important feature is the recent “rediscovery” that LC neurons are involved in Parkinson’s disease (PD), where loss of activity and/or decrease in the neuronal population are thought to be a fundamental step to the progression and maintenance of this pathology. LC neurons release many different types of neurotransmitters, noradrenaline, however, being the most studied. Regardless, of the neurotransmitter involved, release is controlled by intrinsic spontaneous firing activity, which {{is the result of a}} combination of pacemaker currents in balance with each other. These currents determine membrane depolarization and action potential initiation, and are responsible for adjusting the neuronal firing rate according to system needs. Even though the electrophysiological properties of LC neurons have been studied for decades, the mechanisms controlling and generating the pacemaker process need further investigation. As this process is a key feature underlying the influence exerted by LC neurons, a better understanding of this process is fundamental to determining how the brain functions and how impairment of LC activity may lead to neurological disorders. For example, it has been demonstrated in PD that along with the massive loss of Substantia Nigra (SN) neurons, the noradrenergic signalling provided by LC neurons to the SN also suffers a massive impairment. Recently, it was suggested that noradrenaline exerts a neuronal protective effect against oxidative stress and inflammation. This is of great significance, as oxidative stress and inflammation are thought to be significantly involved in the development and maintenance of PD. These finding led to the proposal that impairment in the noradrenergic signalling provided by LC neurons to the SN could be a trigger in the generation and progression of PD. All these facts inspired me to undertake detailed investigations into LC neuronal function. My aim was to first establish a solid understanding of the pacemaker process and then integrate this knowledge into a broader context. By choosing the mouse model this would allow future detailed studies using targeted mutants. I began by investigating the cellular basis of spontaneous firing of LC neurons with special emphasis on understanding the underlying pacemaker mechanisms, particularly those involved in action potential generation. In addition, I studied the effect of age and the possible involvement of mitochondria as a regulator of this process. The first research chapter (see chapter 3) presents a methodological approach that was found to significantly improve the viability of LC neurons. This facilitated our electrophysiological studies and should be of general use for all those investigating brain neurons in vitro. LC neurons are medium-sized cells with large dendritic arbours. As a result, achieving proper voltage control in voltage clamp experiments in slice preparations is a challenge. It was found that the ketamine-based anaesthesia improved neuronal viability by substantially increasing the membrane input resistance and rate of success in voltage clamp experiments. This was not only found to be the case for LC neurons but was also confirmed in another neuronal population, namely hypoglossal motor neurons. The second research chapter (chapter 4) characterizes the combination of pacemaker currents responsible for establishing depolarization during the interspike interval voltage range in mouse LC neurons. By using a series of voltage clamp approaches, I demonstrated that the composition of currents included a TTX-sensitive voltage-dependent Na⁺ conductance, a high TEA-sensitive K⁺ conductance, but no Ca²⁺ conductance. Interestingly, this complement of currents is different to rat LC neurons, the most studied LC preparation, which exhibit an important persistent pacemaker Ca²⁺ current close to the threshold for action potential initiation. A lack of a persistent Ca²⁺ current in mice could represent a significant temporal change in all Ca²⁺-dependent pathways giving a different perspective for cellular experiments carried out in the two species. This reminds us that direct comparisons between different animal species should be done with care. The third research chapter (chapter 5) investigates developmental changes in LC pacemaker currents. The two basic conductances (i. e. Na⁺ and K⁺), responsible for controlling the membrane depolarization underwent changes during development. However, once again there was no evidence for Ca²⁺ conductance in the pacemaker-interval voltage range in LC neurons, either infant or adult mice. Changes in the basic pacemaker currents were accompanied by other changes such as differences in TTX-insensitive spiking activity and the levels of <b>baseline</b> <b>voltage</b> noise. This chapter presents the first detailed report on the way development induces electrophysiological changes in mouse LC neurons. The fourth paper (chapter 6) of this thesis presents an investigation into the possible participation of mitochondria as an active modulator of LC pacemaking. Aspects of mitochondria were investigated for two main reasons: 1) they act as significant Ca²⁺ stores and are involved in controlling the intracellular Ca²⁺ dynamic in many different cells, hence they may impact on the pacemaking process of LC neurons; and 2) many neuropathologies such as PD have mitochondrial dysfunction as primary cause, thus the understanding of the role played by mitochondria in the pacemaking process could pave the way to discover new clinical approaches that may be beneficial at very early stages of the disease. Specifically, it was found that disturbance of mitochondrial metabolism activated Ca²⁺ channels that, in turn, activated K⁺ channels, which resulted in changes in the spontaneous firing activity of LC neurons. Two significant observations were made. The first was that Ca²⁺ channels activated by mitochondria were nifedipine sensitive, suggesting these were L-type Ca²⁺ channels. However, these voltage-dependent channels were activated at unusual hyperpolarized membrane potentials indicating an alternative pathway for their activation. The second observation was that activation of K⁺ channels involved Ca²⁺ entry but was independent of intracellular Ca²⁺ release. These findings are of significant interest since they demonstrate a pathway for K⁺ channel activation that is different than previously described by other investigators. Moreover, the fact that mitochondria may be involved in the pacemaker process, by not only buffering internal Ca²⁺ but also modulating ionic channels, indicates an exciting new perspective that could be applied to studies involving PD. In summary, this thesis has characterized conductances responsible for controlling neuronal pacemaking in infant and adult mouse LC. Investigations of inhibiting mitochondrial function led to the proposal that mitochondria may serve as fine tune regulators of LC pacemaking. These results constitute a detailed description of fundamental electrophysiological properties of mouse LC neurons, which provide a foundation for future LC studies using mutant mice and thus providing new insights into mechanisms that control LC pacemaking. Going still further, the results presented here can be applied to the study of the mechanisms underlying the progression of neurological diseases, such as PD, where there is direct involvement of LC neurons and their mitochondria...|$|E
40|$|In {{guinea-pig}} ventricular myocytes, {{in which}} the deactivation of slowly activating delayed rectifier potassium current (IKs) is slow, IKs can be increased by rapid pacing {{as a result of}} incomplete deactivation and subsequent current accumulation. Whether accumulation of IKs occurs in dogs, {{in which the}} deactivation is much faster, is still unclear. In this study the conditions under which accumulation occurs in canine ventricular myocytes were studied with regard to its physiological relevance in controlling action potential duration (APD). At <b>baseline,</b> square pulse <b>voltage</b> clamp experiments revealed that the accumulation of canine IKs could occur, but only at rather short interpulse intervals (< 100 ms). With action potential (AP) clamp commands of constant duration (originally recorded at rate of 2 Hz), an accumulation was only found at interpulse intervals close to 0 ms. Transmembrane potential recordings with high-resistance microelectrodes revealed, however, that at the fastest stimulation rates with normally captured APs (5 Hz) the interpulse interval exceeded 50 ms. This suggested that no IKs accumulation occurs, which was supported by the lack of effect of an IKs blocker, HMR 1556 (500 nM), on APD. In the presence of the beta-adrenergic receptor agonist isoproterenol (isoprenaline, 100 nM) the accumulation with AP clamp commands of constant duration was much more pronounced and a significant accumulating current was found at a relevant interpulse interval of 100 ms. HMR 1556 prolonged APD, but this lengthening was reverse rate dependent. AP clamp experiments in a physiologically relevant setting (short, high rate APs delivered at a corresponding rate) revealed a limited accumulation of IKs in the presence of isoproterenol. In conclusion, a physiologically relevant accumulation of IKs was only observed in the presence of isoproterenol. Block of IKs, however, led to a reverse rate-dependent prolongation of APD indicating that IKs does not have a dominant role at short cycle lengths. status: publishe...|$|R
