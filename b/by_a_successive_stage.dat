Classic mystical Bible commentaries are included in fuller versions of the Mikraot Gedolot (Main Commentators). Cordoveran systemisation is presented in Pardes Rimonim, philosophical articulation {{in the works of}} the Maharal, and Lurianic rectification in Etz Chayim. Subsequent interpretation of Lurianic Kabbalah was made in the writings of Shalom Sharabi, in Nefesh HaChaim and the 20th-century Sulam.

40|$|The {{magnesite}} and talc {{deposits of}} Kumaun Lesser Himalaya are confined within the Precambrian carbonate rocks of Deoban Formation (Valdiya, 1980). A regional picture of mineralization is obtained by selecting three small but crucial deposits viz. Jhiroli, Rema and Kanda {{in the district}} of Bageshwar of northeastern Kumaun. The stromatolitic dolomites that host the Veitsch type magnesite represents many microlithotypes and characterized by nodules and bands of chert. Magnesite is host to the widely distributed, high grade talc deposits. Grain boundary relations, replacement features and different phases of reactions between magnesite and silica explain development of talc in the system. The field and petrographic evidence aided with the fluid phase studies of limestone-dolomite-magnesite-quartz-talc assemblage suggest chronology in terms of <b>successive</b> <b>stages</b> of mineral formation. The three <b>successive</b> <b>stages</b> are characterized by different diagenetic minerals and progressive timing with relation to burial and compaction. The dolomite of the study area characterizes first stage replacement of calcite precursor. A low saline aqueous fluid with composition H 2 O+NaCl+KCl+MgCl 2, and peak of fluid activity at about 220 ºC participated in this replacement. Presence of both Mg 2 + and Ca 2 + ions in the system represent equilibrium between fluids and host mineral. At <b>a</b> <b>successive</b> <b>stage,</b> magnesite was formed replacing early formed dolomite. Such replacement is evident in petrography wherein magnesite replaced dolomite along the cleavage, micro fractures and grain boundaries.

50|$|The Hasidic movement, {{that began}} in 18th Century Eastern Europe, brought a mystical revival and the first popularisation of Jewish mysticism for the masses. Hasidism adapts {{historical}} Kabbalistic thought in its own characteristic ways, and {{can be seen as}} <b>a</b> <b>successive</b> <b>stage</b> of the Jewish mystical tradition. This democratisation of mysticism for everyone involved both outer expressions in fervour, and inner depths in Kabbalistic interpretation. Outwardly, the Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, awakened popular mystical joy and dveikut, appreciation of sincerity, new emphasis on prayer, and cherished encouragement of simple folk. The new doctrine of the Hasidic Rebbe, embodied in charismatic hagiographic storytelling, personified Divinity for the common folk. Hasidic philosophy articulated an internalisation of the esoteric structures in historical Kabbalah, so that they could awaken new dimensions of spirituality for both the elite scholars and the simple laypeople. This related Kabbalistic metaphysics to its corresponding faculties in natural psychological perception. While the focus of historical Kabbalah was on transcendent Divine emanations through the descending Chain of Worlds, the focus in Hasidic philosophy was the essential Divine Omnipresence expressed immanently, intimately accessible to each person. The simple, unlettered folk could reach this directly through their heartfelt sincerity, while elite scholars were attracted to Hasidism as they saw in its thought a new soulful dimension to previous Rabbinic and Kabbalistic interpretation.|$|R
