5|$|The {{continuing}} {{success of}} the OAO program encouraged increasingly strong consensus within the astronomical community that the LST should be a major goal. In 1970, NASA established two committees, one to plan the engineering side of the space telescope project, {{and the other to}} determine the scientific goals of the mission. Once these had been established, the next hurdle for NASA was to obtain funding for the instrument, which would be far more costly than any Earth-based telescope. The U.S. Congress questioned many aspects of the proposed <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> telescope and forced cuts in the <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> planning stages, which at the time consisted of very detailed studies of potential instruments and hardware for the telescope. In 1974, public spending cuts led to Congress deleting all funding for the telescope project.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{stayed on}} as {{president}} of the UCR, leaving after the party's defeat in the 1991 legislative elections. Suffering damage to its image because of the hyperinflation of 1989, the UCR lost in several districts. Alfonsín became president of the party again in 1993. He supported the creation of a special <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> province of Buenos Aires, led by governor Eduardo Duhalde. The radical legislator Leopoldo Moreau supported the new budget even more vehemently than the Peronists. Both parties had an informal alliance in the province. Alfonsín also supported the amendment to the constitution of Buenos Aires that allowed Duhalde to run for re-election.|$|E

The school budget was rejected again in 2009, with the Council cutting $1 million from the $94.8 million originally proposed. After the 2010 school budget failed, the Township Council removed $6.1 million from the $95 million budget proposed by the school district, zeroing out {{what would have been}} an 8.2% increase in the school tax levy. The school board eliminated 77 positions to meet the cuts approved by the council.|$|E

5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} his {{tax reform}} plan, and {{late in the}} session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> remainder of the biennium, abolished the state's public campaign finance laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.|$|E

The two had previously assisted Ron Gilbert with the creation of The Secret of Monkey Island and , and the studio felt that Grossman and Schafer were ready to manage a project. The company believed that the pair's humor matched well with that of Maniac Mansion and suggested working on a sequel. The two developers agreed and commenced production. Gilbert and Gary Winnick, the creators of Maniac Mansion, collaborated with Grossman and Schafer on the initial planning and writing. The total <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game was about $600,000, according to Schafer.|$|E

5|$|Funding was {{a problem}} from the outset. No {{producer}} was willing to finance the film, as it lacked stars, songs and action scenes. On learning of Ray's plan, one producer, Mr Bhattacharya of Kalpana Movies, contacted Bandopadhyay's widow to request the filming rights and get the film made by Debaki Bose, a well-established director. The widow declined as she had already permitted Ray to make the film. The estimated <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> production was 70,000 (about US$14,613 in 1955). One producer, Rana Dutta, gave money to continue shooting, but had to stop after some of his films flopped.|$|E

Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor than it was when he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E

5|$|Preliminary work on L.A. Noire {{began after}} the {{founding}} of developer Team Bondi in 2003. Though Team Bondi oversaw development, work was shared between the core team and multiple other studios owned by publisher Rockstar Games. Unlike other games published by Rockstar, L.A.

BBC News reporter Kev Geoghegan estimated that the development <b>budget</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> game exceeded US$50 million, making L.A.
