2500|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, several writers {{published}} arguments against Jesus' historicity, often {{drawing on the}} work of liberal theologians, who tended to deny any value to sources for Jesus outside the New Testament and limited their attention to Mark and the hypothetical Q source. They also made use of the growing field of religious history which found sources for Christian ideas in Greek and Oriental mystery cults, rather than Judaism. Joseph Klausner wrote that biblical scholars [...] "tried their hardest to find in the historic Jesus something which is not Judaism; but in his actual history they have found nothing of this whatever, since this history is reduced almost to zero. It is therefore no wonder that at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century</b> there has been a revival of the eighteenth and nineteenth century view that Jesus never existed".|$|E
2500|$|Within the {{premises}} of the Dhakeswari there are temples of two types of architecture. The ancient one is of the Poncharotna Goddess Durga's which lost its actual look after the renovation work. Bradly Bird wrote this at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century.</b> The present temple is two hundred years old which was built by an agent of East India Company. Most probably he had renovated the temple. Other than this there are four Shib Temples. According to hearsay, in the 16th century King Mansing built these temples by laying four Shib Lingas there. But this information seems to be unreliable. The fusion of Bangla chowchala and shikor temple is notice in the architecture of Dhakeshawri. Ratan Lal Chakraborti in an article mentioned that [...] " [...] the structure and architecture of {{it is like a}} Buddhist Pagoda". From this he assumed that the temple was probably built in the 10th century.|$|E

2500|$|Through all of {{the history}} of {{literature}} and of the arts in general, works of art are for a large part repetitions of the tradition; to the entire history of artistic creativity belong plagiarism, literary theft, appropriation, incorporation, retelling, rewriting, recapitulation, revision, reprise, thematic variation, ironic retake, parody, imitation, stylistic theft, pastiches, collages, and deliberate assemblages. Much art has been and is repetitive. The concept of absolute originality is a contemporary one, born with Romanticism; classical art was in vast measure serial, and the [...] "modern" [...] avant-garde (at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century)</b> challenged the Romantic idea of [...] "creation from nothingness," [...] with its techniques of collage, mustachios on the Mona Lisa, art about art, and so on.}} There is no rigorous and precise distinction between practices like imitation, stylistic plagiarism, copy, replica and forgery.

2500|$|A {{unimodal}} approach dominated {{scientific literature}} until the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century.</b> Although this enabled rapid progression of neural mapping, and an improved understanding of neural structures, {{the investigation of}} perception remained relatively stagnant, with a few exceptions. [...] The recent revitalized enthusiasm into perceptual research is indicative of a substantial shift away from reductionism and toward gestalt methodologies. Gestalt theory, dominant in the late 19th and early 20th centuries espoused two general principles: the 'principle of totality' in which conscious experience must be considered globally, and the 'principle of psychophysical isomorphism' which states that perceptual phenomena are correlated with cerebral activity. Just these ideas were already applied by Justo Gonzalo in his work of brain dynamics, where a sensory-cerebral correspondence is considered {{in the formulation of}} the [...] "development of the sensory field due to a psychophysical isomorphism" [...] (pag. 23 of the English translation of ref.). [...] Both ideas 'principle of totality' and 'psychophysical isomorphism' are particularly relevant in the current climate and have driven researchers to investigate the behavioural benefits of multisensory integration.|$|E

In about the middle of the first century CE, a revitalized Eastern Han (25-220 CE) slowly recovered these territories, driving the Xiongnu back into the Altai Mountains and the steppes north of the Gobi.

60|$|The <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> twentieth <b>century</b> {{happens to}} {{coincide}} with a very interesting phase in that great development of means of land transit {{that has been the}} distinctive feature (speaking materially) of the nineteenth century. The nineteenth century, when it takes its place with the other centuries in the chronological charts of the future, will, if it needs a symbol, almost inevitably have as that symbol a steam engine running upon a railway. This period covers the first experiments, the first great developments, and the complete elaboration of that mode of transit, and the determination of nearly all the broad features <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>century's</b> history may be traced directly or indirectly to that process. And since an interesting light is thrown upon the new phases in land locomotion that are now beginning, it will be well to begin this forecast with a retrospect, and to revise very shortly the history of the addition of steam travel to the resources of mankind.|$|R

That a mere one-third increase in gene numbers could be enough to progress from a rather unsophisticated nematode [Caenorhabditis elegans, with about 20, 000 genes (2) ] to humans (and other mammals) is certainly quite provocative and will undoubtedly trigger scientific, philosophical, ethical, and religious questions throughout the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new <b>century.</b> By the same token, humans appear only five times as complex as a bacterium like Pseudomonas aeruginosa (3). Although a significant uncertainty is still attached to this low number (see below), it was not totally unexpected, after the downward trend initiated by the analysis of the first two complete human chromosomes (4, 5), as well as two independent statistical studies (6, 7), and the unexpectedly low (14, 000) Drosophila gene number (8).
