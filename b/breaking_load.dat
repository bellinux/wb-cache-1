40|$|To {{characterize}} {{the decrease in}} ductility caused by an induced stress concentration {{as a function of}} various levels of cold work and heat treatment, Nitinol medical guide wires with a. 004 ″ diameter were tested using both a standard, straight tensile test and a modified, bent tensile test. The ratio of the two <b>break</b> <b>loads</b> (bent:straight) for identically processed samples was used as a proxy for measuring the ductility of the guide wires: the higher the ratio, the more ductile the sample. The average <b>break</b> <b>load</b> ratio as a function of increased cold work, decreased from 1. 27 to 0. 91 for the heat treated samples, and decreased from 1. 28 to 1. 13 for the non-heat treated samples. The heat treated wires had lower <b>break</b> <b>load</b> ratios - a difference of 0. 105 on average - compared to the similarly cold worked, non-heat treated wires. The magnitude of the decrease in <b>break</b> <b>load</b> ratio between heat treated and non-heat treated wires is dependent on the level of cold work; there was a difference of 0. 01 for the lowest level of cold work, and a difference of 0. 22 for the highest level of cold work. The decrease in <b>break</b> <b>load</b> - and ductility by proxy - from increased cold work and heat exposure is caused by the suppression of the austenite-martensite phase transformation {{as a result of these}} processes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractCertain {{surface defects}} of {{significant}} depth with maximum linear indication of 20 mm at the weld area {{have been observed}} during Liquid Penetrant Inspection (LPI) of the Inclined Fuel Transfer Machine (IFTM) welded chain. The same {{has been subjected to}} fatigue and <b>break</b> <b>load</b> testing to ascertain its structural integrity under service conditions. Two specimens have been subjected for testing to get repeatable experimental observations. Both the specimens tested for the required number of fatigue cycles (97000 cycles as per ASME, Mandatory Appendix 6) towards the structural integrity demonstration. At the end of fatigue testing, the maximum linear indication of the surface defect of the weld area increased from 20 mm to 25 mm without any loss of integrity. Individual links of both the chains were able to articulate freely after completing the fatigue test. After completing the required fatigue cycle both the specimens were subjected to <b>break</b> <b>load</b> testing. The lowest <b>break</b> <b>load</b> obtained from both the specimen was 27. 1 t and the respective collapse load obtained as per the ASME double slope method was 22 t. The above results indicated that, IFTM chain assembly qualifies for the safety with very high margins. Also, these experimental results give confidence that, collapse load obtained by the ASME double slope method is having a very high margin (∼ 18 %) with the actual <b>break</b> <b>load.</b> Finite element analysis has also been performed before conducting the experiment to understand the overall stress distribution of the chain under load condition and also to identify the critical location.

This load represents a force that is much less than that required to make the lifting equipment fail or yield, {{also known as the}} Minimum <b>Breaking</b> <b>Load</b> (MBL). SWL or WLL are calculated by dividing MBL by a safety factor (SF). An example of this would be a chain that has a MBL of 2000 lbf (8.89 kN) would have a SWL or WLL of 400 lbf (1.78 kN) if a safety factor of 5 (5:1, 5 to 1, or 1/5) is used.|$|E
50|$|The service {{behaviour}} {{is another}} aspect of great interest because it represents the overall material response to load conditions occurring during the entire life span of the structure. The result {{of this type of}} test represents a fundamental input data for the software used for structural analysis and the determination of the stress distribution in the structure.The biaxial behaviour at <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> is an important open issue that has not been investigated thoroughly until now. Previous researches demonstrate the difficulties concerning the rupture of a biaxial sample, it has been noted that generally the maximum biaxial tensile strength is lower than the corresponding ultimate tensile strength obtained by means of a monoaxial test. However, the test can be focused on the resistance of a joint, evaluating the strength of welded (high frequency welding, hot element welding), glued and sewn seams or the resistance of clamping plates and Keder rail joints or looped and laced joints.|$|E
5000|$|The next crucial {{stage is}} load application. This {{issue has been}} widely {{investigated}} {{but there is no}} loading path universally adopted by the testing laboratories. It has to be said that the loading cycles mainly depend on the scope of the test and it is unrealistic to consider the possibility of elaborating a single loading path able to fulfil at the same time all the requirements imposed by the investigation of the initial behaviour, the service behaviour, the behaviour at <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and long term behaviour. This part of the procedure should provide a valid approach to the establishment of a load profile, describing the effects of the parameters involved, in order to fully investigate the material response according to the required repeatability.Since coated fabrics do not follow an elastic behaviour, once the stress is removed the sample maintains a certain level of permanent strain, a plastic deformation. This behaviour is known as residual strain and is present both in monoaxial and biaxial tests. The main value of residual strain is shown {{between the first and second}} load cycle, decreasing to zero after a number of cycles that depends on the material properties, the applied load and the time for which it has been applied. This is due to the creep of the yarns and the coating material and to the internal frictional effects. In order to obtain a realistic description of the material the strain should be measured within a unique load cycle, assuming equal to zero the strain at pre-stress. For this reason the loading cycle considered for the strain measure is generally preceded by identical cycles in a number sufficient to stabilise the sample response. In order to remove the residual strain previous researches considered adequate the application of five identical loading and unloading cycles, the TensiNet design guide consider three or five repetitions to be sufficient, depending on the testing protocol. While the Membrane Structures Association of Japan [...] prescribes the repetition of the cycles three times, but only for the 1:1 load ratio which separates the others. This offers several advantages in the comparison of readings carried out within the same test and with other tests.|$|E

50|$|The {{bridge was}} {{designed}} by Dr William Brown (16 September 1928 - 16 March 2005). Brown was a structural engineer and bridge designer who specialised in suspension bridges. He {{was one of the}} principal designers at Freeman Fox & Partners (now Hyder Consulting) from 1956-85. Supervising engineer on the project was Dr Oleg Kerensky and the architect on site was R.E. Slater. There were several firms who constructed the bridge between 1967-71. The structural engineering was done by Freeman Fox & Partners and the steel fabrication was completed by Fairfields-Mabey. W.A.Fairhurst and Partners (now Fairhurst) designed and oversaw construction of the concrete piers and foundations. Christiani & Nielsen, Lehane Mackenzie and Shand Ltd were the contractors for the foundations and piers. The steel cable supplier was Bridon International. Force Technology were responsible for wind tunnel testing of the bridge. Steel was used to construct the deck and pylons and the piers are made from concrete. The road surface is mastic asphalt and consists of a two-lane dual carriageway and cycle/footpaths on each side. It has a 305 m main span and two 110 m approach spans. The width of the road deck is 31.25 m. Pylon height is 38 m high. The total length of the bridge including approaches is 1321.87 m. The clearance of the bridge is 45 m. The weight of the steel is 11,700 tonnes. 1250 miles of galvanised wire with a <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of 500 tonnes were used during construction. The bridge has 15 spans in total and rests on 14 diamond shaped piers which have been designed to allow air to circulate freely around them. The deck and piers have been designed to flex with temperature changes. In the event of the bridge traffic numbers increasing the cycle tracks can be configured to include a third lane. There are 4 water mains pipes and 2 gas pipes running the full length of the underside of the bridge. It is the only bridge in Scotland with single cables over central main supports and was in this respect a precursor of the Millau Viaduct in France. At the time of building it was the longest bridge of its type in the world. The bridge cost including approaches was £10.5million. HRH Princess Anne opened the bridge on 2 July 1971. The ceremonial plaque of the opening can be seen on the railings of the western footpath, at the centre of the main span. Whilst the bridge was being constructed, the West Gate Bridge in Australia also designed by Freeman Fox & Partners, collapsed. An investigation published on 14 July 1971 found faults in the design. The reason for collapse was a difference in camber between 2 girders on the west span. The Erskine Bridge had already opened but needed further stiffening to meet new standards established due to the collapse of the West Gate Bridge.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1977 The {{purposes}} of this study were: to compare the strength (single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load),</b> the elongation and the evenness of four types represented by 11 brands of polyester sewing threads available on the market in Corvallis, Oregon in January, 1976; to determine whether there were differences in the strength and elongation of black and white threads; and to find the correlations between: the single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and the loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> of a thread; the single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and the elongation of a thread; and the <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and the evenness of a thread. The four types of thread were: corespun polyester/cotton 2 -ply, corespun polyester/cotton 3 -ply, short staple spun polyester and tow spun polyester. Some differences were observed among different types and among various brands within the same type of thread in every property that was investigated. In comparing the single strand breaking loads, corespun 3 -ply threads were significantly stronger than the corespun 2 -ply thread of the same brand; corespun 3 -ply threads exhibited no significant differences from tow spun threads; short staple spun threads were significantly weaker than corespun 3 -ply and tow spun threads. Comparisons of loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> indicated that tow spun threads still performed best, followed by short staple spun threads. Corespun 3 -ply threads were weaker than both tow spun threads and short staple spun threads. The corespun 2 -ply thread was the weakest of all. Corespun 3 -ply threads had better extensibility than the corespun 2 -ply thread and the short staple spun threads; short staple spun threads, in turn, were more extensible than tow spun threads. With a few exceptions, no significant differences in the <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and elongation of black and white thread occurred. The evenness of all 11 brands of thread was similar. Based on this study, the tow spun threads would be a good choice for fabrics with normal extensibility. Two of the three corespun 3 -ply threads would be suitable for fabrics which stretch more. No significant correlations were found between: single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and loop breaking load; single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and evenness; and loop <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and evenness. Although a high positive correlation between single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and elongation was not significant at the. 05 level, the relationship appears fruitful for further study because only the tow spun threads and one of the short staple spun threads had a much lower rate of elongation relative to the single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load...</b>|$|E

40|$|Characterization of {{material}} properties {{is necessary for}} design purposes {{and has been a}} topic of research for many years. Over the last several decades, much {{progress has been made in}} identifying metrics to describe fracture mechanics properties and developing procedures to measure the appropriate values. However, in the context of design, there has not been as much success in quantifying the susceptibility of a material to corrosion damage and its subsequent impact on material behavior in the framework of fracture mechanics. A natural next step in understanding the effects of corrosion damage was to develop a link between standard material test procedures and fatigue life in the presence of corrosion. Simply stated, the goal of this investigation was to formulate a cheaper and quicker method for assessing the consequences of corrosion on remaining fatigue life. ^ For this study, <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> specimens and fatigue specimens of a single nominal gage (0. 063 ″) of aluminum alloy 2024 -T 3 were exposed to three levels of corrosion. The <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> specimens were taken from three different material lots, and the fatigue tests were carried out at three stress levels. All failed specimens, both <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> and fatigue specimens, were examined to characterize the damage state(s) and failure mechanism(s). Correlations between <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> results and fatigue life results in the presence of corrosion damage were developed using a fracture mechanics foundation and the observed mechanisms of failure. Where <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> tests showed a decrease in strength due to increased corrosion exposure, the corresponding set of fatigue tests showed a decrease in life. And where <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> tests from different specimen orientations exhibited similar levels of strength, the corresponding set of fatigue specimens showed similar lives. The spread from shortest to longest fatigue lives among the different corrosion conditions decreased at the higher stress levels. Life predictions based on <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> data were generally shorter than the experimental lives by an average of 20 %. The life prediction methodology developed from this investigation is a very valuable tool for the purpose of assessing material substitution for aircraft designers, alloy differentiation for manufacturers, or inspection intervals and aircraft retirement schedules for aircraft in service. ...|$|E

Microscopic examination revealed that two brands were core spun and seven were tow spun type threads. Data resulting from the standard testing procedures were tested statistically by analysis of variance or the Student's "t" test. Associations were determined by Pearson's correlation coefficient. Differences occurred among and within both the brands {{and the types of}} thread. Single strand <b>breaking</b> <b>load</b> varied significantly only among the tow spun black threads. The loop breaking strength of the tow spun threads was greater than that of the core spun threads.

A significant variation in single strand elongation occurred among the white threads and the black threads of both the tow spun and core spun threads. Variation in loop breaking elongation existed among the brands. Variation in loop breaking elongation also occurred among the white tow spun threads and between the black core spun threads. The core spun threads exhibited more shrinkage than the tow spun threads. Seams sewn with the white tow spun threads were stronger than those sewn with the white core spun thread.

The mechanical properties depend on the metabolic phase of the graft material—degeneration, revascularization, fibroplasia, and maturation of the collagen.

In this way the allograft serves as a scaffold for collagen formation, while it is fully substituted by vital collagen.
