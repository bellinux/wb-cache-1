Tests were conducted using a four-bladed articulated rotor {{mounted on the}} NASA-Army aeroelastic rotor experimental system (ARES). Two rotor configurations were tested: one consisting of a blade set with flexible fiberglass spars and one with stiffer (by a factor of five in flapwise and torsional stiffnesses) aluminum spars. Both blade sets were identical in planform and airfoil distribution and were untwisted. The two configurations were ballasted to the same Lock number so that a direct comparison of the tracking sensitivity to a gross change in blade stiffness could be made. Experimental results show no large {{differences between the two}} sets of blades in the {{sensitivity of}} the <b>blade</b> <b>tracking</b> to root pitch adjustments.

40|$|In this master thesis, a flow {{visualization}} {{experiment and}} a <b>blade</b> <b>tracking</b> experiment have been conducted. The {{aim of the}} thesis has been to assess {{the performance of the}} new blade tow tank rig at the Fluid Mechanics Lab at NTNU. The <b>blade</b> <b>tracking</b> experiment involved reconstructing the trajectory of the blade and analyzing the blade's vibrations. The flow visualization experiment involved analyzing the tip vortices produced {{in the wake of the}} blade. This experiment is conducted by injecting dye into the tank near the tip of the blade. A LabVIEW program has been created to accurately control the blade in the tank, through sending signals to the two stepper motors controlling the traversing and rotational motion of the blade. The program is designed to allow the user to quickly pick a specific velocity and acceleration of the blade, and thus a specific tip speed ratio (λ). The <b>blade</b> <b>tracking</b> experiment was able to accurately reconstruct the trajectory of the blade. It also yielded some interesting results regarding the error associated with camera focus (depth of field). The results were, however, inconclusive regarding the nature of the blade vibrations. The flow visualization experiment produced images of the tip vortices at different values of λ. The expected result that is increasing λ decreases the strength of the tip vortices was also found, by comparing the change in intensity for the different scenarios. The overall result of confirming the usability of the rig is important, because it opens up the possibility for many future research projects. By creating procedures for creating tip vortices as well as analyzing the trajectory of the blade, this thesis might prove to be an important step in much research in the years to come. Since the strength of the tip vortices is closely linked to the wake recovery length, the results from this thesis further proves the potential for improving wind farm efficiency. The results also proved the importance of high-quality imagery, as it turned out the cameras' frame rate and depth of field proved detrimental to the result of the <b>blade</b> <b>tracking</b> experiment...|$|E

40|$|Advanced {{helicopter}} rotor {{systems are}} designed with non-metallic composite materials for fatigue strength and low radar signature for reduced observability. They incorporate non-metallic composite <b>blades</b> and non-metallic <b>tracking</b> tabs. Adjustment of the existing non-metallic tracking tabs is complex and inefficient since it requires heating and cooling a thermoplastic tab material for each track adjustment. Several track-tab adjustments are required until optimum tracking is achieved. In this paper, a method for achieving direct in-flight incremental adjustment of the tracking tab is presented. The method utilizes a special tab material that can be remotely activated by the pilot from the cabin while in forward flight. This material is a composite consisting of shape memory alloy (SMA) wires embedded into a polymeric matrix. The activation of the SMA composite tab is done through electric current controlled from the pilot cabin and sent through conductors along the <b>blade</b> to the <b>tracking</b> tab. The proposed method will achieve in-flight tracking tab adjustment, will minimize the adjustment cycles and will reduce by at least a factor of ten the total tracking time. The implementation of the proposed incrementally adjustable in-flight tracking tab will rapidly minimize the once-per-rev helicopter vibration forward flight. This will lead to reduced crew fatigue, increased component life, and reduced maintenance for the helicopter. Additionally, the proposed method will also be serve as emergency system to reduce unbalanced vibrations due to ballistic damage of the rotor blade...|$|R

40|$|Turbine blades are {{the most}} common cause of {{failures}} in gas turbines. Failure modes are typically cracking from foreign object damage (FOD), high cycle stress (HCF), blade rubbing, degradation from erosion and corrosion. Fault detection of blades is important function in reducing blade related failures. This study involved the use of vibration analysis and dynamic testing of blades for failure detection. Current field inspections of blades are based on visual inspections only, and the intent here was to use impact testing of the blades during these inspections to determine cracked blade (from the vibration response). Vibration impact tests were undertaken using decommissioned turbine blades with and without cracks in the laboratory. Four common crack patterns were deliberately induced to the turbine blades to investigate changes in the blades normal mode response. Finite element analysis (FEA) of the blades was also undertaken. FEA results were correlated to experimental results and these results showed that each crack pattern was unique and significant changes were found in higher modes. Dynamic vibration analysis was also undertaken in a laboratory testrig fitted with rotating model straight blades. Vibration measurements were undertaken on a baseline test case and other test conditions where the blades had induced cracks. Steady state and transient vibration responses were obtained from the controlled tests. Vibration measurements were on the machine casing and on a blade (with an accelerometer surfaced mounted onto a rotating <b>blade).</b> Order <b>tracking</b> analysis and continuous wavelet analysis were performed to the measured data. Both techniques showed ability in detecting changes in vibration response on the blades and casing for blades with cracks. Results showed that significant changes were detected during transient analysis as compared to the steady state. Changes were noted in the vibration response corresponding to the machine running speed and blade passing frequencies. Changes in wavelet maps were however qualitative in nature, which suggested that more work need to be undertaken for cracks severity assessment using wavelet maps...|$|R
40|$|This report {{examines}} {{the effects on}} broadband noise generation of unsteady coupling between a rotor and stator in the fan stage of a turbofan engine. Whereas previous acoustic analyses treated the blade rows as isolated cascades, the present work accounts for reflection and transmission effects at both <b>blade</b> rows by <b>tracking</b> the mode and frequency scattering of pressure and vortical waves. The fan stage is modeled in rectilinear geometry {{to take advantage of}} a previously existing unsteady cascade theory for 3 D perturbation waves and thereby use a realistic 3 D turbulence spectrum. In the analysis, it was found that the set of participating modes divides itself naturally into "independent mode subsets" that couple only among themselves and not to the other such subsets. This principle is the basis for the analysis and considerably reduces computational effort. It also provides a simple, accurate scheme for modal averaging for further efficiency. Computed results for a coupled fan stage are compared with calculations for isolated blade rows. It is found that coupling increases downstream noise by 2 to 4 dB. Upstream noise is lower for isolated cascades and is further reduced by including coupling effects. In comparison with test data, the increase in the upstream/downstream differential indicates that broadband noise from turbulent inflow at the stator dominates downstream noise but is not a significant contributor to upstream noise...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to {{investigate}} how the design of solar cells could be improved {{so that they could}} become a more reliable source of energy. The first design change considered was shape manipulation, in which a normal photovoltaic array would be changed from a flat panel to either a cylindrical, parabolic, or spherical light-capture device. The idea is to change the cell or panel so that as much light is absorbed as possible. The second idea explored was to use a home water heating system in conjunction with the solar cells in order to control temperature fluctuation within the solar array, thus optimizing efficiency. The use of wiper blades, similar to windshield wiper systems in cars, was proposed as our third idea in order to remove any snow or debris {{from the surface of the}} panels. Other changes considered included the use of light-manipulation methods, such as Fresnel lenses, to enhance solar flux, prisms, which would be used to redirect light towards an array of solar cells, and one way glass, Recommendations • Final Design • Cylindrical solar cells • Solar Home Heating/Cooling System • Wiper <b>Blades</b> • Sun <b>Tracking</b> • Implementation • Private Homes • Businesses 1.

40|$|In {{contrast}} to an aircraft’s propeller {{the wake of}} a helicopter’s main rotor interacts very strongly with the rotor itself, giving rise to a number of problems that can only be addressed if the geometry and intensity of the wake is known {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. There are three largely different approaches to this issue: CFD-methods appear to be the most wholesome approach, however sufficient vortex preservation is today only achievable with ultra-fine meshes, resulting in very high computational cost that prohibit the everyday use as a design tool. Prescribed wake models situated on the other side of the cost spectrum use global inflow parameters to deform the wake. The third pillar is a vortex-lattice-method called Freewake. Here the shed vortices of the rotor <b>blade</b> are explicitly <b>tracked</b> and their induction on each other and the blade itself is computed using Biot-Savart’s law. They do not suffer from numerical dissipation of vortices, while still being very fast compared to full-fledged CFD methods. They are typically operated on small to medium sized clusters and are therefore subject to the associated administrative overhead. The Institute of Flight Mechanics of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) operates an advanced prescribed wake model which is capable of simulating most standard steady-state flight-conditions with a good degree of accuracy. This cheap and fast method is the reason why the institute’s Freewake code has been used sparingly in the past. That being said, many cases like transient maneuvers, flight in the turbulent atmosphere and dissimilar blades cannot be represented by prescribed wake codes and Freewake solutions are needed. The Freewake code of the DLR Institute of Flight Systems was developed in the 1990 s for massively parallel computations on distributed memory systems. Research of rotor dynamics would greatly benefit from regular, cheap and easy use of Freewake methods. This would be possible if one could run the Freewake on a workstation and so do away with all the external costs and the cumbersome administration. This talk focusses on DLR’s effort to create a Freewake compliant to these restraints. Since the original development of the code computational power has increased exponentially, but not enough that the original code could be directly used with satisfactory running time. To reduce the computational cost sufficiently to bring the DLR Freewake calculation to a single workstation, the existing code was extensively revised. Apart from various optimizations, the existing MPI-parallelization was enhanced by an openACC branch to use GPGPU accelerators to further reduce the time to solution. The talk starts with general issues of rotor-aerodynamics and the wake description. Then the Freewake approach used and the performance gain achieved thus far are discussed. The lessons learned with bringing the problem to GPGPU are presented. Closing an overview over several future enhancements is given...|$|R
