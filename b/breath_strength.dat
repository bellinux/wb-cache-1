60|$|At last he was down. They rushed on him, {{kneeling}} on him. He had neither <b>breath</b> nor <b>strength</b> to move. His face was bleeding {{with a long}} scratch, his brow was bruised.|$|R
60|$|For {{this purpose}} it was {{necessary}} that he should recover the <b>breath</b> and <b>strength</b> which his previous efforts had cost him. So he still waited, and looked {{in the face of}} the enemy.|$|R
60|$|Jack {{bent over}} the sick man, who {{said in a low}} whisper, with {{occasional}} pauses for <b>breath,</b> for his <b>strength</b> was almost gone.|$|R
60|$|It {{can well}} be {{supposed}} {{that we did}} not waste any time at this last work; the perspiration was running down our faces in tiny streams when the craft was finally as far up the narrow water-way as she could be taken, and then all hands were so exhausted that we threw ourselves on the deck to regain <b>breath</b> and <b>strength.</b>|$|R
60|$|La Bijou veered {{out into}} the stream, and their paddles, {{flashing}} mechanically in the sunshine, held her to the return angle across the river. As time and matter came back to them, and Split-up Island dawned upon their eyes like the foreshore of a new world, they settled down to the long easy stroke wherein <b>breath</b> and <b>strength</b> may be recovered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Abbe Foucquet," [...] said Juliette after a while, [...] "his is {{the kind}} of devotion which I feel sure will never be found under the new regimes of anarchy and of {{so-called}} equality. He would have laid down his life for my father or for me. And I know that he would never part with the jewels which I entrusted to his care, whilst he had <b>breath</b> and <b>strength</b> to defend them." ...|$|R
60|$|Once {{more they}} set to work, Sam {{watching}} them {{while trying to}} get back his <b>breath</b> and <b>strength.</b> Soon the last of the loose stones were removed from the hole, and they came upon a thin metallic slab having in the center a small ring. They pulled the slab up and disclosed a small square opening, in the middle of which rested a metallic box, about {{a foot and a half}} square and a foot in depth. The box was so heavy they could scarcely budge it.|$|R
60|$|Lying {{upon the}} wet mud and seaweed, for {{the tide was}} luckily at about half-ebb, I strove desperately to regain my <b>breath</b> and my <b>strength</b> so that I might have both at command if by some chance the lobster backs got an inkling of my whereabouts.|$|R
5000|$|Gary (voiced by Steve Carell) - Gary is Ace's [...] "sidekick" [...] and protégé, and {{the younger}} of the duo. Gary is less experienced, and has fewer superhuman powers than Ace. His powers include superhuman <b>strength,</b> <b>breath,</b> stamina, flexibility, flight (though Ace and Gary use the phallic-shaped Duocar more often than they fly), and [...] "laser vision." ...|$|R
500|$|Contemporary critics {{often found}} the work scandalous {{due to its}} sexual themes. A few years earlier Fuseli had fallen for a woman named Anna Landholdt in Zürich, while {{travelling}} from Rome to London. Landholdt was the niece of his friend, the Swiss physiognomist Johann Kaspar Lavater. Fuseli wrote of his fantasies to Lavater in 1779; [...] "Last night I had her in bed with me—tossed my bedclothes hugger-mugger—wound my hot and tight-clasped hands about her—fused her body and soul together with my own—poured into her my spirit, <b>breath</b> and <b>strength.</b> Anyone who touches her now commits adultery and incest! She is mine, and I am hers. And have her I will.…" ...|$|R
60|$|If {{he could}} but have drawn his knife, {{he would have}} stood a better chance in that hand-to-hand conflict. But {{there was no time}} now for such tactics as those. Besides, even in close fight with a bloodthirsty savage, an English gentleman's sense of fair play never for one moment deserts him. Felix felt, if they were to fight it out face to face for their lives, they should fight at least on a perfect equality. Steel against stone was a mean advantage. Parrying Tu-Kila-Kila's first desperate blow with the haft of his own hatchet, he leaped aside half a second to gain <b>breath</b> and <b>strength.</b> Then he rushed on, and dealt one deadly {{downstroke}} with the ponderous weapon.|$|R
60|$|The Duke and his {{companion}} proceeded in silence. She tried to hasten, {{but he felt}} her limbs shake upon his arm. He stopped: no one, not even a servant, was near. He could not leave her for an instant. There she stood trembling, her head bent down, and one hand clasping the other, which rested on his arm. Terrible was her struggle, {{but she would not}} faint, and at length succeeded in repressing her emotions. They were yet a considerable way from the house. She motioned with her left hand to advance; but still she did not speak. On they walked, though more slowly, for she was exhausted, and occasionally stopped for <b>breath</b> or <b>strength.</b>|$|R
6000|$|I {{could not}} answer because I had no <b>breath.</b> All my <b>strength</b> was gone. Still I sat up, {{supporting}} myself {{with my hand}} and hoping that it would come back. Quilla turned her face towards me, or rather towards the sound that I had made in moving, and I thought to myself how sad {{it was that she}} should be blind. Presently she spoke again and now her voice quavered: ...|$|R
60|$|The guide laughed, {{promised to}} have a care of Mabel, {{and in a few}} minutes the father had ascended a steep acclivity and {{disappeared}} in the forest. The others took another direction, which, {{after a few minutes of}} a sharp ascent also, brought them to a small naked point on the promontory, where the eye overlooked an extensive and very peculiar panorama. Here Mabel seated herself on a fragment of fallen rock to recover her <b>breath</b> and <b>strength,</b> while her companion, on whose sinews no personal exertion seemed to make any impression, stood at her side, leaning in his own and not ungraceful manner on his long rifle. Several minutes passed, and neither spoke; Mabel, in particular, being lost in admiration of the view.|$|R
50|$|The three minds, with no {{privacy and}} never {{alone in the}} one body, had a great shared power: the dracolich's flight, <b>strength,</b> <b>breath</b> and an aura of death and disease, the militant and {{strategic}} mind - as well as psionic powers - of the mind-flayer, and the Crystal Shard's necromantic powers and patience combined. Seeking revenge on those responsible for his blindness, the mind of Hephaestus immediately {{set his sights on}} Jarlaxle Baenre.|$|R
6000|$|She {{was leaning}} against the {{pedestal}} of a statue in the garden, panting, shuddering, a sight to touch the heart of a far less sensitive man than the man who now approached her. [...] "Sydney!" [...] he said. [...] "Dear little Sydney!" [...] She tried to speak to him in return. <b>Breath</b> and <b>strength</b> failed her together; she lifted her hand, vainly grasping at the broad pedestal behind her; she would have fallen if he had not caught her in his arms. Her head sank faintly backward on his breast. He looked at the poor little tortured face, turned up toward him in the lovely moonlight. Again and again he had honorably restrained himself--he was human; he was a man--in one mad moment it was done, hotly, passionately done--he kissed her.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{animated}} series Superman: The Animated Series, Justice League and its sequel Justice League Unlimited, Superman possesses {{the powers of}} super strength, speed, flight, x-ray vision, heat vision, wind and freeze breath, super hearing and sight, and incredible resistance to harm, though he seldom uses his heat vision or <b>breath.</b> Superman's <b>strength</b> is shown {{to be able to}} completely overwhelm Darkseid, forcing the Darkseid resort with directed energy. In [...] "Speed Demons", it is shown that Superman's speed is roughly on par with the Flash, with the latter's reflexes being greater. The episode [...] "The Late Mr. Kent" [...] reveals that Superman does not need to eat, though he does out of habit. In the episode [...] "Knight Time", he is shown to have microscopic vision as well as the ability of voice mimicry (not related to his Kryptonian powers, but a practiced skill) as he successfully mimics Batman and Robin's (Tim Drake) voices while posing as the Dark Knight.|$|R
60|$|It is {{as little}} worth {{remarking}} any farther upon all their drawing and re-drawing, on their circulation for putting off the evil day, {{on the play}} between the Treasury and the Caisse d'Escompte, and on all these old, exploded contrivances of mercantile fraud, now exalted into policy of state. The revenue will not be trifled with. The prattling about the rights of men will not be accepted in payment of a biscuit or a pound of gunpowder. Here, then, the metaphysicians descend from their airy speculations, and faithfully follow examples. What examples? The examples of bankrupts. But defeated, baffled, disgraced, when their <b>breath,</b> their <b>strength,</b> their inventions, their fancies desert them, their confidence still maintains its ground. In the manifest failure of their abilities, they take credit for their benevolence. When the revenue disappears in their hands, they have the presumption, in some of their late proceedings, to value themselves on the relief given to the people. They did not relieve the people. If they entertained such intentions, why did they order the obnoxious taxes to be paid? The people relieved themselves, {{in spite of the}} Assembly.|$|R
2500|$|On {{a number}} of {{occasions}} in the Chronicles of Narnia, Aslan uses his <b>breath</b> to give <b>strength</b> to characters, demonstrating his benevolent power of bringing life. He specifically does so in The Magician's Nephew when a 'long warm breath' gives life to Narnia. Lewis used the symbol of the breath to represent the Holy Spirit, also known as the Holy Ghost. Both 'spirit' and 'ghost' are translations of the word for breath in Hebrew and Greek. The flash from the stars when the Narnian animals are given the ability to talk also most probably represents the Holy Spirit or [...] "breath of life" [...] of Genesis chapter2, as well as (possibly) the scholastic concept of the divine active intellect that inspires human beings with rationality.|$|R
30|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{popularity}} of DL increased significantly after the term “deep learning” was first introduced {{in the context of}} NNs in 2000 [9]. However, the attractiveness of DNN started decreasing shortly after due to the experienced difficulty of training DNNs using BP (e.g. vanishing gradient problem), in addition to the increasing competitiveness of other ML techniques (e.g. SVM) [169]. Hinton’s work on Deep Belief Networks (DBN), published in 2006 [188], gave a new <b>breath</b> and <b>strength</b> to research in DNNs. DBN introduced an efficient training strategy for deep learning models, which was further used successfully in different classes of DNNs [49, 381]. The development in ML –particularly, in DNNs– grew exponentially with advances in storage capacity and large-scale data processing (i.e. Big Data) [169]. This wave of popularity in deep learning has continued to this day, yielding major research advances over the years. One approach that is currently receiving tremendous attention is Deep RL, which incorporates deep learning models into RL for solving complex problems. For example, Deep Q-Networks (DQN) –a combination of DNN and Q-learning– was proposed for mastering video games [318]. Although the term Deep RL was coined recently, this concept was already discussed and applied 25 years ago [275, 440].|$|R
6000|$|I {{had been}} intently {{watching}} the excited speaker; {{but as he}} regretfully added those last words I turned again, and Robert's eyes met mine,--those melancholy eyes, so full of an intelligence that proved he had heard, remembered, and reflected with that preternatural power which often outlives all other faculties. He knew me, yet gave no greeting; {{was glad to see}} a woman's face, yet had no smile wherewith to welcome it; felt that he was dying, yet uttered no farewell. He was too far across the river to return or linger now; departing thought, <b>strength,</b> <b>breath,</b> were spent in one grateful look, one murmur of submission to the last pang he could ever feel. His lips moved, and, bending to them, a whisper chilled my cheek, as it shaped the broken words,-- ...|$|R
60|$|Above him the seagulls screamed, {{circling}} {{round the}} fringe of the incoming tide, and the sound being entirely mortal recalled him to himself. On the instant he stepped back a few quick steps, for as yet only his feet were merged in the soft sand. As he did so the other figure stepped forward, and coming within the deadly grip of the quicksand began to sink. It seemed to Markam that he was looking at himself going down to his doom, and on the instant the anguish of his soul found vent in a terrible cry. There was at the same instant a terrible cry from the other figure, and as Markam threw up his hands the figure did the same. With horror-struck eyes he saw him sink deeper into the quicksand; and then, impelled by what power he knew not, he advanced again towards the sand to meet his fate. But as his more forward foot began to sink he heard again the cries of the seagulls which seemed to restore his benumbed faculties. With a mighty effort he drew his foot out of the sand which seemed to clutch it, leaving his shoe behind, and then in sheer terror he turned and ran from the place, never stopping till his <b>breath</b> and <b>strength</b> failed him, and he sank half swooning on the grassy path through the sandhills.|$|R
60|$|Eustacie {{was glad}} he had broken the spell of silence; for having {{recovered}} her husband, her first instinct was to wait upon him. She took the child from him, explaining {{that she was going}} to put her to bed in her own rooms up the stone stair, which for the present were filled with fugitive women and children who had come in from the country, so that the chancel must continue the lodging of Berenger and his brother; and for the time of her absence she brought him water to wash away the stains, and set before him the soup she had kept warm over her little charcoal brazier. It was only when thus left that he could own, in answer to Philip's inquiries, that he could feel either hunger or weariness; nay, he would only acknowledge enough of the latter to give a perfect charm to rest under such auspices. Eustacie had dispatched her motherly cares promptly enough to be with him again just as in taking off his corselet he had found that it had been pierced by a bullet, and pursuing the trace, through his doublet, he found it lodged in that purse which he had so long worn next his heart, where it had spent its force against the single pearl of Ribaumont. And holding it up to the light, he saw that it was of silver. Then there returned on him and Philip the words they had heard two days before, of silver bullets forged for the destruction of the white moonlight fairy, and he further remembered the moment's shock and blow that in the midst of his wild amaze on the river's bank had made him gather his <b>breath</b> and <b>strength</b> to bound desperately upwards, lest the next moment he should find himself wounded and powerless.|$|R
5000|$|Known {{for taking}} the stage at early concerts with {{hundreds}} of clothespins attached to his hair and clothes, Haynes would often strip throughout a show until he was down to his underwear, or less, by the end. Other attire included flasher-style trench coats over his nakedness, ridiculously home-styled wigs and cross-dressing; often enjoying a skirt made of an American flag and a large '60s torpedo-style stuffed bra. At other times he would hide condoms full of stage blood in his clothes and repeatedly fall to the floor, appearing to bleed profusely. Some of Haynes' other favorite tricks involved throwing handfuls of photocopied cockroach images into the crowd, rolls and rolls of toilet paper tossed across the audience, as well as filling an inverted cymbal with lighter fluid, setting it (and sometimes his hand) on fire, and repeatedly hitting it with a mallet. As previously mentioned he would sing through almost anything that would alter his voice, including toilet paper rolls and megaphones early on, which eventually evolved into [...] "Gibby's kit", a.k.a. [...] "Gibbytronix," [...] a rack of vocal effects stacked as high as he could reach, before which he would often stand {{for the majority of}} the show in later performances. He also often utilized various foot switches which would be used to activate certain vocal effects, and when thought to be dancing during some performances he would actually be stepping on his various pedals. Adding to the spectacle were Coffey and Nervosa, who played in unison on stand-up drum kits; behind which they would collapse onto the floor and out of eyeshot, to collect their <b>breath</b> and <b>strength</b> before rising just in time to play the next song. Finally, the whole band would often tear apart stuffed animals while on stage.|$|R
