Meanwhile, Zorg arrives, shooting and seriously wounding Leeloo <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> carrying case that he presumes contains the stones back to his spacecraft, leaving behind a time bomb that forces the liner's occupants to evacuate.

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature {{designated}} the primary northsouth roadway {{along the west}} bank of the Hudson River from the New Jersey state line near New York City to Albany, now largely US9W, as Route3, an unsigned legislative route. When the first set of posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, all of legislative Route3 became part of the new NY10, which initially began at the New Jersey state line and ended in Saranac Lake. North of Albany, the route followed modern NY5, NY50, and NY9N through Schenectady and Saratoga Springs to reach the North Country at Lake George. Past this point, NY10 continued north on what is now US9, NY8, NY28, NY28N, and NY30 to Tupper Lake via Chestertown, Wevertown, North Creek, and Long Lake. At Tupper Lake, the route headed east on current NY3 to Wawbeek <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> more circuitous route to Saranac Lake by way of modern NY30, NY186, and NY86.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, {{the delegates}} at the {{convention}} continued to cast ballots until a victor could be determined. On the second ballot of the day, a Pennsylvania delegate named W. A. Grier cast a vote for James Garfield. However, the Garfield support remained with that one delegate's vote {{for most of the}} day. The delegates cast eighteen ballots <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> recess for dinner. After dinner, they came back and cast ten more ballots. Still, no candidate was close to the 379 votes needed to win. After twelve hours of balloting, Massachusetts delegate William Lovering moved to adjourn for the night. A few Grant delegates objected, but the motion to adjourn was passed by a vote of 446 to 308. After twenty-eight ballots, Grant had 307 votes, Blaine had 279 and Sherman had 91, {{and the rest of the}} votes were split between favorite son candidates like William Windom and George F. Edmunds.|$|E
5|$|Serb sources {{assert that}} the first mujahideen began {{arriving}} in Kosovo {{in the spring of}} 1998, mainly from Bosnia and Herzegovina. By that summer, about 240 mujahideen were present in Kosovo and northern Albania. Most of these were ethnic Albanians, but the group also included several dozen Arabs from the Middle East and North Africa. According to the diary of the ambushed KLA group's leader, Ali Rabiçi, the mujahideen involved in the July 18 ambush had initially gathered in Munich <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> ferry from Bari to the Albanian port city of Durrës. Once in Albania, the mujahideen were escorted to the frontier towns of Tropojë and Bajram Curri by their KLA handlers, where they rendezvoused with Rabiçi's men.|$|E

The candidate quoted former Secretary of State Colin Powell reflecting the need to be sure the intelligence was correct, to deploy the right amount of troops and to make sure that an exit strategy was planned. Following the debate, Thompson campaigned in New Hampshire <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> break for the rest of the month.|$|E

5|$|Until September 8, Typhoon Babe was {{forecast}} {{to continue}} northwestward into Taiwan and later China; however, another upper-level trough moved into northeastern China and further weakened the ridge. This in turn allowed {{a new area}} of low pressure to develop over the Korean Peninsula and cause Babe to curve northeastward. While moving northeastward, Babe gradually weakened and began to undergo a Fujiwhara-like interaction with the low near Korea as that system moved southwestward. Accelerating along a counter-clockwise arc, Babe moved through the Ryukyu Islands as a weakening typhoon on September 9 <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> steady westward course into China. As the system passed through the archipelago, a pressure of 907.3 mbar (hPa; 26.80 inHg) was measured on Okinoerabujima. Babe eventually made landfall near Shanghai with winds of 120 km/h (75 mph) before rapidly weakening over land. The system was last noted early on September 12 over Anhui Province.|$|E
5|$|Vera {{developed}} on September20 between Guam and Chuuk State, and initially tracked westward <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> more northerly course, reaching tropical storm strength the following day. By this point Vera had assumed a more westerly {{direction of movement}} and had begun to rapidly intensify, and reached its peak intensity on September23 with maximum sustained winds equivalent {{to that of a}} modern-day Category5 hurricane. With little change in strength, Vera curved and accelerated northward, resulting in a landfall on September26 near Shionomisaki on Honshu. Atmospheric wind patterns caused the typhoon to briefly emerge into the Sea of Japan before recurving eastward and moving ashore Honshu for a second time. Movement over land greatly weakened Vera, and after reentering the North Pacific Ocean later that day, Vera transitioned into an extratropical cyclone on September27; these remnants continued to persist for an additional two days.|$|E
5|$|William L. Mayo {{was born}} in Prestonsburg, Kentucky, in 1861, and was educated at Prestonsburg Seminary, Cedar Bluff Academy in Tazewell County, Virginia, and Central Normal College in Danville, Indiana; {{he had planned to}} attend Indiana University until {{financial}} difficulties prevented him from doing so. He worked as a teacher and principal at Cedar Bluff Academy <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> public school position in Denver, although he resigned upon arriving and learning that the school was integrated. Mayo then moved to Pecan Gap in Delta County, Texas, in 1886, where his aunt and uncle lived; he began teaching at the local public school, and by 1889 had become superintendent of nearby Cooper's public school system. During his tenure in Pecan Gap, Mayo earned a reputation as a disciplinarian, but also as a sympathetic instructor.|$|E

5|$|After the Olympics, Simpson trained {{throughout}} his winter break into 1957. In May, he rode {{in the national}} 25-mile championships; although he was the favourite, he lost to Sheil in the final. In a points race at an international event at Fallowfield a week later Simpson crashed badly, almost breaking his leg; he stopped working {{for a month and}} struggled to regain his form. At the national pursuit championships, he was beaten in the quarter-finals. After this defeat Simpson returned to road racing, winning the BLRC national hill climb championship in October <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> short break from racing. In spring 1958 he traveled to Sofia with Sheil for two weeks' racing. On his return he won the national individual pursuit championship at Herne Hill Velodrome. In July, Simpson won a silver medal for England in the individual pursuit at the British Empire and Commonwealth Games in Cardiff, losing to Sheil by one-hundredth of a second in the final. A medical exam taken with the Royal Air Force (RAF) revealed Simpson to be colour blind.|$|E
5|$|Bob Stoops {{returned}} for his eighth season as Oklahoma's head coach. During the off-season, {{he was once}} again mentioned {{as a candidate for}} positions outside of Oklahoma. While Stoops decided to stay in Norman, the rest of the Oklahoma coaching staff did see some changes. The biggest change came at the offensive coordinator position. Former offensive coordinator Chuck Long left Oklahoma to take the head coaching job at San Diego State University. Stoops chose somebody already on the staff to fill Long's spot. Kevin Wilson was named the new offensive coordinator after previously serving as the co-offensive coordinator along with Long as well as the offensive line coach. Rejoining the staff was former Sooner quarterback Josh Heupel, who led Oklahoma to the 2000 National Championship. Heupel had served two years as a graduate assistant <b>before</b> <b>taking</b> <b>a</b> position with Mike Stoops, Bob Stoops's brother, at the University of Arizona in 2005. Heupel took over Long's old position of quarterback coach. Leaving the staff was Darrell Wyatt, who spent four years as the wide receivers coach. He took a position with the NFL's Minnesota Vikings. This move launched another reshuffle of duties on Stoops's staff. Coach Kevin Sumlin took over Wyatt's duties with the wide receivers and was also named co-offensive coordinator with Wilson. Coach James Patton was hired on from Northwestern to take over Wilson's duties with the offensive line.|$|E
