5|$|Much of the inter-war period saw {{economic}} recession or stagnant growth, making fund-raising more challenging. Partially as a result, many memorial projects {{had to be}} cut back or altered {{due to lack of}} money. The final size of Douaumont had to <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> size by a third when fund-raising slowed. Proposals to turn the planned Imperial War Museum into a grand memorial for the war dead were shelved due to lack of funds.|$|E

The Icelandic Pension Funds Association has announced that benefits will in all likelihood have to <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> 2009. Iceland's GDP is expected by economists to shrink {{by as much as}} 10% {{as a result of the}} crisis, putting Iceland by some measures in an economic depression. Inflation may climb as high as 75% by the end of the year.|$|E
5|$|Food was {{in short}} supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, with rations {{inadequate}} to meet nutritional needs.

A popular variation in north India is the Gajar Ka Halwa carrot dessert, which has carrots grated and cooked in milk until the whole mixture is solid, after which nuts and butter are added. Carrot salads are usually made with grated carrots with a seasoning of mustard seeds and green chillies popped in hot oil. Carrots can also <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> thin strips and added to rice, can form part of a dish of mixed roast vegetables or can be blended with tamarind to make chutney.|$|E
5|$|While {{the last}} three Fire Emblem titles had used a similar setting, with Shadow Dragon and the Blade of Light and Mystery of the Emblem both being set on the {{continent}} of Archanea, Kaga wanted to create something new for his next title. This was for two reasons: he wanted {{to move beyond the}} confines of Archanea, and also wanted to try his hand at a large-scale historical drama. Similar to other Fire Emblem titles, the setting drew inspiration from Medieval Europe. The story's inspiration changed, drawing from Norse and Celtic mythology as opposed to the elements from Classical mythology used by earlier titles. Similar to Mystery of the Emblem, the story was split into two halves, with the first half acting as an introduction for Seliph's quest. The story's main theme was how the stupidity of humans could forge history. The focus shifted away from the characters to the overall world of Jugdral, intended to show the scale of the conflict and make it seem like history in the making. While the backstory of Jugdral featured a clearly defined battle between good and evil, the main story's distinction between good and evil was blurred, exemplified by the descendants of the Twelve Crusaders being on opposing sides rather than united. A stated example was Alvis, whose conquests were driven by a wish to end discrimination against Loptyr descendants. Due to this, Kaga did not create a storyline focused on poetic justice and morality, instead aiming for a more realistic scenario. This realism also prompted the inclusion of elements such as patricide and incest, which had occurred in history but were not typically included in gaming narratives at the time. The story originally had three acts rather than two. The missing act would have covered the period {{between the first and second}} act, which put a more overt focus on the themes of patricide and incest. Due to time constraints, this third act needed to <b>be</b> <b>cut.</b> <b>In</b> a later interview, Kaga felt that the focus on narrative weakened the gameplay.|$|E

Rated at about 300hp (224kW) at speeds of from 10 to 30 miles per hour (16 to 48km/h). It would automatically cut out from between 20 and 35mph (32 to 56km/h), depending on the model and design. Tractive effort of 10-12,000lbf (44 to 53kN) was common, although ratings of up to around 15,000lbf (66kN) were possible.|$|E

25|$|In April 1971, {{a project}} to install {{high-level}} platforms at stations along the Harlem Line started. This was necessary as the new Metropolitan cars {{did not have any}} stairs to reach the low-level platforms. By having high-level platforms, dwell times could <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half. Most of the new platforms were built as island platforms. These cars started entering into service in September 1971. At the same, time reverse signaling was installed to allow trains to use either track in either direction, enabling both tracks to be used in one direction during the peak of the rush hour.|$|E
25|$|As in coppicing, the {{tradition}} of pollarding is to encourage the tree to produce new growth {{on a regular basis}} to maintain a supply of new wood for various purposes, particularly for fuel. In some areas, dried leafy branches are stored as winter fodder for stock. Depending upon the use of the cut material, the length of time between cutting will vary from one year for tree hay or withies, to five years or more for larger timber. Sometimes, only some of the regrown stems may <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> a season – this is thought to reduce the chances of death of the tree when recutting long-neglected pollards.|$|E
25|$|While numerically {{the strongest}} {{air force in}} the world, the VVS was an {{imbalanced}} force {{in comparison to the}} British, Americans and Germans at the time of Barbarossa. It relied on too few established designers and an over-centralised system which produced aircraft that fell behind the standards of most powers. The VVS was also profoundly influenced by Giulio Douhet, and the theory of air power that was focused on the offensive, and bombing the enemy heartland. It was overloaded with inadequately designed bombers, which were expected to survive in combat. In 1938 production of light and strike aircraft as well as fighters was to <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> two to allow for more bomber aircraft to be produced.|$|E

25|$|Strategies {{to provide}} {{education}} cost effectively include deworming children, which costs about 50 cents per child {{per year and}} reduces non-attendance from anemia, illness and malnutrition, while being only a twenty-fifth as expensive as increasing school attendance by constructing schools. Schoolgirl absenteeism could <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half by simply providing free sanitary towels. Fortification with micronutrients was ranked the most cost effective aid strategy by the Copenhagen Consensus. For example, iodised salt costs 2 to 3 cents per person a year while even moderate iodine deficiency in pregnancy shaves off 10 to 15 IQ points. Paying for school meals is argued to be an efficient strategy in increasing school enrollment, reducing absenteeism and increasing student attention.|$|E
25|$|In June 2006 Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) {{management}} {{announced that}} they have elected not to modify the Berkeley Hills Tunnel, which actually penetrates the Hayward Fault, arguing {{that it would be}} cheaper (and less disruptive to current operations) to rebore a misaligned portion after the fact than to protect riders (either by extensive modifications of the tunnel or by replacing it with a higher bore) against the small likelihood that a train (or two) would crash into or <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> two by a major slippage of the fault. Modified train scheduling to prevent multiple train exposure at faults has been determined by BART engineers to be impractical due to variations in train passage, but automated event-related realtime train operational response is considered practical (see below).|$|E

25|$|Some {{researchers}} use chicken mash for feed. A {{plastic pipe}} can <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half lengthwise {{to make two}} troughs {{which can be used}} as feeders for mash. Mix laying mash (used for egg-producing hens) into the feed to provide calcium for the snails' shells. Commercial chicken feeding mash is around 16% to 17% protein, from fish meal and meat meal, making it good for growing snails. Supplying mash to hatchlings might reduce cannibalism. Two feeds that snails like and that promote good growth are: (A) broiler finisher mash consisting of 7% broiler concentrate, 58% corn, 16% soya, 18% sorghum, 7% limestone flour (40% Ca); and (B) chicken feed (pellets) for layers consisting of 5% layer concentrate, 10%, corn, 15% soya, 20% sorghum, 44% barley, 6% limestone flour (40% Ca).|$|E
25|$|Even {{with modern}} techniques, the cutting and {{polishing}} of a diamond crystal always {{results in a}} dramatic loss of weight; rarely is it less than 50%. The round brilliant cut is preferred when the crystal is an octahedron, as often two stones may be cut from one such crystal. Oddly-shaped crystals such as macles {{are more likely to}} <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> a fancy cut (that is, a cut other than the round brilliant), which the particular crystal shape lends itself to. The prevalence and choice of a particular fancy cut is also influenced by fashion; generally speaking, these cuts are not held to the same strict standards as Tolkowsky-derived round brilliants. Most fancy cuts can be grouped into four categories: modified brilliants, step cuts, mixed cuts, and rose cuts.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the Battle of Leyte in the Philippines, the Allies {{were left}} with a two-month lull in their {{offensive}} operations before the planned invasion of Okinawa. Iwo Jima was strategically important: it provided an air base for Japanese fighter planes to intercept long-range B-29 Superfortress bombers, and it provided a haven for Japanese naval units in dire need of any support available. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage air attacks on the Mariana Islands from November 1944 through January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate these problems and provide a staging area for Operation Downfall – the eventual invasion of the Japanese Home Islands. The distance of B-29 raids could (hypothetically) <b>be</b> <b>cut</b> <b>in</b> half, and a base would be available for P-51 Mustang fighters to escort and protect the bombers.|$|E
