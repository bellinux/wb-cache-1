5|$|General Washington {{essentially}} assumed three roles {{during the}} war. First, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775–77 {{and again in}} 1781. He lost many of his battles, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> surrendered his army during the war, and he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end. He plotted the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress.|$|E
5|$|Halcombe's career {{continued}} {{after that}} time without further throwing controversies, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> again threatened for national selection. He was overlooked for selection in the 193031 season, not playing a single first-class match. In the following season, {{he was only}} selected for one match, against the touring South Africans, taking 3/114 as the tourists won by an innings and 242 runs. He scored five not out and five respectively.|$|E

His two closest friends died from drug abuse at the ages of 19 and 30. Growing up in The Bronx, he got into occasional fights and was considered something of a troublemaker at school.|$|E

5|$|Powell, his wife, and Brown {{were killed}} in a car crash when {{traveling}} overnight from Philadelphia to Chicago. Powell was beginning to achieve recognition {{at the time of his}} death, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> had the chance to record as a leader. He had a playful piano style, and was fond of using musical quotations. His relatively heavy touch and use of left-hand fourths influenced fellow pianist McCoy Tyner.|$|E

We were shooting a Junkanoo Festival with noisy drums and hundreds of extras. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> faltered in his concentration and he put me completely at ease. It was all so natural. He's an extraordinary actor– and just a nice human being.|$|E

5000|$|... “He {{went into}} {{remission}} after the operation, <b>but</b> <b>he’s</b> <b>never</b> been that strong since,” band bassist Steve Priest said. “This has taken everyone by surprise.” Bassist Steve Priest commented: [...] "He {{was the best}} drummer England ever produced {{and it is a}} sad loss to the music world. It was a little bit sudden, to be honest. He {{was on the verge of}} leukaemia five years ago but had a bone marrow transplant from his brother, which stopped him getting it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>never</b> the same." ...|$|R

5|$|Burnham {{eventually}} {{went back}} to California to attend high school, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> graduated.

5|$|Edward {{left for}} the Eighth Crusade, led by Louis of France, in 1270, but Henry became {{increasingly}} ill; concerns about a fresh rebellion grew {{and the next year}} the King wrote to his son asking him to return to England, but Edward did not turn back. Henry recovered slightly and announced his renewed intention to join the crusades himself, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> regained his full health and on the evening of 16 November 1272, Henry died in Westminster, probably with Eleanor in attendance. He was succeeded by Edward, who slowly made his way back to England via Gascony, finally arriving in August 1274.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Lucky Luciano {{was photographed}} {{in front of}} the Hotel Sole in the centre of old Palermo – often the {{residence}} of Don Calò Vizzini – talking with Don Calò’s bodyguards.

Vizzini’s network reached the United States where he knew the future family boss Angelo Annaloro of Philadelphia, known as Angelo Bruno, who was born in Villalba.|$|E

She left for Nice immediately but when she arrived that morning, Goldman found that he had shot himself and was in a nearly comatose paralysis. He died later that evening.|$|E
60|$|Gale's happiness, {{as far as}} it {{concerned}} the toil and strife, was perhaps a grim and stoical one. But love abided with him, and it had engendered and fostered other undeveloped traits--romance and a feeling for beauty, and a keen observation of nature. <b>He</b> felt pain, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>never</b> miserable. <b>He</b> felt the solitude, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was <b>never</b> lonely.|$|R

5|$|Inquiries {{were made}} through {{official}} channels {{about the prospect of}} Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> enrolled. According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it, possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam. Murphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment.|$|E
5|$|Lody's {{controllers}} realised {{that his}} mission {{was not going}} according to plan and attempted {{to get in touch}} with him to provide assistance. A letter dated 8 September was sent to Charles A. Inglis c/o Thomas Cook, Edinburgh, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> collected it, and may never have been aware of it. Another German agent, Paul Daelen, was ordered to go to Britain and provide Lody with a new cover address. Daelen reached England too late. Lody had already travelled to Ireland without giving his controllers a means of contacting him.|$|E
5|$|Remains of Megalomys audreyae {{were found}} by John Walter Gregory among cave breccia on Barbuda around 1900. The exact {{locality}} is unknown. In his 1901 description of Oryzomys luciae, Charles Immanuel Forsyth Major mentioned the Barbuda animal as {{another member of}} the Megalomys group, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>never</b> published a description of the latter. Édouard Louis Trouessart gave the name Oryzomys (Megalomys) majori to it in his Catalogus Mammalium, but he did not describe it and therefore the name is a nomen nudum. In 1926, Arthur Hopwood finally described it and named it Megalomys audreyae after Gregory's wife Audrey, following Major's intention.|$|E
