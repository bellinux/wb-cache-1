40|$|Purpose. Lack of {{kinematics}} {{models and}} imperfection {{of the known}} dynamics models of the roller bearings of railway rolling stock axle-boxes do not allow designing the optimal structure of bearing cages, providing the required service life and reliability of bearing units of wheel sets for cars and locomotives. The studies of kinematics and dynamics of roller bearings of axle boxes for cars and locomotives and modeling of their parts interaction to create the analytical method of bearing cages calculation are necessary. Methodology. This purpose has been achieved due to the modeling of kinematics of the ideal (without gaps) and real (taking account the gaps, manufacturing and installation errors) bearings, substantiation of the transfer mechanism of motion from the rollers to <b>bearing</b> <b>cage,</b> modeling the dynamics of rolling, research of interaction forces of the rollers with <b>bearing</b> <b>cage.</b> Findings. It is established that the kinematics of ideal bearing {{is determined by the}} contact deformations of the rollers and rings, when the kinematics of real bearing depends mainly on the side gaps in the windows of the <b>bearing</b> <b>cage.</b> On the basis of studies of the real bearing kinematics the dynamics models of the rollers and <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> interaction were constructed. The conducted studies of kinematics and dynamics of rolling bearings have changed our view of them as of the planetary mechanism, explained the reason of <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> loading, and confirmed the possibility of destruction during operation.

40|$|A battery-less {{wireless}} {{sensing technology}} {{to monitor the}} cage temperature in bearings was developed. Non-contact measurements are necessary because the <b>bearing</b> <b>cage</b> performs a sliding motion with respect to inner and outer races, and its rotation excludes direct wiring {{and the use of}} slip rings. Four wireless sensing circuit prototypes were implemented. Three circuits are based on a Colpitts oscillator, a Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) and a Meissner oscillator, respectively, and a fourth sensor is based on Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) principles. Radio-frequency (RF) signals are used to supply the energy to the sensor electronics, so no direct contacts to the sensor circuits are required. Experimental results on a bearing while it is operating are presented.

The results of FEA calculation and theoretical analysis show {{that one of the}} main factors affecting flexures ’ machining is the weak torsional stiffness of the <b>bearing</b> <b>cage,</b> thus excessive deflections due to machining stress, heat generation and spark-induced vibrations may occur. To minimize flexure deflection during the machining process, a specially designed fixture is utilized. Other technical measures, including residual stress relief before and after Wire EDM cutting, reasonable cutting sequence planning, multiple-cutting (i. e., rough cut followed by several trim cuts) etc., are also adopted for cutting. Dimensional accuracy of ± 5 µm was obtained over the 150 µm thickness for the bearing flexures, a variation of less than 3 µm was achieved for the flexures of opposing sides, and surface roughness of better than Ra 0. 3 µm was obtained for the flexures of the entire <b>bearing</b> <b>cage.</b> These results show the validity of measures aforementioned...|$|E

40|$|Purpose. About one of {{the causes}} of slip rolling is known from {{the second half of the}} 19 th century, it was {{believed}} that the slip resistance appears at the place of contact due to different speeds on the arc of contact. Only in the mid- 20 th century it was proved that this resistance is negligible in rolling resistance. However (for some unknown reason) it is ignored the fact that in practice in rolling bearings may rotate both the inner ring with a stationary outer one, and vice versa almost in equal relations. It is not taken into account the fact that the ball or roller in the rolling bearings runs the different distance along the roller path of the outer and inner <b>bearing</b> <b>cages</b> in one revolution. This fact is not taken into account in determining the calculated values for the friction coefficient of a rolling bearing reduced to the shaft. Therefore, the aim of this work is to determine the influence of path length on the track riding the outer and inner race of the bearing on the determination of the calculated value of the coefficient of friction of rolling bearings is given to the shaft. Methodology. The solution technique is based on the theory of plane motion of a rigid body, the theory of Hertzian contact deformation and the analytical dependencies for determination of coefficient of rolling friction. Findings. The obtained dependences on determination of rolling resistance of the balls or rollers along the bearing tracks of inner and outer <b>bearing</b> <b>cages</b> as well as path difference metering of the rolling on them allows to analytically obtain the rolling resistance and slipping for any size of bearings and different devices of bearing units.

30|$|Polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK) and {{polyimide}} (PI) are {{two kinds}} of engineering polymer materials widely used as roller <b>bearing</b> <b>cages</b> and rings under extreme environment because of their noise reduction and corrosion resistance properties. The Si 3 N 4 ceramic is the most common ball bearing material. Many current engineering applications of ball bearings require aqueous lubrication. Therefore, this study presents the aqueous lubrication of tribopairs formed by PEEK and PI material sliding against Si 3 N 4 ceramic. Experimental results show that two tribopairs exhibited the similar tribological properties under the dry condition. Water as a lubricant for the PI–Si 3 N 4 tribopair pairs effectively reduces both friction coefficients by 35.5 % and wear rates by 32 %. The water absorption of PI induces better tribological properties by changing the tribopair surface properties. In addition, the dimples appearing on the PI tribopair surface under water generate additional hydrodynamic lubrication and further improve the friction properties of surface. The PEEK–Si 3 N 4 tribopair shows similar friction coefficients under two kinds of environments. The wear rates under water are approximately more than two times of that under dry sliding. However, water inhibits the appearance of the crush phenomenon and enhances the carrying capacity of the tribopair. Energy dispersive spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction spectra demonstrate no chemical corrosion. The 3 D profiler and SEM morphologies illustrate that the transfer film would be formed from the surface of PEEK under water but hindered under dry friction. Overall, the PI–Si 3 N 4 tribopair exhibits better properties than PEEK under water and is promising for future applications in the bearing industry.|$|R
