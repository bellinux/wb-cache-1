40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{the development of}} a micro total analysis system for the detection of ochratoxin A (OTA) in wine and beer. The OTA detection strategy is based on an indirect competitive ELISA detection by chemiluminescence with the integration of microfluidics with microfabricated amorphous silicon photodiodes fabricated on glass substrates [1]. The full lab-on-chip (LoC) assay is implemented on a prototype device for fully-automatic measurement and monitoring of photodiode signals and control of fluid handling. The device is composed of three peripheral control and measurement modules: a peristaltic pump, a fluid dispenser for fluid handling, and a multi-sensor data acquisition with custom transimpedance amplifier. A microcontroller interfaces the individual modules with a computer via USB communication. The analysis is run automatically and the results displayed through a PC controlled user interface.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a sensorial aroma extract dilution analysis (AEDA) {{approach to the}} analysis of beer aromas derived from hops. To obtain an extract with an odor representative of the original product, the XAD extraction procedure was applied and the experimental conditions were optimized. The aromagrams of three beers were compared: one brewed without hops, one brewed with Saaz hop pellets, and one brewed with Challenger hop pellets. One spicy/hoppy compound, unmodified from hop to beer, proved responsible for the most intense odor in both hopped <b>beer</b> <b>extracts.</b> Another flavoring compound in hops, linalool, also survives through the process to the final beer. Other compounds such as gamma -nonalactone and humuladienone, although not found in our extracts of hop, significantly modify beer aromagrams after hopping. Sulfur compounds characteristic of Challenger hops proved to be at least partially responsible for the unpleasant flavor found in the corresponding beer...|$|R
40|$|International audienceA new {{analytical}} method (liquid chromatography-antioxidant, LC-AOx) was used that {{is intended to}} separate beer polyphenols and to determine the potential antioxidant activity of these constituents after {{they were allowed to}} react online with a. buffered solution of the radical cation 2, 2 '-azinobis(3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid) (ABTS(center dot+)). Using the LC-AOx method, it was possible to demonstrate that the extent of the antioxidant activity was very much dependent on the phenolic compound considered. The method was also applied to the analysis of <b>beer</b> <b>extracts</b> and allowed the evaluation of their antioxidant activity at different steps of beer processing: brewing, boiling, and fermentation. This study showed that the total antioxidant activity remained unchanged throughout beer processing, as opposed to the polyphenolic content, which showed a 3 -fold increase. Hopping and fermentation steps were the main causes of this increase. However, the increase measured after fermentation was attributed to a better extraction of polyphenols due to the presence of ethanol, rather than to a real increase in their content. Moreover, this method allowed the detection of three unknown antioxidant compounds, which accounted for 64 +/- 4 % of the total antioxidant activity of beer and were individually more efficient than caffeic acid and epicatechin...|$|R
40|$|Combinatorial {{chemistry}} {{was used}} to extend the knowledge of beer thiols by synthesizing 13 mercapto primary alcohols and 6 other compounds (mercapto ketones and corresponding alcohols). Their respective mass spectra, retention indices on two columns, odor descriptors, and best estimated-gas chromatography-lowest amounts detected sniffing (BE-GC-LoADS) are reported. The descriptor "cheese", commonly associated with mercapto aldehydes and thioesters, was rarely used for mercapto alcohols or mercapto ketones. Polyfunctional thiols containing at least six carbon atoms usually gave a delicate odor of rhubarb/carrot, whereas most of the mercapto primary alcohols of intermediate size were described as onion-like, plastic-like, or pungent. Sensorial analysis of beers spiked with copper(II) ions allowed confirmation of the participation of thiols in the overall odor of fresh beer. The finding of 4 -mercapto- 4 -methyl- 2 -pentanone and 3 -mercaptohexanol in an XAD- 2 Amberlite resin <b>beer</b> <b>extract</b> indicates a requirement for a more efficient thiol extraction procedure allowing identification of relevant polyfunctional thiols for brewing scientists...|$|E

New methodologies are needed, however, to understand {{what happens to them}} in the bottled beer. For {{the first time in the}} brewing Held, thiolysis was hyphenated to RP-HPLC-ESI(-) -MS/MS to investigate these flavanoids. Thirty minutes at 40 degrees C followed by 10 h at room temperature emerged as the best conditions for complete depolymerisation. NP-HPLC-ESI(-) -MS/MS was used to quantify and isolate fractions from monomers to trimers in a Sephadex LH 20 acetone/water (70 / 30, v/v) <b>beer</b> <b>extract.</b> Unsurprisingly, a lower dimer/monomer ratio was evidenced in PVPP-treated beers than in silica gel-filtered beers. Most beer dimers are procyanidins B 3 (two catechin units) whilst most trimers are prodelphinidins (catechin in terminal units and gallocatechins or catechins in extension units). Gallocatechin appeared to come mainly from malt. Despite the absence of chromatographic peaks corresponding to oligomers above trimers, an apparent degree of polymerisation close to six was calculated in the total LH 20 extract. Still higher mean degrees of polymerisation (mDPs) were calculated for malt and hop, indicating selective extraction or depolymerisation from raw materials to beer.

Color parameters were significantly (p < 0. 05) affected by the addition of antioxidants so that samples that contained antioxidants were more effective in maintaining color. The improving effects were dose-dependent with highest values with the dose of 50 mg/kg during ripening and depend on the extract during vacuum packaging. Addition of antioxidants decreased (p < 0. 05) the oxidation, showing thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARS) values below 0. 4 mg MDA/kg. Natural antioxidants matched or even improved the results obtained for butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT). Regarding texture profile analysis (TPA) analysis, hardness values significantly (p < 0. 001) decreased with the addition of antioxidants, obtaining the lower results with the dose of 200 mg/kg both during ripening and vacuum packaging. Antioxidants reduced the counts of total viable counts (TVC), lactic acid bacteria (LAB), mold and yeast. Free fatty acid content during ripening and under vacuum conditions showed a gradual and significant (p < 0. 05) release as a result of lipolysis.

40|$|Fining {{agents are}} used in the {{clarification}} of beers; they help to reduce the time required to sediment suspended yeast cells and ensure the clarity and colloidal stability of beer. Following an adventitious observation during dry-hopping experiments, we identified a fining activity associated with Saaz hops. Extracts of hop cones were subsequently shown to have the capacity to flocculate yeast and result in their sedimentation. This activity has since been identified in extracts of many different hop varieties and, significantly in spent hops, the co-product resulting from commercial extraction of hops with either CO 2 or ethanol. Here we illustrate the activity of the novel finings extracted from spent hops following CO 2 extraction of Galena hops. The sediments formed on fining were compact, relative to those obtained when commercial isinglass was used to fine the same <b>beers.</b> The hop <b>extracts</b> were also effective in reducing 90 ° haze in beers under conditions designed to mimic both cask ale (12 [*]°C) and lager (4 [*]°C) type applications.

5000|$|The {{first step}} in wort {{production}} is to make malt from dried, sprouted barley. The malt is then run through a roller mill and cracked. This cracked grain is then mashed, that is, mixed with hot water and steeped, a slow heating process that enables enzymes to convert the starch in the malt into sugars. At set intervals, most notably when the mixture has reached temperatures of 45, 62 and 73 °C (113, 144 and 163 °F), the heating is briefly halted. The temperature of the mixture is usually increased to 78 °C (172 °F) for mashout. Lautering is the next step, which means the sugar-extracted grist or solids remaining in the mash are separated from the liquid wort. In homebrewing, the malt-making and mashing steps can be skipped by adding malt extract to water. The mixture is then boiled to sanitize the wort and, {{in the case of}} most <b>beer</b> production, to <b>extract</b> the bittering, flavour and aroma from hops. In beer making, the wort is known as [...] "sweet wort" [...] until the hops have been added, after which it is called [...] "hopped or bitter wort". The addition of hops is generally done in three parts at set times. The bittering hops, added first, are boiled in the wort for approximately one hour to one and a half hours. This long boil extracts resins, which provides the bittering. Then, the flavouring hops are added, typically 15 minutes {{from the end of the}} boil. The finishing hops are added last, toward the end of or after the boil. This extracts the oils, which provide flavour and aroma but evaporate quickly. In general, hops provide the most flavouring when boiled for approximately 15 minutes, and the most aroma when not boiled at all.|$|R

Soil fauna were collected utilizing pitfall traps made of plastic cups containing three different bait types (beef <b>extract,</b> <b>beer</b> and banana, and soap water) placed at three different elevations (Flic en Flac, 5 m; Rose-Hill, 221 m; and Mare aux Vacoas, 569 m). Traps were placed among primary roadside tree species: Casuarina equisetifolia (Flic en Flac,), Dictyosperma album (Rose-Hill) and Pinus sylvestris (Mare aux Vacoas). A total of 18, 114 individuals of soil fauna were sampled of which 10, 142 individuals were sampled at Flic en Flac; 5293 individuals at Rose-Hill; and 2697 individuals at Mare aux Vacoas. The most abundant soil fauna among the three study sites was Carpophilus cheesmani (relative frequency= 25. 31 %; relative abundance= 46. 54 %). The heaviest soil fauna recorded was Achatina immaculata (mean biomass= 1. 2 g). The Shannon Wiener Diversity varied significantly (p< 0. 05) between elevations (5 m= 1. 84, 221 m = 1. 21, 569 m= 2. 54) while evenness was highest at 569 m (0. 92) followed by 5 m (0. 70) and lowest at 221 m (0. 42). The study sites with the highest soil fauna similarity were Mare aux Vacoas and Rose-Hill (0. 71). Significant difference in soil fauna abundance and biomass was observed between elevations (< 0. 05), between months (< 0. 05) and between bait trap types (p< 0. 05). Significant correlations (p< 0. 05) between soil physiochemical parameters were recorded as well as their effect on soil fauna abundance.

(Piquiarana) em comparação com Eucalyptus sp., principal substrato utilizado na fungicultura do Sul e Sudeste do Brasil e Quercus acutissima Carr., muito utilizado na Ásia. As serragens foram suplementadas com 20 % (w/w) de farelo de arroz. Os substratos a base de serragem de B. quinata e S. amara promoveram maiores crescimentos miceliais (p< 0, 05). Em uma segunda etapa, avaliou-se o crescimento micelial em serragem de S. amara suplementada com sete diferentes fontes de nitrogênio (20 % w/w) : farelo de arroz, extrato de soja, levedura de cerveja, farinha da casca de maracujá, fibra de soja, fibra de trigo e gérmen de trigo. Como controle utilizou-se, serragem pura. Todas as suplementações favoreceram em diferentes níveis o crescimento micelial de L. strigosus. Para a produção de “semente-inóculo” foram testados sacos e frascos de polipropileno utilizando serragens de S. amara, H. petraeum e A. lecointei suplementadas com farelo de arroz, após 25 dias de inoculação os substratos estavam totalmente colonizados por L. strigosus em todas as embalagens testadas, para a escolha da embalagem foram considerados aspectos como custos das embalagens; tempo de colonização; viabilidade de transporte e praticidade de inoculação do micélio no substrato. Mediante estes resultados, a “semente-inóculo” de L. strigosus foi elaborada com sucesso, utilizando-se serragem de S. amara suplementado com 20 % (w/w) de farelo de arroz, a 35 ºC por 25 dias, no escuro, em três embalagens com características diferentes. The Amazonas State presents favorable scenery for {{the development}} of the fungiculture, because gathers the native diversity of species of edible mushrooms and abundantly substrates lignocellulosics. However, the protocols of cultivation are usually described for species of temperate climate habitat, being necessary the development of protocols for species of tropical climate. The specie Lentinus strigosus (Schwein.) Fr. (=Panus rudis Fr.) has a wide world distribution presenting several ecotypes. The edibility of this specie has been reported in ethnomycology studies of indigenous groups in the Amazon. However, your potential production in commercial scale has still been a little explored. In this study, reported the optimum conditions in vitro of mycelial growth of L. strigosus. The isolated presented characteristics of thermophile filamentous mushroom, with growth in temperatures from 25 to 45 °C, being the optimum growth temperature, 35 °C. This temperature is an important advantage {{for the development}} of the fungiculture in the tropics, since it is a common temperature for the region. In relation to the substrates for spawn preparation, in a first phase, the mycelial growth of L. strigosus was evaluated in based on sawdust formulations of 11 forestry regional species: Hymenolobium petraeum Ducke (Angelim pedra), Hura crepitans L. (Assacu), Bertholletia excelsa H. B. K. (Castanheira), Cedrela odorata L. (Cedro), Bombacopsis quinata (Jacq.) Dugand. (Cedro doce), Hymenaea courbaril L. (Jatobá), Ocotea cymbarum Kunth (Louro canela), Simarouba amara Aubl. (Marupá), Astronium lecointei Ducke (Muiracatiara), Aniba rosaeodora Ducke (Pau rosa) and Caryocar sp. (Piquiarana) and Eucalyptus sp. in comparison, main substratum used in the fungiculture of the South and Southeast of Brazil and Quercus acutissima Carr., very used in Asia. The sawdusts were supplemented with 20 % (w/w) of rice bran. The substrates formulated with sawdust of B. quinata and S. amara they promoted higher mycelial growth (p< 0. 05). In the second phase, was evaluated the mycelial growth in sawdust of S. amara supplemented with seven different nitrogen sources (20 % w/w) : rice bran, soy <b>extract,</b> <b>beer</b> yeast, passion fruit shell flour, soy fiber, wheat fiber and wheat germ. As control was utilized pure sawdust. All the supplements favored in different levels the mycelial growth of L. strigosus. Bags and flasks of polypropylene were tested for spawn production and utilizing sawdust of S. amara, H. petraeum and A. lecointei supplemented with rice bran, after 25 days of inoculation the substrates were totally colonized by L. strigosus in all the packings tested. For choice of the packing other criteria should be considered aspects as costs of the packings; time of colonization; transport viability and feasibility of mycelial inoculation on the substratum. By these results, the spawn of L. strigosus was elaborated with success, being used sawdust of S. amara supplemented with 20 % (w/w) of rice bran, at 35 °C during 25 days, in the dark, in three packings with different characteristics...|$|R
