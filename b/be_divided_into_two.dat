5|$|The {{development}} of Nazi propaganda in occupied Poland can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> main phases. Initial efforts were directed towards creating a negative image of pre-war Poland, and later efforts {{were aimed at}} fostering anti-Soviet, antisemitic, and pro-German attitudes.|$|E
5|$|The body is {{the main}} part of the cloth, and is filled with a wide variety of patterns. The body can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> {{alternating}} patterns and colours called pagi-sore ('dawn-dusk'). Brighter pattern are shown during the day, while darker pattern are shown in the evening. The alternating colours give the impression of two batik sets.|$|E
5|$|The moons of Neptune can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> groups: {{regular and}} irregular. The first group {{includes}} the seven inner moons, which follow circular prograde orbits {{lying in the}} equatorial plane of Neptune. The second group consists of all seven other moons including Triton. They generally follow inclined eccentric and often retrograde orbits far from Neptune; the only exception is Triton, which orbits close to the planet following a circular orbit, though retrograde and inclined.|$|E
50|$|The tournament <b>is</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> stages; a group {{stage and}} a {{classification}} stage. In the group stage, the eight teams <b>are</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> {{groups of four}} teams, which then play a single-game round robin format.|$|R
50|$|Historically, Tettenhall parish <b>was</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> manors, Tettenhall Regis ("Tettenhall of the king") and Tettenhall Clericorum ("Tettenhall of the clergy"). Likewise, {{the smaller}} prebend of Tettenhall <b>was</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> constablewicks called Tettenhall Regis and Tettenhall Clericorum.|$|R
50|$|In the 2007 season, Division 1 <b>was</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> groups (22 clubs). In the 2008 season, Division 2 also <b>was</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> groups.

5|$|There {{is another}} {{concrete}} definition of evenness: if {{the objects in}} a set can be placed into two groups of equal size, then the number of objects is even. This definition {{is equivalent to the}} first one. Again, zero is even because the empty set can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> groups of zero items each.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of aircraft {{played a role}} in transporting the task force to France, which had to <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> large groups and a small glider group for the British. On D-Day the first large group would be transported to France by 394 aircraft and eighty gliders. A second group of 325 aircraft and 270 gliders would arrive in the afternoon. The smaller British group consisting of the 2nd Parachute Brigade's glider forces would arrive shortly after the first group in the morning. In total 9,099 troops, 221 vehicles and 213 artillery guns would be delivered to France during Operation Rugby.|$|E
5|$|According to some authors, {{who use the}} {{original}} description by Treitz, the muscle may <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> sections: a ligamentous portion attaching the right crus of diaphragm to the connective tissue surrounding the coeliac artery and superior mesenteric artery; and a lower muscular portion from the connective tissue attaching to the duodenum. The superior portion is also described as the Hilfsmuskel. These two parts are now considered anatomically distinct, with the suspensory muscle referring solely to the lower structure attaching at the duodenum.|$|E

5|$|Adult Pteranodon {{specimens}} {{from the}} two major species can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> distinct size classes. The smaller class of specimens have small, rounded head crests and very wide pelvic canals, even wider {{than those of the}} much larger size class. The size of the pelvic canal probably allowed the laying of eggs, indicating that these smaller adults are females. The larger size class, representing male individuals, have narrow hips and very large crests, which were probably for display.|$|E
5|$|Comets can loosely <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> categories: short-period and long-periodâ€”the latter being {{thought to}} {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, {{are thought to have}} originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are thought to have originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E
5|$|Edmontosaurus was {{a wide-ranging}} genus in both time and space. The rock units {{from which it}} is known can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> groups by age: the older Horseshoe Canyon and St. Mary River formations, and the younger Frenchman, Hell Creek, and Lance formations. The time span covered by the Horseshoe Canyon Formation and {{equivalents}} {{is also known as}} Edmontonian, and the time span covered by the younger units is also known as Lancian. The Edmontonian and Lancian time intervals had distinct dinosaur faunas.|$|E

5|$|His campaigns conquered much French territory, but by 1374, all {{the gains}} had been lost. Edward's reign was also {{marked by the}} further {{development}} of Parliament, which came to <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> Houses. In 1377, Edward III died, leaving the Crown to his 10-year-old grandson Richard II. Like many of his predecessors, Richard II conflicted with the nobles by attempting to concentrate power in his own hands. In 1399, while he was campaigning in Ireland, his cousin Henry Bolingbroke seized power. Richard was deposed, imprisoned, and eventually murdered, probably by starvation, and Henry became king as Henry IV.|$|E
5|$|In humans, bites {{from this}} species can produce severe local and {{systemic}} symptoms. Based {{on the degree}} and type of local effect, bites can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> symptomatic categories: those {{with little or no}} surface extravasation, and those with hemorrhages evident as ecchymosis, bleeding and swelling. In both cases there is severe pain and tenderness, but in the latter there is widespread superficial or deep necrosis and compartment syndrome. Serious bites cause limbs to become immovably flexed as a result of significant hemorrhage or coagulation in the affected muscles. Residual induration, however, is rare and usually these areas completely resolve.|$|E
5|$|Insects can <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> groups {{historically}} {{treated as}} subclasses: wingless insects, known as Apterygota, and winged insects, known as Pterygota. The Apterygota consist of the primitively wingless {{order of the}} silverfish (Zygentoma). Archaeognatha make up the Monocondylia based on the shape of their mandibles, while Zygentoma and Pterygota are grouped together as Dicondylia. The Zygentoma themselves possibly are not monophyletic, with the family Lepidotrichidae being a sister group to the Dicondylia (Pterygota and the remaining Zygentoma).|$|E

5|$|Meher Baba's teachings can roughly <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> main categories: his metaphysics on {{the nature}} of the soul and the Universe, and {{practical}} advice for the spiritual aspirant. The two are interrelated. His metaphysics is mostly found in his principal book on the subject, God Speaks. It contains detailed statements on his cosmology and the purpose of life as well as the progression of the soul, while his elucidations on the practical spiritual life are mostly contained in Discourses, although it also covers many metaphysical areas mirroring or amplifying God Speaks.|$|E
5|$|The broad {{heading of}} {{illegality}} may <b>be</b> <b>divided</b> <b>into</b> <b>two</b> sub-headings. In the first case, the High Court inquires into whether the public authority was empowered {{to take a}} particular course of action or make a decision, and, in the other, whether it exercised its discretion wrongly {{even though it was}} empowered to act. Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly, it may invalidate the act or decision.|$|E

Where the Court finds that the public authority had exceeded its jurisdiction or had exercised its discretion wrongly, it may strike down the decision on the basis of illegality.|$|E
