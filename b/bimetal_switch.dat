50|$|The next picture {{shows the}} two {{overheat}} cutouts. The bimetal cutout (left) operates if the device overheats because the intake is blocked or the fan fails, and resets once the heater cools after the obstruction is removed. The thermal fuse (right) is a failsafe backup device that will disconnect the heating element permanently {{in case of}} extreme overheating causing risk of fire, usually because the <b>bimetal</b> <b>switch</b> fails to operate (e.g. due to its contacts welding together).|$|E
50|$|Many new dishwashers feature microprocessor-controlled, sensor-assisted wash cycles that {{adjust the}} wash {{duration}} to {{the quantity of}} dirty dishes (sensed by changes in water temperature) or the amount of dirt in the rinse water (sensed chemically/optically). This can save water and energy if the user runs a partial load. In such dishwashers the electromechanical rotary switch often used to control the washing cycle {{is replaced by a}} microprocessor but most sensors and valves are still required to be present. However, pressure switches (some dishwashers use a pressure switch and flow meter) are not required in most microprocessor controlled dishwashers as they use the motor and sometimes a rotational position sensor to sense the resistance of water; when it senses there is no cavitation it knows it has the optimal amount of water. A <b>bimetal</b> <b>switch</b> or wax motor opens the detergent door during the wash cycle.|$|E
50|$|The first {{electric}} stoves used {{heating elements}} made of high-resistance metal to produce heat. The stovetop (range) surface {{had one or}} more circular heating elements, insulated with compressed magnesia and sheathed in a spiral metal tube. Heating elements for the oven are of similar construction but an elongated loop to distribute heat. Elements were made as plug-in consumer-replaceable parts and could also be easily removed for cleaning. Temperature of cooking elements was regulated by adjusting a <b>bimetal</b> thermostat control <b>switch,</b> which switched power on and off to control the average heating effect of the elements.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} a thermal study of a thermal energy {{harvester}} based on the coupling of a bimetallic strip heat engine with a piezoelectric membrane for wasted heat scavenging. Such a harvester is dedicated to power autonomous systems such as wireless sensor nodes. For {{a better understanding of}} the working principle of the system, it is compulsory to have a good understanding of the thermal specificities and phenomenon taking place inside the harvester. Attention is consequently focused on the thermal modeling of the harvester in static mode using the equivalence between the electrical and thermal quantities. This first modeling step allowed the improvement of the thermal properties inside the system by increasing the thermal gradient across it. However, the bimetal being the active part of the system has not been taken into account in this model and shadow zones persisted regarding the bimetal operation windows as a function of its snapping temperatures and hysteresis. To overcome this, a dynamic model is proposed in this paper taking into account the <b>bimetal</b> as a <b>switched</b> capacitance alternatively in contact with the hot source and the cold surface. This last model completed the static one by predicting the bimetalâ€™s operation windows in function of its intrinsic properties and the operation range evolution in function of the snapping temperature first and then in function of the bimetal thermal hysteresis. Moreover, experimental measurements enable to validate the proposed model and to point out the most powerful bimetals for scavenging higher amounts of power...|$|R
