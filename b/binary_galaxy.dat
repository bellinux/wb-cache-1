Using precisely defined identification criteria, {{a sample of}} 156 <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> systems is selected from the Zwicky Catalog of Galaxies and Clusters of Galaxies. Data on their magnitudes, morphological types, radial velocities, angular separations, et cetera are presented. Accurate, new radial velocities for both components of 66 of the pairs have been measured. Substantial effort is directed towards establishing a sample of binary galaxies in which all sources of systematic bias and statistical error are well understood. With {{particular attention to the}} removal of selection effects, extensive statistical and dynamical analyses of these data lead to several conclusions: The ratio of the mass-to-light ratio in early-type galaxies to that in late-types is 2. 0 [ [...] . ] 0. 5. The distribution of spatial separations r between binary galaxies has an approximately r[ [...] . ] dependence. A variety of dynamical models for <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> systems are viable; however, they all require total mass-to-light ratios for spirals far larger than conventional (rotation curve) values. The most plausible interpretation of the <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> data requires that spiral galaxies possess halos containing [ [...] . ] 10 times the disk mass and have total mass-to-light ratios [ [...] . ]. It is shown that previous studies of binary galaxies have probably underestimated masses by a factor [ [...] . ] 10 primarily because selection biases (particularly those toward small projected separations) were ignored. There is some evidence against halos containing significant mass on scales very large compared to 100 kpc. Orbits of moderate eccentricity are more consistent with the present data than either purely circular or purely radial (probably excluded) ones. A catalog of small groups of galaxies is generated by identifying regions of the sky in which the surface number-density of galaxies is enhanced. The determinations of both group existence and membership are accomplished by well-defined procedures and are based entirely on the distribution of galaxies in the sky. A variety of data on the groups, their component galaxies, and those galaxies not assigned to groups (i. e. field galaxies) is presented. The generally small velocity dispersions of the groups validate the group identification algorithm. Using the available data, statistical analyses of the galaxy luminosity function in groups, the group dynamics, and the multiplicity function are described. The luminosity function is shown to be similar to that in rich clusters, well fit by a Schechter function with [ [...] . ] and [ [...] . ], and useful for estimating group distances. The dynamical analysis indicated that the groups are bound and relaxed, and gives typical mass-to-light ratios of [ [...] . ].

40|$|A tidal {{explanation}} for the observation by Holmberg that the satellites of edge-on disk galaxies tend to avoid the sector within + or - 30 deg of the major axes of the disk galaxies is considered. It is shown that satellites with small orbit-to-disk inclinations {{are likely to become}} compact and consequently be left out in Holmberg's survey due to the resemblance to stars. The explanation is supported by the observation of an excess of compact galaxies near the major-axis direction of edge-on disk galaxies. The disk tidal explanation also predicts that the asymmetry should be weaker with larger satellites. It is found that the Karachentsev (1972, 1980) <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> sample, where the typical companion is comparable to the primary galaxy, shows no Holmberg effect.

The simulations include radiative cooling, star formation and black hole (BH) accretion {{and the associated}} feedback processes. We find for Sp-Sp mergers, that the peak star formation rate and BH accretion rate decrease and the growth timescales of the central black holes and newly formed stars increase with higher progenitor mass ratios. The termination of star formation by BH feedback in disk mergers is significantly less important for higher progenitor mass ratios (e. g. 3 : 1 and higher). In addition, the inclusion of BH feedback suppresses efficiently star formation in dry E-E mergers and mixed E-Sp mergers.

40|$|Using {{a sample}} of 89 {{snapshots}} from 58 hydrodynamic <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> major merger simulations, we find that stellar remnants are mostly oblate while dark matter halos are mostly prolate or triaxial. The stellar minor axis and the halo major axis are almost always nearly perpendicular. This can be understood by considering the influence of angular momentum and dissipation during the merger. If binary mergers of spiral galaxies {{are responsible for the}} formation of elliptical galaxies or some subpopulation thereof, these galaxies can be expected to be oblate and inhabit their halos with the predicted shapes and orientations. These predictions are potentially relevant to observational studies of weak gravitational lensing, where one must stack many optically aligned galaxies {{in order to determine the}} shape of the resulting stacked mass distribution.

IRAS 03158 + 4227 is confirmed as a component of an equal-luminosity <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> with a nuclei separation of 47 / (h/ 75) kpc. A long lopsided tail emanating from the companion, which harbours an active nucleus, is the most prominent peculiar feature of the binary. The results of numerical simulations admit the interpretation of this structure as a product of the tidal interaction between the two components. If the infrared-activity of IRAS 03158 + 4227 is also dynamically triggered by this process, this would implicate that the ULIRG phenomenon is not restricted to the final stage of a binary merger.

'Isopleths' for the probability distribution are presented for a few values of the eccentricity to illustrate the underlying cause of pileup at certain parts of the regression curves.

40|$|We use a large {{suite of}} hydrodynamical {{simulations}} of <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> mergers {{to construct and}} calibrate a physical prescription for computing the effective radii and velocity dispersions of spheroids. We implement this prescription within a semi-analytic model embedded in merger trees extracted from the Bolshoi Lambda-CDM N-body simulation, accounting for spheroid growth via major and minor mergers as well as disk instabilities. We find that without disk instabilities, our model does not predict sufficient numbers of intermediate mass early-type galaxies in the local universe. Spheroids also form earlier in models with spheroid growth via disk instabilities. Our model correctly predicts the normalization, slope, and scatter of the low-redshift size-mass and Fundamental Plane relations for early type galaxies. It predicts a degree of curvature in the Faber-Jackson relation that is not seen in local observations, but this could be alleviated if higher mass spheroids have more bottom-heavy initial mass functions. The model also correctly predicts the observed strong evolution of the size-mass relation for spheroids out to higher redshifts, {{as well as the}} slower evolution in the normalization of the Faber-Jackson relation.

The probability distributions of the projected separation and the velocity difference have been calculated considering the contamination of optical pairs, and the mass-to-light ratio has been determined based on the maximum likelihood method. The best estimate of M/L in the B band for 57 pairs is found to be 28 âˆ¼ 36 depending on the orbital parameters and the distribution of optical pairs (solar unit, H_ 0 = 50 km s^- 1 Mpc^- 1). The best estimate of M/L for 30 pure spiral pairs is found to be 12 âˆ¼ 16. These results are relatively smaller than those obtained in previous studies, but consistent with each other within the errors. Although the number of pairs with large separation is significantly increased compared to previous samples, M/L does not show any tendency of increase, but found to be almost independent of the separation of pairs beyond 100 kpc.

In this first paper {{in a series}} we investigate the effects of merging on the entropy of the hot intracluster gas, specifically {{with regard to the}} ability of merging to heat and disrupt cluster "cool-cores. " We find, in line with recent works, that the effect of fluid instabilities that are well-resolved in grid-based codes is to significantly mix the gases of the two clusters and to significantly increase the entropy of the gas of the final merger remnant. This result is characteristic of mergers over a range of initial mass ratio and impact parameter. In line with this, we find that the kinetic energy associated with random motions is higher in our merger remnants which have high entropy floors, indicating the motions have efficiently mixed the gas and heated the cluster core with gas of initially high entropy.

The sample of galaxy pairs is selected to contain galaxies in close, major interactions (i. e. projected separations 3 Ïƒ. We compare the H[*]i gas fraction of the galaxies with the triggered star formation present in that galaxy. When compared to the star formation rates (SFRs) of non-pair galaxies matched in mass, redshift, and local environment, {{we find that the}} star formation enhancement is weakly positively correlated (âˆ¼ 2. 5 Ïƒ) with H[*]i gas fraction. In order to help understand the physical mechanisms driving this weak correlation, we also present results from a small suite of <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> merger simulations with varying gas fractions. The simulated galaxies indicate that larger initial gas fractions are associated with lower levels of interaction-triggered star formation (relative to an identical galaxy in isolation), but also show that high gas fraction galaxies have higher absolute SFRs prior to an interaction.

In particular, the arm- and looplike morphologies of the observed tidal debris can only be produced by the kinematically cold material of the disk components of the accreted galaxies. The tidal features that arise from such "cold-accretion" events onto a massive elliptical are visible for significantly longer timescales than the features produced by elliptical-elliptical mergers (about 1 - 2 Gyr vs. a few hundred million years). Mass ratios of the order of 1 : 10 between the accreting elliptical and the accreted disk are sufficient to match the brightness of the observed debris. Furthermore, stellar population synthesis models and simple order-of-magnitude calculations indicate that the colors of the tidal features generated in such minor cold-accretion events are relatively red, in agreement with the observations. The minor cold-accretion events that explain the presence, brightness, and structural and color properties of the tidal debris cause only a modest mass and luminosity increase in the accreting massive elliptical. These results, coupled with the relative statistical frequencies of disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies in the field, suggest that massive ellipticals assemble most of their mass well before their tidal debris forms through the accretion of relatively little, kinematically cold material rather than in very recent, dissipationless major mergers...|$|E

We conduct a numerical analysis distinguishing between regular and chaotic orbits {{as well as between}} trapped and escaping orbits, considering only unbounded motion for several energy levels. In order to distinguish safely and with certainty between ordered and chaotic motion, we apply the Smaller ALingment Index (SALI) method. It is of particular interest to locate the escape basins through the openings around the collinear Lagrangian points L_ 1 and L_ 2 and relate them with the corresponding spatial distribution of the escape times of the orbits. Our exploration takes place both in the configuration (x,y) and in the phase (x,áº‹) space in order to elucidate the escape process as well as the overall orbital properties of the galactic system. Our numerical analysis reveals the strong dependence of the properties of the considered escape basins with the total orbital energy, with a remarkable presence of fractal basin boundaries along all the escape regimes. It was also observed, that for energy levels close to the critical escape energy the escape rates of orbits are large, while for much higher values of energy most of the orbits have low escape periods or they escape immediately to infinity. We hope our outcomes to be useful for a further understanding of the escape mechanism in <b>binary</b> <b>galaxy</b> models.

A numerical code has been constructed {{for the study}} of the evolution of interacting <b>binary</b> <b>galaxies.</b> This "multiple three-body" algorithm (MTBA) essentially involves N concurrent three-body integrations; it is the sum of the interactions of the perturber with each of the N particles comprising the primary "galaxy" that determines the binary orbital evolution. MTBA incorporates a violent relaxation phase that allows the particles to redistribute themselves in the gravitational field of the perturber prior to the full binary orbital evolution calculation. This redistribution is important for systems with an initially strong tidal potential; their predicted merger times are 50 - 100 % larger than previously estimated. Tabulated merger times for both circular and elliptical orbits demonstrate that typical close <b>binary</b> <b>galaxies</b> will merge in about twice their initial binary orbital periods, roughly [ [...] . ] years. This timescale depends strongly on the binary separation, weakly on its mass ratio, and less on initial galaxy rotation than has heretofore been suggested. A specific interacting binary simulation is described in detail in the first paper. Surface brightness maps, structural parameters, and rotation properties are described at various times during the evolution, followed by a discussion of the properties of the merger remnant. Many of the results reported here are consistent with those obtained from the larger, more expensive N-body simulations. For the second paper, MTBA is altered so that each "galaxy" is represented by a configuration of test particles. Simulated tidal interactions between these "galaxies" are matched to the measured properties of real binaries in an effort to determine the physical state of each observed pair. The catalog of isolated galaxy pairs prepared by Karachentsev has been culled for its E-E constituents. CCD pictures and long-slit spectroscopic observations have been obtained at KPNO for the most photometrically distorted of these systems. Such pairs very likely represent strongly interacting, physically associated, <b>binary</b> elliptical <b>galaxies.</b> Radial variations of rotation velocity and velocity dispersion are extracted from the spectroscopic data for each of the two galaxies in a given pair. The combined spectroscopic and photometric data for that binary can be reproduced by an appropriate projection of a particular numerical simulation of the system. Some constraints can be placed on the masses of the galaxies, their internal dynamical configurations, and the properties of their relative orbit, including the three-dimensional orientation of the pair. Detailed results are presented for two pairs, K 99 and K 564. NGC 1587, the brighter component of K 99, has the highest rotation rate known for an E 2 galaxy, with a value [ [...] . ] = 0. 6...|$|R

40|$|A {{review is}} made of the astrophysical {{arguments}} with regard to neutrino properties. It is shown that the best fit to the present baryon density and He- 4 abundance is obtained with three neutrino species. It is also shown that astrophysical constraints on neutrino and axion lifetime-mass combinations rule out weakly interacting particles with lifetimes between 1 / 1000 to 10 to the 23 rd sec for M up to 10 MeV. There is an allowed astrophysical window for neutrinos with M up to 10 MeV and tau less than 1000 sec. The possible role of massive neutrinos in the dark mass of galaxies is discussed. It is shown that the baryon density in the universe {{is comparable to the}} density obtained from the dynamics of <b>binary</b> <b>galaxies.</b> Therefore, massive neutrinos are only required if the cosmological mass density is greater than that implied by binaries and small groups of galaxies. The only objects which might imply such high densities are large clusters. For neutrinos to cluster with these large clusters requires a neutrino mass of at least 3 eV...|$|R
