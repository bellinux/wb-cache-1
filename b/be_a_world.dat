40|$|This paper {{discusses}} “inclusionism ” in {{the context}} of David Lewis’s modal realism (and {{in the context}} of parasitic accounts of modality such as John Divers’s agnosticism about possible worlds). This is the doctrine that everything <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world.</b> I argue that this doctrine would be beneficial to Divers-style agnosticism; that it suggests a reconfiguration of the concept of actuality in modal realism; and finally that it suffers from an as-yet unsolved difficulty, the problem of the unmarried husbands. This problem also shows that Stephen Yablo’s analysis of “intrinsic ” is inadequate. 1 Isolationism and inclusionism In his paper “Intrinsicness”, Stephen Yablo describes a revised version of David Lewis’s modal realism, incorporating the doctrine he calls inclusionism: that “Some worlds contain others as proper parts ” (Yablo 1999, p. 483). Which worlds might those be? Yablo’s inclusionist says that every world that properly contains anything has <b>a</b> <b>world</b> as <b>a</b> proper part; that is, every part of <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> every mereological fusion of <b>worlds</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> you <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> I <b>am</b> <b>a</b> <b>world,</b> for all intents and purposes, everything <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>world.</b> 1 This view has several benefits. 1) Yablo is particularly interested in its surprising benefit of providing an anal-ysis of “intrinsic”.

5|$|In February 1941, Roosevelt sent Conant to Britain {{as head of}} {{a mission}} that also {{included}} Frederick L. Hovde from Purdue University and Carroll L. Wilson from MIT, to evaluate the research being carried out there and the prospects for cooperation. The 1940 Tizard Mission had revealed that American technology was some years behind that of Britain in many fields, most notably radar, and cooperation was eagerly sought. Conant had lunch with Prime Minister Winston Churchill and Frederick Lindemann, his leading scientific adviser, and an audience with King George VI at Buckingham Palace. At a subsequent meeting, Lindemann told Conant about British progress towards developing an atomic bomb. What most impressed Conant was the British conviction that it was feasible. That the British program was ahead of the American one raised the possibility in Conant's mind that the German nuclear energy project might be even further ahead, as Germany was generally acknowledged to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> leader in nuclear physics. Later that year, Churchill, as Chancellor of the University of Bristol, conferred an honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Conant in absentia.|$|E

He made {{appearances}} against the Texas Rangers in the League Division Series, the Baltimore Orioles in the League Championship Series, and the Atlanta Braves in the World Series. Lloyd was credited with the win in game4 of the 1996 World Series, becoming the first Australian player to do so, as well as becoming the first Australian to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>World</b> Series champion when the Yankees won in 1996 and again in 1998.|$|E

5|$|The fortifications {{played an}} {{important}} part in the conflicts in North Wales over the coming centuries. They were involved in the Glyndŵr Rising of the early 15th century and the Wars of the Roses in the late 15th century. Despite declining in military significance following the succession of the Tudor dynasty to the throne in 1485, they were pressed back into service during the English Civil War in the 17th century. In the aftermath of the conflict, Parliament ordered the slighting, or deliberate destruction, of parts of Conwy and Harlech, but the threat of a pro-Royalist invasion from Scotland ensured that Caernarfon and Beaumaris remained intact. By the end of the 17th century, however, the castles were ruinous. They became popular with visiting artists during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and visitor numbers increased as access to the region improved during the Victorian period. The British state invested heavily in the castles and town walls during the 20th century, restoring many of their medieval features. In 1986 the sites were collectively declared to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>World</b> Heritage Site, as outstanding examples of fortifications and military architecture built in the 13th century, and are now operated as tourist attractions by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw.|$|E
5|$|Entering the {{hyperspace}} pocket, {{the group}} find the Elsa and investigate the area, encountering both Albedo and Virgil and learning that the Vessels of Anima powering their E.S. mecha {{are key to}} the Testaments' plans. They are then confronted by Mantel—who reveals himself as the Red Testament—and T-elos. T-elos almost kills KOS-MOS, but Shion's pendant activates, apparently transporting them to the planet Miltia fifteen years into the past, which is revealed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> within Shion's subconscious. They are attacked by Voyager, who is beaten back by a redesigned KOS-MOS. During the group's time there, Shion learns the true events that caused Miltia's fall; her father, Kevin, Margulis and Mizrahi were attempting to control the Zohar through experiments involving both Shion and her mother, but when U-TIC and Federation forces clashed, Kevin and Margulis released unstable combat Realians which slaughtered nearly everyone in the battle. The trauma caused the young Shion to resonate with the Zohar, summoning the Gnosis and awakening U-DO; it was only Mizrahi's self-sacrifice in sealing away Miltia that prevented the chaos from spreading. The group fight Virgil before he is calmed by the spirit of Febronia—who tended {{him when he was}} injured on Miltia and with whom he formed an attachment prior to her death—and follows her into the afterlife. The Red Testament also appears, revealing his true identity as Kevin and asking Shion to join him.|$|E
