5000|$|Told in a non-linear, {{stream of}} {{consciousness}} style, the film depicts the deceitful {{relationship between a}} master and his two servants. The master's actions and behavior are very mysterious and secretive, which causes his manservant to be suspicious of his whereabouts. The Master is seen doing such things as writing a letter in the secrecy of his study room, gathering eggs {{from the side of}} a cliff, and it is even implied he had an affair with the female servant. One day, the shocked manservant discovers the Master in a <b>barn</b> <b>feeding</b> the eggs he gathered to a huge boar, much to the Master's shame. Sometime later, the Master is shown setting the pig off into the wild, perhaps a form of reconciliation with the male servant (who is implied to have an infatuation with his master). With his mental health deteriorating, the Master sheds his clothing and jumps {{over the edge of the}} cliff, presumably to his death. Sometime after these events, the two servants are seen tending to the Master's now vacant bedroom, and appear to be going their separate ways. However, the manservant secretly follows the woman and watches aghast as she begins walking towards the same cliff the Master committed suicide on. What happens next is unclear, and the film ends with the following epilogue: ...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} feed transition from <b>barn</b> <b>feeding</b> to pasture on the course of ruminal pH a study with 8 lactating dairy cows was undertaken. Therefore, an indwelling pH-measurement and data transmitting system was used. The experiment started at 27 th March 2012 and a gradual transition from <b>barn</b> <b>feeding</b> to pasture feeding was done (periods P 1 -P 6). After 7 days of <b>barn</b> <b>feeding</b> (P 1) animals were given pasture progressively with increasing grazing time from 2 to 7 h/d (P 2, day 8 - 14). In P 3 (day 15 - 21) the cows spent 7 hours/d on pasture. Beginning on day 22, animals had 20 h/d access to pasture (continuous grazing), only semi-daily interrupted for 2 hours for milking and additional feeding (P 4 -P 6). During the <b>barn</b> <b>feeding</b> period (P 1), average ruminal pH was highest (6. 44) and deviation of H+-ion concentration was lowest. In P 2 and P 3 ruminal pH depressed significantly (6. 24 and 6. 21 resp.) and increased again from P 4 to P 6 (6. 30, 6. 33, 6. 36 resp.).

It is based on a serie of books on farm buildings published in Belgium between 1847 and 1884. On a methological level, it follows a bibliography made by the French agronomist Louis Bouchard-Huzard in 1870. According to Bouchard, various Belgian architects wrote on farmstead building and were involved in an architextural debate on ways to modernize farmsteads. An example of the innovative thinking spread by the architects books {{can be found in the}} idea of the <b>barns</b> <b>feeding</b> corridor.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was the {{continuous}} measurement of ruminal pH in grazing dairy cows to monitor the diets effects on ruminal pH value. A novel indwelling pH-measurement and data transmitting system was given to 6 multiparous cows orally. Ruminal pH was measured every 600 [*]sec over a 40 [*]d period. After <b>barn</b> <b>feeding</b> and changeover to pasture, the following 3 treatments (2 cows/treatment) were included in the measurement period: continuous grazing (G), continuous grazing plus 4 [*]kg/d of hay fed twice daily (GH), and continuous grazing plus 4 [*]kg/d of concentrate (GC). Ruminal pH decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) from 6. 58 ± 0. 15 to pH 6. 19 ± 0. 19 during feed changeover to pasture. Mean ruminal pH for G, GH, and GC was 6. 36, 6. 56, and 6. 01. Mean 24 -h minimum pH was 5. 95, 6. 20 and, 5. 58. The time pH was below 6. 3, 6. 0, 5. 8, and 5. 5, for G it was 583, 91, 26, and 3 [*]min/d, for GH it was 97, 12, 0, and 0 [*]min/d and for GC it was 1126, 621, 347, and 101 [*]min/d, respectively. Results were significantly influenced by the diet. The indwelling pH-measurement and data transmitting system is a very useful and proper tool for long-term measurement of ruminal pH in cows...|$|E
40|$|Background: The Tibetan pig is a pig breed with {{excellent}} grazing characteristics indigenous to the Qinghai–Tibet plateau in China. Under conditions of <b>barn</b> <b>feeding,</b> 90 % of its diet consists of forage grass, which helps meet its nutritional needs. The present study aimed to isolate and identify a cellulolytic bacterium from the Tibetan pig's intestine and investigate cellulase production by this bacterium. The study {{purpose is to}} provide a basic theory for the research and development of herbivore characteristics and to identify a source of probiotics from the Tibetan pig. Results: A cellulolytic bacterium was isolated from a Tibetan pig's intestine and identified based on morphological, physiological, and biochemical characteristics as well as 16 S rRNA analysis; it was designated Bacillus subtilis BY- 2. Examination of its growth characteristics showed that its growth curve entered the logarithmic phase after 8 – 12  h and the stable growth phase being between 20 and 40  h. The best carbon source for fermentation was 1 % corn flour, while 2 % peptone and yeast powder compound were the best nitrogen sources. The initial pH during fermentation was 5. 5, with 4 % inoculum, resulting in a high and stable amount of enzyme in 24 – 48  h. Conclusions: The isolated BY- 2 strain rapidly grew and produced cellulase. We believe that BY- 2 cellulase can help overcome the shortage of endogenous animal cellulase, improve the utilization rate of roughage, and provide strain sources for research on porcine probiotics...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} aims {{to apply a}} {{methodology}} developed for the qualitative assessment of animal behaviour to the evaluation of dairy cattle welfare. Six farms (2 tie stall, 2 straw yard and 2 cubicle systems) were filmed to produce six 3. 5 min videos. Each of them contained 4 clips: overall view of the <b>barn,</b> <b>feeding,</b> milking, individual animals. Ten undergraduate students were instructed to provide qualitative assessment of videos using Free Choice Profiling (FCP). Data from FCP were subjected to Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA). GPA showed a significant consensus among observers. The 2 main dimensions of the consensus profile explained 39. 5 and 26. 8 % of variation, respectively. Observers characterised the first dimension with terms ranging from constrictive to comfortable conditions and the second one in terms of cleanliness/dirtiness. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was conducted using the scores of the farms {{on the first two}} dimensions of GPA and the data gathered through the ANI 35 L scheme. The two main dimensions of PCA explained 91 % of variation. The first dimension of GPA (unrestricted; 0. 39), ANI’s sheet 1 (Locomotion; 0. 42), sheet 2 (Social interaction; 0. 42) and sheet 6 (Summary scores; 0. 43) showed higher loadings on the first component of PCA, whereas the second dimension of GPA (cleanliness; 0. 61), sheet 3 (Flooring; 0. 45) and sheet 4 (Stockmanship; 0. 49) were more correlated with the second component of PCA.

Locally superabundant rodent species in the weight class of several grams per individual usually make up the single largest proportion of prey. Barn Owls consume more rodents than possibly any other creature. This makes the Barn Owl one of the most economically valuable wildlife animals to farmers, millers, etc. Farmers and others found these owls effective in keeping down rodent pests, and they encouraged Barn Owl habitation by providing nest sites. In the few months between hatching and fledging a clutch of six owlets can consume up to 70 lb of rodents.|$|R
