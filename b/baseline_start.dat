Our study examined intrusive thoughts {{as a predictor of}} lingering symptoms in breast cancer survivors in the year following treatment. Method: Data come from the Moving Beyond Cancer psychoeducational intervention trial, aimed at easing the transition from patient to survivor. Women (n = 558) completed psychosocial questionnaires within 4 weeks posttreatment and again 2, 6, and 12 months later. We examined intrusive thoughts about cancer at the baseline assessment as a predictor of fatigue, sleep problems, pain, breast cancer-specific symptoms, depressive symptoms, negative affect, and quality of life using growth curve modeling, controlling for study condition and other covariates. Results: Intrusive thoughts were associated with higher levels of all symptoms at baseline and at the 12 -month assessment. Intrusive thoughts also influenced the trajectory of pain, depressive symptoms, negative affect, and physical functioning over time; women with higher intrusions at <b>baseline</b> <b>started</b> worse and improved over time, whereas those with lower intrusions remained at a constant, lower level over time. Intrusions were not associated with the trajectory of fatigue, sleep, breast cancer-specific symptoms, or mental functioning; women with higher intrusions at <b>baseline</b> <b>started</b> worse and remained worse over time. Conclusion: Intrusive thoughts are associated with enduring elevations in behavioral symptoms and impaired quality of life in the year after breast cancer treatment and may be a risk factor for poor outcomes. © 2013 American Psychological Association...|$|R

40|$|The overall aims of {{this thesis}} are to {{describe}} women’s experiences {{of breast cancer}} from a gender perspective, describe women’s experiences of an art therapy intervention {{and the effects of}} an art therapy intervention on self-rated coping resources and quality of life. The thesis presents results from a study with 42 women with primary breast cancer without distance metastasis who participated in a randomized intervention study with art therapy carried out between 2001 and 2004. All women were recruited as they were referred to the Department of Oncology at Umeå University Hospital in northern Sweden for postoperative radiotherapy. They were randomized to an intervention group (n = 20) with individual art therapy for 1 hour/week during postoperative radiotherapy, or to a control group (n = 22). The women were between 37 – 69 years old and had a range of educational and socioeconomic backgrounds. All 42 women completed questionnaires in connection with three interview occasions during six months: at <b>baseline</b> (<b>start</b> of radiotherapy), two and six months later. The questionnaires assessed coping resources, quality of life, symptoms, and self-image. In addition, all women were interviewed about their experiences, and were asked to write a weekly diary about their experiences of breast cancer during the six months of participation. All women signed a written consent form in which they were assured voluntariness and that ending their participation would not affect the care or medical treatment in any way. The study protocol was approved by the Umeå University Ethical Committee at the Medical Faculty (archive number 99 - 386). In this thesis, part of results from the study is reported. The results presented in the first study show an overall increase in coping resources as measured by the Coping Resources Inventory (CRI) among women with breast cancer after taking part in the art therapy intervention. Significant differences were seen between the study group and the control group in the total score on the second occasion and in the social domain on the second and third occasions. The second study reports results of the art therapy intervention, with regard to quality of life aspects as measured by the instruments WHOQOL-BREF and EORTC QLQ-BR 23, at <b>baseline</b> (<b>start</b> of radiotherapy) and two and six months later. Significant increases in total health, total quality of life, physical health and psychological health were found in the art therapy group compared to the control group. A significant positive difference was also found within the intervention group, concerning future perspectives, body image and systemic therapy side effects. The third study builds on previous quantitative results, drawing on gender theories and, taking a discursive approach in analyzing the women’s use of interpretative repertoires in diaries and interviews. The results show a connection between participation in art therapy, talking about protecting one’s own boundaries, and scoring higher on the CRI compared to the control group. A connection between the control group, repertoire conflicts, and lower scores on the CRI was also found. The fourth study presents further knowledge about women’s trajectories, in art therapy, towards helpful management of restraining boundaries. We were inspired by discursive psychology and the analytic concept of subject position. The result shows that art therapy helped women to get access to subject positions that enabled them to protect and strengthen their boundaries and put forward their own needs. Taken together, the results from all four studies support art therapy as a valuable complement in oncology care and rehabilitation of women with primary breast cancer in similar contexts...|$|E
40|$|Background: Group Cognitive Stimulation Therapy (CST) {{has been}} found to be {{effective}} in improving cognitive functioning and quality of life in people with dementia. However, little is known about whether it would be effective if delivered in an individual format. Design: A small n within-subjects, repeated measures design was used, with participants acting as their own control, to assess whether Individual CST was beneficial for people with vascular dementia. Method: 27 research packs were distributed, 12 returned the opt-in slip, eight completed the therapy and five participants (with a diagnosis of vascular dementia) were included in this study. Participants completed a four-week baseline period, seven-weeks of Individual CST, followed by a four-week follow up period. Outcome variables were cognitive functioning (assessed at start of baseline and end of intervention), quality of life and self efficacy (assessed at start of <b>baseline,</b> <b>start</b> of intervention, end of intervention and end of follow up) and anxiety and depression (assessed weekly). Results: Cognitive functioning was maintained or improved in four out of five participants. Improvements tended to be in the memory and language domains but declined in the attention domain. Participant quality of life and anxiety and depression ratings were also maintained or improved following the intervention. Conclusion: This research suggests that Individual CST may be beneficial for people with vascular dementia in terms of maintaining or improving cognitive function, improving quality of life and mood. This has implications for the provision of future interventions for dementia. Further research is required to further build on these findings in addition to assessing cost-effectiveness before Individual CST is offered as a therapeutic option...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} the relations linking self-efficacy and coping to {{quality of life}} (QOL) and social participation and what effect self-efficacy, changes in self-efficacy, and coping style have on long-term QOL and social participation. DESIGN: Prospective clinical cohort study. SETTING: General hospitals, rehabilitation centers. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with newly acquired brain injury (ABI) (N= 148) were assessed at <b>baseline</b> (<b>start</b> outpatient rehabilitation or discharge hospital/inpatient rehabilitation; mean time since injury, 15 wk) and 1 year later (mean time since injury, 67 wk). INTERVENTIONS: Not applicable. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: QOL was measured with the EuroQuol 5 D (the EQ- 5 D index and the EQ- 5 D visual analog scale [EQ VAS]) and the 9 -item Life Satisfaction Questionnaire (LiSat- 9), social participation with the modified Frenchay Activities Index, coping with the Coping Inventory for Stressful Situations, and self-efficacy with the Traumatic Brain Injury Self-efficacy Questionnaire. RESULTS: At baseline, self-efficacy moderated the effect of emotion-oriented coping on the EQ- 5 D index and of avoidance coping on the EQ VAS. Self-efficacy mediated the relation between emotion-oriented coping and LiSat- 9. An increase in self-efficacy over time predicted better scores on the EQ- 5 D index (beta=. 30), the EQ VAS (beta=. 49), and LiSat- 9 (beta=. 44) at follow-up. In addition, higher initial self-efficacy (beta=. 40) predicted higher LiSat- 9 scores at follow-up; higher initial emotion-oriented coping (beta=-. 23) predicted lower EQ VAS scores at follow-up. Higher modified Frenchay Activities Index scores at follow-up were predicted by higher self-efficacy (beta=. 19) and higher task-oriented coping (beta=. 14) at baseline (combined R(2) = 5. 1 %). CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy and coping predict long-term QOL but seem less important in long-term social participation. High self-efficacy protects against the negative effect of emotion-oriented coping. Enhancing self-efficacy in the early stage after ABI may have beneficial long-term effects...|$|E

An additional objective is to identify other psychosocial factors that may modify this relation. Methods/design: The study is designed as a prospective observational study of 120 severely obese children and adolescents (8 - 19 years) and their parents/caregivers undergoing an intensive combined lifestyle intervention during one year.

The primary outcome measurement is the gender and age-specific change in SDS-BMI. The children's general self-regulation abilities are evaluated by two behavioral computer tasks assessing two distinct aspects of self-regulation that are particularly relevant to controlling food intake: inhibitory control (Stop Signal Task) and sensitivity to reward (Balloon Analogue Risk Task). In addition to the computer tasks, a self-report measure of eating-specific self-regulation ability is used.

Following μCT analysis there were no differences between CON and VCD, but OVX mice had lower bone volume fraction, trabecular thickness, and a trend for decreased connectivity density. These findings provide evidence that retention of residual ovarian tissue may protect aged follicle-depleted mice from accelerated bone loss to a lesser extent than that observed in young mice. 1...|$|R

40|$|Much of {{scientific}} progress stems from previously published findings, but searching through the vast sea {{of scientific}} publications is difficult. We often rely on metrics of scholarly authority {{to find the}} prominent authors but these authority indices do not differentiate authority based on research topics. We present Latent Topical-Authority Indexing (LTAI) for jointly modeling the topics, citations, and topical authority in a corpus of academic papers. Compared to previous models, LTAI differs in two main aspects. First, it explicitly models the generative process of the citations, rather than treating the citations as given. Second, it models each author's influence on citations of a paper based on the topics of the cited papers, {{as well as the}} citing papers. We fit LTAI to four academic corpora: CORA, Arxiv Physics, PNAS, and Citeseer. We compare the performance of LTAI against various <b>baselines,</b> <b>starting</b> with the latent Dirichlet allocation, to the more advanced models including author-link topic model and dynamic author citation topic model. The results show that LTAI achieves improved accuracy over other similar models when predicting words, citations and authors of publications.

40|$|Organ {{systems do}} not respond uniformly to changes in {{systemic}} oxygen delivery because of global and local redistributive mechanisms. We hypothesized that progressive hemodilution would evoke a different response in the microvascular oxygenation of the heart compared with kidney and gut. To evaluate this hypothesis, we studied the effect of stepwise isovolemic hemodilution on systemic hemodynamic and oxygenation parameters {{as well as the}} relation between systemic hematocrit (Ht) and microvascular PO(2) (microPO(2)) in heart, kidney, and intestines in an anesthetized and mechanically ventilated rat model. Baseline conditions were similar in the hemodilution group and in the control group. In the hemodilution group, Ht was diminished from 46. 6 +/- 3. 8 % to 7. 0 +/- 1. 8 % [mean +/- standard deviation (SD) ]. This group had no effect on measured hemodynamics; only when Ht fell below 10 % did blood pressure start to decrease. The microPO(2) values in heart, kidney, and intestines did not respond uniformly. Renal microPO(2) (56 +/- 10 mm Hg at <b>baseline)</b> <b>started</b> to decrease at a Ht of 38. 5 +/- 8. 6 %, whereas intestinal microPO(2) (59 +/- 6 mm Hg at <b>baseline)</b> did not <b>start</b> to decrease until Ht reached 17. 4 +/- 7. 1 %. Finally, cardiac microPO(2) (40 +/- 6 mm Hg at baseline) decreased only in the ultimate stage of the experiment at Ht of 8. 7 +/- 3. 5 %. Based on these observations, we conclude that the regulation of microvascular oxygenation during progressive anemia is specific for each organ system. The relation between these observations and organ function and damage needs to be determine...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss the use of {{stochastic}} league tables approach in cost-effectiveness analysis of diabetes interventions. It addresses the common grounds and differences with other methods of presenting uncertainty to decision-makers. This comparison uses the cost-effectiveness results of medical guidelines for Dutch diabetes type 2 patients in primary and secondary care. Stochastic league tables define the optimum expansion pathway as compared to <b>baseline,</b> <b>starting</b> with the least costly and most cost-effective intervention mix. Multi-intervention cost-effectiveness acceptability curves are used as a way to represent uncertainty information on the cost-effectiveness of single interventions as compared to a single alternative. The stochastic league table for diabetes interventions shows that in case of low budgets treatment of secondary care patients is the most likely optimum choice. Current care options of diabetes complications are shown to be inefficient compared to guidelines treatment. With more resources available one may implement all guidelines and improve efficiency. The stochastic league table approach and multi-intervention cost-effectiveness acceptability curves in uncertainty analysis lead to similar results. In addition, the stochastic league table approach provides policy makers with information on affordability by budget level. It fulfils more adequately the information requirements to choose between interventions, using the efficiency criterion. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|R
30|$|This section contextualizes {{this study}} in {{relation}} to previous work. Because most studies on BitTorrent and peer-to-peer caching use object replacement policies first applied to Web traffic as <b>baselines,</b> we <b>start</b> with an overview work on Web traffic caching. Next, we review work on caching traffic from BitTorrent and other peer-to-peer systems. When examining both Web and peer-to-peer traffic caching, we focus on results related {{to the effect of}} cache size and object replacement policies on cache effectiveness. After reviewing work focusing on caching, this section discusses locality-aware mechanisms proposed in the literature.|$|R
