5|$|The Mystic Seaport Light {{is subject}} to United States Coast Guard {{regulations}} to become operational, {{and because it is}} a full-sized replica of a lighthouse, requirements include supervisory schedules and installation of an emergency, <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> This was not a financial priority for Mystic Seaport in 1967 and it was not made a fully functional lighthouse.|$|E
25|$|Dive {{lights are}} {{critical}} safety equipment, {{as it is}} dark inside caves. Each diver generally carries a primary light, {{and at least one}} <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> A minimum of three lights is recommended. The primary light should last the planned duration of the dive, as should the backup lights.|$|E
25|$|Changes {{were again}} modest: Five smaller front fender vents {{replaced}} the three larger ones, and flat-finish rockers sans ribbing conferred a lower, less chunky appearance. New {{was a single}} <b>backup</b> <b>light,</b> mounted above the license plate. The previous models' wheel covers gave way to slotted six-inch Rally wheels with chrome beauty rings and lug nuts concealed behind chrome caps. Interior alterations were modest and included revised upholstery, and the handbrake moved from beneath the dash to between the seats. The convertible's optional hardtop was offered with a black vinyl cover, which was a fad among all cars at the time.|$|E
50|$|There {{was a small}} {{redesign}} on taillights {{with the}} <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> in the lower section. This was {{the last year for}} the 131.5 in wheelbase chassis for the New Yorker.|$|R
50|$|Small snoopy loops {{made from}} bicycle inner tubes {{are used to}} prevent <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> clipped to a dive harness from dangling, and large loops from car tubes are used to stow hoses against sling or sidemount cylinders.|$|R
50|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>lights</b> are {{generally}} clipped {{to the shoulder}} D-rings and held against the shoulder straps by rubber bands cut from bicycle inner tubes. Other methods are possible, but the inner tubes work and are easily replaced when they wear out.|$|R
2500|$|The 1970 Javelins {{featured}} a new front-end design {{with a wide}} [...] "twin-venturi" [...] front grille incorporating the headlamps and a longer hood. It also had a new rear end with full-width taillamps and a single center-mounted <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> This was a one-year-only design. Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. The exterior rear view mirror {{featured a}} new [...] "aero" [...] design {{and in some cases}} matched the car's body color. The three [...] "Big Bad" [...] exterior paints continued to be optional on the 1970 Javelins, but they now came with regular chrome bumpers. Underneath the restyle was a new front suspension featuring ball joints, upper and lower control arms, coil springs, and shock absorbers above the upper control arms, as well as trailing struts on the lower control arms.|$|E
2500|$|American Motors 1970 AMX {{advertising}} headlined, [...] "We {{made the}} AMX look tougher {{this year because}} it's tougher this year". They were mildly facelifted resembling the first two model years, but the changes were different {{enough to be a}} separate design for 1970. Featured was a new front end design with a longer hood that had a “power blister” with two large openings. These were a functional cold ram-air induction system with the popular [...] "Go Package" [...] available with the 360 and 390 engines. The new grille was flush and full-width incorporating the headlamps. The revised rear end also featured full-width taillamps and a single center mounted <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> Side marker lights were now shared with several other AMC models. Riding on the same wheelbase [...] as before, the changes increased the AMX's overall body length by about two inches (51 millimeters) to [...]|$|E
2500|$|The 1956 Bel Air {{received}} a face-lift {{with a more}} conventional full-width grille, pleasing those customers who didn't favor the Ferrari-inspired '55 front end. Distinctive two-tone bodyside treatments and graceful front and rear wheel openings completed the [...] "speedline" [...] restyling. Single housings incorporated the taillight, stoplight, and <b>backup</b> <b>light,</b> and the left one held the gas filler - an idea popularized on Cadillacs. Among the seven Bel Air models was a new Sport Sedan, a pillarless four-door hardtop that looked handsome with all the windows rolled down and allowed easy entry into the back seat. Production exceeded 103,000, compared to 128,000 two-door hardtops. Shapely two-door Nomad wagons topped the price chart at $2,608, but now carried the same interior and rear-wheel sheetmetal as other Bel Airs, lacking the original's unique trim. Only 7,886 were built. The least costly Bel Air, at $2,025, was the two-door sedan. Seatbelts, shoulder harnesses, and a padded dashboard were available, and full-size cars could even get the hot Corvette 225-horsepower engine. In 1956 sales material there was an optional rain-sensing automatic top, which was first seen on the 1951 LaSabre concept car. However, {{it is believed that}} it was never installed on a car. Popular Mechanics reported only 7.4% of owners in their survey ordered seat belts.|$|E
50|$|Divers {{engaging}} in penetration diving are conventionally taught to carry three lights - a primary <b>light</b> and two <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> - thereby virtually eliminating {{the risk of}} completely losing light inside the wreck. Nonetheless, total loss of visibility due to a silt-out remains a risk.|$|R
50|$|The body {{featured}} a full 12-volt electrical system. It supplied power to concealed four-beam headlights, parking/marker <b>lights,</b> brake <b>lights,</b> <b>backup</b> <b>lights,</b> electric windshield wipers, a single-speed heater blower, and a radio/public address system. With this equipment, the Boilermaker Special III {{was capable of}} day or night operation on most improved roads, including highways.|$|R
25|$|New grilles and four-segmented {{taillights}} {{highlighted the}} facelifted 1966 LeSabre models. Also new was a revised instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer replacing the round pod instruments and new interior door handles. Both base and Custom level series were continued. New standard safety features included a padded instrument panel, outside driver-side {{rear view mirror}} and <b>backup</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The rising {{commercial}} {{success of the}} Rally package made VAM ascend it to a trim level for 1972 and with that several improvements followed. The safety mechanism connecting the shifter to the ignition switch was discontinued, which meant the incorporation of a small safety lever {{on the side of}} the column to keep the ignition switch from accidentally turning into lock position with the vehicle in motion. The previously optional 8000 RPM tachometer became standard equipment along with AMC's new three-arm three-spoke sports steering wheel with a central cylindrical button. Low-back, smaller more bucket-like front reclining seats replaced the wide units of the previous two years, which meant a free space between both units over the transmission tunnel. The round floor shift base shared with 1968-1969 Javelins departed in favor of a new squared design. The bright rear panel got an aluminum turned appearance and the taillight lenses featured a new larger <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> and side stripes. The grille was changed from aluminum to plastic and an updated hood latch appeared. Mechanically, the front sway bar was passed on to the standard equipment list, but the biggest change of the year was present under the hood. The 1972 Rally engine was the VAM 252 six producing [...] at 4,600 rpm, 9.5:1 compression ratio, with a high-flow Carter RBS-PV1 single-barrel carburetor and the 266 degree camshaft, which was originally used in 1969-1970 VAM Javelins. Due to this, the [...] "232 SIX" [...] emblems were removed in favor of new [...] "252" [...] units.|$|E

50|$|<b>Backup</b> <b>lights</b> {{are carried}} {{in case the}} primary light fails during the dive.

50|$|All models got new, flatter dash trim panels, {{black on}} the lower two trims and aluminum-look on the fancier two. Base models {{received}} the flatter stainless hubcaps, and Stepsides got new squared-off taillights with built-in <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> and side markers, while the rear fenders were smoothed out where the old side markers were. Fuel doors were added on models equipped with a bed to hide the previously exposed fuel caps.|$|R
50|$|The 1970 {{taillights}} {{went all}} the way across the back of the car, with the <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> in the middle. In 1971, the backup lights were on the left and right instead of the middle. The taillight array also changed for 1972 onwards, with the Challenger now having four individual rectangular lamps.|$|E

50|$|Backup (reserve) {{lights are}} carried {{where they are}} {{unlikely}} to snag, and cause minimal drag, but can be reached and operated by one hand. Two are required for overhead diving. The storage position for backup lights is clipped to the chest D-rings and held against the harness by rubber bands, where they are tucked away and unlikely to snag, but remain easily accessible to both hands, and can be turned on before unclipping, so they can be easily found if dropped. Fresh non-rechargeable batteries should be installed before any dive where burn time of the <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> may be critical to safety, and burn time should allow exit from any point in the dive with a margin for problems.|$|E
50|$|Introduced in 1962, the Dodge Dart 440 {{model was}} the {{upmarket}} trim {{version of the}} Dodge Dart. Included was the standard equipment of the Dart and Dart 330, plus <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> and exterior moldings. The Dart 440 was available as a 4-door sedan, 2-door hardtop, 4-door hardtop, 2-door convertible and 4-door station wagon. The Dart 440 used the 116 in wheelbase shared with the Dart, Dart 330, and Polara 500.|$|R
5000|$|There are {{additional}} hazards when diving in darkness, such as dive light failure. This {{can result in}} losing vertical visual references and being unable to control depth or buoyancy, being unable to read instruments such as dive computers and diving cylinder contents gauges, and potential separation {{from the rest of}} the diving group, boat, or shore cover. Even with a functioning light, these hazards are still present in night diving. <b>Backup</b> <b>lights</b> are recommended.|$|R
50|$|Most jurisdictions {{mandate that}} people with disabilities must have unassisted use of the station. This is {{resolved}} with elevators, taking {{a number of people}} from street level to the unpaid ticketing area, and then from the paid area to the platform. In addition, there will be stringent requirements for emergencies, with <b>backup</b> <b>lighting,</b> emergency exits and alarm systems installed and maintained. Stations are a critical part of the evacuation route for passengers escaping from a disabled or troubled train.|$|R
5000|$|In modern usage {{the plural}} form [...] "candelabra" [...] is {{frequently}} {{used in the}} singular sense, with the true singular form [...] "candelabrum" [...] becoming rare. Likewise, [...] "candelabra" [...] and [...] "candelabras" [...] are preferred over [...] "candelabrums" [...] as the plural form.Although the electrification of indoor lighting has relegated candleholders {{to the status of}} <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> sources in most homes and other buildings, interior designers continue to model light fixtures and lighting accessories after candelabra and candlesticks. Accordingly, the term [...] "candelabra" [...] has entered common use as a collective term for small-based incandescent light bulbs used in chandeliers and other lighting fixtures made for decoration as well as lighting.|$|E
5000|$|The 1956 through 1958 A8 Checkers {{featured}} single headlights, 1953 Chevrolet taillights, and a thick, single-bar grille. In 1958, quad headlights became {{legal in}} the U.S., and Checkers featured the quad headlights {{from that time}} forward, along with a new egg-crate grille insert. Parking lights were housed in each {{far side of the}} grille insert. Taillights were also changed to the familiar vertical chrome strip housing dual red lenses. Early models also featured a single separate bumper-mounted <b>backup</b> <b>light.</b> Another change between the A8 and later models is the rear window. Originally flat in the A8 with a thicker [...] "C" [...] pillar, the rear window on later models wrapped around a thinner roof-line, affording improved all-around visibility.|$|E

50|$|Play was {{interrupted}} for 34 minutes {{because of a}} 22-minute partial power outage. Emergency generators provided <b>backup</b> <b>lighting.</b> The fire department (NOFD) rescued people from elevator seven, but other elevators {{were brought to the}} ground uneventfully. Attendees used double the usual amount of data for their cell phones. AT&T reported 78 gigabytes (GB) downloaded from 8 to 9 PM, about double from the peak the year before. NFL chief security officer Jeffrey Miller attributed fans' calmness to their preoccupation with their electronics.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{widespread}} use of Fresnel lenses, for a time, occurred in automobile headlamps, where they can shape the roughly parallel beam from the parabolic reflector to meet requirements for dipped and main-beam patterns, often both in the same headlamp unit (such as the European H4 design). For reasons of cost, weight, and impact resistance, newer cars have dispensed with glass Fresnel lenses, using multifaceted reflectors with plain polycarbonate lenses. However, Fresnel lenses continue in wide use in automobile tail, marker, and <b>backup</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Taillights on hardtop coupes and sedans still ran wall-to-wall, but {{the twin}} <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> were {{moved from the}} center to further outboard—approximately eight inches in from either fender side. Once again, the wagon {{received}} few changes at the rear, but added a new design for its optional woodgrain side trim, which filled in its upper bodysides. Its lower edge flowed downward aft of its peak {{at the leading edge}} above each front wheelhouse, in similar fashion to the Buick Skylark's side [...] "sweepspear" [...] styling cue.|$|R
5000|$|... 1999: For the {{beginning}} of this model year, the DOHC 3.5 L [...] "Shortstar" [...] engine was standard in the top-line GLS and optional on mid-level GL and base GX models. Early GLS models could be ordered with the 3.8L instead of the standard (for GLS) 3.5 L, but later on the 3.8 L was phased out and the 3.5 L became standard on all models. Decklids now wore a small Oldsmobile badge. In the previous model year, there was a complaint that some people couldn't tell that Intrigues were Oldsmobiles. If you look closely, you can read 'Oldsmobile' molded in the <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> lens in the taillight housing on all model years. All models now got a thicker, leather-wrapped steering wheel. New to the option list was GM's OnStar emergency/communications system. Integrated rear radio antenna was standard this year and after.|$|E

5000|$|For 1966, the 390-cubic-inch V8's {{power was}} {{increased}} to [...] The larger 428-cubic-inch (7.0 L) V-8 became optional, rated at 345 gross horsepower (257.4 kW) {{and providing a}} notable improvement in 0-60 acceleration to about 9 seconds. All models featured a new front clip. A flatter hood, re-shaped front fenders, new headlight buckets, new egg crate grille with large Thunderbird emblem, new bumper guards, a single bumper bar, and painted roll pan replaced the previous two model year's two-piece front bumper. The rear taillights were revised, now a 3 piece unit going the full width across the rear, the <b>backup</b> <b>light</b> now located in the center section replaced the formerly rear roll pan mounted lamps. A new Town Hardtop model was offered, featured a roof with blind quarter panels for a more 'formal' look (at the cost of rear visibility). The Landau {{was replaced by the}} blind quarter formal roofed Town Landau, which retained the previous model's padded roof and landau S-bars. It became by far the best-selling model, accounting for 35,105 of the 1966 model's 69,176 sales. The transmission used on early build 390 V8 equipped T-Birds was the Cruise-O-Matic MX, however late build 390 and all 428 V8 equipped T-Birds had the new C6 3 speed automatic installed.|$|E

25|$|Lights: Each cave diver {{should have}} at least three {{independent}} sources of light. One is considered the primary and is intended for general use during the dive. The others are considered <b>backup</b> <b>lights</b> and may be lower powered as they are not intended for exploration. Each light must have an expected burn time of at least the planned duration of the dive. If any diver loses light function so that they have fewer than three working lights, protocol requires that the dive is turned for all members of the dive team and exit started immediately.|$|R
5000|$|The {{flagship}} model was the Custom Royal. All hardtop coupe and Custom Royal-only convertible models were called [...] "Custom Royal Lancer", and the [...] "Custom Royal" [...] sedan gained the Lancer badge soon after its introduction as well. The Custom line featured unique chrome tailfins (although early model year cars went without this trim), special tail light surrounds, and an upscale interior. <b>Backup</b> <b>lights</b> were standard on the Custom line but optional on all others. The Custom Royal also featured the hemi 270 CID Super Red Ram engine.|$|R
