40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) plays an {{important}} role in the neovascularization of ischaemic retinal diseases such as proliferative diabetic retinopathy. We determined that <b>bucillamine,</b> an anti-rheumatic drug, inhibits the VEGF production induced by hypoxia in bovine retinal microcapillary endothelial cells (BREC). To further clarify the inhibitory mechanism, we investigated the possible mechanism by which <b>bucillamine</b> exerts this inhibitory effect. <b>Bucillamine</b> (100 μM) decreased the hypoxia-induced increase of VEGF mRNA by 54. 5 % (P< 0. 001). <b>Bucillamine</b> (100 μM) reduced the hypoxia-induced VEGF content in culture media by 29. 0 % (P< 0. 001), while monosulfydryl drugs, N-acetylcysteine and D-penicillamine, did not. <b>Bucillamine</b> (100 μM) did not affect VEGF mRNA half-life (hypoxia, 4. 3 h; hypoxia+bucillamine, 3. 9 h; normoxia, 2. 7 h; normoxia+bucillamine, 2. 7 h). Reporter gene studies revealed that <b>bucillamine</b> reduced transcriptional activity in the 5 ′-flanking region of the VEGF gene by 74. 0 %. Hypoxia stimulated binding activity of BREC nuclear protein to a hypoxia responsive element (HRE), which was decreased by <b>bucillamine.</b> <b>Bucillamine</b> inhibited hypoxic-induction of HIF- 1 α mRNA by 73. 1 % (P< 0. 001). <b>Bucillamine</b> also inhibited spontaneous VEGF mRNA expression by 26. 6 %. Furthermore, it inhibited activity of VEGF promoter and decreased binding activity to Sp 1 and HRE, but did not alter AP 1 and AP 2 activity in normoxia. These data suggest that <b>bucillamine</b> inhibits hypoxic induction of VEGF through inhibition of HIF- 1 induction and binding activity in BREC. <b>Bucillamine</b> also inhibits the spontaneous expression of VEGF mRNA by its effect on Sp 1 and HRE binding...|$|E

40|$|The <b>bucillamine</b> {{effect on}} free-radical-mediated {{degradation}} of high-molar-mass hyaluronan (HA) has been elucidated. As HA fragmentation {{is expected to}} decrease its dynamic viscosity, rotational viscometry was applied to follow the oxidative HA degradation. Non-isothermal chemiluminometry, thermogravimetry, differential scanning calorimetry, and size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) were applied to characterize resulting HA fragments. Although <b>bucillamine</b> completely inhibited the HA viscosity decrease caused by oxidative system, indicating HA protection from degradation, SEC analysis suggested that some other mechanisms leading to the <b>bucillamine</b> transformations without the decay of the viscosity may come into a play as well.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundLiver {{transplantation}} and resection surgery {{involve a}} period of ischaemia and reperfusion to the liver which initiates an inflammatory cascade resulting in liver and remote organ injury. <b>Bucillamine</b> is a low-molecular-weight thiol antioxidant {{that is capable of}} rapidly entering cells. MethodsThe effect of <b>bucillamine</b> was studied in a rat model of liver ischaemia–reperfusion injury with 45 min of partial (70 %) liver ischaemia and at 3 and 24 h of reperfusion. Controls included ischaemia-reperfusion (I/R) only, sham and <b>bucillamine</b> alone (without ischaemia reperfusion). Liver injury was assessed by serum transaminases (AST and ALT). Sinusoidal blood flow and hepatocyte apoptosis were measured using intravital microscopy (IVM). ResultsThe hepatocellular injury of I/R produced a markedly elevated serum AST which was reduced with <b>bucillamine</b> (2072. 5 ± 511. 79 vs. 932 ± 200. 8, P 0. 001).

40|$|Ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) {{injury is}} a serious {{potential}} threat to outcomes in organ transplantation and other clinical arenas {{in which there is}} temporary interruption of blood flow. I/R is a frequent cause of primary failure in organ transplantation. We hypothesized that the antioxidant <b>bucillamine,</b> a potent sulfhydryl donor, would protect against I/R injury in high-risk organ transplants. Because livers subjected to prolonged ischemia and very fatty livers are highly susceptible to severe I/R injury, we studied the effect of <b>bucillamine</b> in three animal models of liver transplantation: two ex vivo models of isolated perfused livers, either normal or fatty rat livers, and an in vivo model of syngenic orthotopic liver transplants in rats. In all models, livers were deprived of oxygen for 24 h before either ex vivo reperfusion or transplantation. In the ex vivo models, <b>bucillamine</b> treatment significantly improved portal vein blood flow and bile production, preserved normal liver architecture, and significantly reduced liver enzyme release and indices of oxidative stress. Moreover, <b>bucillamine</b> treatment significantly increased levels of reduced glutathione in the liver and lowered levels of oxidized glutathione in both liver and blood. In rats subjected to liver transplants, <b>bucillamine</b> significantly enhanced survival and protected against hepatic injury. Possible mechanisms of this protection include prevention of excessive accumulation of toxic oxygen species, interruption of redox signaling in hepatocytes, and inhibition of macrophage activation. This study demonstrates the potential utility of <b>bucillamine</b> or other cysteine-derived thiol donors for improving outcomes in organ transplantation and other clinical settings involving I/R injury...|$|E
40|$|The {{prolonged}} {{production of}} {{reactive oxygen species}} due to ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is a potential cause of the pathological remodeling that frequently precedes heart failure. We tested {{the ability of a}} potent dithiol antioxidant, <b>bucillamine,</b> to protect against the long-term consequences of I/R injury in a murine model of myocardial infarction. After transiently occluding the left anterior descending coronary artery for 30 min, saline or <b>bucillamine</b> (10 μg/g body wt) was injected intravenously as a bolus within the first 5 min of reperfusion. The antioxidant treatment continued with daily subcutaneous injections for 4 wk. There were no differences in infarct sizes between bucillamine- and saline-treated animals. After 4 wk of reperfusion, cardiac hypertrophy was decreased by <b>bucillamine</b> treatment (ventricular weight-to-body weight ratios: I/R + saline, 4. 5 ± 0. 2 mg/g vs. I/R + <b>bucillamine,</b> 4. 2 ± 0. 1 mg/g; means ± SE; P < 0. 05). Additionally, the hearts of bucillamine-treated mice had improved contractile function (echocardiographic measurement of fractional shortening) relative to saline controls: I/R + saline, 32 ± 3 %, versus I/R + <b>bucillamine,</b> 41 ± 4 % (P < 0. 05). Finally, I/R-induced injury in the saline-treated mice was accompanied by a fetal pattern of gene expression determined by ribonuclease protection assay that was consistent with pathological cardiac hypertrophy and remodeling [increased atrial natriuretic peptide, β-myosin heavy chain (MHC), skeletal α-actin; decreased sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca 2 + ATPase 2 a, and α-MHC-to-β-MHC ratio]. These changes in gene expression were significantly attenuated by <b>bucillamine.</b> Therefore, treatment with a dithiol antioxidant for 4 wk after I/R preserved ventricular function and prevented the abnormal pattern of gene expression associated with pathological cardiac remodeling...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE. <b>Bucillamine</b> is an {{antirheumatic}} drug with antiangiogenic {{properties that}} is currently used in clinical practice.

Thus, the effect of <b>bucillamine</b> on the eyes of rats with experimental CNV was investigated in vivo by subconjunctival injection or oral intake. METHODS. CNV was induced in rat eyes by diode laser photocoagulation. The intensity of fluorescein leakage from the photocoagulated lesions was studied 7 and 14 days after photocoagulation. The areas of CNV lesions were measured histologically and studied immunohistochemically at days 4, 7, and 14.

40|$|We {{reported}} {{a case of}} rheumatoid arthritis complicated by bucillamine-induced nephropathy satisfactorily treated with Kampo (Chinese/Japanese traditional) medicines. The patient was a 56 -year-old male, who suffered from polyarthralgia from December 1996. In February 1997, {{he was diagnosed with}} RA in another hospital and treated with loxoprofen sodium, <b>bucillamine</b> and prednisolone. He visited our hospital in May 1997, and we began to treat him with a combination of modern Western and Kampo medicines. During his clinical course, proteinuria induced by <b>bucillamine</b> developed. After <b>bucillamine</b> was discontinued, his polyarthralgia and inflammatory parameters became worse. However, Kampo formulations, Keishi-bukuryo-gan mixed with Toki-shakuyaku-san and Dai-bofu-to, were effective for reducing the activity of RA. The clinical course of this case suggests that Kampo medicines might be useful for the treatment of RA patients, especially for those who have adverse reaction to disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). 　ブシラミン腎症を併発した慢性関節リウマチ(RA) に対して,漢方治療が奏功した 1 例を報告した。症例は 56 歳,男性。 1996 年 12 月,多関節痛出現。 1997 年 2 月,他院にてRAの診断のもと,ロキソプロフェン,プレドニゾロン,ブシラミンにて加療を受けた。 1997 年 5 月,当科初診以来,現代西洋医学的治療に漢方治療を併用して加療にあたった。経過中,ブシラミンによる蛋白尿が出現。ブシラミンを中止したところ,多関節痛と炎症反応が悪化した。しかし,桂枝茯苓丸合当帰芍薬散および大防風湯が奏功し,RAの活動性が低下し蛋白尿も消失した。このことから,副作用によりDMARDsが使用困難なRAの治療に対して,漢方治療が有効である可能性が示唆された...|$|E

The drug was evaluated in an in vivo lobar liver ischemia reperfusion model as previously described. Male Sprague –Dawley rats were subjected to 45 mins of partial hepatic (70 %) ischaemia followed by 3 hrs of reperfusion to investigate the early phase of hepatic IR and 24 hrs of reperfusion to study the late phase of hepatic IR. Changes to the microcirculation, leucocyte adherence and apoptosis were assessed by intra-vital microscopy. Hepatocellular injury was assessed by standard liver function tests. Expression of pro and antiapoptotic gene expression was studied by RT-PCR. Oxidative stress was assessed by measuring plasma and hepatic F 2 isoprostane levels and tissue glutathione levels. Cytokine response was assessed by measuring serum CINC- 1 levels. <b>Bucillamine</b> improved liver sinusoidal perfusion, reduced leukocyte adherence and apoptosis in both the early and late phases of IR injury. Hepatocellular injury was reduced. There was no difference in the level of tissue glutathione or tissue and plasma F 2 isoprostane levels.

40|$|Vascular endothelial {{growth factor}} (VEGF) {{is a potent}} inducer of {{angiogenesis}} and is constitutively expressed in the synovium of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Over-expression of VEGF may {{play an important role}} in pathogenic vascularization and synovial hyperplasia of RA. In the present study, we examined whether disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including <b>bucillamine</b> (BUC), gold sodium thiomalate (GST), methotrexate (MTX) and salazosulfapiridine (SASP), act by inhibiting the production of VEGF by cultured synovial cells of patients with RA. Treatment of cultured synoviocytes with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) significantly increased VEGF production by cultured synovial cells. BUC significantly inhibited LPS-induced VEGF production, while GST tended to inhibit the production of VEGF. The inhibitory effects on VEGF production were dose-dependent. In contrast, MTX and SASP did not affect VEGF production. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that BUC also inhibited LPS-induced VEGF mRNA expression in RA synovial cells. The present study provides the first evidence that BUC inhibits VEGF production and the expression of its mRNA in synovial cells of RA patients. Our results indicate that the anti-rheumatic effects of BUC are mediated by suppression of angiogenesis and synovial proliferation in the RA synovium through the inhibition of VEGF production by synovial cells...|$|E
40|$|IntroductionThe Japan Renal Biopsy Registry (J-RBR) {{was started}} in 2007 by the Committee for the Standardization of Renal Pathological Diagnosis and the Committee for the Kidney Disease Registry of the Japanese Society of Nephrology. The purpose of this report is to clarify drug-induced kidney disease (DIKD) of renal biopsied cases in Japan. Subjects and methodsWe {{analyzed}} the data of 26, 535 cases that were registered in the J-RBR from 2007 to 2015. ResultsBased on clinical and pathological diagnoses, 328 cases (176 males and 152 females) of renal biopsy-proven DIKD were registered in the J-RBR from 2007 to 2015 (1. 24 % of all cases). The frequency of DIKD increased with age. The number of cases peaked in the 6 th– 8 th decade in all pathological categories, except {{for the number of}} chronic tubulointerstitial lesions (CTIL), which peaked in the 4 th– 5 th decade. Overall, the frequency of DIKD was 3 times higher in the 7 th decade than in the 2 nd decade (1. 86 vs. 0. 62 %). The main clinical diagnoses were DIKD in 150 cases (45. 7 %), nephrotic syndrome in 66 cases (20. 1 %), chronic nephritic syndrome in 55 cases (16. 8 %), and rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in 30 cases (9. 1 %). DIKD was registered as a secondary diagnosis in 136 cases (41. 5 %). The pathological findings of these cases were glomerular lesions in 105 cases (32. 0 %), acute tubulointerstitial lesions (ATIL) in 87 cases (26. 5 %), CTIL in 72 cases (22. 0 %), and sclerotic glomerular lesions and/or nephrosclerosis in 18 cases (5. 5 %). ATIL and CTIL were mainly found in cases in which DIKD was diagnosed {{on the basis of the}} patient’s clinical findings. In addition, nephrotic syndrome-related membranous nephropathy (MN) was the major cause of renal damage in 59. 4 % of the cases involving glomerular injuries. According to the CGA risk classification, high-risk (red zone) cases accounted for 56. 1 % of all cases of DIKD and 75. 9, 64. 9, and 33. 3 % of the cases involving ATIL, CTIL, and glomerular injuries, respectively. The causative drugs were identified in 102 cases, including <b>bucillamine</b> in 38 cases of MN, gemcitabine in 3 cases of thrombotic microangiopathy, and other anticancer drugs in 14 cases (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs in 3 cases and propyl thiouracil in 3 cases of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-related nephritis). ConclusionOur analysis of the J-RBR revealed that DIKD mainly affects elderly people in Japan. ATIL or CTIL were found in approximately half of the biopsied cases of DIKD, and one-third involved glomerular lesions, mainly MN or clinical nephrotic syndrome...|$|E
