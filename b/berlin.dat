5|$|After the <b>Berlin</b> Wall {{was built}} in 1961, Zoologischer Garten became the West <b>Berlin</b> and Ostbahnhof the East <b>Berlin</b> de facto central station. The station Friedrichstraße now was the {{terminal}} point of the separated West and East <b>Berlin</b> S-Bahn lines and departure point for the Interzonenzug (Inter-zone train) services between West <b>Berlin</b> and West Germany. Friedrichstraße station was separated into Eastern and Western parts with steel walls, and enabled West Berliners to change to S-Bahn trains running on the Nord-Süd-Bahn and the U6 line of the <b>Berlin</b> U-Bahn without passing through GDR border controls. The station also featured a border crossing into East <b>Berlin.</b>|$|E
5|$|Prices for the West <b>Berlin</b> S-Bahn {{were kept}} {{slightly}} below the fares of the West <b>Berlin</b> BVG. In East <b>Berlin,</b> a flat fee of 0.20 Mark was charged until 1991. West <b>Berlin</b> politics {{and most of}} the populace fully boycotted the S-Bahn, which was run by the East German railways, and introduced bus and U-Bahn lines running parallel to the S-Bahn network and the Stadtbahn.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Berlin</b> Stadtbahn ("city railway") is a {{major railway}} {{thoroughfare}} in the German capital <b>Berlin,</b> which runs through <b>Berlin</b> from east to west. It connects the eastern district of Friedrichshain with Charlottenburg in the west via 11 intermediate stations including Hauptbahnhof. The <b>Berlin</b> Stadtbahn is often also defined as the slightly longer route between Ostkreuz and Westkreuz, although this is not technically correct.|$|E
5|$|A panel {{very similar}} in {{description}} {{was purchased by}} the Aachen art collector Barthold Suermondt sometime during the 1860s and catalogued in 1869 with a detailing of the frame's inscription. This work was thought {{to have come from}} Nantes, suggesting it was the same as the panel mentioned in 1851. The Suermondt collection was acquired by the <b>Berlin</b> museum in May 1874, as part of an acquisition of 219 paintings. The painting was stolen in March 1877, generating worldwide news coverage; it was recovered ten days later, but without the original frame. The 1875 <b>Berlin</b> museum catalogue attributes a van Eyck imitator; the 1883 catalogue describes the original as lost and the <b>Berlin</b> painting a copy. Soon after, however, its authenticity was verified, and the 1904 <b>Berlin</b> catalogue attributed Jan.|$|E
5|$|After the {{construction}} of the <b>Berlin</b> Wall in August 1961, the Seventh Army began sending infantry units from the divisions in West Germany on a rotating basis to reinforce the <b>Berlin</b> Brigade. The 24th Division's units participated in this action.|$|E

5|$|<b>Berlin</b> {{was among}} the six light cruisers Germany was {{permitted}} to retain by the Treaty of Versailles. In {{the service of the}} newly reorganized Reichsmarine, <b>Berlin</b> served as a training cruiser, starting in 1922. That year, Wilhelm Canaris was assigned to the ship, which went to Norway in November 1923. In January 1924, <b>Berlin</b> departed German waters for an extended overseas cruise, which was the first time a German warship had done so since the end of World War I. While on the cruise, Canaris met a naval cadet by the name of Reinhard Heydrich, who {{went on to become a}} close friend and eventual architect of The Holocaust. In 1928, <b>Berlin</b> conducted a training cruise around the world, which included a stop in Fremantle. Training duties lasted until 1929, when she was withdrawn from service. Starting in 1935, the Kriegsmarine used <b>Berlin</b> as a barracks ship in Kiel. There, she survived World War II; in the aftermath of the war, she was loaded with chemical weapons and scuttled in the Skaggerak to dispose of them, on 31 May 1947.|$|E

5|$|By 23 April the Red Army had {{surrounded}} <b>Berlin,</b> and Goebbels made a proclamation urging {{its citizens}} {{to defend the}} city. That same day, Göring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden, arguing that since Hitler was isolated in <b>Berlin,</b> Göring should assume leadership of Germany. Göring set a deadline, after which he would consider Hitler incapacitated. Hitler responded by having Göring arrested, and in his last will and testament, written on 29 April, he removed Göring from all government positions. On 28 April Hitler discovered that Himmler, who had left <b>Berlin</b> on 20 April, was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies. He ordered Himmler's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein (Himmler's SS representative at Hitler's HQ in <b>Berlin)</b> shot.|$|E
5|$|By early 1945, Germany's {{military}} {{situation was}} on the verge of total collapse. Hitler, presiding over a rapidly disintegrating Third Reich, retreated to his Führerbunker in <b>Berlin</b> on 16 January 1945. To the Nazi leadership, it was clear that the battle for <b>Berlin</b> would be the final battle of the war. <b>Berlin</b> was bombarded by Soviet artillery for the first time on 20 April 1945 (Hitler's birthday). By the evening of 21 April, Red Army tanks reached the outskirts of the city. By 27 April, <b>Berlin</b> was cut off from the rest of Germany.|$|E

5|$|Due to a quirk in legislation, the West <b>Berlin</b> {{parts of}} the Stadtbahn belonged to the Deutsche Reichsbahn, which made it (and {{therefore}} the GDR government) {{one of the largest}} landowners in West <b>Berlin.</b> Regular quarrels erupted between the DR, the GDR government, the West <b>Berlin</b> Senate and the Allied occupation powers.|$|E
5|$|Following US 30, Route 73 {{passes through}} a small corner of <b>Berlin</b> Boro before it goes under New Jersey Transit’s Atlantic City Line near the Atco station. At the {{railroad}} crossing, the route enters <b>Berlin</b> Township and meets CR 534 at a crossroad. After the intersection with this route, the road proceeds back into <b>Berlin</b> Boro, where the route runs through a mix of residences and businesses. Route 73 widens to a six-lane highway and comes to the former <b>Berlin</b> Circle, where it meets both CR 689 and CR 708. From here, the road turns north and reenters <b>Berlin</b> Township as a four-lane divided highway, continuing through developed areas and intersecting CR 692.

5|$|However, in <b>Berlin</b> Meyerbeer faced many problems, {{including}} the enmity of the jealous Gaspare Spontini, who since 1820 had been Court Kapellmeister {{and director of}} the <b>Berlin</b> Hofoper. Complaints were made in the <b>Berlin</b> press about the delay of the <b>Berlin</b> premiere of Robert le diable (which finally took place in June 1832), and Meyerbeer's music was decried by the critic and poet Ludwig Rellstab. There was no sign of the German opera expected from Meyerbeer. Moreover, reactionary censorship laws prevented production of Les Huguenots in <b>Berlin,</b> (and indeed in many other cities of Germany). Nevertheless, Meyerbeer, who (as he wrote to a friend) 'years ago...swore to myself never to respond personally to attacks on my work, and never under any circumstances to cause or respond to personal polemics', refused to be drawn on any of these matters.|$|E
