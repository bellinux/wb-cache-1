In the UK courts, on 21 March 2011, Paul Allen, a trustee of the Jacobs estate, was ordered to pay as security to the court 65% of the costs faced by Bloomsbury and Rowling, amounting to over £1.5million, to avoid the claim being struck out. It was reported in The Bookseller that Paul Allen has appealed against paying this sum. As a condition of the appeal, he paid £50,000 to the court in May 2011. The claim was formally struck out in July 2011 after the deadline for Allen's initial payment was missed.|$|E

25|$|The psalter {{is written}} in Church Slavonic of the Serbian recension, the medieval {{literary}} language of the Serbs. The book's text contains no vernacular or dialectal traces, as {{can be found in}} some Serbian manuscripts. The Cyrillic orthography used in the psalter mostly adheres to the norms of the Resava literary school, which developed {{in the last quarter of}} the 14th century and the first decades of the 15th century. The Resava orthography became dominant in Serbian literature, but it never fully ousted the rules of the older Raška literary school. The usage of the Raška orthography in the Goražde Psalter is comparable with that in the Crnojević Psalter published in Cetinje in 1495, though there are also notable differences <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>books.</b> The former uses both yers, ъ and ь, as prescribed by the Resava school, while the latter uses only ь.|$|E
500|$|A satirical and parodic {{precursor}} of Candide, Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels (1726) {{is one of}} Candides closest literary relatives. This satire {{tells the story of}} [...] "a gullible ingenue", Gulliver, who (like Candide) travels to several [...] "remote nations" [...] and is hardened by the many misfortunes which befall him. As evidenced by similarities <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>books,</b> Voltaire probably drew upon Gulliver's Travels for inspiration while writing Candide. Other probable sources of inspiration for Candide are Télémaque (1699) by François Fénelon and Cosmopolite (1753) by Louis-Charles Fougeret de Monbron. Candides parody of the bildungsroman is probably based on Télémaque, which includes the prototypical parody of the sagacious tutor on whom Pangloss may have been partly based. Likewise, Monbron's protagonist undergoes a disillusioning series of travels similar to those of Candide.|$|E
500|$|William Golding's 1954 novel Lord of the Flies {{was written}} as a {{counterpoint}} to (or even a parody of) The Coral Island, and Golding makes explicit references to it. At {{the end of}} the novel, for instance, one of the naval officers who rescues the children mentions the book, commenting on the hunt for one of their number, Ralph, as a [...] "jolly good show. Like the Coral Island". Jack also makes an appearance in Lord of the Flies as Jack Merridew, representing the irrational nature of the boys. Indeed, Golding's three central characters– Ralph, Piggy and Jack– are caricatures of Ballantyne's heroes. Despite having enjoyed The Coral Island many times as a child, Golding strongly disagreed with the views that it espoused, and in contrast Lord of the Flies depicts the English boys as savages themselves, who forget more than they learn, unlike Ballantyne's boys. Golding described the relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>books</b> by saying that The Coral Island [...] "rotted to compost" [...] in his mind, and in the compost [...] "a new myth put down roots". Neither is the idyllic nature of Ballantyne's coral island to be found on Stevenson's treasure island, which is unsuitable for settlement [...] "but exists merely as a site from which to excavate treasure, a view consistent with the late-Victorian imperial mission" [...] according to Honaker.|$|E

2500|$|While {{the book}} was billed as {{leading up to the}} {{beginning}} of DC's Final Crisis limited series, it later emerged that the plotlines in Countdown had diverged from what was written for Final Crisis, leading to continuity problems <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>books,</b> as noted by Final Crisis author Grant Morrison.

2500|$|For several years, Cowdery and {{his family}} {{attended}} the Congregational Church in Poultney, Vermont when its minister was the Rev.

In 2000, David Persuitte argued that Cowdery's knowledge of View of the Hebrews significantly contributed to {{the final version of}} the Book of Mormon, a connection first suggested as early as 1902.

2500|$|Although Roberts {{continued}} {{to testify to}} the truth of the Book of Mormon, a foundational work of Mormonism, he also wrote three studies, unpublished until 1985, that wrestled with Book of Mormon problems.

Grant. When Roberts confessed that he had no answer for some of the difficulties, and the general authorities chose to ignore them , Roberts produced [...] "A Book of Mormon Study," [...] a treatise of more than 400 pages. In this work he compared the Book of Mormon to the earlier-published View of the Hebrews, written by Ethan Smith, and found significant similarities between them. Finally, Roberts wrote [...] "A Parallel," [...] a condensed version of his larger study, which demonstrated eighteen points of similarity <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>books,</b> and in which he reflected that the imaginative Joseph Smith might have written the Book of Mormon without divine assistance.|$|E

2500|$|Both Tom Brown's Schooldays and Harry Potter involve {{an average}} eleven-year-old, better at sport than {{academic}} study, who {{is sent to}} boarding school.

6000|$|There is {{not much}} {{similarity}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>books,</b> yet when recalling Emily Bronte my thoughts always run on to Olive Schreiner. Here, again, {{was a young girl}} with the voice of a strong man. Olive Schreiner, more fortunate, has lived; but I doubt if she will ever write a book that will remind us of her first. [...] "The Story of an African Farm" [...] is not a work to be repeated. We have advanced in literature of late. I can well remember the storm of indignation with which the [...] "African Farm" [...] was received by Mrs. Grundy and her then numerous, but now happily diminishing, school. It was a book that was to be kept from the hands of every young man and woman. But the hands of the young men and women stretched out and grasped it, to their help. It is a curious idea, this of Mrs. Grundy's, that the young man and woman must never think--that all literature that does anything more than echo the conventions must be hidden away.|$|E
6000|$|Another {{point of}} {{resemblance}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two</b> <b>books</b> {{might be found}} in the fact that they both contain the sketch of the same kind of eighteenth-century aristocrat, if indeed that kind of aristocrat really existed in the eighteenth century. The diabolical dandy with the rapier and the sneer is at any rate a necessity of all normal plays and romances; hence Mr. Chester has a right to exist in this romance, and Foulon a right to exist in a page of history almost as cloudy and disputable as a romance. What Dickens and other romancers do probably omit from the picture of the eighteenth-century oligarch is probably his liberality. It must never be forgotten that even when he was a despot in practice he was generally a liberal in theory. Dickens and romancers make the pre-revolution tyrant a sincere believer in tyranny; generally he was not. He was a sceptic about everything, even about his own position. The romantic Foulon says of the people, [...] "Let them eat grass," [...] with bitter and deliberate contempt. The real Foulon (if he ever said it at all) probably said it as a sort of dreary joke because he couldn't think of any other way out of the problem. Similarly Mr. Chester, a cynic as he is, believes seriously in the beauty of being a gentleman; a real man of that type probably disbelieved in that as in everything else. Dickens was too bracing, one may say too bouncing himself to understand the psychology of fatigue in a protected and leisured class. He could understand a tyrant like Quilp, a tyrant who is on his throne because he has climbed up into it, like a monkey. He could not understand a tyrant who is on his throne because he is too weary to get out of it. The old aristocrats were in a dead way quite good-natured. They were even humanitarians; which perhaps accounts for {{the extent to which they}} roused against themselves the healthy hatred of humanity. But they were tired humanitarians; tired with doing nothing. Figures like that of Mr. Chester, therefore, fail somewhat to give the true sense of something hopeless and helpless which led men to despair of the upper class. He has a boyish pleasure in play-acting; he has an interest in life; being a villain is his hobby. But the true man of that type had found all hobbies fail him. He had wearied of himself as he had wearied of a hundred women. He was graceful and could not even admire himself in the glass. He was witty and could not even laugh at his own jokes. Dickens could never understand tedium.|$|E

40|$|This book offers {{unique and}} {{valuable}} {{contributions to the}} field. It offers breadth and inclusiveness. Most existing works on automotive painting cover only a single aspect of this complex topic, such as the chemistry of paint or paint booth technology. Monozukuri and Hitozukuri are Japanese terms that can be translated as “making things” and “developing people” but their implications in Japanese are richer and more complex than this minimal translation would indicate. The Monozukuri-Hitozukuri perspective is drawn from essential principles on which the Toyota approach to problem-solving and continuous improvement is based. From this perspective, neither painting technology R&D nor painting technology use in manufacturing can be done successfully without integrating technological and human concerns involved with making and learning in the broadest sense, as the hyphen is meant to indicate. The editors provide case studies and examples [...] drawn from Mr. Toda’s 33 years of experience with automotive painting at Toyota and from Dr. Saito’s 18 years experience with IR 4 TD, the research-for-development group he leads at the University of Kentucky [...] that give details on how these two principles can be integrated for successful problem-solving and innovation in industry, in university R&D, and in <b>the</b> collaboration <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>two.</b> <b>The</b> <b>book</b> will bring readers {{up to date on}} progress in the field over the last decade to provide a basis for and to indicate fruitful directions in future R&D and technology innovation for automotive painting...|$|R
