5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E
25|$|Indeed, it's {{clearly in}} the {{interest}} of Africa to play one side against the other, and to avoid alliances between China and the West, which might work to decrease raw material prices. Legal power remains in the hands of local African elites, {{who may or may not}} decide to enforce laws which would tighten control of resources, or further exploit them. Pursuing democracy and transparency is no longer the sole model; development is, for sure, and as long as African leaders can provide it, their power will <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> assured.|$|E
500|$|After {{enduring}} {{three years}} of [...] "carping" [...] from critics, Carey planned her return to music. On November 18, 2004, she revealed on her website that {{the name of the}} album would be The Emancipation of Mimi. While Carey was recording the album, Island Records executive L.A. Reid had learned that close friends referred to the singer as [...] "Mimi". He had told Carey, [...] "I feel your spirit on this record. You should use that name in the title, because that's the fun side of you that people don't get to see – the side that can laugh at the diva jokes, laugh at the breakdown jokes, laugh at whatever they want to say about you and just live life and enjoy it." [...] Carey explained that Mimi is a [...] "very personal nickname" [...] only used by those in her inner circle, and thus the title meant she was letting her guard down and inviting her fans to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> closer to her. She thought that naming her album The Emancipation of Mariah Carey would be [...] "obnoxious".|$|E
50|$|A major {{difference}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> more {{information can be}} conveyed in 140 Chinese characters than the 140 Latin alphabet characters used on Twitter for many languages.|$|R
50|$|Another {{criticism}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of {{the information}} is reliant on the institutions faithfulness; People and Planet {{did not have the}} resources to mount an independent audit.|$|R

500|$|The episode {{introduces}} two new {{characters to}} the series, portrayed by Aaron Munoz (Tony) and Michael Raymond-James (Dave). Although {{they were killed}} off in the episode, writer Robert Kirkman wanted to evoke a reaction that the characters would recur throughout the series. [...] "With the casting of those two guys and everything involving that scene we were really {{trying to convince the}} audience {{that they were going to}} be new regulars, so the end would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> more shocking." [...] Kirkman felt that Tony and Dave represent new threats and anxieties for the group. [...] "I think this was a particularly good episode coming back because the two guys in the bar represent new threats and they are really just the tip of the iceberg," [...] he stated. [...] "It's really good to come back and be off of the farm and see that there are more dangerous things out there than the zombies. Things just keep getting worse from here.". [...] "The Regulator" [...] by Clutch was the song used as the closing title sequence.|$|E
2500|$|Vance and Frawley's {{off-screen}} {{relationship was}} less successful. In spite of this, {{they were always}} professional and exhibited exceptional chemistry while performing on the show. In fact, their acrimonious personal relationship may have helped their onscreen marriage <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> funnier. Frawley derisively described Vance's appearance as [...] "a sack of doorknobs." [...] It was reported that Vance, who was 22 years younger than Frawley, was not really keen {{on the idea that}} her character Ethel was married to a man that was old enough to be her father. Vance also complained that Frawley's song-and-dance skills were not what they once were. Frawley and Vance would have an adversarial relationship during the entire run of the show.|$|E
2500|$|When Harry Manfredini {{began working}} on the musical score, the {{decision}} was made to only play music when the killer was actually present so as to not [...] "manipulate the audience". Manfredini pointed out the lack of music for certain scenes: [...] "There's a scene where one of the girls... is setting up the archery area... One of the guys shoots an arrow into the target and just misses her. It's a huge scare, but if you notice, there's no music. That was a choice." [...] Manfredini also noted that when something was going to happen, the music would cut off so that the audience would relax a bit, and the scare would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> more effective.|$|E
50|$|Again {{and again}} Liger sees new {{recruits}} and troop replacements die and he <b>is</b> angry <b>that</b> {{they do not}} seemingly receive enough training. Some die -during training, which <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> more frustrating.|$|R

60|$|Three hundred a year certain, anyhow! It was an {{enormous}} income to me. For a moment I was altogether staggered. Could there <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> money in the whole concern?

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Mr. Glegg, who {{had been}} meditating after Tom's words, [...] "we shouldn't be doing any wrong by the creditors, supposing your father was bankrupt. I've been {{thinking}} o' that, for I've been a creditor myself, and seen no end o' cheating. If he meant to give your aunt the money before ever he got into this sad work o' lawing, it's the same as if he'd made away with the note himself; for he'd {{made up his mind}} to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> poorer. But there's a deal o' things to be considered, young man," [...] Mr. Glegg added, looking admonishingly at Tom, [...] "when you come to money business, and you may be taking one man's dinner away to make another man's breakfast. You don't understand that, I doubt?" ...|$|E
50|$|The other eight {{residential}} complexes {{were later}} built much tighter, so there <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> less space for green areas. This was {{largely due to}} the housing programme of the GDR. The need for housing was great.|$|R

50|$|Said otherwise, {{large groups}} close to {{two-thirds of the}} {{population}} {{will be more likely}} than any other groups to dissolve into splinter groups. A corollary of this consideration <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> smaller groups will be the ones most likely to emerge and to persist.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have already}} called your {{attention}} in my circulars," [...] resumed the speaker, [...] "to {{the fact that}} advertising signs {{are the source of}} large income to the farmers of this district. I find that three thousand, seven hundred and eighty-three dollars have been paid the farmers in the last five years, without the least trouble or expense on their part; and this handsome sum of money belongs to them and should not be taken away. Stop and think for a moment. Advertising is the life of every business, and to fight successfully the great army of advertisers whose business is the life-blood of our institutions is as impossible as it is absurd. Suppose every farmer in this district refused to permit signs upon his property; what would be the result? Why, the farmers of other sections would get that much more money for letting privileges, and you would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> out of pocket without suppressing the evil--if evil can attach to an industry that pays you good money without requiring either investment or labor in return." ...|$|E
60|$|Direct Generals Warren and Wright to {{withdraw}} all their teams and artillery, not in position, {{to the north}} side of the river to-morrow. Send that belonging to General Wright's corps as far on the road to Hanover Town as it can go, without attracting attention to the fact. Send with it Wright's best division or division under his ablest commander. Have their places filled up in the line so if possible the enemy will not notice their withdrawal. Send the cavalry to-morrow afternoon, or as much of it as you may deem necessary, to watch and seize, if they can, Littlepage's Bridge and Taylor's Ford, and to remain on one or other side of the river at these points until the infantry and artillery all pass. As soon as it is dark to-morrow night start the division which you withdraw first from Wright's corps to make a forced march to Hanover Town, taking with them no teams to impede their march. At the same time this division starts commence withdrawing all of the 5th and 6th corps from the south side of the river, and march them for the same place. The two divisions of the 9th corps not now with Hancock, may be moved down the north bank of the river where they will be handy to support Hancock if necessary, or will <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> on their road to follow the 5th and 6th corps. Hancock should hold his command in readiness to follow as soon as the way is clear for him. To-morrow it will leave nothing for him to do, but as soon as he can he should get all his teams and spare artillery on the road or roads which he will have to take. As soon as the troops reach Hanover Town they should get possession of all the crossings they can in that neighborhood. I think it would be well to make a heavy cavalry demonstration on the enemy's left, to-morrow afternoon, also.|$|E

5000|$|A major {{difficulty}} in [...] "going paperless" [...] <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> of a business's communication is with other businesses and individuals, {{as opposed to}} just being internal.

50|$|Being {{first into}} a market carries {{considerable}} risks. On the other hand, the first brand {{is likely to}} gain a major, leading and on-going, share of that market in the long term.
