5|$|The Austrian Netherlands was a {{territory}} with its capital at Brussels which covered {{much of what}} is today <b>Belgium</b> <b>and</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> during the Early Modern period. In 1714, the territory, which had been ruled by Spain, was ceded to Austria as part of the Treaty of Rastatt which ended the War of the Spanish Succession. In the 1580s, the Dutch Revolt had separated the independent Dutch Republic {{from the rest of the}} territory, leaving the Austrian Netherlands with a staunchly Catholic population. The clergy maintained substantial power.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pacts, the Soviet Union's fears continued. In {{a stance}} long held by Russian {{military}} theorists, {{control of the}} Baltic Sea was crucial {{to the defense of}} St. Petersburg, Russia's second-largest city and the Baltic states offered a buffer zone between Russia and Germany. Pursuing this strategy, the Soviet Union initiated the Winter War in Finland after that country rejected a similar Moscow-offered mutual assistance treaty. Stalin was unnerved by German successes in Europe, since they had taken Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, <b>Belgium,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> by spring of 1940. According to Nikita Khrushchev, after the fall of France in May, Joseph Stalin expressed the concern that Adolf Hitler would 'beat our brains in'.|$|E

In Asia, frog legs are consumed in China, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. Chinese edible frog and pig frogs are farmed and consumed on a large scale in some areas of China. Frog legs are part of Chinese Sichuan and Cantonese cuisine. In Indonesia, frog-leg soup is known as swikee or swike.

5|$|The end of Austrian {{dominance}} of the German states shifted Austria's attention to the Balkans. In 1867, the Austrian emperor Franz Joseph accepted a settlement (the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867) in which he gave his Hungarian holdings equal status with his Austrian domains, creating the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The Peace of Prague (1866) offered lenient terms to Austria, in which Austria's relationship with the new nation-state of Italy underwent major restructuring; although the Austrians were far more successful in the military field against Italian troops, the monarchy lost the important province of Venetia. The Habsburgs ceded Venetia to France, which then formally transferred control to Italy. The French public resented the Prussian victory and demanded Revanche pour Sadová ("Revenge for Sadova"), illustrating anti-Prussian sentiment in France—a problem that would accelerate {{in the months leading}} up to the Franco-Prussian War. The Austro-Prussian War also damaged relations with the French government. At a meeting in Biarritz in September 1865 with Napoleon III, Bismarck had let it be understood (or Napoleon had thought he understood) that France might annex parts of <b>Belgium</b> <b>and</b> <b>Luxembourg</b> in exchange for its neutrality in the war. These annexations did not happen, resulting in animosity from Napoleon towards Bismarck.|$|E
