5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl Popper would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> God exists or the <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> God does not exist.|$|E

5|$|Many, if not all, {{countries}} have {{some degree of}} polyethnicity, with countries like the United States and Canada having large levels and countries like Japan and Poland having very small levels (and more specifically, a sense of homogeneity). The amount of polyethnicity prevalent in some Western countries has spurred some arguments against it, which include a <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> it leads to the weakening of each society's strengths, and also a <b>belief</b> <b>that</b> political-ethnic issues in countries with polyethnic populations are better handled with different laws for certain ethnicities.|$|E

Pliny said the same about the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely {{another name for the}} elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.|$|E

40|$|Adult {{reasoning}} {{has been}} shown as mediated by the inhibition of intuitive <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> are in conflict with logic. The current study introduces a classic procedure from the memory field to investigate belief inhibition in 12 - to 17 -year-old reasoners. A lexical decision task was used to probe the memory accessibility of <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> were cued during thinking on syllogistic reasoning problems. Results indicated an impaired memory access for words associated with misleading <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> were cued during reasoning if syllogisms had been solved correctly. This finding supports the claim that even for younger reasoners, correct reasoning is mediated by inhibitory processing as soon as intuitive beliefs conflict with logical considerations. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Keith DeRose’s {{solution}} to the skeptical problem is based on his indirect sensitivity account. Sensitivity is not {{a necessary condition for}} any kind of knowledge, as direct sensitivity accounts claim, but the insensitivity of our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false explains why we tend to judge that we do not know them. The orthodox objection line against any kind of sensitivity account of knowledge is to present instances of insensitive <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> we still judge to constitute knowledge. This objection line offers counter-examples against the claim of direct sensitivity accounts that sensitivity is necessary for any kind of knowledge. These examples raise an easy problem for indirect sensitivity accounts that claim that there is only a tendency to judge <b>that</b> insensitive <b>beliefs</b> do not constitute knowledge, which still applies to our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false. However, a careful analysis reveals that some of our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false are sensitive; nevertheless, we still judge that we do not know them. Therefore, {{the fact that some of}} our <b>beliefs</b> <b>that</b> the skeptical hypotheses are false are insensitive cannot explain why we tend to judge that we do not know them. Hence, indirect sensitivity accounts cannot fulfill their purpose of explaining our intuitions about skepticism. This is the hard problem for indirect sensitivity account...|$|R
