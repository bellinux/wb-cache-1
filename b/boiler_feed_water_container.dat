50|$|Industrial {{cogeneration}} plants normally {{operate at}} much lower boiler pressures than utilities. Among the reasons are: 1) Cogeneration plants face possible contamination of returned condensate. Because <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> from cogeneration plants has much lower return rates than 100% condensing power plants, industries usually {{have to treat}} proportionately more boiler make up <b>water.</b> <b>Boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> must be completely oxygen free and de-mineralized, and the higher the pressure the more critical the level of purity of the <b>feed</b> <b>water.</b> 2) Utilities are typically larger scale power than industry, which helps offset the higher capital costs of high pressure. 3) Utilities {{are less likely to}} have sharp load swings than industrial operations, which deal with shutting down or starting up units that may represent a significant percent of either steam or power demand.|$|R

40|$|Proper {{treatment}} of <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> {{is an important}} part of operating and maintaining a boiler system. As steam is produced, dissolved solids become concentrated and form deposits inside the boiler. This leads to poor heat transfer and reduces the efficiency of the boiler. Dissolved gasses such as oxygen and carbon dioxide will react with the metals in the boiler system and lead to boiler corrosion. In order to protect the boiler from these contaminates, they should be controlled or removed. There are several different technologies that are widely used in the industry for removing these contaminants. Dissolved solids can be removed with reverse osmosis membrane and ion exchange systems. Dissolved gasses have historically been removed using forced draft degasifiers, chemical agents and steam deareators Recently Membrane Contactors have been utilized to remove the dissolved gasses in <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water.</b> Membrane Contactors are widely used in the semiconductor, power, pharmaceutical and other industries to control dissolved gasses in water systems. Their use in <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> degasification systems has grown steadily since the development of new industrial grade devices. Membrane Contactors are constructed using microporous hydrophobic membranes. The membrane is used to bring a gas and liquid in direct contact without mixing. Contactors operate by lowering the pressure of gas in contact with the liquid to create a driving force to remove the dissolved gasses from the water. They are highly efficient, compact and can be used inline under pressure...|$|R

A failure investigation of a welded waste heat boiler steel shell that developed transverse cracks {{was carried out in}} 1996 {{to determine the}} cause of failure as well as propose measures to be adopted to prevent similar failures occurring in the future. The boiler had been in service for several years before two cracks across two traversing circumferential welds were discovered on the underside during routine inspection. Chemical and metallographic analyses indicated that the boiler plate was made from a conventional C-Mn steel and that it was certainly suitable forthe purpose. The boiler interior showed massive deposition of a calcareous sludge on the walls and tube bundles. This was attributed to an excessive use of sodium orthophosphate to reduce the hardness of the <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water.</b> The high levels of Na+and P 043 ions found in both the sludge and <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>water</b> analyses were taken as confirmatory evidence. <b>Feed</b> <b>water</b> quality monitored data forthe period January 1994 to October 1995 showed pH values that were in excess of 12. 4, a figure much higher than the recommended pH range of 8 to 11.

The days of being satisfied with only simple hot product to cold feed exchange, restricted to the plot boundaries of each unit, are a thing of the past. This paper presents results of a refinery-wide survey to identify potential high temperature heat sources that are not being recovered and low temperature systems that consume fuel. The best candidates in each category were connected by a circulating heat medium loop where waste heat is recovered for useful purposes. The heat medium chosen is turbine fuel. It is pumped around the refinery to pick up heat at the crude distilling unit, the hydrocracker, the catalytic cracker, and the coker; the heat is used to reboil a butylenes splitter column and to preheat <b>boiler</b> <b>feed</b> <b>Water.</b> The heat that is recovered is equivalent to some 660 B/D of fuel: at an illustrative fuel value of say $ 30 per barrel, the value of the recovered heat is $ 20, 000 per day.

The DMBA solution for the color development was prepared by dissolving it in diluted hydrochloric acid without using any organic solvents such as alcohols.

The solution was easily prepared with hydrochloric acid and water, stable for longer times and did not evolve when the solution was mixed with sample solutions, and the waste treatment was easier than for the alcoholic solution. A carrier (H(2) O) and the reagent solution were propelled at flow rates of 1. 0 ml min(- 1) and 0. 6 ml min(- 1), respectively. They were merged to flow into a reaction coil (0. 6 mm i. d. × 6 m) kept in a temperature-controlled air bath at 80 ℃.
