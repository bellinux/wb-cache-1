40|$|Although acute lung injury {{contributes}} {{significantly to}} critical illness, resolution often occurs spontaneously via activation of incompletely understood pathways. We recently found that mechanical ventilation of mice increases {{the level of}} pulmonary adenosine, and that mice deficient for extracellular adenosine generation show increased pulmonary edema and inflammation after ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI). Here, we profiled the response to VILI in mice with genetic deletions {{of each of the}} 4 adenosine receptors (ARs) and found that deletion of the A 2 BAR gene was specifically associated with reduced survival time and increased pulmonary albumin leakage after injury. In WT mice, treatment with an A 2 BAR-selective antagonist resulted in enhanced pulmonary inflammation, edema, and attenuated gas exchange, while an A 2 BAR agonist attenuated VILI. In bone marrow–chimeric A 2 BAR mice, although the pulmonary inflammatory response involved A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> from bone marrow–derived cells, A 2 BARs located on the lung tissue attenuated VILI-induced albumin leakage and pulmonary edema. Furthermore, measurement of alveolar fluid clearance (AFC) demonstrated that A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> enhanced amiloride-sensitive fluid transport and elevation of pulmonary cAMP levels following VILI, suggesting that A 2 BAR agonist treatment protects by drying out the lungs. Similar enhancement of pulmonary cAMP and AFC were also observed after β-adrenergic stimulation, a pathway known to promote AFC. Taken together, these studies reveal a role for A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in attenuating VILI and implicate this receptor as a potential therapeutic target during acute lung injury...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Color <b>bar</b> <b>signal</b> {{generator}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important measurements for PAL TV applications. However, its use in resource constrained applications such as color TV video adjustment is limited because of the high architecture complexity involved.

In this paper, we present the design and implementation of a color <b>bar</b> <b>signal</b> generator based on FPGA and MC 1377 with a high performance and low system complexity. The FPGA technology proved to be a proper platform to meet these two contrasting requirements.

40|$|Obesity is a {{significant}} health care problem, affecting more than {{one third of the}} United States population and is an important risk factor for Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T 2 D). Adipose tissue expansion results in the recruitment and accumulation of macrophages, which secrete proinflammatory cytokines that impair insulin signaling. Adenosine regulates inflammation by signaling through G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), such as the A 2 b adenosine receptor (A 2 bAR). Recently a role for adenosine receptors has been described in the differentiation of osteoblasts and adipocytes. This thesis tests the hypothesis that the A 2 bAR regulates adipose tissue dynamics at the level of preadipocyte differentiation and macrophage inflammation. This thesis showed that activation of the A 2 bAR inhibited preadipocyte differentiation. A 2 bAR-induced adipocyte inhibition was dependent on the expression of Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF 4), which is important for stem cell maintenance and renewal. A 2 bAR knockdown enhanced adipogenesis in vitro and A 2 bAR knockout (KO) mice had more adipocytes as compared to wild type (WT) mice, suggesting enhanced adipogenesis {{in the absence of the}} A 2 bAR. The translational potential of this work is strengthened by the previous finding of elevated A 2 bAR expression in adipose tissue of obese individuals as well as our new finding of a close correlation between the expression of A 2 bAR and KLF 4 in adipose tissue of obese individuals. A 2 bAR KO mice have impaired insulin resistance, in part due to reduced levels of insulin receptor substrate- 2 (IRS- 2). Proinflammatory cytokines have been shown to reduce IRS- 2 levels. Given the role of the A 2 bAR in regulating inflammation, the contribution of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in macrophages to insulin resistance was elucidated. Transgenic mice that express A 2 bAR only in macrophages were generated. Intriguingly, restoration of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in macrophages ameliorated insulin resistance, glucose tolerance, and fat and liver tissue insulin signaling. As expected, tissue and plasma proinflammatory cytokine levels were reduced to that of WT mice. This suggested that the protective effect of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> on insulin resistance was due in large part to A 2 bAR control of macrophage cytokine expression. This thesis highlights the importance of A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in adipogenesis and in regulating inflammation in the setting of obesity and T 2 D...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSince its {{discovery}} as a low-affinity adenosine receptor (AR), the A 2 B receptor (A 2 BAR), {{has proven}} enigmatic in its function. The previous {{discovery of the}} A 2 AAR, which shares many similarities with the A 2 BAR but demonstrates significantly greater affinity for its endogenous ligand, led to the original perception that the A 2 BAR was not of substantial physiologic relevance. In addition, lack of specific pharmacological agents targeting the A 2 BAR made its initial characterization challenging. However, {{the importance of this}} receptor was reconsidered when it was observed that the A 2 BAR is highly transcriptionally regulated by factors implicated in inflammatory hypoxia. Moreover, the notion that during ischemia or inflammation extracellular adenosine is dramatically elevated to levels sufficient for A 2 BAR activation, indicated that A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> may be important to dampen inflammation particularly during tissue hypoxia. In addition, the recent advent of techniques for murine genetic manipulation along with development of pharmacological agents with enhanced A 2 BAR specificity has provided invaluable tools for focused studies on the explicit role of A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> in different disease models. Currently, studies performed with combined genetic and pharmacological approaches have demonstrated that A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> plays a tissue protective role in many models of acute diseases e. g. myocardial ischemia, or acute lung injury. These studies indicate that the A 2 BAR is expressed {{on a wide variety of}} cell types and exerts tissue/cell specific effects. This is an important consideration for future studies where tissue or cell type specific targeting of the A 2 BAR may be used as therapeutic approach.

40|$|The {{quality control}} (QC) theory of aging {{is based on}} the concept that aging {{is the result of a}} {{reduction}} in QC of cellular systems designed to maintain lifelong homeostasis. Four QC systems associated with aging are 1) inadequate protein processing in a distressed endoplasmic reticulum (ER); 2) histone deacetylase (HDAC) processing of genomic histones and gene silencing; 3) suppressed AMPK nutrient sensing with inefficient energy utilization and excessive fat accumulation; and 4) beta-adrenergic receptor (<b>BAR)</b> <b>signaling</b> and environmental and emotional stress. Reprogramming these systems to maintain efficiency and prevent aging would be a rational strategy for increased lifespan and improved health. The QC theory can be tested with a pharmacological approach using three well-known and safe, FDA-approved drugs: 1) phenyl butyric acid, a chemical chaperone that enhances ER function and is also an HDAC inhibitor, 2) metformin, which activates AMPK and is used to treat type 2 diabetes, and 3) propranolol, a beta blocker which inhibits <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> and is used to treat hypertension and anxiety. A critical aspect of the QC theory, then, is that aging is associated with multiple cellular systems that can be targeted with drug combinations more effectively than with single drugs. But more importantly, these drug combinations will effectively prevent, delay, or reverse chronic diseases of aging that impose such a tremendous health burden on our society...|$|R

40|$|The α 2 {{adrenergic}} receptor (AR) subtypes {{are important for}} blood pressure control. When activated, the α 2 A subtype elicits a hypotensive response whereas the α 2 B subtype medi-ates a hypertensive effect that counteracts the hypotensive response by the α 2 A subtype. We have previously shown that spinophilin attenuates the α 2 AAR-dependent hypotensive response; in spinophilin null mice, this response is highly potentiated. In this study, we dem-onstrate that spinophilin impedes arrestin-dependent phosphorylation and desensitization of the α 2 BAR subtype by competing against arrestin binding to this receptor subtype. The Del 301 - 303 α 2 BAR, a human variation that shows impaired phosphorylation and desensiti-zation and is linked to hypertension in certain populations, exhibits preferential interaction with spinophilin over arrestin. Furthermore, Del 301 - 303 α 2 BAR-induced ERK signaling is quickly desensitized in cells without spinophilin expression, showing a profile similar to that induced by the wild type receptor in these cells. Together, these data suggest a critical role of spinophilin in sustaining α 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling.</b> Consistent with this notion, our in vivo study reveals that the α 2 BAR-elicited hypertensive response is diminished in spinophilin deficien...|$|R

In vitro studies suggest that activation of the A 2 B adenosine receptor (A 2 BAR) results in proinflammatory and profibrotic effects relevant to the progression of lung diseases; however, in vivo data supporting these observations are lacking. Adenosine deaminase-deficient (ADA-deficient) mice develop pulmonary inflammation and injury that are dependent on increased lung adenosine levels. To investigate {{the role of the}} A 2 BAR in vivo, ADA-deficient mice were treated with the selective A 2 BAR antagonist CVT- 6883, and pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and airspace integrity were assessed. Untreated and vehicle-treated ADA-deficient mice developed pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and enlargement of alveolar airspaces; conversely, CVT- 6883 -treated ADA-deficient mice showed less pulmonary inflammation, fibrosis, and alveolar airspace enlargement. A 2 BAR antagonism significantly reduced elevations in proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines as well as mediators of fibrosis and airway destruction. In addition, treatment with CVT- 6883 attenuated pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in wild-type mice subjected to bleomycin-induced lung injury. These findings suggest that A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> influences pathways critical for pulmonary inflammation and injury in vivo.

40|$|High fat diet (HFD) -induced type 2 {{diabetes}} {{continues to}} be an epidemic with significant risk for various pathologies. Previously, we identified the A 2 b adenosine receptor (A 2 bAR), an established regulator of inflammation, as a regulator of HFD-induced insulin resistance. In particular, HFD was associated with vast upregulation of liver A 2 bAR in control mice, and while mice lacking this receptor showed augmented liver inflammation and tissue insulin resistance. As the A 2 bAR is expressed in different tissues, here, we provide the first lead to cellular mechanism by demonstrating that the receptor’s influence on tissue insulin sensitivity is mediated via its expression in macrophages. This was shown using a newly generated transgenic mouse model expressing the A 2 bAR gene in the macrophage lineage on an otherwise A 2 bAR null background. Reinstatement of macrophage A 2 bAR expression in A 2 bAR null mice fed HFD restored insulin tolerance and tissue insulin signaling to the level of control mice. The molecular mechanism for this effect involves A 2 bAR-mediated changes in cyclic adenosine monophosphate in macrophages, reducing the expression and release of inflammatory cytokines, which downregulate insulin receptor- 2. Thus, our results illustrate that macrophage A 2 <b>bAR</b> <b>signaling</b> is needed and sufficient for relaying the protective effect of the A 2 bAR against HFD-induced tissue inflammation and insulin resistanc...|$|R

BACKGROUNDIncreased myocardial expression of βARK 1 {{has been shown to be}} associated with HF and certain models of hypertrophy. METHODSTgα 43 mice and their nontransgenic littermate controls were treated with the α 1 AR agonist phenylephrine (PE) for 3, 7 or 14 days to characterize the cardiac consequences. RESULTSNontransgenic littermate control mice treated for 14 days with PE display cardiac hypertrophy with no increase in βARK 1 expression. However, Tgα 43 animals show a reduced tolerance to 14 -day PE treatment, demonstrated by reduced survival and severe cardiac hypertrophy. Moreover, PE treatment for three and seven days in Tgα 43 mice resulted in an exaggerated hypertrophic response accompanied by significant cardiac biochemical abnormalities that are normally associated with HF, including fetal gene expression, reduced βAR density and enhanced βARK 1 expression. We also found reduced myocardial stores of the sympathetic neurotransmitter neuropeptide Y. CONCLUSIONSThese data suggest that PE-treated Tgα 43 mice have chronic activation of the cardiac sympathetic nervous system, which may be responsible for the appearance of apparent maladaptive hypertrophy with an evolution towards HF and sudden death. Thus, the cardiac phenotypes found in these mice are not the direct result of enhanced α 1 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> and suggest that βARK 1 is a key molecule in the transition of myocardial hypertrophy to HF...|$|R

Here, we examined the contribution of individual adenosine receptors (ARs: A 1 AR/A 2 AAR/A 2 BAR/A 3 AR) to vascular leak induced by hypoxia. Initial profiling studies revealed that siRNA-mediated repression of the A 2 BAR selectively increased endothelial leak in response to hypoxia in vitro. In parallel, vascular permeability was significantly increased in vascular organs of A 2 BAR−/−-mice subjected to ambient hypoxia (8 % oxygen, 4 hours; eg, lung: 2. 1 ± 0. 12 -fold increase). By contrast, hypoxia-induced vascular leak was not accentuated in A 1 AR−/−-, A 2 AAR−/−-, or A 3 AR−/−-deficient mice, suggesting a degree of specificity for the A 2 BAR. Further studies in wild type mice revealed that the selective A 2 BAR antagonist PSB 1115 resulted in profound increases in hypoxia-associated vascular leakage while A 2 BAR agonist (BAY 60 - 6583 [2 -[6 -amino- 3, 5 -dicyano- 4 -[4 -(cyclopropylmethoxy) -. phenyl]pyridin- 2 -ylsulfanyl]acetamide]) treatment was associated with almost complete reversal of hypoxia-induced vascular leakage (eg, lung: 2. 0 ± 0. 21 -fold reduction). Studies in bone marrow chimeric A 2 BAR mice suggested a predominant role of vascular A 2 BARs in this response, while hypoxia-associated increases in tissue neutrophils were, at least in part, mediated by A 2 BAR expressing hematopoietic cells. Taken together, these studies provide pharmacologic and genetic evidence for vascular A 2 <b>BAR</b> <b>signaling</b> as central control point of hypoxia-associated vascular leak...|$|R
