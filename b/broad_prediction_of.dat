40|$|AbstractHeadwater {{streams in}} the Ovens catchment, {{southeast}} Australia, have 3 H activities between 1. 63 and 2. 45 TU that {{are lower than}} those of local rainfall (∼ 3 TU). The variation of 3 H activities and major ion concentrations with streamflow implies that simple dilution of older groundwater with rainfall during high flow does not occur. Rather different stores of water from within the catchment (e. g. from the soil or regolith) are mobilized during rainfall events. Mean residence times estimated using an exponential-piston flow model 12 to 36 yearsduringsummer baseflow and 6 to 14 yearsduring recession from higher flows. A broad correlation between 3 H activities and the percentage of rainfall exported from each catchment may reflect local differences in recharge and evapotranspiration; this correlation allows a <b>broad</b> <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> likely residence times. These streams are buffered against rainfall variations on timescales of a few years;however, the impacts of changes to landuse or longer timescale changes to rainfallmay take years to decades to manifest itself in changes to streamflow or water quality...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{utilization}} of terrestrial vehicles requires devotion of huge {{efforts to provide}} road infrastructure for increased accessibility. Meanwhile, {{there is no doubt}} that transportation infrastructure has major impacts on ecosystems, ecological processes and biodiversity at a landscape scale. These impacts result from habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, spreading of invasive species, noise pollution, road mortality but also more unknown impacts such as altered isolation patterns. This study aims to picture probable impacts of noise in the current transportation infrastructure at a national scale in Sweden. The study involves mapping of potential conflict zones between roads and ecological networks by defining road-effect zones around roads based on traffic volume, surrounding vegetation type, land cover type and consequently noise level for each segment of the roads. Focal to this study are impacts of noise on areas of importance for nature conservation like key habitat areas, meadows, pastures and wetlands. A method called "Calculation of Road Traffic Noise" (CRTN) was selected for calculation of noise generated by traffic flows in Sweden. The analysis was performed by using data on roads from the National Road Database and SAMPERS, land cover data, data on biodiversity conservation, and national databases concerning nature values. The analysis was done with a spatial prediction model based on a Geographic Information System (GIS), using Sweden as a case study. According to the results, 813 ha of nature values are exposed to noise levels higher than 55 dB; same wise, 2190 ha of outlined areas with nature values are exposed to noise higher than 45 dB. The study provided baseline information and a <b>broad</b> <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> main impacts on biodiversity at landscape and regional scales. Impact prediction of alternative planning scenarios will be facilitated using the GIS-based prediction models and assist decision making on allocation of future roads. Using such methods when discussing future localization of road infrastructure will be useful for integrated sustainability assessment and strategic environmental assessment. Thus, it provides possibilities for minimizing adverse impacts of infrastructure on biodiversity at an early planning stage...|$|E

40|$|Because organisms {{have limited}} {{resources}} to allocate to multiple life history traits, the Optimal Defense Theory (ODT) and the Growth-Differentiation Balance Hypothesis (GDBH) {{were developed by}} terrestrial plant ecologists to predict intraindividual defense allocation based {{on the cost of}} defense and these life history trade-offs. However, these theories have garnered equivocal experimental support over the years and are rarely experimentally extended from <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> plant physiology to the palatability of the tissues an herbivore experiences. We therefore examined tissue palatability, nutritional value, and defense mechanisms in multiple Dictyotalean seaweeds in two Caribbean locations, using two herbivores. Relative palatability of tissues varied greatly with algal species, grazer species, and location. Because older bases were not consistently defended, GDBH did not predict relative palatability. We could not reject ODT without intensive measures of tissue fitness value and herbivore risk, and this theory was therefore not useful in making <b>broad</b> <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> tissue palatability. In testing the physiological <b>predictions</b> <b>of</b> these theories, we found the young, growing apices of these seaweeds to be generally more nutritionally valuable than the old, anchoring bases and found organic-rich apices to be more chemically deterrent, thus supporting ODT. However, the combined chemical, nutritional, and structural traits of these algae all influenced herbivore choice. As a result, these patterns of apical value and chemical defense reflected palatability of live tissues for only one of five algal species, which rendered ODT and GDBH poor predictors of relative palatability for most algae.

40|$|The {{two areas}} of theory upon which this {{research}} was based were „strategy development process?(SDP) and „complex adaptive systems? (CAS), as part of complexity theory, focused on human social organisations. The literature reviewed showed {{that there is a}} paucity of empirical work and theory in the overlap of the two areas, providing an opportunity for contributions to knowledge in each area of theory, and for practitioners. An inductive approach was adopted for this research, in an effort to discover new insights to the focus area of study. It was undertaken from within an interpretivist paradigm, and based on a novel conceptual framework. The organisationally intimate nature of the research topic, and the researcher?s circumstances required a research design that was both in-depth and long term. The result was a single, exploratory, case study, which included use of data from 44 in-depth, semi-structured interviews, from 36 people, involving all the top management team members and significant other staff members; observations, rumour and grapevine (ORG) data; and archive data, over a 5 ½ year period (2005 – 2010).

Comparison of the magnetic structure factors with model calculations shows that the magnetization is associated principally with those atoms which in their elemental state are themselves magnetic. The observed deviations of the magnetic moment distributions from spherical symmetry have been used to deduce which of the 3 d sub-bands are active at the Fermi energy. A small moment close to the limits of resolution is observed at some of the Z sites, together with a small delocalized moment which in most cases is negative.

Typically, crude proxies or location dummy variables are used to approximate spatial effects. GIS tools, however, now allow spatially explicit data {{to be included in}} household econometric models of technology adoption. This paper describes a study that combined GIS and survey variables to examine the cattle feeding strategies on farms in highland Kenya. Data from a large geo-referenced household survey were combined with GIS-derived variables to comprehensively evaluate the spatial, agro-ecological, market and farm resource factors that determine variability of feeding strategies on smallholder dairy farms. Roads, urban populations, milk collection and processing facilities were digitised, and integrated with spatial coverages of agro-ecology. These were then combined, using econometric methods, to quantify the main spatial and local determinants of the probability of adoption of: a) stall feeding or zero-grazing, and b) planted fodder in the form of Napier grass. The results show the influence not only of agro-ecology, but also of market infrastructure and support services on the adoption of improved feeding strategies.

40|$|The {{last decade}} {{has seen a}} huge {{increase}} {{in the amount of}} “omics” data available and in our ability to interpret those data. The aim {{of this paper is to}} consider how omics techniques can be used to improve and refine microbiological risk assessment, using dose response models for RNA viruses, with particular reference to norovirus through the oral route as the case study. The dose response model for initial infection in the gastrointestinal tract is broken down into the component steps at the molecular level and the feasibility of assigning probabilities to each step assessed. The molecular mechanisms are not sufficiently well understood at present to enable quantitative estimation of probabilities on the basis of omics data. At present, the great strength of gene sequence data appears to be in giving information on the distribution and proportion of susceptible genotypes (for example due to the presence of the appropriate pathogen-binding receptor) in the host population rather than in predicting specificities from the amino acid sequences concurrently obtained. The nature of the mutant spectrum in RNA viruses greatly complicates the application of omics approaches to development of mechanistic dose response models and prevents <b>prediction</b> <b>of</b> risks of disease progression (given infection has occurred) at the level of the individual host. However, molecular markers in the host and virus may enable more <b>broad</b> <b>predictions</b> to be made about the consequences of exposure in a population. In an alternative approach, comparing the results of deep sequencing of RNA viruses in the faeces/vomitus from donor humans with those from their infected recipients may enable direct estimates of the average probability of infection per virion to be made...|$|R

Industrial activity has spread from developed to geographically close developing countries in sectors that are intensive in immobile primary factors {{and not too}} heavily dependent on linkages with other firms. Only developing countries with an already established industrial base achieved industrialization in other sectors. The sizable change in both the size and structure of manufactured exports from developing countries has not been associated with corresponding changes in manufacturing value added. To benefit more from relocating industrial activities, developing countries need to create the critical mass of linkages that provide pecuniary externalities to industrial firms. ...|$|R
