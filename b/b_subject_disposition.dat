40|$|Forty-one health {{professional}} students were videotaped during three consecutive conditions: a 5 -min {{wait for a}} tardy interviewer, the structured interview for determining the Type A behavior pattern, and a 5 -min relaxation period. Afterward, subjects were classified as Type A or B based on audiotapes of the interview. The total amount of activity and the frequency or duration of Type A behaviors were compared between Type A and Type <b>B</b> <b>subjects.</b> In all three experimental conditions, Type A subjects moved their arms more than Type <b>B</b> <b>subjects.</b> During both the waiting and the relaxation periods, Type A subjects sat still less and spent more time exploring than did Type <b>B</b> <b>subjects.</b> During the interview, Type A subjects gestured more frequently than Type <b>B</b> <b>subjects.</b> Nonverbal behaviors correctly identified behavior pattern in 71 % of the subjects.

This interaction indicated that Type A subjects responded more rapidly under unpaced conditions than did Type <b>B</b> <b>subjects,</b> although there was little difference between the groups under paced conditions. Under dual-task conditions, Type A subjects responded more rapidly than did Type <b>B</b> <b>subjects</b> regardless of pacing.

40|$|BACKGROUND:The Hosmer-Lemeshow test, used {{extensively}} {{to assess the}} fit of the logistic regression model, is performed by several statistical packages. Recent studies have shown some problems {{in the use of}} this test when ties are present. These problems were attributed merely to the test implementation. METHODS:We analysed the order of the observations as an alternative explanation of the problem of ties. Using a data-set of 1393 intensive care unit (ICU) patients we performed the Hosmer-Lemeshow test with all possible <b>subjects</b> <b>dispositions.</b> RESULTS:We obtained about one million different P values, ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 95. DISCUSSION:It is already known that when the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test is performed with a number of covariate patterns lower than the number of subjects, its result may be inaccurate. We showed that the extent of this problem could be relevant under particular conditions. We also suggest a strategy for estimating the extent of the problem and subsequent interpretation...|$|R
