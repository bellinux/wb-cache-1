Some women said they lost their academic status as golden girls overnight; grants dried up, letters of recommendation were no longer forthcoming. No one was met with a coherent process that was not weighted against them. Usually, the key decision-makers in the college or university—especially if it was a private university—joined forces to, in effect, collude with the faculty member accused; to protect not him necessarily but the reputation of the university, and to keep information from surfacing in a way that could protect other women. The goal seemed to be not to provide a balanced forum, but damage control.|$|E
500|$|Believing {{that his}} {{character}} was [...] "sort of a surrogate father figure" [...] to Henry, Sbarge {{admitted that the}} script [...] "made me weep <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> came up with is so lovely and magical and delightful." [...] Referring to his character's storyline as a hero's journey, Sbarge said the intention was to show that Jiminy Cricket did not just begin as a noble guy – [...] "what {{you get to see}} on this trip are the fire rings he had to walk through to get to a place where he could evolve to develop a sense of doing the right thing." [...] The episode featured guest stars Harry Groener and Carolyn Hennesy as Jiminy's parents Martin and Myrna. Groener had previously worked with Espenson in the third season of the fantasy television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer. It is their only appearances in the series.|$|E

500|$|While Monroe {{remains a}} {{cultural}} icon, critics are divided on her legacy as an actress. David Thomson called her {{body of work}} [...] "insubstantial" [...] and Pauline Kael wrote {{that she could not}} act, but rather [...] "used her lack of an actress's skills to amuse the public. She had the wit or crassness or desperation to turn cheesecake into acting – and vice versa; she did what others had the 'good taste' not to do". In contrast, according to Peter Bradshaw, Monroe was a talented comedian who [...] "understood how comedy achieved its effects", and [...] Roger Ebert wrote that [...] "Monroe's eccentricities and neuroses on sets became notorious, but studios put up with her long after any other actress would have been blackballed <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> got back on the screen was magical". Similarly, Jonathan Rosenbaum stated that [...] "she subtly subverted the sexist content of her material" [...] and that [...] "the difficulty some people have discerning Monroe's intelligence as an actress seems rooted in the ideology of a repressive era, when superfeminine women weren't supposed to be smart".|$|E

In response to Holder's speech, Hanson wrote a column titled [...] "Facing Facts about Race" [...] where he offered up his own version (and others') of [...] "the Talk", namely the need to inform his children to be careful of young black men when venturing into the inner city, who Hanson argued were statistically more likely to commit violent crimes than young men of other races, and that therefore it was understandable for the police to focus on groups with the highest statistical crime rates, which turn out to be young black males.|$|E

60|$|And thus, in full, {{there are}} four classes: the men who feel nothing, and {{therefore}} see truly; the men who feel strongly, think weakly, and see untruly (second order of poets); the men who feel strongly, think strongly, and see truly (first order of poets); and the men who, strong as human creatures can be, are yet submitted to influences stronger than they, and see in a sort untruly, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see is inconceivably above them.

50|$|Religious {{discrimination}} {{treating a}} person or group differently <b>because</b> of <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believe in.

50|$|The {{project has}} also {{received}} some more critical responses.

60|$|They {{all knew}} where that place was, {{but few of}} the Jungle People ever went there, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> called the Cold Lairs was an old deserted city, lost and buried in the jungle, and beasts seldom use a place that men have once used. The wild boar will, but the hunting tribes do not. Besides, the monkeys lived there {{as much as they}} could be said to live anywhere, and no self-respecting animal would come within eyeshot of it except in times of drought, when the half-ruined tanks and {{reservoirs}} held a little water.|$|E
60|$|I shall {{conclude}} this {{sketch of}} the foliage art of England, by mention of two artists, whom I believe to be representative of a considerable class, admirable in their reverence and patience of study, yet unappreciated by the public, <b>because</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> do is unrecommended by dexterities of handling. The forest studies of J. Linnell are peculiarly elaborate, and, in many points, most skilful; they fail perhaps of interest, owing to over-fulness of detail and a want of generalization in the effect; but even {{a little more of}} the Harding sharpness of touch would set off their sterling qualities, and make them felt. A less known artist, S. Palmer, lately admitted a member of the Old Water-Color Society, is deserving of the very highest place among faithful followers of nature. His studies of foreign foliage especially are beyond all praise for care and fulness. I have never seen a stone pine or a cypress drawn except by him; and his feeling is as pure and grand as his fidelity is exemplary. He has not, however, yet, I think, discovered what is necessary and unnecessary in a great picture; and his works, sent to the Society's rooms, have been most unfavorable examples of his power, and have been generally, as yet, in places where all that is best in them is out of sight. I look to him, nevertheless, unless he lose himself in over-reverence for certain conventionalisms of the elder schools, as one of the probable renovators and correctors of whatever is failing or erroneous in the practice of English art.|$|E
