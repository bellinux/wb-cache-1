It is found, as a result of heavy waves, that the steeper the initial beach slope, the larger the resulting <b>beach</b> <b>scarp.</b> The rise in water level is added to the mean water level accelerates the generation of the <b>beach</b> <b>scarp,</b> as well.

40|$|International audienceA field-based {{experimental}} study of <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> morphodynamic evolution {{was conducted on the}} shoreface of a macrotidal sandy beach subject to storms combined with spring tide events (Luc-sur-Mer, France). Both video and in-situ measurements on an artificial berm are used to understand <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> evolution over one tide during stormy conditions. Image time stacks are used to analyze the swash action on the <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> and topo-graphical data of the scarp are recorded with a terrestrial scanner laser to quantify the morphodynamic response of the <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> to wave action. This work provides a new and unique dataset about <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> changes and berm morphology in particular under rising tide and oblique wind-wave conditions. During one stormy event, the berm was completely destroyed. However, contrasting alongshore changes were measured during the erosive phase with different crest and foot scarp retreats and eroded volumes between the west and {{the east side of the}} berm. The beach in front of the scarp also shows a contrasting residual evolution, indicating an evident longshore sediment transport on the study area as a consequence of incident oblique wave conditions. A strong connection between beach evolution and <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> changes is clearly identified. The scarp erosion increases on the west side of the berm when the beach level is lowered and reduces when the beach surface rises on the east side. The beach slope and foreshore elevation as a result of a longshore sediment transport between east and west profiles, influence swash activity. Overall, water depth and swash activity became progressively different along the scarp during the experiment. Swash measurements indicate that the presence of the <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> strongly influences the swash motion. At high tide, the reflection of the uprush on the scarp front induces a collision between the reflected backwash and the following uprush dynamic. These collisions reduce and sometimes stop the motion of the following uprush, reducing the incoming swash excursion. Consequently, the scarp presence modifies the swash interaction that normally appears on a planar beach surface. With a <b>beach</b> <b>scarp,</b> the swash energy level is substantially attenuated and its spectrum is characterized by a large band. The number of uprush impacts on the scarp front calculated from video images reaches about 25 per 5 min. In spite of the swash energy attenuation due to swash/swash interactions, these impacts provoke the berm destruction in about two hours. However, the onshore migration of the swash zone induced by the rising tide appears to be important to explain scarp destruction, compensating the attenuated swash activity due to backwash-uprush interactions...|$|E

40|$|The dataset {{from the}} SUPERTANK {{laboratory}} experiment was analyzed to examine wave runup {{and the corresponding}} upper limit of beach-profile change. Thirty SUPERTANK runs were investigated that included both erosional and accretionary wave conditions with random and monochromatic waves. The upper limit of beach change UL was found to approximately equal the vertical excursion of total wave runup, Rtw. An exception was runs where <b>beach</b> or dune <b>scarps</b> were produced, which substantially limit the uprush of swash motion to produce a much reduced total runup. Based on the SUPERTANK dataset, the vertical extent of wave runup above mean water level on a <b>beach</b> without <b>scarp</b> formation was found to approximately equal the significant breaking wave height, Hbs. Therefore, a new and simple relation Rtw = Hbs is proposed. The linear relationship between total runup and breaking wave height {{is supported by a}} conceptual derivation. In addition, the relation is extended to UL = Rtw = Hbs to approximate the upper limit of beach change. This formula accurately reproduced the measured upper limit of beach change from the three-dimensional experiments in the Corps 2 ̆ 7 large-scale sediment transport facility. For the studied laboratory cases, predictions of wave runup were not improved by including a slope-dependent surf-similarity parameter. The limit of wave runup was substantially less for monochromatic waves than for random waves, attributed to absence of low-frequency motion...|$|R
40|$|Five {{years of}} beach {{topography}} data were examined {{to map the}} spatio-temporal patterns in <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> existence. Data of the Sand Engine were used, a mega scale nourishment implemented in 2011 at the Dutch coast. Topographic data were automatically and manually analyzed to recognize scarps in the dataset. Moments of destruction and persistence of scarps {{were found to be}} dependent on wave run-up levels. At the site observed, scarps are often created during spring and summer months during mild wave conditions. During storms in autumn and winter the wave run-up exceeds the crest level of the scarp causing a removal of the scarps along the full perimeter. These findings suggest that the platform height of a beach nourishment is an important parameter for the persistence of beach scarps at recently nourished sites.

40|$|A survey dataset {{taken at}} the Sand Engine mega-nourishment on the {{southwest}} coast of Holland was analyzed {{in an attempt to}} locate beach scarps and characterize their development. A <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> is defined as a vertical discontinuity in the upper foreshore slope generated through the removal of sediment by natural processes. More specifically, this report defines a scarp as a feature with a minimum height of 30 cm and a slope of 0. 15. A few studies on <b>beach</b> <b>scarp</b> behavior have been investigated in recent years, but there is still quantitative ambiguity regarding the parameters that determine their post-nourishment generation, which can partially be attributed to their ephemeral nature. In turn, this lack of knowledge has directly hindered our ability to predict and/or prevent their existence in future nourishment projects. Scarps were identified by use of an automated tool created to locate the steepest sections in the beach profile. This tool identifies the scarp crest (top) and toe (bottom) by the local minimum and maximum of the second order derivative of the profile elevations. Scarps were also identified by means of manual transect analysis to validate this automated process. These features were observed during 15 of the 33 measurement periods, with 8 / 15 being summer months and 3 / 15 being winter months. Thus, this scarping phenomena yields a strong seasonal signal with the majority of removal periods occurring during winter months when the wave climates were more energetic; however, it was also observed that calmer periods interrupted by storm events were also capable of altering scarp geometries. Scarping at the Sand Engine consistently occurred between + 3 & + 2 m NAP, with the average scarp height at the southern flank, head, and point being 0. 85, 0. 78 & 1. 0 m respectively. In general, scarps follow an overall pattern of periodic variability at the Sand Engine depending on the original profile geometry, water levels (storm surge & tidal elevation), and wave runup events. Observations showed that already developed scarps were only affected when the maximum runup levels (RHI) exceeded the scarp toe (SLO), which occurs during the collision, overtopping, and inundation regimes. The collision regime is responsible for the landward migration of the scarp without destroying the entire feature; the runup elevation is able to reach the scarp base inducing an undercutting effect which leads to slumping of the scarp face, but not necessarily to complete removal. Furthermore, scarps were completely removed only upon entering the overtopping and/or inundation regimes. It appeared the swash regime had no effect on the scarps at all considering the geometric characteristics remained approximately constant between measurement periods, insinuating the water levels were not high enough for the resulting runup to reach the scarp base. Thus, storm surge and tidal elevations have a strong influence on scarp generation/degradation at the Sand Engine, by exposing a greater area of the coast to wave attack.

40|$|Lake C. W. McConaughy, a 63 -year-old manmade {{reservoir}} in the North Platte Valley {{of western}} Nebraska, {{is the largest}} standing body {{of water in the}} state. From the time that Kingsley Dam was completed in 1941 until the present day (2004), many geomorphic and environmental changes have occurred along the shores and within the North Platte Valley. Erosion on the southeastern shoreline of the lake had been perceived as a problem for landowners and managers for at least three decades, but the full scale of erosion was revealed only after a cumulative 18 -m drawdown in lake level: bedrock platforms, extending from cliffs on headlands, as well as minor caves, alcoves, potholes, and <b>beach</b> erosion <b>scarps</b> were revealed. Actual headland retreat since 1941 has probably been on a scale of magnitude of tens of meters. Erosional platforms, however, are as much as 266 m in length, indicating that they are, collectively, the results of a combination of pre-reservoir geomorphic conditions, erosion during reservoir filling, and wave erosion after filling. Serial observations of the shoreline made in the period 1999 - 2002 demonstrated that shoreline erosion continues. Depositional features such as pocket beaches and beach ridges have formed de novo in bays between headlands. Also, a delta that prograded at least 4 km from the North Platte River into the lake between 1952 and 1993 continues to grow, and major morphometric changes have occurred on the North Platte River immediately upstream since 1941 in response to the elevation of the local base level by the lake; most of the change in channel patterns in the river upstream from the delta took place in a mere 8 years from 1952 to 1960. Since 1999, some emergent beaches and areas of exposed lake floor have developed sand dunes; eolian erosion and re-deposition is widespread elsewhere in these areas during periods of high winds, which are frequent in western Nebraska. The water table beneath lands adjacent to the reservoir generally rose until 1953 as the lake was filling. The far-flung irrigation system of which Lake McConaughy is the key element has elevated water tables as far as 250 km from the lake. Since at least 2000, soil salinization (episodic thenardite accumulation) has developed in exposed lake sediments at the western end of the lake. On a smaller scale, groundwater has been discharging lakeward along shoreline <b>beach</b> <b>scarps</b> through springs and seeps while lake levels have been low. Slightly lowering the operating level of Lake McConaughy could slow some of the more dramatic effects of shoreline erosion when the lake returns to its predrought volume, but erosion will continue, particularly at the ends of headlands on the southeastern shore, which are exposed to strong waves driven by northerly to northwesterly winds. Eolian erosion and re-deposition will, on the other hand, continue as long as lake level remains particularly low as a result of drought and the removal of irrigation waters. Salinization can be considered an ephemeral phenomenon, dependent on future management of the lake, but it indirectly represents the potential for larger-scale changes in hydrogeologic systems. The longer-term effects of lake-related water-table changes, both near the lake and downstream in irrigated lands, as well as the ability of the lake to supply irrigation water if drought conditions continue, remain to be seen...|$|R
40|$|Stabilization of the Yaquina Bay {{shoreline}} {{along the}} northeastern {{edge of the}} Hatfield Marine Science Center (HMSC) campus became necessary to halt erosion that threatened both HMSC critical infrastructure (seawater storage tank) and public access to the HMSC Nature Trail. A Dynamic Revetment (gravel beach) was installed in November, 2011 on 260 feet of shoreline to mitigate erosion. Shoreline topographic and biological monitoring was initiated before and has continued after the project completion. Monitoring of beach profiles indicated that as of December 2012, the 2011 Dynamic Revetment Project (DRP) has successfully stabilized the shoreline in the project area, while rapid erosion has continued in the adjacent Reference beach area. Erosion in the unprotected Reference area in the period 2009 - 2012 has been as great as 9 m (29. 5 ft). Beach profile data also indicated that the 2007 DRP continued {{to be successful in}} stabilizing further retreat of the shoreline. There were significantly more invertebrates associated with beach wrack in the 2011 DRP area as compared with the Reference or 2007 DRP areas. Beach wrack did not tend to accumulate in the Reference area because of vertical <b>beach</b> <b>scarps</b> generated by erosion. The reason for the difference with the 2007 DRP area is unclear. Fish were significantly more abundant in the Reference area compared to the DRP. However, as with the pre-project sampling, maximum abundance was consistently observed at Reference Site 4, which has a uniquely high degree of physical habitat complexity, resulting from trees that have been eroded onto the shore. There were significantly greater vegetation coverage and significantly lesser presence of non-living substrata in the Reference area as compared to the DRP. These differences are consistent with pre-project site differences, probably resulting from a low area of the shoreline which allows increased flooding and associated disturbance in the DRP back shore area. There were no marine mammals observed in either the DRP or Reference areas over the 43 surveys conducted over the 2012 survey period. As was observed in the 2011 report, variability among observation periods for birds was extremely high, with many zero observations. Although there were about three times more birds observed in the Reference area, there were no statistically significant differences in the number of birds observed based either on tide (high vs. low) or sample area (DRP vs. Reference). The number of bird taxa observed was similar in both areas, and most abundant species were similar between the two areas. Fish, birds and wrack invertebrates, such as beach hoppers), were shown to utilize the DRP project area. Biological differences in fish, birds and vegetation observed in year 1 of post-project monitoring tended to reflect differences in habitat that were present before the DRP project...|$|R
