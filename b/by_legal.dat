5|$|Also in 1957, Florida's {{response}} was mixed. Its legislature passed an Interposition Resolution denouncing {{the decision and}} declaring it null and void. But Florida Governor LeRoy Collins, though joining in the protest against the court decision, refused to sign it, arguing that the attempt to overturn the ruling must be done <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> methods.|$|E
5|$|Korematsu v. United States {{was decided}} {{the next year}} and overshadowed both the Yasui and Hirabayashi cases. None of these cases have ever been {{overturned}} by the Supreme Court.

Criticism has included the racist aspects of the cases and the later discovery that officials in the United States Department of Justice lied to the court {{at the time of the}} trial.|$|E
5|$|Royal {{intermarriage}} is {{the practice}} of members of ruling dynasties marrying into other reigning families.

5|$|While Terminator Salvation was {{initially}} intended {{to begin a}} new trilogy, production of a fifth film was halted <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> trouble, as well as The Halcyon Company filing for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. While some anonymous sources insisted that Terminator 5 would be moving forward, the majority of analysts predicted that its future was in jeopardy.|$|E
5|$|After {{a troubled}} {{pre-production}} characterized <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> disputes, Mario Kassar of Carolco Pictures emerged with the franchise's property rights in early 1990. This {{paved the way}} for the completion of the screenplay by a Cameron-led production team, and the October 1990 start of a shortened 186-day filming schedule. The production of Terminator 2 required a $102 million budget making it the most expensive film made up to that point. Much of the film's massive budget was spent on filming and special effects. The film was released on July 3, 1991, in time for the U.S. Independence Day weekend. In 2017, Terminator2 was re-released in 3D, 4K resolution for AMC and Cineplex theaters. The re-released debuted at number one in the United Kingdom during the weekend of its release.|$|E

5|$|Attempts by law {{enforcement}} to investigate conditions at Gold Base have been blocked <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> difficulties and the unwillingness {{of those on the}} base to talk to the police. According to Lawrence Wright, who wrote an account of the Hole in his 2013 book , the Riverside County sheriff's office has never received a complaint from someone at the base about their treatment there, despite the many accounts of mistreatment. Wright attributes this to the fear that many Scientologists have of bringing shame upon Scientology and of being forced to break off contact with their families and friends.|$|E
5|$|Cook and Lemish {{speculate}} that the 610 Office was created outside the traditional state-based security system for several reasons: first, a number of officials within the military and security agencies were practicing Falun Gong, leading Jiang and other CPC leaders to fear that these organizations had already been quietly compromised; second, {{there was a need}} for a nimble and powerful organization to coordinate the anti-Falun Gong campaign; third, the creation of a top-level party organization sent a message down the ranks that the anti-Falun Gong campaign was a priority; and finally, CPC leaders did not want the anti-Falun Gong campaign to be hindered <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> or bureaucratic restrictions, and thus established the 610 Office extrajudicially.|$|E
5|$|The club's main sponsor is Kingsford Capital Management, {{which was}} {{confirmed}} {{at the start}} of the 2015–16 season, taking over from beverage company MacB. The new sponsorship deal is thought to be worth around £200,000 for two years, which includes shirt, mascot and stadium sponsor. Initially, MacB went into administration halfway through the 2011—12 season, and was replaced <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> company Just Employment Law for the remainder of the season. MacB resumed sponsorship of Partick Thistle in the summer of 2012, and subsequently signed a two-year extension, keeping them as main sponsors until the end of the 2014–15 season. Scottish security system company Alarmfast also started sponsoring Thistle for the 2014–15 season.|$|E

5|$|The factual {{accuracy}} of the series is often criticised <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> professionals and journalists; many of the decisions taken by Deed are unlikely to happen in a real court. The romanticised vision of the court system created by Newman caused a judge to issue a warning to a jury {{not to let the}} series influence their view of trials—referring to an episode where Deed flouts rules when called up for jury service. A complaint was made by a viewer about one episode claiming biased and incorrect information about the MMR vaccine, leading the BBC to unilaterally ban repeats of it in its original form. All six series (with the exception of the two banned episodes from Series Five) have been released on DVD in the UK.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the ruling {{in this case was}} that it tested the constitutionality of the Act and confirmed Congress' authority over Indian affairs. Plenary power over Indian tribes, supposedly granted to the U.S. Congress by the Commerce Clause of the Constitution, was not deemed necessary to support the Supreme Court in this decision; instead, the Court found the power in the tribes' status as dependent domestic nations. This allowed Congress to pass the Dawes Act the following year. The case has been criticized <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> scholars as drawing on powers that are not granted to Congress by the Constitution. It remains , despite that criticism.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} in the High Court decided that {{although there was no}} right at common law to have publicly provided legal representation in all cases, in some cases representation is appropriate to ensure a fair trial. Although judges no longer have the power to appoint counsel for an accused, since that function has been largely taken over <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> aid agencies, a trial judge should use their power to adjourn a case if it is in the interests of fairness that an accused have representation, which would encourage the legal aid agencies to provide counsel.|$|E

5|$|The {{number of}} {{footpath}} {{users in the}} more popular walking areas in the Peak District has contributed to serious erosion problems, particularly on the fragile peat moorlands of the Dark Peak. The recent use of some paths by mountain bikers is believed by some to have exacerbated an existing problem. Measures taken to contain the damage have included the permanent diversion of the official route of the Pennine Way out of Edale, which now goes up Jacob's Ladder rather than following the Grindsbrook, and the surfacing of many moorland footpaths with expensive natural stone paving. Certain rights of way have been damaged <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> and illegal use by off-road vehicles such as 4×4s and trail bikes, which campaigners have sought to reduce.|$|E
5|$|While {{generally}} {{successful with}} his race horses, Zayat's goal {{of winning the}} Kentucky Derby eluded him several times, including three second-place finishes, until his win with American Pharoah. He also filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings in 2010 when a bank called a note due and tried to foreclose on his horses. Zayat Stables successfully completed its Chapter 11 reorganization, but Zayat was next plagued <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> issues related to his penchant for betting {{large sums of money}} on horse racing. Nonetheless, Zayat generated considerable positive publicity on social media for his efforts to save his racehorse Paynter from life-threatening health problems, a successful struggle that earned the colt the 2012 NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E
5|$|After {{shooting}} Magruder {{and killing}} Arnaud, Logan then fled {{the scene with}} Kromah in a silver-painted Dodge Charger with Maryland license plates, with Kromah driving the vehicle. After leaving the house, Kromah took the weapon from Logan and attempted to wipe off any residual evidence, such as fingerprints, from it. The two then disposed of the murder weapon by burying it at a nearby forested cemetery and abandoned the getaway vehicle. Kromah was captured and charged as an accomplice to the murder; he pleaded guilty on April 24, 2003 to being an accessory after the fact to a murder. In the meantime, Logan stayed briefly at the residence of Twyla James, a woman who lived in Largo, Maryland. James would later be arrested and charged as an accessory to murder as she transported Logan, whom she had known was a murder suspect and fugitive sought <b>by</b> <b>legal</b> authorities, to her residence and allowed him to stay there. Logan was apprehended {{two days after the}} murder, on August 31, 2002, at a shed near the Quebec Arms Apartments in Hyattsville, Maryland, on the 8200 block of 14th Avenue. He was spotted there by undercover policemen, who had received information that it had been an area that Logan was known to frequent in the past. Logan was found hiding in the shed by policemen, who then used a police canine and a taser to subdue and apprehend him.|$|E
