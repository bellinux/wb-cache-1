5|$|Liverpool's victory {{set up a}} Community Shield {{match against}} Chelsea, winners of the 2005–06 Premier League. As FA Cup winners, Liverpool would have been awarded {{qualification}} into the UEFA Cup, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had qualified for the UEFA Champions League via their league position, the UEFA Cup place was passed to runners-up, West Ham.|$|E
5|$|Many educated Sudanese were {{suspicious}} of the Council and drifted towards the Khatmiyya side in the 1944 elections, not for religious reasons <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were hostile to the government, wanted to retain links with Egypt as a counterpoise to British influence {{and did not want}} a monarchy under Sayyid Abd al-Rahman.|$|E
5|$|This is {{a natural}} hot spring that spouts water {{constantly}} without stopping for recharge. Some of these are incorrectly called geysers, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are not periodic in nature they are not considered true geysers.|$|E
50|$|Individuals may be stymied {{in their}} careers not only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> lacked career {{development}} and job hunting skills <b>but</b> also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were driven by unconscious factors outside of their awareness.|$|R
50|$|Burgenland Croats emigrated {{not only}} because of the fear of Turkish attacks <b>but</b> also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were searching for jobs and better life opportunities.|$|R

5|$|In 2010, {{pterosaur}} researcher Alexander Kellner revisited H.W. Miller's classification. Kellner followed Miller's {{opinion that}} {{the differences between the}} Pteranodon species were great enough to place them into different genera. He placed P. sternbergi into the genus named by Miller, Geosternbergia, along with the Pierre Shale skull specimen which Bennett had previously considered to be a large male P. longiceps. Kellner argued that this specimen's crest, though incompletely preserved, was most similar to Geosternbergia. Because the specimen was millions of years younger than any known Geosternbergia, he assigned it to the new species Geosternbergia maysei. Numerous other pteranodont specimens are known from the same formation and time period, and Kellner suggested they may belong to the same species as G. maysei, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> lack skulls, he could not confidently identify them.|$|E
5|$|Inside the Austrian Netherlands themselves, {{the lawyers}} Jan Frans Vonck and Verlooy formed a secret society called Pro Aris et Focis in April or May 1790 {{in order to}} plan for an armed {{uprising}} against Austrian rule. Weapons and revolutionary tracts were distributed. Most {{of the members of}} the organisation came from the liberal professions (such as lawyers, writers and merchants). Most were moderates who did not object to Joseph II's reforms in principle <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had been levied on the territories without consultation. They were supported financially by the clergy. Initially members of the opposition were divided on how the uprising should occur. Unlike Van der Noot, Vonck believed that Belgium should liberate itself rather than rely on foreign aid.|$|E
5|$|Mole crickets are {{relatively}} common, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are nocturnal and spend nearly {{all their lives}} underground in extensive tunnel systems, they are rarely seen. They inhabit agricultural fields and grassy areas. They are present in every continent {{with the exception of}} Antarctica; by 2014, one hundred and seven species had been described and more species are likely to be discovered, especially in Asia. Neoscapteriscus didactylus is a widespread pest species, originating in South America it has spread to the West Indies and New South Wales in Australia. Gryllotalpa africana is a major pest in South Africa; other Gryllotalpa species are widely distributed in Europe, Asia and Australia. They are native to Britain (as to western Europe), but the former population of G. gryllotalpa may now be extinct in mainland Britain, surviving in the Channel Islands.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{boys were}} placed in {{criminal}} institutions (reformatories, detention centres and work farms) not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had committed any crime, <b>but</b> merely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had turned 14 and were therefore too old to remain in orphanages.|$|R
5000|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} that [...] "Roman magistrates treated the Jews the way <b>they</b> did not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were consciously tolerant, <b>but</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>they</b> {{had no reason to}} hinder the free exercise of Jewish religious practices." ...|$|R

5|$|On Shepard's second cruise with Cogswell, he was {{appointed}} a gunnery officer, responsible for the 20mm and 40mm antiaircraft guns on the ship's bow. They engaged kamikazes in the Battle of Okinawa, where the ship served in the dangerous role of a radar picket. The job of the radar pickets was to warn the fleet of incoming kamikazes; <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were often the first ships sighted by incoming Japanese aircraft, they were also the most likely ships to be attacked. Cogswell performed this duty from May 27, 1945, until June 26, when it rejoined Task Force 38. The ship also participated in the Allied naval bombardments of Japan, and was present in Tokyo Bay for the Surrender of Japan in September 1945. Shepard returned to the United States later that month.|$|E
5|$|The Bulls {{selected}} eighteen unprotected players, {{two from}} each of the nine other NBA teams. On {{the first day of the}} draft, they selected players from the Eastern Division teams; on the second day, they picked from the Western Division teams. The Bulls' selections included former first overall pick Bob Boozer, three-time All-Star Johnny Kerr and one-time All-Star Len Chappell. Kerr retired from playing prior to the start of the season, and was later named the franchise's first head coach. Another expansion draft pick, Al Bianchi, also retired as a player and was later named the team's assistant coach. Dick Klein had been planning to hire Kerr and Bianchi as coaches before the draft even took place, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were still under playing contracts with other teams, Klein needed to draft them instead of hiring them outright. Ten players from the expansion draft joined the Bulls for their inaugural season, but only six played more than one season for the team. Guy Rodgers—whom the Bulls acquired in exchange for Jim King and Jeff Mullins—and Jerry Sloan were named to the 1967 All-Star Game, becoming the franchise's first All-Stars.|$|E
25|$|In September 2005, Powell {{criticized the}} {{response}} to Hurricane Katrina. Powell said that {{thousands of people were}} not properly protected, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were poor rather than because they were black.|$|E

5000|$|The {{book was}} criticized by Norman G. Finkelstein {{who wrote in}} the Süddeutsche Zeitung:Lewy's {{argument}} goes like this: Gypsies were ruthlessly slaughtered by the Einsatzgruppen like the Jews, <b>but</b> only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were suspected of spying; Gypsies were deported to Auschwitz like the Jews, but only [...] "to get rid of them, not to kill them;" [...] Gypsies were gassed at Chelmno like the Jews, <b>but</b> only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had contracted typhus; most {{of the few remaining}} Gypsies were sterilized like the Jews, not however to prevent their propagation but only to [...] "prevent contamination of 'German blood.'" ...|$|R

25|$|Locals defended Ison {{not because}} they {{approved}} of murder and not because of an innate, clannish suspiciousness of outsiders, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> perceived the prying eyes of reporters to be an assault on manners, common decency, {{and the integrity of}} their communities.|$|E
25|$|Technically, the Ite missa est and the Benedicamus Domino, which {{conclude}} the Mass, {{belong to the}} Ordinary. They have their own Gregorian melodies, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are short and simple, and have rarely {{been the subject of}} later musical composition, they are often omitted in discussion.|$|E
25|$|Neither mobile profile {{includes}} {{support for}} the full Document Object Model (DOM), while only SVG Basic has optional support for scripting, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are fully compatible subsets of the full standard, most SVG graphics can still be rendered by devices which only support the mobile profiles.|$|E

50|$|It {{is evident}} that {{communist}} leaders pursued cultural leveling not only <b>because</b> <b>they</b> remained committed to the Marxist doctrine of eliminating class distinctions, <b>but</b> also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> deeply distrusted the old elites and were determined {{to prevent them from}} maintaining and reproducing their class advantage.|$|R
50|$|Turkish Cypriot folk dances are {{not only}} {{significant}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> are liked by the local people <b>but</b> also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> receive much critical acclaim {{in other parts of}} the world. Many folk dance groups are routinely representing North Cyprus international festivals throughout the year.|$|R
25|$|In July 1795 Godoy {{made peace}} with France, but the French {{residents}} in New Spain remained under suspicion by the government. The Crown also ordered increased vigilance in regard to United States citizens, {{not because of any}} known expansionist plots, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> were viewed as revolutionaries, along with the French.|$|E
25|$|The {{religious}} agricultural communes {{were replaced}} with state communes. These communes were attacked, {{not because of}} poor productivity <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> prevented the penetration of anti-religious propaganda into them. People from religious communes who joined state communes were blamed in the press for sabotaging the harvest {{and work on the}} communes.|$|E
25|$|Three justices {{joined in}} a concurring opinion (per Justice Sotomayor) that {{essentially}} reiterated now-retired Justice Stevens's argument in Bilski, on historical grounds, that business methods were categorically outside the patent system. <b>But</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> too agreed that the claimed subject matter was an abstract idea, they joined the main opinion also.|$|E
30|$|Bennmarker et al. (2007) {{documented}} that the median unemployment spell in Sweden is about 13  weeks. Spells may, however, not only end because individuals find employment <b>but</b> also <b>because</b> <b>they</b> decide {{to leave the}} labor market.|$|R

25|$|Another of the confiscated Polish mares, Taraszcza, was bred to the Crabbet-bred {{stallion}} Naseem at Tersk and foaled a grey colt named Negativ in 1945. Negativ sired 12 foal {{crops in}} Russia, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> did not excel on the racetrack he {{was sold to}} Poland in 1962, renamed “Negatiw,” and sired better racehorses out of the Polish mares.|$|E
25|$|Some ethnonyms {{have been}} {{considered}} offensive, although not always by the group involved, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> had been used by others or {{in the past in}} a derogatory sense and were therefore considered tainted, and requiring replacement for that reason. Examples are Gypsy, Negro, Vandal, Bushman, Philistinism. This change is not, however, a matter of anglicisation but of political correctness.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{it was found}} that herds also {{contained}} a number of older females that had never produced a living calf, or had given birth only once. Such animals are kept on, not out of a desire for large herds or for reasons of prestige, <b>but</b> <b>because</b> <b>they</b> often continue to produce milk, even without becoming pregnant again.|$|E
