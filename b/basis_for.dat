5|$|A {{trend towards}} greater {{authenticity}} began after Hammond's orchestrations in the 1970s provided a <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> staging {{the work in}} its original form. This process was further aided by the discovery in the 1990s of Bizet's 1863 conducting score. In this, the orchestral parts were reduced to six staves, but notes and other markings in the manuscript provided additional clues to the original orchestration. These new finds became the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> Brad Cohen's critical edition of the score, published by Edition Peters in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Adventure {{received}} mostly positive reviews at {{the time}} of its release and has continued to be viewed positively in the decades since, often named as one of the industry's influential titles. It is considered the first action-adventure and console fantasy game, and inspired other titles in the genres. More than one million cartridges of Adventure were sold, and the game has been included in numerous Atari 2600 game collections for modern computer hardware. The game's prototype code was used as the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the 1979 Superman game, and a planned sequel eventually formed the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the Swordquest games. The Easter egg concept pioneered by the game has transcended video games and entered popular culture.|$|E

5|$|Codex Vaticanus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} manuscripts for the text of the Septuagint and Greek New Testament. It is a leading example of the Alexandrian text-type. It was used by Westcott and Hort in their edition, The New Testament in the Original Greek (1881), and it was the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> their text. All critical editions of the New Testament published after Westcott and Hort were closer in the Gospels to the Codex Vaticanus text than to the Sinaiticus, with only the exception of Hermann von Soden's editions which are closer to Sinaiticus. All editions of Nestle-Aland remain close in textual character to the text of Westcott-Hort, which means Vaticanus was the <b>basis</b> <b>for</b> the translation.|$|E
