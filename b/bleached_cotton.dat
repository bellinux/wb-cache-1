40|$|Hypochlorite and {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{have been widely}} used to <b>bleach</b> <b>cotton,</b> but recently the use of these conven-tional agents, especially sodium hypochlorite (NaClO), has been discouraged owing to their harmful effects on the environment.

40|$|The {{potential}} of ultrasound-assisted {{technology has been}} demonstrated by several laboratory scale studies. However, their successful industrial scaling-up is still a challenge due to the limited pilot and commercial sonochemical reactors. In this work, a pilot reactor for laccase-hydrogen peroxide <b>cotton</b> <b>bleaching</b> assisted by ultrasound was scaled-up. For this purpose, an existing dyeing machine was transformed and adapted by including piezoelectric ultrasonic devices. Laboratory experiments demonstrated that both low frequency, high power (22 kHz, 2100 W) and high frequency, low power ultrasounds (850 kHz, 400 W) were required to achieve satisfactory results. Standard half (4 g/L H 2 O 2 at 90 ºC for 60 min.) and optical (8 g/L H 2 O 2 at 103 ºC for 40 min.) <b>cotton</b> <b>bleaching</b> processes were used as references. Two sequential stages were established for cotton bleaching: (1) laccase pretreatment assisted by high frequency ultrasound (850 kHz, 400 W) and (2) bleaching using high power ultrasound (22 kHz, 2100 W). When compared with conventional methods, combined laccase-hydrogen peroxide <b>cotton</b> <b>bleaching</b> with ultrasound energy improved the whitening effectiveness. Subsequently, less energy (temperature) and chemicals (hydrogen peroxide) were needed for <b>cotton</b> <b>bleaching</b> thus resulting in costs reduction. This technology allowed the combination of enzyme and hydrogen peroxide treatment in a continuous process. The developed pilot-scale reactor offers an enhancement of the <b>cotton</b> <b>bleaching</b> process with lower environmental impact {{as well as a}} better performance of further finishing operations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to extract the antimicrobial agent from Aloe Vera gel with methanol and to investigate the effect of antimicrobial activity of Aloe Vera gel extract on <b>bleached</b> <b>cotton</b> fabric. It is also intended to produce Eco-friendly antimicrobial cotton fabric from Aloe Vera gel extract and to protect the consumer from micro-organisms contamination. Qualitative analysis is carried out to measure the antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive (S. aureus, B. subtilis, B. pumilus) and Gram-negative (Pseudo, Candida, E. coli) bacteria. And then, the physical textile properties of treated and untreated cotton fabrics such as sample width, fabric weight, fabric thickness, fabric count, yarn number, absorbency, abrasion, crease recovery, fabric stiffness and strength are analysed. The results show that the antimicrobial activity of Aloe Vera gel treated fabric is excellent for Pseudo and E-coli, good for B. subtilis and B. pumilus bacteria. But, this antimicrobial agent could not inhibit the growth of S. aureus and Candi. The results also reveal that the antimicrobial Aloe Vera gel treatment does not affect on the properties of <b>bleached</b> <b>cotton</b> fabric...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} thesis that the de-industrialising impact of colonial rule {{explains}} the near-absence of a cotton textile industry in colonial Indonesia. The textile industry stagnated until the 1850 s, grew significantly until World War I and experienced fluctuating fortunes in the 1920 s and 1930 s. Most activity was in the finishing of imported unbleached and <b>bleached</b> <b>cotton</b> cloth. Spinning and weaving were of marginal significance. The high labour intensity of small-scale production, the near-absence of local raw cotton production, and competitive international markets for yarn and cloth precluded domestic production. Boom-bust cycles in international markets and unfavourable real exchange rates discouraged investment in modern spinning and weaving. In the 1930 s, production increased rapidly due to trade protection and technological change in small-scale weaving...|$|E
