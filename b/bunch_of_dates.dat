5000|$|Most notably of the band's touring antics {{during the}} A-Z Series was their 2009 A-Z Tour. The tour {{consisted}} of 26 dates across the United Kingdom, with each tour location based around the alphabet, choosing towns, cities and villages which correspond with letters A-Z. The tour began in Aldershot {{and ended in}} Zennor, gaining significant press coverage because of its uniqueness. Planning the tour bassist Mark Hamilton told eastmagazine.co.uk that the band looked for alternatives to the usual places they would visit on tour; [...] "We told our agent that we don't {{want to go to}} the cities we would usually hit on a regular tour. Then he came back with a <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> <b>dates,</b> but he had quite a lot of work to do on this. But that was good; it was good to make him actually work." [...] going on to say [...] "There were a number of venues we told him to change, saying, ‘We usually play there, so get us something different".|$|E

50|$|Felix was Procurator of Judaea under Claudius. His coins {{bear the}} names of Claudius, Julia Agrippina, Nero (as 'Caesar'), and Britannicus. The obverse of his coins show two shields and two spears crossed, while the reverse shows a six-branched palm tree bearing two <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> <b>dates.</b> The {{depiction}} <b>of</b> military arms on these coins {{would have been a}} constant reminder to the Jews that handled them that they were under the jurisdiction of Rome.|$|R
50|$|Date palms {{can take}} 4 to 8 years after {{planting}} before they will bear fruit, and produce viable yields for commercial harvest between 7 and 10 years. Mature date palms can produce 150 - 300 lb <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> per harvest season, {{although they do}} not all ripen {{at the same time}} so several harvests are required. In order to get fruit of marketable quality, the <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> must be thinned and bagged or covered before ripening so that the remaining fruits grow larger and are protected from weather and pests such as birds.|$|R
50|$|Coponius was {{the first}} Roman Prefect of Judaea, being {{appointed}} in 6 AD when Herod Archelaus, the son of Herod the Great, was deposed and banished to Gaul by Augustus. Coponius depicted the palm tree bearing two <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> on his coinage, which previously had appeared only on extremely rare coins of Herod Antipas. The palm tree design was later used to represent Judaea on coins issued by the Jews during the First and Second Revolts, as well as later Roman-issued Judaean-related pieces.|$|R

60|$|An Arab woman now {{brought in}} refreshments, {{consisting}} of a pillau and sherbet, after which coffee was handed round, and Sidi and Edgar threw themselves down on heaps of blankets for a few hours' sleep. As soon as day broke, the encampment was a scene of bustle and confusion. The women pulled down the tents, rolled up the blankets composing them, and fastened the poles in bundles. Numbers of men scattered to cut <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> <b>dates,</b> and <b>of</b> these huge piles were collected. Three hours later the camels were brought up, and {{men and women alike}} employed in loading them. This occupied over an hour. As soon as it was completed, the women and children took their places {{on the top of the}} burdens, and the camels at once filed off, three abreast.|$|R

"I {{have given}} orders that at daybreak the tents shall be struck, {{and all the}} women and children, with the baggage and as many <b>bunches</b> <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> as the camels can carry, shall start at once for the wells of Azim, seventy miles away. It is a long journey, {{and there is no}} water by the way, so there is no fear of the French following. There are already a hundred of my tents there, for {{although}} this oasis is a large one, being nigh eight miles long and two wide, it is not large enough for the whole of my people. The one at Azim is smaller, but it will support us for a time; and there is an abundance of water for the camels, which number twelve hundred, and the sheep and goats, of which there are about two thousand. A hundred of my men will ride with them as a guard, and to drive the animals.|$|R
30|$|To {{estimate}} {{date palm}} {{contribution to the}} HH income, fresh fruit weight was measured and multiplied with the local price <b>of</b> <b>dates</b> per kg. To determine fresh fruit weight per date palm, the number <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> was counted, from three <b>of</b> them <b>dates</b> were separated from the rachis, weighted, and subsequently average bunch weight was multiplied with the number <b>of</b> <b>bunches</b> per <b>date</b> palm.|$|R

Details of the four steps of the method (installation of the temperature sensor, tagging bunches at the flowering stage, temperature sum calculation and estimation <b>of</b> <b>bunch</b> harvest <b>date)</b> are described. Possible problems are discussed. Results. The application of the method allows drawing a curve of the temperature sum accumulated by the bunches which have to be harvested at exactly 900 degree-days physiological age...|$|R

Noted soul-blues singer Wendy Saddington (formerly of James Taylor Move and Chain) joined as co-lead vocalist in May 1970 and made her recording debut with the band (without St John though) on the intriguingly laid-back, bluesy album Wendy Saddington and Copperwine Live, recorded at the Wallacia Rock Festival in January 1971. In January 1972 St John, never known to be particularly easy to deal with, split from Copperwine; leaving that band, {{at the height of}} its popularity, to continue with ex-Chain and Larry's Rebel Glyn Mason taking over lead vocal duties...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the high}} oil prices the price of asphalt binder has {{increased}} tremendously. This scenario has warranted demand for higher viscosity cheaper asphalt for pavement construction. A {{study was conducted to}} take advantage of the Empty Fruit <b>Bunch</b> (EFB) <b>of</b> <b>Date</b> and Oil Palm trees (which are considered as waste) to produce cellulose fiber to be used as additives in the asphalt binder. If these EFB's could be beneficially utilized in any application, it would reduce the load on the nation's landfills and at the same time reducing the cost of road construction. A total of 11 blends were prepared that consisted of 5 blends with date palm fiber, 5 blends with oil palm fiber and one control sample that contained no fibers. The samples were evaluated using Dynamic Shear Rheometer (DSR) equipment in accordance with the superpave Strategic Highway Research Program (SHRP) requirements. The neat asphalt binders (Unaged), Rolling Thin Film Oven (RTFO) aged and Pressure Ageing Vessel (PAV) samples were then measured for phase angle, shear strain and complex shear modulus and then evaluated in accordance with SHRP requirements. The results indicated that the fibers enhanced the rheological performance of Bio Mastic Asphalt (BMA) blends. The control sample which was categorized as PG 58 was enhanced to PG 76 with 0. 375 % date palm fiber. The oil palm has also improved the blend up to PG 70 with 0. 3 % oil palm fiber...|$|R
