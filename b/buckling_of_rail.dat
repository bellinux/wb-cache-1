40|$|The linear and {{nonlinear}} buckling of curved {{members is}} firstly studied {{to establish a}} theoretical foundation for the buckling of pipelines and rail tracks. The buckling load of circular arches and rings under hydrostatic pressure and funicular arches under compressive loading is estimated. A numerical strategy is developed to investigate the in-plane nonlinear buckling of arches. Shear deformations significantly affect the linear and nonlinear buckling behaviour. The constitutive and equilibrium equations for sandwich circular and funicular arches are also derived as this will be pertinent to the modelling of rail tracks. A new nonlinear solution strategy is presented to investigate the in-plane nonlinear localised lateral buckling of pipelines {{that does not make}} use of any usual assumptions about the buckled and adjoining regions. The critical overall pipeline length for straight pipelines and the critical included angle for circular pipelines are investigated using a localised buckling analysis. If the length or included angle is {{greater than or equal to}} a critical value, any changes to the length or included angle or changes to the boundary conditions do not influence the nonlinear localised buckling results. Both symmetric and antisymmetric localised buckling is studied for straight pipelines. For circular pipelines, the pre-buckling expansion and the post-buckling localised deformations are investigated. The present results are validated by the solutions in the literature and the ANSYS package. A sandwich model is established to investigate the in-plane nonlinear localised lateral <b>buckling</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks including the influence of sleepers and fasteners. The critical track length is investigated for the symmetric and antisymmetric buckling modes. The critical length in the antisymmetric mode is much larger than that in the symmetric mode for the same track configuration, but the safe temperature increments are almost the same for both buckling modes. The use of the fasteners with large rotational stiffness substantially increases the lateral stability of tracks. The safe temperature increment increases linearly with increasing rotational stiffness. An empirical formula is developed for the relationship between the safe temperature increment and the rotational stiffness of the fasteners. The factors that influence the localised lateral <b>buckling</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> tracks are identified in a parametric study...|$|E
40|$|<b>Buckling</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails,</b> {{which often}} accompanies a strong earthquake, is usually due to {{subsidence}} {{of the ground}} or to destruction of the embankments on which the rails lie. Buckling due to these causes is usually gentle, i. e., of large radius of curvature, and occur both in horizontal and vertical directions. There is however another sort of bucklings in which no change of any kind can be discerned in the ground, although the rails are bent sharply into more or less complicated sinuous form. 昭和 10 年台湾中部地震に関する論文及報告　第 1 編　論...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanical}} design of elevator elements is always performed by international standards. The engineer selects the appropriate elements of elevator according to catalogues without knowing scientific details. Therefore, a theoretical analysis is achieved at two operating conditions for guide rails (1) safety gear operation, and (2) running condition with the loads unevenly distributed {{on the elevator}} car. The guide rail is considered a continuous beam with variable supports. Then the British code is listed showing the equations used in it. The theoretical equations showed that guide rails are never subjected to stress in simultaneous combined buckling and bending in the plane, where the bending moment is exerted. It is always a combination of pressure and bending. Consequently, {{it is wrong to}} consider a simultaneous effect <b>of</b> <b>buckling</b> and bending. The equations in the catalogues oppose the theoretical results concerning <b>buckling</b> <b>of</b> guide <b>rails.</b> Therefore, a recommended calculation method for guide rails is presented to be an acceptable method for analysis <b>of</b> guide <b>rail.</b> <br /...|$|R
40|$|As a {{relatively}} environment-friendly transport mode, railways {{have a valuable}} {{role to play in}} mitigating anthropogenic climate change. However, this can only be achieved if railways can adapt to withstand the effects of the increasingly extreme weather associated with climate change. The primary challenge lies in protecting infrastructure from flooding, sea level rise, the effects on earthworks of heavy rainfall and/or drought, <b>buckling</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> in extreme heat and the effects of lightning strikes on signalling systems. This challenge is exacerbated by the extent of railway networks, by the adaptation costs and the variable levels of vulnerability, and by the uncertainties associated with future climate conditions and traffic volumes and values. This emphasises the need for a systematic approach to adaptation, to ensure that the work undertaken is organised and scheduled to maximise the potential benefits arising from the limited funds and resources available. This paper proposes a framework for the segmentation of a railway network, assessment of the economic value of traffic using the network (and thus the economic costs of weather-related disruption), assessment of vulnerability of different segments of the network to the effects of climate change, identification of appropriate remedial measures and their costs, and their prioritisation by means of cost-benefit analysis. The proposed approach provides a comprehensive, prioritised approach to climate change adaptation, reflecting current and anticipated traffic and infrastructure vulnerability, and the varying costs and benefits of different intervention types. Proposed interventions can be prioritised by ranking them in descending order of Benefit-Cost Ratio...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuous}} welded rails used {{in most of}} the United States lack expansion joints of any sort. This {{leads to}} a much smoother ride and a longer service life for rails and wheels, but also causes extreme temperatures to induce high stresses in these rails. In very warm conditions these stresses can incite sudden <b>buckling</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rails,</b> which is dangerous and difficult to predict. To alleviate these risks rail stresses need to be regularly monitored, but current practices are slow and labor intensive. This research develops a non-contact prototype apparatus designed to quickly measure longitudinal stress in rails. The measurement is performed by generating a Rayleigh wave along the surface of the web <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> and analyzing the polarization of the Rayleigh wave some distance further down the <b>rail.</b> An evaluation <b>of</b> this measurement technique is performed on <b>rails</b> <b>of</b> varying age and surface condition in a lab environment.

From these guidelines, a 3 D model is developed to aid in the construction process. Finally, a prototype is manufactured based on this design...|$|R
40|$|<b>Rail</b> is one <b>of</b> {{the oldest}} of our {{mechanised}} transport modes, having been in existence in something resembling its current form for almost two centuries. Since the early 20 th century, its dominant position has largely been ceded to road and air transport, although it has retained a steady volume, if much diminished share, of the overall transport market, with particular strengths in the commuter market in large cities, medium-distance inter-city travel, and bulk freight. In recent decades, the development of high-speed passenger services has enabled rail to compete very effectively with air travel over distances of up to 800 km, and to dominate routes such as London – Paris/Brussels and Paris – Lyon. Similarly, the containerisation of freight services has provided rail with a significant advantage in the intermodal market, as it is very well-suited to the movement {{of large numbers of}} containers between ports and their hinterlands. The issue of climate change remains somewhat controversial, and presents significant political challenges in terms of convincing political leaders and voters that its long-term consequences merit intervention, with the resulting effects on developed-world lifestyles, within the timescale of the typical electoral cycle. However, there is an increasing scientific consensus that the issue and effects of climate change are real, that human activities are a contributory factor, and that efforts are required both to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and to mitigate the effects of climate changes that are occurring now, and are likely to continue to occur for at least decades into the future, irrespective of the efforts made now to reduce greenhouse emissions. The transport sector, including rail, is vulnerable to the effects of climate change and is also a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Rail?s vulnerability takes several forms: constraints on horizontal and, especially, vertical track alignments mean that it is typically more dependent on earthworks than other modes, many of which are now quite old, and are thus vulnerable to increased levels and intensity <b>of</b> rainfall; the <b>buckling</b> <b>of</b> <b>rails</b> under the influence of increased summer temperatures is a problem; and low-lying coastal alignments, such as some of those in the south-west of England, are vulnerable to sea-level rise. However, these issues can be addressed with the necessary interventions and investment, and rail is perhaps less vulnerable than other modes to regulatory intervention to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, since it is relatively energy-efficient and, on electrified routes, can already use renewable energy sources. This paper examines rail?s strengths and weaknesses in the face of climate change, and compares them with those of other, competing transport modes; it then examines the opportunities for, and threats to, rail as a result of climate change, and draws some conclusions about the possible future role and significance of railways...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring the {{longitudinal}} rail movement or rail creep {{is regarded as}} one of the effective ways to understand the rail-stress states in critical locations such as fixed structures (level crossings,turnouts and fixed top bridges), in sags at the bottom of gradients or any track segment with a history <b>of</b> <b>buckles.</b> However, <b>rail</b> stress can be changed due to thermal and mechanical loads in both longitudinal and vertical directions. Many railway companies use a fixed schedule to assess rail creep, particularly in critical locations. This may not be adequate to reduce the risk of summerbuckling and winter pull-apart problems. Current practice of creep measurement does not consider the effect <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> temperature, the vertical movement of track, inherent inaccuracy of the measurement system and any non-uniformity in track structures. In a field test, Total Station Survey equipment has been used to monitor the changes inlongitudinal and vertical displacements <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> at points on a tangent track section in the heavy haul Blackwater system of the QR National network at Edungalba. This 26 tonne axle load track section with 1 % gradient and 60 kg/m rail was instrumented with strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress modules.

30|$|Due to solar radiation, {{temperature}} distribution along the vertical {{direction of a}} simply supported beam bridge section is nonuniform, which would cause warping deformation of bridge. The deformation causes vertical displacement and additional longitudinal force <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> because <b>of</b> the interaction between bridge and track. The increased longitudinal force affects the strength and stability of CWR [5, 6], and vertical displacement <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> causes vertical irregularity, thus affecting the riding comfort of vehicles. In some extreme conditions, the vertical displacement and longitudinal force both become large, and result in <b>buckling</b> <b>of</b> track. Researchers such as Tao et al. [7], Ye et al.

An et al. [11] studied the effect of TDL on the additional expansion and contraction force of CWR.

40|$|<b>Buckling</b> <b>of</b> {{railroad}} track {{continues to}} be problematic for railway engineers and maintenance personnel across all railway networks. Thermal forces are the principal longitudinal load on railroad track. In an effort to ensure track stability under dynamic loads, the magnitude to which longitudinal thermal stresses develop {{is controlled by the}} choice of an appropriate Design Neutral Temperature (DNT). The longitudinal movement <b>of</b> <b>rail,</b> referred to as creep, causes a deviation of the rails’ neutral temperature (RNT) from that of the DNT. It is crucial that the RNT is maintained at or near the DNT to provide the necessary leeway for dynamic traffic loads and ensure lateral stability of the track. However, techniques for monitoring the RNT are very limited and difficult to employ. Railway networks generally rely on preventative measures, such as track strengthening work, to control the risk <b>of</b> <b>buckles</b> occurring. This approach to managing the risk <b>of</b> track <b>buckles</b> is resource hungry and time consuming. This project develops a recursive methodology for identifying situations where the longitudinal movement <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> is likely to result in the accumulation of longitudinal stresses, which is conducive to buckling.
