5|$|Biofuels are fuels {{derived from}} biomass {{conversion}}, {{as in the}} conversion of cellulose contained in corn stalks, switchgrass, and other biomass into cellulosic ethanol. This process is dependent upon microbial consortia that transform the cellulose into sugars, followed by the fermentation of the sugars into ethanol. Microbes also produce {{a variety of sources}} of <b>bioenergy</b> including methane and hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of <b>bioenergy,</b> and solar photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of the technologies reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{renewable}} energy industry supports more than 11,500 jobs in Scotland, {{according to a}} 2013 study by Scottish Renewables. However a 2011 study by 4-Consulting calculated that there was probably a small net loss in jobs in Scotland from government support for {{renewable energy}}. They estimated that the offshore wind industry might create between 300–2,200 long-term jobs by 2020. With 20 GW of renewable energy projects in the pipeline, the sector {{has the potential to}} grow quickly in the years ahead creating more jobs in the region. Glasgow, Fife and Edinburgh are key centres of offshore wind power development, and the emerging wave power and tidal power industries are centred around the Highlands and Islands. Rural job creation is being supported by <b>bioenergy</b> systems in areas such as Lochaber, Moray and Dumfries and Galloway.|$|E
25|$|Typha {{can be used}} as {{a source}} of starch to produce ethanol. Because of their high {{productivity}} in northern latitudes, Typha are considered to be a <b>bioenergy</b> crop.|$|E
25|$|According to The <b>Bioenergy</b> Knowledge Centre, {{the energy}} content of wood is {{more closely related}} to its {{moisture}} content than its species. The energy content improves as moisture content decreases.|$|E
25|$|Biomass {{refers to}} organic matter from plants or animals {{that can be}} {{converted}} to energy. <b>Bioenergy,</b> in turn, is any form of energy (heat or electricity) generated from biomass.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, it {{planned to}} publish a Renewable Energy Review (May 2011), a 3rd Progress Report to Parliament (June 2011), 2nd report on Adaptation (July 2011) and a Review of <b>Bioenergy</b> (November 2011).|$|E
25|$|Of all {{renewable}} electrical {{sources in}} 2012, hydroelectricity represented 57.8%, wind 26%, <b>bioenergy</b> 8.1%, solar PV 8%, large-scale solar 0.147%, geothermal 0.002% and marine 0.001%; additionally, solar hot water heating {{was estimated to}} replace a further 2,422GWh of electrical generation.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture biomass, {{including}} {{agricultural wastes}} and animal manure, produce approximately 30 {{million metric tons}} of dry material per year that could be massively and decisively used, inter alia, for generating <b>bioenergy</b> and {{improve the quality of}} life in rural Egypt. Unfortunately, this resource remain terribly underutilized.|$|E
25|$|The {{dual role}} of biomass as a {{substitute}} for fossil fuels and as a sink for atmospheric carbon is the main advantage for its use in energy generation. <b>Bioenergy</b> production from sustainable biomass sources is considered to be carbon neutral because CO2 emitted during combustion or natural degradation processes is captured by growing plants. Although biomass-based Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) with carbon capture storage (CCS) may be promising technologies for reducing GHG emissions from electricity generating plants, these technologies are small-scale and not well developed in Ontario. The movement in favour of generating <b>bioenergy</b> from municipal waste appears to be a strategy to mitigate trash management; many municipal landfills are approaching capacity. There is a potential to generate income from methane emissions from municipal waste.|$|E
25|$|Branch campuses are in Salina and Olathe. The Kansas State University Polytechnic Campus in Salina {{is home to}} the College of Technology and Aviation. The Olathe Innovation Campus is the {{academic}} research presence within the Kansas Bioscience Park, where graduate students participate in research <b>bioenergy,</b> animal health, plant science and food safety and security.|$|E
25|$|Industry {{has also}} {{developed}} recently around new energy investments and other energies: Bio-fuels (manufacturing site of bioethanol from the AB <b>Bioenergy</b> France Company, €150M investment), biomass (cellulose) {{and the production}} of electricity from gas (production site of SNET, investment of €400M). One driver of uptake and CO2 sequestration process is also underway (industrial investment of €100M).|$|E
25|$|There are {{international}} {{organizations such as}} IEA <b>Bioenergy,</b> established in 1978 by the OECD International Energy Agency (IEA), {{with the aim of}} improving cooperation and information exchange between countries that have national programs in <b>bioenergy</b> research, development and deployment. The UN International Biofuels Forum is formed by Brazil, China, India, Pakistan, South Africa, the United States and the European Commission. The world leaders in biofuel development and use are Brazil, the United States, France, Sweden and Germany. Russia also has 22% of world's forest, and is a big biomass (solid biofuels) supplier. In 2010, Russian pulp and paper maker, Vyborgskaya Cellulose, said they would be producing pellets {{that can be used in}} heat and electricity generation from its plant in Vyborg by the end of the year. The plant will eventually produce about 900,000 tons of pellets per year, making it the largest in the world once operational.|$|E
25|$|The {{laboratory}} is home {{to several}} of the world's top supercomputers including the world's fourth most powerful supercomputer ranked by the TOP500, Titan, and is a leading neutron science and nuclear energy research facility that includes the Spallation Neutron Source and High Flux Isotope Reactor. ORNL hosts the Center for Nanophase Materials Sciences, the <b>BioEnergy</b> Science Center, and the Consortium for Advanced Simulation of Light-Water Reactors.|$|E
25|$|Oak Ridge National Laboratory's {{biological}} research covers genomics, computational biology, {{structural biology}} and bioinformatics. The <b>BioEnergy</b> Program aims {{to improve the}} efficiency of all stages of the biofuel process to improve the energy security of the United States. The program aims to make genetic improvements to the potential biomass used, formulate methods for refineries that can accept a diverse range of fuels and to improve the efficiency of energy delivery both to power plants and end users.|$|E
25|$|Other {{suitable}} heat sources include concentrated solar energy, geothermal energy, nuclear energy, {{waste heat}} and <b>bioenergy.</b> If solar power {{is used as}} a heat source, regular solar mirrors and solar dishes may be utilised. The use of Fresnel lenses and mirrors has also been advocated, for example in planetary surface exploration. Solar powered Stirling engines are increasingly popular as they offer an environmentally sound option for producing power while some designs are economically attractive in development projects.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of a <b>bioenergy</b> industry in Ontario faces many challenges including, but not limited to, high costs owing to the small-scale nature of technologies used to convert biomass to energy and environmental issues (e.g., declining soil productivity and increased fertilizer and pesticides use) related to intensive harvesting of biomass for energy production. That said, research that {{has been carried out}} to address some of these concerns suggests that the adoption of sustainable management practices that aim at maintaining ecological functions of forest and agro-ecosystems may sustain biomass production without adverse impacts to the environment.|$|E
25|$|In {{the last}} decade, Italy {{has become one}} of the world's largest {{producers}} of renewable energy, ranking as the third largest producer in the European Union after Germany and Sweden. The country is also the world's second largest producer of energy from solar power. Renewable sources account for the 27.5% of all electricity produced in Italy, with hydro alone reaching 12.6%, followed by solar at 5.7%, wind at 4.1%, <b>bioenergy</b> at 3.5%, and geothermal at 1.6%. The rest of the national demand is covered by fossil fuels (38.2% natural gas, 13% coal, 8.4% oil) and by imports.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that the world will spend an extra $8 trillion over the next 25 years to prolong the use of non-renewable resources, a cost that would be eliminated by transitioning instead to 100% renewable energy. Research that has been published in Energy Policy suggests that converting the entire world to 100% renewable energy by 2030 is both possible and affordable, but requires political support. It would require building many more wind turbines and solar power systems but wouldn't utilize <b>bioenergy.</b> Other changes involve use of electric cars {{and the development of}} enhanced transmission grids and storage.|$|E
25|$|The {{eucalyptus}} species most planted are E. grandis, E. globulus and E. dunnii; {{they are}} used mainly for pulp mills. Approximately 80,000 ha of E. grandis situated in the departments of Rivera, Tacuarembó and Paysandú is primarily earmarked for the solid wood market, although a portion of it is used for sawlogs and plywood. The current area under commercial forest plantation is 6% of the total. The main uses of the wood produced are elemental chlorine free pulp mill production (for cellulose and paper), sawlogs, plywood and <b>bioenergy</b> (thermoelectric generation). Most of the products obtained from sawmills and pulp mills, as well as plywood and logs, are exported. This has raised the income of this sector with respect to traditional products from other sectors. Uruguayan forestry plantations have rates of growth of 30 cubic metres per hectare per year and commercial harvesting occurs after 9 years.|$|E
25|$|MSU {{implemented}} a 5 {{percent rise in}} student tuition for the 2012-2013 school year, which generated an extra $11 million revenue. Coupled with an extra $4 million in legislative spending and other revenues, the university's 2012-2013 school year budget grew by 9.1 percent to $168.6 million. Another $2.1 million remained unspent, as the university had not yet determined final enrollment figures by September 2012. About $1.2 million of these funds were spent on 16 projects, ranging from hiring student mental health counselors, creating a doctoral program in the College of Nursing, a master's degree in science and nature filmmaking, a sustainable food and <b>bioenergy</b> degree, an Undergraduate Scholars Program to encourage undergraduate research, new equipment and {{an expansion of the}} Taylor Planetarium at the Museum of the Rockies, and an architect to design a renovation of Romney Gym. The Budget Council received requests for funding, held campus-wide meetings to gain student input about them, prioritized them, and sent them to Cruzado for approval.|$|E
500|$|The {{research}} {{also found that}} oil palm would cause the least land-use changes and associated carbon debt. The analysis also modeled livestock density increases and found that [...] "a higher increase of 0.13 head per hectare in the average livestock density throughout the country could avoid the indirect land-use changes caused by biofuels (even with soybean as the biodiesel feedstock), while still fulfilling all food and <b>bioenergy</b> demands." [...] The authors conclude that intensification of cattle ranching and concentration on oil palm are required to achieve effective carbon savings, recommending closer collaboration between the biofuel and cattle-ranching sectors.|$|E
500|$|Renewable energy commercialization {{involves}} {{the deployment of}} three generations of renewable energy technologies dating back more than 100 years. [...] First-generation technologies, which are already mature and economically competitive, include biomass, hydroelectricity, geothermal power and heat. [...] Second-generation technologies are market-ready and are being deployed at the present time; they include solar heating, photovoltaics, wind power, solar thermal power stations, and modern forms of <b>bioenergy.</b> [...] Third-generation technologies require continued R efforts {{in order to make}} large contributions on a global scale and include advanced biomass gasification, hot-dry-rock geothermal power, and ocean energy. As of 2012, renewable energy accounts for about half of new nameplate electrical capacity installed and costs are continuing to fall.|$|E
