40|$|Hedonic pricing {{techniques}} {{can be used}} to generate quantitative information useful to the project appraiser at various stages of the project cycle, most notably project formulation and investment appraisal. To illustrate, a hedonic pricing model is applied to marina <b>berthing</b> <b>charges</b> in England and Wales. The technique determines the relevant marina facilities that are reflected in marina rental price. The contribution of the key marina facilities is expressed in monetary terms as the contribution to cost per overall rental price per foot. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{company also}} faced {{difficulties}} at its home port. The water was not deep {{enough for the}} Great Western to dock at Avonmouth, forcing the ship to anchor midstream. The Docks Company refused to dredge a deeper <b>berth</b> and <b>charged</b> twice the rate as Liverpool. The result was that Bristol lost further ground to it rival ports. After the collapse of British and American, Great Western decided to alternate departures between Avonmouth and Liverpool, before abandoning Avonmouth entirely in 1843. [...] The company remained profitable even though it now competed directly against Cunard's fortnightly service. In 1843, the firm's receipts were ₤33,400 against expenditures of ₤25,600. However, the company was still financially stressed {{because of the cost}} of building the Great Britain, which ultimately reached ₤117,295.|$|R
50|$|Some yachts {{are used}} {{exclusively}} by their private owners, others are operated {{all year round}} as charter businesses, {{and a large number}} are privately owned but available for charter part-time. The weekly charter rate of luxury yachts around the world ranges from tens of thousands to over a million dollars/euros. Expenses of approximately 20-30%, such as food, fuel, and <b>berthing</b> are <b>charged</b> as an extra, called the advance provisioning allowance. The luxury yacht charter industry functions effectively because private yacht owners mitigate their running costs with charter income as well as keeping their yachts and crew in top running order. Conversely, private charterers charter yachts (rather than owning them) because it is generally considered to be less expensive, and less hassle, than owning a yacht and it also provides them with extra choice related to yacht type, location and crew.|$|R
50|$|S. H. Dodwell was {{a nephew}} of George Benjamin Dodwell, founder of Dodwell & Co., {{which was one}} of the leading British {{merchant}} firms in the late 19th and early 20th century. He joined the company in January 1897 and began with a salary of £30 per annum. In 1899 Dodwell became the Company's representative on the Baltic Shipping Exchange, responsible for arranging tonnage to fill Dodwell & Company's turns on the New York <b>berth.</b> He took <b>charge</b> of the firm from his uncle in 1912 and remained as chairman until 1953.|$|R
2500|$|On 23 December 2012, it was {{reported}} that QE2 had been sold for scrapping in China for £20 million, after a bid to return her to the UK was rejected. With monthly <b>berthing</b> and maintenance <b>charges</b> of £650,000, it {{was reported}} that a Chinese salvage crew arrived at the vessel on 21 December, to replace a crew of 40 which has been maintaining the vessel since it arrived at Port Rashid. However, Cunard dismissed the reports as [...] "pure speculation". When the ship was sold in 2007, a clause in the contract which started from her retirement in 2009 stipulated a 10-year [...] "no onward sale" [...] clause, without payment of a full purchase price default penalty.|$|R
40|$|This study {{concentrates}} on the pricing of seaport infrastructure which includes port charges {{on the use of}} access channels and berth facilities. A closer examination of published port tariffs reveals that the port entry and berth use-related port tariffs, often referred to as channel dues and <b>berth</b> occupancy <b>charges,</b> are differentiated based on vessel volume (Gross Tonnage, Gross Registered Tonnage and Length Over All), ship type (container ship, general cargo ship, tanker) and traffic type (foreign-going vessels and coastal vessels). These two charges are one of the main revenue sources for a port authority; however knowledge of the design and imposition of these charges is currently opaque, but nevertheless very useful to port users. This thesis explores the determinants of port infrastructure charges that underpin port pricing policies in world ports. The main objectives of the study are: (a) Identify and conduct an econometric analysis of the effect of various factors on seaport infrastructure charges. (b) To assess the applicability of competing pricing models (pricing approaches) currently used by seaports in different countries and regions in the world. (c) To assess the determinants of port infrastructure tariff design and practices in world seaports and discuss their implications for port management. This thesis brings to notice that, despite the discussion on port pricing theories such as cost-based, market based and cost-benefit theories, the empirical research on this topic remains very limited. Thus, with identified research gaps such as the determination of the level of knowledge that port authorities have in tariff design and their applicability, the thesis investigates the underlying factors influential to the design and practice of port infrastructure tariffs using both quantitative and qualitative research approaches. First, the determinants of port infrastructure charges are studied empirically using data from 159 ports worldwide by employing the ordinary least square and simultaneous equation system method with channel dues and <b>berth</b> occupancy <b>charges</b> as the dependent variables. The result indicates that the pricing of seaport infrastructure is primarily cost-based but other factors are also relevant to the port pricing models currently used by seaports. Among those factors in particular, demand and the type of port management and governance model have been found to significantly impact the level of port infrastructure charges. Second, to complement and triangulate some of the results found in the quantitative model, this thesis examines the primary data collected through an online survey of 67 international seaports to focus on the practical processes and strategic issues in infrastructure tariff design and practice. The questionnaire was sent to higher level seaport managers working in the areas of port tariffs. The contact details of port managers were obtained from the official port websites of respective port organisations. SPSS and AMOS statistical software were employed to analyse the data. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to identify the factors influential to the selection of infrastructure tariff models, the tariff level and the tariff revision process. The results showed that the influential factors in infrastructure tariff design are: a) demand, b) knowledge of pricing theories, c) pricing objectives, d) port cost considerations, and e) dynamics of port and shipping sectors (competition and ship size). Further, an analysis into the factors influential in infrastructure tariff practices of seaports suggested that tariff policies, transparency in tariff setting, tariff regulation and stakeholder participation in tariff affairs are highly significant. Third, the content analysis of two open-ended questions included in the questionnaire to seaport authorities revealed that tariff revision practices vary substantially across ports and regions in the world. Some ports revise tariffs regularly while others seldom do so. Furthermore tariff revision procedures and the parties involved in the process also vary across ports; some ports have highly bureaucratic procedures for tariff revision and others determine their tariff revision decisions independently. Many seaport authorities are not aware of all the basic pricing approaches and their applications, and expressed a wish to receive training and support in tariff design and revision. Based on the results of the quantitative and qualitative analysis, the implications for port management and governments are discussed and, given the exploratory nature of the study, the implications for future research and its limitations are also presented...|$|R
40|$|From merely growing {{shellfish}} and macroalgae {{along the}} freinges of the sea, man is naw growing marine fish in cages thus expanding {{the range of}} mariculture. While the farming of shellfish may have {{its own set of}} problems it is the growing of fish that particularly poses more serious problem. This is especially true since high value fish which invariably are carnivores are the preferred species. Depending on the hydrography of the site, the species culture, culture method, stocking density, feedtype, and husbandry practices marine fish farming has the potential of greatly increasing the organic load of the immediate waters. the use of chemicals such as therapeutants, vitamins, pigments, and anti-foulants futher adds to the pollution. If the rate and manner of development is left to market forces its sustainability may be jeopardized. Areas that are semi-enclosed are often preferred and can rapidly become subject to overcrowding to the extent that its carrying capacity is exceeded. In addition conflicts between growersand other users can arise thus adding a social dimension to the problem. Sustainability of mariculture can be better assured if the development is not haphazard. The concept of zoning and planned development which is now the standard appeoach on land can wery well be applied in the sea. The open waters can be zoned as to type of aquaculture allowable. Beyond zoning, growers can be induced to set up their cages in semi-exposed or even exposed areas where th hydrography is more ideal for growing fish by providing an infrastructure for mariculture. Such infrastructure may consist of nothing more than mooring facilities for deep-watercages and, where necessary, floating breakwaters. With proper spacing of the mooring points, even the density of the cages in an area can be regulated. This will effectively lower start-up cost since growerswill be spared the expense of installing mooring. This will make it possible to broaden the participation to those with limited access to capita such as small-sscale fishers. Users can be charged mooring fees much as ships are <b>charged</b> <b>berthing</b> fees. Service in the form of security may also be provided. this can be complimented by onshor facilities such as a landing area, feed depot, ice plant, cold storage and processing plant. Such an area can be operated like a marine version of an aindusrial park and can aptly be referred to as a mariculture park. This model of mariculture development is being tried in the philippines...|$|R
