50|$|Lack {{of paper}} {{movements}} provides complaint management operations a speed which was never envisaged in manual mode at all. Software allows a <b>booking</b> <b>operator</b> to book and lodge complaints and automatically schedules and prompts operators to source complaint to concerned departments. State {{of the art}} management information reports on complaint details and pending complaints with reasons and remarks provides management a better insight to problems and traffic situations of telephone lines. A never before “Report Wizard” not only allows you to define specific reports on demand but also allows you to define your own sorting and analysis parameters which may be more relevant to you but not programmed by us till now.|$|E
50|$|<b>Booking</b> <b>operators</b> were {{equipped}} with terminals {{that looked like}} a smaller version of the control system, replacing the holes with lamps. They could query the flight status by selecting a flight and then energizing their board. Electricity flowed from their terminal through the selected flight, displaying the status for that flight for all ten days at once. The booking agent could then tell the sales agent the flight status without walking to the cabinet, as well as immediately offer alternatives if it was sold out. The flight card was only updated when the customer actually bought a seat.|$|R

50|$|New South Wales {{is served}} by a fleet of around 6,000 taxis. The {{industry}} employs over 22,000 taxi drivers. The network is largest in Australia. Most taxis are Ford Falcons, Holden Commodores and Toyota Camrys, although {{a smaller number of}} Ford Fairlanes, Holden Statesman/Caprices and Toyota Priuses are in service. In general, taxis are required to run on liquid petroleum gas. In general, individual taxis are owned by small-scale operators who pay membership fees to regional or citywide radio communication networks. These networks provide branding as well as telephone and internet <b>booking</b> services to <b>operators</b> and drivers.|$|R
50|$|In 1946, American Airlines {{installed}} the first automated booking system, the experimental electromechanical Reservisor. A newer machine with temporary storage {{based on a}} magnetic drum, the Magnetronic Reservisor, soon followed. This system proved successful, and was soon being used by several airlines, as well as Sheraton Hotels and Goodyear for inventory control. It was seriously hampered by the need for local human operators to do the actual lookups; ticketing agents would have to call a <b>booking</b> office, whose <b>operators</b> would direct a small team operating the Reservisor and then read the results over the telephone. There was no way for agents to directly query the system.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of ITS, new on-street freight {{delivery}} schemes provide that transport and logistics operator can have suggestions on delivery areas to be used and to book them. Besides, they can also receive suggestions on delivery tours. Thus, time spent for such freight operations can be optimised, and the delivery costs reduced. At the other hand, from city administrator point of view, these new schemes can help the supply of loading and unloading areas to match the demand, and then to reduce the interferences with other city mobility components. The paper aims at presenting a methodology that allows to simulate the real-time management of urban loading and unloading operations (including prior <b>booking</b> by delivery <b>operators)</b> and to compute performance indicators {{that can be used}} for the ex-ante assessment in planning delivery scenarios. The results of an application to the Rome’s LTZ (Limited Traffic Zone) are hence presented. The application has been developed for testing the presented method and to point out the importance of using telematics applications for managing and controlling such operations. Significant results have been obtained according to some management and operations control rules...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} decade the {{attractiveness}} of carsharing increased rapidly, not least because of the introduction of free-floating carsharing in 2009. In those kind of carsharing systems the rental vehicle {{does not need to}} be returned to a particular station but can be parked in any part of the operating area. There have been hardly any empirical findings on the use and effects of free-floating carsharing so far. Thus, this work presents results of user surveys (onCar questionnaire, online survey and discussions with focus groups) with customers of the free-floating carsharing operator DriveNow. Next to the analysis of the user the usage of such a carsharing system is evaluated by booking data of trips in Berlin and Munich from 2013. The Getis-Ord-Gi*-test is used for analyzing the spatial distribution of <b>booking</b> starts. The <b>operator</b> launched 60 electric vehicles in the fleet that makes an additional analysis for this special kind of free-floating carsharing possible. All approaches want to draw an informative picture of a typical free-floating carsharing user on the one side and about how this new mobility service is used in urban areas on the other side. By the discussions in the focus groups one obtains furthermore an impression about the acceptance of electric vehicles by the customers. One clear conclusion is that free-floating carsharing is mostly used by young well-educated people with an over-average income. Two main purposes of the trips are the way home and leisure time activities. The system is well-working in city or district centers while there are considerably less bookings in peripheral areas. This is also correct for electric free-floating carsharing that is principally accepted by the customers...|$|R
