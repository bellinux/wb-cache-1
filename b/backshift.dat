40|$|Abstract. A particle-number {{reprojection}} {{method is}} {{applied in the}} framework of the shell model Monte Carlo approach to calculate level densities for a family of nuclei using Monte Carlo sampling for a single nucleus. In particular we can also calculate level densities of odd-even and odd-odd nuclei despite a new sign problem introduced by the projection on an odd number of particles. The method is applied to level densities in the iron region using the complete pf + g 9 / 2 -shell. The single-particle level density parameter a and the <b>backshift</b> parameter ∆ are extracted by fitting the microscopically calculated level densities to the backshifted Bethe formula. We find good agreement with experimental level densities with no adjustable parameters in the microscopic calculations. The parameter a is found to vary smoothly with mass and does not show odd-even effects. The calculated <b>backshift</b> parameter ∆ displays an oddeven staggering effect versus mass and is in better agreement with the experimental data than are the empirical values...|$|E
40|$|A simple {{formula for}} {{the ratio of}} the number of odd- and even-parity states as a {{function}} of temperature is derived. This formula is used to calculate the ratio of level densities of opposite parities as a function of excitation energy. We test the formula with quantum Monte Carlo shell model calculations in the (pf +g 9 / 2) -shell. The formula describes well the transition from low excitation energies where a single parity dominates to high excitations where the two densities are equal. Typeset using REVTEX 1 Parity is a fundamental property of nuclear levels, and its statistical distribution is important for describing parity-violating processes and neutron-capture reactions. Most theoretical models for level densities are based on the Fermi gas model [1]. Shell corrections and correlations due to residual interactions are included empirically.

In this paper a morphological, behavioral, and electrophysiological investigation of the maxillary palps of Yponomeuta cagnagellus (Lepidoptera: Yponomeutidae) is presented. In addition to thermoreceptors, CO 2 receptors, and gustatory receptors, evidence is reported for the existence of two groups of receptor cells sensitive to plant volatiles. Cells that are mainly sensitive to (E) - 2 -hexenal and hexanal or to (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol and 1 -hexanol were found. Interestingly, a high sensitivity for benzaldehyde was also found. This compound is not known to be present in Euonymus europaeus, the host plant of the monophagous Yponomeuta cagnagellus, but it is a prominent compound in Rosaceae, the presumed hosts of the ancestors of Y. cagnagellus. To elucidate the evolutionary history of this sensitivity, and its possible role in host shifts, feeding responses of three Yponomeuta species to benzaldehyde were investigated. The results confirm the hypothesis that the sensitivity to benzaldehyde evolved during the ancestral shift from Celastraceae to Rosaceae and can be considered an evolutionary relict, retained in the recently <b>backshifted</b> Celastraceae-specialist Y. cagnagellus...|$|R
40|$|In the independent-particle model, {{the nuclear}} level density is {{determined}} from the neutron and proton single-particle level densities. The single-particle level density for the positive-energy continuum levels is important at high excitation energies for stable nuclei and at all excitation energies for nuclei near the drip lines. This single-particle level density is subdivided into compound-nucleus and gas components. Two methods were considered for this subdivision. First in the subtraction method, the single-particle level density is determined from the scattering phase shifts. In the Gamov method, only the narrow Gamov states or resonances are included. The level densities calculated {{with these two}} methods are similar, both can be approximated by the <b>backshifted</b> Fermi-gas expression with level-density parameters that are dependent on A, but with very little dependence on the neutron or proton richness of the nucleus. However, a small decrease in the level-density parameter was predicted for some nuclei {{very close to the}} drip lines. The largest difference between the calculations using the two methods was the deformation dependence on the level density. The Gamov method predicts a very strong peaking of the level density at sphericity for high excitation energies. This leads to a suppression of deformed configurations and, consequently, the fission rate predicted by the statistical model is reduced in the Gamov method. Comment: 18 pages 24 figure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to revisit the problem of tense in English direct and {{indirect}} speech with past reporting clauses. The general point it makes is that in all instances of speech representation, the temporal reference point defined by the ‘original’ speech exchange described in the reporting clause (she said, he thought, etc.) should {{be incorporated into the}} analysis of tense. It creates a second, ‘surrogate’ temporal zero-point within the intensional domain of the represented speaker’s utterances, alongside the real temporal zero-point of the actual speaker’s discourse. Recognition of this intensional domain with its own time of utterance results in an analysis of tense in the reported clause of direct speech as ‘intensionally’ absolute, i. e. as directly related to the time of utterance not of the actual, but of the represented speaker. <b>Backshifted</b> tenses in indirect speech are likewise argued to be ‘intensionally’ relative, involving the represented speaker’s surrogate temporal zero-point which is shifted to a past time of orientation from which relations are subsequently plotted. In addition, indirect speech is shown to occur with two different types of absolute tense use: intensionally absolute tenses similar to those in direct speech, and true absolute tenses in semantically factive examples, where the tense form is related directly to the actual, not the surrogate, time of utterance. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This study {{uses the}} method of corpus {{linguistics}} to investigate a particular grammatical topic in English: Reported Speech. First, presentations of reported speech in seven ESL/EFL (English as a Second/Foreign Language) grammar textbooks are analyzed. The results of the analysis show what information ESL/EFL students currently receive from textbooks about reported speech. Second, a corpus study is implemented to determine how people actually use reported speech in real life. The results of the empirical corpus study represent authentic, naturally-occurring language and reported speech patterns in two registers of American English: Newspaper Writing and Conversation. Third, {{the results from the}} corpus study are compared with the results from the textbook analysis. This comparison establishes {{the extent to which the}} textbooks present real-life reported speech in terms of 1) reporting verbs used, 2) verb tense changes, and 3) register variation. The findings reveal that some aspects of the textbooks 2 ̆ 7 presentations reflect naturally-occurring language and other aspects do not. Most importantly, the empirical corpus findings point to register variation as an essential component in describing reported speech accurately.;Reported speech behaves much differently in the Conversation register than in the News register. Reported speech also occurs more than three times as often in News than in Conversation. The textbooks do not address these register variations. Additionally, in all registers, the verb say emerges as the most common reporting verb, followed by tell. Most other reporting verbs presented in the textbooks are relatively infrequent. The verb tense 2 ̆ 2 <b>backshifting</b> 2 ̆ 2 process advocated in the textbooks occurs in only 50 to 70 percent of reported speech instances. Therefore, the alternative verb tense combinations, Past-Present, Present-Present, and Present-Past occur more frequently than the textbooks claim.

40|$|The Early/Middle Eocene (Ypresian/Lutetian) {{transition}} {{is represented by}} a hiatus in many North European sections, including those in which the classic stratotypes were originally defined. However, the Global Stratotype Section and Point of the Lutetian Stage, which is still pending definition, should be placed at a globally correlatable event included within that unrepresented interval. The Pyrenean Eocene outcrops display sedimentary successions that offer the rare opportunity to analyse the Ypresian/Lutetian boundary interval in almost continuous sections and in very different settings. Seven reference stratigraphic sections were {{selected on the basis}} of their quality and correlated by means of biomagnetostratigraphic data. This correlation framework casts light on the sequence of chronostratigraphic events that characterize the Ypresian/Lutetian boundary interval, which may prove useful in defining the main correlation criterion of the base of the Lutetian. All of the Pyrenean sections show a similar sedimentary evolution, despite being up to 350 km apart from each other, containing deposits of different origins (intrabasinal carbonate sediments, siliciclastic sediments sourced from the Iberian plate, and terrigenous sediments sourced from the uplifting Pyrenees) and despite having been accumulated in different sedimentary environments (from continental to deep marine) and in different geodynamic settings (piggy-back basin, foreland basin and cratonic margin). This common evolution can be readily interpreted in terms of a sea-level driven depositional sequence whose lowstand and transgressive systems tracts are included within the Ypresian/Lutetian boundary interval. The Pyrenean Ypresian/Lutetian depositional sequence can reasonably be correlated with depositional sequences from classic North European areas, shedding light on the palaeoenvironmental history which in those areas has not been recorded. Furthermore, these depositional sequences may possibly correlate with others from the Antarctic Ocean and from New Jersey, as well as with oceanic temperature variations, suggesting that they might be the result of climatically-driven glacioeustatic sea-level changes. Should this hypothesis prove correct, it would confirm previous suggestions that the onset of Antarctic glaciations needs to be <b>backshifted</b> to the late Ypresian at least...|$|R
