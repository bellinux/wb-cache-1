5|$|Some {{philosophers}} take an epistemic {{approach and}} argue that the mind–body problem is currently unsolvable, and perhaps will always remain unsolvable to human beings. This is usually termed New mysterianism. Colin McGinn holds {{that human beings are}} cognitively closed in regards to their own minds. According to McGinn human minds lack the concept-forming procedures to fully grasp how mental properties such as consciousness arise from their causal basis. An example would <b>be</b> <b>how</b> an elephant is cognitively closed in regards to particle physics.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} having an episode {{dedicated}} to The Lone Gunmen arose when the show's producers {{were forced to}} start production of the fifth season {{in the last week}} of August in Vancouver, but still needed series stars David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson for the filming of The X-Files movie in Los Angeles. The producers decided to create an episode dedicated to The Lone Gunmen, and writing duties were assigned to Vince Gilligan. Gilligan initially drafted a story involving nanotechnology, which was rejected by series creator Chris Carter. Carter {{came up with the idea}} for the episode to <b>be</b> <b>how</b> The Lone Gunmen met. Gilligan then developed the script, which took place in the city of Baltimore. The scenes with Duchovny were shot a few weeks after the rest of the episode.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{intensification}} of Patricia was well-anticipated but poorly forecast. Meteorologists at the NHC indicated {{the possibility of}} such in the system's first advisory as a tropical depression. They noted the only inhibiting factor would <b>be</b> <b>how</b> quickly the storm could organize an inner core. Just {{before the onset of}} rapid intensification, the agency was unable to utilize the Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme rapid intensification guidance due to technical errors. This likely contributed to even greater errors in the agency's forecast. Initial forecasts were consistently conservative with intensity and dramatic strengthening was not explicitly shown until rapid intensification was already underway.|$|E

500|$|After the {{remixing}} of {{the songs}} started, Benitez noted, [...] "We decided on basic questions like 'How loud should the drums <b>be?</b> <b>How</b> much should the vocals stand out?' These are creative decisions which will change the finished piece of music." [...] Shep Pettibone, one of the producers of the album commented that [...] "normally, without some music to work on, the remixer has nothing. But we already had Madonna's catalogue of danceable songs which was enough material for lifetime." [...] The mixes on You Can Dance exhibited a number of typical mixing techniques. Instrumental passages were lengthened to increase the time for dancing, which undermined the tighter structure of the original pop song. Vocal phrases were repeated and subjected to multiple echoes, panned across the stereophonic sound outlets. At certain points, almost no music is heard except the drums and at others, the drums are removed with only the hi-hat left to keep time.|$|E

Joe Leonard of 1UP.com noted that the game's humor and over-the-top gameplay help to calm frustrations regarding the difficulty: [...] "Super Meat Boys greatest strength has to <b>be</b> <b>how</b> it never takes itself too seriously—as maddening as some of the levels got, I could never stay angry at the game for too long", said Leonard. MTV Multiplayer reviewer Russ Frushtick praised the game's visual design.

500|$|Writer Novak {{cites the}} episode as the [...] "most conceptually ambitious" [...] in the show's history. More {{than half the}} episode {{consisted}} of footage from the film. Originally, the producers considered showing just the movie, but they felt that it [...] "would feel like a gimmick or experiment", {{and so it was}} decided that the film would be intercut with shots of the office reacting to the film. In order to make the film seem as if Michael had created it, the film used was colorized in post-production to make it seem as if it were of a cheaper quality than the normal high-quality film that the series used. Certain shooting methods, like hand-held and zooms, were nixed, except for in cases where they could be presented in a [...] "poorly-executed" [...] manner. This was done in a way to make it appear that Michael at least knew what he was doing; Novak explained that the crew [...] "didn't want the joke of the episode to <b>be</b> <b>how</b> bad he was at filmmaking" [...] because it would [...] "be a little easy and a little out of character". To create the fake dummy of Toby that exploded, Paul Lieberstein was required to spend several hours in a full-face mold that reportedly [...] "unnerved him greatly". Two molds were taken. Both were filled with explosives, but one was filled with fake blood. Both were shot with slow-motion cameras. However, the dummy with the fake blood in it was considered [...] "too disturbing for us and arguably too disturbing for Michael", and so the tamer explosion was used.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{during the}} 1950s and 1960s {{generally}} regarded the Elegy as powerful, and emphasised its place {{as one of}} the great English poems. In 1955, R. W.

[...] Regarding the status of the poem, Graham Hough in 1953 explained, [...] "no one has ever doubted, but many have been hard put to it to explain in what its greatness consists. It is easy to point out that its thought is commonplace, that its diction and imagery are correct, noble but unoriginal, and to wonder where the immediately recognizable greatness has slipped in." [...] Following in 1963, Martin Day argued that the poem was [...] "perhaps the most frequently quoted short poem in English." [...] Frank Brady, in 1965, declared, [...] "Few English poems have been so universally admired as Gray's Elegy, and few interpreted in such widely divergent ways." [...] Patricia Spacks, in 1967, focused on the psychological questions in the poem and claimed that [...] "For these implicit questions the final epitaph provides no adequate answer; perhaps this is one reason why it seems not entirely a satisfactory conclusion to the poem." [...] She continued by praising the poem: [...] "Gray's power as a poet derives largely from his ability to convey the inevitability and inexorability of conflict, conflict by its nature unresolvable." [...] In 1968, Herbert Starr pointed out that the poem was [...] "frequently referred to, with some truth, as the best known poem in the English language." ...|$|E
