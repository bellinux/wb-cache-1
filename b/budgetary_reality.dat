40|$|A eutrofização de sistemas aquáticos deve-se não só a causas naturais mas também e, principalmente, a actividades antropogénicas, como sejam, as descargas de efluentes domésticos e industriais, a lixiviação e a escorrência de pesticidas e fertilizantes em terrenos agrícolas. As actividades antropogénicas promovem o enriquecimento em nutrientes dos ecossistemas aquáticos, o que favorece o desenvolvimento de organismos fotoautotróficos, como algas verdes, cianobactérias e plantas aquáticas e conduz à deterioração da qualidade das águas. Com este trabalho pretende-se apresentar uma actividade prática, destinada a alunos do Ensino Secundário que frequentem a disciplina de Biologia do 12 º ano de escolaridade. Esta actividade, de metodologia simples e perfeitamente aplicável à realidade {{material}} e orçamental das nossas escolas, permite simular, em contexto de sala de aula, o processo de eutrofização de um recurso de água doce, provocado pelos resíduos resultantes das actividades agrícolas. Finalmente, esta actividade pretende promover o desenvolvimento da literacia ambiental. Desta forma será facilitada a aprendizagem activa dos conhecimentos científicos, a tomada de consciência colectiva sobre o impacto de contaminantes agrícolas na qualidade das águas e reforçar-se-á a necessidade de promover a gestão equilibrada dos recursos e adoptar padrões de produção e de consumo ecologicamente sustentáveis. ABSTRACT: The eutrophication of freshwater systems is due {{not only to}} natural causes, but also and mainly to anthropogenic activities, such as, discharges of domestic or industrial effluents, leaching and runoff of pesticides and fertilizers in agricultural lands, among others. The antropogenic activities promote the enrichment in nutrients of aquatic ecosystems, leading {{to the development of}} fotoautotrophic organisms, as green algae, cyanobacteria and aquatic plants and lead to the deterioration of the quality of waters. The aim of this work is to present a practical activity for 12 th form Biology students. It has a simple methodology given the material and <b>budgetary</b> <b>reality</b> of our schools that allow to simulate, in classroom context, the process of eutrophication of a freshwater resource, caused by agricultural activities waste and, simultaneously, to work on the development of students’ environmental literacy. Active learning of the scientific knowledge will thus be improved, making students aware of the impact of agricultural contaminants on the quality of waters. Moreover, we will try to reinforce the need to promote a balanced management of resources, adopting patterns of production and consumption that are ecologically sustainable.

40|$|Summary. Belgium is on {{the cusp}} of its next defence reform. While the {{security}} landscape throughout Europe’s neighbourhood and beyond deteriorates, the armed forces face numerous challenges. Most importantly, the next defence plan needs to recalibrate the force structure in function of political ambitions and <b>budgetary</b> <b>realities.</b> This Policy Brief argues that Belgium must embrace a nimble but broad-spectrum force. Any future structure must encompass agile land forces as well as a modern combat air force, without neglecting the need to safeguard a sizeable navy and invest in cyber capabilities. European cooperation should be pursued wherever possible while recognising that this necessitates budgetary convergence. For Belgium this means the investment budget needs to grow significantly in order to acquire interoperable but self-owned assets. Such a choice can be justified on the recognition that defence is not just about expeditionary operations, but also economic stimulus, intergenerational solidarity and strategic insurance: maintaining the ability to respond to whatever the future may bring...|$|R
40|$|At {{the heart}} of the {{struggle}} to constitute the 'politics of limits' – the parameters defining the <b>budgetary</b> <b>realities</b> facing governments – is the growing antagonistic relationship between the imperatives of private (financial) markets and public democracies. Through a new analytical instrumentality, this interdisciplinary account problematizes credit ratings and the problem of sovereign debt to show how the authoritative knowledge underpinning the political economy of creditworthiness is constructed through the deployment of the discursive practices of risk and uncertainty. Unpacking the 'black-box' of sovereign ratings, as a socio-technical device of control and governmentality, we better understand how their authoritative capacity/utility are constituted through their performative effects, which create the conditions and subjectivities that serve to validate and regenerate a disinflationary fiscal normality/rectitude. Political judgment is censured through depoliticizing risk techniques; as a (fallacious) analytics of ratings helps elevate quantitative expertise and relegates competing, qualitative approaches in the design of a neoliberal politics of limits. This exacerbates the asymmetry between epistocracy and democracy, which prompts attempts to reclaim lost fiscal sovereignty...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} manned space {{exploration}} {{will be determined}} through a process which balances the innate need of humanity to explore its surroundings and {{the costs associated with}} accomplishing these goals. For NASA, this balance is derived from economics and budgetary constraints that hold it accountable for the expenditure of public funds. These <b>budgetary</b> <b>realities</b> demand a reduction in cost and expenditures of exploration and research activities. For missions venturing out to the edge of habitability, the development of cost effective life support approaches will have a significant influence on mission viability. Over the past several years, a variety of mission scenarios for potential Lunar and Mars missions have been developed. The most promising of these scenarios attempt to provide basic mission requirements at a minimum cost. As a result, these scenarios are extremely power limited. For Closed Environment Life Support System (CELSS) applications, these realities impose both limitations and direction to future research. This paper presents a summary of these mission scenarios and an evaluation of the impact which these power limitations will have on CELSS system design...|$|R
40|$|The {{future of}} the US nuclear arsenal {{continues}} to be guided by two distinct drivers: the preservation of world peace and the prevention of further proliferation through our extended deterrent umbrella. Timely implementation of US nuclear policy decisions depends, in part, on {{the current state of}} stockpile weapons, their delivery systems, and the supporting infrastructure within the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). In turn, the present is a product of past choices and world events. Now more than ever, the nuclear weapons program must respond to the changing global security environment and to increasing budget pressures with innovation and sound investments. As the nation transitions to a reduced stockpile, the successes of the Stockpile Stewardship Program (SSP) present options to transition to a sustainable complex better suited to stockpile size, national strategic goals and <b>budgetary</b> <b>realities.</b> Under any stockpile size, we must maintain essential human capital, forefront capabilities, and have a right-sized effective production capacity.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between budget processes and environmental sustainability outcomes. Design/methodology/approach– This paper presents a detailed case study of the budget process within a not-for-profit institute of technology (Unitec), based in Auckland, New Zealand. Semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} a sample of Unitec’s staff directly involved with preparation of the 2012 annual budget and Unitec’s environmental sustainability strategies. Other data used included publicly available strategy documents, annual reports, news reports, and environmental sustainability action statements. Data collected was assembled using NVivo software to aid analysis. The qualitative analysis was informed by a Foucauldian critical approach to investigate how power is exercised in Unitec’s budget processes in relation to Unitec’s environmental sustainability strategy (ESS). Findings– Insights into the factors which influence <b>budgetary</b> <b>realities</b> and under-resourced ESS rhetoric are provided. A key finding was that power supporting Unitec’s formal budget process is all-pervasive, through the continuance of ‘business as usual’ whereby ESS was denied standing of equivalence to functions that existed prior to the ESS initiatives. The influence of the ESS was confirmed as less financially entrenched notwithstanding Unitec’s determined efforts to promote environmental sustainability as a core value. The paper concludes that the potentially transformative power of the ESS is currently mendicant to budgetary processes that essentially exclude ESS from the inner core of Unitec. Progress is achievable, however, by ESS quantifying in accounting terms the value or payback of its contribution. Originality/Value– An in-depth analysis shows how the disciplinary power of accounting within budget processes influences an organisation’s environmental sustainability outcomes. Since ‘business as usual’ currently operates as a blockage to sustainability outcomes, the path for correction of that impediment lies within environmental sustainability adopting Accounting-based language or an attack on the legitimacy of ‘business as usual’...|$|R

40|$|This article uses post-colonial {{theory to}} examine the cluster of {{international}} human rights known as economic, social and cultural rights. The article surveys the jurisprudence of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, making it relevant for scholars of international human rights as well as post-colonial theory. Traditionally, international human rights divide into two branches: 1) civil and political rights, and 2) economic, social and cultural rights (ESCRs). ESCRs were virtually ignored {{during the cold war}} era, but they now receive expanded attention at the international and regional levels. The creation of the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the mid- 1980 s began this process. The Committee has been highly influential in ESCR norm development. Post-colonialism is a branch of critical theory aimed at exposing the exploitative and paternalistic legacy of the international community 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to former colonies in the developing world. There is a small body of post-colonial theory literature examining international human rights, but it focuses on civil and political rights. The author, a specialist in ESCRs, seeks to engage theorists with another branch of human rights. ESCRs should be of interest to post-colonial theorists because these rights implicate economic national sovereignty, most importantly social spending. Developing country social spending has been uniquely politicized in post-colonial north-south relations through controversies over structural adjustment and trade liberalization. Post-colonial theorists should acknowledge that emerging ESCR jurisprudence and Committee procedures are responsive to north-south concerns on many levels. For example, the Committee 2 ̆ 7 s Concluding Observations concentrate on recommendations rather than on 2 ̆ 2 violations. 2 ̆ 2 This modality permits sensitivity to differential southern <b>budgetary</b> <b>realities</b> while facilitating critique of wealthy egalitarian countries. A second example is that the Committee is progressive, within its limited means, about facilitating participation by 2 ̆ 2 subaltern 2 ̆ 2 southern groups. An important challenge post-colonial theory presents to the emerging ESCR regime is the Committee 2 ̆ 7 s record on encouraging southern governments to protect social welfare spending from external pressure. What does it mean for a country to cut social spending by IMF mandate, incur external debt for large-scale development projects through World Bank, and lower trade barriers pursuant to the WTO, only to be condemned by a UN human rights body for any resulting intensification of hunger, ill health and population displacement? The Committee could adjust its processes to better address this conundrum by routinely pursuing and analyzing information about the status of international negotiations...|$|R
