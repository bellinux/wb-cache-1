5|$|The {{same idea}} of using a DAG to {{represent}} a family of paths occurs in the binary decision diagram, a DAG-based data structure for representing binary functions. In a binary decision diagram, each non-sink vertex is labeled {{by the name of}} a <b>binary</b> <b>variable,</b> and each sink and each edge is labeled by a 0 or 1. The function value for any truth assignment to the variables is the value at the sink found by following a path, starting from the single source vertex, that at each non-sink vertex follows the outgoing edge labeled with the value of that vertex's variable. Just as directed acyclic word graphs {{can be viewed as a}} compressed form of tries, binary decision diagrams can be viewed as compressed forms of decision trees that save space by allowing paths to rejoin when they agree on the results of all remaining decisions.|$|E

In a heterogeneous MDD, each multivalued variable can take different domains. To represent a binary logic function using a heterogeneous MDD, we partition the <b>binary</b> <b>variables</b> into groups with different numbers of <b>binary</b> <b>variables</b> and treat the groups as multivalued variables. Since memory size and APL of a heterogeneous MDD depend on the partition of <b>binary</b> <b>variables</b> {{as well as the}} ordering of <b>binary</b> <b>variables,</b> the memory size and the APL of a heterogeneous MDD can be minimized by considering both orderings and partitions of <b>binary</b> <b>variables.</b> The experimental results show that heterogeneous MDDs can represent logic functions with smaller memory sizes than free binary decision diagrams (FBDDs) and smaller APLs than reduced ordered BDDs (ROBDDs); the APLs of heterogeneous MDDs can be reduced by half of the ROBDDs without increasing memory size; and heterogeneous MDDs have smaller area [...] time complexities than MDD(k) s...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a continuous-time mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model for short-term scheduling of multi-stage multi-product batch plants. The model determines the optimal sequencing and {{the allocation of}} customer orders to non-identical processing units by minimizing the earliness and tardiness of order completion. This is a highly combinatorial problem, especially when sequence-dependent relations are considered such as the setup time between consecutive orders. A common approach to this scheduling problem relies on the application of tetra-index <b>binary</b> <b>variables,</b> i. e. (order, order, stage, unit) to represent all the combinations of order sequences and assignments to units in the various stages. This generates {{a huge number of}} <b>binary</b> <b>variables</b> and, as a consequence, much time is required for solutions. This paper proposes a novel formulation that replaces the tetra-index <b>binary</b> <b>variables</b> by one set of tri-index <b>binary</b> <b>variables</b> (order, order, stage) without losing the model's generality. By the elimination of the unit index, the new formulation requires considerably fewer <b>binary</b> <b>variables,</b> thus significantly shortening the solution time. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.
