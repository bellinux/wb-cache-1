5|$|Despite being right-handed, Ganguly learnt to bat left-handed so {{he could}} use his brother's {{sporting}} equipment. After he showed some promise as a batsman, he {{was enrolled in a}} cricket academy. An indoor multi-gym and concrete wicket was built at their home, so he and Snehasish could practice the game. They used to watch a number of old cricket match videos, especially the games played by David Gower, whom Ganguly admired. After he scored a century against the Orissa Under–15 side, he was made captain of St Xavier's School's cricket team, where several of his teammates complained against what they perceived to be his arrogance. While touring with a junior team, Ganguly refused his turn as the twelfth man, as he reportedly felt that the duties involved, which included organising equipment and drinks for the players, and delivering messages, were <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> social status. Ganguly purportedly refused to do such tasks as he considered it <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> social status to assist his teammates in such a way. However, his playmanship gave him a chance to make his first-class cricket debut for Bengal in 1989, the same year that his brother was dropped from the team.|$|E
5|$|Marquis {{was born}} December 19, 1869, {{on a farm}} near Osceola, Missouri. The family surname came from French {{ancestors}} who had been granted the hereditary title of Marquis. Marquis' great-great-grandfather was disinherited around 1768 for marrying <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> station, to {{the daughter of an}} English merchant. With no prospects in France, he emigrated to Virginia, where he took Marquis as a surname.|$|E
5|$|According to Peter Freuchen, {{the scene}} in which the wolf attacks Mala is real. Freuchen says that Mala, armed with {{a rock and a}} pistol <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> fur jacket, spent three afternoons trying to lure a wolf into attacking him. A rifleman and a cinematographer using a camera with a {{telephoto}} lens followed at a distance. The wolf attack was filmed from far away, with the rifleman ready to shoot the wolf in case Mala was unable to kill it. As shown in film, Mala was able to kill the wolf without using his pistol or relying on the rifleman, and was not injured in the attack.|$|E

5|$|Mega Man is sent by his creator, Dr. Light, {{to defeat}} Dr. Wily and his Robot Masters. Mega Man crushes the eight new Robot Masters and then {{challenges}} Wily himself. During the final fight, Dr. Wily flees into the caves <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> fortress and when Mega Man follows, attempts to trick Mega Man into thinking he is a space alien, but Mega Man defeats the alien revealing {{it to be}} a holographic projection device which malfunctions showing Dr. Wily at the controls. After the scientist begs for mercy, Mega Man spares Wily and returns home.|$|E
5|$|During {{the run of}} Iolanthe, in 1883, Sullivan was knighted by Queen Victoria. Although it was the operas with Gilbert {{that had}} earned him the {{broadest}} fame, the honour was conferred for his services to serious music. The musical establishment, and many critics, believed that this should {{put an end to}} his career as a composer of comic opera—that a musical knight should not stoop below oratorio or grand opera. Sullivan, despite the financial security of writing for the Savoy, increasingly viewed his work with Gilbert as unimportant, <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> skills, and repetitious. Furthermore, he was unhappy that he had to simplify his music to ensure that Gilbert's words could be heard. But paradoxically, in February 1883, just after Iolanthe opened, Sullivan had signed a five-year agreement with Gilbert and Carte requiring him to produce a new comic opera on six months' notice.|$|E
5|$|Evangelis Zappas {{was often}} {{described}} as a solitary and eccentric personality, who had no children. On the other hand, {{he was a man}} of vision, determination and a patriot, who was well aware of the magnitude of his acts. His cousin, Konstantinos Zappas, was the executor of his will and he continued Evangelis Zappas philanthropic works through his legacy. Zappas's wish was to be initially buried in Romania, where he lived most of his life. But after four years his bones were exhumed and reinterred at the school's courtyard in Labovo where he was born, and his skull was enshrined <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> memorial statue outside the Zappeion in Athens, Greece. A ceremony for the interment was held at 10am on 20 October 1888 at the Zappeion. Baron Pierre de Coubertin made a similar gesture by having his heart buried at Olympia.|$|E
60|$|Alton came in {{and dropped}} into a chair which creaked <b>beneath</b> him. <b>His</b> face was {{somewhat}} weary, and the girl noticed the stiffness of his movements. He also looked about him with a curious expression which seemed to suggest reverence in his eyes.|$|R

50|$|As an Electrician First Class, Ausburne manned the {{emergency}} wireless {{station in the}} Army transport , and following the ship's fatal torpedoing October 17, 1917 by U-105, stood to his duty until the ship sank <b>beneath</b> him. <b>His</b> gallantry was recognized in the posthumous award of the Navy Cross.|$|R
5|$|On the German {{side of the}} lines, Voss {{had changed}} clothing. He wore a {{colourful}} civilian silk dress shirt <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> unbuttoned knee-length brown leather coat. His polished brown boots shone from below the coat's hem. His Pour le Mérite was at his throat. He was to lead {{one of the two}} scheduled afternoon patrols. Leutnant Gustav Bellen was his righthand wingman; Leutnant Friedrich Rüdenberg had Voss's other side. After takeoff at 18:05 hours, Voss, with his new Fokker Triplane, advanced its throttle and soon outdistanced his two wingmen flying slower Pfalz D.IIIs. A few minutes later, Oberleutnant Ernst Weigand in Albatros D.V number 1187/17 led a second flight skyward; three Pfalz D.IIIs followed him, piloted by Leutnants Erich Löwenhardt, Alois Heldmann, and Max Kuhn. None of the Jasta 10 aircraft would ever catch their Staffelführer.|$|E
5|$|The {{purchaser}} in the 1888 {{sale was}} John Bullough, a cotton machinery manufacturer (and self-made millionaire) from Accrington in Lancashire, {{who continued to}} use the island for recreational purposes. In the following year, counties were formally created in Scotland, on shrieval boundaries, by a dedicated Local Government Act; Rùm therefore {{became part of the}} new county of Argyll. When Bullough died in 1891 he was buried on Rùm, in a rock-cut mausoleum, under an octagonal stone tower. His heirs, however, felt that this was <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> dignity, and demolished it, moving his sarcophagus into an elaborate mausoleum modelled as a Greek temple. Argyll, similarly, was not thought fitting for Rùm, and that same year was moved by boundary review to the county of Inverness, where Eigg already sat.|$|E
5|$|Voss, an avid motorcyclist, had {{a love of}} {{machinery}} {{that led him to}} consort with his enlisted mechanics, Karl Timms and Christian Rueser; he was even on a first name basis with them. In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a grubby jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E

60|$|He heard a {{brushing}} {{among the}} bushes behind, and {{turning his head}} he saw Elfride following him.

5|$|The dragon man was {{believed}} to be born with some physical peculiarity, such as a caul, little wings or membranes <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> armpits, a tail or teeth; or he was born an orphan. There were practices intended to preserve the supernatural power of the newborn dragon. In the region of Veles, Macedonia, twelve girls would pick cotton, spin yarn from it, weave a cloth from the yarn, made a shirt from the cloth, and finally dress the dragon boy in the shirt. As thought in the region of Leskovac, Serbia, such a boy would only then become able to defeat an ala, when three old women spun yarn, knitted a shirt, and dressed the child in it. All this had to be done in one day and one night, during which time the three women should not have spoken a single word. A similar custom was recorded in western Bulgaria, where it was also believed that the soul of the boy, while he slept in his cradle, left his body and walked around. If he was turned, he would die, as his soul could not return into his body.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} {{the latter half}} of 1942 working in the naval ship yards in Bremerton, Washington, Medicine Crow joined the Army in 1943.

25|$|After {{leaving the}} University of Oklahoma, Cobb {{traveled}} to Mexico, {{where she met}} Rafael Herran Olozaga, who was from a wealthy and politically-connected Colombian family. Both his great-grandfather, Pedro Alcántara Herrán, and his great-great-grandfather, Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera, had served as Presidents of Colombia. His family disapproved of the relationship, considering Cobb <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> station. They were later engaged.|$|E
25|$|Young Mark Twain deserted {{long before}} he became a famous writer and lecturer, but he often commented upon the episode in comic fashion. <b>Beneath</b> <b>his</b> {{desertion}} from a Missouri State Guard unit was his deep unease about losing his personal honor, his fear of facing death as a soldier, and his rejection of a Southern identity as a professional author.|$|E

25|$|During {{excavation}} of Mound 72, a ridge-top burial mound south of Monks Mound, archaeologists found {{the remains of}} a man in his 40s who was probably an important Cahokian ruler. The man was buried on a bed of more than 20,000 marine-shell disc beads arranged {{in the shape of a}} falcon, with the bird's head appearing beneath and beside the man's head, and its wings and tail <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> arms and legs.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Walken played Calvin Webber in {{the romantic}} comedy Blast from the Past. Webber is a {{brilliant}} but eccentric Caltech nuclear physicist whose fears of a nuclear war lead him to build an enormous fallout shelter <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> suburban home. The same year, he appeared as the Headless Horseman in Tim Burton's Sleepy Hollow, starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci. He also appeared in Kiss Toledo Goodbye with Michael Rapaport and Nancy Allen.|$|E
25|$|Rather's {{energy and}} spirit helped him out-compete Roger Mudd for the anchor {{spot on the}} Evening News. Mudd was a more senior {{correspondent}} and a frequent substitute anchor for Walter Cronkite on Evening News. He also anchored Sunday evening broadcast, but it was Rather who traveled through Afghanistan when news led there. A few years into his service as anchor, Rather began wearing sweaters <b>beneath</b> <b>his</b> suit jacket to soften and warm his on-air perceptions to viewers.|$|E
