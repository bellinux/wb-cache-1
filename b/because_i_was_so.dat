5|$|It {{just seems}} like a feel-good record but when you really listen to the lyrics, it's about me growing up. In my household, I didn't go all of the parties and I didn't {{do all the things}} {{that a lot of the}} other teenage girls did <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> in love with my radio and my music. I was so in love with this radio and my parents were happy that I was into {{something}} positive.|$|E
500|$|Weezer {{turned down}} a video {{treatment}} for lead single [...] "El Scorcho" [...] proposed by Spike Jonze, who had previously helped raise the band's status with his videos for [...] "Undone – The Sweater Song" [...] and [...] "Buddy Holly". Cuomo explained: [...] "I really don't want the songs to come across untainted this time around... I really want to communicate my feelings directly and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> careful in writing that way. I'd hate for the video to kinda misrepresent the song, or exaggerate certain aspects." [...] The final video featured the band playing in an assembly hall in Los Angeles, surrounded by light fixtures flashing {{in time to the}} music. Mark Romanek, the video's director, quit after numerous arguments with Cuomo, leaving Cuomo to edit the video himself. The video debuted on MTV's 120 Minutes and received moderate airplay.|$|E
500|$|Burton {{revealed}} that Dylan is [...] "a lot more" [...] like himself. [...] "Jason was so stoic and didn't {{really get to}} show a lot of personality, unless it was with Spinelli or Sam," [...] he said. Dylan {{has a sense of}} humor, and the actor felt that it would bring out a [...] "lighter side" [...] of his acting. In addition to his [...] "entire makeover" [...] which included a new hairstyle, Burton lost weight to play Dylan, as the costume department wanted him to look younger. Burton admitted during an interview with Entertainment Weekly that he was worried about how Dylan would be received, considering the [...] "persona" [...] of Jason is out there; he hoped [...] "people will buy" [...] Dylan, although some people would say [...] "You are Jason and that's it." [...] Burton told Yahoo! that: [...] " [...] extremely different. That's the biggest thing for me, that after playing a character, which I loved, for 21 years, coming here and trying to do something different - 'cause I know fans are always gonna see me as that character if they watch the show and if they watch both shows... So, it's definitely a challenge <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> used to playing that character." [...] Jason's [...] "confined" [...] ways allowed Dylan to have a [...] "little more" [...] of Burton's own personality.|$|E

500|$|After {{three years}} with Celtic, in July 2004, Nécib was {{selected}} to attend the CNFE academy at Clairefontaine. She initially struggled to adapt at the center admitting [...] "the first year was really hard <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> far from my family. I almost gave up". However, after developing a rapport with future international teammates Sarah Bouhaddi, Élodie Thomis, Laure Boulleau, Jessica Houara, and the aforementioned Pizzala, Nécib quickly returned to the form that got her selected to the center. The CNFE academy is allowed participation in the French women's football league system and, from 2002–2007, fielded a team that participated in the Division 1 Féminine. Nécib spent two seasons with the team and made her league debut on 29 August 2004 against Lyon. In the match, she scored the only goal, a 90th-minute winner, in a 1–0 win. Nécib finished the campaign with 20 league appearances and six goals. Four of her six goals came {{in the final four}} weeks of the season. On 26 March 2005, she scored a double in a 4–2 defeat to Juvisy. A week later, she scored the only goal in a win over Olympique Saint-Memmie and, on the final match day of the season, she scored the team's fourth goal in a 5–1 win over Lyon. CNFE ultimately finished the campaign in 5th-place position. In the following season, Nécib appeared in 18 matches and scored three goals, all of which came in victories.|$|E
500|$|Casting {{began in}} October 2008 with Downey's signing. Though Don Cheadle was also {{reported}} to be reprising his Iron Man 2 role of War Machine for The Avengers, he later stated {{that he did not}} think the character would appear in the film. At the same time, two major prospects occurred for Marvel: Jon Favreau was brought in as an executive producer for the film, and the company signed a long-term lease with Raleigh Studios to produce three other big-budget films—Iron Man2, Thor (2011), and [...] (2011)—at their Manhattan Beach, California complex. Lou Ferrigno, who voiced Hulk in The Incredible Hulk, stated that he would be involved in the film. In February 2009, Samuel L. Jackson signed a nine-picture deal with Marvel Entertainment to play Nick Fury in Iron Man2 and other films. In September 2009, Edward Norton, who played Bruce Banner in The Incredible Hulk stated that he was open to returning in the film. The next month, executive producer Jon Favreau stated that he would not direct the film, but would [...] "definitely have input and a say". Favreau also expressed concerns, stating, [...] "It's going to be hard, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> involved in creating the world of Iron Man, and Iron Man is very much a tech-based hero, and then with Avengers you're going to be introducing some supernatural aspects because of Thor... the two of those works very well in the comic books, but it's {{going to take a lot}} of thoughtfulness to make that all work and not blow the reality that we've created". In March 2009, actress Scarlett Johansson replaced Emily Blunt in portraying Natasha Romanoff in Iron Man 2, a deal that subsequently attached her to The Avengers. The female superhero Wasp was included in an earlier draft of the script written before Johansson's involvement. The following day, Marvel announced that the film's release date had been pushed back to May 4, 2012, almost a full year later. Chris Hemsworth and Tom Hiddleston joined the film's cast in June, returning as Thor and Loki, respectively.|$|E
500|$|Azaria played {{composer}} Marc Blitzstein in Tim Robbins' film Cradle Will Rock in 1999. Paul Clinton {{wrote that}} Azaria was [...] "brilliant as the tortured (is {{there any other}} kind) artist Blitzstein." [...] The same year he appeared as author and journalist Mitch Albom alongside Jack Lemmon in the television film Tuesdays with Morrie, winning the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Miniseries or a Movie for the role. Azaria described the latter as the [...] "best work [...] done." [...] These {{were two of the}} first dramatic roles Azaria had taken; throughout his career Azaria has primarily worked in comedy, but tries to balance the two. Azaria commented: [...] "all the roles I got were in comedy at first, and I was certainly happy to get those, so I never felt the lack of being considered a dramatic actor <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> happy to get what I got. And then I became surprised later on when I got dramatic roles. But I never went, 'OK, now it's time to get a dramatic role.'" [...] His next dramatic part was in the television film Uprising in 2001. The film was based on the 1943 Warsaw Ghetto Uprising and Azaria played Mordechaj Anielewicz, one of the revolt's leaders. Azaria was confused by his casting in Uprising and frequently asked the film's producer and director Jon Avnet why he was selected. [...] "I know [...] liked the fact I was Jewish, and he knew I could do accents well. He cast me and David Schwimmer in , and we were both sort of mystified. He had some instinct that he wanted people who were more known for being funny. He never explained it satisfactorily to me; I don't understand why." [...] His parts in Tuesdays With Morrie and Uprising affected him, causing a depressive state which he countered with DVDs of the comedy series Monty Python. Azaria found Uprising to be [...] "very difficult very depressing very emotionally challenging" [...] material. In 2003, Azaria played journalist Michael Kelly, the former editor of The New Republic, in the drama film Shattered Glass. Kelly died a few months before the film was released and Azaria said the film [...] "has become a weird kind of eulogy to him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bow {{attended}} P.S. 111, P.S. 9, and P.S. 98. As {{she grew}} up, she felt shy among other girls, who teased {{her for her}} worn-out clothes and [...] "carrot-top" [...] hair. She said about her childhood, [...] "I never had any clothes. ... And lots of time didn't have anything to eat. We just lived, that's about all.

We got along, and we were kind of friendly, and actually, after I met her the first time, she asked me if I wanted to be her band leader. But the Nazz had just signed a record contract and I couldn't skip out on the band, even though it was incredibly tempting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hirst gave up {{smoking and}} {{drinking}} in 2002, although the short-term result was that his wife Maia [...] "had to move out <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> horrible." [...] He had met Joe Strummer (former lead singer of The Clash) at Glastonbury in 1995, becoming good friends and going on annual family holidays with him. Just before Christmas 2002, Strummer {{died of a heart}} attack. This {{had a profound effect on}} Hirst, who said, [...] "It was the first time I felt mortal." [...] He subsequently devoted a lot of time to founding a charity, Strummerville, to help young musicians.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1945 he gained the Conservatoire's first prize in harmony. In the autumn he entered Simone Plé-Caussade's fugue class, {{but he was so}} infuriated by what he {{described}} as her [...] "lack of imagination" [...] that he boycotted the class and organized a petition that Messiaen be given a full professorship in composition. In the winter of 1945/46 he was introduced to Balinese and Japanese music and African drumming at the Musée Guimet and the Musée de l'Homme in Paris: [...] "I almost chose the career of an ethnomusicologist <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> fascinated by that music. It gives a different feeling of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Friedrich {{worked at}} a record store in Cape Girardeau, Missouri after high school, and in February 1964, {{obtained}} a job at Jackson's two weekly newspapers, which were being combined into a single twice-weekly. [...] "I was working about 80 hours a week for $50", he recalled in 2001. [...] "I wrote, edited, and laid out the entire newspaper. I was the whole editorial staff without any help. It was driving me crazy". Friedrich had gotten married the year before and by now had a young son, but, [...] "I didn't have time for anything because I was working all the damn time." [...] The marriage fell apart, [...] "and even that wasn't {{a major problem for}} a while <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> damn busy and I was either working, drunk, or both", Friedrich said, alluding to the alcoholism from which he began recovering on [...] "New Year's night in 1979".|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson shares five co-writing credits on Piece by Piece, as she {{explained}} her pregnancy prevented her from writing more material. She recalled: [...] "It {{was the first}} time I didn't really feel inspired, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> sick, but I didn't feel like writing anymore. The big difference for this recording was collecting from other writers I'm inspired by." [...] The album opens with [...] "Heartbeat Song", produced by Greg Kurstin and written by Kara DioGuardi, Jason Evigan, Audra Mae, and Mitch Allan. Clarkson described the track as a song that could have fit on Stronger but was a little more progressive, and said that the track serves as a bridge connecting Stronger to Piece by Piece. Produced by Jesse Shatkin, [...] "Invincible" [...] follows as the second song of empowerment, written by Sia, Shatkin, Steve Mostyn, and Warren Felder. Clarkson had originally intended the song to be recorded as a duet with Sia, but RCA ultimately decided to keep Sia's vocals uncredited to avoid competition with her studio album 1000 Forms of Fear (2014), as both were on the same label. The last song recorded for Piece by Piece, Shatkin sent the song to Clarkson, saying: [...] "Sia and I just wrote this song and you've gotta hear it. I know you're finished with the record but you've gotta hear it", to which she quickly agreed. The third track, [...] "Someone", is a non-apology apology song written by Matthew Koma and produced by Kurstin. [...] "Take You High", the fourth track, was written with Mozella and produced by Shatkin, who described it as [...] "an electronic banger" [...] and [...] "a little left-of-center", but also having a haunting melody that he thought Clarkson was attracted to.|$|E

2500|$|In 2006, Mikkelsen starred {{opposite}} Stine Stengade and Jana Plodková in Ole Christian Madsen's award-winning film Prag (Prague). His role as Christoffer {{earned him}} the Zulu Award for Best Actor and Bodil and Robert Festival nominations for Best Actor. Eddie Cockrell of Variety noted his [...] "rigid countenance" [...] in an [...] "outstanding" [...] performance. The same year, Mikkelsen achieved his first widely acclaimed international success as Le Chiffre in the twenty-first James Bond film, Casino Royale. Mikkelsen {{has said that he}} so easily won the part that even Daniel Craig asked him if he had slept with someone in order to be cast. He said of the casting, [...] "They'd done their homework, seen my stuff, so it was fine, just a bit of anti-climax, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> ready to do more for them, but it was … shrugs... you're in." [...] He also stated that because he was already a big film star in Denmark at the time, that the international role did not really change much. Roger Ebert noted the suspense during Mikkelsen's scene with Bond during the extended poker game, in which Le Chiffre weeps blood from his left eye. David Edelstein of New York Magazine said [...] "Mikkelsen clicks his rectangular plaques as if he's a new breed of praying mantis. He's bloodcurdling." [...] In 2006, Mikkelsen also took the lead role in the Danish drama After the Wedding, which earned an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Film. He won the Palm Springs International Film Festival Award for Best Actor and a European Film Award for Best Actor nomination for his performance. The New York Times remarked that on the Hollywood scene, Mikkelsen has [...] "become a reliable character actor with an intriguing mug" [...] but stated that on the domestic front [...] "he is something else: a star, an axiom, a face of the resurgent Danish cinema." ...|$|E
