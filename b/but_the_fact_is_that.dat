25|$|It {{may seem}} a vast {{depletion}} of the downtown shopping area, it now having only one department store, the Hudson's Bay Company. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> for many years, until {{the arrival of the}} Hudson's Bay Company there were only two department stores downtown, Simpson's and the discount department store on Broad Street — the wholesale wing of Simpson's and Sherwood Department Store being outside city centre. Reaching a balance between convenience for residents of Regina and the desire to make the city appealing and impressive is not a novelty.|$|E
500|$|The two French sailors {{that reached}} Leander {{immediately}} began a systematic pillaging of the British officers' personal effects. Rather than tossing the men into the sea, as historian William James suggests {{they should have}} done, Thompson instead ordered one of the British boats to be repaired and launched to transport him to the French ship and bring back Captain Lejoille {{in the belief that}} he would end the looting. However, when the French captain arrived he immediately joined his officers, commandeering all but two of Captain Thompson's shirts and the wounded officer's cot. When Captain Berry complained that a pair of ornamental pistols had been stolen from him, Lejoille summoned the thief to the quarterdeck and took them for himself. The sailors who accompanied Lejoille were equally voracious: among the many things taken were the ship surgeon Mr Mulberry's operating tools, stolen {{in the middle of an}} operation. Without the correct equipment, the surgeon could not assist the many wounded, including Captain Thompson, who had a musket ball still embedded deeply in his arm. When Captain Berry complained, Lejoille replied [...] "J'en suis fâché, mais le fait est, que les Français sont bons au pillage" [...] ("I'm sorry, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the French are good at plunder").|$|E
500|$|Speer {{managed to}} reach a {{relatively}} safe area near Hamburg as the Nazi regime finally collapsed, but decided on a final, risky visit to Berlin to see Hitler one more time. Speer stated at Nuremberg, [...] "I {{felt that it was}} my duty not to run away like a coward, but to stand up to him again." [...] Speer visited the Führerbunker on April22. Hitler seemed calm and somewhat distracted, and the two had a long, disjointed conversation in which the dictator defended his actions and informed Speer of his intent to commit suicide and have his body burned. In the published edition of Inside the Third Reich, Speer relates that he confessed to Hitler that he had defied the Nero Decree, but then assured Hitler of his personal loyalty, bringing tears to the dictator's eyes. Speer biographer Gitta Sereny argued, [...] "Psychologically, it is possible {{that this is the way}} he remembered the occasion, because it was how he would have liked to behave, and the way he would have liked Hitler to react. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> none of it happened; our witness to this is Speer himself." [...] Sereny notes that Speer's original draft of his memoirs lacks the confession and Hitler's tearful reaction, and contains an explicit denial that any confession or emotional exchange took place, as had been alleged in a French magazine article.|$|E

At his {{memorial}} at Columbia University's St. Paul’s Chapel, Paul Elie, another editor said, [...] "It {{is tempting}} to float an analogy between his death {{and the death of}} a certain kind of publishing. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> his kind of publishing was rare in his own time, and so was he.".|$|E

[...] The toll was due to be cut to £5.40 in 2017 but actually increased further.|$|E

Journalist Dave Scherer of PWInsider wrote: [...] "Sting is an all timer for sure, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{when he was}} the man in WCW, even before the NWO came in, he didn't draw huge". Pro wrestling {{historian}} Dave Meltzer also reported that Sting was not a formidable draw. Fin Martin of Power Slam felt that while Sting did not make [...] "essential improvements" [...] nor [...] "grow into the champion's role" [...] during his first NWA World Heavyweight Championship reign from 1990 to 1991, he suffered from a weak line-up of potential opponents and poor creative handling. Martin said that Sting never truly established himself as 'The Man'.|$|E

2500|$|In early 1983, Mitchell began a world tour, visiting Japan, Australia, Ireland, the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy and Scandinavia {{and then}} {{going back to the}} United States. A {{performance}} from the tour was videotaped and later released on home video (and later DVD) as Refuge of the Roads. As 1984 ended, Mitchell was writing new songs, when she received a suggestion from Geffen that perhaps an outside producer with experience in the modern technical arenas that they wanted to explore might be a worthy addition. British synthpop performer and producer Thomas Dolby was brought on board. Of Dolby's role, Mitchell later commented: [...] "I was reluctant when Thomas was suggested because he had been asked to produce the record , and would he consider coming in as just a programmer and a player? So on that level we did have some problems... He may {{be able to do it}} faster. He may be able to do it better, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it then wouldn't really be my music." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the battle}} Thompson was joined aboard the Leander by Captain Edward Berry, and sent with Nelson's despatches to Gibraltar. [...] Whilst sailing there, they were spotted on 18 August by the Généreux, which had escaped the Battle of the Nile. The French pursued the Leander. Being a 60 gun ship to the Généreux′s 78, and still having battle damage and men wounded from the Nile, Thompson {{attempted}} to escape, but was eventually forced {{to come to}} battle. The two eventually clashed in a long running engagement, which eventually resulted in Leander being disabled and unmanageable. [...] After conferring with Berry, Thompson agreed to surrender. The Généreux had suffered 100 killed and 188 wounded, to the Leander′s 35 killed and 57 wounded. [...] Arriving on board the French ship, Berry and Thompson were almost immediately stripped of their possessions. The French went on to plunder their prize, even {{going so far as}} to steal the surgeon's equipment as he tried to attend to the wounded. [...] When Thompson protested, and reminded the French captain of how French prisoners were treated under Nelson, he received the reply 'I am sorry for it; <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> the French are expert at plunder.' ...|$|E
