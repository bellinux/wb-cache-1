This article compares four alternative charging mechanisms and outlines responses to these alternatives by farmers and plant breeders. Risk‐averse farmers and breeders are shown to have opposite preferences for charging mechanisms. Results suggest profit‐based or royalties are preferred by farmers whereas breeders prefer area or tonnage‐based royalties. Risk‐sharing arrangements between both parties could lead to an overall preference for profit‐based or royalties. However, this finding is subject to important caveats and practical limitations.

30|$|It was {{interesting}} to note that locally-based seed companies/distributors were significant drivers determining the numbers of seed cultivars in Europe. Alternative <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations</b> also can increase farmers’ choice and seem to be increasingly popular in the three non-adopting countries that also tend to be those countries where organic production is growing most rapidly. In Austria and Switzerland, organic agriculture has now surpassed 18 %i and 11 %j of the agriculturally used area, respectively. Hence, efforts are now being made to breed cultivars for organic farmers’ needs. For example, the Germany-based multinational “KWS Saat AG”, which is a major breeder of GM varieties, has also established a successful organic breeding program and offers organic maize cultivars in Germany and Austria.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the crop}} variety {{information}} from <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations</b> promotes {{the positive aspects of}} varieties included, rather than a grower specific view. The grower needs to take into account across all the new varieties improved germplasm traits when making cropping decisions. Data mining techniques offer opportunities for summarising diverse data into a coherent format which is understandable by growers. Data mining offers opportunities to improve the process of identifying and recommending new varieties as it can facilitate the analysis of multiple information sources. Data mining can provide both the crop breeder and grower with a more translucent view of the general trends in the performance and other plant traits of new varieties...|$|R

50|$|In animals the {{progeny testing}} could be {{conducted}} in a large herd or involving associated herds or {{in the field in}} farmers place. The field based progeny testing is highly required when the selected bulls are to be distributed in a large area, to many farmers in different environments. Conducting a field based progeny testing esp. in small holder production systems of Asia and Africa require huge resources both financial and infrastructural - a large AI network, robust and dynamic data collection and analysis system. Usually the breeding companies conduct progeny testing of their bulls {{so that they can be}} commercially promoted. But when the <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations</b> are Government controlled (eg.India), the onus of conducting the testing also lies with them if required genetic improvement is to be achieved.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the major}} {{livestock}} breeding organizations {{in the world are}} actively involved in using the emerging tools for genome analysis to obtain {{a better understanding of the}} molecular architecture of their favourite production traits. This is bound to generate a considerable amount of novel biological information that will provide a competitive advantage to those that have access to it. At present, the preferred avenue to exploit this information is via marker-assisted selection (MAS), and several <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations</b> are starting to implement MAS in breeding programs. However, it seems unlikely that the exploitation of genomics information will be limited to MAS in the future. Even though it is difficult to anticipate the ultimate impact of genomics on animal production, it would be very surprising if it were not to revolutionize this industry as it is already revolutionizing the biomedical and plant breeding industries...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} for pedigree errors during the numerous stages involved in tree breeding and deployment is large. Molecular fingerprinting has great {{potential for}} quality control, {{an example of this}} application is presented here. During the grafting stage of a Eucalyptus nitens breeding program the labels identifying 37 different ramets were mistakenly removed. The aim of this project was to use molecular markers to fingerprint genotypes to correct this mistake. Based on RAPD fingerprinting data, most ramets (34 out of 37) were successfully assigned to an ortet (scion source for grafting). Three of the ramets could not be assigned to an ortet. These probably represent errors during the collection of scion material or samples for DNA analysis or maybe during the grafting operations. Fingerprinting technology is now well established and should be used by tree <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations</b> and companies deploying improved trees in their plantations for quality control...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Spotted {{cattle breed}} {{is the most}} common breed in Austria. Austrian Spotted cattle breed is bred as a dual purpose breed for more than 100 years. The {{breeding}} objective has changed over the time according to the different economic importance of the traits and according to the diffe-rent possibilities in using estimated breeding values (EBVs) for selection. Since 1998 the breeding objective is defined as the aggregate genotype of production traits and functional traits. All economically important traits are combined according to their economic weights in the total merit index (TMI). The TMI is calculated by combining the EBVs of all traits using a selection index procedure. The index weights (b-values) are estimated depending on the reliabilities of the EBVs and are therefore different from animal to animal. Considering the intensive international exchange of semen from the best bulls, the cooperation in the breeding programs and the similar economic situation in agriculture the <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations</b> of German...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to introduce the national data management and QTL analysis system for dairy cattle in Germany, developed for genotyping labs and <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations.</b> SYSTEM COMPONENTS Administration of marker data. A part of the system is intended to manage continuously updated molecular data used in routine genotyping. An analysis of marker data comprises: identifying marker allele transmission errors, calculation of statistics characterising quality of particular markers, and reconstructing marker haplotypes. Data analysis. Traits currently screened for QTL comprise daughter yield deviations (DYDs) for lactation specific and for overall milk, fat, and protein yields, and somatic cell scores. The computational steps involved are: the calculation of QTL probabilities, simultaneous QTL detection and evaluation of breeding values based on a series of univariate mixed inheritance animal models, evaluation of selected multivariate models chosen based on univariate results, selection of those QTL, which inheritance is to be followed in bulls. Interchange and update of information. An important function of the system is to control flow of information between the national databases for dairy cattle and between end-users. Th...|$|R

40|$|Title of the paper: Examinations {{using the}} results of {{breeding}} value estimation for Holstein sires and cows in Germany Besides for selection purposes, estimated breeding values {{can be used to}} analyze genetic trends and structures in populations. Using data of 2, 440, 261 cows from four regions in Germany, genetic trends for all cows under test (registered and grade) were calculated for the period of birth years 1992 to 1999. For milk, fat, and protein yield annual trends on average were 111 kg, 3. 2 kg, and 3. 3 kg, respectively. An analysis of the use of proven sires revealed that a relatively large proportion of bulls get second crop daughters. Most of them, however, are used in a very limited way. The differential use of sires by breeders besides production is highly influenced by type proofs although in this respect clear differences exist between regions. An analysis comparing first proofs of young bulls with their later proofs based on additional second crop daughters for all German Holstein <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations</b> showed a high degree of agreement between the two proofs. However, this analysis was based on only 127 sires that were used more widely (plus > 500 second crop daughters) ...|$|R

40|$|Fertility of stallions is of high {{economic}} importance, {{especially for}} large <b>breeding</b> <b>organisations</b> and studs. <b>Breeding</b> schemes {{with respect to}} fertility traits and selection of stallions {{at an early stage}} may be improved by including molecular genetic markers associated with traits. The genes coding for equine cysteine-rich secretory proteins (CRISPs) are promising candidate genes because previous studies have shown that CRISPs {{play a role in the}} fertilising ability of male animals. We have previously characterised the three equine CRISP genes and identified a non-synonymous polymorphism in the CRISP 1 gene. In this study, we report one non-synonymous polymorphism in the CRISP 2 gene and four non-synonymous polymorphisms in the CRISP 3 gene. All six CRISP polymorphisms were genotyped in 107 Hanoverian breeding stallions. Insemination records of stallions were used to analyse the association between CRISP polymorphisms and fertility traits. Three statistical models were used to evaluate the influence of single mutations, genotypes and haplotypes of the polymorphisms. The CRISP 3 AJ 459965 :c. + 622 G>A SNP leading to the amino acid substitution E 208 K was significantly associated with the fertility of stallions. Stallions heterozygous for the CRISP 3 c. + 622 G>A SNP had lower fertility than homozygous stallions (P = 0. 0234). The pregnancy rate per cycle in these stallions was estimated to be approximately 7 % lower than in stallions homozygous at this position...|$|R

In contrast, in the current world it is common to state the breeding values for dressage, jumping, exterior and sometimes also physical dimensions with the sport horses. Mostly are these breeding values completed with a graph. That is why the breeding values for linear features of the exterior description together with the graph adequate to these values were complemented into the design of the cold-blooded stallions catalogue, so that the breeders can compare individual stallions and choose the most suitable one.
