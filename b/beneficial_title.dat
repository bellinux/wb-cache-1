2500|$|Repudiation of {{absolute}} <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> of all lands: The majority in Mabo also rejected {{the proposition that}} immediately upon the acquisition of sovereignty, absolute beneficial ownership of all the lands of the Colony vested in the Crown. The majority rejected the traditional feudal development {{of the doctrine of}} tenure as inappropriate for Australia, and rather saw that upon acquisition of sovereignty the Crown acquired not an absolute but for [...] a radical title, and that title would be subject to native title rights where those rights had not been validly extinguished. Thus the court accepted that a modified doctrine of tenure operated in Australia, and that the law of tenure (as a product of the common law) could co-exist with the law of native title (as a product of customary laws and traditions), though where there had been a [...] valid grant of fee simple by the Crown the latter title would be extinguished.|$|E
50|$|However, no real steps {{have been}} taken {{in any of those}} jurisdictions to address the {{fundamental}} conceptual issues of where the <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> to the trust assets should be regarded as residing whilst they form part of the trust fund. Arguably, if no other person is regarded as having a beneficial claim to the assets, they would be regarded as being owned solely by the trustees, which could have disastrous tax implications for the trustees.|$|E
50|$|The Court of Appeal {{held that}} the {{transfer}} took place in March, meaning the taxes were not due. Although legal title passed to the claimants only when the shares were finally registered by the company, the <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> passed as soon as Mr Rose completed the share transfer forms. Once he did this he was {{not at liberty to}} merely cancel the transfer, and so when he handed away the forms, the shares were held on constructive trust.|$|E
50|$|However, {{the rights}} and {{obligations}} of any third party holder of the assets shall remain subject to the law determined by the choice of law rules of the lex fori. Thus, although the Convention makes provision for the trustee(s) and any third parties, it fails to address {{the position of the}} beneficiaries who, for example, might wish to pursue assets intermixed with the trustee's personal property through actions for tracing. One of the problems that beneficiaries might encounter is addressed in Article 12 which considers the problem where the situs law does not have a title registration system which reflects ownership registration in a representative capacity. While recognising that the Convention cannot require states to modify their existing registers, it provides that the trustee shall be entitled, in so far as this is not prohibited by or inconsistent with the law of the State where registration is sought, to do so in his capacity as trustee or in such other way that the existence of the trust is disclosed. This implicitly recognises the desirability of all registration systems distinguishing between <b>beneficial</b> and representative <b>titles.</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examined the}} experiences and challenges that Title IX coordinators face at small and medium-sized private institutions. Since the Dear Colleague Letter of 2011, the position of Title IX coordinator has changed significantly and the expectations to aggressively address campus violence have increased. Through {{the use of an}} online questionnaire and semi-structured interviews with Title IX coordinators, this study explored the specific challenges they face in their positions, especially if they have another full time role at their institution. Furthermore, I explored their paths to this position and what professional experiences they utilize in these roles. Lastly, I determined how they collaborate with the campus community on their campus and other Title IX coordinators on other campuses. 	I found that Title IX coordinators face great challenges in their roles and because 12 out of 13 in this study had another full time role, these challenges varied greatly. Some of the challenges that the Title IX coordinators face are lack of time, lack of financial resources, difficultly setting up a solid infrastructure, and challenges with the highly emotional topics and decisions. Even though there are a large number of challenges associated with being a Title IX coordinator, I found that collaborations with stakeholders on campus are extremely <b>beneficial</b> to <b>Title</b> IX work. Other sources of support include access to legal council and upper administration, which was largely due to the political capitol they had on their campus. 	The Title IX coordinators that also held other positions on their campuses noted a lack of intersection of those positions in most cases. The largest lack of intersection between the Title IX coordinator role and their other position was in the area of student interaction. Those that rarely interacted with students on a regular basis found it difficult to relate to students and understand student development. However, there were benefits to the multiple roles for those that did have regular student interaction as well as those that read policy and conducted investigations on a regular basis. 	This dissertation examined the role of Title IX coordinators and revealed several recommendations for how the position can be improved for those that hold multiple roles on their campuses. Implications for Title IX administrators and recommendations for those charged with addressing sexual misconduct with limited resources and time are also addressed...|$|R
50|$|A {{bearer stock}} certificate, {{as its name}} implies is a bearer instrument, and {{physical}} possession of the certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the stock. Bearer stock certificates are becoming uncommon: they were popular in offshore jurisdictions for their perceived confidentiality, and as a useful way to transfer <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> to assets (held by the corporation) without payment of stamp duty. International initiatives have curbed the use of bearer stock certificates in offshore jurisdictions, and tend to be available only in onshore financial centres, although they are rarely seen in practice.|$|E

5000|$|Registry of Scripless Securities (RoSS) is the {{official}} record of absolute ownership, legal or <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> or interest in GS. Upon award of GS to a GSED at the auction, the securities award record are downloaded electronically into the GSED’s Securities Principal Account in RoSS. Every sale of GS by a dealer reduces its Securities Principal Account in RoSS. Conversely, every purchase of GS by a GSED increases its Securities Principal Account in RoSS. The ownership/interest of secondary market buyer, trustee, pledgee, etc. of GS is recorded in the Securities Client Account in RoSS. The recording is done by merely keying-in the trade at the respective BIS terminals of the trade counter-parties and within seconds the trade information is received by the RoSS. At the end of trading hours, all matched trades (confirmed by both counterparties) are referred to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) for settlement (debit of GSED buyer and credit of GSED seller Demand Accounts). This completes the process of trading in the secondary market. This effectively conforms with the G-30 Recommendations of Delivery-versus-Payment (DvP) through Netting but Same-Day-Settlement.

40|$|Family {{property}} {{is a primary}} area of contention in property law. If spouses only have rights in relation to property to which they can show legal or <b>beneficial</b> <b>title,</b> they may be left unprotected {{in the event of}} marital breakdown, despite what may be a lengthy and considerable contribution to family life. If spouses have automatic rights to one another 2 ̆ 7 s property, injustice may result where no contribution (financial or familial) has been made. Should the law provide for property redistribution, as opposed to maintenance? If a property interest is to be granted, how, and by whom, is such an interest to be quantified...|$|E
40|$|The article {{seeks to}} {{examine the effect of}} a {{severance}} of a joint <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> following the House of Lords' ruling in Stack v Dowden [2007] 2 AC 432. If, under Stack, the parties' beneficial interests fall to be treated as identical to their legal interests (in effect, giving rise to a joint tenancy both at law and in equity), how does the mechanism of severance of a joint beneficial tenancy actually operate so as to give rise to separate and unequal shares where the parties' common intention has changed by virtue of post-acquisition events? The question is examined by reference to an ambulatory and new constructive trust, as well as where the parties have entered into an express declaration of trust of their beneficial interests...|$|E
40|$|It {{is clear}} from the {{decision}} in Wik Peoples and Thayorre People v Queensland that the grant of a pastoral lease does not create a full legal reversionary interest in the Crown and is, therefore, insufficient to expand the Crown’s underlying radical title. The cases discussed in this paper, however, focus on a very different exercise of sovereign power: whether legislative vesting of property in the Crown can, without more, confer <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> upon the Crown. Although there are various legislative regimes which generally purport to vest property in the Crown, this paper will focus on two specific examples of legislative vesting which relate directly to land. The first, considered in Part I, deals with the various legislative regimes which contain express declarations of Crown ‘property’ in minerals. The second, examined in Part II, deals with express legislative vesting of resumed land in the Crown...|$|E
40|$|The {{fiction of}} terra nullius¹ is {{addressed}} in Mabo & Ors v The State of Queensland (No 2) (Mabo) (1992) 175 CLR 1. However the increasing commodification of water {{has raised the}} issue of whether a new form of indigenous dispossession is now subtly occurring. When the Crown abrogates its <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> in favour of private parties through Crown grants, it is now a legal maxim that any underlying Indigenous property rights are extinguished or at least diminished to the extent of the grant. Since 2000, the granting of exclusive rights of access to water in the various States’ water legislation, has arguably also extinguished or at least diminished surviving Indigenous water property rights. Scant research into this impact suggests that the uncrystallised quantum of compensation that may be attributable {{as a result of the}} granting of such private access rights has been deftly underestimated by policy makers...|$|E
40|$|This two-part article {{examines}} the juridical nature of radical title: does it confer full and unfettered <b>beneficial</b> <b>title</b> except {{to the extent of}} native title, or is it a bare legal title? Part 1 explained that, contrary to the received view. the leading Privy Council and American authority in this context supported the latter interpretation. In Part 2 it is shown, also contrary to the orthodox view, that not only is New Zealand authority directly relevant {{in the context of an}} inhabited settled colony such as Australia, but that such authority also supports the inchoate nature of the Crown's property rights upon acquisition of sovereignty It is also shown that, even before the High Court's fundamental restatement of the common law as it applies to Australia in Mabo, the High Court had described the nature of the title acquired by the Crown upon settlement as something less than a full proprietary estate underlying any pre-existing title. Nevertheless, the Mabo High Court attributed authority for the proposition that ownership of unalienated land which is not subject to native title must lie with the Crown since there is 'no other proprietor' to Stephen CJ in Attorney-General (NSW) v Brown. It is explained, however, that not only is this aspect of the decision in Attorney-General (NSW) v Brown incorrect in law, but more importantly, the Court's reason for rejecting defense counsel's argument - that the Crown did not have any property in the waste lands of the colony of New South Wales - can be distinguished post-Mabo...|$|E
