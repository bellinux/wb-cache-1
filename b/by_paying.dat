5|$|During the Eastern Han, peasants {{could avoid}} {{the month of}} annual conscripted labor <b>by</b> <b>paying</b> a tax in {{commutation}} (gengfu 更賦). This development went {{hand in hand with}} the increasing use of hired labor by the government. In a similar manner, because the Eastern-Han government favored the military recruitment of volunteers, the mandatory military draft for peasants aged twenty-three could be avoided <b>by</b> <b>paying</b> a tax in substitution.|$|E

5|$|As governor, Wickliffe's {{primary concern}} was the Panic of 1837. He {{advocated}} raising property taxes to offset spending deficits that had climbed to $42,000 by 1839, but the legislature borrowed money to meet the current expenses instead. Wickliffe maintained the state's credit <b>by</b> <b>paying</b> the interest due on state securities. The only areas where he called for more spending were improvements in river navigation, preservation of state archives, and public education. Aside from these concerns, he was inundated with requests for clemency.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian's edicts {{emphasized}} the common liability of all taxpayers. Public records of all taxes were made public. The position of decurion, {{member of the}} city council, had been an honor sought by wealthy aristocrats and the middle classes who displayed their wealth <b>by</b> <b>paying</b> for city amenities and public works. Decurions were made liable for any shortfall {{in the amount of}} tax collected. Many tried to find ways to escape the obligation.|$|E
5|$|Following Franklin's retirement, she {{and several}} other retired female faculty members filed a class action lawsuit against the University of Toronto {{claiming}} it had been unjustly enriched <b>by</b> <b>paying</b> women faculty less than comparably qualified men. In 2002, the lawsuit was settled when the university acknowledged that many of its female professors had suffered from gender barriers and pay discrimination during their careers. As a result, about 60 retired women faculty received a pay equity settlement intended to compensate them for the lower salaries and pensions they had received.|$|E

5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school events, or trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded <b>by</b> <b>paying</b> attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E
5|$|Gan also {{founded a}} school for the poor {{in the village of}} Sam-toh in Fujian, China, where his forefathers were born, and helped to finance and {{maintain}} the Tranquerah Chinese Free School in Melaka.

5|$|By {{the time}} of the fall of Constantinople, the only {{remaining}} territory of the Byzantine Empire was the Despotate of the Morea (Peloponnese), which was ruled by brothers of the last Emperor, Thomas Palaiologos and Demetrios Palaiologos. The Despotate continued on as an independent state <b>by</b> <b>paying</b> an annual tribute to the Ottomans. Incompetent rule, failure to pay the annual tribute and a revolt against the Ottomans finally led to Mehmed II's invasion of Morea in May 1460. Demetrios asked the Ottomans to invade and drive Thomas out. Thomas fled. The Ottomans moved through the Morea and conquered virtually the entire Despotate by the summer. Demetrios thought the Morea would be restored to him to rule, but it was incorporated into the Ottoman fold.|$|E

5|$|Finally, in 1260, Hasan-Jalal {{decided to}} ally {{himself with the}} forces of the Georgian king David Narin, who was leading an insurrection against Mongol rule.

The insurrection eventually failed and under the orders of Arghun Khan, Hasan-Jalal was arrested once more and taken to Qazvin, (now in Iran). According to Kirakos Ganzaketsi, Rhuzukan appealed to the Hulagu Khan's wife Doquz Khatun, to pressure Arghun to free her father. However, as Arghun Khan learned of this, he had Hasan-Jalal tortured and finally executed. Hasan Jalal's son Atabek ordered several of his men to Iran to retrieve his father's dismembered body, which had been tossed into a well; upon bringing it back, the body was given a proper funeral and buried at Gandzasar monastery.|$|E
