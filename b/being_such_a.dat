I don't know. It's really great collaborating with her and Natalia is such a great writer.|$|E

One might also note that the wedge-tail is the largest Australian bird of prey, which may reflect the founder's early aspirations of La Trobe being a large and prominent university within Australia.|$|E

25|$|Many {{temperate}} {{fish have}} specific local diet requirements, while others, will eat {{just about any}} crustacean or frozen foods. Some fish should not be kept with fish {{small enough to fit}} into its mouth, crabs or mollusks. Similarly some crabs can not be kept with some mollusks, while other fish, crabs, mollusks and echinoderms may be compatible with each other. It takes experience before one can successfully gauge the compatibility of the fish and invertebrates in one's area.

This however was met a cool reception for <b>being</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> slim portfolio.

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the 20th century, wealthy {{individuals}} started choosing to reside in low tax jurisdictions to reduce their taxable income. Gibraltar <b>being</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> jurisdiction attracted these wealthy individuals. In the 1930s refugees of extreme political regimes sought sanctuary for their goods and assets in Gibraltar. Asset holding and protection still continues in Gibraltar and usually involves trust companies with low taxation. Gibraltar functions as an offshore financial centre. Offshore companies in Gibraltar became popular during the blockade and provided business for lawyers and accountants. Gibraltar used to offer offshore companies a 25-year guarantee against income and estate taxes. This aspect of Gibraltar influenced nationality in that it allowed high-net-worth individuals to be granted residence on a discretionary basis.|$|E

25|$|Melbourne Victory– The long-standing {{historical}} contempt held by many Western Australians {{toward their}} eastern state neighbours, {{as well as}} a scorn for anything Victorian has culminated in an especial rivalry with the Melbourne Victory Football Club. The distaste felt by many Glory fans toward the Victorians can largely be put down to the greater bitterness felt by Western Australians toward the Eastern states in regard to matters of politics, culture and indeed other sports, especially Australian Rules Football. Western Australian's often perceive their state to be 'forgotten' in matters of national interest, {{largely as a result of}} the state <b>being</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> distance from the main population and political centres of the country; a factor which can also be said to result in Western Australians being some of the more parochial people in Australia. This hatred of the eastern states can be said to focus upon Melbourne Victory in the A League as Victory are the biggest and most successful club on the Eastern seaboard. Another reason for the hate towards Melbourne Victory is due to Besart Berisha, who was awarded a controversial penalty in the dying minutes of the 2012 Grand Final.|$|E
25|$|With optimal {{ripeness}} {{and balance}} between acidity and sugars <b>being</b> <b>such</b> <b>a</b> viticultural priority for Chenin blanc, many growers (such {{as those in}} the Loire Valley) will harvest the grapes in tries or successive pickings through the vineyards. During each series of picking only the ripest clusters or individual grapes are harvested by hand during a period that could last four to six weeks and include three to six passes through the vineyard. For the production of sweet botrytized wines, pickers will look for the grapes that have achieved the necessary amount of the noble rot. In hot and dry years where no noble rot occurs, pickers may leave ripened grapes on the vine long enough to shrivel, or passerillé, where it could later be effected by noble rot. In areas that experience a lot of vintage variation, winemakers may decide on a day by day basis what style and dryness of Chenin blanc they could make, with the grapes harvested during each tries going to different styles of wine. For some producers in Vouvray, which may have up to six tries during harvest, the first few tries could go to sparkling and dry wine production while the later tries could go towards sweet wine production.|$|E
