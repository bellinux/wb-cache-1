5|$|Over 300 {{species of}} birds have been sighted in the park {{including}} the calliope hummingbird, the smallest bird species in North America, as well as trumpeter swans, which is North America's largest waterfowl. In addition to trumpeter swans, another 30 species of waterfowl have been recorded including blue-winged teal, common merganser, American wigeon and the colorful but reclusive harlequin duck which is occasionally spotted in Cascade Canyon. Both bald and golden eagles and other birds of prey such as the osprey, red-tailed hawk, American kestrel and occasional sightings of peregrine falcon have been reported. Of the 14 species of owls reported, the most common is the great horned owl, though the <b>boreal</b> <b>owl</b> and great grey owl are also seen occasionally. A dozen species of woodpeckers have been reported, as have a similar number of species of warblers, plovers and gulls. The vocal and gregarious black-billed magpie frequents campgrounds while Steller's jay and Clark's nutcracker {{are found in the}} backcountry. The sage covered plains of Jackson Hole are favored areas for sage grouse, Brewer's sparrow and sage thrashers, while the wetlands are frequented by great blue heron, American white pelican, sandhill crane and on rare occasions it's endangered relative, the whooping crane.|$|E

40|$|<b>Boreal</b> <b>owls</b> Aegolius funereus (referred to as Tengmalm’s owls in Europe) {{breed in}} boreal forests {{throughout}} the Holarctic region and in high-elevation subalpine forests further south. They are currently classified as seven subspecies; six found throughout Eurasia, {{and one in}} North America. The geographic distribution of <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> in North America and Eurasia is similar, as are their patterns of dispersal and irruption. Because a recent genetic study of <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> in North America found very little genetic differentiation among widely disparate locations, we expected that <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> in Eurasia similarly would have very little genetic differentiation. Using seven microsatellite markers, we analyzed genetic samples from 275 <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> in North America, 36 in Norway, and five in eastern Russia. We found no detectable genetic differentiation between Norwegian and Russian owls, but notable differentiation between North American and Eurasian owls. Low intra-continental genetic differentiation likely results from high rates of long-distance dispersal among subpopulations of <b>boreal</b> <b>owls.</b> In light of these results, we recommend further genetic sampling of <b>boreal</b> <b>owls</b> throughout Eurasia {{in order to determine}} whether six separate subspecies here are warranted...|$|R

50|$|The <b>boreal</b> <b>owl</b> breeds {{in dense}} {{coniferous}} forests across northern North America and Eurasia, and in mountain ranges {{such as the}} Alps and the Rockies.

5000|$|The <b>boreal</b> <b>owl</b> (Aegolius funereus) {{is a small}} owl. In Europe, it is {{typically}} known as Tengmalm's owl after Swedish naturalist Peter Gustaf Tengmalm or, more rarely, Richardson's owl after Sir John Richardson. The scientific name is from Latin.

30|$|Four female <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> in our study, however, {{decreased}} brooding {{and increased}} foraging {{in response to}} the absence or low feeding rates of males during the early brooding phase (i.e., {{at a time when the}} young needed both brooding and food provisioning). These females left their nest for as long as several hours per night, and sometimes came back to the nest with food. Therefore, it is likely that these females attempted to hunt to compensate for the insufficient feeding rates of their mates. However, these females stopped providing at an early stage of the brooding period when the oldest young averaged 11.8 days of age, and thus nesting attempts failed (i.e., our second prediction).|$|R
30|$|Sex-specific parental {{roles of}} most raptors allow mates to {{cooperate}} during breeding; while females incubate and brood, males provide food. If one partner fails in its parental duties, however, sex-specific parental roles can limit {{the ability of}} each sex {{to carry out the}} role normally performed by its partner. We observed the effect of male food provisioning on female parental care in <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls</b> Aegolius funereus using cameras at 12 nests in western Finland in 2005. We compared the parental care of eight females in nests with a high male feeding rate (successful nests) with that of the females in four nests with a low or zero male feeding rate (failed nests).|$|R
30|$|Our {{study was}} {{conducted}} in April to July 2005 in the Kauhava region of western Finland (63 °N, 23 °E; elevation 50 to 110 m), an area of about 1, 300 km 2. Habitats consisted of a mosaic of boreal forests, mainly Norway spruce Picea abies and Scots pine Pinus sylvestris, agricultural fields, and peatland bogs. During 2005, 470 nest boxes were present in our study area, and 75 (16 %) were occupied by <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls.</b> Most nest boxes were square-shaped with an inner width range of 17 to 22 cm, a height of 50 to 60 cm, and a diameter of the opening of 8 to 10 cm (Korpimäki 1984).

50|$|The {{northern}} hawk-owl {{feeds on}} a variety of prey, which can include small rodents to mammals more robust in size, and a variety of birds, a typical diet for many <b>boreal</b> <b>owls.</b> In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl is known to feed primarily on voles from the Microtus family. These voles usually follow a 3-4 year cycle of abundance. Therefore, S. u. ulula numbers are affected negatively when the numbers of voles are lowest. In North America the subspecies S. u. caparoch also feeds upon microtine voles, but its population is primarily based on the ten year cycling of the snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus). In Eurasia the northern hawk-owl's biomass consists of about 94% microtine voles, whereas in North America the percentage of biomass contributed by voles can be as low as 20%. Juvenile hares are considerably more important at 40-50%.|$|R
30|$|Male {{and female}} parental care was {{recorded}} using a camera system at 12 nests (16 % of the 75 nest boxes used by <b>Boreal</b> <b>Owls)</b> from 21 April to 14 July. In {{order to identify}} parents (i.e., tagging), we caught males by placing a 10 × 10 × 25 -cm wooden trap {{in front of the}} opening of the nest box (Korpimäki 1981). We caught and identified 7 of 12 males. Females were caught in their nest boxes by closing the entrance hole by hand or with a long-handled net during the brooding period (mean, 9.4 ± 3.8 days after hatching of the oldest young). We ringed, weighed, and determined the age of all females using the molt pattern of primary feathers (as 1, 2, 3 years old, or 'older than 3 years’ as described in Hörnfeldt et al. 1988; birds older than 3 years were counted as 4 years old in computing the average female age).|$|R
50|$|Northern saw-whet owls lay {{about five}} or six white-colored eggs in natural tree {{cavities}} or woodpecker holes. The father does the hunting while the mother watches and sits on her eggs. Females can have more than one clutch of eggs each breeding season with different males. Once the offspring in the first nest have developed their feathers the mother will leave the father to care for them and go find another male to reproduce with. This type of mating is sequential polyandry. They compete with <b>boreal</b> <b>owls,</b> starlings and squirrels for nest cavities and their nests may be destroyed or eaten by those creatures as well as nest predators such as martens and corvids. Saw-whet owls of all ages may be predated by any larger species of owl, of which there are at least a dozen that overlap in range. They are also predated by Accipiter hawks, which share with the saw-whet a preference for wooded habitats with dense thickets or brush.|$|R
