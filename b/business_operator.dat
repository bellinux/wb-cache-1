40|$|Albanian Food Law Nr. 9863 dt. 28. 01. 2008 {{defines the}} {{requirements}} for all the food <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> (ex-cept primary one) to have in place a self-control sys-tem based on HACCP methodology. In Albania there is not any official regulation yet, which can define clearly and systematically what the Albanian food <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> should document and imple-ment referring to the HACCP model. So {{to be on the}} safe side most of the food operators are asking for con-sultancy and certification against ISO 22000 : 2005. But those which are certified and more others which plan to do it perceive this model as quite complex for them. This paper reveals other FSMS for the food <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> to apply except ISO 22000 : 2005, and finds out if those systems are really less complicated and more suitable for them. The methodology used are in-quiries, interviews with food <b>business</b> <b>operators,</b> food safety literature, results, inductive and deductive type of results presented in narrative and tabular way. Convulsions are that also the other FSMS systems ex-cept ISO 22000 : 2005 can be implemented and certi-fied from the Albanian food <b>business</b> <b>operators.</b> But similar to ISO 22000 : 2005, those FSMS are perceived from them as complex ones as well. In reality all these systems require a certain level of technical and man-agement documentation and technical know-how. So the reasons to choose one or another FSMS rely mostly not on the complexity of those systems (as they all are complex), but on the business objectives of the food <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> and their specific client and partner needs...|$|R

40|$|A {{shortage}} of suitable franchisee applicants {{has been identified}} by franchisors as a major hindrance to franchise sector growth in Australia. However, {{there has been little}} investigation into this issue within organisational choice research. This represents an important gap in the literature. In order to explore the issue of franchisee shortage, it was necessary to determine why individuals chose to enter franchising as a franchisee or why they chose to become small independent <b>business</b> <b>operators.</b> Interviews with 10 franchisees and 10 independent small <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> were conducted in Brisbane, Australia. The interviews investigated the characteristics of franchisees and independent small <b>business</b> <b>operators,</b> and looked for differences between the two groups. Whilst their risk profiles were similar, franchisees were less likely to conduct much research prior to making a business choice. Franchisees considered ongoing support, the provision of training and a proven system with established processes to be very important. Alternatively, independent small <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> preferred to exercise absolute control over their businesses, relying on knowledge and skills gained in prior employment and valuing their independence. Franchising appeared to offer the dual benefits of facilitating entry into business in an unfamiliar industry for inexperienced operators as well as providing a vehicle for growth and expansion for investors with previous corporate management experience. Opportunities for franchisors to attract independent <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> include addressing the negative image attached to franchising and demonstrating that the franchise system is not restrictive for entrepreneurs.

40|$|There is much {{evidence}} in the literature that small business growth has long been regarded as critically important for the economy and for employment growth. This paper focuses initially on an analysis of tbe impediments to business growth identified from the survey responses of small businesses in the western metropolitan region of Melbourne. From the survey information 25 small businesses were then selected for case study analysis to further examine the nature of impediments to growth and to examine how innovative and successful small <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> dealt with these impediments. A number of common impediments were identified, especially problems accessing finance, getting the right employee skills and the low use of support services. Analysis of the case studies yielded some insights as to: how successful small <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> deal with such impediments or obstacles to their innovation and growth; {{the low level of}} awareness and expectations small <b>business</b> <b>operators</b> generally have of the support programmes and services currently available to them; the nature of support small businesses would like to have to overcome perceived impediments to growth; strategies needed to successfully engage small businesses in support initiatives and to encourage innovation and growth. The findings have significant implications for small business development initiatives, including the provision of management training and support for small <b>business</b> <b>operators...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{consensus}} {{from many}} years {{of research in the}} small and medium enterprise (SME) sector {{is that it is a}} very diverse group.
