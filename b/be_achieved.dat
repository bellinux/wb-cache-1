5|$|At the University of Birmingham in Britain, the Australian {{physicist}} Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists— Frisch and Rudolf Peierls—the task {{of investigating}} {{the feasibility of}} an atomic bomb, ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar. Their March 1940 Frisch–Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium-235 was within {{an order of magnitude}} of 10kg, which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day. Research into how uranium isotope separation (uranium enrichment) could <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> assumed enormous importance. Frisch's first thought about how this could <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> was with liquid thermal diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> by {{different}} methods, described below. Most {{of the methods}} contribute to crypsis, helping to hide against a background; but mimesis and motion dazzle protect without hiding. Methods may be applied {{on their own or}} in combination.|$|E

5|$|Human {{beings are}} seen as a {{microcosm}} of the universe, and for example comprise the Wu Xing in form of the zang-fu organs. As a consequence, it is believed that deeper understanding of the universe can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> by understanding oneself.|$|E

5|$|Still and Gennari have {{developed}} conditions that give Z-alkenes with excellent stereoselectivity. Using phosphonates with electron-withdrawing groups (trifluoroethyl) together with strongly dissociating conditions (KHMDS and 18-crown-6 in THF) nearly exclusive Z-alkene production can <b>be</b> <b>achieved.</b>|$|E
5|$|The fifth book {{returns to}} the subject of faith. Clement argues that truth, justice and {{goodness}} can be seen only by the mind, not the eye; faith is a way of accessing the unseeable. He stresses that knowledge of God can only <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> through faith once one's moral faults have been corrected. This parallels Clement's earlier insistence that martyrdom can only <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> by those who practice their faith in Christ through good deeds, not those who simply profess their faith. God transcends matter entirely, and thus the materialist cannot truly come to know God. Although Christ was God incarnate, it is our spiritual, not physical comprehension of him which is important.|$|E

50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to be the first player to achieve 100% success, this <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by {{reaching}} the top of four goals. The goals are wealth, happiness, education and career. Wealth <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by having a certain level of money in the bank, shares and cash in the hand, the player normally would earn this money by going to work. Happiness <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by achieving other goals, acquiring goods and taking time off work. Education <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by completing the available university qualifications, the number of qualifications the player must complete will be dependent on how high the goal level is set. Career <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by climbing the career ladder into a management position in a particular job.|$|R

5|$|A {{particular}} viewpoint {{is called}} a naya or a partial viewpoint. According to Vijay Jain, Nayavada does not deny the attributes, qualities, modes and other aspects; but qualifies them to be from a particular perspective. A naya reveals {{only a part of}} the totality, and should not be mistaken for the whole. A synthesis of different viewpoints is said to <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> by the doctrine of conditional predications (syādvāda).|$|E
3000|$|Without loss of generality, let α=ρ(cosθ+jsinθ), where ρ=|α| is {{the module}} of α and θ∈[0, 2 π [...]) is {{the phase of}} α.

5|$|According to {{the booklet}} Gandhi and Periyar Periyar {{wrote in his}} paper Kudi Arasu, in 1925, {{reporting}} {{on the fact that}} Gandhi was ousted from the Mahasabha, because he opposed resolutions for the maintaining of caste and Untouchability Laws which would spoil his efforts to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity.

5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating the steel to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material. Annealing goes through three phases: recovery, recrystallization, and grain growth. The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> and the alloying constituents.|$|E
5|$|Another model {{suggests}} humans {{attempt to}} achieve {{all of their}} needs and aspirations via seven modalities: economy, community, occupational groups, government, environment, culture, and physiology.

Human sustainability can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> by attaining sustainability in all levels of the seven modalities.|$|E

5|$|Another viable use {{of custom}} allocators is for {{debugging}} memory-related errors.

5|$|Computer {{architectures}} {{in which}} each element of main memory can be accessed with equal latency and bandwidth are known as uniform memory access (UMA) systems. Typically, that can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> only by a shared memory system, in which the memory is not physically distributed. A system {{that does not have}} this property is known as a non-uniform memory access (NUMA) architecture. Distributed memory systems have non-uniform memory access.|$|E
5|$|Crypsis means {{making the}} animal or {{military}} equipment {{hard to see}} (or to detect in other ways, such as by sound or scent).
