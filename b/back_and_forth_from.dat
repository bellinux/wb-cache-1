5|$|During {{the siege}} of Echinus by Philip V of Macedon in 211BC, the besiegers built {{underground}} tunnels to protect the soldiers and sappers as they went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> the camp to the siege works. These included two siege towers connected by a makeshift wickerwork curtain wall mounted with stone-shooting ballistae, and sheds to protect {{the approach of the}} battering ram. Despite the early reputation of Macedon as a leader in siege technology, Alexandria in Ptolemaic Egypt became the center for technological improvements to the catapult by the 3rdcenturyBC, as evidenced by the writings of Philo of Alexandria.|$|E

5000|$|The Old Norse form of {{the name}} was Øygir; this was {{originally}} {{the name of a}} fjord (now called the Eidsfjord). The name of the fjord is probably derived from a river name Aug, and this again is derived from the word öfugr which means [...] "backwards". The actual river (now called Eidselva) meanders <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>and</b> <b>from</b> certain points it can seem to run backwards.|$|R

According to security officials, {{the man was}} planning attacks for Hezbollah in Cyprus and admitted this after questioning. The police were alerted about the man due to an urgent message from Israeli intelligence. The Lebanese man was in possession of photographs of Israeli targets and had information on Israeli airlines flying <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> Cyprus, and planned {{to blow up a}} plane or tour bus. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that Iran assisted the Lebanese man with planning the attacks.|$|E

5|$|The first {{champions of}} French {{football}} were Standard Athletic Club, who defeated The White Rovers 2–0 in Courbevoie on 6 May 1894. The initial championship match {{was held on}} 29 April but finished 2–2, so the match was replayed. Standard {{went on to win}} the French championship four more times over the next seven years before RC Roubaix took control of the league becoming the first French club to win three straight titles beginning in 1902. Following Roubaix's success, the ownership of the amateur league title began rotating <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> the north of France to the south of France with Marseille eventually winning the last amateur title in 1929.|$|E

5000|$|Hydraulic dampers A short lived Luvax/Girling {{cooperation}} that moderated up {{and down}} leaf spring movement by turning that motion into a horizontal <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> motion <b>from</b> center. The damper hydraulically moderates, equally, both upward and downward motion of the wheels. In this sense they are quite different from shock absorbers, which mainly moderate upward movement of the wheel. Such dampers were used {{for a few years}} on light-weight British post-war cars, such as MG and Austin.|$|R
50|$|In those days, several steamboats began {{ferrying}} visitors <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> to Himmelbjerget, <b>from</b> various destinations across Julsø and The Silkeborg Lakes.

5|$|Alipate {{practice}}d {{with both}} the Los Angeles Raiders and the New York Jets in 1993, but he {{failed to make the}} active rosters for either team. In 1994, Alipate was again among the Jets' final cuts {{before the start of the}} regular season, but he was offered a spot on the team's practice squad. The Jets frequently moved Alipate <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> the practice squad and the active roster throughout the season. On November 14, Alipate recovered a botched punt in a 17–10 loss to the Green Bay Packers. Alipate also forced a fumble in a November 27 game against the Miami Dolphins. He finished the season with eight games played for the Jets. When active, Alipate was used mostly on special teams. He was signed to the Green Bay Packers' practice squad in January 1995. He re-signed with the Packers on February 21 and was waived on June 12, 1995.|$|E
5|$|Casting for {{the episode}} was difficult, as the {{production}} team wanted real Africans. They auditioned every one they could find, including an African theater troupe that was passing by. The role of Marcus Duff eventually went to Carl Lumbly, {{who was known}} for his role on CBS's Cagney & Lacey. The role of Aboah went to Willie Amakye, a Ghanaian Olympic runner who had just returned to his home in Southern California from the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, Georgia. To appear albino, Amakye's skin underwent several layers of cover-up cream, layers of white powder, and a little pink powder for color. He also wore contacts for the transparent pink eyes. Amakye's hair was dyed orange for post-production special effects to change it <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> black and white. As revealed on his resident alien card, Aboah's birthday is September 25, a reference to the birthday of Gillian Anderson's daughter.|$|E
5|$|Peet {{decided to}} follow closely the dramatic, dark, and {{sinister}} tone of Kipling's book, {{which is about the}} struggles between animals and man. However, the film's writers decided to make the story more straightforward, as the novel is very episodic, with Mowgli going <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> the jungle to the Man-Village, and Peet felt that Mowgli returning to the Man-Village should be the ending for the film. Following suggestions, Peet also created two original characters: The human girl for which Mowgli falls in love, as the animators considered that falling in love would be the best excuse for Mowgli to leave the jungle; and Louie, king of the monkeys. Louie was a less comical character, enslaving Mowgli trying to get the boy to teach him to make fire. The orangutan would also show a plot point borrowed from The Second Jungle Book, gold and jewels under his ruins— after Mowgli got to the man village, a poacher would drag the boy back to the ruins in search for the treasure. Disney was not pleased with how the story was turning out, as he felt it was too dark for family viewing and insisted on script changes. Peet refused, and after a long argument, Peet left the Disney studio in January 1964.|$|E
5000|$|Little Big Town {{announced}} on May 24, 2016 {{that they would}} be releasing a new album. For the album the group collaborated with songwriter-producer, Pharrell Williams. The album came about after the group had a writing session with Williams in January 2016 that [...] "turned into multiple writing sessions, as well as <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> trips <b>from</b> Nashville to Los Angeles." [...] They then wanted to share the music when they [...] "realized it was too special not to share" [...] with fans.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{this process}} of {{distribution}} seemed to work, although the legal technicality did not disguise the supremacy of the emperor or his often used right to transfer funds <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> regularly <b>from</b> the aerarium to the fiscus. The fiscus actually took shape after the reign of Augustus and Tiberius. It began as a private fund (fiscus meaning purse or basket) but grew to include all imperial monies, not only the private estates but also all public lands and finances under the imperial eye.|$|R

5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain patient that arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> the doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, {{with the help of his}} or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

25|$|Pre-production began around August 2008, with del Toro, Jackson, Walsh and Philippa Boyens {{writing the}} scripts. DelToro collaborated with Jackson, Walsh and Boyens via {{videoconferencing}} and flew every three weeks, <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> Los Angeles (where {{some of the}} designs were done) to New Zealand to visit them.

DelToro felt Tolkien's experiences in that war influenced his stories.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} six months of World War II, Bowlby worked at a clinic in Canonbury in the child {{psychiatry}} unit. Later on in the war, Bowlby became a lieutenant colonel in the Royal Army Medical Corps, where he conducted research on psychological methods of officer selection (which contributed to the creation of War Office Selection Boards) and where he came into contact with members of the Tavistock Clinic. Alongside his job in the Royal Army Medical Corps, Bowlby explained that he also worked for the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) during the months of May and June in 1940 where he dealt with tragic war neurosis cases. Additionally, the children that were being treated at the Canonbury clinic were evacuated to the child guidance clinic in Cambridge, due to the air raids from the War. Bowlby explained in an interview that he spent time going <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>forth</b> <b>from</b> Cambridge to London, where he would see patients in private. From this experience, Bowlby was able to work with several children at Cambridge that were evacuated from London and separated from their families and nannies. This actually extended his research interested on separation that he was focused on pre-war.|$|E
