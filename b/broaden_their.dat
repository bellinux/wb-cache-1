25|$|Mieszko I {{took over}} the tribal rule after his father's death ca. 950–960, {{probably}} closer to the latter date. Due {{to the lack of}} sources {{it is not possible to}} determine exactly which lands he inherited. Certainly among them were the areas inhabited by the Polans and Goplans, as well as the Sieradz-Łęczyca lands and Kuyavia. It is possible that this state included also Masovia and Gdańsk Pomerania. Soon the new ruler had faced the task of integrating the relatively large, ethnically and culturally heterogeneous territory. Although the residents of areas controlled by Mieszko spoke mostly one language, had similar beliefs and reached a similar level of economic and general development, they were socially connected primarily by tribal structures. It appears that the elders cooperating with the Duke first felt the need for super-tribal unity, as expansion allowed them to <b>broaden</b> <b>their</b> influence.|$|E

25|$|The PRC has {{consistently}} claimed sovereignty over Taiwan and asserted the ROC {{is no longer}} in legitimate existence. Under its One-China Policy the PRC refused diplomatic relations with any country that recognizes the ROC. Today 20 countries maintain official ties with the ROC but many other states maintain unofficial ties through representative offices and institutions that function as de facto embassies and consulates. Although Taiwan is fully self-governing, most international organizations in which the PRC participates either refuse to grant membership to Taiwan or allow it to participate only as a non-state actor. Internally, the major division in politics is between the aspirations of eventual Chinese unification or Taiwanese independence, though both sides have moderated their positions to <b>broaden</b> <b>their</b> appeal. The PRC has threatened {{the use of military force}} in response to any formal declaration of independence by Taiwan or if PRC leaders decide that peaceful unification is no longer possible.|$|E
25|$|After {{writing a}} column about Japanese popular culture {{for nearly a}} decade for the ezine PopMatters and penning over 600 entries in an online travelblog, Holden {{published}} the memoir, Peripatetic Postcards: The journey of life, through 25 of the world's cities, in 2010. Holden characterizes the work as a literary memoir of being and becoming; a set of lessons about life and musings on the human condition by a writer searching to find his way. The book opens by outlining a philosophy for undertaking the journey of life—what Holden calls “peripatacity”—and then enumerates a set of rules for conducting the journey. Subsequent chapters focus on the processes, people, places, predicaments, and philosophies encountered along life’s road. A final chapter personifies the journey by following the progress of the author, his wife and bi-cultural children on road trips through their native America and Japan—trips that prompt reflections on childhood, death, love, fate, God, happiness, family, home, place, personal growth, and the meaning of life. Throughout, Peripatetic Postcards operates at two levels: seeking to convey the panoply of human experience for those looking to <b>broaden</b> <b>their</b> understanding of the human condition in an increasingly globalized world, while also providing a model for discovery, personified in the author's experience.|$|E
