40|$|Understanding Nature {{itself is}} an {{essential}} component of developing an environmental ethic. However, many of the ‘positive ethics’ (i. e. ethics based on aesthetics, biophila, teleology) lack the critical observation that Nature does not act kindly or attempt to preserve an organism’s life and well being, but rather, statistically, operates by continually ending life. This paper develops from this notion that biological concepts such as symbiogenesis and <b>biotic</b> <b>potentials</b> point towards an environmental ethic founded upon aligning with Nature’s process of turning against itself. This paper claims that humans, being within Nature ontologically yet separated experientially, are alienated from the ideal Nature they must respond to. However, this ideal Nature experiences internal alienation as well; to the extent that many nonhuman animals also partake in the same objectification of life to produce self-protecting technology, one can claim Nature violates itself. And the only foundation for an environmental ethic is to mirror the process of Nature in understanding to what aim such self-destruction is aspiring. The answer: biological flux...|$|R
40|$|Purpose The {{inclusion}} of land-use activities in {{life cycle assessment}} (LCA) has been subject to much debate in the LCA community. Despite the recent methodological developments in this area, the impacts of land occupation and transformation on its long-term ability to produce biomass (referred to here as <b>biotic</b> production <b>potential</b> - BPP) - an important endpoint for the Area of Protection Natural Resources - have been largely excluded from LCAs {{partly due to the}} lack of life cycle impact assessment methods. Methods: An overview of existing methods/indicators associated with biomass, carbon balance, soil erosion, salinisation, energy, soil biota and soil organic matter (SOM) were evaluated. The latter indicator was considered the most appropriate, and characterisation factors for 8 land use types at the climate region level were developed. Results: Some indicators address land-use impacts satisfactorily for land uses that include biotic production of some kind (agriculture or silviculture). However, some fail to address potentially important land use impacts from other life cycle stages, such as those arising from transport. It is shown that the change in SOC can be used as an indicator for BPP, which combines and relates to a range of soil properties responsible for fertility into a stand-alone indicator. Conclusions: The results suggest that the proposed approach to characterize land use impacts on <b>Biotic</b> Production <b>Potential,</b> despite its limitations, is both possible and robust. The availability of land-use specific and biogeographically-differentiated data on SOC makes BPP impact assessments operable. The characterisation factors provided allow for the assessment of land-use impacts on BPP, regardless of where they occur. This is a new development in the LCIA of land use. Existing databases on every country's terrestrial carbon stocks and land use enable the operability of this method. Furthermore, BPP impacts will be better assessed by this approach as increasingly spatially-specific data are available for all geographical regions of the world at a large-scale. The resulting information would enable better life cycle assessments of products and services, as the important issue of the land use impacts on BPP can be captured. The characterisation factors developed are applied to the case studies (Part D of this special issue), which show the practical issues related to their implementation. JRC.

40|$|Environmental life‐cycle {{assessment}} (LCA) {{of products}} {{has been the}} focus of growing attention in the last few years. The methodological framework has been developed rapidly, and a provisional “Code of Practice” has been drawn up by an international group of experts. One of the elements of LCA is impact assessment, which includes a characterization step in which the contributions of resource extraction and polluting emissions to impact categories such as resource depletion, global warming, and acidification are quantified and aggregated as far as possible. This can be achieved by multiplying extractions and emissions by a so‐called equivalency factor and aggregating the results in one or more effect score(s) per impact category. In this report a proposal is developed for equivalency factors indicating the relative depletion of a resource per unit extracted. It is proposed to measure depletion by physical data on reserves and production and regeneration rates, and to distinguish between abiotic and biotic resources.

40|$|Comprehending {{ecological}} {{drivers of}} mosquito (Diptera: Culicidae) abundance involves a broad appreciation of their abiotic and biotic determinants. Such an appreciation is important where mosquito species cause significant nuisance to humans or are vectors of infectious disease. Here, a preliminary investigation is presented {{of relationships between}} larval abundance of the Ross River virus (RRV, Togoviridae: Alphavirus) vector Aedes camptorhynchus (Thomson), in saltmarshes of Tasmania, Australia, to environmental variables, aquatic fauna and surrounding land-use. Surveys of water bodies within six saltmarsh areas were undertaken during relatively stable (dry) environmental conditions, and one saltmarsh was opportunistically re-sampled following a heavy rainfall event. This study was intended to create a baseline of information from which to launch future, more detailed and targeted investigations. Significant relationships between land-use, environmental variables and aquatic fauna among water bodies were found. Abundance of Ae. camptorhynchus larvae was relatively low across sites during dry environmental conditions, but larvae were highly abundant in water bodies at one site following heavy rainfall. Abiotic and <b>biotic</b> correlates (<b>potential</b> determinants) with larval Ae. camptorhynchus abundance differed during these two sampling periods. During dry environmental conditions larvae were negatively related to pH, turbidity, dissolved magnesium, presence of decapods and abundance of amphipods, and positively related to samphire cover. Following rainfall, larval abundance was negatively related to abundance of ostracods. Indirect relationships between land-use and abundance of Ae. camptorhynchus may exist, but more detailed investigations are required to explore this implication. © 2011 The Authors.

Results show that two physical parameters determine the expression of biotic potential: the confinement induces an important decrease of the fecundity and longevity of E. formosa; the position of plant leaf with nymphs of Trialeurodes vaporari-orum (Westwood) (Homoptera Aleyrodidae) that the parasitoid female can explore for oviposition and host-feeding influences on the <b>biotic</b> <b>potential.</b> The heterogeneity observed in the replicates suggests that during their mass-processing the parasitoids suffer abiotic conditions leading to changes in the <b>biotic</b> <b>potential</b> of progeny.

40|$|The plant's innate {{immune system}} detects <b>potential</b> <b>biotic</b> threats through {{recognition}} of microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), or danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), by pattern recognition receptors (PRRs). A central regulator of pattern-triggered immunity (PTI) is the BRI 1 associated kinase 1 (BAK 1) which undergoes complex formation with PRRs upon ligand binding. Although viral patterns inducing PTI are well known from animal systems, nothing similar has been reported for plants. Antiviral defense in plants is rather thought to be mediated by posttranscriptional gene silencing of viral RNA, or through effector-triggered immunity, i. e. recognition of virus-specific "effectors" by resistance proteins. Nevertheless, infection by compatible viruses {{can also lead to}} the induction of defense gene expression, indicating that plants may also recognize viruses through PTI. Here we show that PTI, or at least the presence of the regulator BAK 1, is important for antiviral defense of Arabidopsis plants. Arabidopsis bak 1 mutants show increased susceptibility to three different RNA viruses during compatible interactions. Furthermore, crude viral extracts, but not purified virions, induce several PTI marker responses in a BAK 1 -dependent manner.

Although for particular zoonoses some host species have been identified, until recently there have been no methods to predict those species most likely to be hosts or their relative importance. Complex inference networks infer <b>potential</b> <b>biotic</b> interactions between species using their degree of geographic co-occurrence, and have been posited as a potential tool for predicting disease hosts.

Using systematic sampling to validate the model predictions we identified 22 new species of host (34 % of all species collected) with the probability to be a host strongly dependent on the probability of co-occurrence of vector and host. The results confirm that Leishmania (L.) mexicana is a generalist parasite but with a much wider host range than was previously thought.

Using plants and biological soil crusts, we tested {{the relative importance of}} facilitative–competitive interactions and other community attributes (cover, species richness and species evenness) as drivers of ecosystem functioning along stress gradients in semi-arid Mediterranean ecosystems. Biotic interactions shifted from facilitation to competition along stress gradients driven by water availability and temperature.

We found little evidence to suggest that biotic interactions are a major direct influence upon indicators of ecosystem functioning (soil respiration, organic carbon, water-holding capacity, compaction and the activity of enzymes related to the carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus cycles) along stress gradients. However, attributes such as cover and species richness showed a direct effect on ecosystem functioning.

We modified a spatially explicit model of Alaskan subarctic treeline dynamics (ALFRESCO) to simulate boreal vegetation dynamics in interior Alaska. The model is used to investigate the role of black spruce ecosystems in the fire regime of interior Alaska boreal forest. Model simulations revealed that vegetation shifts caused substantial changes to the fire regime. The number of fires and the total area burned increased as black spruce forest became an increasingly dominant component of the landscape. The most significant impact of adding black spruce to the model {{was an increase in}} the frequency and magnitude of largescale burning events (i. e., time steps in which total area burned far exceeded the normal distribution of area burned). Early successional deciduous forest vegetation burned more frequently when black spruce was added to the model, considerably decreasing the fire return interval of deciduous vegetation.

The data were obtained by the Oklahoma State Department of Health during 1976 - 1986. Significant differences in dissolved oxygen, temperature, turbidity, conductivity, and flow rate were observed among sites, reflecting longitudinal changes in physiography, land use, and tributary influence. Fish assemblage parameters and physicochemical variables were more frequently correlated at upstream sites than at downstream sites. At upstream sites, fish species richness, density, and biomass were positively correlated with typical low-flow conditions. These parameters increased when water velocity, average depth, flow rate, and turbidity decreased. Multiple regression analyses indicated a trend to higher r values at upstream sites for all three parameters when the variation in these parameters was explained by variation in physicochemical factors.

The contribution of CO 2 production from three soil layers to plot-scale soil respiration was quantified. CO 2 production and efflux residuals after subtracting the effects of the main abiotic and biotic drivers were analysed. Results Soil CO 2 production showed a strong negative correlation with ET rates with a time lag of 0. 5 hours in the two upper layers, whereas less strong, but still significant time-lagged and positive correlations were found between GPP and soil CO 2 production. Our results suggest a rapid negative response of soil CO 2 production rates to transpiration changes, and a delayed positive response to GPP.

Here, we explore the local assemblage structure of a herbaceous plant community at its early stage of succession in a supratidal wetland. Specifically, we assess the role of Chinese saltcedar (Tamarix chinensis), the lone dominant shrub species, in shaping the spatial structure and species composition in the local plant community, after landscape alteration. Methods We used the multivariate trend-surface analysis for analyzing the spatial structure of the community composition. A null model was also used to detect <b>potential</b> <b>biotic</b> interactions between species. Statistical significance was derived from a permutation test by randomizing the presence-absence matrix and functional traits independently.

Important Findings The herbaceous plant community was highly structured and shaped by the presence of T. chinensis. At local scale, two functional traits, plant height and leaf area, were found to be significantly convergent. Dispersal, environmental stress and interspecific competition played a trivial effect on the local community assembly.

In general, limestone has greater water holding capacity than basalt and its soils are more basic, have higher phosphate levels and have a greater pH buffering capacity than soils on basalt. This study also looks at the biological impact of these substrate abiotic differences by using multivariate discriminate analysis to compare bryophyte communities on each substrate. Five species are tightly correlated with a particular substrate. Ectropothecium sandwichense and Floribundaria aerunginosa prefer limestone whereas  Calymperes aongstroemii, Taxithelium vernieri, and Ectropothecium sodale, prefer basalt. Because the distribution of these species is highly correlated with substrate in nature, a reciprocal transplant experiment was designed to see if substrate directly affected a specie's growth. Ectropothecium sodale and Ectropothecium sandwichense can, physiologically, grow on either substrate. This suggests that other factors like elevation, predation and community effects might be contributing to the segregated bryophyte communities observed in nature. Understanding the abiotic and <b>potential</b> <b>biotic</b> factors that influence the distributions of bryophytes enables locals, scientists and developers to use these plants as bioindicators of habitat change...|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of tree seedlings in primary succession {{is thought to}} occur only after an adequate reserve of nutrients has accumulated in the soil. Individuals of Pinaceae are sometimes reported to grow on very recently deglaciated substrates. This study analyzed the colonization of a glacier foreland by Pinus wallichiana. Physical, chemical, and <b>biotic</b> aspects of <b>potential</b> and observed seedling microsites were analyzed with regression methods and tests for proportions. Microsites with intermediate to high moisture levels and alkaline nutrient-poor soils {{were found to be}} conducive to seedling establishment. The most recently deglaciated parts of the foreland have soils with little nutrients and high pH. There is a linear change in soil variables from low nutrient content and high pH at the most recently deglaciated parts to more nutrient-rich and neutral toward the pre-neoglacial moraines. Surrounding old-growth forests of Pinus wallichiana shed an abundance of seeds onto the foreland, are able to germinate and grow, and are predominant among the early pioneers, which makes this species an unusual pioneer of primary succession. Colonization by P. wallichiana is not restricted to particular safe sites. Even though individuals look chlorotic and stunted, they grow at near normal rates. Leaf discoloration of seedlings occurs in soils with high pH and low nitrogen content. P. wallichiana is also a canopy dominant on some of the oldest terrains and outside the foreland...|$|R
