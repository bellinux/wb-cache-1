40|$|Purpose Fish {{oils and}} related fatty acid {{components}} have anti-inflammatory properties, with beneficial effects against various {{disorders such as}} cardiovascular disease. A single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise can alter immune function. However, the effects of fish oil on immune function after a single <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> exercise are currently unknown. This study investigated the effect of supplementation with fish oil on the immune response to an acute <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> endurance exercise. Methods Sixteen male subjects underwent a six week double blind randomised placebo controlled supplementation trial involving two groups (fish oil or placebo oil, 3  g/day). They attended for two visits, the first involving a maximal exercise test and the second involving a 1 -h <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> endurance exercise on a cycle ergometer at 70...|$|R

In parts of India, male elephants regularly enter villages at night, destroying homes and killing people. Elephants killed around 300 people between 2000 and 2004 in Jharkhand while in Assam, 239 people were reportedly killed between 2001 and 2006.|$|E

40|$|A short <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> high fat diet (HFD) impairs glucose {{tolerance}} and induces hepatic steatosis in mice. Here, we aimed {{to elaborate on}} long-lasting effects of short-term high fat feeding. As expected, one week of HFD significantly impaired glucose tolerance. Intriguingly, recovery feeding with a standard rodent diet for 8 weeks did not fully normalize glucose tolerance. In addition, mice exposed to a short <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> HFD revealed significantly increased liver fat accumulation paralleled by elevated portal free fatty acid levels after 8 weeks of recovery feeding compared to exclusively chow-fed littermates. In conclusion, a short <b>bout</b> <b>of</b> HFD has long-lasting effects on hepatic lipid accumulation and glucose tolerance...|$|R
