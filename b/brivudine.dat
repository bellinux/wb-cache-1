40|$|Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is {{a highly}} {{infectious}} human herpesvirus that is the causative agent for chicken pox and shingles. VZV encodes a functional thymidylate synthase (TS), which is the sole enzyme that produces dTMP from dUMP de novo. To study substrate binding, the complex structure of TSVZV with dUMP was determined to a resolution of 2. 9 Å. In {{the absence of a}} folate co-substrate, dUMP binds in the conserved TS active site and is coordinated similarly as in the human encoded TS (TSHS) in an open conformation. The interactions between TSVZV with dUMP and a cofactor analog, raltitrexed, were also studied using differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), suggesting that TSVZV binds dUMP and raltitrexed in a sequential binding mode like other TS. The DSF also revealed interactions between TSVZV and in vitro phosphorylated <b>brivudine</b> (BVDUP), a highly potent anti-herpesvirus drug against VZV infections. The binding of BVDUP to TSVZV was further confirmed by the complex structure of TSVZV and BVDUP solved at a resolution of 2. 9 Å. BVDUP binds similarly as dUMP in the TSHS but it induces a closed conformation of the active site. The structure supports that the 5 -bromovinyl substituent on BVDUP is likely to inhibit TSVZV by preventing the transfer of a methylene group from its cofactor and the subsequent formation of dTMP. The interactions between TSVZV and BVDUP are consistent with that TSVZV is indeed a target of <b>brivudine</b> in vivo.

40|$|Drug {{repositioning}} identifies new indications for known drugs. Here {{we report}} repositioning of the malaria drug amodiaquine {{as a potential}} anti-cancer agent. While most repositioning efforts emerge through serendipity, we have devised a computational approach, which exploits interaction patterns shared between compounds. As a test case, we took the anti-viral drug <b>brivudine</b> (BVDU), which also has anti-cancer activity, and defined ten interaction patterns using our tool PLIP. These patterns characterise BVDU’s interaction with its target s. Using PLIP we performed an in silico screen of all structural data currently available and identified the FDA approved malaria drug amodiaquine as a promising repositioning candidate. We validated our prediction by showing that amodiaquine suppresses chemoresistance in a multiple myeloma cancer cell line by inhibiting the chaperone function of the cancer target Hsp 27. This work proves that PLIP interaction patterns are viable tools for computational repositioning and can provide search query information from a given drug and its target to identify structurally unrelated candidates, including drugs approved by the FDA, with a known safety and pharmacology profile.

40|$|We {{developed}} a rapid and simple method for the screening of antiviral agents against {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV) in a model of gastrointestinal herpetic infection in vitro. This method was based on inhibition of HSV-induced cytopathogenicity in gastric adenocarcinoma MKN- 28 cells, as monitored by an MTT colorimetric assay. From the various compounds that were evaluated for their activity against HSV- 1 and HSV- 2, <b>brivudine</b> (BVDU) emerged as the most effective. When the 50 % effective concentration (EC 50) values of the antiherpes agents in MKN- 28 cells were compared with those in human embryo lung MRC- 5 cells, all compounds, except for BVDU, showed higher EC 50 values in MKN- 28 cells. For BVDU the EC 50 values in MKN- 28 cells were 0. 8 (HSV- 1) and 0. 036 (HSV- 2) times the EC 50 values in MRC- 5 cells. Thus BVDU was 27. 5 times more active against HSV- 2 in MKN- 28 cells than in MRC- 5 cells. The MKN- 28 gastric cancer cells may be useful for the rapid screening of anti-HSV agents and, in particular, those that {{may be useful in}} therapy of gastrointestinal HSV infections in gastrointestinal herpetic infection. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) is {{responsible}} for primary infections as well as reactivations after latency in the dorsal root ganglia. The treatment of such infections is mandatory for immunocompromised patients and highly recommended for elderly patients with herpes zoster infections (also called zona or shingles).

We present here our data on the antiviral activity of {{a new class of}} potent and selective anti-VZV compounds, bicylic pyrimidine nucleoside analogues (BCNAs), against a broad variety of clinical isolates and different drug-resistant virus strains. The results show that the BCNAs are far more potent inhibitors than ACV and BVDU against clinical VZV isolates as well as the VZV reference strains Oka and YS. The BCNAs were not active against ACV- and BVDU-resistant VZV strains bearing mutations in the viral thymidine kinase gene but kept their inhibitory potential against virus strains with mutations in the VZV DNA polymerase gene.

40|$|Polyomavirus {{infections in}} humans {{are due to}} BK virus (BKV) and JC virus (JCV). Diseases {{associated}} with human polyomaviruses occur mostly in immunocompromised adults, e. g., progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), caused by JCV, in AIDS patients and hemorrhagic cystitis and uretral stenosis, caused by BKV, in transplant recipients. No therapy is available for these diseases, which necessitates the development of chemical entities that are active against polyomaviruses. Several antiviral compounds were evaluated to determine their effects on the in vitro replication of mouse polyomavirus and the primate viruses simian virus 40 (SV 40), SV 40 PML- 1, and SV 40 PML- 2. The activity of the different compounds was assessed by a cytopathic effect reduction assay and confirmed in a virus yield assay. Cidofovir [HPMPC; (S) - 1 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) cytosine] and its cyclic counterpart emerged as the most selective antipolyomavirus agents. The 50 % inhibitory concentrations for HPMPC were {{in the range of}} 4 to 7 micrograms/ml, and its selectivity index varied from 11 to 20 for mouse polyomavirus and from 23 to 33 for SV 40 strains in confluent cell monolayers. Cell cytotoxicity was up to 15 -fold greater in growing cells. Other acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (i. e., HPMPA; [(S) - 9 -(3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl) adenine] and PMEG [9 -(2 -phosphonylmethoxyethyl) -guanine]) also showed some activity but had low selectivity. None of the other drugs tested against these animal viruses (i. e., acyclovir, ganciclovir, <b>brivudine,</b> ribavirin, foscarnet, and cytarabine) showed significant activity.

40|$|In this study, {{approaches}} {{were developed}} to examine the phenotypes of nonviable clinical varicella-zoster virus (VZV) strains with amino acid substitutions in the thymidine kinase (TK) (open reading frame 36 [ORF 36]) and/or DNA polymerase (Pol) (ORF 28) suspected to cause resistance to antivirals. Initially, recombinant TK proteins containing amino acid substitutions de-scribed as known or suspected causes of antiviral resistance were analyzed by measuring the TK activity by applying a modified commercial enzyme immunoassay. To {{examine the effects of}} these TK and Pol substitutions on the replication of recombinant virus strains, the method of en passantmutagenesis was used. Targeted mutations within ORF 36 and/or ORF 28 and an autono-mously expressed gene of the monomeric red fluorescent protein for plaque identification were introduced into the European wild-type VZV strain HJO. Plaque reduction assays revealed that the amino acid substitutions with unknown functions in TK, Q 303 stop, N 334 stop, A 163 stop, and the deletion of amino acids 7 to 74 aa (aa 7 to 74), were associated with resistance against acyclovir (ACV), penciclovir, or <b>brivudine,</b> whereas the L 73 I substitution and the Pol substitutions T 237 K and A 955 T revealed sensitive viral phenotypes. The results were confirmed by quantitative PCR bymeasuring the viral load under increasing ACV concentrations. In conclusion, analyzing the enzymatic activities of recombinant TK proteins represent a useful tool for evaluat-ing the significance of amino acid substitutions in the antiviral resistance of clinical VZV strains. However, direct testing of rep-lication-competent viruses by the introduction of nonsynonymous mutations in a VZV bacterial artificial chromosome using en passantmutagenesis led to reliable phenotypic characterization results...|$|E

Whereas human and bacterial thymidine phosphorylases (TPases) efficiently converted BVDU to its antivirally inactive free base (E) - 5 -(2 -bromovinyl) uracil (BVU), BCNAs showed no evidence of conversion to the free base in the presence of these enzymes. The lack of substrate affinity of TPase for the BCNAs could be rationalized by computer-assisted molecular modeling of the BCNAs in the TPase active site.

Consequently, whereas BVU caused a dramatic rise of FU levels in FU-treated mice, the BCNAs did not affect FU levels in such mice.

The following compounds were included: acyclovir (ACV), <b>brivudine</b> (BVDU), sorivudine (BVaraU), other BVDU congeners such as BTDU, CTDU, CVDC and CVDU, ganciclovir (GCV), FIAC, araT, araA, araC, foscarnet (PFA), phosphonoacetic acid (PAA), the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates HPMPC, cHPMPC, HPMPA, cHPMPA, HPMPc 3 A, PMEA and PMEDAP, the N 7 -isomeric acyclic nucleoside analogue N 7 AP, penciclovir (PCV), compounds 882 C 87 and H 2 G and two oxetanocin derivatives OXT-A and OXT-G. Fourteen of the 16 clinical isolates displayed the following order of decreasing selectivity against VZV: BVaraU > BVDU > CVDU ∼ CVDC > H 2 G > N 7 AP } CTDU ∼ BTDU ∼ OXT-G ∼ 882 C 87 > ACV > FIAC ∼ araT > HPMPC ∼ cHPMPC ∼ HPMPA ∼ HPMPc 3 A ∼ cHPMPA > PCV ∼ GCV ∼ OXT-A > PMEDAP ∼ PMEA > PFA ∼ PAA ∼ araA > araC. Two VZV strains (isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of an AIDS patient) that were shown to have a truncated TK were clearly resistant to all the compounds that need the viral TK for their phosphorylation, while sensitivity to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates, PFA, PAA, OXT-A and araA, remained unchanged. A slight (5 - and 10 -fold) increase was noted in the 50 % inhibitory concentration of N 7 AP and OXT-G, respectively, for the TK- VZV strains as compared to the TK+ VZV strains. Ganciclovir and FIAC also showed a marked decrease in their activity against these two strains, but this was not as pronounced as for the other viral TK-dependent drugs.

40|$|Varicella zoster virus (VZV), {{a member}} of the {{herpesvirus}} family, is responsible for both primary (varicella, chickenpox) as well as reactivation (zoster, shingles) infections. In immunocompetent patients, the course of varicella is generally benign. For varicella zoster, post-herpetic neuralgia is the most common complication. In immunocompromised patients (particularly those with AIDS), transplant recipients and cancer patients, VZV infections can be life-threatening. For these patients and also for immunocompetent patients at risk such as pregnant women or premature infants, the current treatment of choice is based on either intravenous or oral aciclovir (acyclovir). The low oral bioavailability of aciclovir, as well as the emergence of drug-resistant virus strains, have stimulated efforts towards the development of new compounds for the treatment of individuals with VZV infections. Among these new compounds, penciclovir, its oral prodrug form famciclovir and the oral pro-drug form of aciclovir (valaciclovir), rank among the most promising. As with aciclovir itself, all of these drugs are dependent on the virus-encoded thymidine kinase (TK) for their intracellular activation (phosphorylation), and, upon conversion to their triphosphate form, they act as inhibitors/alternative substrate of the viral DNA polymerase. Therefore, cross-resistance to these drugs may be expected for those virus mutants that are TK-deficient and thus resistant to aciclovir. Other classes of nucleoside analogues dependent for their phosphorylation on the viral TK that have been pursued for the treatment of VZV infections include sorivudine, <b>brivudine,</b> fialuridine, fiacitabine and netivudine. Among oxetanocins, which are partially dependent on viral TK, lobucavir is now under clinical evaluation. Foscarnet, which does not require any previous metabolism to interact with the viral DNA polymerase, is used in the clinic when TK-deficient VZV mutants emerge during aciclovir treatment. TK-deficient mutants are also sensitive to the acyclic nucleoside phosphonates (i. e. [s]- 1 -[3 -hydroxy- 2 -phosphonylmethoxypropyl]cytosine; HPMPC); these agents do not depend on the virus-encoded TK for their phosphorylation but depend on cellular enzymes for conversion to their diphosphoryl derivatives which then inhibit viral DNA synthesis. Vaccination for VZV has now come of age. It is recommended for healthy children, patients with leukaemia, and patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy or those with chronic diseases. The protection induced by the vaccine seems, to some extent, to include zoster and associated neuralgia. Passive immuniatin based on specific immunoglobulins does not effectively prevent VZV infection and is therefore restricted to high risk individuals (i. e. immunocompromised children and pregnant women). status: publishe...|$|E
