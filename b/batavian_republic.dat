Although war between Britain and the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> had not been declared, the British government sent instructions on 19 January for Batavian shipping to be seized and, in conjunction with Stadtholder William of Orange, living in exile in London, for Batavian colonies to be neutralised in order to deny their use to the French. On 9 February these orders culminated in the outbreak of war between Britain and the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Action of 22 August 1795 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of four British Royal Navy frigates and two frigates and a cutter from the Navy of the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic.</b> The engagement was fought off the Norwegian coastal island of Eigerøya, then in Danish Norway, the opposing forces engaged in protecting their respective countries' trade routes to the Baltic Sea. War between Britain and the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> began, undeclared, {{in the spring of}} 1795 after the Admiralty ordered British warships to intercept Batavian shipping following the conquest of the Dutch Republic by the French Republic in January 1795.|$|E

5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794–1795 the armies of the French Republic overran the Dutch Republic, {{reforming}} the country into a client state named the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic.</b> The Dutch Republic {{was part of the}} Coalition against Republican France formed in the War of the First Coalition {{at the start of the}} French Revolutionary Wars, and their closest ally in Northern Europe was Great Britain. In Britain the Admiralty was alarmed by developments in the Netherlands, particularly the seizure of the Dutch Navy by French cavalry units while the fleet was frozen into its winter harbour, and gave orders that the Royal Navy was to detain Dutch merchant and naval ships. As a result, the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> and Great Britain began an undeclared war in the spring of 1795.|$|E
5|$|An {{abortive}} {{effort to}} support the French invasion fleet was also made by the Navy of the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic,</b> which despatched the small frigates Furie and Waakzaamheid to Ireland with military supplies on 24 October. Within hours of leaving port, both these ships were intercepted and captured by the British frigate HMS Sirius under the young Captain Richard King at the Action of 24 October 1798.|$|E
5|$|However most, if not all, {{characteristics}} of the current centralized state of the Kingdom of the Netherlands were foreshadowed by {{the accomplishments of the}} <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic,</b> not least the liberal 1848 Constitution.

5|$|In February 1793, the French Republic {{declared}} war on the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic, drawing both into the ongoing French Revolutionary Wars. Less than two years later, {{in the winter of}} 17941795, the Dutch Republic was overrun by the French Army, French cavalry charging the Dutch Navy across the ice that blocked its winter anchorages, capturing it intact. The French reorganised the country into a client state named the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic,</b> and ordered the Dutch Navy to operate in the North Sea against British maritime trade routes. The British government did not immediately declare war on the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic,</b> but did take steps to seize Dutch shipping in British ports and established a new fleet to combat Batavian operations in the North Sea. The North Sea Fleet, as it was known, was composed mainly of older and smaller vessels not considered suitable for service in the Channel Fleet, and command of this force was given to the 66year old Admiral Adam Duncan.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} the {{captured}} goods from Colombo alone amounted to more than £300,000. More importantly for the British, Ceylon {{was not one of}} the colonies returned to the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> following the Treaty of Amiens which brought the war to a brief close in 1802. Britain retained Ceylon as part of the British Empire until independence was granted in 1948.|$|E
5|$|There were {{no further}} {{attacks on the}} Cape Colony during the war. The Treaty of Amiens in 1802 {{returned}} all captured Dutch colonies except Ceylon to the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic,</b> including the Cape Colony. The peace was short-lived, and early in the Napoleonic Wars a second British expeditionary force was prepared. In 1806 the British seized the Cape Colony a second time following the Battle of Blaauwberg. Cape Colony remained part of the British Empire until its independence {{as part of a}} unified South Africa in 1910.|$|E

The Navy registered and commissioned her in 1805 in the Leeward Islands. Gooding was confirmed in his rank on 20 November.|$|R
25|$|Early in 1802, Hippomenes, {{under the}} command of Captain-Lieutenant Melvill, was {{assigned}} to the West Indies and Guinea coast division of the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic's</b> navy. After the end of the French Revolutionary Wars, the British returned the Dutch colonies they had captured in the West Indies to the Republic. In August 1802, Captain Cornelius Hubertus Buchman, of Kenau Hasselar, took a small squadron that also included the frigate Proserpina, Hippomenes, the cutter Rose, and the schooner Serpent, to take possession of Curaçao. Kenau Hasellar and Rose arrived at Willemstad on 22 December. The other vessels in the squadron sailed to other destinations.|$|R
50|$|After the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic's</b> {{transformation}} into the Kingdom of Holland under Louis Bonaparte in 1806, general Dumonceau became a conseiller d'État and marshal of Holland. He regularly commanded Dutch {{troops in the}} Napoleonic Wars and on 30 March 1809 was made a naturalised Dutch citizen by king Louis. He was later made count of Bergenduin on 15 April 1810. After Holland's annexation by France in July 1810, Dumonceau was made a comte de l'Empire by Napoleon I of France on 28 January 1811, then count of Bergendal, {{with the establishment of}} majorat in département d'Ombrone on 2 May 1811.|$|R
5|$|In 1799 the 49th was {{assigned}} to the Helder Expedition against the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> (now known as the Netherlands), to be led by Sir Ralph Abercromby. During the troop landings, Brock saw his first combat on 10 September 1799 under the command of then-Major-General John Moore. Given that the 49th was in poor shape when Brock took command, they saw little actual combat. Likely Moore was sparing them and using more experienced troops to establish the beachhead. Finally on 2 October the 49th was actively involved in heavy combat at the Battle of Alkmaar, where they acquitted themselves well, sustaining only 33 deaths.|$|E
5|$|In {{the winter}} of 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran the Dutch Republic. The French National Convention {{reformed}} the Dutch Republic into a revolutionary client state named the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic.</b> This event alarmed the government of Great Britain, erstwhile allies of the Dutch, as the Dutch Empire controlled a number of strategically important colonies in the East Indies. The key to controlling European access to the region was the Dutch Cape Colony on the tip of Southern Africa; a naval force based there could dominate the trade routes between Europe and the East Indies, in particular the economically vital links between Britain and British India.|$|E
5|$|Returning {{from his}} long convalescence, Hope was again {{requested}} by Duncan and commanded his flagship HMS Kent {{for the next}} three years. In 1799, the Kent was Duncan's flagship in supporting the Anglo-Russian invasion of the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic,</b> with Hope being present at the surrender of the Dutch fleet in Texel to the Royal Navy. Sent to Britain with the dispatches proclaiming the surrender, Hope was lauded by both the British and Russian courts, King George III presenting him with £500 and Tsar Paul I making him a Commander of the Order of St John.|$|E

5000|$|Van Kooten was - {{together}} with Wybo Fijnje and Samuel Iperusz Wiselius - {{a member of}} the committee for the deconstruction of the VOC (Dutch East India Company). On the recommendation of Johannes Henricus Nieuwold, in 1798 Van Kooten became the first minister of education ("Agent for National Education"). A year later he was replaced by Johannes van der Palm. He traveled to Madrid as secretary to Johan Valckenaer, who had become the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic's</b> extraordinary ambassador to Spain. In 1801 they returned, but van Kooten remained Valckenaer's housemate in Bennebroek, while his wife and children lived in Kampen. [...] "Dorus Droefheid" [...] died aged 63.|$|R
5000|$|Convinced of {{the ideals}} of the French Revolution, he turned against slavery and {{published}} a dissertation on the question: 'In what respect can men be said to be equal? And what are the rights and duties that follow from this equality?' ('In welken zin kunnen de menschen gezegd worden gelijk te zijn? En welke zijn de regten en pligten die daaruit voortvloeien?'). In 1793 he was named [...] "apostle of mankind" [...] (apostel der mensheid). In 1795, {{he was one of the}} ringleaders of the revolution. The next year he was unanimously appointed chairman of the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic's</b> National Assembly. At the inauguration, he caught a serious cold from which he died, in 's-Gravenhage, aged 41.|$|R
5|$|The {{warships}} of the Batavian squadron {{were all}} commissioned into the Royal Navy {{and attached to}} the squadron at the Cape, an action for which Elphinstone was criticised by the Admiralty. Elphinstone returned to Britain in October 1796. His flagship Monarch passed right through the French fleet of the Expédition d'Irlande during a snow storm, anchoring in a disabled state at Crookhaven on 25 December. Following his return he was made Baron Keith for his capture and retention of the Cape Colony. Most of the sailors and soldiers in the Dutch force were Germans and nearly all entered British service, either with the Royal Navy or the East India Company. Lucas and the Dutch officers later returned to Europe in the cartel Gertruida. One of the captured ships, HMS Dortrecht became notorious the following year when the crew mutinied at Saint Helena in imitation of the Spithead and Nore mutinies in Britain. Only the intervention of Captain Charles Brisbane, who threw a noose around the ringleader's neck and threatened death if the disobedience was repeated, succeeded in intimidating the rebellious seamen. In the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> Lucas's surrender caused popular outrage. On the admiral's return he faced a court martial by the National Assembly of the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> on 11 April 1797 and an investigation by Jacobus Spoors. Lucas did not survive to see {{the conclusion of the}} trial, dying of natural causes on 21 June 1797, but he was ultimately exonerated in December 1797.|$|E
5|$|At the {{declaration}} of war on Britain by the newly formed French Republic on 1 February 1793, British forces in the Indian Ocean held a considerably stronger military position, which was immediately utilised to seize the French territories in India. The remaining French forces continued operating from their base on the remote island of Île de France, privateers in particular conducting a highly disruptive campaign against British commerce. Attempts by the Royal Navy, commanded by Rear-Admiral Peter Rainier, to limit their effectiveness resulted {{in a number of}} inconsequential clashes and a partial blockade of the French islands. In 1795 {{the declaration}} of war on Britain by the newly formed <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> led to successful invasions of the Batavian colonies of Dutch Ceylon, the Dutch Cape Colony and operations against the Dutch East Indies.|$|E
5|$|On 15 August 1796 Elphinstone's larger fleet {{discovered}} Lucas's {{force and}} trapped {{it in the}} bay. Aware that resistance would be futile and with his crews in open revolt, Lucas surrendered unconditionally. The ships of the captured Batavian force were taken into the Royal Navy, joining the squadron at the Cape; Elphinstone was later made Baron Keith in recognition of his achievements. The Batavian operation did however force the cancellation of a planned British invasion of Île de France. Lucas faced a court martial on {{his return to the}} Netherlands, but died before it concluded by exonerating him for the defeat. The Cape Colony was not attacked again {{before the end of the}} war in 1802, when the Treaty of Amiens returned it to the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic.</b>|$|E
50|$|After the {{execution}} of Robespierre in 1794, Sieyès reemerged as an important political player during the constitutional debates that followed. In 1795, he went on a diplomatic mission to The Hague, and was instrumental in drawing up a treaty between the French and <b>Batavian</b> <b>republics.</b> He resented the Constitution of the Year III enacted by the Directory, and refused {{to serve as a}} Director of the Republic. In May 1798, he went as the plenipotentiary of France to the court of Berlin, {{in order to try to}} induce Prussia to ally with France against the Second Coalition; this effort ultimately failed. His prestige grew nonetheless, and he was made Director of France in place of Jean-François Rewbell in May 1799.|$|R
50|$|Fighting in the {{invasion}} of the Dutch Republic under general Pichegru in 1795, he moved to the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic's</b> army as a lieutenant-general. In 1796 he commanding the troops protecting the provinces of Groningen, Friesland and Drenthe, before being made military governor of the Hague. During the Anglo-Russian Invasion of Holland he brought up two-thirds of his 2nd Batavian division in forced marches from Friesland and he arrived on 8 September to take on a position {{in the center of the}} Franco-Batavian front, around Alkmaar, in time for the Battle of Krabbendam. He was then reinforced with the 7th Half-brigade of Daendels' division. He was wounded at the battle of Bergen (1799) and was thus unable to participate in the Battle of Alkmaar. In 1805 he commanded the corps of Batavian troops placed under the command of maréchal Mortier.|$|R
50|$|He was {{appointed}} by Napoleon member {{of the council of}} state and senator. Roederer and Talleyrand contributed to Charles-François Lebrun's rise past Sieyès, and the former's appointment as Consul. In 1800, Roederer was Minister Plenipotentiary to the <b>Batavian</b> and Helvetic <b>Republics.</b> He received the Legion of Honor in 1803, and was made a Grand Officier in December 1807.|$|R
5|$|Protection of British {{interests}} in the region fell primarily to the Royal Navy, supported by the military forces of the East India Company. Naval strategy sought to eliminate enemy forces in the region and provide convoy protection to the large East Indiamen merchant ships and smaller company ships which transported goods and wealth between Britain and its Asian colonies and trade partners. The French Navy maintained commerce raiding operations in the region throughout the war; particularly light frigate squadrons and privateers deployed in an effort to disrupt British trade, supported as the conflict developed by the allies the French accrued {{in the course of the}} war, particularly the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic</b> and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The Action of 12 May 1796 {{was a minor}} naval {{engagement}} {{during the}} French Revolutionary Wars between a squadron of British Royal Navy frigates and a frigate and four smaller ships of the Navy of the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic.</b> The British squadron had been detached on the previous day from the British North Sea fleet under Admiral Adam Duncan, which was cruising off the Batavian fleet anchorage at the Texel, while the Batavian squadron was returning to the Netherlands from the Norwegian coast {{where it had been}} sheltering since suffering defeat at the Action of 22 August 1795 the previous year. As the Batavian squadron neared the Batavian coast, the British squadron under Captain Lawrence Halstead attacked.|$|E
5|$|The Capitulation of Saldanha Bay saw the {{surrender}} to the British Royal Navy of a Dutch expeditionary force sent to recapture the Dutch Cape Colony in 1796 during the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran the Dutch Republic which then became a French client state, the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic.</b> Concerned by the threat posed to the trade routes between Great Britain and British India by the Dutch Cape Colony in Southern Africa, a British expeditionary force had landed at Simon's Town in June 1795 and forced {{the surrender}} of the colony in a short campaign. The British commander, Vice-Admiral Sir George Elphinstone, then reinforced the garrison and stationed a naval squadron at the Cape to protect the British conquest.|$|E
50|$|The Moniteur, {{which became}} the {{official}} State Journal in 1800, was placed under his control. He sometimes succeeded in toning down the hard, abrupt language of Napoleon's communications, and in every way proved a useful intermediary. It is known {{that he had a}} share in the drawing up of the new constitutions for the <b>Batavian</b> and Italian <b>Republics.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Invasion of the Cape Colony was a British {{military}} expedition {{launched in}} 1795 against the Dutch Cape Colony at the Cape of Good Hope, {{the southern tip}} of Southern Africa. The Dutch colony at the Cape, established in the seventeenth century, was at the time the only viable South African port for ships making the journey from Europe to the European colonies in the East Indies. It therefore held vital strategic importance, although it was otherwise economically insignificant. In the winter of 1794, during the French Revolutionary Wars, French troops entered the Dutch Republic, which was reformed into the <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic.</b> In response, Great Britain launched operations against the Dutch Empire to use its facilities against the French Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, Tone and {{his companions}} tried again, this time persuading {{the government of the}} <b>Batavian</b> <b>Republic,</b> which was under French occupation, to prepare their own expedition. During 1797, the Dutch fleet was readied and provisioned, intending to combine with the French fleet and launch a second invasion attempt. The Batavian fleet sailed on a preparatory raiding cruise in the North Sea in October 1797 and on their return were confronted off the Dutch coast by the Royal Navy's North Sea Fleet under Admiral Sir Adam Duncan. Duncan immediately attacked, and in the ensuing Battle of Camperdown captured or destroyed ten ships and scattered the rest, ending the Batavian invasion threat.|$|E
