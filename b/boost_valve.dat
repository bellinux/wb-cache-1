40|$|Downsizing and {{turbocharging}} is {{a widely}} used approach to reduce the fuel consumption of spark ignited engines while retaining the maximum power output. However, a substantial loss in drivability must be expected due to the occurrence of the so-called turbo lag. The turbo lag results from the additional inertia that the turbocharger adds to the system. Supplying air by an additional valve, the <b>boost</b> <b>valve,</b> to the intake manifold {{can be used to}} overcome the turbo lag. This turbo lag compensationmethod is referred to as intakemanifold boosting. The aims of this study are to show the effectiveness of intake manifold boosting on a turbocharged spark-ignited engine and to show that intake manifold boosting can be used as an enabler of strong downsizing. Guidelines for the dimensioning of the <b>boost</b> <b>valve</b> are given and a control strategy is presented. The trade-off between additional fuel consumption and the consumption of pressurized air during the turbo lag compensation is discussed. For a load step at 2000 rpm the rise time can be reduced from 2. 8 s to 124 ms, requiring 11. 8 g of pressurized air. The transient performance is verified experimentally by means of load steps at various engine speeds to various engine loads...|$|E

50|$|When Buick {{pulled out}} of IndyCar racing in 1993, John Menard {{continued}} developing the engine, now badged as the Menard V-6. Brayton, now without a regular ride in the CART IndyCar series, joined the Indy-only Menards team in 1994. Their belief in the powerplant paid off when Brayton won his first Indy 500 pole position in 1995, at an average speed of 231.604 mi/h km/h. Turbocharger <b>boost</b> and pop-off <b>valve</b> problems relegated him to a 17th-place finish.|$|R

50|$|The Megatron {{programme}} ended as {{a result}} of a change of Formula One engine rules which banned turbocharged engines at the end of 1988, with American driver Eddie Cheever achieving the old BMW engine's last podium finish with third place in the 1988 Italian Grand Prix at Monza. The race was also significant as it was the first time Heini Mader had solved the problem caused by the FIA's <b>boost</b> limit <b>valve</b> which limited turbo boost pressure to 4.0 Bar in 1987 and 2.5 Bar in 1988. By moving the valve closer to the engine, the problem of the turbo not delivering enough boost had been solved and the Arrows A10B's were among the fastest on the long Monza straights, faster even than the all-conquering McLaren-Hondas into which designer Steve Nichols had effectively incorporated elements of Gordon Murray's lowline Brabham design as well as featuring a more powerful V6 engine.|$|R

The brake system utilizes hydraulic pressure for power <b>boost.</b> The brake <b>valves</b> are controlled via the rudder pedal toe brakes through mechanical linkages. Two shuttle valves in the pressure lines prevent fluid feedback between the pilot's and copilot's pedals. Four additional shuttle valves connect the pneumatic system to the brake system for emergency braking. An integral anti-skid system in installed to affect maximum braking efficiency. In order to minimize heat build-up in the brakes and reduce brake wear, pilots are advised to deploy the spoilers upon touchdown.|$|R
40|$|Astrophysical {{observations}} in the ultraviolet band have many advantages. At present, the «Spektr-UF» project is under implementation {{to create a}} large space observatory for operation in the ultraviolet spectrum. Requirements for the ultraviolet telescope optics quality are extremely high. Therefore, both to manufacture such a large space telescope as the T- 170 M and to transport it to the launch complex are rather difficult challenges in terms of technology. When manufacturing optical elements of the telescope T- 170 M, a combination of Al+MgF 2 coatings has been preferred. At the same time, atmospheric oxygen penetrates through the pores in the magnesium fluoride, thereby forming a Al 2 O 3 oxide layer on the sputtered aluminum, which significantly degrades the UV reflectivity of the mirror surface. It is also necessary {{to fulfill the requirements}} for surface cleanliness of optical system elements of the telescope during the finished product transportation and its storage and to provide for the autonomous operation of the system that maintains atmosphere control. To solve the set tasks: 1)     a dust-proof-and-moisture-proof sheath (DPAMPS) was designed to prevent the optical system mirror surfaces of the telescope from coming in contact with atmosphere; 2)     to provide a controlled atmosphere inside the DPAMPS the need is justified to blow gaseous nitrogen of special purity (grade 1) in accordance with GOST 9293 - 74 with a dew point temperature of - 50 °С, at most, inside the telescope; calculations have proved that charging with the super-atmospheric pressure of 10 kPa provides the optimal conditions for maintaining the optical properties of the space telescope mirrors surface, and also minimizes the loads on the easily damaging elements of the telescope; 3)     to ensure the required cleanliness of the optical system elements surfaces of the telescope inside the DPAMPS, a class of purity Class 7 ISO, at worst, is established in accordance with GOST ISO 14644 - 1 - 2002; contamination tolerance of optical system components being, at most, 0. 03 % of the total surface area (300 p. p. m.) is provided by the rational choice of the blow-down scheme of the telescope with feeding nitrogen through the equipment bay; 4)     a rational design of the supercharger using a gas analyzer and <b>boost</b> <b>valves</b> with external feedback provides driving pressure and operation autonomy of the system that maintains atmosphere control. </p...|$|R

Switch-mode hydraulic circuits, analogous to switch-mode power electronics, provide {{variable power control}} topologies that rely on switching between efficient on and off states. A challenge in realizing these circuits {{is the need for}} a high-speed valve with fast transition time and high switching frequency. The work presented includes the design and modeling of a suitable valve and experimental demonstration of the prototype in a pressure <b>boost</b> converter. The <b>valve</b> architecture consists of a dual spool design actuated by a crank-slider mechanism. The valve design constraints included a switching frequency up to 120 Hz, a transition ratio of 5 % of the cycle period, and a flow rate of 22. 8 lpm at a 0. 6 MPa pressure drop. The valve prototype was validated with experimental demonstration in a pressure boost converter accomplishing boost ratios between 1. 08 - 2. 06. This high-speed valve enables switch-mode circuit studies that can improve efficiency in future work...|$|R
40|$|Increasing {{environmental}} constraints {{have led to}} a corresponding increase in engine complexity. As a result there is more of a requirement to fully understand and manage the task of hardware selection and engine optimization. Traditionally undertaking these tasks in either experimental or simulation environments would be highly time and cost inefficient and iterative. A technique is developed whereby data is merged {{from a variety of sources}} thus reducing the aforementioned problems whilst still retaining high system knowledge. Technologies relating to engine downsizing are focused on since it has been identified as one of the more promising methods in meeting future CO 2 constraints. Engine downsizing is a smaller highly boosted engine performing the same role of a larger engine with reduced heat and frictional losses. In order to address these issues this research develops a range of techniques that enable technologies such as high <b>boost,</b> variable <b>valve</b> actuation (WA), variable compression ratio (VCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to be evaluated as part of the overall powertrain optimization process. A novel experimental data merging process proved to be the most successful method and showed improved accuracy over simulation studies, particularly with reference to NOx and BSFC. As part of the experimental work in capturing high boost data a novel charge air handling unit is employed. This emulates the effects of boosting hardware as opposed to having to develop prototype hardware itself. The advantage is it can operate outside the production envelope and is thus capable of emulating a variety of current and future boosting strategies. Within this research the charge air handling unit reaches 2 bar boost irrespective of engine speed, although there is capacity to go up to 3 bar with a reduced compression ratio engine and uprated gaskets. Further development of the technique at full load will give the automotive engineer an invaluable tool to make informed powertrain selection choices early in the development cycle, thus reducing cost and potential problems at later stages.

40|$|High Pressure Lean Burn (HPLB) engines {{have the}} {{potential}} to achieve high load with high efficiency and low emissions compared to currently available powertrains. Various HPLB concepts have been experimentally studied in the literature, focusing on the combustion event but often neglecting the techniques required to provide appropriate cylinder boundary conditions. This dissertation investigates the interactions between the combustion event, in this case Homogeneous Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI), and engine processes occurring externally to the cylinder that are critical for HPLB operation. For that reason, multi-cylinder boosted HCCI engines were simulated and analyzed based on energy and exergy flow considerations. The multi-cylinder engine model included several submodels the most critical of which were the HCCI combustion and heat transfer modules. Both of these were evaluated based on different experimental datasets and their capability to simulate wide range operation was assessed. The calibrated models were subsequently used to explore the synergies between <b>boosting,</b> Variable <b>Valve</b> Actuation (VVA), Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) and different compression ratio levels for high load HCCI. It was found that utilizing hot intake air is highly beneficial for boosted operation. Hot air can reduce dependence on residual gas for mixture composition and temperature control; it also allows manipulation of the valve strategy so that boosting performance is optimized. In fact, it enables use of regular high lift valve events for improving engine efficiency and suppressing pressure rise rates. It was found that the combination of advanced boosting systems with VVA strategies offers significant efficiency benefits and renders HCCI technology more accessible for future powertrain applications. Energy and exergy analysis showed that advanced boosting and VVA enhanced dilution levels, suppressed cylinder temperatures and lowered pumping work. The outcome was high levels of thermal and gas exchange efficiencies. These benefits were enough to outweigh drawbacks from increased cylinder irreversibilities and reduced exhaust flow exergy, both resulting from low temperature combustion. Low heat rejection was also explored and was found to be very beneficial for HCCI. Overall, the engine simulation and analysis framework provides a useful tool for exploration and assessment of HPLB engines employing current or future technology...|$|R
