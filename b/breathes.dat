40|$|Background The {{commonly}} held idea that &# 039;proper&# 039; <b>breathing</b> {{is important for}} health is generally accompanied by the view that incorrect or &# 039;dysfunctional&# 039; <b>breathing</b> has adverse effects on health. It has been proposed that correction of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> through <b>breathing</b> therapy reduces symptoms and improves the health of patients with conditions such as asthma, anxiety, speech disorders, chronic muscular skeletal dysfunction and medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, investigation {{of the impact of}} dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> and <b>breathing</b> therapies is hampered by the fact that dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> is not well defined and that there are few validated measures or standard ized protocols to measure it. Aims The four main objectives of the experimental portion of thesis are: • To further develop and validate some clinical tools for assessment of dysfunctional breathing; • To explore and evaluate current methods for assessing dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> particularly those used by <b>breathing</b> therapists; • To investigate the relationships between measures of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> with a view to understanding the possible definitions and dimensions of dysfunctional breathing; and • To explore possible mechanisms of <b>breathing</b> therapy. Method A series of seven studies were untaken. Various non-experimental and quasi-experimental study designs were used These papers, which are all published (or in press) manuscripts, form the experimenta l portion of this thesis. The seven studies presented in the empirical section of this thesis are grouped in four sub-sections - The first of these contains two studies on the topic of &# 039;Measuring <b>Breathing</b> Pattern&# 039;, the second contains one study on the topic &# 039;Evaluating Dysfunctional <b>Breathing</b> Symptoms&# 039;, the third include two studies that investigate &# 039;Relationships between Measures of <b>Breathing</b> Functionality&# 039; and the final sub-section contains two studies that explores &# 039;Measures of Dysfunctional <b>Breathing</b> and <b>Breathing</b> Therapy&# 039;. Results/Discussion Manual techniques for evaluating <b>breathing</b> pattern appear to be useful and reasonably accurate for evaluating thoracic dominant <b>breathing</b> and paradoxical <b>breathing.</b> The Self Evaluation of <b>Breathing</b> Quest ionnaire appears to have two dimensions that might be related to biochemical and biomechanical aspects of <b>breathing</b> dysfunction. Poor relationships between different categories of measures of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> suggest that dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> has several dimensions. <b>Breathing</b> pattern appears to moderate dyspnea and altering <b>breathing</b> pattern may be one mechanism of <b>breathing</b> therapy. Conclusion While dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> cannot be strictly defined at present, for practical purposes dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> is probably best characterized as multidimensional. Dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> can occur in at least three dimensions: biochemical, <b>breathing</b> pattern and <b>breathing</b> related symptoms and these might not co-exist.   Comprehensive measurement of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> should include measures that evaluate all these dimensions. The therapeutic mechanisms of <b>breathing</b> theory are likely to be comple x and include psychological, biomechanical and physiological parameters. However, dysfunctional patterns of <b>breathing</b> are one factor that influences patients&# 039; response to <b>breathing</b> therapy. Also correction of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> patterns is one likely therapeutic pathway of <b>breathing</b> therapy, particularly for patients with dyspnea...|$|R

5|$|The {{skin of a}} frog is {{permeable}} to {{oxygen and}} carbon dioxide, {{as well as to}} water. There are blood vessels near the surface of the skin and when a frog is underwater, oxygen diffuses directly into the blood. When not submerged, a frog <b>breathes</b> by a process known as buccal pumping. Its lungs {{are similar to those of}} humans, but the chest muscles are not involved in respiration, and no ribs or diaphragm exist to help move air in and out. Instead, it puffs out its throat and draws air in through the nostrils, which in many species can then be closed by valves. When the floor of the mouth is compressed, air is forced into the lungs. The fully aquatic Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.|$|E

5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who <b>breathes</b> at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E

50|$|A pneumograph or {{respiratory}} {{strain gauge}} uses a flexible sensor band that is placed around the chest, abdomen, or both. The strain gauge method can provide feedback {{about the relative}} expansion/contraction of the chest and abdomen, and can measure respiration rate (the number of breaths per minute). Clinicians can use a pneumograph to detect and correct dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> patterns and behaviors. Dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> patterns include clavicular <b>breathing</b> (<b>breathing</b> that primarily relies on the external intercostals and the accessory muscles of respiration to inflate the lungs), reverse <b>breathing</b> (<b>breathing</b> where the abdomen expands during exhalation and contracts during inhalation), and thoracic <b>breathing</b> (shallow <b>breathing</b> that primarily relies on the external intercostals to inflate the lungs). Dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> behaviors include apnea (suspension of <b>breathing),</b> gasping, sighing, and wheezing.|$|R
40|$|Background & objectives: Practice of <b>breathing</b> {{exercises}} like pranayama {{is known}} to improve autonomic function by changing sympathetic or parasympathetic activity. Therefore, {{in the present study}} the effect of <b>breathing</b> exercises on autonomic functions was performed in young volunteers in the age group of 17 - 19 yr. Methods: A total of 60 male undergraduate medical students were randomly divided into two groups: slow <b>breathing</b> group (that practiced slow <b>breathing</b> exercise) and the fast <b>breathing</b> group (that practiced fast <b>breathing</b> exercise). The <b>breathing</b> exercises were practiced for a period of three months. Autonomic function tests were performed before and after the practice of <b>breathing</b> exercises. Results: The increased parasympathetic activity and decreased sympathetic activity were observed in slow <b>breathing</b> group, whereas no significant change in autonomic functions was observed in the fast <b>breathing</b> group. Interpretation & conclusion: The findings of the present study show that regular practice of slow <b>breathing</b> exercise for three months improves autonomic functions, while practice of fast <b>breathing</b> exercise for the same duration does not affect the autonomic functions.

40|$|Variations in {{respiratory}} pattern {{influence the}} heart rate spectrum. It has been suggested, hence, that metronomic respiration {{should be used to}} correctly assess vagal modulation of heart rate by using spectral analysis. On the other hand, <b>breathing</b> to a metronome has been reported to increase heart rate spectral power in the high- or respiratory frequency region; this finding has led to the suggestion that metronomic respiration enhances vagal tone or alters vagal modulation of heart rate. To investigate whether metronomic <b>breathing</b> complicates the interpretation of heart rate spectra by altering vagal modulation, we recorded the electrocardiogram and respiration from eight volunteers during three <b>breathing</b> trials of 10 min each: 1) spontaneous <b>breathing</b> (mean rate of 14. 4 breaths/min); 2) <b>breathing</b> to a metronome at the rate of 15, 18, and 21 breaths/min for 2, 6, and 2 min, respectively; and 3) <b>breathing</b> to a metronome at the rate of 18 breaths/min for 10 min. Data were also collected from eight volunteers who <b>breathed</b> spontaneously for 20 min and <b>breathed</b> metronomically at each subject's mean spontaneous <b>breathing</b> frequency for 20 min. Results from the three 10 -min <b>breathing</b> trials showed that heart rate power in the respiratory frequency region was smaller during metronomic <b>breathing</b> than during spontaneous <b>breathing.</b> This decrease could be explained fully by the higher <b>breathing</b> frequencies used during trials 2 and 3 of metronomic <b>breathing.</b> When the subjects <b>breathed</b> metronomically at each subject's mean <b>breathing</b> frequency, {{the heart rate}} powers during metronomic <b>breathing</b> were similar to those during spontaneous <b>breathing.</b> Our results suggest that vagal modulation of heart rate is not altered and vagal tone is not enhanced during metronomic <b>breathing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Various <b>breathing</b> {{training}} programmes {{may be helpful}} for adults with asthma.
