40|$|In {{the event}} of a major network outage such as a ber cable cut, a network can {{experience}} signi cant deterioration of network performance. To address such a situation, a network can be equipped with restoration capacity. We present here a mathematical model and design algorithm for determination of transmission network restoration capacity. We then present models for two restoration options { connection based restoration and load directed restoration (for restoration of <b>bundle</b> <b>of</b> <b>circuits)</b> { and consider their impact on a wide-area dynamic call routing teletrac network when the restoration capacity is limited (tight). Our network simulation of failure and restoration of a dynamic call routing teletrac network shows that the load directed approach generally performs better than the connection based approach.
