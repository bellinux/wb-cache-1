5|$|Since Alfred Eisenack first {{recognised}} {{and named}} {{the group in}} 1930, the Chitinozoa have proven incredibly useful as a stratigraphic markers in biostratigraphy during the Ordovician, Silurian and Devonian periods. Their utility {{is due to the}} rapidity of their morphological evolution, their abundance — the most productive samples bearing almost a thousand tests per gram — and the easy identification (due largely to the large variation in shapes) and short lifetimes (<10 million years) of most species. They are also widely distributed and appear in a variety of marine depositional settings, making correlation easier; <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> they can often be recognised in even quite strongly metamorphosed rocks. However, convergence of morphological form to similar environments sometimes leads to the mistaken identification of a species in several areas separated by vast differences in space and time, but sharing a similar depositional environment; clearly, this can cause major problems if the organisms are interpreted as being the same species. Aside from the acritarchs, chitinozoans were the only reliable means of correlating palæozoic units until the late 1960s, when the detailed study of conodonts and graptolites fully unleashed their stratigraphic potential.|$|E

25|$|The Kuvasz's stiff, dense coat, {{growing up}} to 15cm (6 inches) in length, {{does not require}} any special grooming. It needs to be brushed once a week or, <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> {{every two or three}} days. For {{standard}} grooming purposes, use of a grooming rake or a pin-brush with rounded pins is recommended. To remove stubborn knots, use a curry comb or a large-toothed comb. During the spring and autumn the Kuvasz moults (also known as shedding), and he will lose copious amounts of hair very quickly. Frequent brushing is therefore needed to keep his coat tidy. A Kuvasz should not smell or have an odor; such is usually a sign of illness or a poor diet.|$|E

25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} Daly's {{steady-state}} economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind, especially {{not in the}} longer run. Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the crust of the Earth, exploration and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns, whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores. In the course of time, then, extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase. Eventually, all minerals will be exhausted, but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity: There will still be deposits of resources left in the crust, but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade; hence, continued extraction will no longer pay off, and the market for these resources will then collapse. This long-term dynamics works itself through any economic (sub-)system, regardless of the system's geographical location, its size and its state of development (whether a progressive, a steady or a declining state). In effect, the arguments advanced by Daly {{in support of his}} steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy, Georgescu points out: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is <b>better</b> <b>still!</b> In this context, Georgescu also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels man-made capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steady-state.|$|E
25|$|Shortly afterwards, John Paul Jones got the {{opportunity}} {{he had been}} striving for—not a moment too soon, as his ship had been holed below the waterline and was becoming increasingly unresponsive. Serapis’ jib-boom caught in the rigging of Bonhomme Richard’s mizzen mast, and Jones immediately led his crew in attaching the two ships together as strongly as they could. Seeing the danger, Pearson dropped anchor. Because both ships were under sail, when Serapis {{came to an abrupt}} halt, Bonhomme Richard would keep going, and with luck, tear free. Jones’ men had been very efficient, so what actually happened was that Bonhomme Richard’s motion was turned into a rotation, and the two ships, still firmly attached, ended up side-by-side, facing in opposite directions, their great guns touching each other’s hull planks. <b>Better</b> <b>still</b> for Jones, Serapis’ spare anchor caught in the woodwork of Bonhomme Richard’s stern, locking the two ships in that extraordinary position. Making a virtue of necessity, Pearson’s crew fired broadsides straight into Bonhomme Richard’s hull, tearing huge holes in its side, and doing terrible damage to the gun-decks. For Jones’s boarding plan to succeed, he needed to drive all the Royal Navy sailors from Serapis’ deck before his ship was destroyed beneath him. He had prepared well for such an eventuality, and his men at stations up the masts were equipped both with small guns and with incendiary grenades. Three 9-pound guns on the quarter-deck (the rear part of the upper deck) were still usable, although one was on the wrong side, and had to be dragged around. Two of these guns were loaded with anti-personnel grapeshot to help drive Pearson’s men from the deck, but the third was used with solid bar-shot (see Naval Artillery page) aimed at Serapis’ main-mast.|$|E

The conference motion was reversed the following year, but he continued to pursue the matter in parliament. On 29 May 1962 he urged that Britain not be a party to the renewal of nuclear tests, and in a speech on 23 July he said: [...] "The unilateral abandonment of testing—or, <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> a test ban agreement—would be the most valuable first step towards general and complete disarmament." ...|$|E
500|$|When the {{campaign}} began, the Kokoda Track started at McDonald's Corner, just beyond Ilolo. From there, the track slowly rose about [...] to what later {{became known as}} Owers' Corner. The road from Port Moresby was sealed as far as Seven Mile, and from there a gravel surface was laid to provide an all-weather road as far as Sogeri, roughly [...] from Port Moresby. On 24 June, GHQ queried {{whether it would be}} possible to upgrade the track to one that could handle animal transport or, <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> motor vehicles. There were multiple tracks leading to Kokoda, and in addition to the main track, there was interest at New Guinea Force HQ in a route along the Brown River that had been partially surveyed in 1912.|$|E

The single received generally unfavourable reviews from video game music critics. Gann of RPGFan called it [...] "vanilla" [...] {{and said that the}} single, especially the headline track, was over-produced and uninteresting. While he did not mind [...] "Eternal Love" [...] as much, he still felt that the CD was his least favorite Final Fantasy theme single. Square Enix Music Online had similar opinions of the release, calling it [...] "bland".

500|$|In 1939, {{at the age}} of 45 {{and with}} {{eyesight}} that continued to deteriorate, he happened to hear of the Bates method and sought the help of Margaret Corbett, who gave him regular lessons. Three years later he wrote The Art of Seeing, in which he related: [...] "Within a couple of months I was reading without spectacles and, what was <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> without strain and fatigue.... At the present time, my vision, though very far from normal, is about twice as good {{as it used to be}} when I wore spectacles." [...] Describing the process, Huxley wrote that [...] "Vision is not won by making an effort to get it: it comes to those who have learned to put their minds and eyes into a state of alert passivity, of dynamic relaxation." [...] He expressed indifference regarding the veracity of Bates' explanation of how the eye focuses, stating that [...] "my concern is not with the anatomical mechanism of accommodation, but with the art of seeing." ...|$|E

[...] Their four-star review declares that [...] "it {{is a work of}} genius, a ready made rock classic and arguably the last word in rock operas." [...] In The Tip Sheet, Jonathan King labelled it a [...] "glorious, splendid album," [...] celebrating Meat Loaf's [...] "operatically gorgeous" [...] voice and Steinman's [...] "superb" [...] songs, arrangements and production. [...] "You'll be blown away. <b>Better</b> <b>still</b> you'll catch yourself openly laughing out loud at times with delight.

Tuition was [...] "comparatively low, <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> {{it did not}} discriminate against Jews,... {{while most of the}} surrounding medical schools—Cornell, Columbia, University of Pennsylvania, and Yale—had rigid quotas in place." [...] Yale, for example, accepted 76 applicants, in 1935, out of a pool of 501. Although 200 of the applicants were Jewish, only five got in. During his years at New York University Medical School, Salk worked as a laboratory technician during the school year and as a camp counselor in the summer.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{firewood}} is {{harvested in}} [...] "woodlots" [...] managed for that purpose, but in heavily wooded areas {{it is more}} often harvested as a byproduct of natural forests. Deadfall that has not started to rot is preferred, since it is already partly seasoned. Standing dead timber is considered <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> as it is both seasoned, and has less rot. Harvesting this form of timber reduces the speed and intensity of bushfires. Harvesting timber for firewood is normally carried out by hand with chainsaws. Thus, longer pieces - requiring less manual labor, and less chainsaw fuel - are [...] less expensive and only limited {{by the size of}} their firebox. Prices also vary considerably with the distance from wood lots, and quality of the wood.|$|E
2500|$|Each one-hour {{programme}} {{follows the}} team of grifters as they practise the [...] "long con", an extended deception practised against one or more [...] "marks" [...] (targets).

In the first series, Stacie explains to Danny the reason such long cons tend to work: unlike the more obvious short cons, [...] "most marks don't report a con because they think they've done something illegal, or <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> they don't know they've been conned in the first place".|$|E

Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: [...] "It slowly dawned on me that they were asking for a larger-than-life scene, or <b>better</b> <b>still,</b> a mad scene.
