5|$|DuMont {{survived the}} early 1950s {{only because of}} WDTV in Pittsburgh, the lone {{commercial}} VHF station {{in what was then}} the sixth-largest market. WDTV's only competition came from UHF stations and distant stations from Johnstown, Pennsylvania; Youngstown, Ohio; and Wheeling, West Virginia. No other commercial VHF station signed on in Pittsburgh until 1957, giving WDTV a de facto monopoly on television in the area. Since WDTV carried secondary affiliations with the other three networks, DuMont used this as a <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip</b> to get its programs cleared in other large markets.|$|E
5|$|Arab historians {{argue that}} Israel {{had entered the}} Battle of Karameh with too much confidence, since it took place just after Israel had {{defeated}} the Arabs in the 1967 Six-Day War. The size of the Israeli forces entering Karameh made the Jordanians assume that Israel was also planning to occupy the eastern bank of the Jordan River, including the Balqa Governorate, {{in order to create}} a Golan Heights similar situation so as to be used a <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip.</b> Jordanians claim that Moshe Dayan invited Israeli journalists on the previous day for lunch in western Jordan after occupying it.|$|E

5|$|U.S.-Soviet {{relations}} took a {{turn for}} the worse with the Soviet’s arrest of U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff, evidently for use as a <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip</b> in response to the August 30, 1986 arrest of suspected KGB agent Gennadiy Zakharov. Since Daniloff was not engaged in espionage, Matlock advised taking a hard line with the Soviets. While charges against Daniloff were dropped, a diplomatic row ensued, leading by the end of October, to the expulsion of 100 Soviets, including 80 suspected intelligence officers. The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow, along with all 260 of the Russian support staff.|$|E
5|$|In 1230 the Teutonic Knights, a crusading {{military}} order, {{moved to}} Chełmno Land and launched the Prussian Crusade against the pagan Prussian clans. With {{support from the}} pope and Holy Roman Emperor, the Teutons conquered and converted the Prussians by the 1280s and shifted {{their attention to the}} pagan Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For about 100 years the Knights raided Lithuanian lands, particularly Samogitia, as it separated the Knights in Prussia from their branch in Livonia. While the border regions became an uninhabited wilderness, the Knights gained very little territory. The Lithuanians first gave up Samogitia during the Lithuanian Civil War (1381–1384) in the Treaty of Dubysa. The territory was used as a <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip</b> to ensure Teutonic support for one of the sides in the internal power struggle.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1912 naval law was passed, Britain and Germany {{attempted}} {{to reach a}} compromise with the Haldane Mission, led by the British War Minister Richard Haldane. The arms reduction mission ended in failure, however, and the 1912 law was announced shortly thereafter. The Germans were aware at as early as 1911, the Royal Navy had abandoned {{the idea of a}} decisive battle with the German fleet, in favor of a distant blockade at the entrances to the North Sea, which the British could easily control due to their geographical position. There emerged the distinct possibility that the German fleet would be unable to force a battle on its own terms, which would render it militarily useless. When the war came in 1914, the British did in fact adopt this strategy. Coupled with the restrictive orders of the Kaiser, who preferred to keep the fleet intact {{to be used as a}} <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip</b> in the peace settlements, the ability of the High Seas Fleet to affect the military situation was markedly reduced.|$|E

After being deinfested, {{she was taken}} in Valerian Mengsk's hideout to research on her, until the Dominion attacks the facility, she escaped {{along with the rest}} of the facility, except Raynor, who was captured by Nova. She later learned that Raynor was executed and seeks revenge on Arcturus. As she enters a Leviathan, she controls the local Swarm inside, and starts rebuilding her forces from scratch. She later evolved into a Primal Zerg after a confrontation with Zeratul, leading her to the origins of the Zerg. She became a Primal, after absorbing the spawning pool and killing Primal Leaders to collect essence. With her newfound power, she initially takes the fight to the Dominion after subduing countless Queens. She was later shocked after she knows that Raynor survived and held by Dominion as a <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip.</b> She organizes a raid, rescuing Raynor but the man fell into disbelief that the one he saved, returns to being a monster. She also confronted an ancient Shapeshifter creating Hybrids at the behest of her former rival named Alexei Stukov. She later prepared to end Arcturus Mengsk's reign by killing him in his palace in Korhal. She later left to confront the Shapeshifter's master.|$|E
5|$|Gwyndolyn's story {{focuses on}} the time after her sister Griselda is killed in battle — having always come second in her father's eyes, Gwyndolyn tries hard to impress him, but must {{ultimately}} defy him when his general Brigan attempts to undermine him. Gwyndolyn is placed in an enchanted sleep for her defiance, to be woken and {{fall in love with}} the first man who kisses her. After being spirited to the lands of Onyx by the Three Wise Men, Gwyndolyn's story becomes intertwined with Oswald's. Oswald is involved in an attempted coup against Mercedes by Melvin and is taken by Odette as payment for the power Melvin infused into Oswald's psypher. He is then used by Odin to take Titrel from Wagner by force, but ultimately rebels and rescues Gwyndolyn from Onyx after learning that Odin did not enchant her, giving Titrel to the awoken Gwyndolyn as a gift. Gwyndolyn, initially defiant, begins to fall in love, but is tricked into giving Titrel to Odin. Feeling betrayed, Oswald allows Odette to take him. Mercedes' story runs parallel to the others, chronicling her efforts to become queen in the wake of her mother's death and Melvin's attempted coup. With the help of the dwarf smith Brom, she refashions her psypher into a weapon powerful enough to destroy Odin's psypher, winning a battle against him and taking Titrel. Titrel is subsequently stolen by Gwyndolyn, who uses it as a <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip</b> to rescue Oswald from Odette, who is killed by Gwyndolyn. Initially torn between love for Oswald and duty to Odin, Gwyndolyn defies her father and leaves with Oswald and Titrel, which now acts as a symbol of their love. Odin is then accosted by Ingway and Velvet; Ingway transforms into a monster in an unsuccessful attempt to kill Odin, then Velvet and Ingway are rescued by Cornelius.|$|E

50|$|Hitler's geopolitical {{thoughts}} about Africa always occupied a secondary position to his expansionist aims in Europe itself. His public announcements prior to {{outbreak of the}} war that Germany's former colonies be returned to it served primarily as <b>bargaining</b> <b>chips</b> to further territorial goals in Europe itself. Africa was nevertheless expected to fall under German control {{in some way or}} another after Germany had first achieved supremacy over its own continent.|$|R
50|$|The FARC guerrillas {{originally}} {{demanded that}} in order to proceed with the humanitarian exchange, the government must demilitarize a zone, which are the municipalities of Pradera and Florida in the southern Department of Valle del Cauca. The government of Colombia maintained that this is impossible and non-negotiable. However, after Ingrid Betancourt and three American contractors were rescued in July 2008, the FARC dropped that demand because they no longer had their most famous <b>bargaining</b> <b>chips.</b>|$|R
25|$|In colonial America, {{replevin}} {{was used}} {{more often than}} detinue.

25|$|The late 1970s {{and early}} 1980s were a {{turbulent}} {{time for the}} Taiwan-born {{as many of the}} people who had originally been oppressed and left behind by economic changes became members of the Taiwan's new middle class. Free enterprise had allowed native Taiwanese to gain a powerful <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip</b> in their demands for respect for their basic human rights. The Kaohsiung Incident would be a major turning point for democracy in Taiwan.|$|E
25|$|The {{taking and}} holding of Falmouth or Milford was a {{strategy}} the Spanish {{would use to}} hold a piece of England {{in retaliation for the}} seizure of Cadiz. In turn this would be used as <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip</b> in which English troops would withdraw from the continent both in France and the United provinces. If not then the captured places would also be used as a forward base for the harassment of English and Dutch trade.|$|E
50|$|Among the 435 people {{released}} by Israel were Mustafa Dirani and Sheik Abdel Karim Obeid. These two individuals were kidnapped, in 1994 and 1989 respectively, {{for use as}} <b>bargaining</b> <b>chips</b> {{in the effort to}} secure the release of the most famous of the Israeli MIAs, Ron Arad. Fearing the release of these men would end any hope of finding Arad, his family attempted to take legal action to prevent their release. Nothing came of this effort.|$|R
5000|$|During the Reagan administration, {{there was}} {{a return to a}} strong {{counterforce}} strategy through NSDD-13. This included development of strategic weapons systems that were more accurate, more survivable, or both. Some of these systems eventually took the role of <b>bargaining</b> <b>chips</b> in arms control negotiations, although some, such as the B-2 [...] "stealth" [...] bomber remained highly classified as potential surprises in war. The B-2 was also seen as a counter to Soviet deployment of mobile missiles, which only a manned bomber could find and attack.|$|R

25|$|Thus, by {{the evening}} of the 26th, the {{uprising}} had resulted in a stalemate. The Emperor and Sugiyama's opposition had prevented the achievement of its primary goal: the appointment of a military-dominated cabinet centered around Mazaki. Although they had managed to achieve a degree of official recognition for their actions, it was obvious that they could not occupy their positions indefinitely. Their presence was their strongest <b>bargaining</b> <b>chip,</b> but even their supporters felt that it needed to end.|$|E

5000|$|In the [...] "evil empire" [...] speech, {{which also}} dealt with {{domestic}} issues, Reagan {{made the case}} for deploying NATO nuclear-armed missiles in Western Europe {{as a response to the}} Soviets installing new nuclear-armed missiles in Eastern Europe. Eventually, the NATO missiles were set up and used as <b>bargaining</b> <b>chips</b> in arms talks with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, who took office in 1985. In 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev agreed to go further than a nuclear freeze. In an Atomic Age first, they agreed to reduce nuclear arsenals. Intermediate- and shorter-range nuclear missiles were eliminated.|$|R

25|$|Students {{began the}} hunger strike on 13 May, two {{days prior to}} the highly publicized state visit by Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev.

Moreover, the hunger strike gained widespread sympathy from the population at large and earned the student movement the moral high ground that it sought. By the afternoon of 13 May, some 300,000 were gathered at the Square.|$|E
25|$|Polio {{vaccination}} {{efforts have}} also faced resistance in another form.

In Nigeria this has taken the form of 'block rejection' of vaccination, which is only resolved when state officials agree to repair or improve schools and health-care facilities, pave roads or install electricity. There have been several instances of threatened boycotts by health workers in Pakistan over payment disputes.|$|E
50|$|Norway {{asserted}} {{its claim}} of sovereignty over the Sverdrup Islands. The islands are named after Norwegian explorer Otto Sverdrup, who explored and mapped them from 1898 to 1902 with the vessel Fram, although some were previously inhabited by Inuit people. Sverdrup claimed the islands for Norway, but the Norwegian government showed {{no interest in}} pursuing the claim until 1928.
