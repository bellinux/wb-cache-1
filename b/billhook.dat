25|$|Their curiosity piqued by {{news of the}} murder, four local {{teenagers}} {{break into}} the seemingly deserted mansion. Shy teen Bobby (Robert Bonnani) stays behind in the house while his date Brunhilda (Brigitte Skay) skinny-dips in the bay. She has barely begun her swim when Donati's rotting corpse rises from the water and collides with the nude girl. Terrified, Brunhilda rushes {{out of the water}} towards the mansion only before the unseen assailant catches up and murders her with a <b>billhook.</b> After Bobby is killed with the <b>billhook</b> slammed into his face, the killer takes a spear and impales Duke (Guido Boccaccini) and his girlfriend Denise (Paola Rubens) while they have sex.|$|E
25|$|A three-mile {{ridge of}} high ground {{branches}} off north-east from the Fairfield horseshoe at Hart Crag. It turns gradually more northward, resembling a <b>billhook</b> in plan. To {{the north is}} Deepdale, a long curving valley with a marshy and rather dismal character. The southern boundary of Hartsop above How is formed by Dovedale, a valley of woodlands and waterfalls. Both dales meet the main valley of Kirkstone/Goldrill Beck which flows north through Patterdale to Ullswater.|$|E
2500|$|While most slasher movies owe a {{considerable}} debt to Bays somewhat nonsensical narrative and {{its emphasis on}} bodily mutilation, at least one film was directly imitative: Friday the 13th Part 2 notoriously copied two of Bava's murder sequences almost shot for shot: one character is slammed {{in the face with}} a panga machete (even though Bava's film had a <b>billhook</b> and not a machete), and two teenage lovers are interrupted when a spear impales both of them. Along with The Burning, Just Before Dawn (1981) and several other similarly-plotted slashers, Friday specifically [...] "followed Bava's inspired cue, having young people stalked by violent death amid beautiful wooded settings." ...|$|E

60|$|Flanagan, {{standing}} in his stirrups, attempted to harangue the mob. But {{he was at a}} loss what to say that would appease them, nor able to speak a language they could understand. An angry peasant made a slash at him with a <b>billhook.</b> He parried the blow on his sabre, and with the flat of it knocked his assailant senseless.|$|E
60|$|On {{leaving her}} house, Mrs. Charmond had walked on and onward under the fret and fever {{of her mind}} with more vigor than she was {{accustomed}} to show in her normal moods--a fever which the solace of a cigarette did not entirely allay. Reaching the coppice, she listlessly observed Marty at work, threw away her cigarette, and came near. Chop, chop, chop, went Marty's little <b>billhook</b> with never more assiduity, till Mrs. Charmond spoke.|$|E

50|$|Usage of <b>billhooks</b> also {{varies from}} country to country - in Sweden they were often used for cutting fodder for {{livestock}} (in the UK a gorse or furze hook would have been used); in France and Italy they were widely used for pruning vines (only recently has wine making come back to the UK), and miniature <b>billhooks</b> were used for harvesting grapes during the 'vendange' in France; in the Netherlands they were often used in a carpenter's workshop (in the UK use of a small hand axe was more common), and they were also found in the coopers' workshops in France (known as a cochoir, and used in the making of wooden barrel hoops). In the Balkans they were used for harvesting maize. In Finland they are used to cut branches from trees and cutting down small trees (known as vesuri). Images of <b>billhooks</b> often appear on coats of arms of towns and villages (particularly in winemaking areas of Alsace, the Black Forest, Hungary and Switzerland) and have been found carved into boundary stones in parts of Germany and onto rock faces in Italy.|$|R
6000|$|He went out, {{and when}} {{afternoon}} came he returned, took a <b>billhook</b> from the woodman's shed, {{and with a}} ladder climbed into {{the lower part of}} the tree, where he began lopping off--"shrouding," [...] as they called it at Hintock--the lowest boughs. Each of these quivered under his attack, bent, cracked, and fell into the hedge. Having cut away the lowest tier, he stepped off the ladder, climbed a few steps higher, and attacked those at the next level. Thus he ascended with the progress of his work far above the top of the ladder, cutting away his perches as he went, and leaving nothing but a bare stem below him.|$|E
6000|$|I saw {{no more of}} him {{for nearly}} a week. When next I met him it was in Gracechurch Street with a <b>billhook</b> chained to his waist. Business took him over London Bridge and I {{accompanied}} him. He was very full {{of the importance of}} that book and magnified it. As we passed over the Thames we paused to look at a steamer unloading great slabs of white and brown marble. A barge drifted under the steamer's stern and a lonely cow in that barge bellowed. Charlie's face changed {{from the face of the}} bank-clerk to that of an unknown and--though he would not have believed this--a much shrewder man. He flung out his arm across the parapet of the bridge and laughing very loudly, said: ...|$|E
6000|$|Each tree {{doomed to}} this flaying process was first {{attacked}} by Creedle. With a small <b>billhook</b> he carefully freed {{the collar of}} the tree from twigs and patches of moss which incrusted it to a height of {{a foot or two}} above the ground, an operation comparable to the [...] "little toilet" [...] of the executioner's victim. After this it was barked in its erect position to a point as high as a man could reach. If a fine product of vegetable nature could ever be said to look ridiculous it was the case now, when the oak stood naked-legged, and as if ashamed, till the axe-man came and cut a ring round it, and the two Timothys finished the work with the crosscut-saw.|$|E

60|$|He {{started at}} a brisk run after them, and speedily {{came up to the}} last of the party. They were for the most part men between twenty and thirty, rough and {{strongly}} built, and armed with <b>billhooks</b> and heavy bludgeons, two or three of them carrying guns.|$|R
50|$|Cultivation {{was done}} with wooden ploughs {{reinforced}} with iron ploughshares, of which a number {{have been found in}} the houses of the town. Other agricultural tools found at the site include <b>billhooks,</b> sickles, hoes and rakes, forming one of the most complete tool assemblages known for pre-Roman agriculture in Spain.|$|R
60|$|Her coldness {{had been}} kindly meant. If {{it was to}} be done, she had said to herself, it should be begun at once. While she stood out of {{observation}} Giles seemed to recognize her meaning; with a sudden start he worked on, climbing higher, and cutting himself off more and more from all intercourse with the sublunary world. At last he had worked himself so high up the elm, and the mist had so thickened, that he could only just be discerned as a dark-gray spot on the light-gray sky: he would have been altogether out of notice but for the stroke of his <b>billhook</b> and the flight of a bough downward, and its crash upon the hedge at intervals.|$|E
60|$|Then {{the tree}} seemed to shiver, then to heave a sigh; a {{movement}} was audible, and Winterborne dropped almost noiselessly to the ground. He had thought the matter out, and having returned {{the ladder and}} <b>billhook</b> to their places, pursued his way homeward. He would not allow this incident to affect his outer conduct {{any more than the}} danger to his leaseholds had done, and went to bed as usual. Two simultaneous troubles do not always make a double trouble; and thus it came to pass that Giles's practical anxiety about his houses, which would have been enough to keep him awake half the night at any other time, was displaced and not reinforced by his sentimental trouble about Grace Melbury. This severance was in truth more like a burial of her than a rupture with her; but he did not realize so much at present; even when he arose in the morning he felt quite moody and stern: as yet the second note in the gamut of such emotions, a tender regret for his loss, had not made itself heard.|$|E
60|$|Not without tears did Harry's {{faithful}} companions yield {{themselves to}} his will, {{and set out}} for Abingdon, while he, with eight or ten comrades as determined as himself, kept on west until they arrived at Bristol, where they took ship and crossed to Ireland. They landed at Waterford, and journeyed north {{until they reached the}} army, with which the Marquis of Ormonde was besieging Dublin. Nothing that Harry had seen of war in England prepared him in any way for the horrors which he beheld in Ireland. The great mass of the people there were at that time but a few degrees advanced above savages, and they carried on their war with a brutal cruelty and bloodshed which could now only be rivaled in the center of Africa. Between the Protestants and the English and Scotch settlers on the one hand, and the wild peasantry on the other, a war of something like extermination went on. Wholesale massacres took place, at which men, women, and children were indiscriminately butchered, the ferocity shown being as great upon one side as the other. In fact, beyond the possession of a few large towns, Ireland had no claim whatever to be considered a civilized country. As Harry and his comrades rode from Waterford they beheld everywhere ruined fields and burned houses; and on joining the army of the Marquis of Ormonde, Harry felt even more strongly than before the hopelessness of the struggle on which he was engaged. These bands of wild, half-clad kernes, armed with pike and <b>billhook,</b> might be brave indeed, but could do nothing against the disciplined soldiers of the Parliament. There were with Ormonde, indeed, better troops than these. Some of the companies were formed of English and Welsh Royalists. Others had been raised by the Catholic gentry of the west, and into these some sort of order and discipline had been introduced. The army, moreover, was deficient in artillery, and not {{more than one-third of the}} footmen carried firearms. Harry was, a day or two after reaching the camp of Lord Ormonde, sent off to the West to drill some of the newly-raised levies there. It was now six years since he had begun to take an active part in the war, and he was between twenty-one and twenty-two. His life of active exertion had strengthened his muscles, broadened his frame, and given a strength and vigor to his tall and powerful figure.|$|E
5000|$|On 11 June 1430 {{he participated}} in the Battle of Anthon with around 400 men armed with such prosaic devices as <b>billhooks,</b> sledge hammers, and spades. He participated {{on the side of}} the French king against Louis II of Chalon-Arlay, Prince of Orange and a vassal of Philip the Good.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>billhooks</b> (for {{example the}} Kent pattern) have a single-bevelled blade, {{available}} in both right- and left-handed versions, others (such as the Machynlleth pattern) have dished blades (concave {{one side and}} convex the other), or a pronounced thickened nose (such as the Monmouth pattern). The reasons {{for many of these}} variations are now lost.|$|R
50|$|<b>Billhooks</b> {{are almost}} universally made from {{ordinary}} steel of a moderate carbon content. High-carbon steel {{is not often}} used since an extremely sharp and hard edge is not necessary, and a slightly lower carbon content makes the hook easier to sharpen in the field. Hygiene and cosmetic appearance are unimportant so more expensive stainless steel is not used.|$|R
60|$|I boated to the Holy Port in 1862, when Messieurs Blandy's {{steamship}} Falcon {{was not in}} existence. And now as the Luso steamed along shore, no external change appeared. A {{bird's-eye view}} of the islet suggests a podão or Madeiran <b>billhook,</b> about six miles by three. The tool's broken point is the Ilha da Cima, facing to north-east, a contorted pile which resembles a magnified cinder. The handle is the Ilheu Baixo, to the south; and the blade is the tract of yellow sandy lowlands--the sole specimen of its sort in the Madeiras--connecting the extremities. Three tall cones at once disclose vulcanism; the Pico de Facho, or Beacon Peak (1,660 feet), the Pico de Anna Ferreira (910 feet), and the sugarloaf Pico de Castello (1,447 feet). The latter rises immediately north of the single town, and its head still shows in white points {{the ruins of the}} fort which more than once saved the population from the 'Moors.' The lower levels are terraced, as usual in this archipelago, and the valleys are green with vines and cereals. The little white Villa Baleira is grouped around its whiter church, and dotted with dark vegetation, trees, and houses, straggling off into open country. Here lodge the greater part of the islanders, now nearly 1,750 souls. The population is far too thick. But the law of Portugal has, till lately, forbidden emigration to the islanders unless a substitute for military service be provided; the force consists of only 250 men, and the term of service is three years; yet a remplaçant costs upwards of 50l. Every emigrant was, therefore, an energetic stowaway, who landed at Honolulu or Demerara without shoes and stockings, and returned in a few years with pounds sterling enough to purchase an estate and a pardon. Half-a-dozen boats, some of them neat little feluccas with three masts, are drawn up on the beach: there is not much fishing; the vine-disease has raged, and the staple export consists of maize in some quantities; of cantaria, a grey trachyte which works more freely than the brown or black basalt, and of an impure limestone from Ilheu Baixo, the only calcaire used in Funchal. This rock is apparently an elevated coral-reef: it also produces moulds of sea-shells, delicately traced and embedded in blocks of apparently unbroken limestone. Of late a fine vein of manganese has been found in the northern or mountainous part of the island: specimens shown to me by Mr. J. Blandy appeared remarkably rich.|$|E
5000|$|The tool has {{developed}} a large variety of names {{in different parts of}} Britain, including bill, hedging bill, hand bill, hook bill, <b>billhook,</b> billook, brishing hook and broom hook. In American English a <b>billhook</b> may sometimes be referred to as a [...] "fascine knife".|$|E
50|$|The fess {{with two}} {{chequered}} rows (“countercompony”) is {{a reference to}} the village’s former allegiance to the County of Sponheim, while the charge above this, the plough, symbolizes Ippenschied’s status as a farming village. The other charge, the <b>billhook</b> (actually, the German blazon specifies a “clearing knife” that looks like a <b>billhook),</b> is a canting element, for one word used in German for a <b>billhook</b> is Hippe, suggesting {{the first part of the}} name “Ippenschied” (although in German, as in English, the letter H is pronounced).|$|E
5000|$|Many weapons {{fit into}} {{multiple}} categories, or fit in between them; many polearms such as halberds, lucerne hammers and [...] add edged and blunt methods of attack to a spear base, and various hooked weapons such as <b>billhooks,</b> , falxes and [...] evade easy classification; while flexible weapons such as whips don't fall {{into any of}} these categories.|$|R
50|$|<b>Billhooks</b> {{would have}} once {{been made by}} the local smith to the user's {{specifications}} but now sizes and shapes are largely standardised. The handles are mostly rat-tail tang, except the Yorkshire having such a long handle that a tang is just not practical - they have a socket instead. The smaller hooks have variations {{in the shape of the}} handle: round, oval and pistol-grip.|$|R
5000|$|The blade {{is usually}} {{made from a}} medium-carbon steel in varying weights and lengths, but {{typically}} 20 to 25 cm long. Blades are straight near the handle but have an increasingly strong curve towards the end. The blade is generally sharpened only {{on the inside of}} the curve, but double-edged <b>billhooks,</b> or [...] "broom hooks", also have a straight secondary edge on the back.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>billhook's</b> use as {{a cutting}} tool {{goes back to the}} Bronze Age, and a few {{examples}} survive from this period - for example found in the sea around Greece.

50|$|A general {{order of}} 1856 allowed for one pioneer per company in each regiment. The tools {{carried by the}} pioneers {{included}} a sawback sword, pickaxe, <b>billhooks,</b> shovels, and axes. In the modern era, the Pioneer Sergeant carries an axe on parade instead of a rifle {{and is the only}} soldier in the army who is allowed to wear a full beard, in deference to the ancient tradition. A Pioneer Sergeant can be identified by an embroidered badge of two crossed axes sewn above the Sergeant's rank chevrons on his sleeve.|$|R
5000|$|At {{this point}} the shopkeeper, having had enough, snatches the {{shopping}} list the customer has been holding to complete the order without any confusions. However, he then seems to take offence at something written on the list. He decides he cannot tolerate the customer any longer and calls his assistant from the back to complete the order. The assistant reads the list and opens a drawer of <b>billhooks,</b> asking [...] "How many would you like, one or two?" [...] (The shopkeeper likely saw that as the profanity [...] "bollocks".) ...|$|R
