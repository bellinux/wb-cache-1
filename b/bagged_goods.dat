5000|$|Mooring under a cliff to a buoy or by anchor, {{the ship}} would receive cargo down an apron chute or, later a wire chute. It usually took {{two days to}} load. All these ports were full of rocks both hidden and exposed. There were undertows and cross-rip {{currents}} and continual changing sandbars. The dog-hole operators obtained franchises to build and manage the chutes. When a ship entered a port, it moored to a buoy (often a log anchored to the bottom) and would be warped or winched into position for loading. A ship’s boat, crewed by three seamen and the second mate, carried the eight inch mooring lines to the buoy. The gravity chutes were troughs allowing cargo to be sent down a cliff to a ship. Besides <b>bagged</b> <b>goods,</b> the chutes were used to load other cargo, such as live hogs.|$|E

Whatever the chest chosen, the value treasure bags would then be added to that chest.|$|R

5000|$|The term [...] "Bug-Out Bag" [...] {{is related}} to, and {{possibly}} derived from, the [...] "bail-out bag" [...] emergency kit many military aviators carry. In the United States, the term {{refers to the}} Korean War practice of the U.S. Army designating alternative defensive positions, {{in the event that}} the units had to displace. They were directed to [...] "bug out" [...] when being overrun was imminent. The concept passed into wide usage among other military and law enforcement personnel, though the [...] "bail-out bag" [...] is as likely to include emergency gear for going into an emergency situation as for escaping an emergency. Other names for such a bag are a BOB, 72-hour kit, a grab bag, battle box, personal emergency relocation kit (PERK), go <b>bag,</b> <b>GOOD</b> <b>bag</b> (get out of Dodge), INCH bag (I'm never coming home). or quick run bag (QRB).|$|R

40|$|In {{automotive}} engineering, {{the safety}} aspect {{has been considered}} as a number one priority in {{development of a new}} vehicle. Each single system has been studied and developed in order to meet safety requirements. Instead of having air <b>bags,</b> <b>good</b> suspension systems, good handling and safe cornering, {{one of the most critical}} systems in a vehicle is the brake system. The objective of this work is to investigate and analyze the temperature distribution of rotor disc during braking operation using ANSYS Multiphysics. The work uses the finite element analysis techniques to predict the temperature distribution on the full and ventilated brake discs and to identify the critical temperature of the rotor. The analysis also gives us the heat flux distribution for the two discs...|$|R

Support vector regression (SVR), a popular method from the field of statistical machine learning, is used. Several instances of SVR are combined using different data sampling schemes (bagging and boosting). <b>Bagging</b> shows <b>good</b> performance, and proves to be more computationally efficient than training a single SVR model while reducing error. Boosting, however, does not improve results on this specific problem...|$|R

50|$|Jabez’ {{business}} judgement {{was put to}} {{the test}} {{in the run-up to the}} First World War. The company’s main export markets were Germany and Russia, but the political climate of the time made these untenable. Alternative areas for profit had to be found, and Jabez decided to diversify into other products, such as sports equipment, <b>bags,</b> travel <b>goods</b> and leather cases. The company patented a new non-tear football which was used in four FA Cup Finals, and even in the 1928 Olympic Games. During the Second World War the company began making military equipment such as gun pouches and webbing.|$|R

50|$|A zipper, zip, fly, or zip fastener, {{formerly}} known as a clasp locker, is a commonly used device for binding the edges of an opening of fabric or other flexible material, like on a garment or a bag.

Judson was an American inventor from Chicago who invented and constructed a workable zipper. The method, still in use today, is based on interlocking teeth. Initially, {{it was called the}} “hookless fastener” and was later redesigned to become more reliable.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCreating {{software}} {{with high}} quality has become difficult these {{days with the}} fact that size and complexity of the developed software is high.

In this paper, six machine learning models have been used for software quality prediction on five open source software. Varieties of metrics have been evaluated for the software including C & K, Henderson & Sellers, McCabe etc. Results show that Random Forest and <b>Bagging</b> produce <b>good</b> results while Naïve Bayes is least preferable for prediction...|$|R
5000|$|Kirkus Reviews {{praised the}} {{original}} volume as [...] "A collection of recent supersonic science fiction, {{not only from}} magazines devoted solely {{to this type of}} reading but even from nationally known periodicals". New Worlds reviewer Leslie Flood found the British hardcover to be [...] "Neither distinguished nor mediocre, but a reasonable addition to your bookshelf for future browsing". Authentic Science Fiction described the same edition as [...] "a mixed <b>bag</b> of <b>good,</b> very good, and indifferent", but found it [...] "most enjoyable". P. Schuyler Miller, reviewing the Berkley paperback, noted that Derleth was [...] "conservative and literary in his SF tastes, Lovecrafty in his fantasy".|$|R
