25|$|As {{hard drive}} prices have fallen, storage farms {{have tended to}} {{increase}} in capacity to make more data available online. This includes archival and <b>backup</b> <b>data</b> that would formerly have been saved on tape or other offline storage. The increase in online storage has increased power consumption. Reducing the power consumed by large storage arrays, while still providing the benefits of online storage, is a subject of ongoing research.|$|E
25|$|In {{part because}} of such long {{retention}} times, as well as growing Internet upload speeds, Usenet is also used by individual users to store <b>backup</b> <b>data</b> in a practice called Usenet backup, or uBackup. While commercial providers offer more easy to use online backup services, storing data on Usenet is free of charge (although access to Usenet itself may not be). The method requires the user to manually select, prepare and upload the data. Because anyone can potentially download the backup files, the data is typically encrypted. After the files are uploaded, the uploader {{does not have any}} control over them; the files are automatically copied to all Usenet providers, so there will be multiple copies of it spread over different geographical locations around the world—desirable in a backup scheme.|$|E
25|$|One or more {{cryptographic}} primitives {{are often}} used to develop a more complex algorithm, called a cryptographic system, or cryptosystem. Cryptosystems (e.g., El-Gamal encryption) are designed to provide particular functionality (e.g., public key encryption) while guaranteeing certain security properties (e.g., chosen-plaintext attack (CPA) security in the random oracle model). Cryptosystems use {{the properties of the}} underlying cryptographic primitives to support the system's security properties. Of course, as the distinction between primitives and cryptosystems is somewhat arbitrary, a sophisticated cryptosystem can be derived from a combination of several more primitive cryptosystems. In many cases, the cryptosystem's structure involves back and forth communication among two or more parties in space (e.g., between the sender of a secure message and its receiver) or across time (e.g., cryptographically protected <b>backup</b> <b>data).</b> Such cryptosystems are sometimes called cryptographic protocols.|$|E

2500|$|When Mega Man {{enters the}} Main Gate, he discovers it is {{actually}} a stasis chamber for the robot Mega Man Juno, a 3rd class bureaucratic unit from Eden, a space station orbiting above the planet. When he is accidentally awakened from his sleep by Mega Man, Juno makes many strange revelations, among them referring to Mega Man as [...] "Mega Man Trigger", and realizing that Mega Man is suffering from memory loss. Juno claims that the island's population needs to be purged {{so it will be}} more controllable, and confronts Mega Man when he tries to stop him. After a struggle, Juno is defeated and dies. Even with Juno's physical body gone, he transfers his <b>backup</b> <b>data</b> into the systems of Eden, preventing the halt of the Carbon Purification Process. Data gives new commands to the system, stopping the Purification and also deleting Juno's <b>backup</b> <b>data</b> from Eden. Data then reveals to Mega Man that he contains all of his previous memories from when he was Mega Man Trigger. Mega Man had stored his memories into Data as a way to prevent Eden from ever tampering with it. Data promises that he will restore Mega Man's memory when the time comes. The residents proclaim Mega Man a hero and the Caskett family rides off in the repaired Flutter to continue their journey.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Today, most of {{the cloud}} vendors {{provides}} Database as a service to store our application data in their server. Now Cloud computing meets the problem in <b>data</b> <b>backup.</b> The <b>data</b> <b>backup</b> is necessity when there is network or cloud service vendor failure. The important problem in the cloud computing is migrating our data from one cloud vendor to another. To changing the cloud vendor user needs <b>data</b> <b>backup.</b> Most of the cloud vendors providing these backup services at high cost, {{but it is more}} expensive for the users and IT organizations. The need of <b>data</b> <b>backup</b> services is growing rapidly and it requires a powerful <b>data</b> <b>backup</b> technique. In this paper, we explore a technique for “Data Backup and Recovery”. This technique reduces the cost of the solution and not only data protection from service failure but also makes the process of migration, much simpler. This approach eliminate the cloud vendor dependency and also avoid <b>data</b> <b>backup</b> cost. Internal drives of a legacy machine do all these at very low cost...|$|R
