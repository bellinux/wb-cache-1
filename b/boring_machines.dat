40|$|Abstract. Conventional {{control of}} tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> can't achieve the ideal effect {{because of the}} {{complexity}} of its work process, uncertainty of construction environment. In order to solve the question, the intelligent control is expected. The neural network control has many characteristics such as self-adaption, self-organization, and can modify the corresponding parameters by learning about external knowledge, so it becomes research focus of tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> control system in recent years. In this paper the advantage and disadvantage of several kinds of neural network used in the tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> control are introduced, the development trends of tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machine</b> control is predicted...|$|R

5|$|Phase 1 of the Second Avenue Line, {{which opened}} in January 2017, is entirely in Manhattan. It runs under Second Avenue from 65th Street to 105th Street, with {{stations}} at 72nd Street, 86th Street, and 96th Street. It is double-tracked along its entire length, with tracks in parallel tubes bored by tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines.</b> Each station's platforms sit between these tracks. North of 96th Street, both tracks continue as storage tracks until they end at 105th Street.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{started in}} November 1996, with the moving of {{underground}} pipes and wires around the station areas. In August 1997, work {{started at the}} depot, and in September, COMET started the first mainline work. In October and November, the two tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> (TBM), christened Liva and Bette, were delivered. They started boring each barrel of the tunnel from Islands Brygge in February 1998. The same month, the Public Transport Authority gave the necessary permits to operate a driverless metro. The section between Fasanvej and Frederiksberg is a former S-train line, and was last operated as such on 20 June 1998.|$|E
5|$|Metro {{awarded a}} $44.1 million {{contract}} {{to a joint}} venture of Atkinson and Dillingham companies to build the tunnel's 3rd Avenue segment as well as Pioneer Square station. Excavation of the station from street level began in March 1987, and the project's twin tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> reached James Street from Union Station in September. In June 1987, Atkinson-Dillingham and Metro were fined $80,000 after drilling at the station severed three electric power transmission lines, causing a day-long power outage in downtown Seattle, affecting the City Hall and Public Safety Building. Work in the tunnel station was also blamed for shaking in the City Hall and Public Safety Building, requiring monitoring equipment {{to be set up}} by Metro.|$|E

5|$|Excavation of the {{downtown}} bus tunnel began in early 1987, and construction reached the University Street area later that year. The twin tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> used to excavate the tunnel reached University Street in October 1987, and continued north towards Westlake station. In December, Metro agreed to pay $2.4 million to real estate developer Marathon Company for use of a city block they owned adjacent to the station for equipment staging and storage, delaying the planned construction of office buildings on the site. During excavation and construction of the University Street tunnel station, cracks and minor settling {{were found in the}} historic Seattle Tower, located nearby. The ground around the tower was later stabilized to prevent additional settlement, and was renovated with private funding in 1990.|$|E
5|$|The Downtown Transit Project {{subcommittee}} unanimously approved Metro {{recommendations that}} would {{reduce the number of}} bus tunnel stations from six to five, saving $35 million, as well as opting for tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> for the 3rd Avenue segment to minimize surface-level disruptions that would be present from cut-and-cover excavation. Stations would be located at Union Station south of Jackson Street, under 3rd Avenue and James Street, under 3rd Avenue and University Street, at the Westlake Mall and at 9th Avenue and Pine Street near the Washington State Convention Center. The Metro Council approved the station sites and use of tunnel-boring machines in July 1985, proceeding with final design by approving a $25.9 million contract with Parsons Brinckerhoff for engineering work related to the project.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable geologic formation and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel <b>boring</b> <b>machines</b> (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
