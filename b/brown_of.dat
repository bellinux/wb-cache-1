5|$|Jorge F. Guillemín {{cleared the}} ruins in 1956, mapped the {{surviving}} structures, {{as well as}} mapping the central K'iche' region and Q'umarkaj's satellite sites. The State University of New York at Albany spent three seasons excavating the ruins in the early 1970s. Kenneth <b>Brown</b> <b>of</b> the University of Houston started major excavations at Q'umarkaj in 1977.|$|E

Tabarie Henry ran the event in 45.19seconds, ending seventh out of eight athletes in the heat, at 0.13seconds behind Cuba's Williams Collazo (6th place) and 0.45seconds ahead of Italy's Claudio Licciardello (8th place). Overall, Henry ranked 17th out of 24 athletes, and did not progress to finals on August 21.|$|E
5|$|Bethe {{continued}} to do research on supernovae, neutron stars, black holes, and other problems in theoretical astrophysics into his late nineties. In doing this, he collaborated with Gerald E. <b>Brown</b> <b>of</b> Stony Brook University. In 1978, Brown proposed that they collaborate on supernovae. These were reasonably well understood by this time, but the calculations were still a problem. Using techniques honed from decades of working with nuclear physics, and some experience with calculations involving nuclear explosions, Bethe tackled the problems involved in stellar gravitational collapse, {{and the way in}} which various factors affected a supernova explosion. Once again, he was able to reduce the problem to a set of differential equations, and solve them.|$|E

5|$|Finally, Putnam's {{internal}} realism {{has been}} accused by Curtis <b>Brown</b> <b>of</b> being a disguised form of subjective idealism. If this is the case, it {{is subject to the}} traditional arguments against that position. In particular, it falls into the trap of solipsism. That is, if existence depends on experience, as subjective idealism maintains, and if one's consciousness were to stop existing, then the rest of the universe would stop existing as well.|$|E
5|$|Haumea, minor-planet {{designation}} 136108 Haumea, is a dwarf planet located beyond Neptune's orbit. It {{was discovered}} in 2004 by a team headed by Mike <b>Brown</b> <b>of</b> Caltech at the Palomar Observatory in the United States and independently in 2005, by a team headed by José Luis Ortiz Moreno at the Sierra Nevada Observatory in Spain, though the latter claim has been contested. On September 17, 2008, it was recognized as a dwarf planet by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) and named after Haumea, the Hawaiian goddess of childbirth.|$|E

In December, during the 30th United States Congress, Davis was made a regent of the Smithsonian Institution and began serving on the Committee on Military Affairs and the Library Committee.|$|E

However controversy followed in a match against Nottinghamshire. In the first innings, Woodfull scored 81 as Australia batted first and made 237. Bill Voce, {{one of the}} bodyline practitioners of 1932–33, employed it with the wicket-keeper standing to the leg side and took 8/66. In the second innings, Voce repeated the tactic late in the day, in fading light against Woodfull and Bill <b>Brown.</b> <b>Of</b> his 12 balls, 11 were no lower than head height.|$|E
5|$|Michigan, led by {{the young}} and hot-headed Mason, responded {{with the passage of}} the Pains and Penalties Act just six days after Lucas County was formed; the act made it a {{criminal}} offense for Ohioans to carry out governmental actions in the Strip, under penalty of a fine up to $1,000, up to five years imprisonment at hard labor, or both. Acting as commander-in-chief of the territory, Mason appointed Brigadier-General Joseph W. <b>Brown</b> <b>of</b> the Third U.S. Brigade to head the state militia, with the instructions to be ready to act against Ohio trespassers. Lucas obtained legislative approval for a militia of his own, and he soon sent forces to the Strip area. The Toledo War had begun.|$|E

According to Peter <b>Brown</b> <b>of</b> GameSpot, however, the main criticisms of the game were the stationary Jedi and abstract combat, for the opposite of which action fans were expecting.|$|E
