For algorithm evaluation, a simulator was developed to generate noise-limited multifrequency complex digital signal realizations with representative orbital dynamics and propagation disturbances. A frequency-tracking procedure is used to capture the slowly changing frequency component. Dynamic demodulation against the low-frequency estimate captures the scintillation.

40|$|In {{the autumn}} of the year 2000, four radio {{receivers}} capable of tracking various <b>beacon</b> <b>satellites</b> were set up along the southwestern coast of Greenland. They are used to reconstruct images of the ionospheric plasma density distribution via the tomographic method. In order to test and validate tomographic imaging under the highly variable conditions often prevailing in the high-latitude ionosphere, a time interval was selected when the Sondrestrom incoherent scatter radar conducted measurements of the ionospheric plasma density while the radio receivers tracked a number of <b>beacon</b> <b>satellites.</b> A comparison between two-dimensional images of the plasma density distribution obtained from the radar and the satellite receivers revealed generally good agreement between radar measurements and tomographic images. Observed discrepancies {{can be attributed to}} F region plasma patches moving through the field of view with a speed of several hundred meters per second, thereby smearing out the tomographic image. A notable mismatch occurred around local magnetic midnight when a magnetospheric substorm breakup occurred in the vicinity of southwest Greenland (identified from ground-based magnetometer observations). The breakup was associated with a sudden intensification of the westward auroral electrojet which was centered at about 69 and extended up to some 73 corrected geomagnetic latitude. Ground-based magnetometer data may thus have the potential of indicating when the tomographic method is at risk and may fail.

40|$|During the <b>Beacon</b> <b>Satellite</b> Symposium, held in Trieste, Italy, between June 26 and July 1 2016, the JRC {{chaired the}} session 5 B: Radio Occultation Techniques and Measurements. The {{corresponding}} abstract {{of the session}} is provided as follows: Since the mid- 1960 s, the GNSS based radio occultation technique {{has been used to}} study the structure and properties of the atmospheres of not only Earth but also other planets, such as Venus, Mars, some other outer planets, and many of their moons. By measuring the phase delay of radio waves from GNSS satellites as they are occulted by the Earth’s atmosphere, the vertical density profiles of the bending angles of radio wave trajectories can be estimated using measurements onboard LEO satellites. The success of the GPS/MET mission in 1995 inspired a number of follow‐on missions that include radio occultation experiment, including the CHAMP, GRACE, SAC-C, COSMIC, Metop-A/B, C/NOFS, and upcoming COSMIC- 2 satellites. The combined profiles from these different LEO satellites provide excellent opportunities to explore the dynamics and structure of the ionosphere, especially in the regions that have been devoid of ground-based instruments, allowing for investigation of the longitudinal variability of the ionospheric density structure. This session seeks contributions that advance the application of RO technique for space weather studies. In addition, we welcome presentations exploring innovative methodologies that address the current problem on RO inversion technique at the equatorial region where ionospheric irregularity, such as sporadic E and spread F, present and degrade the linear combination technique that affect the quality of density profile extracted in the region.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{measurement}} of Doppler frequency shift of ionospheric signal - HF Doppler technique - is one of well-known and widely used methods of ionosphere research. It allows to research various disturbances in the ionosphere. There are some sources of disturbances in the ionosphere.

This method allows {{to find out the}} influence of earthquakes, explosions and other processes on the ionosphere, which occur near to the Earth. HF Doppler technique has the high sensitivity to small frequency variations and the high time resolution, but interpretation of results is difficult.

40|$|A space-based {{satellite}} system suited for long-term {{monitoring of the}} Earth's ionosphere/plasmasphere systems is proposed.

It takes advantage of the geometrical relationship between the orbit of geostationary satellites and the position of the plasmapause region characterized by a steep electron density gradient. A combination of geostationary and nongeostationary satellites may explore the three-dimensional structure of the plasmasphere. Taking into account plasmaspheric characteristics some criteria for an effective arrangement of the satellites are derived and discussed. Since the plasmapause position is very sensitive to changes or distortions in the solar wind and the related geomagnetic activity, a continuous monitoring of the position of the plasmapause would be helpful in understanding solar-terrestrial relationships...|$|R

The mapped GPS TEC values were compared with the Faraday rotation measurements. Because GPS transmitter offsets are different for each satellite and because some GPS receiver offsets were uncalibrated, the sums of the satellite and receiver offsets were estimated simultaneously with the TEC in a least squares procedure. The accuracy of this estimation procedure is evaluated indicating that the error of the GPS-determined line of sight TEC can be at or below 1 x 10 to the 16 th el/sq cm. Consequently, the current level of accuracy is comparable to the Faraday rotation technique; however, GPS provides superior sky coverage...|$|E
40|$|We {{validate}} two-dimensional ionospheric tomography reconstructions against EISCAT incoherent scatter radar measurements. Our tomography {{method is}} based on Bayesian statistical inversion with prior distribution given by its mean and covariance. We employ ionosonde measurements for {{the choice of the}} prior mean and covariance parameters and use the Gaussian Markov random fields as a sparse matrix approximation for the numerical computations. This results in a computationally efficient tomographic inversion algorithm with clear probabilistic interpretation. We demonstrate how this method works with simultaneous <b>beacon</b> <b>satellite</b> and ionosonde measurements obtained in northern Scandinavia. The performance is compared with results obtained with a zero-mean prior and with the prior mean taken from the International Reference Ionosphere 2007 model. In validating the results, we use EISCAT ultra-high-frequency incoherent scatter radar measurements as the ground truth for the ionization profile shape. We find that in comparison to the alternative prior information sources, ionosonde measurements improve the reconstruction by adding accurate information about the absolute value and the altitude distribution of electron density.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} observational {{evidence of}} frequent ionospheric perturbations {{caused by the}} magnetar flare of the source SGR J 1550 – 5418, which took place on 22  January  2009. These ionospheric perturbations are observed in the relative change of the total electron content (ΔTEC/Δ t) measurements from the coherent ionospheric Doppler radar (CIDR). The CIDR system makes high-precision measurements of the total electron content (TEC) change along ray-paths from ground receivers to low Earth-orbiting (LEO) beacon spacecraft. These measurements can be integrated along the orbital track of the <b>beacon</b> <b>satellite</b> to construct the relative spatial, not temporal, TEC profiles that are useful for determining the large-scale plasma distribution. The observed spatial TEC changes reveal many interesting features of the magnetar signatures in the ionosphere.

The nighttime small-scale perturbations detected by CIDR, with ΔTEC/Δ t  [*]≥[*]  0. 05  TECU s − 1, over the eastern Mediterranean on 22  January  2009 were synchronized with the onset phase of the magnetar flare and consistent with the emission of hundreds of bursts detected from the source.

40|$|Two {{research}} subjects: (1) excitation of "forced ion acoustic waves", and (2) "simultaneous excitation of {{plasma density}} fluctuations and geomagnetic field fluctuations" {{are reported in}} my M. S. thesis. The data was acquired in our experiments conducted at Gakona, Alaska from summer 2007 to winter 2008, using DoD/NSF-funded HAARP facilities and our own optical (ASIS) and radio instruments (VLF receiving system of IRIS) aided by GPS satellites as well as AMISR radar at Poker Flat, Alaska. We suggest that "Forced ion acoustic waves" detected by MUIR radar on Oct. 29 during 6 : 20 - 6 : 30 UT arise from keV electron precipitation associated with the occurrence of green aurora. Our work shows, for the first time, that MUIR radar is suitable for probing naturally occurring space plasma processes and not limited to HF heater-induced effects. This would extend the usage of MUIR for the investigation of space weather together with AMISR radar at Poker Flat, to advance our knowledge in space plasma turbulence. The research on "simultaneous excitation of plasma density fluctuations and geomagnetic field fluctuations" {{is an extension of}} my B. S. thesis research on thermal filamentation instability, which started in our summer Gakona experiments in 2005. Large plasma sheets (also known as sheet-like filaments) can be excited by HF O-mode and X-mode heater waves via thermal filamentation instability. (cont.) The dominant nonlinearity is provided by the differential Joule heating acting on electrons, which subsequently gives rise to a cross-field thermal pressure force, to concomitantly generate spatially varying plasma density fluctuations and geomagnetic field fluctuations. It is interesting to find that the fractional density fluctuations are approximately equal to the fractional magnetic field fluctuations. This gives us the theoretical basis to use ground-based magnetometer measurements to infer the density fluctuations in space plasma turbulence.
