5|$|A Dandie Dinmont Terrier {{is a small}} Scottish <b>breed</b> of dog in the terrier family. The <b>breed</b> has a {{very long}} body, short legs, and a {{distinctive}} topknot of hair on the head. A character in Sir Walter Scott's novel Guy Mannering has lent the name to the <b>breed,</b> with Dandie Dinmont thought {{to be based on}} James Davidson, who is credited as being the originator of the modern <b>breed.</b> Davidson's dogs descended from earlier terrier owning families, including the Allans of Holystone, Northumberland.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>breed</b> {{associations}} and the French National Stud are making {{efforts to protect}} the <b>breed,</b> very low numbers persist, and these organizations consider the <b>breed</b> very close to extinction. It {{is one of the}} most threatened French horse breeds. The production of horse meat has declined due to a decrease in consumption, and most male foals are neither selected for reproduction nor work. One author says that more alternatives to slaughter are needed and that the steady decline in <b>breed</b> numbers is proof that the <b>breed</b> is slowly disappearing. Beginning in 2011, the Trait du Nord association is working with the North Pas-de-Calais regional council and other groups to increase the number of births by 20 percent by December 2014, and double the number by 2020.|$|E

5|$|Enthusiasts {{worked to}} reorient the <b>breed</b> towards driving and {{recreation}} pursuits, and since 1982 have again reorganized the <b>breed</b> association. In 1992, a new studbook {{was created for}} the <b>breed,</b> with new selection criteria designed to preserve {{the quality of the}} <b>breed,</b> particularly its gaits. The latest editions of the <b>breed</b> registry and studbook are controlled by the Syndicat national des éleveurs et utilisateurs de chevaux Cob normand (SNEUCCN, National Union of Farmers and Users of Normandy Cob Horses), based in Tessy-sur-Vire. The association works to preserve and promote the <b>breed</b> throughout France, focusing especially on Normandy, Vendee and Anjou. In 1994, Normandy contained 2000 Percheron and Norman Cob horses, and annually bred around 600 foals of these two breeds. This included approximately half of the Norman Cobs bred in France.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{breeding}} {{programs in}} the early 20th century succeeded in re-establishing the <b>breed</b> to some extent, but mechanization, combined with two world wars, again resulted in the <b>breed</b> almost becoming extinct. In the 1980s, concerned with the declining population numbers, interested breeders undertook a promotional program, which resulted in renewed interest in the <b>breed.</b> By the 1990s, population numbers were higher, and genetic studies in 1998 and 2012 found relatively high levels of genetic diversity for a small <b>breed.</b> However, livestock conservation organizations still consider the <b>breed</b> to be at risk, due to low population numbers.|$|E

In order to combat glaucoma in the <b>breed,</b> the <b>breed</b> clubs recommend that Dandies should have a procedure called a gonioscopy performed on them at regular intervals throughout their lives. The Dandie is also at slightly higher risk of canine cancer than average. The average life expectancy of a Dandie Dinmont Terrier is 1113 years.|$|E
5|$|French {{breeding}} of the Mérens is divided between two schools of thought.

The second comes from {{the conversion of the}} Mérens to a leisure horse in the 1980s, and aims to transform the physical type of the <b>breed</b> into a more sports-oriented horse to ensure the survival of the <b>breed.</b> This dichotomy has become a source of tension between farmers and users of the <b>breed.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1977, the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association was {{established}} to promote the Manipuri pony <b>breed</b> and the game of polo. In recent years, <b>breed</b> numbers have decreased, and estimates place the <b>breed</b> at somewhere between 2,300 and 1,000 in population in the 21st century. Population numbers continue to dwindle {{in part due to}} high numbers of ponies being smuggled into Myanmar (Burma), where the <b>breed</b> is in demand, after either having been purchased or stolen from their Indian owners. In 2005, a heritage park was begun by the Manipur Horse Riding and Polo Association with the goal of preventing the extinction of the <b>breed</b> and promoting them to tourists.|$|E

40|$|Background: One of {{the most}} {{economically}} important areas within the Welsh agricultural sector is sheep farming, contributing around ? 230 million to the UK economy annually. Phenotypic selection over several centuries has generated a number of native sheep <b>breeds,</b> which are presumably adapted to the diverse and challenging landscape of Wales. Little {{is known about the}} history, genetic diversity and relationships of these <b>breeds</b> with other European <b>breeds.</b> We genotyped 353 individuals from 18 native Welsh sheep <b>breeds</b> using the Illumina OvineSNP 50 array and characterised the genetic structure of these <b>breeds.</b> Our genotyping data were then combined with, and compared to, those from a set of 74 worldwide <b>breeds,</b> previously collected during the International Sheep Genome Consortium HapMap project. Results: Model based clustering of the Welsh and European <b>breeds</b> indicated shared ancestry. This finding was supported by multidimensional scaling analysis (MDS), which revealed separation of the European, African and Asian <b>breeds.</b> As expected, the commercial Texel and Merino <b>breeds</b> appeared to have extensive co-ancestry with most European <b>breeds.</b> Consistently high levels of haplotype sharing were observed between native Welsh and other European <b>breeds.</b> The Welsh <b>breeds</b> did not, however, form a genetically homogeneous group, with pairwise FST between <b>breeds</b> averaging 0. 107 and ranging between 0. 020 and 0. 201. Four subpopulations were identified within the 18 native <b>breeds,</b> with high homogeneity observed amongst the majority of mountain <b>breeds.</b> Recent effective population sizes estimated from linkage disequilibrium ranged from 88 to 825. Conclusions: Welsh <b>breeds</b> are highly diverse with low to moderate effective population sizes and form at least four distinct genetic groups. Our data suggest common ancestry between the native Welsh and European <b>breeds.</b> These findings provide the basis for future genome- wide association studies and a first step towards developing genomics assisted breeding strategies in the UK. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R

5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids <b>breed</b> once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, <b>breed</b> on a nine-month schedule. Among those that <b>breed</b> annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species <b>breed</b> in a fixed season while others <b>breed</b> all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that <b>breed</b> at higher latitudes always <b>breed</b> in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species <b>breed</b> continuously. Some species <b>breed</b> seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, <b>breed</b> seasonally for reasons unknown.
