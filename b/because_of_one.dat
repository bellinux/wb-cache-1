5|$|Eclipsing {{variables}} are star systems that vary in brightness <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> star passing {{in front of}} the other rather than from any intrinsic change in luminosity. W Ursae Minoris is one such system, its magnitude ranging from 8.51 to 9.59 over 1.7 days. The combined spectrum of the system is A2V, but the masses of the two component stars are unknown. A slight change in the orbital period in 1973 suggests there is a third component of the multiple star system—most likely a red dwarf—with an orbital period of 62.2±3.9 years. RU Ursae Minoris is another example, ranging from 10 to 10.66 over 0.52days. It is a semidetached system, as the secondary star is filling its Roche lobe and transferring matter to the primary.|$|E

25|$|In August 1851, 40 Americans {{who took}} part in Narciso López's {{filibustering}} expedition in Cuba, including William L. Crittenden, were executed by Spanish authorities in Havana. In 1854, a secret proposal known as the Ostend Manifesto was devised by U.S. diplomats, interested in adding a slave state to the Union. The Manifesto proposed buying Cuba from Spain for $130 million. If Spain were to reject the offer, the Manifesto implied that, in the name of Manifest Destiny, war would be necessary. When the plans became public, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> author's vocal enthusiasm for the plan, the manifesto caused a scandal, and was rejected, in part because of objections from anti-slavery campaigners.|$|E

500|$|In August 2013 Purina {{recalled}} {{some of its}} Purina ONE Beyond dog food, <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> {{bag that}} was found to contain salmonella. In 2012 a consumer sued Nestlé Purina Petcare when his pet died after eating Waggin' Train treats. The Food and Drug Administration received more than 900 reports from grieving pet owners that alleged the treat was causing illness or death in their pets due to chicken products from China. The FDA had issued warnings regarding these ingredients, but lab tests repeatedly confirmed there were no contaminants. Later that year, another consumer started a petition on Change.org asking retailers to voluntarily stop carrying the product. The petition attracted 60,000 signatures. The following year, Waggin' Train and Canyon Creek dog treats were voluntarily taken off the market temporarily after the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets identified trace amounts of antibiotic residue, which is allowed in Europe and China, but not approved in the US.

500|$|Critical {{response}} to the Gin Tama manga has generally been positive.

Jokes regarding clichés from other shōnen series were also positively received by About.com writer Deb Aoki, who, like Santos, found the artwork to be [...] "the only thing that distracts from the otherwise considerable pleasures of this loveable, goofy manga". However, characters' designs were praised for its variations including the ones from the aliens appearing in the series by Katherine Dacey from Pop Culture Shock who remarked that [...] "These characters add visual interest and life to every panel, keeping the reader invested when the stories stall." [...] Other negative comments regarding the manga have the few number of aliens appearing in the series {{as well as how}} some chapters are focused in fights such as Hijikata's fight against Gintoki. Michael Aronson from Manga Life concluded his review of the manga by saying that [...] "The potential is there, but the execution is struggling" [...] as still he liked the comedy from the story. Comics Village's Alex Hoffman mentioned that Gin Tama [...] "can't truly be compared to those comics <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>one</b> thing: the jokes."
