50|$|Armos {{are living}} statue enemies. According to The Minish Cap, {{they were created}} to guard the Wind Tribe, {{and there is a}} Minish-sized chamber inside them where they can be turned on or off. They {{typically}} pose as statues or suits of armor, but attack when approached. Some Armos statues are inanimate and can be moved like blocks. There is a larger, stronger variety of Armos known as Armos Knights, which first appeared as a collective boss in A Link to the Past. In the The Wind Waker, both the standard Armos and the Armos Knights appear as common enemies. To defeat the standard Armos, an arrow had to be shot into the pink gem that was in the Armos' <b>back</b> or <b>slash</b> at it with a sword. After damaging this gem, the Armos will spin around, chasing Link for a few seconds, then explode, inflicting damage to Link if he is within range of the explosion. To defeat the Armos Knights, a bomb had to be thrown into their open mouth (which opened periodically). While the Armos Knight is dying, they, too chase Link for a few seconds before exploding. In Twilight Princess, they are hammer-wielding statues that can only be harmed from behind. There were also enemies called Titan Armos that were supposed to appear in the game but cut in the final release.|$|R

Sensing her desperation, Gambo sets off to confront the red ogre. He arrives {{at the site of}} a strange ruin, where a large half organic, half metallic craft lies smoldering amidst animal carcasses and yellow slime. Gambo enters the craft, and finds a human woman bound to a cybernetic alcove, unnaturally pregnant with several ogre-like fetuses. In a rage, Gambo rips apart the inside of the structure, causing explosions that destroy the entire craft. The ogre returns, and upon seeing his wrecked vessel, attacks Gambo in a fit of fury. The two fight, but the ogre is much stronger. Having followed the bear, the Christian samurai intervenes in their fight. Believing the ogre to be a demon, he drives a spear into its <b>back,</b> and <b>slashes</b> at it with his sword, but does little damage against its massive body. The emperor's daughter leaps out from her hiding spot, catching the ogre's attention, who runs towards her. Before he can get to her, Gambo attacks the ogre from behind, and the two wrestle on the ground. Shogunate soldiers show up, attacking the ogre with rifles and arrows, to no avail.

50|$|The battle {{starts with}} Genghis Khan, who {{is mounted on}} horseback, and 4 of his Mongol {{soldiers}} out walking on a hillside. They soon hear a strange noise and see Hannibal, who is mounted up on a war elephant and being accompanied by 4 Carthaginians: 3 foot soldiers and a single horseman. Hannibal soon makes visual contact with Genghis, and Genghis orders his men to load their bow and arrows. They aim upwards and fire, one which comes down in Hannibal's shield, and another which sticks in an unlucky Carthaginian. In retaliation, Hannibal orders his horseman to ride on and attack with Soliferrums. As he charges, one Mongol breaks from the group and charges into battle with his Jida Lance, only to be struck down {{by one of the}} Soliferrums. Khan rides off and soon returns the favor to the Carthaginian with his own Jida Lance, which one of his men hands to him. Back {{on the other side of}} the hill, Hannibal dismounts from his elephant and prods him on with a Soliferrum to charge at the Mongolians. The three Mongolians kneel down and shoot at the elephant with their recurve bow and arrows, but soon retreat as the elephant charges in, trampling one Mongolian. The Mongolians regroup and continue assaulting the elephant with arrows, firing arrows into its hide and head, and driving it away from the battlefield. Elsewhere, Khan rides in on his war horse and strikes down a Carthaginian soldier with his Turko-Mongol Saber. Meanwhile, one of the Carthaginians charges at the two remaining Mongolians, catching one's attention by throwing a Soliferrum at his head. The iron javelin is deflected by the Mongolian's shield and both men turn to face the Carthaginian. One tries to hack at him with a Mongol saber, but he deflects the blow and stabs him through his leather lamellar with his Falcata. He then tries to strike at the last Mongol's legs, but the Mongol jumps <b>back</b> and <b>slashes</b> his leg. While he is kneeling, the Mongol quickly follows up with a slash to the face, killing the Carthaginian. His victory is short-lived, however, as Hannibal comes up from behind and impales him through the chest with his Falcata. Genghis Khan soon spots Hannibal again and rides up toward him, throwing away his Mongol bow and dismounting. He walks up to him, measuring him up, and then gives a war cry while drawing his saber. Both men clash swords, which are caught by both shields. Hannibal goes for a vertical head shot with his Falcata, but Genghis shakes off the blow and slashes Hannibal across the thigh. Hannibal goes for a horizontal slash, but Genghis ducks under the sword and hits Hannibal's shield out of his hands. Tired and desperate, Hannibal deflects blows from the saber and goes for a thrust strike with the falcata, but it fails to pass through the steel lamellar armor. Enraged, Genghis counters with two consecutive head shots to Hannibal's brass helmet, severely denting it and knocking Hannibal dizzy. Genghis Khan then spins around and delivers the final strike, slashing Hannibal across the neck and cutting neck arteries. Hannibal falls down dead as The Great Khan gives a victorious shout.|$|R
5000|$|Although {{the game}} is played on a large scale, the {{designers}} were also concerned to make individual combat important. According to Gratton, [...] after I'd sorted out the technical demo to make sure it actually could be done, I started researching combat using a sword against people. What makes that cool? I'm into my third person slashers anyway, but I did some serious analysis into making every single hit with a weapon...cool. And satisfying. And giving you a buzz. So I did a lot of work into the collision model - that is, the simplest, most fundamental underlying part of combat. I researched that, so you get a buzz every time you hit or kill someone. That's the core that underlies everything. If it's a duel against one person, even if they're weak, you get to choose. You smash them in the face, then give them a couple of stabs and then they're gone ... When there's hundreds of people to kill, you tend to use power moves or intermediate rage moves, along with your standards. As the numbers dwindle, you're thinking of conserving your power-moves as there may be some rock-hard bastard around the corner or fifty people about to run out and attack you. But there's loads of fun to be had with standard moves - not just dishing out masses of power moves - and having a fight against people. Even one person is a lot of fun. After you get into combat you see there's a lot of depth there, so if there's one grunt coming towards you, you might move back, so he misses, and you can kill him in one blow. And you get a real pleasure. Or alternately he tries an attack, you drop and roll around the <b>back</b> and <b>slash</b> him to pieces from behind. [...] Gratton wanted the player to have multiple options at every point of the game; [...] we realized early on that we'd need a combat system which would allow the player to come face-to-face with a horde of enemies and have fun killing them. We also wanted fights against smaller numbers and one-on-one fights, and so we needed a very large range of techniques to dispatch enemies. Making a decision about which technique you wanted to achieve on a moment-by-moment basis as the shape of the encounter changed also seemed to be very important. This would require a combat system that gave instantaneous control of the techniques available. Eventually the marketing department would dub this [...] "action and reaction" [...] combat. [...] However, Gratton was determined to avoid the game becoming a button-masher, where the player could easily win by continually attacking. He also wanted to avoid the use of complex multi-button combos; [...] "creating a UI which was simple and yet allowed access to a large variety of clearly differentiated moves was a priority." [...] This is where the idea of radial combat came from; the attack button performs different actions depending on which shoulder button is pressed, thus allowing the player to change their strategy instantaneously in battle, whether using the sword, shield or bow. Gratton says the depth of the combat is based on [...] "finger memory," [...] with the combat system's simplicity being its strongest feature; [...] we have two consistent buttons to press for attacks and two modifiers to change your weapon from the sword: shield or bow. We quickly realized that this system could be applied to all of the attacking moves to create the simple attack UI (two buttons). Modifiers are used to create the depth of moves required. Pick up and play at its best! The skill is not in the ability to select a move - the skill comes from the user deciding what is the best move to use for a given situation.|$|R
5000|$|The battle {{begins with}} 5 relaxed French Foreign Legionnaires milling about at their campsite. Not far away, {{a squad of}} 5 Gurkhas are {{preparing}} an ambush. A legionnaire sentry relieves his fellow guardsman as the lead Gurkha cuts {{a hole in the}} legion's barbed wire fence using wire snips. The sentry watches along the perimeter of the camp site, unaware of the Gurkhas' position. A Gurkha takes aim with his Lee-Enfield No. 4 and fires, alerting the rest of the legion. The legion immediately scramble for defensive positions, firing their MAS-36 rifles and BAR machine guns while the Gurkhas fire back with their Lee-Enfields and Bren machine guns. As his position begins to crumble, the sentry attempts to leave his sandbag cover, but is shot down in the crossfire. An African legionnaire quickly re-cocks his bolt action MAS and fires, killing a Gurkha. He quickly fires off one more shot before running back for cover behind sandbags. As the rest of the small legion falls back, the Gurkhas start to advance, taking position in front of the sandbags and continuing to lay down covering fire as two Gurkhas run up through the camp, dodging small artillery fire and jumping over the barbed wire barricade. A Gurkha jumps out of cover and briefly stops to clear a jam in his Bren machine gun, but is shot by a legionnaire who gets up from his position and fires his BAR at the Gurkha. As soon as he's visible, a Gurkha behind a nearby tree shoots him in the head with his Lee-Enfield rifle. While the other Gurkhas inspect the tents for any other legionnaires, the African legionnaire pops out of cover behind sandbags and shoots one of the wandering Gurkhas in the head. The other Gurkha sniper quickly retaliates by shooting him in the head while he's still standing. As the Gurkhas draw closer to the 2 remaining legionnaires, the lead legionnaire jumps out of cover and fires his MAS at the lead Gurkha. The Gurkha takes cover behind a tent as the 2 legionnaires unload the rest of their ammo at the retreating Gurkhas. As they retreat, the lead Gurkha gestures to his partner to split up as the 2 legionnaires come charging at them. Nearby, the other legionnaire cautiously searches for his prey, aiming his rifle. The lead Gurkha sneaks up behind him and brings his kukri blade down, cutting through the legionnaire's kepi and into his skull. The other Gurkha, armed with his kukri, is also brought down from behind as the lead legionnaire grabs him from behind and stabs him in the neck with his Callimus knife. The two leaders soon confront each other near a hillside, knives in hand as a knife fight showdown ensues. Both leaders step to each other, daring the other to attack. As soon as they come closer to each other, they begin to swing at each other, with the Gurkha scoring the first strike with a backhanded cut across the left cheek. The Gurkha goes in for a follow-up strike, but the legionnaire counters with a strike across the right cheek that causes the Gurkha to stumble down the hillside. As soon as he regains his balance, the legionnaire goes in for a strike and follows up with a thrust. The Gurkha recovers and moves out of the way, causing the legionnaire's Callimus to get stuck in a log that was behind the Gurkha. As the legionnaire tries to free his knife, the Gurkha takes the opportunity to slash his opponent diagonally across the back and kick him. The legionnaire frees his knife and swings his knife 180 degrees, causing the Gurkha to jump <b>back.</b> The Gurkha <b>slashes</b> the legionnaire twice across the face. The legionnaire goes in for a thrust attack in desperation, but the Gurkha grabs his arm and stops him. He then swings his knife, slashing through the legionnaire's throat. As the legionnaire lies on the ground drawing his last breath, the Gurkha raises his arms and bloodied kukri into the air, shouting [...] "Ayo Gurkhali!" [...] (The Gurkhas are here!) in victory.|$|R
