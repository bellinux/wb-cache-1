5|$|Accounts of snaring and {{destroying}} the <b>beast</b> are rare, {{as it is}} not {{generally considered to be}} a threat. In 1819 John MacCulloch, a noted geologist, described how inhabitants around the areas of Loch Awe and Loch Rannoch tried to capture a water bull by shackling a sheep to an oak tree as an enticement, but the tackle was not strong enough. Another story describes a farmer and his two sons hunting a water bull. The farmer's musket was filled with silver sixpence coins as the <b>beast</b> can only be killed with silver.|$|E
5|$|Beauty and the <b>Beast</b> is a 1991 American {{animated}} musical romantic fantasy film {{produced by}} Walt Disney Feature Animation and released by Walt Disney Pictures. The 30th Disney animated feature film {{and the third}} released during the Disney Renaissance period, {{it is based on}} the French fairy tale of the same name by Jeanne-Marie Leprince de Beaumont (who was also credited in the English version as well as in the French version), and ideas from the 1946 French film of the same name directed by Jean Cocteau. Beauty and the <b>Beast</b> focuses on the relationship between the <b>Beast</b> (voice of Robby Benson), a prince who is magically transformed into a monster and his servants into household objects as punishment for his arrogance, and Belle (voice of Paige O'Hara), a young woman whom he imprisons in his castle. To become a prince again, <b>Beast</b> must learn to love Belle and earn her love in return to avoid remaining a monster forever. The film also features the voices of Richard White, Jerry Orbach, David Ogden Stiers, and Angela Lansbury.|$|E
5|$|Director Bill Condon {{originally}} intended to include most songs from the Broadway musical adaptation of Beauty and the <b>Beast</b> in the remake. However, Disney ultimately decided to recruit composer Alan Menken and lyricist Tim Rice to write entirely new songs for the film instead. Original Beauty and the <b>Beast</b> composer Menken reunited with Rice, {{with whom he had}} previously collaborated on Disney's animated film Aladdin (1992), to write three new songs for the remake. Rice once again replaced original Beauty and the <b>Beast</b> lyricist Howard Ashman, who had passed away shortly before the animated film's release in 1991, similar {{to the way in which}} he replaced the lyricist to aid Menken in writing new material for the 1994 stage adaptation. Menken believes that the songs he and Rice had written for the stage musical would not have translated well to the screen due to structural differences between the two formats.|$|E

5|$|Over a year {{passed before}} The <b>Beast</b> won another championship. In {{the summer of}} 1973, Sweetan was holding the ESA Tag Team Championship with Kurt von Steiger when The <b>Beast</b> teamed with Bobby Kay, {{the only one of}} his {{brothers}} with whom he had not held a tag team championship, and regained the trophy. Once again, however, Sweetan won the title back on July 31 along with partner Mr. X. During the ESA off-season, The <b>Beast</b> returned to Texas and reformed his tag team partnership with brother Leo Burke. In January 1974, the brothers defeated Don Fargo and Hank James to win the NWA Western States Tag Team Championship. Within two months, however, they lost the title to long-time rival Romero and his partner Dory Funk, Jr. Returning to the ESA, The <b>Beast</b> and Bobby Kay defeated Sweetan and Dubois to win the vacant Tag Team Championship. The reign lasted for less than one week before Sweetan and Dubois won the trophy in a rematch. The following month, The <b>Beast</b> had another short reign with the IWA North American Heavyweight Championship, winning the title and losing it back to Great Kuma in less than two weeks. He followed this with a victory for the Tag Team Championship with Burke on July 13, once again winning the title from Sweetan and Dubois.
