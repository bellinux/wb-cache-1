However, in a lengthy obiter discussion, the Court held that an objective rather than a subjective test should apply to the exercise of discretion by the authorities under sections 8 and 10 of the ISA. In other words, the executive could not insist that the exercise of the discretion was unchallengeable. The exercise of discretion could be reviewed by the court, and the executive had to satisfy the court that there were objective facts justifying its decision.|$|E

40|$|In Bilcare Ltd. v. M/S The Supreme Industries Ltd., the Delhi High Court affirmed a {{lower court}} order vacating ex parte {{injunctions}} against an alleged infringer of a patent, rejecting arguments that the patent should be presumed valid even though the patent {{was the subject of}} opposition proceedings. In KSR International, Inc. v. Teleflex Co., the U. S. Supreme Court reversed the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s long-standing interpretation of Section 103 of the Patent Act, i. e., that a challenger seeking to prove invalidity must demonstrate a teaching, suggestion, or motivation to combine prior art references. These cases reveal important insights (within varying procedural and substantive legal contexts) into statutory and judicial presumptions of validity that result from the grant of patents by administrative agencies. The article explains how such presumptions relate to evidence and proof rather than to the weight accorded to legal judgments. Using Bilcare as a reference, the article suggests that opportunities to present evidence challenging validity should be provided even in preliminary relief contexts, and discusses concerns that arise when validity is challenged in both administrative and judicial systems. The article then describes how the KSR decision adopted substantive legal rules for obviousness that supersede the statutory presumption of validity, shift the <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> production and persuasion, and (for some inventions) limit the scope of relevant evidence that can be used by patent holders to prove non-obviousness. Finally, the article argues that the U. S. statutory presumption should not continue to be construed by the courts to impose heightened <b>burdens</b> <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> invalidity...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the rights}} {{and the status of}} probationers in the context of Malaysian employment relations. A probationer is someone who is on trial to give proof of certain qualifications for a place or status in employment. The term “probation” however, is not found in any of the employment legislation in Malaysia. This means a probationer is an employee in the context of Employment Act 1955 (EA 1955) and a workman in the context of Industrial Relations Act 1955 (IRA 1967). In the employment relations, the probationary period is also an opportunity for both employer and employee to decide whether they are suited for each other. The Industrial Court and the superior courts in Malaysia have over the years ruled that an employee (also refers to workman) on probation enjoys the same rights as a permanent employee. As a result the services of a probationer cannot be terminated without just cause or excuse (Section 20, IRA 1967). Although an employer retains the right to confirm or not to confirm an employee on probation, this prerogative must be exercised in a bona fide manner not arbitrarily or capriciously and there must also be grounds for the decision. In this paper, the authors analyses some of key issues on {{the rights and}} status of probationers which also include the employers right to confirm, extend or terminate the services of a probationer. The methodology employed in this paper is the analysis of industrial case laws on probation using criterion based sampling of Industrial Court and superior court awards. Findings from the analysis reveals that many termination awards on probation were made against the employers as the employers have failed or violated the principles of natural justice in the termination of probationers. The basic principle of industrial jurisprudence in Malaysia is that it is the employer who must prove the employee (probationer) guilty, and not the employee (probationer) who must prove himself (herself) not guilty. As such, the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>prove</b> is on the employer and not on the employee (probationer) for termination cases referred to the Industrial Court. In this paper the authors also provide some recommendation in the management probationers besides other guidelines to improve and create a harmonious employment relationship...|$|R
500|$|The ratio decidendi, {{or legal}} {{point in the}} case which {{determined}} the judgment, was a narrow one. The appeals were allowed {{on the ground that}} the Minister had not discharged the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> the validity of the detention orders. Under section 8(1) of the ISA, the President's satisfaction that a person poses a national security risk is a condition precedent to the Minister's power to make a detention order. The Minister attempted to demonstrate that the President had been so satisfied before the detention order was made by pointing {{to the fact that the}} recitals in the detention orders stated that the President [...] "is satisfied", and by filing an affidavit by the Permanent Secretary to the Minister for Home Affairs which asserted that the [...] "government" [...] was satisfied that the appellants were a danger to national security. However, the Court of Appeal found that this was inadmissible evidence as it amounted to hearsay. Furthermore, as regards the affidavit, the satisfaction of the Government was not the same as the President's satisfaction.|$|E
500|$|Section 5 {{requires}} that covered jurisdictions receive federal approval, known as [...] "preclearance", before implementing changes to their election laws. A covered jurisdiction has the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> <b>proving</b> {{that the change}} {{does not have the}} purpose or effect of discriminating {{on the basis of race}} or language minority status; if the jurisdiction fails to meet this burden, the federal government will deny preclearance and the jurisdiction's change will not go into effect. The Supreme Court broadly interpreted Section 5's scope in Allen v. State Board of Election (1969), holding that any change in a jurisdiction's voting practices, even if minor, must be submitted for preclearance. The Court also held that if a jurisdiction fails to have its voting change precleared, private plaintiffs may sue the jurisdiction in the plaintiff's local district court before a three-judge panel. In these Section 5 [...] "enforcement actions", a court considers whether the jurisdiction made a covered voting change, and if so, whether the change has been precleared. If the jurisdiction improperly failed to obtain preclearance, then the court will order the jurisdiction to obtain preclearance before implementing the change. However, the court may not consider the merits of whether the change should be approved.|$|E

40|$|Type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 D) and prediabetes {{have a major}} global impact {{through high}} disease prevalence, significant downstream pathophysiologic effects, and enormous financial liabilities. To mitigate this disease <b>burden,</b> interventions <b>of</b> <b>proven</b> effectiveness must be used. Evidence shows that nutrition therapy improves glycemic control and reduces the risks of diabetes and its complications. Accordingly, diabetes-specific nutrition therapy should be incorporated into comprehensive patient management programs. Evidence-based recommendations for healthy lifestyles that include healthy eating {{can be found in}} clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) from professional medical organizations. To enable broad implementation of these guidelines, recommendations must be reconstructed to account for cultural differences in lifestyle, food availability, and genetic factors. To begin, published CPGs and relevant medical literature were reviewed and evidence ratings applied according to established protocols for guidelines. From this information, an algorithm for the nutritional management of people with T 2 D and prediabetes was created. Subsequently, algorithm nodes were populated with transcultural attributes to guide decisions. The resultant transcultural diabetes-specific nutrition algorithm (tDNA) was simplified and optimized for global implementation and validation according to current standards for CPG development and cultural adaptation. Thus, the tDNA is a tool to facilitate the delivery of nutrition therapy to patients with T 2 D and prediabetes in a variety of cultures and geographic locations. It is anticipated that this novel approach can reduce the <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> diabetes, improve quality of life, and save lives. The specific Southeast Asian and Asian Indian tDNA versions can be found in companion articles in this issue of Current Diabetes Report...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{intended}} {{to answer a question}} on the extent of the effectiveness <b>of</b> a reversal <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof as stipulated in positive (prevailing) Indonesia law, that is, as provided for in Law Number 31 of 1999 on Eradication of Corruption Crime. Then, a problem that rose next was: could the application <b>of</b> reversal <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof in <b>proving</b> a corruption crime case prevent or reduce or even eliminate totally corruption crimes in Indonesia? This research built on a theoretical frame of thought from Roscoe Pound, who maintains that law is a tool of social engineering. This concept was cited by Muchtar Kusumaatmadja, who adapted it to Indonesia conditions and transformed it to be law as a social engineering medium. Law should be made as a medium of reforming and resolving all problems that emerge in community, including corruption crimes. One of the things to reform is the law of proof system, that is, from a conventional proof system to a reversal system. This paper was written by a juridical-normative method, that is, by studying legislations, both contained in laws and in literature/books on legal science, particularly legislations relating to reversal <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof. Then, the results, in a form of juridical aspect, were written in a descriptive-analytical form. The conclusion of this research was an answer to the problems put forward above, that is: Corruption crimes have been occurring continuously till now in Indonesia. Thus, Law Number 31 of 1999, Article 37, has not been effective yet in eradicating corruption crimes. Therefore, it needs to apply a pure reversal <b>burden</b> <b>of</b> proof by avoiding the incidence of bureaucratic chaos...|$|R
