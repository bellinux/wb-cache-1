5|$|Licensed and {{unlicensed}} {{variants of}} Sega consoles {{have been produced}} by third-party companies. In Brazil, Tectoy created and released the Master System 3 Compact, which may function wirelessly with an RF transmitter. An SKU of this console targeted at female gamers, the Master System Girl, was molded in <b>bright</b> <b>pink</b> plastic. A more recent version, released in 2006 in Brazil as the Master System 3 Collection, contains 120 built-in games. Another Master System variant, built as a handheld game console, was released by Coleco in North America in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The gingiva {{surrounding}} a tooth has a 2–3mm band of <b>bright</b> <b>pink,</b> very strong attached mucosa, then a darker, larger area of unattached mucosa that folds into the cheeks. When replacing a tooth with an implant, {{a band of}} strong, attached gingiva is {{needed to keep the}} implant healthy in the long-term. This is especially important with implants because the blood supply is more precarious in the gingiva {{surrounding a}}n implant, and is theoretically more susceptible to injury because of a longer attachment to the implant than on a tooth (a longer biologic width).|$|E
5|$|She {{wanted the}} {{production}} and costume design to reflect the themes of the story. There is a progression from the organic world of Megan's hometown, where the dominant colors are orange and brown, to the fake world of True Directions, dominated by intense blues and pinks (which are intended to show the artificiality of gender construction). According to Babbit, the germaphobic character of Mary Brown represents AIDS paranoia and her clean, ordered world is filled with plastic flowers, fake sky and PVC outfits. The external shots of the colorful house complete with a <b>bright</b> <b>pink</b> picket fence were filmed in Palmdale, California.|$|E

50|$|The main plumage {{distinction}} from common crossbills is {{the white}} wingbars which give this species its English and scientific names. There are also white tips to the tertials. The adult male is also a somewhat <b>brighter</b> (<b>pinker)</b> red than other male crossbills. Some common crossbills occasionally show weak white wingbars, so care is needed with the correct identification of this species. The chip call is weaker and {{higher than that of}} common crossbill.|$|R
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ramaria botrytis include its large size, the orange, reddish, or purplish branchlets, striate spores with dimensions averaging 13.8 by 4.7µm, and a weak amyloid staining {{reaction of the}} stem tissue. R.rubripermanens has reddish terminal branches, a stout form, and striate spores, but may be distinguished from R.botrytis by its much shorter spores. Other species with which R.botrytis may be confused include: R.formosa, which has branches that are pinker than R.botrytis, and yellow-tipped; R.caulifloriformis, found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, whose branch tips darken with age; R.strasseri, which has yellow to brown branch tips; R.rubrievanescens, which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies; and R.botrytoides, which is most reliably distinguished from R.botrytis by its smooth spores. The European species R.rielii, often confused with R.botrytis and sometimes considered synonymous, can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics: R.reilii lacks the clamped hyphae of R.botrytis, its spores are longer and wider, and they have warts instead of striations. The North American species R.araiospora, though superficially similar to R.botrytis, has several distinguishing characteristics: it grows under hemlock; it has reddish to magenta branches with orange to yellowish tips; it lacks any discernible odor; it has warted, somewhat cylindrical spores averaging 9.9 by 3.7µm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Uniformly colored <b>bright</b> <b>pink</b> to reddish, R.subbotrytis has spores measuring 7–9 by 3–3.5µm.|$|E
5|$|Newborns {{have black}} natal coats and <b>bright</b> <b>pink</b> skin. Females {{are the primary}} {{caregivers}} of infants, but males also play a role. In its first few days, the infant {{may be unable to}} stay attached to its mother and relies on her for physical support. However, its grasp grows stronger by its first week and it is able to cling to its mother's fur by itself. By two weeks, the infant begins to explore its surroundings for short periods, but stays near her. The distance the infant spends away from its mother increases the older it gets. In general, higher-ranking females are usually more relaxed parents than females of lower rank, which usually keep their offspring close to them. However, this difference only lasts for approximately the first eight weeks of an infant's life. Olive baboons do not seem to practice co-operative parenting, but a female may groom an infant that is not hers. Subadult and juvenile females are more likely to care for another's young, as they have not yet produced offspring of their own. One theory for why immature females tend to seek out infants is that they can prepare for their future roles as mothers. Infant baboons born to first-time mothers suffer higher mortality than those born to experienced mothers, which suggests that prior experience in caring for infants is important. Adult males in the groups also care for the infants, as {{they are likely to be}} related to them. Males groom infants, reducing the amount of parasites they may have, and calm them when they are stressed. They may also protect them from predators, such as chimpanzees. However, adult males exploit infants and use them to reduce the likelihood that other males will threaten them.|$|E

25|$|There are 2,867 known {{species of}} plants found in Israel. Of these, at least 253 species are {{introduced}} and non-native. The coastal plain and Sharon regions are especially rich in endemic species.

25|$|A {{much wider}} range of shapes, sizes, and colors is grown in India and {{elsewhere}} in Asia. Larger cultivars weighing up to a kilogram (2.2 pounds) grow in the region between the Ganges and Yamuna Rivers, while smaller ones are found elsewhere. Colors vary from white to yellow or green, as well as reddish-purple and dark purple. Some cultivars have a color gradient—white at the stem, to <b>bright</b> <b>pink,</b> deep purple or even black. Green or purple cultivars with white striping also exist. Chinese cultivars are commonly shaped like a narrower, slightly pendulous cucumber. Also, Asian cultivars of Japanese breeding are grown.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Thomas B Lambert {{was granted}} a patent that {{described}} a process for mass-producing cylinders made from celluloid, an early hard plastic (Henri Lioret of France was producing celluloid cylinders as early as 1893, but they were individually recorded rather than molded). That same year, the Lambert Company of Chicago began selling cylinder records made of the material. They would not break if dropped and could be played thousands of times without wearing out, although {{the choice of the}} <b>bright</b> <b>pink</b> color of early cylinders was arguably a marketing error. The color was changed to black in 1903, but brown and blue cylinders were also produced. The coloring was purportedly done because the dye reduced surface noise. Unlike wax, the hard inflexible material could not be shaved and recorded over, but it had the advantage of being nearly permanent.|$|E
