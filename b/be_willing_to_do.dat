25|$|In 1964, Monte Hellman and Jack Nicholson {{had made}} two films together, Back Door to Hell and Flight to Fury, which were {{produced}} by Roger Corman and filmed back-to-back in the Philippines. After completing the films, {{the director and}} actor wrote a screenplay called Epitaph and presented it to Corman to produce. Corman did not care for the script but asked if the two would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a western for him instead. When they expressed an interest, Corman further suggested that they film two westerns, {{in a manner similar}} to the Philippine-shot movies they had just finished. They agreed and, while Nicholson started working on the script for Ride in the Whirlwind, Hellman asked their mutual friend Carole Eastman to write The Shooting.|$|E
25|$|The Liberals {{returned}} in a hung parliament after the election: their call for {{action against the}} Lords had energised believers in hereditary principle {{to vote for the}} Conservatives, but had failed to generate much interest {{with the rest of the}} voting public. The Liberals formed a minority government with the support of the Labour and Irish nationalist MPs. The Lords subsequently accepted the Budget when the land tax proposal was dropped. However, as a result of the dispute over the Budget, the new government introduced resolutions (that would later form the Parliament Bill) to limit the power of the Lords. The Prime Minister, H. H. Asquith, asked King Edward VII to create sufficient new Liberal peers to pass the Bill if the Lords rejected it. The King said he would not <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so unless Asquith obtained a clear mandate for such sweeping change by winning a second general election.|$|E
500|$|Apart {{from her}} autobiography, Bondfield {{contributed to a}} {{collection}} of essays entitled What Life Has Taught Me, in which 25 public figures pondered on the lessons of life. Bondfield wrote that her religious convictions gave her [...] "strength to meet defeat with a smile, to face success with a sense of responsibility; to <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> one's best without hope of reward [...] to bear misrepresentation without giving way to futile bitterness". In March 1948 Bondfield opened the Mary Macarthur Home at Poulton-le-Fylde, near Blackpool in Lancashire, which provided subsidised holidays for low-paid women workers. In 1949 she made a six-month speaking tour of the United States, her final visit to the country; she left convinced that America would soon adopt a national health service.|$|E

500|$|Like Temple Sinai's {{previous}} rabbis, Broude passionately supported liberal causes, opposing U.S. {{involvement in}} the Vietnam War, and taking part in marches during the Civil Rights Movement. Although he was a Reform rabbi, {{he had gone to}} an Orthodox yeshiva as a boy, and religiously he was in many ways more traditional than his predecessors. He re-introduced ritual into the synagogue, but more contentiously opposed intermarriage. His immediate predecessor, Stern, had officiated at intermarriages [...] "under certain conditions". Broude initially did so as well, under [...] "extenuating circumstances" [...] (e.g. if the bride were pregnant). His position later hardened, and he refused to perform such marriages under any circumstances. He even refused to allow other rabbis who would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so officiate at intermarriages at Temple Sinai. The issue eventually came to a congregational vote in 1972, which supported Broude, although the debate was never completely settled.|$|E
500|$|For {{the role}} of Laila, Zoya wanted someone with an [...] "accent", who would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> scuba diving, and was a half Indian and half Caucasian girl. A lot of girls were auditioned for it in New York and London. Later, in a party, she met Katrina Kaif, and chose her. Her role was {{reportedly}} described as [...] "a free- spirited girl, a wanderer at heart and a bohemian gypsy by nature." [...] Zoya had {{wanted to work with}} Kalki ever since seeing her in Dev D and That Girl in Yellow Boots. She felt that Kalki would fit the bill for the character of Natasha, since she had [...] "the sense of comedy, but not over the top." [...] Ariadna was chosen for {{the role of}} Nuria, since she was liked for her work in the 2009 Spanish film Eloise. The full cast of the film was confirmed by April 2010.|$|E
500|$|Bart's ballet {{teacher was}} voiced by Susan Sarandon, and was {{designed}} {{to look a little}} bit like her. Sarandon had wanted to guest star on the show because her children were big fans; she brought them with her to the recording session. Due to a traffic jam, she was late for the recording session, but once she arrived, she fell into character and worked very hard on getting her accent accurate. Sarandon would later have a cameo appearance as the voice of a computer in the season 17 episode [...] "Bart Has Two Mommies". Mel Brooks has a cameo appearance as himself. His wife Anne Bancroft had {{played a role in the}} episode [...] "Fear of Flying" [...] and Brooks had accompanied her to the recording session. David Mirkin realized that Brooks was [...] "dying to do the show" [...] and asked him if he would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a guest part, and he agreed. Many of the writers were fans of Brooks, and Matt Groening described the chance to have him guest star as [...] "an incredible honor".|$|E

500|$|In April 1973, the Manchester Union Leader accused Chotiner {{of having}} {{organized}} the Watergate break-in. He responded by bringing suit for libel against the Union Leader and its lead investigator. In December 1973, the parties reached a settlement by which Chotiner received an undisclosed, but substantial, {{sum of money}} and the newspaper printed a front-page apology and retraction of its accusations in its December 31, 1973 edition. Chotiner described Watergate in January 1973 as [...] "a stupid, useless, inane experiment {{by people who have}} seen too many TV shows and especially too many productions of [...] ". According to The Washington Post, Chotiner was not close to Haldeman, John Ehrlichman, and most other staffers at the White House and CRP. In a taped discussion of the fallout from Watergate, Haldeman told Nixon that his former campaign manager was not [...] "wired in", and the President expressed strong opposition to Chotiner being used as a White House contact. At the suggestion that Chotiner could defend him, Nixon worried that the attorney might not <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
500|$|The Americans {{started to}} notice and become alarmed at {{increasing}} reports of political disillusionment {{in the military}} officer corps in August. An intelligence report prepared by the US State Department in late August claimed the [...] "worsening of internal security, the promotion of incompetent officers and Diệm's direct interference in army operations ... his political favoritism, inadequate delegation of authority, {{and the influence of}} the Can Lao". It also claimed that discontent with Diệm among high-ranking civil servants was at their highest point since the president had established in power, and that the bureaucrats wanted a change of leadership, through a coup if needed. It was said that Nhu and his wife were the most despised among the civil service. The report predicted that if a coup was to occur, the objective would probably be to force Nhu and his wife out of positions of power and allow Diệm to continue to lead the country with reduced power, should he <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The intelligence analysis turned out to be correct.|$|E
500|$|We {{disliked the}} English {{language}} in the past. I disliked it because I was forced to learn Shakespeare and Milton, for which I had no taste at all. If {{we are going to}} be compelled to learn Hindi, I would perhaps not be able to learn it because of my age, and perhaps I would not <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it because of the amount of constraint you put on me. This kind of intolerance makes us fear that the strong Centre which we need, a strong Centre which is necessary will also mean the enslavement of people who do not speak the language at the centre. I would, Sir, convey a warning on behalf of people of the South for the reason that there are already elements in South India who want separation..., and my honourable friends in U.P. do not help us in any way by flogging their idea of [...] "Hindi Imperialism" [...] to the maximum extent possible.

2500|$|By {{the late}} 1950s, the UNP {{struggled}} {{to deal with}} the rising force of the Sinhala-nationalist Sri Lanka Freedom Party. [...] Jayewardene pushed the party to accommodate nationalism and endorse the Sinhala Only Act, which was bitterly opposed by the island's minorities. [...] Throughout the 1960s Jayewardene clashed over this issue with party leader Dudley Senanayake. Jayewardene saw how skilfully the SLFP had played the ethnic card, and felt the UNP should <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the same, even if it meant losing the support of ethnic minorities.|$|E

[...] He also maintained friendly relations with Zhang, and Cheng Han and Former Liang thereafter maintained a trade relationship. [...] Li Xiong also, with some reluctance, allowed Jin and Former Liang messengers to pass through his territory to communicate with each other.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Honeymooners" [...] {{made its}} debut on October 5, 1951, as a six-minute sketch. Ensemble cast member Art Carney made a brief {{appearance}} {{as a police officer}} who gets hit with flour Ralph had thrown out the window. The tone of these early sketches was much darker than the later series, with Ralph exhibiting extreme bitterness and frustration with his marriage to an equally bitter and argumentative middle-aged woman (Kelton was nine years older than Gleason). The Kramdens' financial struggles mirrored those of Gleason's early life in Brooklyn, and he took great pains to duplicate on set the interior of the apartment where he grew up (right down to his boyhood address of 328 Chauncey Street). The Kramdens—and later the Nortons when those characters are added—are childless, an issue only occasionally explored, but a condition on which Gleason insisted. Ralph and Alice did legally adopt a baby girl whom they named Ralphina (because he actually wanted a baby boy he could name after himself but {{fell in love with the}} baby girl the agency had placed with them). However, the biological mother requested to have her baby returned, and the agency asked whether the Kramdens would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so even though they were the legal parents. Ralph agreed and stated that they would visit her and she would have a real-life Santa Claus every Christmas. A few later skits had ralph mistakenly believe for a while that Alice was pregnant.|$|E
2500|$|Following Nick's eviction, HouseGuests {{competed in}} the [...] "Times Up" [...] {{endurance}} Head of Household competition. For this competition, HouseGuests were required to hang upside down on rocking pendulums; when a player fell off of their pendulum, they were eliminated from the competition. HouseGuests were also eliminated if their torso was raised above a bar located on the pendulum. During the competition, a banner flew over the house which referred to Amber and Eric as being [...] "liars". This banner led Daniele to realize that Eric had voted to evict Kail the previous two weeks, and led to Daniele to begin turning against him. Daniele was the eventual winner of the Head of Household competition. During the competition, Daniele had promised Kail safety for the week in exchange for dropping from the competition. On Day 35, Daniele chose to nominate Jen and Kail for eviction, with the hopes of backdooring Eric that week. When picking players for the Power of Veto competition, Jameka, Dustin, and Zach were selected to play; Amber was selected to host. On Day 36, HouseGuests competed in [...] "The Numbers Don't Lie" [...] Power of Veto competition. For this competition, the HouseGuests had to bid on how many hours they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a task. If a player had the lowest hours, they would be eliminated; putting the highest number resulted in elimination. Jen was {{the winner of the}} Power of Veto. During the competition, Jameka agreed to sit out from the following five Head of Household competition. On Day 38, Jen chose to use the Power of Veto to remove herself from the block, with Eric being nominated in her place. Despite Daniele and Dick believing they had the votes to evict Eric, the remaining five members of the Late Night Crew decided to turn on Daniele and Dick and keep Eric. On Day 41, Kail became the fifth HouseGuest to be evicted from the house in a vote of four to three.|$|E
2500|$|For example, when Edward and Richard {{are urging}} York {{to break his}} oath to Henry, Edward says, [...] "But for a kingdom, any oath may be broken;/I would break a {{thousand}} oaths to reign one year" [...] (1.2.16–17), thus showing the attraction that power has for the characters, and what they would <b>be</b> <b>willing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> to attain it. Later, echoing Warwick's statement about his reasons for joining the Lancastrians, Richard outlines why he has remained loyal to the Yorkists; [...] "I stay not {{for the love of}} Edward but the crown" [...] (4.1.125), again showing the attraction of power and the subversion of all other concerns, including familial relations. Another example is when Prince Edward is killed in Act 5, Scene 5. His death is brought about because he taunts the Plantagenet brothers, and they lose their temper with him, not because they are exacting revenge for an ongoing feud with his family. Similarly, when Richard kills Henry, his motives {{have nothing to do with}} the conflict between his family and Henry's. He murders him simply because Henry stands in the way of his attempts to gain the throne. As Michael Hattaway writes, [...] "family loyalties may have been the initial cause of the feuds, but an audience watching 3 Henry VI is likely to feel that individual ambition rather than family honour is what fuels the vendettas that inform the play. Both [...] seem to have forgotten that the quarrel between [...] originally was a dynastic one: their claims to legitimacy and authority in this play are now validated only by the forces they can muster" [...] As Jane Howell, director of the BBC Shakespeare adaptation argues, [...] "anarchy is loosed and you're left with a very different set of values – every man for himself. You're into a time of change in which there is no code except survival of the fittest – who happens to be Richard." ...|$|E
