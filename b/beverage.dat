5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic <b>Beverage</b> Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic <b>Beverage</b> Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol distribution system whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally Burger King {{has sold}} soft drinks from the Coca-Cola Company in its home market. In 1983, PepsiCo {{garnered}} the $444million <b>beverage</b> supplier contract from its rival, and, {{in the midst}} of extreme market debate over the future of the contract, had it renewed for a second term in 1987. The company won the contract by strengthening the marketing and advertising program ties between Burger King and itself.

5|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected {{to become a}} part of a strong domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century. The Tsar Cannon, which is the world's largest bombard by caliber, is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by Andrey Chokhov and is notable for its rich, decorative relief. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the Italians, resulted in the development of vodka, the national <b>beverage</b> of Russia. As early as 1386 Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy. The Genoese likely developed this <b>beverage</b> with the help of the alchemists of Provence, who used an Arab-invented distillation apparatus to convert grape must into alcohol. A Moscovite monk called Isidore used this technology to produce the first original Russian vodka c. 1430.|$|E
5|$|A similar issue again {{arose in}} 2009 when Burger King {{diverted}} {{several million dollars}} of advertising rebates paid to its American franchises by Coca Cola Corporation and Dr. Pepper Snapple Group to its own coffers. The company intended to utilize these funds to increase its advertising presence in the United States {{at a time when}} corporate advertising costs were falling, which would allow an increased media presence of approximately 25% from the previous year (2008). The NFA contended that Burger King Corporation improperly redirected 40% of restaurant operating funds (ROF) paid by the two <b>beverage</b> suppliers to franchises since 1990 into the corporate advertising budget. These funds were often used by the franchises to pay for <b>beverage</b> support systems such as filtration units and local marketing, and diversion of the funds would cost franchises at least $65 million (USD) between 2010-2012. These funds often helped the franchises' bottom lines, as they were often used to offset other costs imposed on the franchises by Burger King, such as the $1 (USD) Double Cheeseburger.|$|E

40|$|Consumption of {{alcoholic}} <b>beverages</b> is a world-wide phenomenon.

In addition to differences in the amount and type of alcoholic <b>beverages,</b> Italians and Americans differ significantly in the way the alcoholic <b>beverages</b> are consumed, in particular in relation to the consumption of wine in relation to meals. These differences in the consumption of alcoholic <b>beverages</b> between countries can be used to analyze and better understand the health effects of alcoholic <b>beverages</b> on both individuals and populations...|$|R
