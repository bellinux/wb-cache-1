5000|$|Seat belt {{syndrome}} is a collective term that includes all injury profiles {{associated with the}} use of seat belts. It is defined classically as a seat belt sign (seat <b>belt</b> <b>marks</b> on the body) plus an intra-abdominal organ injury (e.g. bowel perforations) and/or thoraco-lumbar vertebral fractures. The seat-belt sign was originally described by Garrett and Braunstein in 1962 as linear ecchymosis of the abdominal wall following a motor vehicle accident. It is indicative of an internal injury in as many as 30% of cases seen in the emergency department. [...] Disruption of the abdominal wall musculature can also occur but is relatively uncommon.|$|E
5000|$|Despite initial {{difficulties}} and tension, such as Willie wetting {{his bed and}} threatening Tom's dog, Sammy, before learning that he belonged to Tom, the two slowly begin to bond, with Willie calling his new guardian 'Mister Tom'. Tom learns that Willie lives with his abusive, mentally ill and extremely religious mother in London after he sees that she has sent a belt for him to use on Willie, {{as well as a}} number of <b>belt</b> <b>marks</b> on Willie's back. Tom does his best to create a suitable home for Willie, such as providing him with new clothes and helping him learn to read and write when his schoolteacher, Mrs. Hartridge, learns that Willie is illiterate. Willie's new life with Tom gradually boosts his self-confidence and he opens up to Tom, looking up to him as a surrogate father figure. He also meets and becomes best friends with a Jewish boy, Zacharias [...] "Zach" [...] Wrench. However, shortly after Willie's tenth birthday, Tom receives a letter from Mrs. Beech, who claims to be ill and needs Willie back in London to look after her.|$|E

40|$|Hundreds of intracontinental rifts with ages between 3. 0 and 0 Ga were {{recognized}} on Earth. Compressional features are either absent or insignificant {{in the vast}} majority of these rifts. Intense compression is the rule in greenstone belts and preservation of regional extensional structures is rare. A common fate of intracontinental rifts is to develop into oceans which are likely to close. Mountain <b>belts</b> <b>mark</b> places where oceans have closed.

40|$|Background: This {{study focused}} on whether there are clear {{indications}} of seat belt use to be found at autopsy, evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of seat <b>belt</b> <b>marks</b> (SBM), and whether use of seat belt and seating location affects the type and severity of injuries sustained. Methods: Information {{on the type of}} injuries sustained and seatbelt use was retrieved from autopsy reports and police reports respectively, for cases of fatal motor vehicle collisions occurring in Sydney, Australia over a 5 year period. Results: A SBM was only found on restrained occupants. The proportion of restrained occupants with evidence of a SBM was 36 % (sensitivity), whilst unrestrained occupants showed no evidence of a SBM (100 % specificity). A SBM was also found to reliably reflect seating position of occupant. Conclusion: Restrained occupants can be expected to show evidence of the seat belt in just over 1 / 3 of cases. A spurious SBM is very unlikely to be present if the occupant was unrestrained...|$|E
40|$|The Central African Cratons {{comprise}} various Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic blocks, flanked or truncated by orogenic belts {{ranging in}} age from Palaeoproterozoic (Rusizian, Ubendian and Usagaran Belts) to Mesoproterozoic (Kibaran and Irumide Belts). These various orogenic systems map out the progressive nucleation of the Central African Cratons to form the Congo Craton, which during late Neoproterozoic times participated in various collisional processes to form part of the Gondwana supercontinent. Subsequently, the opening of the South Atlantic separated a small portion from the Congo Craton, which now forms part of the South American cratonic assemblage and {{is referred to as the}} São Francisco Craton. The original continuity of the São Francisco and Congo Craton is supported by similarities in basement ages and craton stabilisation during Eburnean-aged tectonothermal events and the recognition of the original unity of the Araçuai and West Congo Belts and the Sergipane and Oubanguide Belts across the Atlantic. The nucleation of the Congo Craton from its composing cratonic blocks, which include the Angola-Kasai Block, the NE-Congo-Uganda Block and the Cameroon-Gabon-Congo-São Francisco Block to the west and northwest of the Mesoproterozoic Kibaran Belt, and the Bangweulu Block and Tanzania Craton, to the east and southeast, was at the latest completed after peak compressional tectonism in the Kibaran Belt at 1. 38 Ga.

40|$|International audienceThe Thompson Nickel <b>Belt</b> <b>marks</b> the {{boundary}} between the Archean Superior Province and the Trans-Hudson Orogen in Canada. It comprises Archean gneisses, and Paleoproterozoic rocks with metasediments and metavolcanites (Ospwagan Group) and intrusions. The gneisses are frequently migmatitic and host numerous pegmatites. The western belt boundary is a fault contact with the Kisseynew Domain of the Reindeer Zone. In the south, the transition zone between the belt and the Kisseynew Domain comprises granitoids and a detrital sequence (Grass River Group), part of which grades into turbidites in the Kisseynew Domain. The eastern belt boundary is a diffuse zone where the Archean east­west (E­W) structural trend changes into the north-northeast (NNE) trend of the belt. This paper presents U­Pb ages for granitoids and 207 Pb/ 206 Pb detrital zircon ages from the Ospwagan and Grass River groups. Ages and a comparison of events in the belt and in the eastern Reindeer Zone have major implications. The change from stable platform deposits to syn-tectonic filling and emplacement of mafic intrusions in the Ospwagan Group are attributed to the convergence between the Reindeer Zone and the Superior Province at 1891 ­- 1885 Ma. At ca. 1850 Ma, continuing convergence led to drowning of marginal basins of the Superior craton and {{to the development of a}} transpressive regime in the belt, the onset of which could be as old as ca. 1885 Ma. Metamorphic ages of 1818 ­- 1785 record closure of the Kisseynew basin and crustal thickening. Collision of the new continental block with the Superior Province was accommodated by transpression until 1750 -­ 1720 Ma...|$|E

5000|$|The {{atmosphere}} of Jupiter lacks a clear lower boundary and gradually transitions into the liquid {{interior of the}} planet. From lowest to highest, the atmospheric layers are the troposphere, stratosphere, thermosphere and exosphere. Each layer has characteristic temperature gradients. The lowest layer, the troposphere, has a complicated system of clouds and hazes, comprising layers of ammonia, ammonium hydrosulfide and water. The upper ammonia clouds visible at Jupiter's surface are organized in a dozen zonal bands parallel to the equator and are bounded by powerful zonal atmospheric flows (winds) known as jets. The bands alternate in color: the dark bands are called belts, while light ones are called zones. Zones, which are colder than belts, correspond to upwellings, while <b>belts</b> <b>mark</b> descending air. [...] The zones' lighter color is believed to result from ammonia ice; what gives the belts their darker colors is uncertain.

40|$|The {{southern}} {{coast of the}} Arabian Gulf is considered {{a good example of}} an arid carbonate depositional system. The objective of this field investigation is to better elucidate the dynamic controls on the character and pattern of the depositional belts in a carbonate-evaporite lagoonal setting. The interpretation of this lagoon is based on combined field examination and laboratory analyses of surface samples, and this has resulted in an updated depositional model for carbonate-evaporite lagoonal settings. This study highlights the effects of sediment transport by longshore currents, with the formation of sand spits that gradually closed the lagoon during their southwards migration. The associated narrow and elongated back-barrier settings consist of tidal-dominated muddy sediments affected by a network of tidal channels. This wave-dominated high-energy system has generated several carbonate barrier and back-barrier units that migrated southwards and seawards during the last few thousands of years. This updated depositional model significantly differs from shoreline-parallel facies tracts of the classical Trucial Coast model, where the dominant wind is orientated perpendicular to the coastline. Conversely to the sediment belts of the Trucial Coast, the Al Dakhirah lagoon displays a strongly asymmetrical pattern of the sediment <b>belts,</b> <b>marked</b> by a southwards and seawards migratio...|$|R
