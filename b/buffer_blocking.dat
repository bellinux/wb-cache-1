This is supported by Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT) algorithm to transfer data among two end-to-end paths of an mSCTP association in wireless mobile connectivity. SCTP based CMT technology can transmit data over multiple paths, thus achieving higher data transmission speed. The CMT, however, suffers with receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> problem in wireless mobile networks. A mobile CMT (mCMT) was introduced to further reduce the effect of <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> but still there is a probability of receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> [1]. Receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> {{is caused by the}} loss of data due to various reasons. In this paper, we propose a novel theoretical concept called modified mobile CMT (m 2 CMT) to improve upon the performance of mCMT. It completely avoids receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking.</b> In the proposed new technology of m 2 CMT, three new concepts of Stream Manager, Handoff Manager and Link Status Indicator (LSI) are introduced.

Concurrent Multipath Transfer (CMT), {{which is based on}} SCTP, is devised for multihomed networks. CMT can transmit data over all paths to maximize the data transmission speed. One of the main concerns of CMT is the receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> issue, especially in multihomed wireless mobile networks.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this work is to {{contribute}} to the development of iterative solvers applied to the method of moments solution of electromagnetic wave scattering problems. In recent years there has been much focus on current marching iterative methods, such as Gauss-Seidel and others. These methods attempt to march a solution for the unknown basis function amplitudes in a manner that mimics the physical processes which create the current. In particular the forward backward method has been shown to produce solutions that, for some twodimensional scattering problems, converge more rapidly than non-current marching Krylov methods. The <b>buffered</b> <b>block</b> forward backward method extends these techniques in order to solve three-dimensional scattering problems. The convergence properties of the forward backward and <b>buffered</b> <b>block</b> forward backward methods are analysed extensively in this thesis. In conjunction, several means of accelerating these current marching methods are investigated and implemented. The main contributions of this thesis can be summarised as follows: ² An explicit convergence criterion for the <b>buffered</b> <b>block</b> forward backward method is specified. A rigorous numerical comparison of the convergence rate of the <b>buffered</b> <b>block</b> forward backward method, against that of a range of Krylov solvers, is performed for a range of scattering problems. ² The acceleration of the <b>buffered</b> <b>block</b> forward backward method is investigated using relaxation. ² The efficient application of the <b>buffered</b> <b>block</b> forward backward method to problems involving multiple source locations is examined. ² An optimally sized correction step is introduced designed to accelerate the convergence of current marching methods.

All proposed solutions are implemented in the Linux kernel and evaluated with real network topologies. First, we explore what performance gains can be obtained when a TCP or Multipath TCP (MPTCP) receiver guarantees never to discard received out-of-order PDUs from the receive buffer (i. e., never reneg). TCP is designed to tolerate reneging. This design has been challenged since (i) reneging rarely occurs in practice, and (ii) even when reneging does occur, it alone generally does not help the operating system resume normal operation when the system is starving for memory. In the current MPTCP standard, an MPTCP receiver cannot selectively acknowledge the reception of out-of-order PDUs to an MPTCP sender. We investigate how freeing received out-of-order PDUs from the send buffer by using Non-Renegable Selective Acknowledgments (NR-SACKs) can improve end-to-end performance. This improvement results when send <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> occurs in both TCP and MPTCP. Preliminary results for TCP NR-SACKs show that (i) TCP data transfers with NR-SACKs never perform worse than those without NR-SACKs, and (ii) NR-SACKs can improve end-to-end throughput when send <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> occurs. Under certain circumstances, we observe throughput increasing by using TCP NR-SACKs as much as 15 %. Preliminary results for MPTCP NR-SACKs show that (i) MPTCP data transfers with NR-SACKs never perform worse than those without NR-SACKs, and (ii) NR-SACKs can improve end-to-end throughput in MPTCP when send <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> occurs. Under certain circumstances, we observe throughput increasing by using MPTCP NR-SACKs as much as 38 %. Second, we explore potential application performance gains from two innovative scheduling policies for MPTCP. Whenever an MPTCP sender wants to send data, the scheduler needs to decide on which subflow to send each byte. We explain problems with the default scheduler used by Linux MPTCP, and propose the design of a scheduler based not only on a subflow's speed but also the subflow's congestion. Preliminary results show that our proposed scheduler improves the throughput in MPTCP by alleviating the problems caused by the default scheduler. We also define and use one-way communication delay of a TCP connection to design an MPTCP scheduler that transmits PDUs out-of-order over different subflows such that their arrival is in-order.

40|$|Abstract — A high {{performance}} packet switching archi-tecture called the Pipeback switch is proposed. This archi-tecture ensures lossless packet delivery while maintaining linear buffer complexity. The Pipeback switch improves upon the popular Knockout switch proposed by Y. Yeh et al. Both switches use an N × N space division fabric with output queuing and both designs {{are motivated by}} the observation that the probability of more than L packets arriving in a given timeslot being destined for one partic-ular output port sharply decreases as L is increased. This probability {{is comparable to the}} packet loss probability due to transmission errors for L N. While the arrival of more than L packets destined for a single output in a single timeslot in the Knockout switch results in dropped packets due to <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking,</b> the Pipeback switch avoids such loss by maintaining a separate shared buffer architecture common to all the output ports. This common architecture consists of a novel Pipeback concentration network and a buffer pool. The buffer pool accommodates all the knocked out packets that the Knockout switch would have dropped as a result of <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking,</b> and pipes them back to a separate input line. We further show that the use of buffer pool leads to a {{reduction in the number of}} separate output buffers required at each output port. I...|$|E

This paper studies transport layer protocols with end-to-end fault tolerance through multihoming technologies and their performance improvements. Currently, the research on multihomed transport layer protocols is in the early stages. Most of the algorithms in the protocols are inherited from traditional single-path oriented transmission protocols. This paper analyzes in-depth the effects of retransmission polices and path failure detection mechanisms on the protocol performance and stability in multi-path environments through SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) simulations. The contributions and innovations are as follows. (1) An algorithm for removing spurious failover is proposed to avoid two SCTP stall scenarios found by this paper. In some special path conditions or protocol setting situations, the sender can not obtain precise path delay measurements, which results in spurious transmission timeout, path failover and finally causes the protocol to enter an unstable state. The first stall scenario is triggered when the receiver is using the delayed acknowledgement algorithm. The second scenario occurs when the sender is transmitting packets with different lengths. (2) A mathematic model for estimating receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> is put forward to determine path selection during the fast retransmission phase. This paper illustrates that retransmission on an alternate path will degrade performance significantly when the secondary path bandwidth {{is lower than the}} primary path bandwidth at a certain level because of receiver <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> due to disordered data chunks. (3) The fast recovery algorithm in SCTP is improved for multi-path environments through decoupling the Congestion Control Windows of alternate paths from the primary path Congestion Control Window in the fast recovery phase to prevent the performance degradation caused by disordered SACKs (Selective Acknowledgement). Two data burst control algorithms are evaluated. The test results indicate that burst control by adjusting the Congestion Control Window is better than burst control by limiting the maximum number of transmitted packets. (4) Fast retransmission on an alternate path is studied in the case of multiple paths sharing a congestion point. The results show that fast retransmission on an alternate path will increase congestion of the bottleneck link in this situation. (5) A decision tree for SCTP parameter configuration is proposed. This paper evaluates the performance of fast retransmission policies, timeout retransmission policies and path failure detection thresholds in multi-path contexts. It integrates the above findings and presents the policies for retransmission path selection and path failure detection threshold setting in different path conditions. Finally, this paper emphasizes that the main problem in the current SCTP design is that it employs TCP single-path algorithms in multi-path environments without significant modifications. Therefore, single-path algorithms should be re-evaluated before being applied to multi-path environments...|$|E

40|$|Going beyond {{wavelength}} switching, {{researchers have}} proposed several packet-based optical switching schemes. These schemes allow the bandwidth {{of an individual}} wavelength channel to be further sub-divided in a dynamic way, as optical network users may not always require the full capacity of a wavelength channel. These packet-based optical switching schemes include Optical Burst Switching (OBS) and Optical Packet Switching (OPS). One of {{the challenges of the}} OBS and OPS schemes is the implementation of the optical buffer. The only optical technology that appears feasible for providing optical buffer in the near future is Fiber Delay Line (FDL). Compared with Random Access Memory (RAM) electronic buffer, FDL is basically a first-in-first-out fixed delay line. Implementation of optical buffer by FDL is complicated and relatively expensive. We believe that optical buffering must be used sparingly and effectively in optical networks. The second challenge of the OBS and OPS schemes is the complexity in header processing. We introduce the concept of Photonic Circuit Switching (PCS) as a method for sub-division of the capacity of a wavelength channel in optical networks. The advantage of PCS is that header processing is not required, and that with proper designs, optical buffer requirement can also be minimized. PCS is completely analogous to TDM circuit switching, except that it operates in the optical domain while the latter operates in the electronic domain. Hence, in PCS, signal transmission on a link is partitioned into fix-sized time-slots and these time slots are organized into repetitive frames of a fixed number of slots. The focus in this thesis is to consider ways to route and select time slots for photonic circuits so that buffering requirement in the network can be minimized. We refer to this as the Time-slot Assignment (RTA) problem. Some heuristic algorithms for RTA are investigated, and comparisons are made between coupled schemes and uncoupled schemes - in the former routing and time-slot assignment are solved together as one problem, and in the latter the routing problem is solved first. A shortest path algorithm is devised such that by expanding the network into a set of virtual nodes, we can flexibly solve the RTA problem under various bandwidth/buffer cost. In our quantitative results, measurements of bandwidth blocking and <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> probabilities are presented which should serve as an important guidance to designers of PCS networks...|$|E

It {{is based on the}} conventional slow-freezing method with 10 % DMSO and modified mainly in a thawing protocol without specific equipment or reagents. Recovery rate of the cells cryopreserved by this method was equally high, which is comparable to that of the cells frozen by the vitrification method. In the case of vitrification method, it requires practiced hand because cells can be terribly damaged upon failure of rapid-warming process and strict maintenance of low temperature is required throughout the cryopreservation. On the contrary, our method is available for novices and cryopreserved cells can maintain cell recovery rate for one week after transfer from - 150 °C to - 80 °C condition. This simple modified method would gain widespread acceptance. ### Introduction Human embryonic stem (hES) cells 1 and human induced pluripotent (hiPS) cells 2, 3 have great potential as a possible source of cells for the regenerative medical transplantation of various tissues and also for other research applications, such as developmental biology, toxicology, and drug discovery. Today, a number of hES and hiPS cell lines have been established around the world. To promote these great potential researches using hES and hiPS cell lines, the prerequisite is the foundation of cell banks of well-characterized and safety-tested cells for research which serve as seed stocks for therapeutic applications. Currently, several cell banks are distributing such cell lines all over the world. The International Stem Cell Banking Initiative has developed a consensus on the principles of best practice for the banking, testing, and distribution of hES cells 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. During cell banking, although most of the procedures share many of the principles of routine cell culture, a number of significant steps exist in the case of hES and hiPS cells. One of them is cryopreservation 9. Both hES and hiPS cells have been well-known {{to be sensitive to the}} cryopreservation 9, 10, 11. Two cryopreservation methods are commonly used for hES and hiPS cells which are vitrification 12, 13, 14, 15 and slow freezing 16, 17, 18, 19. At this moment, vitrification method is considered to be preferable for the local storage because of the high survival rate 12, 15, 16, 20. However, vitrified cells can be terribly damaged upon failure of rapid-warming process without practiced hand compared to slow-frozen cells. Furthermore, if the low temperature is not strictly maintained, cell viability decreases rapidly. Therefore, when vitrified cells are transported, it needs liquid nitrogen dry-shippers with careful documentation for the regulatory requirements and transports companies with technical expertise to undertake such shipments, resulting in the high costs involved. As for slow-freezing method with dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), although it has been long trusted as a stable cryopreservation for a wide variety of cells including mouse ES cells, it produces low levels of recovery or spontaneously differentiation for hES and hiPS cells. Until now, several approaches have been investigated for the improvement of cryopreservation for hES and hiPS cells such as the technique based on stabilizing hES colonies adherent to or embedded in a Matrigel matrix 17, and the protocol using of Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) inhibitor 21, 22. Considering clinical application of hES and hiPS cells, xeno-free defined freezing medium should be required. An effective serum- and xeno-free chemically defined freezing procedure was reported by Hovatta’s group 23. Another group has proposed in situ cryopreservation using gas permeable culture casettes 24. However, there is not any evidence that the cells can stably preserve their phenotypes for more than 10 years, excluding the conventional cryopreservation of the cells with DMSO. Thus, it is suggested that although these new methods would be worth to be challenged, the conventional cryopreservation should be backed up as a precaution. We here show that a simple modification of the conventional slow freezing cryopreservation with 10 % DMSO increased cell viability after thawing. This method requires neither specific equipment nor reagents and only the thawing way is changed, but resulting cells have comparable growth ability to those of vitrified cells. Even when using defined medium, such as our growth factor defined medium hESF 925, 26, 27, 28, or Thomson’s mTeSR medium 29, this method could work well. Because the conventional slow freezing cryopreservation is quite familiar, this simple method would gain widespread acceptance. ### Materials Critical: All reagents and materials used must be sterile. 1.

Passage colonies every 5 - 7 days depending on colony growth. Exchange culture medium every day except the day following the passaging. Freeze stock of hES/iPS Cells: 1. Remove the differentiated area completely by using the Pasteur pipette in advance. - Examine all the plates containing hES/iPS Cells by inverted phase-contrast microscopy. Cultures used for cryopreservation should show no signs of microbial contamination and should be subconfluent (the distance between the colonies is < 10 - 20 % of the average colony diameter). Confluent cultures may be less amenable to freezing. - Label cryogenic vials with the name of the cell line, passage number, lot number and the date. - Remove the culture medium from flasks. - Add 1. 5 ml dispase (1 U/ml) per the T 25 flask and incubate for 2 - 5 min until the edges of the colonies start to curl. - CRITICAL: Treatment time of dispase varies and depends on the cell lines and quality of colonies used. 6. Gently scrape with scraper and pipetting with 10 ml pipette so as not to be small clumps. - CRITICAL: Cell colonies should not be disrupted in small size. - Transfer to a 15 ml centrifuge tube and spin at 20 X g, 2 min, 4 °C. - CRITICAL: It is recommended to centrifuge at low g forces (20 x g) to prevent feeder cells collecting at the bottom of the tube together. - Carefully aspirate supernatant without disturbing the cell pellet. CRITICAL: Finger tap the tube gently to disperse the pellet. - Resuspend the cells in freshly prepared ice-cold freezing medium (10 % DMSO/culture medium). CRITICAL: The freezing medium should be prepared freshly and kept on ice before use. - Transfer 200 µl aliquots into each labeled cryogenic vial. - CRITICAL: Small volume may result in higher cell survival rates. It is recommended the volume of fluid during cryopreservation is 200 ul rather than 500 ul. - Place the vials on ice for a few minute. - CRITICAL: Vials are allowed to sit on ice for 15 min. A prolonged storage on ice is likely to cause a further decline of cell viability. - Store them in the freezing container (BICELL or Mr. Frosty®) and keep it in a - 80 °C deep freezer overnight. - CRITICAL: It is recommended to finish suspension within 30 min. Prolonged immersion cause decline in cell viability. - Next day transfer the vials to the liquid nitrogen tank (in the vapor phase, - 150 °C). - CRITICAL: Immersion of vials into the liquid phase of liquid nitrogen may lead to viral or cross contamination. - CRITICAL: It is recommended to abort long term storage in a - 80 °C deep freezer. An extended storage at - 80 °C causes the decline in cell recovery. Storage in a - 80 °C deep freezer within 7 days after transferring from liquid nitrogen tank is permissible. - CRITICAL: It is reported that vitrification protocols may be superior to slow freezing. We showed our slow freezing method was equally successful as vitrification method. - PAUSE POINT: The cells can be stored indefinitely in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen. - Document the details of vials and storage location in the appropriate inventory. - Preparation of feeder seeded culture flasks before thawing of hES/hiPS cells - Coat the flasks with 0. 1 % gelatin (3 ml/ 25 cm 2 flask). - Incubate the flasks for 1 hour at 37 °C or overnight at room temperature. - Rinse the flasks with PBS. - Inoculate mitomycin c-treated primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts (PMEF) at 5 - 7 × 10 e 3 cells/cm 2 in DMEM (high glucose) containing 10 % heat inactivated FBS. - CRITICAL: Prepare the feeder seeded culture flasks in a few days in advance of the thawing or passaging of hES/hiPS cells, and use them within 5 days. - CRITICAL: Density of feeder cells should be determined by colony morphology of hES/hiPS cells in advance. - Thawing of hES/hiPs cells - Prior to using of feeder seeded flasks, replace the medium with the human pluripotent cell medium twice. - Pre-warm 10 ml of the human pluripotent cell medium in a 15 ml tube in a 37 °C water bath. - Rapidly thaw out frozen cells by adding the pre-warmed medium directly into a vial with the transfer pipette. CRITICAL: In a case of thawing the frozen cells in a 37 °C water bath or in a 37 °C incubator, the cells may be seriously damaged. - Gently collect the cells in the 15 ml tube and wash vial with the pre-warmed medium. - Centrifuge the tube at 90 x g, 2 min, room temperature. - Aspirate the medium and finger tap the tube gently to disperse the pellet. - Resuspend the cells in 5 - 7 ml of pre-warmed culture medium and transfer the suspension into a 25 cm 2 flask. - Gently move the flask several times along horizontal and vertical directions to distribute the cells evenly. - Incubate the flasks in an incubator at 37 °C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2. - Culture medium should be exchanged every other day until hES/hiPS cells are ready for passaging. - CRITICAL: Do not move the flask on the day following the passaging. - Alkaline phosphatase staining to determine the growth of hiPS/hES cells - Remove the culture medium and rinse once with PBS for 1 min at room temperature. - Fix the colonies with the fixation buffer for 1 min at room temperature. - Wash twice with DDW. - Start the color reaction by incubating in the reaction <b>buffer</b> <b>blocking</b> off the light. - Stop the reaction after 15 min by washing twice with DDW. - Count the stained colonies. ### Timing - Steps 1 – 14, Freeze stock of hES/iPS: 1 hour - Steps 15 – 18, Preparation of feeder seeded culture flasks before thawing of hES/hiPS cells: 5 - 10 days - Steps 19 – 29, Thawing of hES/hiPS: 10 – 15 minutes - Steps 30 – 35, Alkaline phosphatase staining: 20 – 30 minutes ### Anticipated Results Simple modified method of conventional slow freezing cryopreservation for hES and hiPS cells described here have equally successful recovery rate and ability to maintain undifferentiated state as those of vitrification method (Fig. 1, Fig. 2). Thawing method by addition of pre-warmed medium directly into the frozen vial also leads to high cell viability after recovery from cryopreservation (Fig. 3). Additionally, shortening keeping time on ice before freezing (Suppl. Fig. 1), use of dispase (Suppl. Fig. 2), shortening cell suspension time after the dissociation process (Suppl. Fig. 3), reducing fluid volume from 500 to 200 ul (Suppl. Fig. 4), implementation of freezing process in vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (- 150 °C) within 7 days after slow freezing process in a - 80 °C deep freezer (Suppl. Fig. 5) increase viability of the cryopreserved cells by the slow freezing method. Moreover, cryopreserved cells are maintained high recovery rate and undifferentiated state within 7 days if the vials were transferred from a liquid nitrogen gas tank to a - 80 deep freezer (Suppl. Fig. 6). Our method may be available for novices, because it is simple and easy method that requires neither specific equipment nor reagents (Fig. 1). Moreover, our method allows for keeping in a - 80 °C deep freezer within one week after transferring from a liquid nitrogen tank, which make favorable to transportation as compared to vitrification method. Also, this cryopreservation is available for serum-free culture such as culture with hESF 9 medium and hESF 9 a 2 i medium 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. We believe that our method can be employed by stem cell banking and researchers and will most likely lead to the expected outcome. ### References 1. Thomson, J. A. et al.
