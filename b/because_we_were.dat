Silicone doesn’t have cell structure, like foam does. It doesn’t breathe. So Brian was basically encased in a sixty-pound wet-suit. Every part of his body was covered. He had facial prosthetics, hands, full legs, feet. It was all glued down. It wasn’t like we could take him out between takes. He was in.|$|E
5|$|It's {{strange to}} hear Uncle Tupelo {{mentioned}} {{because what we}} were doing was in such a long line of musical history. People are wrong in starting with us and saying we started anything <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> just picking up the ball, starting with Woody Guthrie and on to the early '60s and the Flying Burrito Brothers that we were influenced by. We didn't start a genre. We contributed to a long line of fairly good music. That's the way we looked at it at the time—doing what was right for the song.|$|E
5|$|November 27, 1888: Petition {{from the}} King of Rurutu and the Queen of Rimatara and their nobles to Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen Victoria, {{and to the}} Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. May you have good health. We, Teuruarii, King of Rurutu and Te Maere, Queen of Rimatara and our nobles, ask for the Prime Minister to place our islands and our ships under the {{protection}} of the British flag. These are the islands, namely, Rurutu, Rimatara, and Marià, and there are the names of the ships: Faaito and Ronui, and the masters of the same are natives. This is our word to you: Do not forsake us; we are your children; you taught us the word of God, and that has led us in the path of civilisation; therefore we know that you are a good parent to us. The thoughts of the children cling fondly to their good parent; they do not wish to be separated from their good parent. If the parent forsake the children, the children will seek the parent; so do we; we are like those children, and we ask that you will give us your flag to protect us. We have heard that you have taken Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands under your protection, but we remain without anyone to protect us. When we received the news that Rarotonga and the neighbouring islands were placed under your protection, we wept aloud <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> forsaken by you; we were afraid lest we should be adopted by another parent. The strange parent we mean is the French. They did not feed us with the milk of the gospel, but you did. O Great Britain; you fed us with that milk which has given life to us. This is our last word to you; we do not wish for French annexation or protection, not at all, but we wish you to be our parent, O Great Britain. We pray you now to accede to this our request. This letter was written in the house of Queen Pa. -TEURUARII, TE MAERE ARII.|$|E

No. Then why <b>are</b> <b>we</b> here, my friends? Air we in possession of a sinful secret, and do we require corn, and wine, and oil, or what is much the same thing, money, for the keeping thereof? Probably so, my friends." ...|$|R

25|$|GIULIANI: That's {{really an}} {{extraordinary}} statement. That's an extraordinary statement, {{as someone who}} lived through the attack of September 11, that we invited the attack <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> attacking Iraq. I don't think I've heard that before, and I've heard some pretty absurd explanations for September 11th.

It's going to become more and more difficult, and it's going to create more and more disillusioned people who become dishonest and angry and are willing to fuck the next guy to get what they want. There's so much stepping on the backs of other people in our profession. We've been so lucky that we've never had to do that.

For us it was not a question of the professional honor of a soldier, it was the question of an idea, an aim that had to be achieved. We were aiming at a political goal. There are many examples of what we did to be found in the Bible – Gideon and Samson, for instance. This had an influence on our thinking. And we also learned from the history of other peoples who fought for their freedom – the Russian and Irish revolutionaries, Giuseppe Garibaldi and Josip Broz Tito.|$|E

500|$|On January 28, Davis {{postponed}} his Knicks debut due to {{an elbow}} infection and more back pain. Then New York considered releasing Lin before his contract became guaranteed on February 10 so they could sign a new player. However, after the Knicks squandered a fourth quarter lead in a February 3 loss to the Boston Celtics, coach Mike D'Antoni decided to give Lin a chance to play, in [...] "desperation" [...] according to experts. [...] "He got lucky <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> playing so bad," [...] said D'Antoni. Lin had played only 55minutes through the Knicks' first 23games, but he unexpectedly led a turnaround of an 8–15 team that had lost 11 of its last 13 games.|$|E

I don't feel that the characters ever {{knew what was going on}} and I don't think it is all that cool that kids are murdering people.

According to Bowie, [...] "I got some quite extraordinary things out of Earl Slick. I think it captured his imagination to make noises on guitar, and textures, rather than playing the right notes." [...] Alomar recalled, [...] "It {{was one of the most}} glorious albums that I've ever done... We experimented so much on it". Maslin added, [...] "I loved those sessions <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> totally open and experimental in our approach".|$|E
500|$|Over {{the course}} of the {{recording}} sessions, the band worked on what Bono estimated to be 50 songs; the Edge said they had about 25 songs to choose from, five of which were still very much in a rough state. Bono said that the songwriting process was humbling, as some songs, [...] "you could get them halfway up the hill, three-quarters of the way up the hill. A lot of times, we just couldn't get them {{up to the top of}} the hill." [...] Speaking about the record's long gestation period, Bono said, [...] "Rumour has it we haven't made a U2 album in the last five years. We have. We've made several. We just didn't release them <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> waiting for something that would be as good as the best we've ever done." ...|$|E

Of course, we hadn't a clue who Jean-Paul Sartre was. We got inspired by all the French artists and writers, because that was the closest we could get.
