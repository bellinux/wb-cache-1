As Brian Taves describes, [...] "Many of the poorest theaters, such as the 'grind houses' in the larger cities, screened a continuous program emphasizing action with no specific schedule, sometimes offering six quickies for a nickel in an all-night show that changed daily." [...] Many small theaters never saw a big-studio A film, getting their movies from the states rights concerns that handled almost exclusively Poverty Row product. Millions of Americans went to their local theaters as a matter of course: for an A picture, along with the trailers, or screen previews, that presaged its arrival, [...] "he new film's title on the marquee and the listings for it in the local newspaper constituted all the advertising most movies got", writes Epstein.

2500|$|In {{the model}} that would be {{standard}} during the Golden Age, the industry's top product, its A films, would premiere at a select number of deluxe first-run metropolitan cinemas, located in U.S. cities with populations {{in the range of}} 100,000 and above. There were fewer than 500 of these downtown movie palaces; in 1934, 77 percent of them were under the control of {{one or the other of}} the leading studios, the [...] "Big Five." [...] As a whole, the first-run circuit comprised the palaces and another 900 or so houses covering North America's 400 largest municipalities. Double features, though sometimes employed, were the rule at few if any of these prestigious venues. As described by historian Edward Jay Epstein, [...] "During the first runs, films got their reviews, garnered publicity, and generated the word of mouth that served as the principal form of advertising." [...] After a film's opening run, it was off to the nabes and the hinterland, the subsequent-run market where the double feature prevailed. At the larger local venues controlled by the majors, movies might turn over on a weekly basis. At the thousands of small theaters that belonged to independent chains or were individually owned, programs often changed two or three time a week, sometimes even faster.

2500|$|At the studio's {{annual sales}} meeting in June 1937, Briskin {{announced}} that Marcus' {{position within the}} organization would remain unchanged for the upcoming 1937-38 season. Marcus was responsible for overseeing {{about half of the}} overall production for RKO. Briskin, rather than giving Marcus a budgeted amount for each picture, simply gave Marcus an overall lump sum with which he was responsible for completing all his filming assignments. This was an effort {{to do away with the}} practice of grading pictures as either [...] "A" [...] or [...] "B" [...] films. When Briskin departed RKO in the Fall of 1937, Marcus retained his position, although there was some discussion of him replacing Berman. His name was on a short list, along with David O. Selznick, Mervyn LeRoy, Ben Kahane, and Jesse L. Lasky. When that didn't materialize, by the beginning of 1938 there was talk that he would split the head production activities of the studio with Pandro S. Berman, with Marcus in charge of B-films and Berman in charge of A-films. By the end of February 1938 that arrangement was made official by Leo Spitz, the new president of RKO, and in August Marcus was given a new three-year contract with the studio. In 1938 RKO created a new type of motion picture, the exploitation film, in response to potential issues from the Hays commission and the National Legion of Decency about the number of crime dramas which were being produced by the studios. One of the first was Smashing the Rackets (1938), after which Marcus suggested two other exploitation films, Clip Joint and Strip Tease. Neither had either social significance or artistic value, but were conceived solely to drive viewers through the turnstiles. While they perfectly fit the bill of what Spitz was looking for, he passed on making either film. When Berman was replaced by Harry Eddington in December 1939 as the head of A-film production, Marcus remained in charge of RKO's <b>B</b> <b>product.</b> In 1940, Marcus produced what many consider the first film noir, Stranger on the Third Floor. Marcus remained in charge of the low-budget films at RKO until February 19, 1941, when studio head George J. Schaefer assumed total control of production, demoting both Eddington and Marcus. Marcus was relegated to being simply a studio producer. Marcus lasted three months in his new position, resigning from RKO at the end of April, 1941.|$|E

5000|$|Under Clear Channel {{the station}} changed only {{slightly}} initially. In 2002 the station began to lean younger and play more Rap and R & <b>B</b> <b>product.</b> At {{that point the}} airstaff gradually changed and the station gradually began automating more timeslots during the day.

In January 2003, they began simulcasting Z100's Elvis Duran and the Morning Zoo and made a few more airstaff changes. Until the summer of 2004 Max 106.3 was playing {{a large amount of}} rap along with a lot of alternative rock and R & B material. One of the large contributors to the alternative rock portion of the programming during 2003 was the Channel X program, originally created and hosted by [...] "Borasio", a host named [...] "Uncle Kenny" [...] (Hoyt-singer for a local metal band named Crushpile with no known former radio experience) was recruited. This name, however, was used only once and [...] "Kenny" [...] was the on-air name to be used during the short-lived period of the program (January 2003-September 2003). The original time slot for the program was 10pm to midnight. Due to high demand, the program was extended to 9pm. Within the 9 months of the program's existence, it peaked at an astounding 37 percent market share (Arbitron 2003). Many attribute the show's success to a combination of Kenny's antics and the musical mix (which ranged from modern day rock such as Linkin Park to old thrash bands like Anthrax and Slayer). Kenny's approach was far different from the cardboard cut-out standard of today's commercial radio. The entire 3-hour show was done live with no preparation, additional writers or hosts. Although fictitious [...] "record label executives" [...] had been known to drop by the station for [...] "exclusive interviews". Bizarre on-air comments, stories, blank-outs, spasms, sound effects and more were not uncommon for the program. Despite the success of this program and others, since 2002 advertising was becoming a tough sell because the format leaned too young.|$|E

5000|$|WHOM and WHOM-FM, in {{the early}} 1970s, were sold to SJR Communications. On June 5, 1975, WHOM-FM became WKTU, taking on an Adult Contemporary format and was {{positioned}} as [...] "soft rock". They were known as [...] "Mellow 92". They played current AC songs that crossed over to Top 40 {{as well as a}} mix of music from 1964 forward. Core artists included Eagles, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, James Taylor, Paul Simon, Stylistics, Linda Ronstadt, Four Tops, Carly Simon, Barry Manilow, and some more contemporary cuts by Barbra Streisand. For 1960s music the station played softer Beatles songs, Mamas and Papas, Spanky and Our Gang, Association, Fifth Dimension, among others. The station steered clear of AC only songs and standards vocalists as well as hard rock or uptempo R & B. Eventually the station evolved, re-positioned as mellow rock, dropped artists like the Carpenters, most R & <b>B</b> <b>product,</b> and added some softer songs from AOR artists. Unlike today's Adult contemporary music formats, WKTU, by early 1978, was only playing artists heard on Album-oriented rock stations, using the softer songs from their popular albums. Artists found primarily on Top 40 stations were no longer included.) WKTU was still called [...] "Mellow 92" [...] at that point. Ratings were relatively low. The Mellow 92 continued until June 1978. Meanwhile, station executive, David Rapaport (father of actor Michael Rapaport), visited New York's Studio 54 discothèque on half a dozen occasions, and was very impressed with the crowds there. He got the idea that a disco-based station was needed, as several FM-based Top 40 stations were leaning disco in other markets, although no one was airing all disco music around the clock. As a result, Rapaport purchased 200 disco records and brought them into the station. WKTU abruptly flipped to a disco-based rhythmic top 40 format with the tagline [...] "Disco 92" [...] at 6 p.m. on July 24, 1978. The same disc jockeys from the mellow format were at first kept on, with Paco from Spanish language sister station 1480 WJIT added for afternoons. That fall, the station rose from [...] "Worst to First", unseating long-time leader 770 WABC in the 18−30 age demographic. Air personalities of this era included Kenn Hayes, Randy Place, Paul Robinson, Trip Reeb, Mary Thomas, Dave Mallow and Joe Guarisco. During the height of the disco craze, WKTU was the station to follow in New York.|$|E
