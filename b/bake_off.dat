25|$|On 25 January 2017, Berry won {{the award}} for Best TV Judge at the National Television Awards for Great British <b>Bake</b> <b>Off.</b>|$|E
25|$|From 2010 to 2016 {{she was one}} of {{the judges}} on BBC One's The Great British <b>Bake</b> <b>Off</b> {{alongside}} baker Paul Hollywood, who specialises in bread. Berry says that since working together, she has learned from him. However, some viewers were outraged during the first series when a decision was made to make the contestants use one of Hollywood's recipes for scones instead of one of Berry's. Her work on the show with Hollywood has led to The Guardian suggesting that it is the best reality TV judging partnership ever. In September 2016, Love Productions announced that a three-year deal to broadcast the show on Channel 4 instead of the BBC from 2017 had been agreed. Co-hosts Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins announced that they would not be continuing with <b>Bake</b> <b>Off</b> on its new network. Berry announced she was also leaving <b>Bake</b> <b>Off</b> on the same day that fellow judge Paul Hollywood announced he would be staying with the show.|$|E

25|$|Much of BBC Two's output has {{previously}} or subsequently been shown on other channels. Some of these programmes are repeats of popular or flagship programmes from BBC Four in {{a late night}} strand, originally called BBC Four on Two but now unbranded, {{for the benefit of}} audiences without access to BBC Four. Other programmes are moved to the channel {{as a result of their}} success on BBC Three or Four, so that subsequent series are well received. An example of this is the BBC Three series Torchwood that was transferred to the channel following the success of the first series. BBC Two is also used as a testing ground for programmes prior to their moving to the flagship BBC One: such examples include Have I Got News for You and popular comedies Absolutely Fabulous and Miranda, which moved to BBC One after success on Two. Also in August 2014 The Great British <b>Bake</b> <b>Off</b> moved to BBC One due to its success the previous year on BBC Two.|$|E
60|$|There {{was just}} {{time to show}} the glass cupboard, and the shelf where Toby had stood, and {{to return to the}} dining-room, before the {{children}} began to stream in and make their greetings to their uncle, Susan with George in one hand, and her plate of bakings in the other. Very fancy bread indeed it was! as Uncle John said. The edge of Purday's hat had been quite <b>baked</b> <b>off,</b> and one of his arms was gone; he was black in the wrong places, and was altogether rather an uncomfortable-looking object. David's brood of rabbits were much more successful, though the ears of many had fallen off. Uncle John was very much diverted, and took his full share of admiring and tasting the various performances. On the whole, the meal went off much better than Christabel had feared it would. She had really broken the children of many of the habits with which they used to make themselves disagreeable; there was no putting of spoons into each other's cups, nor reaching out with buttery fingers; lips were wiped, and people sat still upon their chairs, even if they fidgeted and sighed; and there was only one slop made all tea-time, and that was by Johnnie, and not a very bad one. Indeed, it might be hoped that Mr. Merrifield did not see it, for he was talking to Sam about the change of footpath that Mr. Greville was making. There was indeed no fun, but it might be doubted whether Papa would have been in a mood for fun even had his brother not been there; and Miss Fosbrook was rather glad there was nothing to make the children forgetful of propriety.|$|R
50|$|There, a herder-boy {{would have}} broken it open, {{but she got}} him to get his father instead. She stayed with his father for a time, and went into service at the king's house, in the kitchen. She refused {{to go to the}} sermon because she had bread to <b>bake,</b> and sneaked <b>off</b> to go dressed in the swan-down dress and the king's son fell in love with her. She went again, in the moorland canach dress, and then in that of gold and silver, with the shoes, but the third time, the king's son had set a guard, and she escaped, but leaving a shoe behind.|$|R
