40|$|Port wine stains (PWS) are {{congenital}} capillary malformations {{consisting of}} ectasia of capillaries and venules. At birth, lesions are flat and relatively uniform in color, but evolve with age to become raised, thickened, irregularly surfaced, and deeply colored. Therefore, {{it is considered}} optimal to begin treatment of patients at an early age. Conventional treatment modalities, such as electrocautery or excision, require considerable effort and may be cosmetically unsatisfactory. We have performed treatment of <b>blebbed</b> PWS of four patients using a 1, 064 nm long pulsed Nd:YAG laser with a contact cooling device. According to their size, most blebs required three or fewer treatment sessions at 8 -week intervals.

30|$|To {{determine}} {{the frequency of}} micronuclei (MN) and other nuclear abnormalities, two smears were done per fish. These smears were stained with Wright-Methanol (Merck®) previously filtered during 10  min. In each smear, 2000 cells with intact nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes were counted (Al-Sabti and Metcalfe 1995). The criteria to determine MN were: MN diameter smaller than 1 / 3 of the principal nuclei, clearly separated to the nuclei, nonrefractory, with the same colour and intensity and included in the cytoplasm (Grisolia 2002). The nuclear abnormalities were classified according to Carrasco et al. (1990). A <b>blebbed</b> nucleus {{was identified as a}} small invagination of the nuclear membrane. Invaginations bigger than the <b>blebbed</b> nuclei with various lobules were classified as lobed nuclei and erythrocytes with a noticeable depression into the nucleus without nuclear material were classified as notched nuclei. Cells with two separated nuclei with similar size were distinguished as binuclear cells. The frequency of micronuclei and other nuclear abnormalities were determined per each fish and expressed in a 1000 cell count (%).|$|R
2500|$|There is an {{upregulation}} of this SUR1/ TRPM4 nonselective cation channel {{followed by}} brain tumor, ischemic injury, and traumatic brain injury. This channel which is activated by ATP depletion is found on neurons, neuroglia and endothelium. This channel enables the passive {{transport of water}} and solute and represents the [...] ATP independent stage of cerebral formation. Opening of these channels result in cellular depolarization and <b>blebbing</b> causing cytotoxic edema. This can be prevented by using glyburide (glibenclamide) which inhibits these channels.|$|E
2500|$|Apoptosis (from Ancient Greek ἀπόπτωσις [...] "falling off") is {{a process}} of {{programmed}} cell death that occurs in multicellular organisms. Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include <b>blebbing,</b> cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, chromosomal DNA fragmentation, and global mRNA decay. Between 50 and 70 billion cells die each day due to apoptosis in the average human adult. For an average child between the ages of 8 and 14, approximately 20 to 30 billion cells die a day.|$|E
2500|$|Apoptosis is {{the process}} of {{programmed}} cell death (PCD) that may occur in multicellular organisms. Biochemical events lead to characteristic cell changes (morphology) and death. These changes include <b>blebbing,</b> cell shrinkage, nuclear fragmentation, chromatin condensation, and chromosomal DNA fragmentation. It is now thought that- in a developmental context- cells are induced to positively commit suicide whilst in a homeostatic context; the absence of certain survival factors may provide the impetus for suicide. There appears to be some variation in the morphology and indeed the biochemistry of these suicide pathways; some treading the path of [...] "apoptosis", others following a more generalized pathway to deletion, but both usually being genetically and synthetically motivated. There is some evidence that certain symptoms of [...] "apoptosis" [...] such as endonuclease activation can be spuriously induced without engaging a genetic cascade, however, presumably true apoptosis and programmed cell death must be genetically mediated. It is also becoming clear that mitosis and apoptosis are toggled or linked in some way and that the balance achieved depends on signals received from appropriate growth or survival factors.|$|E
40|$|The strong {{negative}} {{anthropogenic pressure}} on the River Bregalnica resulted in the increase of pollution in the river ecosystem. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate if aquatic pollutants generate genotoxic effects in barbel (Barbus peloponnesius). Thirty individuals were collected from three localities along the river: one control site and two locations in the middle and lower course of the river with the presence of different pollution sources. Blood smears were stained with May Grünwald/Giemsa method and the frequency of micronuclei, vacuolated nuclei, binuclei, <b>blebbed</b> nuclei and notched nuclei expressed in per mill was recorded. In fish collected from the control site, the investigated erythrocyte nuclear abnormalities revealed lowest values compared to polluted sites. In general, significantly higher values for erythrocyte deformations, including micronuclei, were noted in the middle and lower part of the river. Significantly higher values of vacuolated and <b>blebbed</b> nuclei were detected in fish from the middle course of the river, while at the lower course the frequencies of occurrence of micronuclei and notched nuclei were significant compared with control site. The middle course of the River Bregalnica has more diverse pollutants compared to the lower course, and consequently the highest frequency of all nuclear deformations was found in barbel from the middle course of the river. Obtained results suggest that pollutants draining into the Bregalnica river ecosystem display a genotoxic effect on the local barbel population...|$|R

This swelling is reversible but the cristae do not completely re-form and have a <b>blebbed</b> appearance. On repeated swelling and contraction cycles there is a gradual loss of matrix material. Calcium chloride and Pi produce a slow swelling of the matrix space. Shrinkage induced by ATP was partial and not associated with return to the original structure...|$|R
40|$|Cholesterol {{distribution}} and dynamics in the plasma membrane (PM) are poorly understood. The recent development of Bodipy 488 -conjugated cholesterol molecule (Bdp-Chol) {{allowed us to}} study cholesterol behav-ior in the PM, using single fluorescent-molecule imaging. Surprisingly, in the intact PM, Bdp-Chol diffused at the fastest rate ever found for any molecules in the PM, with a median diffusion coefficient (D) of 3. 4 μm 2 /second, which was ∼ 10 times {{greater than that of}} non-raft phospholipid molecules (0. 33 μm 2 /second), despite Bdp-Chol’s proba-ble association with raft domains. Furthermore, Bdp-Chol exhibited no sign of entrapment in time scales longer than 0. 5 milliseconds. In the <b>blebbed</b> PM, where actin filaments were largely depleted, Bdp-Chol and Cy 3 -conjugated dioleoylphosphatidylethanolamine (Cy 3 -DOPE) diffused at comparable Ds (medians = 5. 8 and 6. 2 μm 2 /second, respectively), indicating that the actin-based membrane skeleton reduces the D of Bdp-Chol only by a factor of ∼ 2 from that in the <b>blebbed</b> PM, whereas it reduces the D of Cy 3 -DOPE by a factor of ∼ 20. These results are consistent with the previously proposed model, in which the PM is compartmentalized by the actin-based membrane-skeleton fence and its associated transmembrane picket proteins for the macroscopic diffusion of all of the membrane molecules, and suggest that the probability of Bdp-Chol passing through the compartment boundaries, once it enters the boundary, is ∼ 10 × greater than that of Cy 3 -DOPE. Since the compartment sizes are greater than those of the putative raft domains, we conclude that raft domains coexist with membrane-skeleton-induced compartments and are contained within them...|$|R

[...] However, {{with the use of}} cre-lox technology, a caspase 8 knock-out has been created that exhibits an increase in peripheral T cells, an impaired T cell response, and a defect in neural tube closure.

[...] Finally, a caspase 3 knock-out was characterized by ectopic cell masses in the brain and abnormal apoptotic features such as membrane <b>blebbing</b> or nuclear fragmentation. [...] A remarkable feature of these KO mice is that they have a very restricted phenotype: Casp3, 9, APAF-1 KO mice have deformations of neural tissue and FADD and Casp 8 KO showed defective heart development, however in both types of KO other organs developed normally and some cell types were still sensitive to apoptotic stimuli suggesting that unknown proapoptotic pathways exist.|$|E

The pro-apoptotic protease, caspase 3, activates ROCK kinase activity by cleaving the C-terminal PH domain. As a result, the autoinhibitory intramolecular fold of ROCK is abolished.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that problems in segregating tangled and attached chromosomes or gene amplification via the Breakage–Fusion–Bridge cycle could cause lobed nuclei or <b>blebbed</b> nuclei during the elimination of amplified DNA from the nucleus (Çavaş 2008). Likewise, the occurrence of lobed and notched nuclei has been attributed to the presence of substances able to induce cytotoxicity and it is recommended to quantify thus abnormalities separately (Bolognesi and Hayashi 2011). At this regard, the higher presence of lobed and notched nuclei in both fish species sampled at the site 3 indicates the presence of cytotoxic damage in peripheral erythrocytes; furthermore, based on our results it is possible to infer that A. gr. bimaculatus is more sensitive to the formation of this type of nuclear abnormalities.|$|R

40|$|A {{vast array}} of pathologies is typified by the {{presence}} of nuclei with an abnormal morphology. Dysmorphic nuclear phenotypes feature dramatic size changes or foldings, but also entail much subtler deviations such as nuclear protrusions called blebs. Due to their unpredictable size, shape and intensity, dysmorphic nuclei are often not accurately detected in standard image analysis routines. To enable accurate detection of dysmorphic nuclei in confocal and widefield fluorescence microscopy images, we have developed an automated segmentation algorithm, called <b>Blebbed</b> Nuclei Detector (BleND), which relies on two-pass thresholding for initial nuclear contour detection, and an optimal path finding algorithm, based on dynamic programming, for refining these contours. Using a robust error metric, we show that our method matches manual segmentation in terms of precision and outperforms state-of-the-art nuclear segmentation methods. Its high performance allowed for building and integrating a robust classifier that recognizes dysmorphic nuclei with an accuracy above 95 %.

40|$|Although {{reversible}} phosphorylation on tyrosine residues {{regulates the}} activity of many eukaryotic proteins, there are few examples {{of this type of}} regulation in bacteria. We have identified the first essential tyrosine phosphatase homolog in a bacterium, Caulobacter crescentus CtpA. ctpA mutants with altered active-site residues are nonviable, and depletion of CtpA yields chains of cells with <b>blebbed</b> outer membranes, linked by unresolved peptidoglycan. CtpA overexpression reduces cell curvature {{in a manner similar to}} deleting the intermediate filament protein crescentin, but it does not disrupt crescentin localization or membrane attach-ment. Although it has no obvious signal sequence or transmembrane-spanning domains, CtpA associates with the Caulobacter inner membrane. Immunolocalization experiments suggest that CtpA accumulates at the division site during the last quarter of the cell cycle. We propose that CtpA dephosphorylates one or more proteins involved in peptidoglycan biosynthesis or remodeling, which in turn affect cell separation, cell envelope integrity, and vibrioid morphology.
