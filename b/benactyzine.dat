5000|$|GV (IUPAC name: 2-(Dimethylamino)ethyl N,N-dimethylphosphoramidofluoridate) is an {{organophosphate}} nerve agent. GV {{is a part}} of a {{new series}} of nerve agents with properties similar to both the [...] "G-series" [...] and [...] "V-series". It is a potent acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with properties similar to other nerve agents, being a highly poisonous vapour. Treatment for poisoning with GV involves drugs such as atropine, <b>benactyzine,</b> obidoxime, and HI-6.|$|E
40|$|Transmission {{through the}} cat {{superior}} cervical ganglion was studied by recording {{the response of}} the nictitating membrane to both pre- and postganglionic cervical sympathetic nerve stimulation. The intra-arterial injection of central depressant drugs to the ganglion through the lingual artery depressed transmission through the ganglion. The central depressant drugs tested were (in decreasing order of activity) : amylobarbitone, pentobarbitone, carbromal, <b>benactyzine,</b> mephobarbitone, hydroxyzine, phenobarbitone, azacyclonol, methylpentynol carbamate, paraldehyde, phenytoin, mephenesin, chlorbutol, troxidone, methylpentynol and barbitone. All were weaker ganglion-blocking agents than tetraethylammonium. The intra-arterial injection of the central stimulant drugs leptazol, bemegride, amiphenazole and 5 -(1, 3 -dimethylbut- 2 -enyl) - 5 -ethylbarbituric acid (McN 481) also depressed ganglionic transmission. Leptazol or bemegride did not antagonize the ganglion-blocking action of amylobarbitone or troxidone. The intra-arterial injection of pecazine and perphenazine, and the intravenous injection of barbitone, <b>benactyzine,</b> azacyclonol, hydroxyzine, mephenesin, methylpentynol and paraldehyde impaired {{the response of the}} nictitating membrane to both post- and preganglionic stimulation. The implications of these observations are discussed...|$|E
40|$|A single {{injection}} {{into the}} rat of chlorpromazine, reserpine, <b>benactyzine</b> or phenobarbitone stimulates {{the release of}} corticotrophin. This effect is not seen after the drugs have been injected daily for 5 days, nor when the rats are hypophysectomized or pretreated with hydrocortisone. The stimulant effect of ether on corticotrophin release is not modified by pretreatment with a single injection, nor to any great extent after 5 daily injections of these drugs...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{performed}} to assess and compare the therapeutic efficacy of variousoximes (methoxime, BI- 6, HI- 6) combined with <b>benactyzine</b> (BNZ) in cyclosarin (GF-agent) -poisoned mice and to evaluate the influence of pretreatment with PANPAL (pyridostigmine,benactyzine and trihexyphenidyl) {{on the effect of}} antidotal treatment in mice poisoned withthe GF-agent. In the first part of our experiment, methoxime, BI- 6 or HI- 6 in combinationwith <b>benactyzine</b> were used for the treatment of GF-poisoned mice. In the second part of theexperiment the animals were pretreated with PANPAL 60 min before the GF-agent challengeand then the oxime therapy was applied in the same time scheme as before. All thetherapeutic regimens showed a protective ratio higher than 2 and significantly increased theLD 50 of GF-agent. The most efficacious oxime in decreasing of GF-agent toxicity was HI- 6. PANPAL increased the protective ratios of all therapeutic regimens in comparison withadministration of the oxime and BNZ alone. From the results obtained, the combination ofpretreatment with PANPAL and following therapy with BNZ and HI- 6 seems to be the mostefficacious therapeutic regimen for treatment of GF-agent-poisoned mice...|$|E
40|$|The {{protective}} {{effect of the}} reversible cholinesterase inhibitors tacrine and pyridostigmine alone or in combination with different drugs against acetylcholinesterase inhibition in the pontomedullar area and cerebellum of rats caused by VX agent (O-ethyl S- 2 -diisopropylaminoethyl methyl phosphonothiolate) in vivo (2 xLD 50) was studied along with survival of animals pretreated with different combinations of the drugs used. The best prophylactic effect was observed in a combination of pyridostigmine with <b>benactyzine,</b> trihexyphenidyle and HI- 6. Tacrine alone or in other combinations has had no better prophylactic effect in comparison with these combinations containing pyridostigmine. Equine butyrylcholinesterase, also protected against VX poisoning very effectively...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} {{compounds}} with structural similarities to SKF 525 -A (adiphenine. <b>benactyzine.</b> propoxyphene. diphenhydramine. desipramine. and nortriptyline) {{are capable of}} forming metabo-lite-cytochome P- 450 complexes absorbing maximally at 455 nm when metabolized by rat hepatic microsomes. The optimum substrate concentrations for the maximum rate of formation of 455 -nm complexes in microsomes from untreated rats and from rats pretreated with phenobarbital were between 25 - 50 MM. With microsomes from phenobarbital-induced rats, the maximum rate of formation of 455 -nm complexes was proportional to the concentration of induced cytochrome P- 450. The rate of formation of 455 -nm complexes was highest with microsomes from phenobarbital-induced animals, intermediate with microsomes from untreated rats...|$|E
40|$|By {{comparing}} {{the effects on}} ganglionic transmission and on the pre- and post-ganglionic nerves in the isolated superior cervical ganglion preparation of the rat, the selectivity of several drugs was assessed quantitatively. Hexamethonium, tetraethylammonium, nicotine and tubocurarine blocked transmission in concentrations which did not affect nervous conduction and {{were considered to be}} highly selective in action. Atropine, amylobarbitone and paraldehyde depressed nervous conduction appreciably in ganglion-blocking doses, but not enough to account wholly for the block in transmission and they were therefore considered as being moderately selective. The ganglion blocking actions of mephenesin, procaine, methylpentynol, methylpentynol carbamate and <b>benactyzine</b> were nonspecific, showing general depression of neuronal activity. Ganglion block with bretylium was nonselective in its site of depression of the postganglionic neurone in concentrations which only partly depressed the preganglionic nerve...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{character}} nitrogen-containing compounds {{have been}} investigated: amidopyrine, <b>benactyzine,</b> atropine, pachycarpine, promedol, strychnine a. o., {{and the new}} methods of the chemical technological analysis have been created. A possibility to forecast the optimal conditions of the BCNCC extraction depending on pKa and pH has been substantiated theoretically and has been confirmed in experiment. The program for IBM-compatible computer for design of the BCNCC ionization rate has been drawn up. The new microcrystalline reactions have been proposed. The system of the solvents for chemical-technological screening of BCNCC has been developed. The unified methods for detection of BCNCC in the biological objects on base of the extracted photometry, UV-spectrophotometry and displacement electrophoretic liquid chromatography have been proposed.

40|$|Central {{nervous system}} stimulants, {{tranquillizers}} and other {{central nervous system}} depressants, antiemetics, antihistamine drugs and autonomic blocking agents were examined {{for their ability to}} prevent the pecking response in pigeons induced by apomorphine (250 μg/kg intramuscularly). Reduction in the proportion of positive responses or significant increase in the latent period of pecking were taken as the criterion of effectiveness. Protection was afforded by caffeine, lysergic acid diethylamide, morphine, rauwolscine, triflupromazine and yohimbine. In addition, a significant increase in latent period was produced by artane, pentobarbitone, <b>benactyzine,</b> 2 -bromolysergic acid diethylamide, cyclizine, diphenhydramine, ergotoxine, hyoscine, promethazine, 5 -(2 -chloroethyl) - 4 -methylthiazole and trimethobenzamide. Most of these drugs influenced the pecking and emetic responses to apomorphine in an identical manner. It is possible that identical receptors may be concerned with apomorphine pecking (in pigeons) and emesis (in other species) ...|$|E
40|$|Soman, a {{powerful}} inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, causes {{an array of}} toxic effects in {{the central nervous system}} including convulsions, learning and memory impairments, and, ultimately, death. We report on the protection afforded by postexposure antidotal treatments, combined with pyridostigmine (0. 1 mg/kg) pretreatment, against these consequences associated with soman poisoning. Scopolamine (0. 1 mg/kg) or caramiphen (10 mg/kg) were administered 5 min after soman (1. 2 LD 50), whereas TAB (i. e., TMB 4, atropine, and <b>benactyzine,</b> 7. 5, 3, and 1 mg/kg, respectively) was injected in rats concomitant with the development of toxic signs. Atropine (4 mg/kg) was given to the two former groups at the onset of toxic symptoms. Caramiphen and TAB completely abolished electrographic seizure activity while scopolamine treatment exhibited only partial protection. Additionally, no significant alteration in the density of peripheral benzodiazepin...|$|E
40|$|Thirteen {{antihistaminic}} {{drugs and}} their analogues are tested for their extraction by headspace solid-phase microextraction from {{human whole blood}} and urine. Their determination is made by using capillary gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. Relatively high recoveries are obtained for terodiline, diphenhydramine, diphenylpyraline, and orphenadrine in urine; but the recoveries in blood extracts are 4 – 51 times lower than those in urine extracts for all drugs. <b>Benactyzine</b> and piperilate are not suited for the extraction method. The calibration curves are drawn for four drugs spiked to whole blood and for eleven drugs spiked to urine; excellent linearity is confirmed for the drugs. The detection limits for the drugs are 76 – 473 ng/mL in blood and 13 – 186 ng/mL in urine. Diphenhydramine is determined for whole blood obtained from a male subject who had received oral administration of 30 mg diphenhydramine–HC 1150 min before the sampling; the concentrations of the drug are 0. 12 and 1. 22 μg/mL for blood and urine, respectively...|$|E
40|$|The {{protective}} and anticonvulsive {{efficacy of}} two prophylactic mixtures (PANPAL consisting ofpyridostigmine, <b>benactyzine,</b> and trihexyphenidyle and pyridostigmine plus biperiden) administeredprior {{to the administration}} of soman in a lethal dose (1. 5 LD 50) with or without antidotal treatment(atropine + HI- 6) was evaluated using rats as experimental animals. The pretreatment was applied 30 and 60 min before intoxication and the antidotal therapy was administered 1 min after somanpoisoning. The anticonvulsive efficacy of both prophylactic combinations was determined using aseven degree scale. Non-treated soman-poisoned rats died within 10 min after soman challengeshowing severe tremor, subconvulsions and generalized convulsions. More than 90 % of pretreatedanimals survived for 24 hrs following soman poisoning and they were observed to be free fromsoman-induced toxic signs 24 hrs after soman administration. Our findings confirm that bothprophylactic mixtures are able not only to protect experimental animals from the lethal effects ofsoman but also to eliminate most soman-induced toxic signs. Our results confirm that bothprophylactic mixtures {{should be considered as}} a pretreatment for nerve agent poisoning, especiallyin the case of the threat of exposure to soman...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} some centrally-active {{and other drugs}} on the {{transmission}} of single nerve impulses through the isolated superior cervical ganglion preparation of the rabbit has been studied by recording both preganglionic and postganglionic action potentials. Block of conduction in the axon could be distinguished from block of the synaptic mechanism. The drugs {{did not appear to}} exert any one characteristic form of blocking action. A continuous spectrum of drug action linked an agent such as meprobamate which acted predominantly on the synapse to <b>benactyzine</b> which acted mainly by blocking axonal conduction. The drugs have been divided into three groups. Group I: hexamethonium, meprobamate, paraldehyde, amylobarbitone, methylpentynol and azacyclonal; these acted relatively selectively at the ganglion. Group II: N 714 C (the cis-isomer of chlorprothixene), prochlorperazine, methylpentynol carbamate, pipradrol, promethazine, perphenazine and procaine; the action of these drugs on the ganglion could be accounted for entirely in terms of their axonal depressant action. Group III: chlorprothixene, promazine, N 720 (dihydrochlorprothixene), chlorpromazine, hydroxyzine and benactyzine; these drugs also blocked axonal conduction but in addition they appeared to exert a “facilitating” action at the ganglionic synapse. The actions of adrenaline, adrenochrome, iproniazid, ergotoxine, mescaline and lysergic acid diethylamide on transmission were also studied. The implications of the modifications of ganglionic transmission produced by these drugs is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Organophosphorous (OP) Nerve agents (NAs) {{are known}} as the deadliest {{chemical}} warfare agents. They are divided into two classes of G and V agents. Most of them are liquid at room temperature. NAs chemical structures and mechanisms of actions are similar to OP pesticides, but their toxicities are higher than these compounds. The main mechanism of action is irreversible inhibition of Acetyl Choline Esterase (AChE) resulting in accumulation of toxic levels of acetylcholine (ACh) at the synaptic junctions and thus induces muscarinic and nicotinic receptors stimulation. However, other mechanisms have recently been described. Central nervous system (CNS) depression particularly on respiratory and vasomotor centers may induce respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Intermediate syndrome after NAs exposure is less common than OP pesticides poisoning. There are four approaches to detect exposure to NAs in biological samples: (I) AChE activity measurement, (II) Determination of hydrolysis products in plasma and urine, (III) Fluoride reactivation of phosphylated binding sites and (IV) Mass spectrometric determination of cholinesterase adducts. The clinical manifestations are similar to OP pesticides poisoning, but with more severity and fatalities. The management should be started as soon as possible. The victims should immediately {{be removed from the}} field and treatment is commenced with auto-injector antidotes (atropine and oximes) such as MARK I kit. A 0. 5 % hypochlorite solution as well as novel products like M 291 Resin kit, G 117 H and Phosphotriesterase isolated from soil bacterias, are now available for decontamination of NAs. Atropine and oximes are the well known antidotes that should be infused as clinically indicated. However, some new adjuvant and additional treatment such as magnesium sulfate, sodium bicarbonate, gacyclidine, <b>benactyzine,</b> tezampanel, hemoperfusion, antioxidants and bioscavengers have recently been used for OP NAs poisoning. </p...|$|E
40|$|To summarise, it can {{be stated}} that many psychotropic {{substances}} or drugs {{were used in the}} field of dentistry in East Germany (GDR). During the 1950 s the most commonly used psychotropic drugs used in dentistry in the GDR were herbal medizines, bromides, and bromid-urea derivatives, methyl pentinol Pentinol®), aconitine, caffeine, codeine, reserpine, numerous barbituric acid derivatives Lepinal® and Kalypnon®, the guaiacol glycerine ether Neuroton®, the <b>benactyzine</b> product Procalm®, the hydantoin derivatives Phenytoin AWD and Lepitoin® and in particular, the phenothiazine derivatives Propaphenin® (chlorpromazine) and Prothazin® (promethazine). The centrally acting analgesics Dolcontral® (pethidine) and Morphinum hydrochloricum AWD were used on in-patients, rarely on out-patients. The primary fields of indication in which psychotropic substances were administered were premedication, anxiolysis, postmedication, pain therapy, trigeminal neuralgia therapy, prophylaxis and treatment of incidents, as well as some forms of craniomandibular dysfunction. In the 1950 s premedication and anxiolysis did not yet enjoy the status they do today. In the 1960 s the first minor tranquilizers manufactured in the GDR – Meprobamat (1961) as well as the benzodiazepine derivatives Timosin® (chlordiazepoxide 1967), Faustan® (diazepam 1968) and Radedorm® (nitrazepam 1969) – came onto the pharmaceuticals market and were successfully applied for their respective purposes in nearly all fields of indication in dentistry. The minor tranquilizer Radepur® (previously Timosin®) and, in particular, Faustan® proved to be the treatment of choice in the spheres of premedication, anxiolysis, prophylaxis and treatment of incidents. In the early 1970 s the minor tranquilizer Rudotel® (medazepam 1973) and the antiepileptic agent Finlepsin® (carbamazepine 1974) came onto the pharmaceuticals market in the GDR. The non-cardioselective beta-blocker Obsidan® (propranolol 1969) and the cardioselective beta-blocker Cordanum® (talinolol 1976) displayed excellent effectiveness, especially in the premedication, anxiolysis, prophylaxis and treatment of certain cardiovascular diseases, but they did not succeed in becoming permanently established in the sphere of anxiolysis and premedication in dentistry. In the 1980 s there were not outstanding developments and changes as regards the application of psychotropic substances in dentistry. The broadest range of applications was that of the group of minor tranquilizers from the benzodiazepine class of drugs. All neuropsychotropic drugs in the GDR were available only on prescription. The centrally acting analgesics such as Dolcontral® and Morphinum hydrocloricum AWD were subject to the Narcotics Act. The benzodiazepines are currently still the medications of choice for anxiolysis and premedication in dentistry...|$|E
