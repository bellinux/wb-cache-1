In retrospect, Boles sometimes regretted not having gone {{to one of the}} historically black colleges and universities. He dropped out of classes <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> [...] "didn't want to be crutching around campus" [...] and he eventually stopped rehabbing his knee and became irregular with his workouts. After the injury, he dropped out of school and fell onto hard times.|$|E

500|$|Leslie sees Jeanine Restrepo (Loretta Fox), an {{influential}} zoning board member {{who could help}} Leslie with her plans to turn the Sullivan Street pit into a park. Leslie is too nervous to approach her, so she practices with Mark (Paul Schneider), who teasingly pinches her nose <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> as Jeanine, [...] "I can do whatever I want"; Ann pinches Mark's nose and Leslie pinches Ann's, and Mark summarizes, [...] "It's fun {{to pretend to be}} zoning board members." [...] Marlene suggests Leslie try sucking up to Jeanine in her speech, but it comes across awkwardly when Leslie claims to [...] "love" [...] Jeanine. When Leslie tries to approach her later, Jeanine suggests Leslie make an appointment with her secretary. Marlene says this means Jeanine is blowing them off, and tells Leslie to blackmail Jeanine with the knowledge that her husband has a DUI offense in Illinois. Leslie shares the advice with Ann, who says she believes it is unethical and wrong; offended, Leslie accuses Ann of pampering Andy. ("He's got three crutches, {{and one of them is}} you. And the other two are crutches.") Ann storms off.|$|E

2500|$|Complementarian scholar Wayne A. Grudem {{objects to}} Webb's use of [...] "complementary" [...] and [...] "egalitarian" [...] {{together}} {{to describe a}} thoroughly egalitarian position. Calling the terminology [...] "offensive and confusing," [...] he reasons that doing so simply confuses the issues by using the term [...] "complementary" [...] for a position totally antithetical to what complementarians hold. Grudem finds Webb's {{use of the term}} [...] "patriarchy" [...] to be especially pejorative because of its connotations in modern society. He also rejects the term [...] "hierarchicalist" [...] <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> it overemphasizes structured authority while giving no suggestion of equality or the beauty of mutual interdependence.|$|E

He was arrested on 10 April at the airport on his way back to England because of an alleged passport irregularity. Initially interrogated by Pakistani and British officials, he told Stafford Smith: [...] "The British checked out my story and said they knew I was a nobody. They said they would tell the Americans."

5000|$|After {{its premiere}} at the Toronto Film Festival, Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly called Collapse “one {{of the few}} true buzz films of the festival” and wrote that “you may want to dispute Ruppert, {{but more than that}} you’ll want to hear him, <b>because</b> what <b>he</b> <b>says</b> — right or wrong, prophecy or {{paranoia}} — takes up residence in your mind.” ...|$|R

2500|$|This is {{represented}} by the show's promotional tagline, [...] "Small town Canada with a little Muslim twist": the religious angle, while always present, is largely tied to and sometimes even secondary to standard and universal sitcom themes such as family, friends and the humour in everyday life. For example, while the show sometimes tackles storylines with a political edge, such as a character claiming to be unable to attend a conference in the United States <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> he was wrongly placed on a no-fly list (when in fact he is simply afraid of flying) or the mosque being raided by the Canadian Security Intelligence Service, even these situations are explored as much for their humour as their politics. The show much more commonly explores purely comedic issues such as whether a Muslim woman still has to cover her hair if the only man who can see her is gay, whether Muslims can curl, whether to haggle with the carpet salesman when buying a prayer rug, or whether a Muslim woman's head scarf is enough to mitigate a bad hair day. Television critics have also credited this very combination of an attention-grabbing premise with conventional and familiar sitcom themes as one of the primary reasons that the show successfully retained an audience after its debut.|$|E
2500|$|The Speaker begins Sonnet 4 (quatrain 1) {{by asking}} his male friend why he must waste his beauty on himself, because nature doesn’t give people gifts besides {{the ones we}} get at birth. However, nature does lend {{to those who are}} generous with their own beauty. The second quatrain is about the speaker asking a friend, the subject of the poem, why he abuses the {{plentiful}} and generous gifts he was given, which are meant to be shared with others. Then the speaker goes on to ask why he vows to be a bad shareholder, using up what he has to offer but not able to care for himself or reserve his own money. One literary piece sums this up as the [...] "idea of miser versus money-lender". This is questioning whether or not he should loan money. [...] Should he be a lender or should he keep from giving his money away, coming off as a miser. In quatrain 3, the speaker is trying to persuade his male friend to have children <b>because</b> <b>he</b> <b>says</b> that not doing so would be a waste of the man’s beauty. The speaker says that {{there is no reason why}} his friend should remain alone and let his beauty die off with him. Joseph Pequigney said that Shakespeare's sonnets have [...] "erotic attachment and sexual involvement with the fair young man with whom all of sonnets 1-126 are concerned". Sonnet 4 clearly is a part of this group and does indeed have some references that can be taken as emotional descriptions. The couplet suggests that the young man has valuable attraction that is not being used properly or appreciated.|$|E
