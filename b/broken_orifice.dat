Moseler and U Landman. During the heating, the hot liquid ejects through the <b>broken</b> <b>orifice</b> into vacuum, and forms a condensed trail in the tadpole shape {{as shown in the}} TEM micrographs. The temperature-variable Raman spectra indicates that the nanojet formation is closely related to the heating temperature and thus essentially to the internal pressure in the coated clusters. The pressure inside the shell, which rises from the inner core's melting and its confined volume expansion and then drops after the final explosion, dominates the whole nanojetting process...|$|E

The performed analysis {{is based on the}} evaluation of the discharge, velocity and contraction coefficients for different water orifices. In order to overcome the difficulty to measure the water velocity at the orifice exit, which can reach 900 m/s in case of pure water jet applications (without abrasive additives), a suitable laser Doppler measurement system has been applied. An analysis of orifice performances is presented in the present paper, also considering the case of <b>broken</b> <b>orifices,</b> very important for industrial applications...|$|R
