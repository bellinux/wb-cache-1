To measure the effectiveness of the <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and furrows, angle iron stakes and profile transects were installed to measure soils loss and accompanying change in the soil profile. The profile transects gave a reliable measure of the change in the height of the soil surface in constructed pits and across contour furrows. Because of the shrinking and swelling of the soil, the change in height of the angle iron stakes was found to be much more than the reduction in soil surface caused by erosion. High intensity thunderstorms, occuring mostly during July, August, and September, cause most of the erosion from the semi-arid land.

40|$|A {{study of}} the {{microclimate}} of erosion control treatments {{was carried out in}} two habitat types in a semiarid southeastern Utah, salt desert shrub area. The soils are highly eroded Mancos shale and support a low density of salt desert shrub species which offers little protection against high intensity summer convectional rainstorms. <b>Gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and contour furrows had been installed by the Bureaus of Reclamation and Land Management to prevent runoff of soil laden water which results from these summer rainfalls. Formerly this sediment was carried to the Colorado River and deposited in Lake Powell. The purpose to t he study was to measure some parameters that influenced establishment and survival of seedlings which would stabilize the structures and increase the productivity of the area. Mature, indigenous species close to the structures had greater vigor and provided a larger, more constant seed source. This seed source was important since original seedlings of introduced grasses have failed to establish and stabilize the structures. Following favorable late winter and early spring precipitation, high numbers of seedlings emerged, but few survived into mid-summer. Those that did survive were found only at or near the high water line of the <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and in the bottom of contour furrows. To aid in the explanation of the differential seedling survival, soil surface moisture following rainstorms, physical and chemical soil characteristics, net radiation, soil surface temperature, and evaporation were investigated. Sampling of the 15 centimeter soil surface in the environs of the structures showed that two days after either heavy or light rainfalls, essentially no available water remained on the sloping throw positions of the structures. The bottom of the <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> remained flooded for several days. As a result, the seedlings were drowned. Only at the high water line of the <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and in the bottom of furrows was there enough water to support seedling growth in summer. Runoff water from summer storms carried fine material into the structures, which covered and destroyed seedlings, plus lowered infiltration and permitted much of the water to be lost through evaporation. The runoff water also carried salts brought to the surface by the desert shrubs or by the upward movement of water during evaporation from the soil surface. Sampling of soil in the environs of the structures showed no substantial build up of salt, indicating that leaching had occurred, or still was occurring. This does not mean that a build up will not result in the future. Seasonal salt distribution showed that lowest salinity levels did not always coincide with springtime when seedlings generally emerged. Established seedlings were also exposed to a harsh environment of high soil surface temperatures (over 60 C) and high soil water evaporation rates that were detrimental to their survival. In summary, the study showed that the erosion control structures have created a microenvironment much different from the undisturbed soil, which only permits the establishment of species with much different tolerances from the indigenous species...|$|R
40|$|Soil {{erosion and}} {{environmental}} degradation are serious problems facing food security in Haiti. In 1999, the annual soil loss due to erosion {{was estimated at}} 36 million m 3 tons. The government of Haiti has been aware of these deteriorating conditions and has sought international assistance to reduce these problems. In 1993, the United States Agency for International Development implemented a soil conservation project {{and millions of dollars}} were spent on the encouragement of adoption of soil conservation measures; yet the problems of soil degradation is still menacing food security in Haiti. Hence the need to evaluate the impact of soil conservation in Haiti is important. A survey of 951 farmers, who adopted soil conservation techniques in Haiti, was conducted. The survey participants were composed of 83. 6 % males and 16. 2 % females. About 53. 3 % were illiterate and 42. 9 and 4. 0 % received up to eight years schooling and primary education, respectively. The age group range included 8. 5 % who were less than 30, 30. 8 % who were between 30 and 45 years old and 32. 6 % who were between 45 and 60, and 28. 1 % who were above 60 years old. The results showed that the soil conservation techniques most commonly adopted by farmers were crop bands, alley cropping, rock walls, and <b>gully</b> <b>plugs.</b> Most farmers were satisfied with the soil conservation techniques adopted and they were aware of the benefits of these techniques. There {{was no significant difference in}} income per ha for the soil conservation techniques: alley cropping, rock walls and <b>gully</b> <b>plugs.</b> The net income per ha for crop bands was superior to that of alley cropping, rock walls and <b>gully</b> <b>plugs.</b> All models had a good fit as shown by a relatively high adjusted R 2 and a low mean square error. The model results showed in general the number of plots, the elevation, the number of trees greater than 10 centimeters in circumference, the evaluation of the soil by farmers as fertile and the number of crops unique to the soil conservation technique positively influence the net revenue per ha.

40|$|Watershed {{management}} is an emerging concept for the {{efficient use of}} rain run-off {{in the rural areas}} of India. The approach to watershed {{management is}} participatory in nature, people friendly, location specific, processed based and geared to cater to the problems and needs of the rural communities. Operation of watershed management is ideal where the rainfall pattern is very short, uneven and there is no support of major and minor irrigation systems to enhance agricultural production. The principle of watershed management is the proper management of all the precipitation by way of collection, storage and efficient utilisation of run-off water and use of groundwater. The re-harvesting of run-off in the study area of watershed management is achieved by managing 25 % of the total rainfall and 25 % of the run-off to generate crop-growing area, through four re-harvesting mechanisms such as tanks, farm ponds, contour bunds and structures such as <b>gully</b> <b>plugs</b> and surface detention in depression.

Both the studies validate the hydrogeomorphic {{classification of}} landforms studied through field work and remote sensing techniques. The hydrogeochemistry of denudational landforms reveals that the quality of water is good, but replenishment during monsoon is very small. Hence, these landforms have to be preserved from deterioration and are ideal target for artificial recharge for a better tomorrow in Mumbai Island. Continuous contour trenches (CCT), loose boulder structures (<b>gully</b> <b>plugs)</b> are the most suitable structures for hilly area as these structures will function initially as soil conservation structure and subsequently improve the soil moisture retention and also enhance the recharge to groundwater. These structures will also improve sustainability of springs thereby improving water supply scenario in the small hamlets situated in hilly areas.

40|$|The {{main problem}} of {{agricultural}} {{activities in the}} steep slope upland area if without adequate soil conservation practices {{is that it will}} results in soil erosion. Soil erosion causes agricultural land degradation which reduces the physical, chemical, and biological soil roperties and decreases land productivities. Soil erosion is very harmful to agricultural land productivities, because loss of the fertile topsoil in a relatively short time causes decrease of fertility and productivity of the soils. The role of conservation techniques are the way of soil conservation, which have three principles of definitions, i. e. a) to protect the soil against soil degradation, b) to improve the degraded soil, and c) to make the soil more fertile. Soil conservation practice in the field have used two methods i. e. mechanical conservation methods and vegetative conservation methods. Mechanical conservation method is the earth embankments constructed across the slope to intercept surface run off and to protect soil erosion (soil cultivation along the contour, terraces constructed, contour bank, waterways ditch, drop structure, silt pit, checkdam, <b>gully</b> <b>plug,</b> etc). While the vegetative methode are reducing the kinetic energy of the raindrops on the soil surface, reducing the run off velocity, increasing infiltration rate and reducing soil water contents. The effectiveness of soil conservation techniques in uplands area on the the soil erosion and the land productivity is different in each location. This is because of the difference of the land capability (site specific, soil behavior and properties, and the climate).

Three villages, comprising 494 households, were selected as partners. Participatory management and evaluation were essential components of the project. Water-harvesting and-spreading technologies {{were put in place}} at demonstration sites over an area of 1, 000 ha. Fourteen masonry check-dams and 3 ferrocement gabions provided about 73, 000 cu m of water for the partner villages and outlying areas. Twenty-six households utilized roofwater-harvesting systems. Up to 20 percent of households took water from six developed springs. Several dug wells were deepened and existing bore wells received workovers. The increase in water availability during the pre-monsoon period was about 750 l/d per capita. Runoff was diverted into shallow aquifers, by means of expanded terracing of hillsides, combined with systems of contour trenches and soil bunds, as well as 19 farm ponds. Infiltration pits were excavated, most notably on unterraced hillslopes. Soil conservation in support of water-resource management involved the use of 75 gabions, 75 drystone bunds and 6, 550 <b>gully</b> <b>plugs.</b> These measures averted erosion losses of up to 150 tonnes of soil per hectare.

40|$|The Bosque River Watershed {{is located}} in the Brazos River Basin in central Texas and is facing a suite of water quality issues {{resulting}} in sediment, nutrient and bacteria loading. These loadings are potentially derived from improperly managed cropland and grazing land, land-applied dairy waste, and effluent discharge from eight wastewater treatment plants. The first phase of the project developed an effective methodology for determining priority areas in the watershed where best management practice (BMP) implementation would likely yield the greatest improvements in water quality. The objectives of this project (Phase II) are to apply the Soil and Watershed Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to simulate and evaluate the impacts of implementing several best management practices (a) in the entire watershed, and (b) at incremental levels in high, medium, and low priority areas of the watershed, identified using three different impact indices. Initially, the SWAT model was calibrated for long-term annual and monthly flow at a USGS gaging station located in the lower portion of the watershed for the period from 1980 through 2005 and was validated at the same location for the period 1960 through 1979. The model was also calibrated, at a monthly time step, for water quality parameters including sediment, organic and mineral nitrogen, and phosphorus at two locations, Hico and Valley Mills. Model performance statistics (coefficient of determination and Nash-Sutcliffe modeling efficiency) indicated that model performance was satisfactory and could be used for evaluating the impacts of alternative management scenarios to reduce nonpoint source pollution. BMPs including streambank stabilization, <b>gully</b> <b>plugs,</b> recharge structures, conservation tillage, terraces, contour farming, grazing management, manure incorporation, edge-of-field filter strips, and PL- 566 reservoirs were simulated as being implemented in the watershed areas that met the respective practice?s specific criteria for implementation. These BMPs were simulated individually and the resulting farm level (HRU level), subwatershed level, and watershed outlet level impacts were quantified for each BMP. Reductions in sediment load at the watershed outlet, as a result of implementing these BMPs individually, was as much as 37 percent while reductions in total nitrogen (TN) ranged from 1 percent to 24 percent and total phosphorus (TP) varied from a 3 percent increase to a 30 percent decrease. The 3 percent increase is indicative of conservation tillage and is likely caused by the lack of soil inversion and mixing, which yields an accumulation of dissolved (mineral) phosphorus in the soil?s surface layer. At subwatershed levels, reductions brought about by implementing the BMPs were relatively greater as compared to the watershed outlet reductions. Reductions in sediment were as high as 47 percent and reductions in TN and TP were 37 percent and 32 percent, respectively. Subwatersheds were categorized into ?high,? ?medium,? and ?low? priority based on calibrated simulation results. Considering sediment, TN, and TP (as pollutants), three types of total impact indices were estimated. The ?Concentration Impact Index? is based on pollutant concentrations (SWAT output values extracted from the ?reach output file?), considers contributions from the subwatershed as well as the entire upstream watershed, and is effective in determining priority areas for addressing localized pollution problems in low and high flow conditions. The ?Load Per Unit Area Impact Index? is based on the total pollutant load coming from a specific area (SWAT output values extracted from the ?subbasin output file?), considers contributions from an individual subwatershed, and is used to effectively assign a priority to each subwatershed. The ?Load Impact Index? is based on pollutant loads from subwatersheds and upstream areas (SWAT output values extracted from the ?reach output file?) and portrays the cumulative effects of pollutant loading throughout the entire watershed. Priority areas in the watershed varied based on which impact index was used in the evaluation; therefore, the areas where BMP implementations were evaluated differed between simulations. Despite varying BMP implementation sites, all BMPs were modeled incrementally, first on high priority subwatersheds followed by medium and low priority subwatersheds. BMPs considered for implementing in prioritized subwatersheds included streambank stabilization, recharge structures, conservation tillage, terracing, grazing management, and manure incorporation. When comparing the reductions achieved from implementation of BMPs using the three impact indices, load per unit area criteria typically yielded higher pollutant reductions. This outcome is likely a result of the majority of BMPs simulated in this study addressing upland pollutant reductions rather than in-stream reductions. Therefore, these BMPs resulted in larger pollutant reductions because they targeted local upland areas that typically generate higher pollutant loads. Implementing these BMPs in the entire watersheds resulted in sediment, TN, and TP load reductions of 73 percent, 43 percent, and 68 percent, respectively...|$|R
40|$|The {{availability}} of adequate and reliable water supplies {{has always been}} a critical concern in central Arizona since prehistoric times. The early European settlers in 1868 initially utilized the ancient Hohokam Indian canal system which drew water from the Salt River. However, the river fluctuated with periods of drought and periods of high flows which destroyed the diversion structures. The settlers proposed a dam to store water and to regulate flows. In 1903, the Salt River Water Users Association was formed and an agreement was reached with the U. S. Government {{for the construction of a}} dam on the Salt River at its junction with Tonto Creek. The Salt River drains more than 4, 306 square miles (mi 2) from the White Mountains of eastern Arizona to the confluence with Tonto Creek. Tonto Creek drains a 1, 000 -mi 2 watershed above the confluence. The agreement was authorized under the Reclamation Act of 1902. The Theodore Roosevelt Dam was started in 1905, completed in 1911, and dedicated in 1911 (Salt River Project 2002). The dam has the capacity to store 2. 9 million acre-feet (af) of water. However, between 1909 and 1925, 101, 000 af of sediment were accumulated behind Roosevelt Dam (Rich 1961). Much of it came from erosion on the granitic soils from the chaparral lands above the reservoir, and much of the erosion was blamed on overgrazing by domestic livestock. Water users were concerned that accelerated sedimentation would eventually compromise the capacity of the dam to hold sufficient water for downstream demands. The Tonto National Forest was originally created to manage the watershed above Roosevelt Dam and to prevent siltation. The Summit Plots, located between Globe, Arizona, and Lake Roosevelt were established in 1925 by the U. S. Department of Agriculture to study the effects of vegetation recovery, mechanical stabilization, and plant cover changes on stormflows and sediment yields from the lower chaparral zone (Rich 1961). The area initially was part of the Crook National Forest which was later added to the Tonto National Forest. The Summit Watersheds consisted of nine small watersheds ranging in size from 0. 37 to 1. 23 acres (ac). Elevations are between 3, 636 and 3, 905 feet (ft). The treatments included: exclusion of livestock and seeding grasses, winter grazing, hardware cloth check dams, grubbing <b>brush,</b> sloping <b>gullies</b> and grass seeding. Protection from grazing did not pro duce changes in runoff or sedimentation. Treatments that reduced surface runoff also reduced erosion. Hardware cloth check dams reduce total erosion, and mulch plus grass treatments checked erosion and sediment movement. Runoff was reduced by the combined treatments (Rich 1961). The Summit Watersheds were integrated into the Parker Creek Erosion-Streamflow Station in 1932...|$|R
40|$|The two {{programmes}} identified about 1000 farmer innovators {{and concluded}} that innovation is a fairly common phenomenon in regions where there is high population pressure on available natural resources. This is not surprising as farmers have to adapt to changes in rainfall, soils, demographics and markets, for example, in order to survive. Farmers with their ´backs against the wall´ have no choice: innovate to improve their livelihoods, {{continue to live in}} poverty or leave the land and settle elsewhere. Farmer innovators Innovators were identified by extension agents or by field staff of NGOs as well as by researchers. They not only observed farmers who were doing things differently, but also asked villagers whether they knew of farmers who were achieving better results than others who were producing under similar conditions. In Tunisia, the partners created a special weekly programme on ´agriculture and innovation´ for a regional radio station. Farmers responded positively to this programme and some submitted reports on their innovations to the radio station. Farmers improved technologies in areas such as soil and water conservation, water harvesting, soil fertility management and agroforestry and tested new crops and new crop varieties in their farming systems. Not all of the innovations were technical in nature; some farmers also defined new rules for the management of a community resource, such as water for irrigation. The improved traditional planting pits used in the Sahel to rehabilitate seriously degraded land are a well-known example of farmer innovation in the early 1980 s. Farmers drew upon many sources of inspiration for their innovations. Many picked up ideas while working elsewhere, and upon return, tried the new techniques on their own fields. In other cases they experimented with ideas gleaned from extension agents, study visits to research stations or from projects in other regions. However, some were {{as a result of their}} own creativity. Most innovators were fairly old and experienced but some were young. In Cameroon, a small network of 15 innovators had four members aged 23 - 32 years. These were young men who, after losing their jobs in urban centres during the economic crisis in Cameroon in the 1990 s, returned to their home villages and took up farming. Most innovators were illiterate, but the ability to be innovative was not related to the level of formal education. Most were men, but an increase in the number of female innovators was noted when women were involved in the identification process. Most of the innovators had strong personalities and were capable of withstanding considerable social pressure. Tensue Gebremedhin, a widow in Tigray, Ethiopia, started to plough with an ox and a donkey and by doing so broke two taboos: a woman behind a plough with a donkey in front of it. In East Africa, 33 % of innovators identified were women and their innovations in land husbandry did not differ from those of men. In Tanzania, for example, Mrs Grace Bura built up barriers with earth and <b>brush</b> to block <b>gullies,</b> and Mrs Martha Mwaso reclaimed large sections of riverbed through labour-intensive efforts. In Kenya, Mrs Kalekye excavated large quantities of earth to reclaim gullies for agricultural production. All innovators increased their production and income, and were considered to be better off because of their innovations. Data from Tanzania and from Burkina Faso show that many innovators who were resource-poor 10 - 20 years ago are now resource-rich. By investing in land rehabilitation, innovators in Burkina Faso systematically expanded their resource base and produced sufficient food to feed their families even in drought years. Not only did they build up their assets, but they also became less vulnerable to drought. Chains of innovation Some innovations triggered others. Innovators in Babanki, Cameroon, for example, contributed to a significant increase in the production of nightshade (Solanum nigrum) as a result of improved soil fertility management and the construction of a network of irrigation canals. A farmer then devised a simple, low-cost harvesting tool to cut leaves quickly and efficiently without damaging the plants. Improving the marketing channels was their next project. Farmer innovation and formal research Both regional programmes emphasized that farmer innovations are not necessarily perfect. They can be improved and it is essential to build partnerships between researchers and innovators for joint experimentation based on agendas set by the farmers. The case of innovators in Cameroon who expressed their problems and their priorities clearly, and were accepted by researchers, is a good example. In Tunisia the programme of experimentation was more researcher-driven, but responded adequately to farmers´ priorities. Working with farmer innovators requires a change in attitudes for many researchers. They need to communicate with farmers as equals and should be willing and able to listen to and learn from farmers. Innovation and extension Top-down approaches to extension have failed to produce tangible results. It is still too often assumed that there are sufficient, readily available technologies that can be transferred to farmers. More participatory approaches to extension have not yet been mainstreamed. It has been repeatedly demonstrated and reported that farmers are keen to learn from fellow farmers, and that they often more readily accept innovations observed on the fields of other farmers working under similar conditions than messages transmitted by extension agents. When farmers from Niger went on a study tour to Burkina Faso in 1989, they were impressed by the improved traditional planting pits used to rehabilitate degraded land. Some applied this technique on their return [...] The results were surprisingly good, even in 1990, which was a drought year. This success led to the accelerated dissemination of this technique and, by 1992, the emergence of a farmers´ land market with farmers actively buying and selling degraded land. Building on farmer innovation implies a fundamental change in the roles of extension agents from transmitters of technical messages to facilitators of knowledge exchange between farmers and other farmers and between farmers and extension officers themselves. Recent initiatives The number of initiatives to promote farmer experimentation and innovation seems to be increasing. In March 2004 CTA and IFAD organized a regional workshop in West Africa on farmer innovation and extension. IFAD subsequently launched an Innovation Mainstreaming Initiative and ICRAF and partners developed a proposal to promote farmer experimentation and innovation in the Sahel. The creativity of farmers in Africa and other ACP regions remains a major untapped resource that can be used to realize the promise and potential of ACP agricultural and rural development. The challenge is for policymakers, researchers and extensionists to embrace farmer innovation as a valuable tool for transforming ACP agriculture.
