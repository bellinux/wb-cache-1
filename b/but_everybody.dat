5|$|After Gallagher's {{team had}} {{returned}} to the Special Forces Camp, Van Cleeff waited on the runway for two minutes to extract the survivors, but when nobody appeared he pulled the throttle and took off. As soon as Van Cleeff's aircraft was airborne, another C-130 pilot reported to General McLaughlin that the evacuation had been completed, and the facility could now be destroyed at will. Van Cleeff quickly notified all aircraft in the vicinity that he had just reinserted the CCT. Gallagher's team searched the Special Forces compound, the Americal Division battalion command post, and the artillery compound, <b>but</b> <b>everybody</b> either had been evacuated or was dead. Additionally, Khâm Đức was in North Vietnamese hands, so Gallagher and the other two men ran to the ditch beside the runway, where they tried to make contact with the aircraft overhead, but the radio was disabled along with all other equipment. While waiting for a miracle, members of the CCT clashed with North Vietnamese troops who had set up a machine gun position beneath the wing of Delmore's crashed C-130, and successfully disabled their opponent's weapon.|$|E

25|$|Programs are set {{up around}} the country in hopes to educate {{individuals}} with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, <b>but</b> <b>everybody</b> in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.|$|E

25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few people knew it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, <b>but</b> <b>everybody</b> {{will be talking about}} it to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E
25|$|National LEB figures {{reported}} by statistical national agencies {{and international organizations}} are indeed estimates of period LEB. In the Bronze Age and the Iron Age, LEB was 26 years; the 2010 world LEB was 67.2 years. For recent years, in Swaziland LEB is about 49, and in Japan, it is about 83. The combination of high infant mortality and deaths in young adulthood from accidents, epidemics, plagues, wars, and childbirth, particularly before modern medicine was widely available, significantly lowers LEB. But for those who survive early hazards, a life expectancy of 60 or 70 would not be uncommon. For example, a society with a LEB of 40 may have few people dying at precisely 40: most will die before 30 or after 55. In populations with high infant mortality rates, LEB is highly sensitive to the rate {{of death in the}} first few years of life. Because of this sensitivity to infant mortality, LEB can be subjected to gross misinterpretation, leading one to believe that a population with a low LEB will necessarily have a small proportion of older people. For example, in a hypothetical stationary population in which half the population dies before the age of five <b>but</b> <b>everybody</b> else dies at exactly 70 years old, LEB will be about 36, but about 25% of the population will be between the ages of 50 and 70. Another measure, such as life expectancy at age 5 (e5), can be used to exclude the effect of infant mortality to provide a simple measure of overall mortality rates other than in early childhood; in the hypothetical population above, life expectancy at 5 would be another 65. Aggregate population measures, such as the proportion of the population in various age groups, should also be used along individual-based measures like formal life expectancy when analyzing population structure and dynamics.|$|E
25|$|On to the Adelaide Oval, {{or rather}} {{not as the}} SACA ringed off the famously long curves, much to the {{disappointment}} of those who liked seeing all-run fives when batsmen hit a straight-drive. South Australia had not won the Sheffield Shield for ten years, but were to do so again in 1963-64 {{with the help of}} their multi-talented import Gary Sobers. They were captained by the old favourite Les Favell and had a 19-year-old Ian Chappell in the team, but their Chinaman bowler David Sincock was unable to play because of his exams. The Melbourne Cup was due to be played during the match, so Ted Dexter and the Duke were off to the races and Colin Cowdrey was in charge. Favell won the toss, batted, and saw his side make steady progress to 324/7 {{by the end of the}} day. Favell was first out for 7 and his fellow-opener John Causby was run out by Ken Barrington and wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 16, but John Lill (87) and Gary Sobers (42) stroked their way to a third-wicket stand of 113 before they were both out on 154, along with Neil Dansie for a duck and South Australia were 154/4. Ian McLachlan (53) and Ian Chappell (36) added 66 before the youngster tripped over himself while hooking Brian Statham and hit the wicket with his bat. Statham (4/58) cleared up the tail with 3 wickets for 11 runs and South Australia were out for 335. Fred Titmus (1/80) and Ray Illingworth (0/43) failed to turn the ball on the notoriously flat wicket and Cowdrey set up defensive fields which rather relied on the batsmen getting themselves out, still the runs flowed enough and the crowd enjoyed themselves. Cowdrey was out for this third consecutive duck when acting as opener, <b>but</b> <b>everybody</b> else had a fine time; Geoff Pullar (21) added 55 for the second-wicket with Ken Barrington (102), who added another 168 with the stylish Tom Graveney (99), beating the third-wicket record for the MCC vs South Australia set by Plum Warner and George Gunn in 1911-12. Graveney was the more polished of the two, but Barrington hit Neil Hawke (6/130) for 4 boundaries in five balls. They and Peter Parfitt (15) were all out by 257/5, but the depth of the MCC batting was shown by Fred Titmus who hit a solid 137 not out, his highest first class century, adding 108 runs with Barry Knight (55) and 121 with wicket-keeper Alan Smith (another 55) and Cowdrey declared on 508/9. South Australia knocked off the 173 run deficit the same day, making 174/5 by stumps, with Sobers (99) run out by Statham going for his 100th run and everybody else chipping in. A shower of rain allowed everybody to get off the field to watch the Melbourne Cup and Favell declared on 283/7 to leave the MCC 67 minutes to make 111 runs. They made 95/1, thanks to some quick hitting by Pullar (56), but after playing into more rain they gave up 16 runs short in an affable, but farcical end. On a flat wicket with indifferent bowling the teams made 1,221 runs in four days despite the rain.|$|E

Although it was greatly cut for syndication, Bacheller attested to its causing a stir, saying [...] "its quality [...] immediately felt and recognized."

[...] Emotions ran high as the last shots of the cast were captured; Shatner said, [...] "By the time we finished the last scene, which extended longer than we expected, {{there was a sense of}} irritation.

Doug Dowdle of Parallax Productions, a company that pioneered in movie tie-in music videos during the 1980s, created this video from edited footage of the movie, directed by Susan Seidelman. This was done because there were five Madonna videos already on power rotation on MTV, and Warner Bros. {{did not want the}} audience to be saturated with any new video. Hence, they decided to use the shots from the film and made a music video. During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna commented: [...] "'Into the Groove' is another song I feel retarded singing, <b>but</b> <b>everybody</b> seems to like it." ...|$|E

500|$|Azaria {{became famous}} for his voice work in the ongoing {{animated}} television series The Simpsons. He joined the show having previously performed only one voice-over—as the titular animated dog in the failed Fox pilot Hollywood Dog, a show he described as [...] "sort of Roger Rabbit-esque, where the dog was animated, <b>but</b> <b>everybody</b> else was real." [...] The first voice he performed on The Simpsons was that of town bartender Moe Szyslak, replacing Christopher Collins who had initially recorded the character's voice. Having known him from Hollywood Dog, casting director Bonita Pietila called Azaria {{and asked him to}} audition for the voice of Moe. At the time he was performing the role of a drug dealer in a play, utilizing a voice based on actor Al Pacino's performance in the film Dog Day Afternoon. He used the voice in his audition for The Simpsons and, {{at the request of the}} show's executive producers Matt Groening and Sam Simon, made the voice more [...] "gravelly". Groening and Simon thought the resultant voice was ideal for Moe and took Azaria over to the Fox recording studio. Before he had even seen a script, he recorded several lines of dialogue as Moe for the episode [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", dubbing Collins' voice.|$|E

Lou Lumenick of The New York Post hailed Hairspray as [...] "The best and most entertaining movie adaptation of a stage musical so far this century— and yes, I’m including the Oscar-winning Chicago," [...] calling it [...] "one of the best-cast movies in recent memory..." [...] New York Daily News critic Jack Matthews called the film [...] "A great big sloppy kiss of entertainment for audiences weary of explosions, CGI effects and sequels, sequels, sequels." [...] The Baltimore Sun review offered Michael Sragow's opinion that [...] "in its entirety, Hairspray has the funny tilt that only a director-choreographer like Shankman can give to a movie," [...] pointing out that Shankman skillfully [...] "puts a new-millennial zing behind exact re-creations of delirious period dances like the Mashed Potato." [...] Dana Stevens from Slate called Hairspray [...] "intermittently tasty, if a little too frantically eager to please."
