50|$|In the {{upstream}} direction, the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s bands overlap. 1 Gbit/s band spreads from 1260 to 1360 nm; 10 Gbit/s band uses 1260 to 1280 nm band. This allows both upstream {{channels to}} share spectrum region characterized by low chromatic dispersion, but requires the 1 Gbit/s and 10 Gbit/s channels {{to be separated}} in time domain.

The FBMC signal is sent through a quasistatic channel, if not indicated otherwise, modeled {{according to the}} International Telecommunication Union ITU-R Vehicular-A Channel guidelines [44]. This means, that {{for the duration of}} a <b>transmission</b> <b>burst,</b> the channel remains constant in time unless a certain mobility is indicated. In this case, the fading varies with time according to the mobile velocity. For each simulation, 3000 independent <b>burst</b> <b>transmissions</b> with independent channel realizations are performed. The estimation of the synchronization parameters and the channel state relies on scattered pilots obtained with the auxiliary pilot technique. The combined pilot/auxiliary pilot symbol is boosted on average by 4.5 [*]dB with respect to the data. The overall channel response is obtained from the scattered channel estimates by triangulation-based linear interpolation between the pilots.

Its implementation complexity is relatively high but its accuracy achieves the Cramerâ€“Rao bound. The second scheme is still based on the ML criterion, but the training sequence is periodic, which helps to reduce the computational load. The third scheme also employs periodic sequences, but its structure comes from heuristic reasoning.

By exploiting the unconjugated cyclostationary statistics induced by oversampling in the received waveform, an optimized carrier frequency offset estimator is proposed and its asymptotic (large sample) performance analyzed. In order for the proposed fre-quency estimator to achieve the minimum mean-square estimation error, it is shown that the oversampling rate need not be larger than twice the symbol rate. It is also shown that the proposed synchronizer is asymptotically jitter-free, admits a feedforward structure that may be implemented in digital form, and is suitable for <b>burst</b> <b>transmissions.</b> Index Termsâ€”Frequency-selective channel, nondata-aided esti-mation, oversampling, synchronization.
