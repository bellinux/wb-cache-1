50|$|Binder {{started his}} Grand Prix {{career in the}} 125cc class riding a Aprilia in the 2011 season with his bike number as 14. <b>Binder</b> <b>finished</b> the season {{pointless}} with his best position being a 17th place in Indianapolis.|$|R
50|$|Recycled glass countertops are {{composed}} of 100% recycled glass (post consumer and pre-consumer) in a cement or petroleum based <b>binder.</b> A <b>finished</b> recycled glass countertop often ranges from 70 to 85 percent in recycled content.|$|R
50|$|Binder {{began his}} racing career in karting in 2002, {{remaining}} in the category until 2008. During this time, he {{finished third in the}} German Junior Kart Championship in 2007 and was runner-up in the German Challenger Kart Championship in 2008. In 2009 he began his formula racing career by competing in the ADAC Formel Masters series for the Abt Sportsline team. Whilst his teammate Daniel Abt won the championship, <b>Binder</b> <b>finished</b> the season in seventh position with three podium <b>finishes.</b> <b>Binder</b> then moved up to the German Formula Three Championship: in 2010, he drove for Motopark Academy and finished in twelfth place in the championship, with a best result of third position; 2011 saw him move to the Jo Zeller Racing team, for whom he improved to eighth place despite missing a round of the championship; and for the 2012 season he is driving for the Van Amersfoort Racing team. In 2011 he also competed in one round of the FIA Formula Two Championship, held at the Austrian Red Bull Ring.|$|R
50|$|For 1977, Surtees {{had a new}} driver lineup. Austrian Hans Binder {{drove the}} Durex-sponsored car, and Italian Vittorio Brambilla drove with {{sponsorship}} from Beta. The first race {{of the year was}} the 1977 Argentine Grand Prix; Binder retired with a crash, and Brambilla ran out of fuel five laps from the finish, resulting in a seventh-place finish. Both cars dropped out of the Brazilian Grand Prix, the Italian with an accident and the Austrian with a broken suspension. The South African Grand Prix saw Brambilla <b>finish</b> seventh and <b>Binder</b> 11th. At the United States Grand Prix West, the Austrian finished 11th, and the Italian retired due to a crash. The Spanish Grand Prix saw Brambilla retire after a collision with Clay Regazzoni (Ensign); <b>Binder</b> <b>finished</b> ninth. At the Monaco Grand Prix, the Italian finished eighth, and the Austrian retired with a fuel system failure. Before the Belgian Grand Prix, Binder was dropped and the team hired Australian Larry Perkins, who finished 12th, with Brambilla 4th. The Australian failed to qualify for the Swedish Grand Prix, and the Italian retired with a fuel pressure problem. The French Grand Prix saw Brambilla finish 13th; Perkins was replaced halfway through practice by Frenchman Patrick Tambay, but neither Perkins nor Tambay qualified. For the British Grand Prix, Brambilla finished eighth, with new teammate Australian Vern Schuppan finishing 12th. The German Grand Prix saw the Italian finish fifth and the Australian seventh. At the Austrian Grand Prix, Brambilla finished 15th and Schuppan 16th. Schuppan failed to qualify for the Dutch Grand Prix; the Italian finished 12th. At the Italian Grand Prix, Italian Lamberto Leoni replaced Schuppan but failed to qualify, and Brambilla retired due to a crash. Before the United States Grand Prix East Leoni was replaced by <b>Binder,</b> who <b>finished</b> 11th; Brambilla finished 19th. At the Canadian Grand Prix, Brambilla <b>finished</b> sixth, and <b>Binder</b> crashed. The Japanese Grand Prix saw the Italian finish eighth; the Austrian retired after Mario Andretti's wheel came off his Lotus, causing both Binder and Noritake Takahara (Kojima) to spin out.|$|R
5000|$|The {{final product}} is a {{homogeneous}} nearly 100%-cellulose mass free from any artificial glues, resins, or <b>binders.</b> The <b>finished</b> vulcanized fibre has useful mechanical and electrical properties. It offers high tear and tensile strength, {{while in the}} thinner thicknesses allowing flexibility to conform to curves and bends. In thicker thicknesses, it can be moulded to shape with steam and pressure. One application for vulcanized fibre that attests to its physical strength {{is that it is}} the preferred material for heavy sanding discs. The electrical properties exhibited by vulcanized fibre are high insulating value, and arc and track resistance with service temperature of up to 110 to 120Â°C. Vulcanized fibre shows high resistance to penetration by most organic solvents, oils, and petroleum derivatives ...|$|R
40|$|The work {{focuses on}} a {{comparison}} of petrographic-compositional data between the treatments of some ancient monuments of Tuscany and Sardinia. The purpose is to analyze the differences of surface finishes of various stones and bricks. In fact, the surface finishes can have an original aesthetical and protective function, but they can represent also subsequent treatments to adapt the surface {{to the color of}} the surrounding areas after substitutions or other local interventions. Therefore {{it is important to know}} the type of surface treatment not only for historical-cultural reasons but also to make a more suitable choice of the possibility of remove it. In the surface samples of Tuscany (i. e., Siena Cathedral and Town Hall) and Sardinia (i. e., S. Antioco of Bisarcio and San Geminiano churches) the petrographic analysis, together XRD analyses, of the microsamples revealed the presence of Ca-oxalate which may have originated from organic substances used as <b>binder</b> or <b>finishing...</b>|$|R
50|$|The riders' {{championship}} {{title was}} won by Ajo Motorsport rider Brad Binder, after a second-place finish at the Aragon Grand Prix {{gave him an}} unassailable lead over his title rivals with four races remaining. <b>Binder,</b> who <b>finished</b> {{each of the first}} seven races on the podium, took the championship lead after the second race in Argentina, and took his first Grand Prix victory at the Spanish Grand Prix - starting from 35th on the grid. With four additional wins prior to Aragon, Binder was never headed in the championship thereafter to become South Africa's third world motorcycle racing champion, after Kork Ballington and Jon Ekerold. Binder took two further victories {{before the end of the}} season, in Australia and Valencia, en route to an eventual championship winning margin of 142 points over his next closest competitor. Compared to Binder's seven wins, no other rider was able to take more than two, with eight fellow riders taking at least one win during the 2016 season.|$|R
50|$|Grain fillers {{generally}} {{consist of}} three basic components; a binder, a bulking agent and a solvent. The <b>binder</b> is wood <b>finish,</b> {{and in the}} case of oil-based fillers is typically a blend of oil and varnish. In the case of water-based fillers, it is acrylic or urethane. The type of binder influences the type of solvent used; oil-based fillers usually use mineral spirits, while water-based fillers use water. Both types of filler use silica as a bulking agent as it resists shrinking and swelling in response to changes in temperature and humidity. Other binders may include quartz powder, wood flour, and talc.|$|R
40|$|Gelatine {{may be used}} as a {{film forming}} or as a <b>binder</b> on glazed <b>finishing</b> method. The purpose of this {{research}} is, therefore, to know the appropriate amount of gelatine which is used on finishing to give a satisfactory effect. For this research it was used 9 pieces of crust goat skin. The crusts were then finish varying from 1 percent, 2 percent and 3 percent. It was used Turkish Red Oil in amount of 0, 5 percent. Total solution of the finish should be 100 percent by adding amount of water. In this case water is as a solvent. The crusts were then pad coated, spray coated and top coated with the finish which had been prepared before and were fixed with 10 percent of formalin solution and were glazed. Further more they were tested for the rub fastness using crock metre apparatus. Practical meaning of this research is, the use of gelatine as much as 3 percent in making a finish will give a good. ...|$|R
40|$|Finishing using TiO 2 -nanosol {{treatment}} {{of cellulose acetate}} (CA) fabrics {{before and after the}} latter were pretreated with H 2 O 2 was undertaken with a view to impart unique properties to CA fabrics, notably, self-cleaning. Finishing was performed as per the pad-dry-cure method. The finishing treatment involved dispersing the nano-sized TiO 2 particles in a mixture of water and ethylene glycol (1 : 1) and application of the dispersions to CA fabrics was made under a variety of conditions. Self cleaning ability of the fabrics is favored by 1) increasing the concentration of TiO 2 -nanosol to certain limit; 2) prolongation of curing time up to 15 second; 3) raising the microwave power from 80 % to 100 % but with the certainty that power of 90 % is the most proper. Besides, exposure time-to UV radiation-up to 90 minutes is essential to have remarkable self cleaning properties while keeping other technical properties, namely, strength, roughness and wettability practically unaltered. Incorporation of <b>binder</b> in the <b>finishing</b> pad-bath helps stabilizing the deposition of TiO 2 with excellent self-cleaning. Pre{{treatment of}} CA fabrics with H 2 O 2 is a pre requisite to guarantee excellent self-cleaning ability. Thermofixation and microwave fixation produces fabrics with very comparable technical properties...|$|R
