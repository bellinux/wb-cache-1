5|$|The {{character}} of Ulysses (in Greek, Odysseus) has <b>been</b> <b>explored</b> widely in literature. The adventures of Odysseus were first recorded in Homer's Iliad and Odyssey (c. 800–700 BC), and Tennyson draws on Homer's narrative in the poem. Most critics, however, find that Tennyson's Ulysses recalls Dante's Ulisse in his Inferno (c. 1320). In Dante's re-telling, Ulisse is condemned to hell among the false counsellors, both for {{his pursuit of}} knowledge beyond human bounds and for creating the deception of the Trojan horse.|$|E

Medieval writings {{that deal with}} plague include Giovanni Boccaccio's The Decameron and Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales: both treat the people's fear of contagion and the resulting moral decline, as well as bodily death.|$|E
5|$|Vahan was {{instructed}} by Heraclius {{not to engage}} in battle until all avenues of diplomacy had <b>been</b> <b>explored.</b> This was probably because Yazdegerd III's forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, though their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan's invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, to a similar end. These negotiations delayed the battles for a month.|$|E

Another century passed before the Woodspring Museum from Weston-super-Mare excavated more of Worlebury camp in 1987 to 1988.

Featuring songs by Menken, Ashman, and Tim Rice (who replaced Ashman after his passing) and starring the voice of Robin Williams, Aladdin also established the trend of hiring celebrity actors and actresses to provide the voices of Disney characters, which had <b>been</b> <b>explored</b> to some degree with The Jungle Book and Oliver & Company, but now became standard practice.|$|E
5|$|Birds are a {{significant}} hazard to aircraft, {{but it is difficult}} to keep them away from airfields. Several methods have <b>been</b> <b>explored.</b> Stunning birds by feeding them a bait containing stupefying substances has been tried, and it may be possible to reduce their numbers on airfields by reducing the number of earthworms and other invertebrates by soil treatment. Leaving the grass long on airfields rather than mowing it is also a deterrent to birds. Sonic nets are being trialled; these produce sounds that birds find distracting and seem effective at keeping birds away from affected areas.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{occurred}} during October and November 1998 in the Dallas, Texas area. The producers initially wanted to film in Falls City, Nebraska, where the real-life events had taken place; however, budget constraints meant that principal photography had {{to occur in}} Texas. The film's cinematography uses dim and artificial lighting throughout and was influenced {{by a variety of}} styles, including neorealism and the films of Martin Scorsese, while the soundtrack consisted primarily of country, blues, and rock music from the film. The film's themes, which have <b>been</b> <b>explored</b> by many scholars, include the nature of romantic and platonic relationships, the causes of violence against LGBT people, transgender people and the gender binary, and the relationship among social class, race, and gender.|$|E

5|$|In some instances, the {{automotive}} industry and others were directly responsible for the decline of public transportation. The Great American streetcar scandal saw GM, Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, Phillips Petroleum, Mack Trucks and other companies purchase a number of streetcars and electric trains in the 1930s and 1940s, such that 90percent of city trolleys had been dismantled by 1950. It was argued {{that this was a}} deliberate destruction of streetcars {{as part of a larger}} strategy to push the United States into automobile dependency. In United States v. National City Lines, Inc., many were found guilty of antitrust violations. The story has <b>been</b> <b>explored</b> several times in print, film and other media, for example in Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Taken for a Ride and The End of Suburbia.|$|E
