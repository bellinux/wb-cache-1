5|$|Octopuses bring {{captured}} prey {{back to the}} den {{where they}} can eat it safely. Sometimes the octopus catches more prey than it can eat, and the den is often surrounded by a midden of dead and uneaten food items. Other creatures, such as fish, crabs, molluscs and echinoderms, often share the den with the octopus, either <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> arrived as scavengers, or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> survived capture.|$|E
5|$|Insurers {{claimed that}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{access to and}} collect patient data that allow {{evaluations}} of interventions, they are essential to ACO success. Large insurers formed their own ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices. The increased market share gave them more leverage in negotiations with insurers over costs and reduced patient care options.|$|E
5000|$|Many {{boys were}} placed in {{criminal}} institutions (reformatories, detention centres and work farms) not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> committed any crime, but merely <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> turned 14 and were therefore too old to remain in orphanages.|$|R
2500|$|Clerici vagantes or vagabundi (singular clericus vagans or vagabundus) is {{a medieval}} Latin term meaning [...] "{{wandering}} clergy" [...] applied in early canon law to those clergy {{who led a}} wandering life either <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> no benefice or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> deserted the church to which <b>they</b> <b>had</b> been attached.|$|R
60|$|Quite {{an exodus}} {{took place in}} Dawson in the spring. Men, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made stakes, and other men, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> made none, bought up the {{available}} dogs and rushed out for Dyea over the last ice. Incidentally, {{it was discovered that}} Dave Harney possessed most of these dogs.|$|R

5|$|The Long Valley to Mono Lake {{region is}} one of three areas in California that are in the United States Geological Survey's {{volcanic}} hazards program. These areas are in the program <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> been active in the last 2,000 years and have the ability to produce explosive eruptions.|$|E
5|$|Viruses {{reproduce}} rapidly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{only a few}} genes {{compared to}} humans who have 20,000–25,000. For example, influenza virus has only eight genes and rotavirus has eleven. These genes encode structural proteins that form the virus particle, or non-structural proteins, that are only found in cells infected by the virus.|$|E

5000|$|The {{translator}} of Hagakure, William Scott Wilson observed {{examples of}} warrior emphasis on death in clans other than Yamamoto's: [...] "he (Takeda Shingen) was a strict disciplinarian as a warrior, {{and there is}} an exemplary story in the Hagakure relating his execution of two brawlers, not <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> fought, but <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> not fought to the death".|$|R
5|$|After {{another girl}} goes missing, Cavaldi takes the Grimms and Angelika back to Delatombe. <b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> failed, Cavaldi is ordered to kill both the Grimms; but, after convincing Delatombe that the magic {{in the forest}} is {{actually}} caused by German rebels, he sends them back. While Cavaldi stays behind with Angelika in the village, the brothers attempt {{to get into the}} tower. Jake succeeds and discovers the Queen and the power of her mirror. Meanwhile, another girl, named Sasha, is captured despite Angelika and Cavaldi's efforts to save her.|$|E
5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> {{to carry}} the large water tank and fuel for the burner, snow melting {{machines}} tend to be much larger and heavier than most winter service vehicles, at around , with the largest being hauled by semi-trailer tractor units. In addition, the complicated melting process means that snow melting vehicles have a much lower capacity than the equivalent plow or blower vehicle; the largest snow melter can remove 500 metric tons of snow per hour, compared to the 5,000 metric tons per hour capacity of any large snow blower.|$|E
5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. Bacteria in the guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> no other source of vitamin B.|$|E

50|$|In 1832 the Irish Boroughs {{were given}} a more uniform franchise. In {{addition}} to those who qualified under the previous rules, all occupiers of property worth at least £10 and resident freemen by birth or servitude became electors. The freemen were members of trade guilds, either <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> inherited membership or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>had</b> served an apprenticeship to become members.|$|R

5|$|Descartes' famous {{argument}} for this position {{can be summarized}} as follows: Seth has a clear and distinct idea of his mind as a thinking thing that has no spatial extension (i.e., it cannot be {{measured in terms of}} length, weight, height, and so on). He also has a clear and distinct idea of his body as something that is spatially extended, subject to quantification and not able to think. It follows that mind and body are not identical <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> radically different properties.|$|E
5|$|Eris {{was never}} officially {{classified}} as a planet, and the 2006 definition of planet defined both Eris and Pluto not as planets but as dwarf planets <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> not cleared their neighbourhoods. They do not orbit the Sun alone, {{but as part of}} a population of similarly sized objects. Pluto itself is now recognized as {{being a member of the}} Kuiper belt and the largest dwarf planet, larger than the more-massive Eris.|$|E
5|$|Global warming {{represents}} a future threat by changing habitat. Reptiles are more unsafe than birds <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> less {{ability to move}} large distances. Gibbons and colleagues do not describe any examples of impact on specific state reptile species, although they mention a general concern for turtles and crocodillians having their populations become imbalanced—the animals sexes are determined by temperature of the eggs.|$|E

5|$|Important {{sexual health}} issues for women include Sexually {{transmitted}} infections (STIs) and {{female genital cutting}} (FGC). STIs are a global health priority <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> serious consequences for women and infants. Mother-to-child transmission of STIs can lead to stillbirths, neonatal death, low-birth-weight and prematurity, sepsis, pneumonia, neonatal conjunctivitis, and congenital deformities. Syphilis in pregnancy results in over 300,000 fetal and neonatal deaths per year, and 215,000 infants with {{an increased risk of}} death from prematurity, low-birth-weight or congenital disease.|$|E
5|$|Jesus for President: Politics for Ordinary Radicals is a 2008 book co-written by Evangelical authors Shane Claiborne and Chris Haw, two {{important}} figures in New Monasticism. The book {{asserts that the}} countercultural themes in the ministry of Jesus, {{such as those of}} self-denial, are ignored by American Christians <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> become accustomed to exercising Christian privilege and are unwilling to give it up.|$|E

5|$|The wasps {{preferentially}} {{hunt for}} female cicadas <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> more consumable tissue, but male cicadas {{are easier to}} locate, which explains the systemic bias towards male kills. They chiefly hunt for Tibicen duryi, Tibicen dealbata and Tibicen parallela. Cicada killers are capable of thermoregulation, which allows them to hunt for cicadas during the day, when the cicadas are most prominent. The species is mostly harmless to humans. Some males when emerging early fly into the trees to feed on sap, and the species {{has been known to}} feed on nectar.|$|E
5|$|According to {{traditional}} gender roles in Malawi, men operate {{primarily in the}} formal work sector and are responsible for supporting their families through paid labor, whereas women, who are valued for their domestic skills, are responsible for agricultural labor and care work; this gender-based division of labor decreases women's autonomy, thereby increasing their vulnerability to HIV/AIDS. Even within the home, women often lack bargaining power <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> limited access to education, formal employment, and other resources that could give {{them a sense of}} financial and personal independence. Women who are able to work in the formal sector typically earn significantly less money than men, even when they are completing the same tasks, making {{it difficult for them to}} elevate their status.|$|E
5|$|At the airport, Jai is {{overwhelmed}} with guilt and asks Sahil to leave, {{to which he}} protests. Jai refutes his advances to reconcile, and tells him that they can never be together <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> vastly different lives. They part ways as a heartbroken Sahil watches him leave. As he is walking away into the airport, Jai sends a text message to Sahil saying that he loves him. Alex arrives at the airport to pick Sahil up, much to his surprise. He tries {{to make up for}} his mistakes by offering Sahil a heartfelt apology as the two drive back to their apartment.|$|E
