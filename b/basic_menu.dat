On December 26, 2009, an open beta (version 0.1.0) was released via BitTorrent and other distribution methods. Because the project changes the play-style and feel of the game it is originally based on (Crysis and Crysis Warhead) so completely as to be unrecognizable in comparison, it is billed as a [...] "full-conversion" [...] mod, since little to no trace of the original game's art or play-style (besides the most <b>basic</b> <b>menus</b> seen when first loading the game) exists any longer within MW:LL.|$|R
5000|$|As {{well as the}} Xbox 360 and PS3 versions, IGN also {{reviewed}} the PS2, PSP, Wii, Nintendo DS and iPhone versions. Greg Miller gave the PS2 and Wii versions 8 out 10, praising the gameplay and additional content featured in the PS2 version as well as calling the Wii version the best game of the series on that console. However, Miller criticized the lack of online support on the Wii and commented that the tweaks to the game didn't [...] "play as well on the PSP as they played on the PS3" [...] and that the [...] "whole experience still feels stiff". Reviewer Mark Bozon also commented on the Wii version, calling the switch to buttons a [...] "win/lose situation", with the sacrifice of the Wii-exclusive features in the previous two games has helped the core game get stronger, of which he approved. On the Nintendo DS version, Bozon mentioned that while the game was sluggish in gameplay and that superstars movesets were lacking in areas, the switch to button controls [...] "paid off" [...] and it was [...] "closer to the No Mercy system than ever before". However, Miller gave the iPhone version a score of 2.5 out of 10 and called it [...] "a pretty shallow experience filled with <b>basic</b> <b>menus</b> and ugly visuals.

5000|$|Magic Knight is a {{computer}} game character created by freelance programmer David Jones in his 1985 game Finders Keepers for the Mastertronic budget label. Finders Keepers is a flip-screen platform game released on the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC, MSX and Commodore 64. The game spawned three more ambitious sequels (also starring Magic Knight) on the Mastertronic Added Dimension budget label: Spellbound (1985), Knight Tyme (1986) and Stormbringer (1987). The three sequels are far less action-orientated, being effectively graphic adventure games that use a <b>basic</b> <b>menu</b> system (dubbed [...] "Windimation") to interact with characters and items instead of typed commands.|$|E

5000|$|In {{keeping with}} {{its role as}} an {{application}} framework, MacApp also included a number of pre-rolled objects covering most of the <b>basic</b> Mac GUI—windows, <b>menus,</b> dialogs and similar widgets were all represented within the system. Unfortunately, Apple typically supplied lightweight wrappers over existing internal Mac OS code instead of providing systems that were usable in the [...] "real world". For instance, the TTEView class was offered as the standard text editor, but the underlying TextEdit implementation was severely limited and Apple itself often stated {{it should not be}} used at all after the MLTE control was introduced. As a result, developers were often forced to buy add-on objects to address these sorts of needs, or roll their own. The lack of a set of professional quality GUI objects can be considered one of MacApp's biggest problems.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} a {{methodological approach}} {{for use by}} FAO to collect, analyze and monitor agricultural policy indicators (API) for developing countries. The aim {{is to establish a}} consistent and comparable set of policy indicators, allowing analysts to examine whether agriculture in particular countries is being stimulated or retarded by the set of policies employed. The API should also be useful in the context of quantitative models of policy impacts and market projections. Ideally, the indicators should function as building blocks for the more comprehensive policy measurement. This paper is presented in four parts. Part I gives an overview of the rationale for monitoring, the relationship between policy monitoring, quantitative modeling and evaluation, and the <b>basic</b> <b>menu</b> of choices of indicators. Part II provides a brief review of the studies that have calculated the extent of agricultural support in developed countries since 1973 and of the comparable exercises that have focused on developing countries, mainly published since 1990. In light of the apparent "success" or "failure" of the studies mentioned above, and of the authors' experience with many of them, Part III identifies several areas that in our opinion deserve special attention in the planning of the FAO-sponsored studies. We attempt to provide insights into methodological, computational and logistical problems that might be faced by FAO. Part IV suggests a methodological approach for FAO, elaborating on the suggested coverage, definitions, classification criteria and methods of calculation.

40|$|Background Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a {{disorder}} recognized by underweight and psychiatric symptoms, and some patients {{are at risk}} of developing refeeding syndrome (RFS). AN patients may experience metabolic disturbances and severe symptoms during refeeding, and international guidelines in how to refeed AN patients at risk of RFS varies. The regional departments of eating disorders (EDs) in Norway treat about 100 - 200 patients every year with AN, and a survey investigating procedures have not been performed before. Aim This master thesis has investigated how physicians and registered dietitians (RDs) in the departments of EDs in Norway consider RFS, and how they refeed and monitor patients with AN. Due to the complications and problems that may occur during refeeding in high-risk groups like AN, it was of interest to investigate if procedures, knowledge and awareness varied between the ED units and if the basic reference menu at RASP contain the energy and micronutrients that is recommended for AN patients during refeeding. Method Procedures, questionnaires and analysis of the basic reference menu at RASP have been collected and analyzed. The procedures were collected by contacting the head physicians at the different regional departments of EDs by mail. The master student designed the questionnaire, with assistance from the RDs and supervisor at RASP. The four-week rollover dinner menu at RASP was weighed, photographed and nutritional content calculated. The average nutrient content of the dinners was analyzed together with the other meals (breakfast, lunch, and evening meal) in the basic menu/ and half of the <b>basic</b> <b>menu</b> to evaluate the yield of important nutrients trough one day. Results Three out of six regional departments of EDs have a procedure to identify and/or treat patients at risk of RFS. Initial refeeding range of energy in the procedures varied between 10 - 30 kcal/kg/body weight, or half dietary lists (1000 - 1500 kcal). RFS is a rare syndrome in the ED III units. Only one clinician at one of the ED units had ever seen a patient with full-blown RFS. The basic reference menu at RASP covers the recommendations of most nutrients. Half basic reference menu contains more energy than most international guidelines recommended for patients at risk of RFS. The energy contents in dinner portions in the basic reference menu contain an average of about 480 kcal. Conclusion The procedures of RFS vary between the regional departments of EDs in Norway. A closer collaboration between the units may be favorable, and all units ought to have procedures to identify and treat patients at risk of RFS. The knowledge and awareness of RFS among physicians and RDs working at an ED unit in Norway are good. However, the questionnaire detected that there are some uncertainties both among the physicians and RDs about the definition of RFS. The energy prescribed in Halv grunnmeny" is higher than most of the international guidelines for initial refeeding of patients at risk of RFS. The basic reference menu makes an important frame for and is a good guidance for the milieu therapists that serve the patients during the nutritional rehabilitation at RASP. Supplementation of omega 3, vitamin D and iron should be assessed...|$|E
3000|$|Given a <b>menu</b> of <b>basic</b> {{contracts}} (q̃, t̃), the buyer’s profit {{when the}} farmer declares {{a type of}} θ̂ is p q̃ (θ̂) - t̃ (θ̂). Thus, the buyer’s problem is to choose the contract menu (q̃, t̃) that maximizes ∑ _i ∈{ℓ, h}{ϕ ^i (p q̃ (θ ^i) - t̃ (θ ^i) [...])} subject to incentive and participation constraints. Because the principal’s problem {{when there is a}} basic contract is the same as one with a single composite input, we can characterize the optimal <b>basic</b> contract <b>menu</b> by drawing on standard results from the mechanism design literature in which production {{is a function of the}} farmer’s effort: the constraints that are binding on the buyer are type h’s incentive compatibility constraint and type ℓ’s individual rationality constraint. Consequently, h and ℓ produce, respectively, at and below the symmetric information benchmark solution levels for their types. Moreover, the difference between the transfer offered to ℓ and ℓ’s production cost of delivering the designated output level will just equal ℓ’s reservation utility, which in our model is zero. On the other hand, the transfer offered to h includes a premium, referred to as his information rent, which in the optimal contract will just offset the increment in utility that h would derive by adopting ℓ’s contract rather than the one intended for him. Remark 3 summarizes the textbook treatment of this class of contract (see, e.g., Varian 1992, pp. 457 – 463).|$|R
