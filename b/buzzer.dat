5|$|These trains {{originally}} had no visual passenger information systems; station announcements {{had to be}} made by the train operator. An automatic audio announcement system using voice synthesizers was installed on each train by September 1994.

5|$|Civilian {{telephones}} {{were used}} {{at the outset of}} the war, but they were found to be unreliable in the damp, muddy conditions that prevailed. Consequently, the field telephone was designed; a device that operated with its own switchboard. Apart from voice communication, it featured a <b>buzzer</b> unit with a Morse code key, so that it could be used to send and receive coded messages. This facility proved useful when, in the midst of bombardment, exploding shells drowned out voice communication. The telephones were connected by lines that sustained continual damage as a result of shell fire and the movement of troops. The lines were generally buried, with redundant lines set in place to compensate for breakages.|$|E
5|$|The Jeopardy! staff used {{different}} {{means to}} notify Watson {{and the human}} players when to buzz, which was critical in many rounds. The humans were notified by a light, which took them tenths of a second to perceive. Watson was notified by an electronic signal and could activate the <b>buzzer</b> within about eight milliseconds. The humans tried {{to compensate for the}} perception delay by anticipating the light, but the variation in the anticipation time was generally too great to fall within Watson's response time. Watson did not attempt to anticipate the notification signal.|$|E
5|$|Watson's basic working {{principle}} is to parse keywords in a clue while searching for related terms as responses. This gives Watson some {{advantages and disadvantages}} compared with human Jeopardy! players. Watson has deficiencies in understanding the contexts of the clues. As a result, human players usually generate responses faster than Watson, especially to short clues. Watson's programming prevents it from using the popular tactic of buzzing before it is sure of its response. Watson has consistently better reaction time on the <b>buzzer</b> once it has generated a response, and is immune to human players' psychological tactics, such as jumping between categories on every clue.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s, the <b>Buzzers</b> {{established}} {{themselves in}} the Metro Junior B Hockey League. In 1961, the <b>Buzzers</b> defeated the Big 10's Owen Sound Greys 4-games-to-none to win the Sutherland Cup. They sat from 1961 to 1963 as their parent club, the Toronto St. Michael's Majors, struggled financially. In 1966-67 the team again took a one-year leave of absence. Despite this, the <b>Buzzers</b> played during the glory years of the Metro league. In 1972, the Ontario Provincial Junior A Hockey League was formed and raided the league for all but four of its charter members, of which one of these teams folded. A season later, the OPJHL also took the Markham Waxers leaving the Metro league with only the <b>Buzzers</b> and Toronto Nationals as the league's original blood. By 1980, the Nationals had folded and had left the <b>Buzzers</b> as the only team left in a twelve team league that pre-dated the 1972 realignment.|$|R

Ginóbili {{is a member of}} the senior Argentine national basketball team, and made his senior debut during the 1998 FIBA World Championship in Athens. He also played at the 2002 FIBA World Championship, where he won a silver medal. His best accomplishment as a member of the national team came at the 2004 Athens Summer Olympics when Argentina became the first team other than Team USA to win the gold medal in 16 years. The highlight of the tournament was his game-winning <b>buzzer</b> beater with 0.7 seconds remaining, on the opening day of the Olympics, in a game versus Serbia and Montenegro. Ginóbili led the team in both scoring (19.3 points per game) and assists (3.3 assists per game).|$|E

Mikan again was dominant, averaging 27.4 points per game and 2.9 assists per game and taking another scoring title; Alex Groza of Indianapolis Olympians {{was the only other}} player to break the 20-point-barrier that year. After comfortably leading his team to an impressive 51–17 record and storming through the playoffs, Mikan's team played the 1950 NBA Finals against the Syracuse Nationals. In Game 1, the Lakers beat Syracuse on their home court when Lakers reserve guard Bob Harrison hit a 40-foot <b>buzzer</b> beater to give Minneapolis a two-point win. The team split the next four games, and in Game 6, the Lakers won 110–95 and won the first-ever NBA championship. Mikan scored 31.3 points per game in the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|Nowitzki {{began playing}} for the German {{national}} basketball team in 1997. In his debut tournament, the EuroBasket 1999, the 21-year-old rookie emerged as the main German scorer, but Germany finished seventh and failed {{to qualify for the}} 2000 Olympic Games. In the EuroBasket 2001, Nowitzki was top scorer with 28.7 points per game, and narrowly lost the MVP vote to Serbian player Peja Stojaković. Germany reached the semifinals and were close to beating host nation Turkey, but Hedo Türkoğlu hit a 3-point <b>buzzer</b> beater to tie it, and the Turks eventually won in overtime. Germany then lost 99–90 against Spain, and did not win a medal. However, with averages of 28.7 points and 9.1 rebounds, Nowitzki led the tournament in both statistics, and was voted to the All-Star team. Back home, the German basketball team attracted up to 3.7 million television viewers, a German basketball record at the time.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, Michigan lost to Northwestern 65–67, {{following}} a <b>buzzer</b> beater layup from Dererk Pardon. Michigan {{was led by}} Walton with a team-high 15 points. On March 5, Michigan handed Nebraska its worst loss in program history (36-point margin) and set a record for opposition points scored (93) in Pinnacle Bank Arena in the final regular season contest of the year. Walton posted his fourth double-double {{of the season with}} a game-high 18 points, and set a Michigan single-game record with 16 assists, surpassing Gary Grant.

5|$|With Taurasi {{joining the}} core of the 2000 Championship team, Auriemma {{confidently}} predicted another championship in 2001, but the season {{turned out to be more}} difficult than expected. UConn won the Big East Tournament over Notre Dame in a game remembered for the Bird at the <b>Buzzer</b> shot, but lost key players Abrosimova and Ralph to season-ending injuries. As a consequence, Taurasi had to play a much larger role than anticipated in the NCAA Tournament. She led UConn to the Final Four, but in the national semifinals against Notre Dame in St. Louis, Taurasi had a poor shooting game, and despite UConn having attained a 16-point lead at one point, the team lost. Notre Dame went on to win its first National Championship.|$|E

5|$|At 1:24a.m., {{one of the}} two men outside {{pushed the}} <b>buzzer</b> near the door and told Abath they were policemen who heard of a {{disturbance}} in the courtyard, and requested to be let inside. Abath knew he should not let uninvited guests inside, but he was unsure on whether the rule applied to police officers. He could see the men and believed them to be police officers based on their uniforms. With his partner on patrol, Abath decided to buzz in the men. When the intruders arrived at the main security desk, one of them told Abath that he looked familiar and there was a default warrant out for his arrest. Abath stepped out from behind his desk, where the only alarm button to alert police could be accessed. He was quickly asked for his ID, ordered to face the wall, and then handcuffed. Abath believed the arrest was a misunderstanding, until he realized he hadn't been frisked before being cuffed, and one officer's mustache was made of wax. The second security guard arrived minutes later and was also handcuffed, after which he asked the intruders why he was being arrested. The thieves explained that they were not being arrested, but rather this was a robbery, and proceeded to take the guards to the museum's basement. They handcuffed the guards to pipes and wrapped duct tape around their hands, feet, and heads.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2003–04 season began, the Spurs {{lost their}} {{perennial}} captain David Robinson to retirement. Embracing the lone team leader role, Duncan led a reformed Spurs team which included Slovenian center Rasho Nesterovič, defensive stalwart Bruce Bowen, Argentinian shooting guard Ginóbili and young French point guard Parker. Coming {{off the bench}} were clutch shooting power forward Robert Horry, versatile Hedo Türkoğlu and veterans Malik Rose and Kevin Willis. In retrospect, Robinson commented that at first, Duncan was reluctant {{to step into the}} void, still needing some time to truly develop his leadership skills. Statistically though, Duncan remained strong; after another convincing season with averages of 22.3 points, 12.4 rebounds, 3.1 assists and 2.7 blocks, he led the Spurs into the Western Conference Semifinals. There, they met the Los Angeles Lakers again, split the series 2–2, and in Game 5, Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot which put the Spurs ahead by one point with 0.4 seconds left to play. Despite the little time remaining, Lakers point guard Derek Fisher hit a <b>buzzer</b> beater for an upset Lakers win. In the end, the Spurs lost the series 4–2, and Duncan attributed the strong Lakers defense as {{one of the reasons for}} the loss.|$|E
5|$|In January of the 2014–15 season, James missed {{two weeks}} due to left knee {{and lower back}} strains, the longest stretch of missed games in his career. In total, he played a career-low 69 games and his final averages were 25.3 points, 6 rebounds, and 7.4 assists per game. In {{the second round of}} the playoffs, he hit a {{baseline}} jumper at the <b>buzzer</b> to give Cleveland a 2–2 series tie with the Bulls. In the Conference Finals, the Cavaliers defeated the Hawks to advance to the Finals, making James the first player since the 1960s to play in five consecutive Finals. For most of the Finals against the Golden State Warriors, Irving and Love were sidelined due to injury, giving James more offensive responsibilities. Behind his leadership, the Cavaliers opened the series with a 2–1 lead before being eliminated in six games. Despite the loss, he received serious consideration for the Finals MVP Award, averaging 35.8 points, 13.3 rebounds, and 8.8 assists per game for the championship round.|$|E
