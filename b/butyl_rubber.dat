50|$|The {{mechanical}} components in typical speaker drivers may change over time. Paper, a popular material in cone fabrication, absorbs moisture easily and unless treated may lose some structural rigidity over time. This {{may be reduced}} by coating with water-impregnable material such as various plastic resins. Cracks compromise structural rigidity and if large enough are generally non-repairable. Temperature has a strong, generally reversible effect; typical suspension materials become stiffer at lower temperatures. The suspension experiences fatigue, and also undergoes changes from chemical and environmental effects associated with aging such as exposure to ultraviolet light, and oxidation which affect foam and natural rubber components badly, though <b>butyl,</b> nitrile, SBR <b>rubber,</b> and rubber-plastic alloys (such as Santoprene) are more stable. The polyester type of polyurethane foam is highly prone to disintegration after 10 to 15 years. The changes in behavior from aging may often be positive, though since the environment that they are used in {{is a major factor}} the effects are not easily predicted. Gilbert Briggs, founder of Wharfedale Loudspeakers in the UK, undertook several studies of aging effects in speaker drivers in the 1950s and 1960s, publishing some of the data in his books, notably Loudspeakers.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was the {{development}} of screening methods for the identification and quantification of plastic additives, their degradation products, residual solvents and degrada-tion products of the polymer materials. After having done comprehensive researches on the subject in literature and communication with different manufacturers of plastics and elastom-ers an overview was compiled about commonly used plastic additives and additionally degra-dation products and residual solvents which often migrate. For volatile extractables and leach-ables a HS-GC-FID was developed and for semi volatile components the GC-MS with direct injection was used. The HPLC-UV and the UPLC-UV-MS were applied for the determination of non volatile compounds. With these screening methods 64 potential extractables like anti-oxidants, UV stabilizers, plasticizers, lubricants, silicone derivates or residual solvents could be identified. By means of selected substances which represented {{a broad range of}} chemical and physical properties it could be shown that these methods are amenable to validation. Solely the contrast medium led to difficulties during validation of the HPLC-UV method caused by the highly concentrated radio-opaque substance which results in overloading of the column. An optimized sample preparation shall avoid these effects. Extraction with non polar solvents could be an opportunity. Additionally extraction methods for the investigation of different plastic and elastomers con-cerning their extractable profiles after extraction with water, isopropanol and hexane were developed. The plastic additives Irganox 1010, BHT, Irganox 1076, MTBC, DEHP, stearic acid, sulphur, as well as residual solvents and degradation products like different tertiary alco-hols (p. a. t-butanole), 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanole, various hydrocarbons (p. a. dodecane, tetradecane, eicosane, tetracosane), Irgafos 168 oxide, palmitic-, myristic acid, benzyls and silicone deri-vates were the commonly extracted substances. These extractable profiles serve as an essential basis for assessing the suitability of materials as primary packaging materials during the development of new container closure systems. Thus COP, COC, PC and PP as plastics and the chlorinated <b>butyl</b> <b>rubbers</b> C and D would be appropriated. The extractable profiles of these materials are least comprehensive. Among these properties additional factors are important during the development of packaging, p. a. process ability and barrier properties. A compromise between these claims shall be identified. Afterwards one’s own hand assembled devices, filled with water or rather contrast medium, was investigated concerning their migration profiles. These devices (cartridges and vials with different composition) were being stored at 40 °C and 75 % relatively humidity for six months. After sterilization, tri- and the storage for six month the devices were investigated with the developed analytical methods. T-butanole, BHT, m-Xylene, o-Xylene, Ethylbenzene and silicone derivates were migrated compounds. With the help of statutory provisions the toxicological assessment didn`t show any health haz-ard neither for water nor for contrast medium as filling. For the assessment of migrated un-known substances the Kunststoffrichtlinie 2002 / 72 /EG was used. According to FDA using regulations from the food sector is possible. Concentrations of known leachables as well as the global migration limits, summarizing concentrations of known and unknown substances were not exceeded. The toxicological risk was estimated being harmless. For unknown sub-stances identification should be conducted to exclude any toxicological risk if a registration as primary packaging material is targeted. When comparing extractable and leachable profiles in many cases a similar screen was shown concerning known compounds. However a quantitative correlation couldn’t be demonstrated. The reason was the use of different moulded articles. The different moulding processes caused an allocation of plastic additives in plastics and elastomers which wasn’t comparable. Within the scope of this work screening methods to investigate plastics and elastomers con-cerning their extractable and leachable profiles has been developed successfully. It is possible to select materials already during the development process considering the potential of migra-tion of the used plastic additives. The following toxicological assessment allows an early de-cision about the suitability as primary packaging material. Caused by the multiplicity of plas-tic additives which are currently on the market and their possibility to create reaction products with the filling it is necessary to adapt or amend the developed methods...|$|R

40|$|A {{program for}} {{evaluating}} packaging components {{that may be}} used in transporting mixed-waste forms has been developed and the first phase has been completed. This effort involved the screening of ten plastic materials in four simulant mixed-waste types. These plastics were butadiene-acrylonitrile copolymer rubber, cross-linked polyethylene (XLPE), epichlorohydrin rubber, ethylene-propylene rubber (EPDM), fluorocarbon (Viton or Kel-F), polytetrafluoroethylene, high-density polyethylene (HDPE), isobutylene-isoprene copolymer <b>rubber</b> (<b>butyl),</b> polypropylene, and styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR). The selected simulant mixed wastes were (1) an aqueous alkaline mixture of sodium nitrate and sodium nitrite; (2) a chlorinated hydrocarbon mixture; (3) a simulant liquid scintillation fluid; and (4) a mixture of ketones. The testing protocol involved exposing the respective materials to 286, 000 rads of gamma radiation followed by 14 -day exposures to the waste types at 60 {degrees}C. The seal materials were tested using vapor transport rate (VTR) measurements while the liner materials were tested using specific gravity as a metric. For these tests, a screening criterion of 0. 9 g/hr/m{sup 2 } for VTR and a specific gravity change of 10 % was used. Based on this work, it was concluded that while all seal materials passed exposure to the aqueous simulant mixed waste, EPDM and SBR had the lowest VTRs. In the chlorinated hydrocarbon simulant mixed waste, only Viton passed the screening tests. In both the simulant scintillation fluid mixed waste and the ketone mixture simulant mixed waste, none of the seal materials met the screening criteria. For specific gravity testing of liner materials, the data showed that while all materials with the exception of polypropylene passed the screening criteria, Kel-F, HDPE, and XLPE offered the greatest resistance to the combination of radiation and chemicals...|$|R
40|$|This work employs five {{commercial}} carbon-black filled elastomers {{made from}} ethylene-propylene-diene, nitrile, <b>butyl</b> and natural <b>rubber</b> compounds to study different {{manifestations of the}} stress-softening phenomenon known as the Mullins effect. The structure of the materials was characterised using density, hardness, thermal analysis and microscopy. Cyclic tensile deformations under uniaxial, constant-width and equibiaxial models were used to study the mechanical response following different strain histories. The mechanical response and the energies stored and dissipated were both dependent on the strain history. Elastomers with no strain history exhibited a relatively constant dissipated energy fraction, which reduced to a lower constant fraction when the historical maximum strain was higher than the current maximum strain. A physically based modelling approach with a simple representation {{of the evolution of}} bound rubber was proposed to account for this. The approach was able to qualitatively reproduce the energy maps observed in the experimental data. A set of time-dependent test protocols were developed in both uniaxial and biaxial modes of deformation to investigate the effect of strain history on stress-relaxation and stress-memory following cyclic loading. All filled rubbers relaxed an approximately constant fraction of the stress after a given time when the applied strain during stress relaxation was smaller than the historical maximum. Under these circumstances the relaxed fraction was independent of both the strain history and the current strain, with important implications for scragging. An empirical function involving just five parameters was proposed to predict the fraction of unrelaxed stress for an arbitrary strain history. Stress memory was observed following unloading, with a recovered stress magnitude approximately independent of history. Anisotropy was investigated through linear dimensional swelling measurements. A degree of anisotropy was observed specific to the manufacturing process: compression moulding led to transverse isotropy, while sheet-rolling led to full anisotropy. Following a strain history, the anisotropy was shown to evolve further...|$|R
