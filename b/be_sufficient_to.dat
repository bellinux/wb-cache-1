5|$|At {{a conference}} in September 1906, many of the {{disagreements}} over the ship's design were resolved. The Naval Constructor, von Eickstedt, argued that since the explosive trials for the proposed protection systems for the new battlecruiser had not been completed, the construction should be postponed, to allow for any alterations to the design. He also argued that guns of 21cm(8.3in) or 24cm(9.4in) caliber would <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> penetrate the armor of the new British battlecruisers. However, Admiral August von Heeringen, of the General Navy Department, stated that for the ship {{to be able to}} engage battleships, the 28cm(11in) caliber guns were necessary.|$|E

5|$|Because Triton's surface {{indicates}} {{a long history}} of melting, models of its interior posit that Triton is differentiated, like Earth, into a solid core, a mantle and a crust.

There is enough rock in Triton's interior for radioactive decay to power convection in the mantle to this day.

5|$|Chess {{players and}} theoreticians have long debated whether, given perfect play by both sides, the game should {{end in a}} win for White, or a draw. Since {{approximately}} 1889, when World Champion Wilhelm Steinitz addressed this issue, the overwhelming consensus has been that a perfectly played game would end in a draw. However, a few notable players have argued that White's advantage may <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> force a win: Weaver Adams and Vsevolod Rauzer claimed that White is winning after the first move 1.e4, while Hans Berliner argued that 1.d4 may win for White.|$|E
5|$|Going {{into the}} final round of games, both teams were equal on points with Spain, with Scotland ahead thanks to a {{superior}} goal difference; however, Spain's final game at home to Iceland was scheduled to be played two weeks after Wales and Scotland had played each other.

5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{it was decided}} to upgrade the Røa and Sognsvann Lines to metro standard. This would allow them to use T1000 stock. Twelve T2000 were ordered in 1991, and would <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> operate the {{services}} on the Holmenkollen and Kolsås Lines, that would retain an overhead wire. The development costs for the T2000 were in part subsidized by the government, as the high-tech product from Strømmens Verksted (by then part of the ABB Group) and AEG was seen as a future export product. The trains were delivered in 1994 and taken into use in 1995. The same year, the metro started operating all services through the city center, connecting the western and eastern networks.|$|E
5|$|Lithium {{was first}} {{detected}} in human organs and fetal tissues {{in the late}} 19th century. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, {{as well as with}} growth and transforming factors. Evidence now appears to <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> accept lithium as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000µg/day is suggested for a 70kg adult.|$|E

5|$|Should {{the white}} dwarf's mass {{approach}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 it {{will no longer}} be supported by electron degeneracy pressure and it will undergo a collapse. For a core primarily composed of oxygen, neon and magnesium, the collapsing white dwarf is likely to form a neutron star. In this case, only a fraction of star's mass will be ejected as a result. If the core is instead made of carbon-oxygen, however, increasing pressure and temperature will initiate carbon fusion in the center prior to attainment of the Chandrasekhar limit. The dramatic result is a runaway nuclear fusion reaction that consumes a substantial fraction of the star within a short time. This will <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> unbind the star in a cataclysmic, Type Ia supernova explosion.|$|E
5|$|The LNC {{continued}} to lobby the SR and its 1948 successor British Railways until the 1950s {{on the matter}} of cheap fares for visitors to the cemetery, but were unable to come to any agreement. In 1957 the Southern Region of British Railways considered allowing the LNC to sell discounted fares of 7s6d (compared to the standard rate of 9s4d) for day return tickets from London to Brookwood. By this time most visitors to the cemetery were travelling by road. The LNC felt that the relatively minor difference between the fares would not <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> attract visitors back to the railway, and the proposal was abandoned.|$|E

Sufficient hydrogen was pumped into the gas-bag to enable the airship to ascend to its intended maximum operating altitude of , at which height the ballonet would occupy approximately one-fifth of the total gas-bag volume. Descent was made by releasing hydrogen from the gas-bag and then pumping air into the ballonet to take up the volume of the released gas, a process which was repeated incrementally until the desired rate of descent or altitude had been achieved.|$|E

5|$|The USAAF {{assessed}} {{that the}} firebombing campaign had been highly successful, {{and noted that}} American losses during these attacks were much lower than those incurred during day precision raids. Accordingly, the Joint Target Group (JTG), which was the Washington, D.C.-based organisation responsible for developing strategies for the air campaign against Japan, developed plans for a two-stage campaign against 22 Japanese cities. The JTG also recommended that precision bombing attacks on particularly important industrial facilities continue in parallel to the area raids, however. While this campaign was intended to form part of preparations for the Allied invasion of Japan, LeMay and some members of Arnold's staff believed that it alone would <b>be</b> <b>sufficient</b> <b>to</b> force the country's surrender.|$|E

Aerial interdiction could not succeed unless Hanoi felt the pressure and relented. The seed of the campaign's failure, however, was sown in its first operation.
