40|$|Objective To {{outline the}} pharmacodynamics, {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} <b>besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension 0. 6 % {{in the treatment of}} bacterial conjunctivitis. Quality of Evidence MEDLINE database was searched to review recent pharmacodynamic and clinical studies evaluating <b>besifloxacin</b> and comparing <b>besifloxacin</b> to other topical antibiotics for ophthalmic use. Findings were limited to full-text articles from clinical journals in the English language. Main Message Bacterial resistance is a common source for treatment failure in bacterial conjunctivis. <b>Besifloxacin,</b> a novel fourth generation synthetic fluoroquinolone is likely to show lower resistance rates due to its mechanism of action and its short-term use for ocular infections only (decreased systemic exposure). <b>Besifloxacin</b> displays improved pharmacodynamic properties compared to other commonly used fluoroquinolones and has shown to be efficacious and safe in clinical studies. Conclusion <b>Besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension 0. 6 % provides safe and efficacious treatment for bacterial conjunctivitis. The factors leading to bacterial resistance are diminished, which allows <b>besifloxacin</b> to be a favorable treatment option...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the safety of <b>besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension 0. 6 % as antibacterial prophy-laxis in the surgical setting. Methods: Two prospective safety surveillance studies were con-ducted—one in the cataract surgery setting and the other in the laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) surgery setting. Cases from patients aged 18 years and above were eligible for inclusion. In both surveillance studies, data were collected from consecutive cases of routine primary cataract surgery and LASIK surgery, respectively, in which <b>besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension 0. 6 % or moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0. 5 % was used as the topical perioperative pro-phylactic antibacterial medication as part of the clinician’s routine standard of care. The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). Results: The cataract surgery surveillance study included 485 cases/eyes (<b>besifloxacin,</b> n = 333; moxifloxacin, n = 152), whereas the LASIK surveillance study included 456 cases/eyes (<b>besifloxacin,</b> n = 344; moxifloxacin, n = 112). In the cataract study, only 1 TEAE was reported in a <b>besifloxacin</b> case (mild hypersensitivity/allergic reaction considered possibly related to <b>besifloxacin).</b> No TEAEs were reported in the LASIK study. In both studies, surgical outcomes were similar with both treatments. The frequency of preoperative and/or postoperative dosing was generally lower for <b>besifloxacin</b> than that for moxifloxacin. Conclusions: In prospective safety surveillance studies of patients undergoing cataract extraction or LASIK, TEAEs associated with prophylactic use of <b>besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension 0. 6 % were rare, and surgical outcomes with <b>besifloxacin</b> were similar to those with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution 0. 5 %.

40|$|Objectives: <b>Besifloxacin</b> {{is a new}} {{fluoroquinolone}} {{in development}} for ocular use. We investigated {{its mode of action}} and resistance in two major ocular pathogens, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus, and in the reference species Escherichia coli. Methods: Primary and secondary targets of <b>besifloxacin</b> were evaluated by: (i) mutant selection experi-ments; (ii) MIC testing of defined topoisomerase mutants; and (iii) inhibition and cleavable complex assays with purified S. pneumoniae and E. coli DNA gyrase and topoisomerase IV enzymes. Results: Enzyme assays showed similar <b>besifloxacin</b> activity against S. pneumoniae gyrase and topoi-somerase IV, with IC 50 and CC 25 of 2. 5 and 1 mM, respectively. In contrast to ciprofloxacin and moxi-floxacin, <b>besifloxacin</b> was equally potent against both S. pneumoniae and E. coli gyrases.

Methods: This was a prospective, randomized, laboratory-masked clinical trial. Patients received <b>besifloxacin</b> or moxifloxacin “quater in die” or QID (four times a day) for 3  days before cataract surgery in the surgical eye and 1  hour before surgery in the nonsurgical fellow eye. Conjunctival and eyelid swabs were obtained from both eyes at baseline and after treatment, on the day of surgery (Visit 2). Swabs were processed for bacterial colony counts (in terms of colony-forming units) and species identification. In vitro antibiotic susceptibilities of isolates were determined using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute breakpoints. Results: Fifty-nine patients (n= 28 <b>besifloxacin,</b> n= 31 moxifloxacin) completed the study. The majority (73 %) of conjunctival samples were culture negative at baseline. The most frequent isolates were coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS, 89 %), specifically Staphylococcus epidermidis (72 %). Both fluoroquinolones reduced the lid CFU values when administered QID for 3  days (P≤ 0. 019), but only <b>besifloxacin</b> reduced the lid CFU estimate 1 hour following instillation of a single drop (P= 0. 039).

This {{study was conducted to}} determine the contribution of the R 7 and R 8 substituent to fluoroquinolone antibacterial activity. Materials and methods: <b>Besifloxacin,</b> moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, their R 8 structural analogs, and ciprofloxacin were tested against representative isolates of various gram-positive and gram-negative species and previously characterized fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants of Staphylococcus aureus. Minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentrations were determined according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Reserpine was used to determine the effect of efflux pumps on antibacterial activity. Results: In general, exchanging the R 8 residue in <b>besifloxacin</b> slightly reduced the molecule&# 39;s potency, while introducing an 8 -chloro group in moxifloxacin increased its potency. A similar change in gatifloxacin had little to no effect. Substituting the R 8 residues did not increase the susceptibility to the efflux pump inhibitor reserpine or result in a loss of bactericidal activity. In contrast, the positive control, ciprofloxacin, was shown to be a substrate for reserpine and lost bactericidal activity against some fluoroquinolone-resistant isolates of S. aureus. Conclusion: The data presented here show that, depending on the R 7 substituent, replacing an 8 -methoxy group with an 8 -chloro substituent can improve potency or can have little-to-no effect. These findings highlight the importance of the interplay between the R 7 and R 8 substituents in determining antibacterial potency.

Methods: This prospective, two-site, parallel-group, investigator-masked clinical study included patients aged &ge; 18 years scheduled to undergo phacoemulsification with intraocular lens implantation. Patients received one drop of either <b>besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension or moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution four times daily, beginning 3 days prior to surgery, which was continued for 7 days postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of adverse events. Secondary endpoints included endothelial cell count, central corneal thickness, and overall and central corneal staining measured on days 7 (&plusmn; 1 day) and 28 (&plusmn; 2 days) following surgery, and intraocular pressure and best-corrected visual acuity measured on days 1, 7 (&plusmn; 1 day), and 28 (&plusmn; 2 days) following surgery. Results: Of the 60 patients enrolled, 58 (29 per treatment group) completed the study. No adverse events were reported in either treatment group. Changes in the central corneal thickness, endothelial cell count, and corneal staining were small and similar between treatments at follow-up visits (P &ge; 0. 1549). Intraocular pressure was similar between treatment groups at each visit, as was the distribution of best-corrected visual acuity. The final best-corrected visual acuity was 20 / 30 or better in 85 % of the patients. Conclusion: In this study, <b>besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension 0. 6 % was well tolerated when used prophylactically to prevent postoperative endophthalmitis following sutureless cataract surgery.

Methods: Clinical microbiological eradication data from three randomized, double-masked, parallel group studies of patients with bacterial conjunctivitis (two vehicle controlled; one active controlled with moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution, 0. 5 %) were integrated. All bacterial samples isolated at baseline above the species-specific threshold value were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Samples isolated at subsequent visits were subjected to susceptibility testing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) to investigate the cause of eradication failures and the potential for drug resistance development. Results: Visit 2 (day 4 or 5) and visit 3 (day 8) overall microbiological eradication rates were 92. 2 % and 88. 4 % for <b>besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension compared with 61. 4 % and 72. 5 % for vehicle and 91. 6 % and 85. 7 % for moxifloxacin ophthalmic solution. Visit 2 and visit 3 microbiological eradication rates for Gram-positive and Gram-negative isolates and for individual species were consistent with the overall eradication rates. The majority of observed eradication failures in any treatment group were due to the persistence of the pathogen isolated at baseline. Eradication failures in the <b>besifloxacin</b> treatment group were not associated with lower antimicrobial susceptibility at baseline. PFGE data showed that the majority of bacterial strains in eyes with eradication failures were identical to the strain isolated at baseline; these eradication failures were not associated with a lower antimicrobial susceptibility at the follow-up visit. Conclusion: Treatment with <b>besifloxacin</b> ophthalmic suspension, 0. 6 %, administered TID for 5 days resulted in microbiological eradication rates that were &ge; 90 % across the three clinical studies for the common pathogens of bacterial conjunctivitis. The few eradication failures were not due to fluoroquinolone resistance at baseline and/or resistance development during treatment.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{describe}} the demographics, characteristics, {{and treatment of}} giant fornix syndrome, a rare cause of chronic purulent conjunctivitis in the elderly. METHODS: Retrospective chart review of five patients with giant fornix syndrome evaluated by the Cornea Service, Oculoplastics and Orbital Surgery Service and the Department of Pathology at the Wills Eye Institute. RESULTS: The median age of the 5 female patients was 75 years (mean 80, range 70 - 95). The median duration of eye symptoms before presentation was 2 years (mean 2. 4, range 1 - 4). Before referral, the chronic conjunctivitis was treated with topical antibiotics in all 5 cases and with additional dacryocystorhinostomy in one case. The right eye was affected in 2 cases, and the left eye was affected in the other 3 cases. Floppy eyelids were present in 2 cases. The superior fornix was involved in 4 cases, and the inferior fornix was involved in one case. Pseudomembranes and superficial punctate keratitis (SPK) were seen in 3 cases. Diagnosis of giant fornix syndrome was made in all 5 cases. Conjunctival culture grew methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and S. aureus in singular cases. Case 1 was treated with topical moxifloxacin, Case 2 was treated with topical vancomycin and repair of the upper eyelid, Case 3 was treated with topical <b>besifloxacin,</b> and Case 4 was treated with dacryocystorhinostomy and topical vancomycin. Case 5 was treated with reconstruction of the left upper eyelid. The median duration of follow up was 4 months (mean 21. 6, range 1 - 84). CONCLUSIONS: Giant fornix syndrome can lead to chronic relapsing conjunctivitis in the elderly. Deep conjunctival fornices in affected patients can be a site for prolonged sequestration of bacteria causing recurrent infections. Removing the infected debris from the superior fornix and reconstruction of the upper eyelid may prevent the recurrent chronic persistent infection...|$|E
