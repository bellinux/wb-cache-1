5|$|Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa) are {{harvested}} from an estimated 250,000400,000 trees per year. Highly valued edible nut {{used in the}} confectionery and <b>baking</b> trades. Excellent dietary source of selenium.|$|E
5|$|Burger King cooks its {{foods in}} one of four ways: broiling, deep frying, <b>baking,</b> or microwaving. As noted in its mottos and advertisements, BK cooks its burgers and grilled chicken on an {{automated}} grill, while its other chicken products, fish, sides, and breakfast sausage are deep-fried in vegetable oil. BK prepares its biscuits, cinnamon rolls, and cookies by <b>baking</b> in a convection oven and microwaves its BK Veggie burger patty.|$|E
5|$|Pecans (Carya illinoinensis) are {{the only}} major nut tree native to North America. Pecans are eaten as a snack food, and used as an {{ingredient}} in <b>baking</b> and other food preparation.|$|E
5|$|Primary {{ingredients}} in an old-fashioned doughnut include flour, sugar, eggs, sour cream or buttermilk, and leavening agents such as <b>baking</b> powder or <b>baking</b> soda. Additional ingredients may include milk, butter, vanilla extract and salt. The use of buttermilk or sour cream may impart a rich flavor to the doughnut. It is typically deep-fried, {{and may be}} deep fried at a lower temperature compared to other doughnut styles, having a crunchier texture compared to other cake doughnut styles. Frying at a lower temperature contributes to its rough, cracked texture. Being turned several times while cooking in the oil also contributes to its texture.|$|E
5|$|Schulze <b>Baking</b> Company Plant is {{a factory}} {{building}} {{located on the}} South Side of Chicago, Illinois, United States. It is located at 40 East Garfield Boulevard (also described as 55th Street and Wabash Avenue) in the Washington Park community area in Cook County. Built in 1914, the building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 12, 1982. Originally built for the Schulze <b>Baking</b> Company, it was {{the home of the}} Hostess Brands' Butternut Bread until 2004.|$|E
5|$|Schulze, {{with its}} {{signature}} Butternut Bread, eventually became Interstate Bakeries Corporation/Hostess Brands. The business was once Chicago's largest wholesale business entity. Although, according to Form 10-K filings by the Interstate Bakeries Corporation with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, the Schulze <b>Baking</b> Company was not formed until 1927, many records contradict this claim. Historical accounts of Chicago claim that Paul Schulze, 1910-11 {{president of the}} National Association of Master Bakers, started the Schulze <b>Baking</b> Company in 1893 with his brothers. Interstate's own company history even confirms the 1893 beginning of Schulze.|$|E
5|$|Screened sugars are {{crystalline}} products separated {{according to}} the size of the grains. They are used for decorative table sugars, for blending in dry mixes and in <b>baking</b> and confectionery.|$|E
5|$|The Banginis and Rimi Hypermarket, {{located in}} Šiaurės miestelis, are among Lithuania's largest {{shopping}} centers. Vilniaus duona ("The Bread of Vilnius"), Lithuania's largest <b>baking</b> company, operates {{one of its}} bakeries in Žirmūnai.|$|E
5|$|The campus' {{programs}} include associate degrees in culinary arts and in <b>baking</b> and pastry arts, a 30-week culinary arts certificate program, a 30-week wine and beverage certificate program, and several culinary arts programs {{for students who}} have met basic requirements. Of the campus' 300 students, approximately 60percent are in the culinary arts degree program, 23percent in the <b>baking</b> and pastry arts degree program, and 17percent in a certificate program.|$|E
5|$|The {{company has}} {{branched}} into the <b>baking</b> of breads with special grains and added dietary fibers, reduced-calorie and vitamin-fortified breads, and certified organic products.|$|E
5|$|When {{the company}} went out of {{business}} in 2007, Marietta <b>Baking</b> took over the cookie factory and received interest-free loans, job-training incentives, and partial forgiveness of indebtedness for job creation.|$|E
5|$|Blumenthal {{has since}} updated his recipe {{to include a}} ten-hour period of soaking the bacon in a {{vacuum-packed}} bag prior to <b>baking.</b> He has also changed the presentation so that the unfrozen ice cream is injected into empty egg shells, then dramatically scrambled at the customer's table in liquid nitrogen, giving the impression of cooking.|$|E
5|$|Clotted {{cream can}} be used as an accompaniment to hot or cold desserts. Clotted cream, {{especially}} clotted cream from Devon, where it is less yellow due to lower carotene levels in the grass, is regularly used in <b>baking.</b> It is used throughout southwest England in the production of ice cream and fudge.|$|E
5|$|In the bachelor's degree {{management}} programs, concentrations include Advanced Concepts in <b>Baking</b> and Pastry; Advanced Wine, Beverage, and Hospitality; Asian Cuisine; Farm-to-Table Cooking; Intrapreneurship; Italian Cuisine; and Latin Cuisine. Most {{of these}} concentrations include a semester away at either the CIA's California, Texas, or Singapore campuses.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the turkey}} vulture, this vulture {{is often seen}} {{standing}} in a spread-winged stance. The stance is believed to serve multiple functions: drying the wings, warming the body, and <b>baking</b> off bacteria. This same behavior is displayed by other New World vultures, Old World vultures, and storks.|$|E
5|$|Maple syrup {{is often}} eaten with pancakes, waffles, French toast, oatmeal or porridge. It {{is also used}} as an {{ingredient}} in <b>baking</b> and as a sweetener or flavouring agent. Culinary experts have praised its unique flavour, although the chemistry responsible is not fully understood.|$|E
5|$|Michigan Governor Fred W. Green arrived {{during the}} {{afternoon}} of the disaster and assisted in the relief work, carting bricks away from the scene. The Lawrence <b>Baking</b> Company of Lansing sent a truck filled with pies and sandwiches which were served to rescuers in the township's community hall.|$|E
5|$|Milled sugars (known as confectioner's {{sugar and}} {{powdered}} sugar) are {{ground to a}} fine powder. They are used as powdered sugar (also known as icing sugar or confectionary sugar), for dusting foods and in <b>baking</b> and confectionery.|$|E
5|$|The Gatehouse Restaurant, {{staffed by}} the school's degree program students, is a casual {{restaurant}} serving contemporary food with local ingredients. The Bakery Café by illy {{is run by}} <b>Baking</b> and Pastry Arts Certificate students. The café has sandwiches, salads, soups, and fresh pastries and breads, and also serves coffee, espressos, and teas.|$|E
5|$|The bakery's {{digitally}} controlled ovens continually adjust temperatures {{to accommodate}} the fermenting and <b>baking</b> processes; these ovens can also bake different types of bread at different temperatures {{on the top and}} bottom of each oven. Despite the emphasis on innovation and automation, Angel's challahs are still braided by hand.|$|E
5|$|Aging / Curing: While {{not always}} {{required}}, some teas required additional aging, secondary fermentation, or <b>baking</b> {{to reach their}} drinking potential. For instance, a green tea puerh, prior to curing into a post-fermented tea, is often bitter and harsh in taste, but becomes sweet and mellow through fermentation by age or dampness. Additionally, oolong can benefit from aging if fired over charcoal. Flavoured teas are manufactured in this stage by spraying the tea with aromas and flavours or by storing them with their flavorants.|$|E
5|$|Being very small, {{and unknown}} until the {{invention}} of the microscope, microbes do not feature directly in art or literature before Early Modern times (though they appear indirectly in works about brewing and <b>baking),</b> when Antonie van Leeuwenhoek observed microbes in water in 1676; his results were soon confirmed by Robert Hooke. A few major diseases such as tuberculosis appear in literature, art, film, opera and music.|$|E
5|$|David's {{first five}} books, {{particularly}} the earlier works, contained recipes interspersed with literary quotation {{and descriptions of}} people and places that inspired her. By {{the time of her}} third book, Italian Food, David had begun to add sections {{about the history of the}} cuisine and the particular dishes that she wrote about. Her interest in the history of cooking led her in her later years to research the history of spices, <b>baking,</b> and ice.|$|E
5|$|Enrollment grew to {{approximately}} 1,000 students by 1969, beyond {{the capacity of}} its original campus, so the school purchased the St. Andrew-on-Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park, New York in 1970. In 1971, the college began awarding associate degrees, and opened its doors in Hyde Park in the following year. From 1974 to 1979, the school built three residence halls, a culinary library, a career planning center, and a learning resources center. From 1982 to 1984, the American Bounty and Caterina de' Medici Restaurants and St. Andrew's Café opened. In 1984, the school's continuing education center (later named the J. Willard Marriott Education Center) opened, and the school improved its teaching kitchens and constructed an experimental kitchen and food laboratory. In 1990, the school opened a <b>baking</b> and pastry facility, named two years later as the Shunsuke Takaki School of <b>Baking</b> and Pastry. In 1993, the school opened its Conrad N. Hilton Library and began offering bachelor's degree programs. In 1995, the school's first branch campus opened, the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, California. In 1998, the Student Recreation Center was opened.|$|E
5|$|For {{her kitchen}} {{equipment}} shop, David wrote Dried Herbs, Aromatics and Condiments (1967); English Potted Meats and Fish Pastes (1968); The <b>Baking</b> of an English Loaf (1969); Syllabubs and Fruit Fools (1969), and Green Pepper Berries (1972). Some {{of the content}} was taken from her previously-published magazine articles, and some was further reused and expanded in her later books.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1927 in Jerusalem by Salomon Angel, Angel Bakeries {{introduced}} to the Israeli market the first sliced bread, plant-based emulsifiers, and new <b>baking</b> technologies. It has always been family-run, at first by Salomon with his brothers and sons, then by Salomon's grandsons, and today by Salomon's great-grandsons. The company, Salomon A. Angel Ltd., is publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, with a turnover of $180 million in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs used Swiss Pilatus P-2 army {{training}} planes {{standing in}} for Messerschmitt Bf-109s. He built a device {{based on an}} internal combustion engine to simulate gunfire, which was safer and less expensive than firing blanks. <b>Baking</b> soda was applied to Connery to create Henry's bullet wound. Vinegar was applied to create the foaming effect as {{the water from the}} Grail washes it away.|$|E
5|$|Granulated sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home <b>baking</b> to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{undergraduates}} {{were enrolled}} in five schools: the School of Culinary Arts, the School of <b>Baking</b> and Pastry Arts, the School of Business and Management, the School of Liberal Arts and Food Studies, and the School of Culinary Science and Nutrition. Within the bachelor programs, 83% of student majors are in business management, 10% in culinary science, and 6% are interdisciplinary.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} part, David devotes {{chapters}} to recipes for {{various forms of}} <b>baking.</b> Bread comes first, followed by recipes for, among many other things, buns, yeast cakes, soda-bread, brioches, croissants, pain au chocolat, and pizza. As in her earlier books, the recipes are interspersed with excerpts from earlier authors, including Fernand Braudel, Auguste Escoffier, and the painter John Constable.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that deep fryers be cleaned often to prevent contamination. The process of cooking with oil can also contaminate nearby surfaces as oil may splatter on adjacent areas. Oil vapors can also condense on more distant surfaces such as walls and ceilings. Supplies such as dish detergent and <b>baking</b> soda can effectively clean affected surfaces.|$|E
5|$|Microorganisms {{are used}} in a {{fermentation}} process to make yoghurt, cheese, curd, kefir, ayran, xynogala, {{and other types of}} food. Fermentation cultures provide flavor and aroma, and inhibit undesirable organisms. They are used to leaven bread, and to convert sugars to alcohol in wine and beer. Microorganisms {{are used in}} brewing, wine making, <b>baking,</b> pickling and other food-making processes.|$|E
5|$|Slaves {{were also}} {{employed}} in the home. The domestic's main role was to stand in for his master at his trade and to accompany him on trips. In time of war he was batman to the hoplite. The female slave carried out domestic tasks, in particular bread <b>baking</b> and textile making. Only the poorest citizens did not possess a domestic slave.|$|E
5|$|Sodium {{compounds}} are {{of immense}} commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing glass, paper, soap, and textiles. The most important sodium compounds are table salt (NaCl), soda ash (Na2CO3), <b>baking</b> soda (NaHCO3), caustic soda (NaOH), sodium nitrate (NaNO3), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3·5H2O), and borax (Na2B4O7·10H2O). In compounds, sodium is usually ionically bonded to water and anions, and {{is viewed as}} a hard Lewis acid.|$|E
5|$|Sélestat {{also has}} a museum {{dedicated}} to bread and <b>baking</b> {{and it is the}} seat of the FRAC d'Alsace, a regional institution whose aim is to collect contemporary works of art (see below, Cultural institutions and events). These works are regularly part of temporary exhibits in Sélestat and other places in Alsace. FRAC possesses works by Aurélie Nemours, Olivier Debré, Mario Merz and Panamarenko, among other artists.|$|E
