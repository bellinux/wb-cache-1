In December 2015, Deadline reports that actress Katherine Waterston was cast in the lead role of Daniels. Alien: Covenant will take place {{ten years after the}} events of Prometheus. Scott has stated that the sequel will <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> R rating. In February 2016, Danny McBride entered negotiations to join the film as a crew member of the Covenant ship, along with Demian Bichir, Jussie Smollett, Amy Seimetz, Carmen Ejogo, Callie Hernandez, Alex England and Billy Crudup joining the cast.|$|E
5|$|The stones {{themselves}} are small; on average they measure 0.1 metre (4 inches) in height, 0.3 metre (one foot) in width, and 0.1 metres (4 inches) thick. The largest stands approximately 0.5 metres (1.6 feet) above the ground. Most are incomplete, and likely {{have been broken}} since the original erection of the circle. Although {{it is not known}} if all the stones in the circle come from the same natural rock, a sample was taken from one stone and under examination revealed to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard,</b> pale grey gritstone, likely taken from the nearby Pickwell Down grits. There are conspicuous quartz veins in many of the circle's stones.|$|E
25|$|For the Australians, {{the advance}} through the Markham, Ramu and Faria Valleys proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> slog. Casualties for the 7th Division between 18 September 1943 and 8 April 1944 {{amounted}} to 204 killed and 464 wounded. Disease took {{an even greater}} toll with 13,576 personnel being evacuated. Japanese estimates of their own casualties indicate losses of 800 killed, 400 wounded and 800 dead from disease.|$|E

25|$|During {{his time}} as Ombudsman of the Russian Federation from 2004-2014, Vladimir Lukin, {{invariably}} characterized the human rights situation in Russia as unsatisfactory, while acknowledging that building a law-governed State and civil society in such a complex country as Russia would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> and long process. A former politician and diplomat, Lukin was replaced, first by Ella Pamfilova and then, in April 2016 by Tatyana Moskalkova, a lawyer and professor with the rank of Major-General in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.|$|E
25|$|Several public-key {{cryptography}} algorithms, such as RSA and the Diffie–Hellman key exchange, {{are based on}} large prime numbers (2048-bit primes are common). RSA relies {{on the assumption that}} it is much easier (i.e., more efficient) to perform the multiplication of two (large) numbers x and y than to calculate x and y (assumed coprime) if only the product xy is known. The Diffie–Hellman key exchange relies on {{the fact that there are}} efficient algorithms for modular exponentiation, while the reverse operation the discrete logarithm is thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> problem.|$|E
25|$|Being {{fascinated by}} the Shinsengumi, Watsuki {{designed}} the characters by basing their characteristics {{to that of the}} real Shinsengumi members and also used fictional representation of them and other historical characters from the Bakumatsu period of Japan. The historical characters were considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> task by Watsuki. Due to problems with the characterization from Sagara Sōzō, Watsuki decided to illustrate Saitō Hajime in his own style avoiding the historical figure. He felt very good with Saitō's character having noted he fit very well in the manga. However, Watsuki mentioned that many Japanese fans of the Shinsengumi complained about the personality of Saitō, as he was made sadistic.|$|E

25|$|Balloon flights {{can carry}} {{instruments}} to altitudes {{of up to}} 40km above sea level, where they are above as much as 99.997% of the Earth's atmosphere. Unlike a rocket where data are collected during a brief few minutes, balloons are able to stay aloft for much longer. However, even at such altitudes, much of the X-ray spectrum is still absorbed. X-rays with energies less than 35 keV (5,600 aJ) cannot reach balloons. On July 21, 1964, the Crab Nebula supernova remnant was discovered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> X-ray (15 – 60 keV) source by a scintillation counter flown on a balloon launched from Palestine, Texas, USA. This was likely the first balloon-based detection of X-rays from a discrete cosmic X-ray source.|$|E
25|$|In 1791, {{at the age}} of 16, Eckford left Scotland – {{to which}} he never {{returned}} – to begin a five-year shipbuilding apprenticeship with his mothers brother, the noted Scottish-born Canadian shipwright John Black, at a shipyard Black had established on the St. Lawrence River in Lower Canada. Eckford proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> worker and quick learner, with a flair for shipbuilding and ship design. When Black moved to Kingston on Lake Ontario late in 1792, Eckford followed to continue his apprenticeship, but the two soon went their separate ways, with Black moving to Quebec City to pursue revolutionary politics while Eckford stayed behind in Kingston to continue to learn the shipbuilding trade. In 1794, Eckford joined a Freemason Lodge in Kingston, beginning a long association with Freemasonry.|$|E
25|$|Minnie Marx {{came from}} a family of performers. Her mother was a yodeling harpist and her father a ventriloquist; both were funfair entertainers. Around 1880, the family emigrated to New York City, where Minnie married Sam in 1884. During the early 20th century, Minnie helped her younger brother Abraham Elieser Adolf Schönberg (stage name Al Shean) to enter show business; he became highly {{successful}} on vaudeville and Broadway as half of the musical comedy double act Gallagher and Shean, and this gave the brothers an entree to musical comedy, vaudeville and Broadway at Minnie's instigation. Minnie also acted as the brothers' manager, using the name Minnie Palmer so that agents did not realize that she was also their mother. All the brothers confirmed that Minnie Marx had been the head of the family and the driving force in getting the troupe launched, the only person who could keep them in order; she was said to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> bargainer with theatre management.|$|E

25|$|To {{deal with}} the Bulgarian threat for good, the Byzantines took {{measures}} to end the conflict with the Abbasid Caliphate {{in the east and}} attempted to create a wide anti-Bulgarian coalition. Two envoys were sent to Baghdad, where they secured peace with caliph al-Muqtadir in June 917. The strategos of Dyrrhachium, Leo Rhabdouchos, was instructed to negotiate with the Serbian prince Petar Gojniković, who was a Bulgarian vassal but was willing to renounce Bulgarian suzerainty. However, the court in Preslav was warned about the negotiations by prince Michael of Zahumlje, a loyal ally of Bulgaria, and SimeonI was able to prevent an immediate Serb attack. The Byzantine attempts to approach the Magyars were also successfully countered by the Bulgarian diplomacy. The general John Bogas was sent with rich gifts to the Pechenegs, who inhabited the steppes to the north-east of Bulgaria. The Bulgarians had already established strong connections with the Pechenegs, including through marriages, and Bogas' mission proved to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> one. He did manage to convince some tribes to send aid, but eventually the Byzantine navy refused to transport them to the south of the Danube river, probably {{as a result of the}} jealousy that existed between Bogas and the ambitious admiral Romanos Lekapenos.|$|E
500|$|All {{in-service}} Gripens as of January 2014 are {{powered by}} a Volvo RM12 turbofan engine (now GKN Aerospace Engine Systems), a license-manufactured derivative of General Electric F404, fed by a Y-duct with splitter plates; changes include increased performance and improved reliability to meet single engine use safety criteria, {{as well as a}} greater resistance to bird strike incidents. [...] Several subsystems and components were also redesigned to reduce maintenance demands. [...] By November 2010, the Gripen had accumulated over 143,000 flight hours without a single engine-related failure or incident; Rune Hyrefeldt, head of Military Program management at Volvo Aero, stated: [...] "I think this must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> record to beat for a single-engine application".|$|E

Ken Levine, during an interview on August 30, 2010, said: [...] "I will {{say that it is}} still an active thing and it's something we are actively talking about and actively working on." [...] Verbinski later cited that by trying to maintain the [...] "R" [...] rating, they were unable to find any studios that would back the effort, putting the film's future in jeopardy.|$|E

500|$|Wank Week was criticised in {{the prestigious}} James MacTaggart Memorial Lecture at the 2006 Edinburgh International Television Festival on 25 August, {{only a month}} after Channel 4's initial announcement. Charles Allen, the {{outgoing}} Chief Executive of Channel 4's commercial rival ITV, attacked Channel 4 for deterioration of output and adopting a [...] "begging" [...] approach to finances {{in the run-up to}} terrestrial digital switchover (requesting subsidies for public service output while pursuing a path of commercialism). Wank Week's mention came as part of a critique of programming that Channel 4 was counting towards its [...] "educational" [...] content. Allen joked that he was expecting Wank Week to be included, [...] "but that could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> one to pull off even for Channel 4." [...] The pun was subsequently repeated in the press.|$|E

In fact, there isn't even a setting to let you designate it as your default browser. But for those instance {{where you need to}} fire up a lighting-fast browser for quick surfing, Epiphany will do the trick." [...] She further noted, [...] "Though I still use Firefox as my primary browser, lately it seems to run at a snail's pace. So, {{one of the first things}} I noticed about Epiphany is how quickly it launches. And subsequent page loads on my system are equally as fast." [...] Henry criticized Epiphany for its short list of extensions, singling out the lack of Firebug as a deficiency. Web instead supports Web Inspector offered by the WebKit engine, which has similar functionality.|$|E
500|$|Producer {{and drummer}} Ahmir [...] "Questlove" [...] Thompson issued {{an essay in}} 1999 that {{discussed}} the album's creation and analyzed its songs. He described the project as a [...] "vicarious fantasy", a [...] "new direction of soul for 2000", and [...] "the litmus test that will reveal the most for your personality". He addressed the inspiration behind Voodoo, saying [...] "It was a love for the dead state of black music, a love to show our idols how much they taught us [...] I hope you enjoy it. Just have an open mind to new shit. Just give us that." [...] Questlove discussed his expectations of a reaction from music listeners to the concept, saying in an interview for Entertainment Weekly upon the album's release, [...] "We knew this album would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> pill to swallow. People may want D to play into their R love-god fantasies—wearing Armani suits, singing something sweet in your ear—but he made {{a conscious effort to}} shake people up, to take a chance. It's not a middle-ground record—you're either going to love it or hate it." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the first}} {{third of the}} film, Barton speaks {{constantly}} of his desire to write work which centers on and appeals to [...] "the common man". In one speech he declares: [...] "The hopes and dreams of the common man are as noble as those of any king. It's the stuff of life– [...] why shouldn't it be the stuff of theater? [...] Goddamnit, why should that <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>hard</b> pill to swallow? [...] Don't call it new theater, Charlie; call it real theater. Call it our theater." [...] Yet, despite his rhetoric, Barton is totally unable (or unwilling) to appreciate the humanity of the [...] "common man" [...] living next door to him. Later in the film, Charlie explains that he has brought various horrors upon him because [...] "you DON'T LISTEN!" [...] In his first conversation with Charlie, Barton constantly interrupts Charlie just as he is saying [...] "I could tell you some stories-", demonstrating that despite his fine words he really isn't interested in Charlie's experiences; in another scene, Barton symbolically demonstrates his deafness to the world by stuffing his ears with cotton to block {{the sound of his}} ringing telephone.|$|E
