5|$|Sir John William Dawson, McGill's {{principal}} from 1855 to 1893, {{is often}} credited with transforming the school {{into a modern}} university. He recruited the aid of Montreal's wealthiest citizens (eighty percent of Canada's wealth was then controlled <b>by</b> <b>families</b> who lived within the Golden Square Mile area that surrounded the university), many of whom donated property and funding needed to construct the campus buildings. Their names adorn many of the campus's prominent buildings.|$|E

5|$|According to the 2000 Census, of the 17,890 {{housing units}} inside city limits, 15,966 were {{occupied}}, 10,033 of them <b>by</b> <b>families.</b> 31.1% of occupied households had {{children under the}} age of 18, 36.2% were married couples living together, 23.3% consisted of a female householder with no husband present, and 37.2% were non-families. 33.2% of all households were made up of individuals, and 14.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.39 and the average family size was 3.06. The average household size has steadily decreased since 1970, when it was 3.04. Meridian's median age has increased from 30.4 in 1970 to 34.6 in 2000.|$|E
5|$|Administration and {{religion}} were closely linked {{in the system}} of the Celestial Masters. Adherents were grouped <b>by</b> <b>families,</b> and each was attached to a district. Families and districts, and the gods all held copies of civil registers. The registers were detailed records of the people, and recorded each person's rank, identity and location. Any changes to those registered had to be accompanied by a monetary contribution known as a 'wage of faith.' Requests to the gods followed a bureaucratic model, and were drawn up according to specific administrative codes. The effectiveness of these requests depended upon the accuracy of the registers kept by the gods.|$|E

5|$|Brought by explorers, {{queen conch}} shells {{quickly became a}} popular asset in early modern Europe. In the late 17th century they were widely used as {{decoration}} over fireplace mantels and English gardens, among other places. In contemporary times, queen conch shells are mainly utilized in handicraft. Shells are made into cameos, bracelets and lamps, and traditionally as doorstops or decorations <b>by</b> <b>families</b> of seafaring men. The shell continues to be popular as a decorative object, though its export is now regulated and restricted by the CITES agreement. In modern culture, queen conch shells are often represented in everyday objects such as coins and stamps.|$|E
5|$|Children {{arrived at}} the camp in an {{emaciated}} and weak condition from other camps within the Ustaše camp system, {{with a total of}} 3,336 children passing through the camp. Between 449 and 1500 children died there, mainly from disease and malnutrition. A sub-camp was established in nearby Donja Reka. The Yugoslav Partisans liberated about 350 children from the main camp inAugust 1942. In October 1942, about 500 of the surviving children were dispersed among local families by the Catholic aid group, Caritas; 1,637 boys and girls were taken in <b>by</b> <b>families</b> in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages, and another 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška.|$|E
5|$|The Lubitz family held a {{press conference}} on 24 March 2017, two years after the crash. Lubitz's father said that they did not accept the {{official}} investigative findings that Andreas Lubitz deliberately caused the crash or that he had been depressed at the time. They presented aviation journalist Tim van Beveren, whom they had commissioned to publish a new report, which asserted that Lubitz could have fallen unconscious, that the cockpit door lock had malfunctioned on previous flights, and that potentially dangerous turbulence had been reported in the area {{on the day of the}} crash. The timing of the press conference by Lubitz's father, on the anniversary of the crash, was criticized <b>by</b> <b>families</b> of the victims, who were holding their own remembrances on that day.|$|E

5|$|The Partisan {{attack on}} the camp and their liberation of a {{significant}} number of children brought the Ustaše to the realisation that this and similar camps for children could not be maintained. In late October 1942, 500 of the remaining children were dispersed to families in the surrounding villages by the Catholic aid group, Caritas. A total of 1,637 boys and girls were taken in <b>by</b> <b>families</b> in Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and surrounding villages. Of the remaining children, 113 were relocated to Bosanska Gradiška. The Jastrebarsko camp was then dismantled.|$|E
5|$|The ship {{found so}} many bodies that the {{embalming}} supplies aboard were quickly exhausted. Health regulations permitted that only embalmed bodies could {{be returned to}} port. Captain Larnder of the Mackay-Bennett and the undertakers aboard decided to preserve all bodies of First Class passengers {{because of the need}} to visually identify wealthy men to resolve any disputes over large estates. As a result, the majority of the burials at sea were third class passengers and crew. Larnder himself claimed that as a mariner, he would expect to be buried at sea. However complaints about the burials at sea were made <b>by</b> <b>families</b> and undertakers. Later ships such as Minia found fewer bodies, requiring fewer embalming supplies, and were able to limit burials at sea to bodies which were too damaged to preserve.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{complex is}} a {{collection}} of five temples, including a Buddhist temple. The central temple dedicated to Shiva (Siva) is the most prestigious and biggest, and is popular amongst Hindus. The other temples are dedicated to Ganesha, Ayyanayake and Kali. The Kali temple is also popular with Buddhists, who frequent the complex. Post-19th century, most of the devotees of all temples in the complex belong to the majority Sinhala Buddhist ethnic group; the temples, excluding the Ayyanayake and the Buddhist temple, are administered <b>by</b> <b>families</b> belonging to the minority Hindu Tamils.|$|E

5|$|An {{association}} with the folliculin (FLCN) gene was first reported in 2002. This 14-exon gene {{is located on the}} short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2) and has a cytosine-rich region in exon 11 particularly susceptible to mutation. The most common mutation in this region is the insertion or deletion of a cytosine residue, found in 53% of Birt–Hogg–Dubé families. There is {{no significant difference in the}} symptoms experienced <b>by</b> <b>families</b> with an insertion at that location compared to those who have a deletion. However, mutations in FLCN associated with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome are heterogeneous, and are often nonsense mutations or frameshift mutations that cause early truncation of the protein product at the carboxy-terminus. Very rarely, missense mutations are observed. Mutations are often passed from one generation to the next in an autosomal dominant fashion but can occur as a new mutation in an individual with no prior family history (a de novo mutation). The children of an affected parent each have a 50% chance of having the disease. Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome has very high penetrance. A correlation between different FLCN genotypes and phenotypes has not been discovered.|$|E
5|$|In May 1920 Princess Matoika took {{on board}} the bodies of ten female nurses and over 400soldiers who died while on duty in France during the war. The ship then transited the Kiel Canal and picked up 1,600U.S. {{residents}} of Polish descent at Danzig, {{all of whom had}} enlisted in the Polish Army {{at the outset of the}} war. Also included among the passengers were 500U.S. soldiers who had been released from occupation duty at Koblenz. The ship arrived at New York on 23May with little fanfare and no ceremony; bodies returned but not claimed <b>by</b> <b>families</b> were buried at Arlington National Cemetery. On 21 July, Princess Matoika arrived in New York after a similar voyage with 25war brides, many repatriated Polish troops among its 2,094 steerage passengers, and the remains of 881soldiers. In between these two trips, the Belgian Ambassador to the United States, Baron Emile de Cartier de Marchienne, sailed from New York to Belgium {{on board the}} Matoika. It was, however, Princess Matoikas next trip to Belgium that was the most infamous.|$|E
5|$|Non-human mammals play a {{wide variety}} of roles in human culture. They are the most popular of pets, with tens of {{millions}} of dogs, cats and other animals including rabbits and mice kept <b>by</b> <b>families</b> around the world. Mammals such as mammoths, horses and deer are among the earliest subjects of art, being found in Upper Paleolithic cave paintings such as at Lascaux. Major artists such as Albrecht Dürer, George Stubbs and Edwin Landseer are known for their portraits of mammals. Many species of mammals have been hunted for sport and for food; deer and wild boar are especially popular as game animals. Mammals such as horses and dogs are widely raced for sport, often combined with betting on the outcome. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own. Mammals further play {{a wide variety}} of roles in literature, film, mythology, and religion.|$|E

5|$|Permanent {{habitation}} on {{this part}} of the St. Johns River came only during Florida's British period, when officials established a ferry crossing at the Cow Ford in 1760. The ferry docked on the river's southern bank, which was thus populated continuously long before what is now downtown Jacksonville. When the Spanish resumed control of Florida in 1783 they built Fort San Nicolas beside the ferry landing in present-day St. Nicholas. In 1793 the Spanish government issued a land grant for a slave plantation, which was eventually taken over by Isaac Hendricks. By 1850, Hendricks had married Elizabeth Hudnall, who owned a large adjacent tract, and his daughter Margaret married Albert Gallatin Philips, owner of the nearby Red Bank Plantation; as a result much of the area was owned <b>by</b> <b>families</b> connected to each other by marriage.|$|E
