5|$|Joseph {{broke into}} the NHL in 1989, playing for the St. Louis Blues. In the {{off-season}} following the 1990–91 NHL season, the Blues signed Brendan Shanahan from the New Jersey Devils. Shanahan was a restricted free agent, and thus the Devils were entitled to compensation. The teams could not agree on what the compensation was; the Blues offered Curtis Joseph, Rod Brind'Amour, and two draft picks, while the Devils wanted Scott Stevens. Joseph seemed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> the Devils were looking for in goal, however the case went to arbitration, and a judge ruled that Stevens was to be awarded to the Devils in September 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, it was {{announced}} that long-time supporting actors Ken Kitson and Louis Emerick had returned to Holmfirth to reprise their roles as Police Constables Cooper and Walsh in the pilot for a new proposed spin-off, Cooper and Walsh. Alan J.W. Bell as well as crew from Last of the Summer Wine were involved in the creation of two short films while Kitson and Emerick appealed for funding through crowd-sourcing sites in the hopes of gaining enough support to produce a feature film featuring the duo or even a television series. Associate Producer Terry Bartlam believed there was enough of a cope with Cooper and Walsh that they could carry their own series and that this spin-off could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to those who believed Last of the Summer Wine should have been given a proper ending.|$|E

500|$|The race {{ended in}} 1902 with the British-arbitrated Pacts of May, which {{contained}} a binding naval-limiting agreement.

The pacts proved to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to the Argentine and Chilean disputes, as the countries enjoyed a period of warm relations. This did not last, though, as the Brazilian government's attempt to rebuild its own naval forces sparked another naval arms race, involving all three countries' orders for revolutionary new [...] "dreadnoughts", powerful battleships whose capabilities far outstripped older vessels in the world's navies.|$|E

However, he was critical of its plot, noting that [...] "the series pretty much just picks Cassandra to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> to a lot of questions" [...] concerning the show's mythology. Not all reviews were so glowing. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a mixed review and awarded it two stars out of four. Vitaris wrote positively of the episode's filming, writing, [...] "visually, the episode looks good [...] but the scenes in the hangar are eye-poppers, with doors slowly opening and aliens walking forward, obscured by bright light." [...] However, she criticized the episode's plot, noting that [...] "Two Fathers" [...] was [...] "heading straight down a path already trodden by dozens of books, short stories, movies, and other television shows." ...|$|E

George Miles realised that a tandem-wing fighter could be built to fit onto carrier elevators without folding and that the pilot could be seated in the nose, giving an excellent view for carrier landings. Among the solutions considered, the tandem wing configuration appeared to Miles to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> provided it was [...] "aerodynamically feasible".|$|E

2500|$|These five ideas {{turn out}} to be {{discrete}} variables, but the profit rate will go up or down, depending on the choice of measure. Andrew Kliman states in his book The failure of capitalist production that [...] "I believe that there are many different legitimate ways of measuring rates of profit, and that none serves as an all-purpose measure. The most relevant rate of profit to consider always depends upon the particular question being addressed." [...] This pluralist approach provides plenty possibilities for all kinds of different interpretations of all kinds of profit rates, depending on what the question is thought to be, to which a profit rate is supposed to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b>|$|E

For example, vouchers could be granted through thousands of Community Health Programs (CHPs), each of which would agree on its own definition of the public good.

2500|$|Scientists often {{look for}} Fermi {{estimates}} of {{the answer to a}} problem before turning to more sophisticated methods to calculate a precise answer. This provides a useful check on the results. While the estimate is almost certainly incorrect, it is also a simple calculation that allows for easy error checking, and to find faulty assumptions if the figure produced is far beyond what we might reasonably expect. By contrast, precise calculations can be extremely complex but with the expectation that the answer they produce is correct. The far larger number of factors and operations involved can obscure a very significant error, either in mathematical process or in the assumptions the equation is based on, but the result may still be assumed to be right because it has been derived from a precise formula that is expected to yield good results. Without a reasonable frame of reference to work from it is seldom clear if a result is acceptably precise or is many degrees of magnitude (tens or hundreds of times) too big or too small. The Fermi estimation gives a quick, simple way to obtain this frame of reference for what might reasonably be expected to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer,</b> giving context to the results.|$|E
2500|$|Reflecting on {{not just}} the {{situation}} in Tunisia and Egypt {{but also on the}} 2011 Yemeni protests, and the 2011 Jordanian protests, Clinton said at a February 5 meeting of the Quartet on the Middle East, [...] "The region is being battered by a perfect storm of powerful trends. ... This is what has driven demonstrators into the streets of ... cities throughout the region. The status quo is simply not sustainable." [...] She said that while transition to democracy could be chaotic – and free elections had to be accompanied by free speech, a free judiciary, {{and the rule of law}} in order to be effective – in the end [...] "free people govern themselves best". The transformations highlighted that traditional U.S. foreign policy in the region had sided with rulers who suppressed internal dissent but provided stability and generally supported U.S. goals in the region. When the monarchy's response to the 2011 Bahraini protests turned violent, Clinton urged a return to the path of reform, saying that violence against the protesters [...] "is absolutely unacceptable ... We very much want to see the human rights of the people protected, including right to assemble, right to express themselves, and we want to see reform." [...] At the same time, she said that the U.S. [...] "cannot tell countries what they are going to do [...] cannot dictate the outcomes." [...] As the situation in Bahrain lingered on and continued to have episodes of violence against protesters, Clinton said in mid-March, [...] "Our goal is a credible political process that can address the legitimate aspirations of all the people of Bahrain ... Violence is not and cannot <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>answer.</b> A political process is.
