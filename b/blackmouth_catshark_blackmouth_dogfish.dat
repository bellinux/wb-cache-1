40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results on nine {{of the most important}} elasmobranch fish species of the nine years (2001 - 2009) of the Porcupine bank Spanish surveys. The main species in biomass terms in Porcupine bank bottom trawl survey, in decreasing biomass abundance order, are: <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark,</b> birdbeak <b>dogfish,</b> velvet belly, Knifetooth dogfish, lesser spotted dogfish, bluntnose sixgill shark, sandy ray, cuckoo ray and common skate. Many of these species occupy mainly the deep areas covered in the survey, especially birdbeak dogfish, knifetooth dogfish and velvet belly. Less confined to deeper grounds are <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> and sandy ray, while lesser spotted dogfish and cuckoo ray inhabit mainly the shallower grounds close to the Irish shelf or the central mound in the bank. Length distributions of these species along the survey series are also presented and discussed. The few available data on siki sharks from the Porcupine bank survey are also summarized.

25|$|In 1953, Belgian {{ichthyologist}} Max Poll {{published a}} report on sharks and chimaeras captured during a 194849 Belgian oceanographic expedition off western Africa, including several seemingly ovoviviparous <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catsharks</b> (G. melastomus). As the <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> {{is known to be}} oviparous, Poll's account alerted French zoologist Jean Cadenat to the presence of a distinct catshark species in the region.

40|$|The shark species, <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> (Galeus melastomus), {{velvet belly}} (Etmopterus spinax) and coastal spotted dogfish (Scyliorhinus canicula) are an {{important}} by-catch of the Balearic Islands (Western Mediterranean) trawl fishery. The catch compositions of the fishery taking these species is described and analysed in terms of landings and discards. Only two of these species are sufficiently abundant to be recorded in the landings (<b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> and spotted <b>dogfish).</b> The length compositions {{in terms of both}} landings and discards were analysed for these two species. Spotted dogfish catches reached similar proportions to those of the target species in the coastal fishery (red and striped red mullet) and in the shelf trawl fishery (European hake); whereas the catches of <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> and velvet belly were a small proportion of the total catch in the slope fishery for red shrimp. The size range of the spotted dogfish was between 7 and 53 cm TL. Juveniles and adults were distributed throughout the whole area, although adults appeared to be more abundant in the coastal zone. The length distribution of <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> showed a trend of increasing size with depth; the size range was between 9 and 63 cm TL. For both species, individuals smaller than 35 cm TL were usually discarded. Only 25 % by number and 60 % by weight of the total spotted dogfish catch was landed. For the total <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> catch, the corresponding percentages were 10 % by number and 35 % by weight.

It has also been seen resting motionless on the bottom.

5|$|The <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> is an active, generalist {{predator}} {{that feeds}} on both bottom-dwelling and free-swimming organisms.

Mating and egg-deposition take place all year round, with two reproductive peaks of activity, in winter and summer. Egg capsules are, on average, 54 mm long and 21 mm wide, with a maximum of 63 x 25 mm encountered.

40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} Scyliorhinus canicula and Galeus melastomus were {{investigated}} by ana-lysing the stomach contents from 6 036 individuals collected on research surveys {{in the southern}} region of the Bay of Biscay during the autumns of 1988 – 2001. These catshark species are the most abundant scyliorhinids on the Cantabrian shelf. Their depth ranges partly overlap, although they occur in different habitats. Both catshark species are opportunistic scavengers, with their main prey being fish and crustaceans. Diets of the two species overlap; they are most similar in individuals < 30 cm total length (TL) where euphausiids are important prey, but, for individuals ≥ 30 cm TL, fish (mainly discarded from trawlers) are important prey. Lesser-spotted catshark are mostly benthic feeders and they feed on a greater diversity of prey than <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark,</b> which are more suprabenthic.

50|$|This {{species is}} found in the mesopelagic zone of the ocean at depths down to 1600 metres.

5|$|Along {{with the}} <b>blackmouth</b> <b>catshark</b> (Galeus melastomus) and the Portuguese dogfish (Centroscymnus coelolepis), the velvet belly {{is one of}} the most {{abundant}} deep-sea sharks in the northeastern Atlantic. It is found individually or in small shoals. Samplings in the Mediterranean have found females outnumbering males across all ages; this imbalance increases in the older age classes. In the Rockall Trough and the Catalan Sea, large adults are found in deeper waters than juveniles, which may serve to reduce competition between the two groups. However, this pattern has not been observed at other sites in the eastern Mediterranean.|$|R
