40|$|Purpose. To {{identify}} {{the productivity of}} the genus Salix L. plants and study the relationship between its structural elements. Methods. Field study, laboratory analysis, analytical approach. Results. It {{was found that the}} height of a three-year plants of species ranged from 86. 0 to 775. 1 cm, of hybrid forms – from 197. 0 to 488. 0 cm. Average diameter of three-year plants varied in the range of 19. 10 to 52. 94 mm (species) and from 28. 04 to 49. 23 mm (hybrid forms). The highest stability for complex of morphological characters was observed in bog willow samples. It was determined that among species <b>basket</b> <b>willow</b> (16. 94 t/ha) and white willow (21. 19 t/ha) were the most productive for dry biomass yield per 1 hectare, among hybrid forms – purple willow × <b>basket</b> <b>willow</b> (23. 36 t/ha) and <b>basket</b> <b>willow</b> × bog willow (18. 57 t/ha). It was established that the value of the plants productivity was characterized by moderate, significant and close correlations with the average diameter of plants, length and number of shoots of the second order. Conclusions. A comprehensive assessment of productivity traits of three-year plants from willow collection was conducted, index of dry matter yield per 1 hectare was defined. The links between quantitative traits that characterize the contribution of some of them in productivity index were investigated. Method of cluster analysis was used to group samples for the similarity of complex agronomic characters. <b>Basket</b> <b>willow</b> and white willow as well as such hybrid forms as <b>basket</b> <b>willow</b> × bog willow and purple willow × <b>basket</b> <b>willow</b> were recommended to use as a source material for selection of samples with high productivity...|$|E

40|$|Background: Hybridization and {{introgression}} {{are said}} to occur relatively frequently in plants, and in particular among different species of willows. However, data on the actual frequency of natural hybridization and introgression is rare. Here, we report the first fine-scale genetic analysis of a contact zone shared between the three <b>basket</b> <b>willow</b> species, Salix dasyclados, S. schwerinii and S. viminalis {{in the vicinity of}} the Lake Baikal in Southern Siberia. Individuals were sampled in fourteen populations and classified as pure species or hybrids based on a set of morphological characters. They were then genotyped at 384 nuclear SNP and four chloroplast SSR loci. The STRUCTURE and NewHybrids softwares were used to estimate the frequency and direction of hybridization using genotypic data at the nuclear SNP loci. Results: As many as 19 % of the genotyped individuals were classified as introgressed individuals and these were mainly encountered in the centre of the contact zone. All introgressed individuals were backcrosses to S. viminalis or S. schwerinii and no F 1 or F 2 hybrids were found. The rest of the genotyped individuals were classified as pure species and formed two clusters, one with S. schwerinii individuals and the other with S. viminalis and S. dasyclados individuals. The two clusters were significantly genetically differentiated, with FST = 0. 333 (0. 282 – 0. 382, p < 0. 001).

40|$|Willow {{is often}} used in {{bio-energy}} plantations for its potential {{to function as a}} renewable energy source, but knowledge about its effect on soil carbon dynamics is limited. Therefore, we investigated the temporal variation in carbon dynamics in willow, focusing on below-ground allocation and sequestration to soil carbon pools. <b>Basket</b> <b>willow</b> plants (Salix viminalis L.) in their second year of growth were grown in pots in a greenhouse. At five times during the plants growth, namely 0, 1, 2, 3 and 4 months after breaking winter dormancy, a subset of the plants were continuously labelled with 14 CO 2 in an ESPAS growth chamber for 28 days. After the labelling, the plants were harvested and separated into leaves, first and second year stems and roots. The soil was analysed for total C and 14 C content as well as soil microbial biomass. Immediately after breaking dormancy, carbon stored in the first year stems was relocated to developing roots and leaves. Almost half the newly assimilated C was used for leaf development the first month of growth, dropping to below 15 n the older plants. Within the second month of growth, secondary growth of the stem became the largest carbon sink in the system, and remained so for the older age classes. Between 31 and 41 f the recovered 14 C was allocated to below-ground pools. While the fraction of assimilated 14 C in roots and root soil respiration did not vary with plant age, the amount allocated to soil and soil microbial biomass increased in the older plants, indicating an increasing rhizodeposition. The total amount of soil microbial biomass was 30 arger in the oldest age class than in an unplanted control soil. The results demonstrate a close linkage between photosynthesis and below-ground carbon dynamics. Up to 13 f the microbial biomass consisted of carbon assimilated by the willows within the past 4 weeks, up to 11 f the recovered 14 C was found as soil organic matte...|$|E
