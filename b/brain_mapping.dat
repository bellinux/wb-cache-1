In the present, Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), leaves Grey {{and their two children}} to go to Washington to resign from the President's <b>brain</b> <b>mapping</b> project. While she is at Grey-Sloan, Grey returns a call from Shepherd as he drives to the airport, and the two speak briefly until his phone loses its signal. Shortly thereafter, Shepherd witnesses a road accident and stops to help the victims. He rescues a young girl named Winnie (Savannah Paige Rae), and helps her mother who has a dislocated leg. With assistance from Winnie, he rescues another couple from their car right before it explodes, and offers them emergency medical care.|$|E

Surinder Koli also revealed that all deaths had taken place through strangulation. He would then rape them before taking the bodies to his personal washroom and dismembering them.

25|$|Each year, about 400,000 people undergo <b>brain</b> <b>mapping</b> during neurosurgery. This {{procedure}} is often required {{for people with}} tumors or epilepsy that {{do not respond to}} medication. During this procedure, electrodes are placed on the brain to precisely identify the locations of structures and functional areas. Patients may be awake during neurosurgery and asked to perform certain tasks, such as moving fingers or repeating words. This is necessary so that surgeons can remove only the desired tissue while sparing other regions, such as critical movement or language regions. Removing too much brain tissue can cause permanent damage, while removing too little tissue can leave the underlying condition untreated and require additional neurosurgery. Thus, there is a strong need to improve both methods and systems to map the brain as effectively as possible.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} many {{contributing}} factors and risks associated with strokes, {{there are very few}} associated with Dejerine–Roussy syndrome and thalamic lesions specifically. In general, strokes damage one hemisphere of the brain, which can include the thalamus. The thalamus is generally believed to relay sensory information between a variety of subcortical areas and the cerebral cortex. It is known that sensory information from environmental stimuli travels to the thalamus for processing and then to the somatosensory cortex for interpretation. The final product of this communication is the ability to see, hear or feel something as interpreted by the brain. Dejerine–Roussy syndrome most often compromises tactile sensation. Therefore, the damage in the thalamus causes miscommunication between the afferent pathway and the cortex of the brain, changing what or how one feels. The change could be an incorrect sensation experienced, or inappropriate amplification or dulling of a sensation. Because the brain is considered plastic and each individual's brain is different, {{it is almost impossible to}} know how a sensation will be changed without <b>brain</b> <b>mapping</b> and individual consultation.|$|E
25|$|The primary form of fMRI {{uses the}} blood-oxygen-level {{dependent}} (BOLD) contrast, discovered by Seiji Ogawa. This {{is a type}} of specialized brain and body scan used to map neural activity in the brain or spinal cord of humans or other animals by imaging the change in blood flow (hemodynamic response) related to energy use by brain cells. Since the early 1990s, fMRI has come to dominate <b>brain</b> <b>mapping</b> research because it does not require people to undergo shots or surgery, to ingest substances, or to be exposed to ionising radiation. This measure is frequently corrupted by noise from various sources; hence, statistical procedures are used to extract the underlying signal. The resulting brain activation can be graphically represented by color-coding the strength of activation across the brain or the specific region studied. The technique can localize activity to within millimeters but, using standard techniques, no better than within a window of a few seconds. Other methods of obtaining contrast are arterial spin labeling and diffusion MRI. The latter procedure is similar to BOLD fMRI but provides contrast based on the magnitude of diffusion of water molecules in the brain.|$|E

40|$|Brain {{decoding}} is {{a popular}} multivariate approach for hypothesis testing in neuroimaging. It {{is well known that}} the <b>brain</b> <b>maps</b> derived from weights of linear classifiers are hard to interpret because of high correlations between predictors, low signal to noise ratios, and the high dimensionality of neuroimaging data. Therefore, improving the interpretability of brain decoding approaches is of primary interest in many neuroimaging studies. Despite extensive studies of this type, at present, there is no formal definition for interpretability of multivariate <b>brain</b> <b>maps.</b> As a consequence, there is no quantitative measure for evaluating the interpretability of different brain decoding methods. In this paper, first, we present a theoretical definition of interpretability in brain decoding; we show that the interpretability of multivariate <b>brain</b> <b>maps</b> can be decomposed into their reproducibility and representativeness. Second, as an application of the proposed theoretical definition, we formalize a heuristic method for approximating the interpretability of multivariate <b>brain</b> <b>maps</b> in a binary magnetoencephalography (MEG) decoding scenario. Third, we propose to combine the approximated interpretability and the performance of the brain decoding model into a new multi-objective criterion for model selection. Our results for the MEG data show that optimizing the hyper-parameters of the regularized linear classifier based on the proposed criterion results in more informative multivariate <b>brain</b> <b>maps.</b> More importantly, the presented definition provides the theoretical background for quantitative evaluation of interpretability, and hence, facilitates the development of more effective brain decoding algorithms in the future...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In all mammals, {{much of the}} neocortex {{consists}} of orderly representations or maps of receptor surfaces that are typically topographic at a global level, while being modular at the local level. These representations appear to emerge in de-velopment {{as a result of}} a few interacting factors, and different aspects of <b>brain</b> <b>maps</b> may be developmentally linked. As a result, evolutionary selection for some map features may re-quire other features that may not be adaptive. Yet, an overall adaptiveness of <b>brain</b> <b>maps</b> seems likely. Most notably, topo-graphic representations permit interconnections between ap-propriate sets of neurons to be made in a highly efficient man-ner.

[...] Penfield and Jasper also used electrical stimulation during ECoG recordings in patients undergoing epilepsy surgery under local anesthesia.

[...] It may be that most brain functions will only be described correctly after being measured with much more fine-grained measurements that look not at large regions but instead at {{a very large number of}} tiny individual brain circuits.
