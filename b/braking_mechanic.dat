40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the importance of}} simulation of metal flow in deep drawing process which employs an antilock <b>brake</b> <b>mechanic</b> system. Controlling the force and friction of the blank holder is imperative {{to assure that the}} sheet metal is not locked on the blank holder, and hence it flows smoothly into the die. The simulation was developed based on the material displacement, deformation and deep drawing force on flange in the radial direction, that it is controlled by blank holder with antilock <b>brake</b> <b>mechanic</b> system. The force to blank holder was applied periodically and the magnitude of force was kept constant during simulation process. In this study, the mechanical properties of the material were choses such that they equivalent to those of low carbon steel with its thickness of 0. 2 mm. The diameter and the depth of the cylindrical cup-shaped product were 40 mm and 10 mm, respectively. The simulation results showed that the application of antilock <b>brake</b> <b>mechanic</b> system improves the ability to control the material flow during the drawing process, although the maximum blank holder force of 13000 N was applied. The optimum condition was found when the drawing process was performed using blank holder force of 3500 N, deep drawing force of 7000 N, friction coefficient of 0. 25 and speed of punch stroke of 0. 84 mm/sec. This research demonstrated that an antilock <b>brake</b> <b>mechanic</b> system can be implemented effectively to prevent cracking in deep drawing process...|$|R
40|$|We {{analyzed}} cumulative lifetime {{exposure to}} chrysotile asbestos experienced by <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics</b> in the US {{during the period}} 1950 – 2000. Using Monte Carlo methods, cumulative exposures were calculated using the distribution of 8 -h time-weighted average exposure concentrations for <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics</b> {{and the distribution of}} job tenure data for automobile mechanics. The median estimated cumulative exposures for these mechanics, as predicted by three probabilistic models, ranged from 0. 16 to 0. 41 fibers per cubic centimeter (f/cm 3) year for facilities with no dust-control procedures (1970 s), and from 0. 010 to 0. 012 f/cm 3 year for those employing engineering controls (1980 s). Upper-bound (95 %) estimates for the 1970 s and 1980 s were 1. 96 to 2. 79 and 0. 07 – 0. 10 f/cm 3 year, respectively. These estimates for US <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics</b> are consistent with, but generally slightly lower than, those reported for European mechanics. The values are all substantially lower than the cumulative exposure of 4. 5 f/cm 3 year associated with occupational exposure to 0. 1 f/cm 3 of asbestos for 45 years that is currently permitted under the current occupational exposure limits in the US. Cumulative exposures were usually about 100 - to 1, 000 -fold less than those of other occupational groups with asbestos exposure for similar time periods. The cumulative lifetime exposure estimates presented here, combined with the negative epidemiology data for <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics,</b> could be used to refine the risk assessments for chrysotile-exposed populations...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To reanalyse data on {{the lung}} content of {{asbestos}} fibres among <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics.</b> Methods: I re-analysed data published by Butnor, Roggli and colleagues on the lung content of chrysotile and tremolite asbestos fibres among <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics</b> and controls. Statistics of the distributions were estimated by maximum likelihood to accommodate observations below the detection limit. Mean concentrations were compared by the t-test, bootstrap resampling and interval-censored survival methods. Results: The mean concentrations of fibres were higher among the brake workers than the controls. The concentration of tremolite fibres was higher than the concentration of chrysotile, a pattern similar to that observed among Quebec chrysotile miners and millers. Conclusions: Re-analysis of published data {{does not support the}} interpretation that, in auto-motive brake repair workers with malignant mesothelioma, asbestos content is within the normal range. The alternative interpretation that <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics</b> have a greater than back-ground burden of asbestos fibres, attributable to occupational exposure to dusts from friction products manufactured from Canadian chrysotile, appears more credible. This asbestos bur-den might be associated with an increased risk of asbestos-associated cancers...|$|R
50|$|Due to its efficacy, {{chrysotile}} asbestos {{was often a}} component in brake linings. However, studies such as a 1989 National Institutes of Health item showed an uncommonly high proportion of <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics</b> were afflicted with pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, {{both of which are}} linked to chrysotile and asbestos exposure. Public health authorities generally recommend against inhaling brake dust, chrysotile has been banned in many developed countries, such as Australia in late 2003, and chrysotile has been progressively replaced in most brake linings and pads by other fibers such as the synthetic aramids.|$|R
40|$|What {{we found}} most {{disturbing}} is that apparently neither Dr Finkelstein nor the reviewers of his paper carefully read the publication by Butnor et al. (2003) of which Dr Finkelstein’s paper was so critical. As was clearly {{pointed out in}} the paper by Butnor et al. in both the tables and the text, 3 of the 10 <b>brake</b> <b>mechanic</b> mesothelioma patients studied had ele-vated levels of either chrysotile or non-commercial amphibole asbestos fibers (one case had elevated levels of both). Hence, it might be expected that as a group, the average level of chrysotile or non-commercial amphibole fibers among brake mechan-ics would exceed the average levels of the 20 controls. Therefore, the findings in Dr Finkelstein’s paper are neither novel nor unexpected...|$|R
2500|$|Emergency brakes do {{not stop}} very well, as the {{stopping}} force provided by the emergency brake {{is less than half}} the force of normal braking and takes much longer to stop a vehicle. For vehicles with manual transmissions, the mechanical emergency brake is routinely used to assist in hill starts as this frees both feet for use on the accelerator and clutch pedals. Even an unskilled motorist can get started without rolling backwards. It is inadvisable to use rear wheel emergency brakes when the standard brakes are available, unless {{there is a problem with}} the front wheels such as a tire blowout or slippery conditions risking a loss of control. Using the emergency brake while driving changes the traction balance between the front and rear of the vehicle, if over applied may lock the back wheels and skid the car into a handbrake turn. Handbrake turns are often used in street racing to initiate rear wheel drift. In conditions near freezing where it is both wet and icy, the emergency <b>brake</b> <b>mechanics</b> may freeze and be impossible to release until thawed. If only using the [...] "park" [...] function on a transmission to hold the car parked, there is no freezing problem.|$|R

Picard claimed that when she spun around her back was injured.|$|R
40|$|When {{designing}} a new legged robot {{it is important}} to think about what the robot has to do. It is not the same a non-stop walking robot than a legged robot which has to be at the same position much longer than moving. For the second kind of robot, it could be a great improvement to add a break in each actuated joint, so it is not necesary to wasted energy during the stoped time. And not only that, thanks to the brake, it is possible to achive heavier loads using a speci c walking pattern in which you always place the center of mass on the three legs that are not moving in that moment (with the brake activated), while make the next step with the fourth leg. The most common <b>braking</b> systems are <b>mechanic,</b> whether using an electro- magnetic brake or some other kind of friction-based brake in addition to any sort of actuator, e. g., hidraulic, electric,... Even though they have been deeply studied, there are some disadvantage by using <b>mechanic</b> <b>braking</b> systems, i. e., the high prices and the bad holding torque/weight relation, important aspect for a legged robot. This thesis presents a conceptual idea for a braking system based on the thermodinamic control of Hot Melt Adhesive (HMA), as well as the basic char- acteristics of this material and a long leg prototype which shows the feasibility of this concept...|$|R
50|$|By 15:00, the Corvette SS {{was listed}} amongst the retirements. Word from the pit lane, was that {{persistent}} overheating problems {{led to the}} withdrawal, although the official classifications show the cause to be failed rear suspension. Fangio was still leading and Moss finally decided to hand his car over to his co-driver, Harry Schell. At 15:19, Portago brought his Ferrari with serious <b>brake</b> trouble. The <b>mechanics</b> couldn’t seem to remedy the problem and let the car back onto the track with Luigi Musso behind the wheel. Portago reported that the car had “no brakes”.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} study the typical fault types of Field (Factory) Special Motor Vehicle in the {{inspection}} process, we visited many warehouses and wharves in Huangpu District for inspection research, then summarizedthe typical failure modesand took its failure causes and treatment measures for key research. First, wemade statistics and summarized the failure law according to the typical fault types among the old vehicles of annual test. Then we analyzed the concrete manifestation and summarized the failure causes from the <b>braking</b> performance, knuckle <b>mechanic,</b> tire wear, fork loose and other failures of forklift. Then we aimed at the new vehicles of test and acceptance of fault type for statistical analysis. Finally, weformulate corresponding measures according to different fault types. As the result of Inspection and investigation showed, the failure rate of electric forkliftreaches to 1. 3 % as the failure rate of diesel forklift is to 10. 7 %; the market share of electric forklift of test and acceptance rose from 41. 6 % to 78. 3 % compared with electric forklift of annual test. Braking deviation oflinear acceleration is the most typical fault type of forklift; electric forklift make more excellent performance than diesel forklift on key parameterssuch as braking; forward forklift easily has rollover accidents...|$|R
