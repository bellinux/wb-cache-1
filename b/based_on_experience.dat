5|$|After World War I, {{and with}} another European war looming, {{leaders from the}} {{historic}} peace churches met to strategize about how {{to cooperate with the}} government to avoid the difficulties of World War I. Holding a common view that any participation in military service was not acceptable, they devised a plan of civilian alternative service, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience</b> gained by American Friends Service Committee work in Europe during and after World War I and forestry service done by Russian Mennonites in lieu of military service in Tsarist Russia.|$|E
5|$|The Leader {{project was}} part of Bulleid's desire to modernise the steam {{locomotive}} <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience</b> gained with the Southern Railway's fleet of electric stock. Bulleid considered that attitudes towards the labour-intensity of steam operation had changed during the post-war period, favouring dieselisation and electrification. In an effort to demonstrate the continued potential of steam, Bulleid pushed forward the boundaries of steam-power, allowing it to compete with diesel and electric locomotives in terms of labour-saving and ease of operation.|$|E
5|$|The last pair of {{protected}} cruisers {{built by the}} Italian Navy was intended for colonial service, and were <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience</b> from Calabria. They were given a relatively heavy main battery for their small size and a long cruising range, {{at the expense of}} armor protection and speed. The ships were so small that they could be built on the same slipway and launched the same day. Since they had been launched less than a week before hostilities broke {{out at the end of}} July 1914, fitting-out work was delayed by a steel shortage, particularly after Italy entered the war. Campania and Basilicata initially served in Libya; neither had eventful careers. The latter vessel was destroyed by a boiler explosion in Tewfik on 13 August 1919. Campania was reclassified as a gunboat in 1921 and became a training ship in 1932. She ultimately was sold for scrap in 1937.|$|E

25|$|After Locke, {{constructive}} deism {{could no}} longer appeal to innate ideas for justification of its basic tenets such as the existence of God.

The prognosis also differs depending upon different causes and factors affecting the individual. An overall mortality rate of 25 percent exists due to possible respiratory paralysis of persons with post-polio syndrome; otherwise, post-polio syndrome is usually non-lethal.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of the vertical steam generating bank {{is similar to the}} vertical economizer, which <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience</b> is very easy to keep clean. Vertical flue gas flow path improves the cleanability with high dust loading. To minimize the risk for plugging and maximize the efficiency of cleaning both the generating bank and the economizers are arranged on generous side spacing. Plugging of a two drum boiler bank is often caused by the tight spacing between the tubes.|$|E

25|$|The {{prototype}} B-47's long, {{swept wing}} {{was prone to}} twisting during roll maneuvers which caused a dangerous behavior known as aileron reversal to occur at airspeeds lower than expected. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience</b> with earlier aircraft, Townsend proposed the use of spoiler ailerons on the B-47 to reduce this unwanted behavior. The use of spoiler ailerons to reduce wing twisting was first tested on the B-47, and although not used on production B-47s, became standard issue for lateral control on many later jets.|$|E
25|$|In , Harris {{writes that}} the purpose of spirituality (as he defines it – he concedes that the term's uses are diverse and {{sometimes}} indefensible) is to become aware that our sense of self is illusory, and says this realization brings both happiness and insight into the nature of consciousness. He argues this process of realization is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience</b> and is not contingent on faith. In the same book, he describes his experience with Dzogchen, a Tibetan Buddhist meditation practice, and recommends it to his readers.|$|E

25|$|The {{publication}} of John Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1689, but dated 1690) marks a major {{turning point in}} the history of deism. Since Herbert's De Veritate, innate ideas had been the foundation of deist epistemology. Locke's famous attack on innate ideas in the first book of the Essay effectively destroyed that foundation and replaced it with a theory of knowledge <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience.</b> Innatist deism was replaced by empiricist deism. Locke himself was not a deist. He believed in both miracles and revelation, and he regarded miracles as the main proof of revelation.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of the earthquake, Mexico City had one of the most {{stringent}} building codes, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience</b> gained from earthquakes in 1957 and 1979. However, the codes were not designed for seismic activity of the intensity experienced in 1985. The event {{was one of the most}} intense of any recorded in the world, allowing for macroseismic waves to arrive in the Valley of Mexico with unusually high energy content. Prior to the event, estimates about ground movement on the lakebed were generally accepted and a number of buildings were built on these estimates.|$|E
25|$|<b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>experience</b> {{with their}} BMW, Schnitzer Motorsport {{developed}} a Toyota Celica LB Turbo for Ertl in 1977. Schnitzer switched back to BMW for the 1978 season, retaining the services for Ertl. This move {{made him one}} of the main contenders for the title. With the Kremer Racing Porsche of Bob Wollek being bit off the pace, while the Ford entrant, Zakspeed’s Escort being outdated, and their Ford Capri Turbo was unreliable. Ertl would win five of the 11 races during the season, with a second place at the season finale, a Super Sprint event at the Nürburgring, he would win the championship.|$|E
