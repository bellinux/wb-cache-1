5|$|Copenhagen has a {{significant}} jazz scene that has existed for many years. It developed when a number of American jazz musicians such as Ben Webster, Thad Jones, Richard Boone, Ernie Wilkins, Kenny Drew, Ed Thigpen, Bob Rockwell, Dexter Gordon, and others such as rock guitarist Link Wray came to live in Copenhagen during the 1960s. Every year in early July, Copenhagen's streets, squares, parks as well as cafés and concert halls fill up with <b>big</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> jazz concerts during the Copenhagen Jazz Festival. One of Europe's top jazz festivals, the annual event features around 900 concerts at 100 venues with over 200,000 guests from Denmark and around the world.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th and 7th centuries, {{the first}} devotional hymns {{were created in}} the Tamil language. They were imitated all over India and led to both the {{resurgence}} of Hinduism {{and the development of}} all modern languages of the subcontinent. Indian royalty, <b>big</b> <b>and</b> <b>small,</b> and the temples they patronised, drew citizens in great numbers to the capital cities, which became economic hubs as well. Temple towns of various sizes began to appear everywhere as India underwent another urbanisation. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the effects were felt in South-East Asia, as South Indian culture and political systems were exported to lands that became part of modern-day Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, and Java. Indian merchants, scholars, and sometimes armies were involved in this transmission; South-East Asians took the initiative as well, with many sojourning in Indian seminaries and translating Buddhist and Hindu texts into their languages.|$|E

25|$|Under Grand Duke Vasili III, who {{personally}} {{loved the}} huntings for hare, {{there were over}} one hundred chasseurs who dealt particularly with wolves and foxes. The court hunt of that time embraced the chasseurs with hounds (выжлятники), their head (доезжачий), borzoi hunters (борзятники), dog-breeders and beaters.

25|$|Lead glass also {{occurs in}} Han-period China (206 BC – 220 AD). There, it was cast to imitate jade, both for ritual {{objects such as}} <b>big</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> figures, as well as {{jewellery}} and a limited range of vessels. Since glass first occurs at such a late date in China, {{it is thought that}} the technology was brought along the Silk Road by glassworkers from the Middle East. The fundamental compositional difference between Western silica-natron glass and the unique Chinese lead glass, however, may indicate an autonomous development.|$|E
25|$|First {{proposed}} by Trier in the 1930s, semantic field theory proposes {{that a group}} of words with interrelated meanings can be categorized under a larger conceptual domain. This entire entity is thereby known as a semantic field. The words boil, bake, fry, and roast, for example, would fall under the larger semantic category of cooking. Semantic field theory asserts that lexical meaning cannot be fully understood by looking at a word in isolation, but by looking at a group of semantically related words. Semantic relations can refer to any relationship in meaning between lexemes, including synonymy (big and large), antonymy (<b>big</b> <b>and</b> <b>small),</b> hypernymy and hyponymy (rose and flower), converseness (buy and sell), and incompatibility. Semantic field theory does not have concrete guidelines that determine the extent of semantic relations between lexemes. The abstract validity of the theory is a subject of debate.|$|E

500|$|Crime {{has been}} a {{lingering}} problem {{in many of the}} Rust Belt's <b>big</b> <b>and</b> <b>small</b> urban communities, hampering economic recovery. In the late 1950s and early 1960s, Youngstown was nationally identified with gangland slayings that were often committed with car bombs. The town gained the nicknames [...] "Murdertown, USA" [...] and [...] "Bomb City, USA," [...] while the phrase [...] "Youngstown tune-up" [...] became a nationally popular slang term for car-bomb assassination. The image of Youngstown's association with crime was reinforced by the construction of prisons inside the metropolitan area. As of 2012, three adult correctional facilities continue to operate within city limits: the Mahoning County Justice Center the Northeast Ohio Correctional Center, and the Ohio State Penitentiary.|$|E
