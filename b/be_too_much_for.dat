5|$|In 1951, Soedjatmoko {{moved to}} Washington D.C. to {{establish}} the political desk at the Indonesian embassy there; he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN. This busy schedule, demanding a commute between three cities, proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> him and {{he dropped out of}} the Littauer Center. In late 1951, he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months, seeking political inspiration. In Yugoslavia, he met Milovan Djilas, who impressed him greatly.|$|E
5|$|In the 2003–04 season, Brodeur won {{his second}} {{consecutive}} Vezina Trophy and Jennings Trophy. He {{was a first}} Team All-Star, a starter in the NHL All-Star Game, and {{a finalist for the}} Hart Trophy again. The Devils lost the Atlantic Division title by 1 point to the Philadelphia Flyers, who thus obtained the third seed and home ice advantage against the sixth-seeded Devils {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. This would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Brodeur and the Devils to overcome, as the Flyers went on to defeat them in five games.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, the Kentucky House {{achieved}} a quorum, and the Senate did so the following day. Having lost {{the battle against}} the special session, Laffoon proposed a primary with a run-off if no candidate received a majority on the first ballot. Some, including Chandler, believed this action was aimed against former governor and senator J. C. W. Beckham, who Laffoon believed would challenge Rhea for the Democratic nomination. They believed that a double primary would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the aging Beckham to endure. Supporters of a single primary found {{they did not have}} the votes in the legislature to pass it, so they agreed to a double primary, which Laffoon signed into law on February 27, 1935.|$|E

5|$|In Cú Chulainn's youth {{he is so}} {{beautiful}} the Ulstermen worry that, without a wife of his own, he will steal their wives and ruin their daughters. They search all over Ireland for a suitable wife for him, but he will have none but Emer, daughter of Forgall Monach. However, Forgall is opposed to the match. He suggests that Cú Chulainn should train in arms with the renowned warrior-woman Scáthach {{in the land of}} Alba (Scotland), hoping the ordeal will <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> him and he will be killed. Cú Chulainn takes up the challenge, travelling to her residence Dún Scáith (Fortress of Shadows) on the Isle of Skye. In the meantime, Forgall offers Emer to Lugaid mac Nóis, a king of Munster, but when he hears that Emer loves Cú Chulainn, Lugaid refuses her hand.|$|E
5|$|Yotsuba goes to an udon shop {{without her}} father's knowledge, and {{is allowed to}} watch udon being made. After getting a pizza menu in the mail, the Koiwais order a couple, though one turns out to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Yotsuba to hold. After an {{announcement}} of an upcoming camping trip, Yanda arrives with various bubble-blowing devices, which they play inside, then outside, with. Yotsuba, Fuka, and Fuka's classmate from chapter 45 go to a shrine to pick chestnuts, and Yotsuba learns about burr covers and bug infestations. Koiwai gives Yotsuba her own camera, which she uses to go around taking pictures of people. Yotsuba meets Miura at her apartment building, and they go to Ena's. On the way, a dog grabs her teddy bear and shakes it, making it smell like dog, so they wash it and dry it at the Ayases'. As a result, the bear's ability to speak is broken, so Asagi offers to repair it overnight. Yotsuba spends much of the intervening time sulking about Juralumin's absence until Yanda finally gets a reaction out of her. She goes to the Ayases', where she finds Juralumin repaired.|$|E

25|$|The {{spotlight}} {{would prove}} to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Vandenberg, as he could never mount an effective enough drive to overcome the suddenly mounting score. Iowa would eventually lose the game and their number 4 ranking in the BCS poll.|$|E
25|$|T68 – Perhaps {{the most}} radical of the experiments, the T68 {{featured}} two 40mm cannons, one mounted {{on top of the}} other, plus a stabilizer on top of the two guns. The recoil force proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the mount, and the idea was abandoned. Prototype only.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of the blockhouses, sweeper operations and concentration camps proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the Boers. In 1902, the war ended {{as the last of}} the Boer commandos surrendered and the Treaty of Vereeniging was signed. With the war over, the 2nd Wiltshires returned to the England in 1903.|$|E

25|$|Shortly after Matt’s departure, local drummer Tim Olsen {{was brought}} in as a replacement. Also around that time, Marc-André Mongeon was brought as a bassist (the first since Shomir had left the band in 2001). As a five-piece, the band toured {{throughout}} the summer of 2004 across Canada. By the time mid-2005 came around, the constant touring proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Marc and Dave {{and they decided to}} step down.|$|E
25|$|Jeffress {{joined the}} Acoustical Society of America in 1939 and was elected a fellow in 1948. He served the ASA {{for eight years}} as {{associate}} editor of psychological acoustics beginning in 1962. This was among the longest terms of service for any associate editor, {{and it was the}} longest for an associate editor in psychological and physiological acoustics. Upon Jeffress' retirement as associate editor, the job was re-examined and found to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> one person, and two subsections were formed with an associate editor for each.|$|E

25|$|Things {{began to}} look up for the Centennials in the 1995–96 season as the team jumped to 26 wins and third place in the Interior Division. Buoyed by the offence of John Coyle and Bryan Phillips, who {{finished}} sixth and eighth respectively in BCJHL scoring, the Centennials returned to the playoffs with a first round miniseries against the South Surrey Eagles. Merritt eliminated the Eagles 2–0 {{in the best of}} three series and advanced to the league quarterfinals, where it would face the Chilliwack Chiefs. The Chiefs proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the Cents, as they beat Merritt in five games.|$|E
25|$|When Anne-Thérèse was 15, tragedy {{struck the}} family {{when her father}} was killed by bandits as he {{traveled}} home to his family. The grief proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> her mother, who already had lost two children, and she {{fell into a deep}} and incapacitating depression. For many years, Anne-Thérèse accepted the responsibility of caring for her mother and sister, as well as the family's home and garden. At the age of 20, Anne-Thérèse asked her mother's blessing to join a religious order, but Isabelle — still unable to cope with her loss — refused. Five years later, Isabelle recognized the depth of Anne-Thérèse's devotion and permitted her to leave.|$|E
25|$|In the 1850s, a steam mill {{was erected}} {{close to the}} smock mill. It was powered by a beam engine and drove two pairs of millstones. a third pair was added at a later date, along with other {{machines}} for cleaning grain and dressing flour. This proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the beam engine {{with the result that}} the beam broke and the engine was wrecked. The mill was worked by the Clover family until 1860 when it was dismantled. The machinery, cap and sails from the smock mill were incorporated into the new tower mill. Work started on 8 May 1860 and was completed in February 1861.|$|E

25|$|This {{required}} the Steadicam {{to be on}} a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were then mounted on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.|$|E
25|$|Two {{years prior}} to the Hawker Henley's arrival (Summer 1941) a Supermarine Spitfire Mk II, P7674 had been {{delivered}} to Hucknall and was fitted with a Crecy mock-up to enable cowling drawings and system details to be designed. It had been agreed that the first production Spitfire Mk III would be delivered to Hucknall in early 1942 minus its Merlin engine for fitment of an airworthy Crecy, but this delivery did not occur. A Royal Aircraft Establishment report (No. E.3932) of March 1942 estimated the performance of the Spitfire fitted with a Crecy engine and compared this to a Griffon 61-powered variant. The report stated that the Crecy's maximum power output would <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the Spitfire airframe but that a derated version would have considerable performance gains over the Griffon-powered fighter.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Jim's {{locomotive}} Molly, whom Jim and Luke {{had left}} at the cliffs when getting Mr. Tur Tur and Nepomuk, has been abducted by the band of pirates called the Wild 13. Luckily for Jim and Luke, the former Mrs. Grindtooth awakes as a Golden Dragon of Wisdom in China and can help them out with information and tells Jim how {{to find out about}} his origin. With the help of the Mandalanese emperor, Jim and Luke – and Princess Li Si as a stowaway – start their journey to meet the Wild 13 and rescue Molly. They encounter the pirates, who prove to <b>be</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> them in battle. Molly is lost at sea, and all but Jim are captured and brought to the pirates' base, Castle Stormeye, a pinnacle of rock within the eye of a perpetual hurricane.|$|E
