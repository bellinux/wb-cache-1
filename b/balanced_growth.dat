5|$|Nurkse and Paul Rosenstein-Rodan {{were the}} pioneers of <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> theory and much of how it is {{understood}} today dates back to their work.|$|E
5|$|Hans Singer {{asserted}} that the <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> theory is more applicable to cure an economy facing a cyclical downswing. Cyclical downswing is a feature of an advanced stage of sustained growth rather than of the vicious cycle of poverty.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. It entails the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E

On the other hand, the economy has <b>balance</b> <b>growth</b> path for given individual years of schooling.

40|$|This project proposes {{an urban}} design {{strategy}} for the North End of downtown Sacramento, California; the culmination {{of which is the}} design for a new intermodal transit facility. The intention is to recapture development into downtown by reclaiming the former Southern Pacific Railyard site, and propose a formal and programmatic development strategy allowing Sacramento to <b>balance</b> downtown <b>growth</b> through renewed connections into its North End. Conceptually this occurs at three scales: City, District, and Architectural, represented by the three scales of site. The entire 240 acre rail yard site will <b>balance</b> <b>growth</b> at the scale of downtown; the smaller 45 acre transit district will <b>balance</b> <b>growth</b> between the central business district and a new activity district in the North End; and finally the transit facility will itself act as a bridge across the tracks allowing for direct communication between the new and the old city fabrics...|$|R
5|$|Ragnar Nurkse's <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> theory too {{has been}} criticised {{on a number}} of grounds. His main critic was Albert O. Hirschman, the pioneer of the {{strategy}} of unbalanced growth. Hans W. Singer also criticised certain aspects of the theory.|$|E
5|$|Nurkse was {{in favour}} of {{attaining}} <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> in both the industrial and agricultural sectors of the economy. He recognised that the expansion and inter-sectoral balance between agriculture and manufacturing is necessary so {{that each of these}} sectors provides a market for the products of the other and in turn, supplies the necessary raw materials for the development and growth of the other.|$|E
5|$|The <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> {{theory is}} an {{economic}} theory pioneered by the economist Ragnar Nurkse (1907–1959). The theory hypothesises {{that the government of}} any underdeveloped country needs to make large investments in a number of industries simultaneously. This will enlarge the market size, increase productivity, and provide an incentive for the private sector to invest.|$|E

5|$|After World War II, {{a debate}} about whether a country should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse believed that the subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|Most of Sikkim, {{including}} Gangtok, is underlain by Precambrian rocks {{which contains}} foliated phyllites and schists; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides. Surface runoff of water by natural streams (jhora) and man-made drains {{has contributed to}} the risk of landslides. According to the Bureau of Indian Standards, the town falls under seismic zone-IV (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the convergent boundary of the Indian and the Eurasian tectonic plates and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount Kanchenjunga (8,598m or 28,208ft)—the world's third-highest peak—is visible {{to the west of the}} city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> of the city.|$|E

25|$|Historians, James Huston notes, {{have been}} baffled by {{the role of}} high tariffs in general and have offered {{multiple}} conflicting interpretations over the years. (Low tariffs, all historians agree, were noncontroversial and were needed to fund the federal government.) One school of thought says the Republicans were the willing tools of would-be monopolists. A second schools says the Republicans truly believed tariffs would promote nationalism and prosperity for everyone along with <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> in every region (as opposed to growth only in the cotton South). A third school emphasizes the undeniable importance of the tariff in cementing party loyalty, especially in industrial states. Another approach emphasizes that factory workers were eager for high tariffs because it protected their high wages from European competition.|$|E
25|$|Vice Premier Wang Qishan said in {{his speech}} that History and reality both have shown and future will {{ultimately}} prove that no difficulty can ever stop the trend of cooperation between China and the US, {{in which we are}} full of confidence. Such confidence comes from the wide common interest between the two countries, from the common aspiration of the Chinese and the US people and from historic and philosophic thoughts. The two sides should take the opportunity of this round of SED to carefully implement the important consensus reached between the two heads of state, comprehensively deepen cooperation in the fields of trade and economy, investment, finance and infrastructure and boost the strong, sustained and <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> of their own economy and the world economy at large.|$|E

The dynamics of market hours are driven by substitutions between home and market production and depend critically on the existence of many market sectors.

2500|$|Chapter 8 sums up Keynes's {{relevance}} to the current age as of 2009. [...] The author suggests that Keynes would likely advise us to rethink macroeconomic policy, with {{a greater emphasis on}} <b>balanced</b> <b>growth</b> and with a somewhat large role for government in ensuring there is a smooth flow of investment to help protect the economy from unpredictable shocks. Macroeconomics should be reformed so that it again recognises the role of uncertainty and so it draws on other areas of knowledge such as history and International political economy, with a less central role for maths. The global savings glut needs to be addressed. [...] Ethics should once again have a role in guiding capitalism, as should Keynes's vision of harmony, where differences are cherished rather than pressured to conform, as can be the case with current concepts of [...] "social cohesion" [...] and [...] "consensus".|$|E
2500|$|Between {{the time}} of the 13th National Congress and the Tiananmen Square {{incident}} and the ensuing crackdown, the line between right and left within the CPC became clearer. The rift became visible {{in the run-up to the}} 7th plenum of the 13th National Congress (in 1990), when problems arose concerning China's 8th Five-Year Plan. The draft for the 8th Five-Year Plan, supervised by Premier Li Peng and Deputy Premier Yao Yilin, openly endorsed Chen Yun's economic view that planning should be primary, coupled with slow, <b>balanced</b> <b>growth.</b> Li went further and directly contradicted Deng, stating, [...] "Reform and opening up should not be taken as the guiding principle; instead, sustained, steady, and coordinated development should be taken as the guiding principle." [...] Deng retaliated by rejecting the Draft for the 8th Five-Year Plan, claiming that the 1990s was the [...] "best time" [...] for continuing with reform and opening up. Li and Yao even went so far as to try to annul two key resolutions passed by the 13th National Congress: the theory of socialist political civilization, and the resolution that central planning and markets were equals. Deng rejected the idea of reopening discussions on these subjects, and restated that reforms were essential for the CPC's future. Not accepting Deng's stance, party theorist Deng Liqun, along with others, began promoting [...] "Chen Yun Thought". After a discussion with General Wang Zhen, a supporter of Chen Yun, Deng stated he would propose the abolishment of the Central Advisory Commission (CAC). Chen Yun retaliated by naming Bo Yibo to succeed him as CAC chairman. Indeed, when the 7th plenum of the 13th Central Committee did in fact convene, nothing notable took place, with both sides trying not to widen the ideological gap even further. The resolution of the 7th plenum did contain a great deal of ideological language ("firmly follow the road of socialism with Chinese characteristics"), but no clear formulation of new policy was uttered.|$|E

Specifically, our model suggests that more elitist societies and societies with higher wage differentials may do better in terms of growth but worse in terms of welfare. ...|$|R
