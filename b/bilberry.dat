5|$|About 190 {{species of}} {{flowering}} {{plants in the}} park have been registered, {{most of which are}} part of the natural composition of the Siberian taiga. Marsh Labrador tea is the most common, the park being one of only three locations in Norway where it occurs. The most common berry plant is lingonberry; common <b>bilberry</b> and bog <b>bilberry</b> are also common, but do not carry good yields of berries. In August there is normally a good yield of cloudberry, and occasionally there can be found Arctic raspberry. There is a limited number of marine plants. The steep cliffs at Revsaksskaret allow mountainous plants to thrive, such as Alpine chickweed, white bluegrass and brittle bladder-fern. These were common throughout the area after the last glacial period, but have vanished with forestation. Other mountainous plants common in the region are not found in Pasvik because of low oxygen levels in the lower soil levels.|$|E
5|$|On {{the steep}} grassy slopes above the River Avon, Bristol rockcress (Arabis scabra) which {{is unique to}} the Avon Gorge can be seen {{flowering}} in April; orchids and western spiked speedwell (Veronica spicata) are common in June and July. In autumn the woodland hosts over 300 species of fungi. <b>Bilberry,</b> a scarce plant in the Bristol area, is found in Leigh Woods, as is the parasitic plant yellow bird's-nest (Monotropa hypopitys). Lady orchid (Orchis purpurea) was discovered here in 1990, in Nightingale Valley; there is doubt as to whether this was a wild plant or an introduction. Green-flowered Helleborine (Epipactis phyllanthes) is found {{on the western side}} of the gorge, in a wooded area next to the towpath below Leigh Woods.|$|E
5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), <b>bilberry</b> (Vaccinium myrtillus) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
50|$|Cyanococcus {{blueberries}} can {{be distinguished}} from the nearly identical-looking <b>bilberries</b> by their flesh color when cut in half. Ripe blueberries have light green flesh, while <b>bilberries,</b> whortleberries and huckleberries are red or purple throughout.|$|R

25|$|The Swedish {{tradition}} dates {{at least}} to the 15th century, and there is even a particular day for the purpose, Våffeldagen (waffle day), which sounds like Vårfrudagen ("Our Lady's Day"), and is therefore used for the purpose. This is March 25 (nine months before Christmas), the Christian holiday of Annunciation. They are usually topped with strawberry jam, <b>bilberry</b> jam, hjortron jam, raspberry jam, <b>bilberry</b> and raspberry jam, sugar and butter, vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Other, savory, toppings include salmon roe, cold-smoked salmon and cream fraiche.|$|E
25|$|Over {{most of the}} area, {{the habitat}} is heathland, in which the {{dominant}} species is ling, Calluna vulgaris, except on shallower soils, where <b>bilberry,</b> Vaccinium myrtillus, and, to a lesser extent, crowberry, Empetrum nigrum, are dominant.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Low-grade {{metabolic}} {{inflammation and}} hypertension are primary mechanisms involved in obesity-associated adverse health effects. Berries, especially Nordic wild blueberries (hereafter {{referred to as}} <b>bilberries),</b> represent {{an important source of}} dietary anthocyanins, a group of polyphenols with potential beneficial effects to combat obesity-associated metabolic disturbances. METHODS: The effects of 5 % or 10 % (w/w) of whole <b>bilberries</b> (BB) were studied on the development of obesity and its metabolic disturbances in C 57 BL mice fed with a high-fat diet (HFD) for three months. Cytokines, inflammatory cells, systolic blood pressure, glucose tolerance, insulin sensitivity, weight gain, body fat, food consumption and energy metabolism were assessed. RESULTS: <b>Bilberries</b> ameliorated type 1 pro-inflammatory responsiveness induced by HFD. This was indicated by the altered cytokine profile and the reduced prevalence of interferon gamma -producing T-cells, in particular T helper type 1 cells. <b>Bilberries</b> also prevented the progression of obesity associated long term increase in systolic blood pressure in mice. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Bilberries</b> reduce the development of systemic inflammation and prevent the progression of chronic hypertension, thus supporting their potential role in alleviating the adverse health effects associated with developing obesity...|$|R
25|$|Foods {{are known}} to alter the epigenetics of rats on {{different}} diets. Some food components epigenetically increase the levels of DNA repair enzymes such as MGMT and MLH1 and p53. Other food components can reduce DNA damage, such as soy isoflavones and <b>bilberry</b> anthocyanins.|$|E

40|$|Cell wall polysaccharides {{from black}} {{currants}} and <b>bilberries</b> were characterised in three approaches. First, compositions of skin, pulp, and seeds show {{the distribution of}} polysaccharides over these tissues. A sequential extraction of cell wall material with different aqueous extractants informs about the extractability of the different polysaccharides, viz. pectins, hemicellulose, and cellulose. Finally, by isolation of cell wall polysaccharides from juice and press cakes obtained by the conventional juice manufacturing. The polysaccharide distribution was followed during juice processing. The main difference between <b>bilberries</b> and black currants is the dominant sugar residue in seeds: mannose for black currants and xylose for <b>bilberries.</b> Most of the hemicellulolytic sugars and cellulose can be found back in the press cake. The sugar composition of the press cake {{is similar to the}} composition of the residue after sequential extraction.

25|$|Pine forests (with Pinus sylvestris) are {{the most}} {{widespread}} and occupy 51% of the forested area of the Karelian Isthmus, followed by spruce forests (with Picea abies, 29%) and birch forests (with Betula pendula and B. pubescens, 16%). Stands on more fertile soils and in more favorable locations are occasionally dominated by Norway maple, black alder, grey alder, common aspen, English oak, grey willow, dark-leaved willow, tea-leaved willow, small-leaved lime or European white elm. Common vegetation of various types of pine forests includes heather, crowberry, common juniper, eared willow, lingonberry, water horsetail, bracken, graminoids (i.e. grasses in the wider sense) Avenella flexuosa and Carex globularis, mosses Pleurozium schreberi, Sphagnum angustifolium and S. russowii, and lichens Cladonia spp. Prominent in various spruce forests are wood horsetail, common wood sorrel, <b>bilberry,</b> lingonberry, graminoids Avenella flexuosa, Calamagrostis arundinacea, Carex globularis, and mosses Polytrichum commune and Sphagnum girgensohnii.
