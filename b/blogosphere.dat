5|$|In 2009 McNallen {{was invited}} to the International Asatru Summer Camp, but this was opposed {{by many of the}} groups attending, who argued that he should not be invited because of what they {{perceived}} as his racist views; a number of European Heathen groups, such as Norway's Bifrost and the Swedish SAS, threatened to boycott the event as a result of McNallen's invite. In 2011, the AFA sent a contingent to the annual conference of a white nationalist organization, the National Policy Institute, in what some figures close to McNallen revealed was an attempt to recruit members. After this incident was publicized it resulted in accusations of racism being levelled against McNallen and the AFA from various parts of the Pagan <b>blogosphere.</b>|$|E

The pilot was critically acclaimed and viewed by over 12million people, but Studio 60 experienced a significant drop in audience by mid-season. The seething anticipation {{that preceded the}} début was followed up by {{a large amount of}} thoughtful and scrupulous criticism in the press, as well as largely negative analysis in the <b>blogosphere.</b> In January 2007, Sorkin spoke out against the press for focusing too heavily on the ratings slide and for using blogs and unemployed comedy writers as sources. After two months on hiatus, Studio 60 resumed to air the last episodes of season one, which would be its only season.|$|E

At the Britannica Blog, a part of the discussion focused on the apparent bias in Carr's argument toward literary reading. In Carr's view, reading on the Internet is generally a shallower form in comparison with reading from printed books in which he believes a more intense and sustained form of reading is exercised. Elsewhere in the media, the Internet's impact on memory retention was discussed; and, at the online scientific magazine Edge, several argued that it was ultimately the responsibility of individuals to monitor their Internet usage so that it does not impact their cognition.|$|E
5|$|The {{response}} to the riots on the Chinese <b>blogosphere</b> was markedly more varied than the official response. Despite blocks and censorship, Internet watchers monitored continued attempts by netizens to publish their own thoughts on {{the causes of the}} incident or vent their anger about the violence. While some bloggers were supportive of the government, others were more reflective of the event's cause. On numerous forums and news sites, government workers quickly removed comments about the riots. Common themes were calls for punishment for those responsible; some posts evoked the name of Wang Zhen, the general who is respected by Hans and other minorities, and feared by many Uyghurs for repression after the communist takeover of Xinjiang in 1949.|$|E
5|$|Much {{support has}} been {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, <b>blogosphere,</b> and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. Former CEO of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E
40|$|Blogs {{are popular}} {{way to express}} {{opinions}} on the Internet. Due to their popularity and their public character blogs attract attention of many researchers. In this paper we compare two national <b>blogospheres</b> (Polish and American) from different angles such as characteristics of messages and interactions, structure of social groups, topics discussed in them, {{and the influence of}} real-world events on the behavior of such groups. In our approach we try to combine in advanced manner users activity on both the individual and community level. The comparison reveals some differences and various characters of both portals.

40|$|Abstract: A {{discrete}} time {{dynamic model}} is proposed for bursty propagation of incidental events {{based on the}} node popularity and activeness in blog networks. The parameters of this model are clearly associated with the actual propagation and can reflect {{the characteristics of the}} dynamic propagation process. The model can provide a basis for predicting the trend of social events propagation in blog networks. Numerical testing is performed with the data from widely discussed events in Sina Blog, {{one of the most popular}} <b>blogospheres</b> in China in several months, and the results show that this model can emulate the actual event propagation and reflect the heavy tail phenomena of the decreasing propagation rate...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} study aims at detecting topics and extracting themes(subtopics) from the <b>blogosphere’s</b> content while {{bridging the gap}} between the Social Web and the Semantic Web. The goal is to detect certain types of information from collections of blogs’ and microblogs’ narratives that lack explicit semantics. The approach presented introduces a novel approach that blends together two young paradigms: Ontology-Based Information Extraction (OBIE) and Reservoir Computing (RC). The novelty of the work lies in integrating ontologies and RC as well as the pioneering use of RC with social media data. Experiments with retrospect data from blogs and Twitter microblogs provide valuable insights into the BBC Backstage initiative and prove the viability of the approach presented in terms of scalability, computational complexity,and performance...|$|R

25|$|The PageRank {{may also}} be used as a {{methodology}} to measure the apparent impact of a community like the <b>Blogosphere</b> on the overall Web itself. This approach uses therefore the PageRank to measure the distribution of attention in reflection of the Scale-free network paradigm.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{primary focus}} {{of this paper is}} to {{describe}} stable statistics of the <b>blogosphere’s</b> evolution which convey information on the social network’s dynamics. In this paper, we present a number of non-trivial statistics that are surprisingly stable and thus can be used as benchmarks to diagnose phase-transitions in the network. We believe that stable statistics can be used to identify anomalous behavior at all levels: that of a node, of a local community, or of the entire network itself. Any substantial change in those stable statistics must alert the researchers and analysts to the need for further investigation. Furthermore, the usage of these or similar statistics that are based solely on the communication dynamics and not on the communication content, allows one to diagnose anomalous behavior with minimal intrusion of privacy. ...|$|R
5000|$|A 2007 New Zealand Herald {{article by}} Bill Ralston {{described}} political bloggers as being potentially {{the most powerful}} [...] "opinion makers" [...] in New Zealand politics. A few weeks earlier the National Business Review had stated that, [...] "Any realistic 'power list' produced in this country would include either David Farrar or his fellow blogger and opinion leader Russell Brown." [...] And in 2008 The Press said that year's election [...] "could be the time when New Zealand's burgeoning political bloggers finally make their presence felt". The article saw the increasing influence of the Internet (as opposed to television and radio) on people's lives {{and the number of}} professional journalists now maintaining blogs as the reason for the <b>blogosphere's</b> increased significance, alongside the fact that unlike newspapers blogs can link directly to facts and sources.|$|R
40|$|Film {{criticism}} is in crisis. Dwelling {{on the many}} film journalists made redundant at newspapers, magazines, and other 'old media' in past years, commentators have voiced existential questions about the purpose and worth of the profession {{in the age of}} WordPress <b>blogospheres</b> and proclaimed the 'death of the critic'. Bemoaning the current anarchy of internet amateurs and the lack of authoritative critics, many journalists and academics claim that in the digital age, cultural commentary has become dumbed down and fragmented into niche markets. Mattias Freu, arguing against these claims, examines the history of film critical discourse in France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. He demonstrates that since its origins, film criticism has always found itself in crisis: the need to show critical authority and the anxieties over challenges to that authority have been longstanding concerns...|$|R

25|$|Consumer-generated {{advertising}} {{is a relatively}} new and controversial development, and it has created a new model of marketing communication from businesses to consumers. Among the various forms of advertising on blog, the most controversial are the sponsored posts. These are blog entries or posts and may be in the form of feedback, reviews, opinion, videos, etc. and usually contain a link back to the desired site using a keyword or several keywords. Blogs have led to some disintermediation and a breakdown of the traditional advertising model, where companies can skip over the advertising agencies (previously the only interface with the customer) and contact the customers directly via social media websites. On the other hand, new companies specialised in blog advertising have been established, {{to take advantage of this}} new development as well. However, there are many people who look negatively on this new development. Some believe that any form of commercial activity on blogs will destroy the <b>blogosphere’s</b> credibility.|$|R

50|$|While {{conservatism}} dominates political blogging in Canada, {{data analysis}} from Ryerson University's Infoscape Research Lab at the Centre for the Study of Social Media indicates that left of centre political blogs are gaining track. In a tool specifically created {{to visualize the}} activity levels of political bloggers by political party affiliation (NDP, Liberal, and Conservative) on a day-to-day basis, {{it is evident that}} the more left of centre partisan <b>blogospheres</b> remain equally, if not more, active in recent blogging activity. Though this data is at odds with that described in the previous paragraph, a few arguments can be made. It is possible that while conservative bloggers outnumber those who are ideologically left of centre, fewer conservative bloggers identify as partisan. Alternatively, perhaps more conservative blogs exist overall, but are accessed and posted to less frequently than the fewer left of centre political blogs. It may also be that Canada's political blogging trends are mirroring those in Australia where a long-standing conservative government has fueled the numbers of left of centre bloggers- the emergence of more centre-left blogging in Canada may be a reaction to Stephen Harper's continued governance. Popular left-leaning blog aggregates include Liblogs and the New Democrats Online (now defunct).|$|R

I'd done two EPs worth of introspection; songs that were just me and my thoughts, written and produced by me with lyrics by me. It was all a little too me-centric, and I'm not too comfortable with that. So, I wanted to have other voices in there to widen the palette."

Taking her cues from early Internet ethnographies that stress the importance of treating the Internet as both a site and product of cultural production, accounts in media studies that highlight the continuities between old and new media, and a range of works that have made critical interventions in the field of Iranian studies, Niki Akhavan traces key developments and confronts conventional wisdom about digital media in general, and contemporary Iranian culture and politics in particular. Akhavan focuses largely on the years between 1998 and 2012 to reveal a diverse and combative virtual landscape where both geographically and ideologically dispersed individuals and groups deployed Internet technologies to variously construct, defend, and challenge narratives of Iranian national identity, society, and politics. While it tempers celebratory claims that have dominated assessments of the Iranian Internet, Electronic Iran is ultimately optimistic in its outlook. As it exposes and assesses overlooked aspects of the Iranian Internet, the book sketches a more complete map of its dynamic landscape, and suggests that the transformative powers of digital media can only be developed and understood if attention is paid to both the specificities of new technologies as well as the local and transnational contexts in which they appear.
