5|$|England {{moved to}} 4/277 when a mini-collapse occurred. Yardley made seven {{before he was}} removed by Johnston, caught by a leaping Harvey while {{attempting}} a <b>big</b> <b>shot.</b> Johnston then removed Ken Cranston, caught behind for a duck to leave England at 6/278. When Johnston removed Compton for 66, caught by Miller at cover, the hosts were 7/293 with no recognised batsmen remaining, having lost 4/33. England recovered to reach 8/362 {{at the close of}} the fourth day. The next day, Yardley declared at 8/365, leaving Johnston with the pick of the bowling figures, 4/95 from 29 overs. This left the tourists a target of 404 from 345 minutes. Australia went on to break the world record Test run-chase record by scoring 3/404 to take a 30 lead with 15 minutes to spare.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{practical}} obstacles that {{stood in the}} way of the group's success, Game Theory experienced substantial turnovers of personnel after three of their five studio albums were recorded, which disrupted promotional plans and concert tours following the releases of Real Nighttime, The <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> Chronicles, and Two Steps from the Middle Ages. The release of Two Steps was said to be plagued by difficulties, which included Miller's breakup with Thayer. After Thayer left to form Hex with Steve Kilbey of The Church, LaFreniere and Gassuan also left the group. In addition, Enigma Records, which distributed Game Theory's records, folded in 1989 soon after the release of Two Steps.|$|E

25|$|High Sierra, a 1941 film {{directed}} by Raoul Walsh, had a screenplay written by Bogart's friend and drinking partner, John Huston, {{adapted from the}} novel by W. R. Burnett (Little Caesar, etc.). Both Paul Muni and George Raft turned down the lead role, giving Bogart {{the opportunity to play}} a character of some depth, although legendary director Walsh initially fought the casting of supporting player Bogart as a leading man, much preferring Raft for the part. The film was Bogart's last major film playing a gangster (only a supporting role in 1942's The <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> followed). Bogart worked well with Ida Lupino, and her relationship with him was close, provoking jealousy from Bogart's wife, Mayo.|$|E
25|$|In {{her first}} two years with Warner Bros., Farrell starred in 17 films, {{including}} Girl Missing (1933), Gambling Ship (1933), Man's Castle (1933) opposite Spencer Tracy, and Columbia Pictures' Lady for a Day (1933) by director Frank Capra. Farrell often worked on four films at once and managed to transition from one role to another effortlessly. She worked in over 20 movies between 1934 and 1936, starring in such films as Go into Your Dance (1935), Little <b>Big</b> <b>Shot</b> (1935), and High Tension (1936). She appeared with Dick Powell and Joan Blondell in the Academy Award-nominated Gold Diggers of 1935 and Gold Diggers of 1937 musical film series. Farrell was very close friends with fellow Warner Bros. actress Joan Blondell, and throughout the early 1930s, they were paired as bombshell comedy duo {{in a series of}} five Warner Bros. movies: Havana Widows (1933), Kansas City Princess (1934), Traveling Saleslady (1935), We're in the Money (1935), and Miss Pacific Fleet (1935). Farrell and Blondell co-starred in a total of nine films. Together, they came to personify the smart and sassy, wisecracking dames of '30s and '40s film.|$|E
25|$|With Australia chasing 412 to win, {{they lost}} Rogers for 10 early on, ending his record-equalling run of half-centuries, but a 78-run {{partnership}} between Warner and Smith looked to have stabilised the innings. The stand {{was broken by}} Moeen Ali in the final over before lunch, trapping Warner LBW for 52. Australia then lost Smith (33), Clarke (4) and Voges (1) in the five overs following the interval; {{in the space of}} six overs, they had fallen from 97/1 to 106/5. Haddin was next to go, caught at short midwicket by Cook for 7; the England captain parried the ball up at the first attempt, but retained his focus to cling on at the second time of asking. Watson (19) did his best to reignite the innings before being trapped LBW {{for the second time in}} the match, reducing Australia to 151/7. Johnson and Starc then shared a 72-run partnership for the eighth wicket, only for Root's off spin to find both their edges to leave the tourists 169 behind with one wicket in hand. Root was again involved in the final wicket, as Moeen Ali tempted Hazlewood into a <b>big</b> <b>shot</b> down the ground to long on, where Root was waiting to take the catch and seal victory. For his contributions primarily with the bat, but also with the ball, Root was named Man of the Match.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{the day at}} 80/0, Australia {{lost both}} Simon Katich and Shane Watson LBW in quick {{succession}} within the first five overs. Ponting and Hussey then built an impressive partnership, sharing a stand of 127 runs before Ponting was run out by a direct hit from Andrew Flintoff fielding at mid-off, which marked an important {{turning point in the}} match. Michael Clarke was then run out in the very next over following some sharp fielding from Andrew Strauss at slip, while Marcus North was next to go when he left his ground to reach for a Greame Swann delivery but missed, allowing keeper Matt Prior to stump him before he could get back. Hussey and Haddin steadied the innings as Hussey reached his first century in 28 Test innings after earlier being dropped by Paul Collingwood on 55, but Haddin was eventually out for 34 attempting a <b>big</b> <b>shot</b> over mid-wicket, where he was caught in the deep by Strauss. Harmison took the wicket of Mitchell Johnson for a duck in the next over, and then removed Siddle and Clark in consecutive balls. Hilfenhaus survived the hat-trick ball, but the match only lasted another two overs as Hussey was caught by Cook at short leg off the bowling of Swann. England won the match by 197 runs, to claim a 2–1 series win.|$|E
25|$|During the {{continued}} playoff drought, {{instability in the}} front office mirrored the Islanders' substandard performance on the ice. Pickett sold the team to Dallas businessman John Spano in 1996. However, three months after the 1997 closing, Spano had only paid Pickett a fraction of the first installment on the cable rights deal. Several Islanders executives tipped off Newsday that something was amiss about their new boss. In July, Newsday exposed Spano as a fraud who did not have the assets required to complete the deal. The investigation showed that Spano had deliberately misled the NHL and the Islanders about his net worth, and also had two lawsuits pending against him. Within days of the report, Spano was forced to relinquish the team to Pickett. Federal prosecutors turned up evidence that Spano had forged many of the documents used to vouch for his wealth and to promise payment to Pickett, and even appeared to have sent many of the documents from his own office in Dallas. He was sentenced to 71 months in prison for bank and wire fraud. The NHL took additional heat when reports surfaced that the league spent well under $1,000 (depending on the source, the league spent either $525 or $750) to check Spano's background. It subsequently stiffened the process for vetting future owners. The incident and its aftermath were covered in the ESPN 30 for 30 documentary, <b>Big</b> <b>Shot.</b> Pickett finally found a buyer, a group led by Howard Milstein and Phoenix Coyotes co-owner Steven Gluckstern, a deal which almost fell through when Spectacor Management Group, which managed the Coliseum for Nassau County, tried to force Pickett to certify that the Coliseum was safe. Pickett refused, since the Coliseum had fallen into disrepair in recent seasons. SMG backed down under pressure from the Islanders, the NHL, and Nassau County officials.|$|E
25|$|During the 1930s, Kelly {{would appear}} in {{numerous}} films, mostly in uncredited smaller roles. In 1933 {{he would have a}} small role in Morning Glory, for which Katharine Hepburn won her first Oscar; as well as having another small role in Raoul Walsh's The Bowery, which starred Wallace Beery, George Raft, and Jackie Cooper. In 1934 he would have a featured role as Canvas Back in Shirley Temple's starring debut, Little Miss Marker. He would follow this up the same year as one of Eddie Cantor's stepbrothers in Kid Millions, and then appear in the featured role of Chuck in Lambert Hillyer's 1934 police drama, Men of the Night. Kelly had a small part in the 1935 romantic comedy We're in the Money, starring Joan Blondell and Glenda Farrell, followed by another small role in Public Hero No. 1, a 1935 crime drama starring Lionel Barrymore and Jean Arthur. In 1936 he would play the famous boxer, John L. Sullivan in a featured role in Irving Pichel's drama, The Gentleman from Louisiana (1936). Later in 1936 he would reunite with Shirley Temple in the supporting role of Ferguson in 1936's Poor Little Rich Girl. Later that year he {{would appear in}} the role of Harold in the 1936 detective comedy After the Thin Man, starring William Powell and Myrna Loy. Kelly would finish out 1936 with two featured roles: that of Rusty in the comedy Polo Joe, starring Joe E. Brown, and as Kid Couch in the 1936 drama Fugitive in the Sky. 1937 saw Kelly in the featured role of Maxie in the comedy, Angel's Holiday, followed by his featured role as Deuces in the 1937 crime film, The <b>Big</b> <b>Shot,</b> starring Guy Kibbee. Kelly would close out the decade appearing in almost a dozen films. These would include the featured role of the simple-minded policeman Elmer in the screwball comedy classic, Bringing Up Baby (1938), starring Hepburn and Cary Grant, as Butch in the 1939 comedy, Sudden Money, starring Charlie Ruggles, and as John Cass in the first of the Dr. Christian films, Meet Dr. Christian, starring Jean Hersholt.|$|E

500|$|The {{original}} Star Trek cast—who {{had agreed}} {{to appear in the}} new movie, with contracts as-yet unsigned pending script approval—grew anxious about the constant delays, and pragmatically accepted other acting offers while Roddenberry worked with Paramount. The studio decided to turn the project over to the television division, reasoning that since the roots of the franchise lay in television the writers would be able to develop the right script. A number of screenwriters offered up ideas that were summarily rejected. As Paramount executives' interest in the film began to wane, Roddenberry, backed by fan letters, applied pressure to the studio. In June 1976, Paramount assigned Jerry Isenberg, a young and active producer, to be executive producer of the project, with the budget expanded to $8 million. Povill was tasked with finding more writers to develop a script. His list included Edward Anhalt, James Goldman, Francis Ford Coppola, George Lucas, Ernest Lehman and Robert Bloch. To cap off his list, Povill put as his last recommendation [...] "Jon Povill—almost credit: Star Trek II story (with Roddenberry). Will be a <b>big</b> <b>shot</b> some day. Should be hired now while he is cheap and humble." [...] The end result was a compiled list of 34 names, none of whom were ever chosen to pen the script. Finally, British screenwriters Chris Bryant and Allan Scott, who had penned the Donald Sutherland thriller Don't Look Now were hired to write a script. Bryant believed he earned the screenwriting assignment because his view of Kirk resembled what Roddenberry modeled him on; [...] "one of Horatio Nelson's captains in the South Pacific, six months away from home and three months away by communication". Povill also wrote up a list of possible directors, including Coppola, Steven Spielberg, Lucas and Robert Wise, but all were busy at the time (or were not willing to work on the small script money budget). Philip Kaufman signed on to direct and was given a crash course in the series. Roddenberry screened ten episodes from the original series for Kaufman, including the most representative of the show and those he considered most popular: [...] "The City on the Edge of Forever", [...] "The Devil in the Dark", [...] "Amok Time", [...] "Journey to Babel", [...] "", [...] "The Trouble with Tribbles", [...] "", [...] "The Corbomite Maneuver", [...] "" [...] and [...] "". Early work was promising and, by the fall of 1976, the project was building momentum.|$|E
