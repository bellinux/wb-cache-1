5|$|The oil-fired Turkey Point power {{stations}} were completed in 1967–68 and experienced immediate problems from {{the discharge of}} hot cooling water into Biscayne Bay, where the heat killed marine grasses.

Because of the shallowness of Biscayne Bay, the {{power stations}} were projected to consume {{a significant proportion of}} the bay's waters each day for cooling. After extensive negotiations and litigation with <b>both</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> and with Ludwig, who owned lands needed for cooling water canals, a closed-loop canal system was built south of the power plants and the nuclear units became operational in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In Stevenson's first {{message to}} the legislature, he called on legislators to finally decide whether the state capital would remain at Frankfort or be moved to Lexington or Louisville, as some had wanted.

He laid out a vision for an addition to the capitol that would make it more spacious and more grandiose. To pay for the expansion, the fiscally conservative Stevenson pressed the federal government to pay claims due Kentucky from Civil War expenses. By the end of his term, the state had collected over $1.5 million in claims. The legislature, however, disregarded his plan for expanding the capitol, instead opting to construct a separate executive office building next to the capitol.|$|E
