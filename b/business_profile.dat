40|$|International audienceEnterprises {{embracing}} Bring-Your-Own-Device encounter {{increased risk}} to data, applications and network resources. The dilemma {{is how to}} address threats with mitigating actions that do not unduly disrupt business, yet protect vulnerable assets. This paper proposes a model that identifies risk context and automatically selects appropriate actions. Risks are detected by conflicting observations, timeline discrepancies and risk-indicating behavior patterns. Detected risks are used to construct risk profiles that capture enterprise's risk mitigation policies via customizable prioritization, and business attributes are used to determine <b>business</b> <b>profiles.</b> It is proposed to utilize a novel multi-dimensional weighting to highlight relationships of risks with assets/actions. Best-fit <b>profiles</b> for both <b>business</b> and risk are selected via ‘if-the-shoe-fits' process. Then, mitigating actions are determined by fusing the risk and <b>business</b> <b>profiles,</b> and precise actions are established via score ‘tolerance bands...|$|R
