Quilombos were mainly located deep in the jungles, far from European influence, and {{after the fall of}} Palmares, all the quilombos either went into hiding or were wiped out by Europeans. Most of the Quilombolas remained hidden so successfully it was assumed they had been destroyed or died out.

However, in the 70s, deforestation reached their lands. Loggers, assuming them to be squatters trying to steal property, forced them off their land at gunpoint and unwittingly stole their land. Nobody believed they were really surviving Quilombolas until the 80s. Enraged ranchers claimed they were squatters pretending to be Quilombolas to get land and make a quick buck. Eventually, they were accepted as Quilombolas, but ranchers still kept stealing their land. The most avid supporter of the Quilombolas was Chico Mendes, who argued for the preservation of the jungle and its native people, including the Quilombolas.|$|E

40|$|Malaysia is the world’s largest {{exporter}} {{and the second}} largest producer of crude palm oil. The government has sought to promote the production of biodiesel derived from palm-oil to capitalise on the growing international demand for biofuels, seen {{as an alternative to}} fossil fuels amidst concerns over rising fuel costs, greenhouse gas emissions and energy security. The Malaysian government launched its National Biofuel Policy in 2006 to promote the commercialisation, use, export and research of biodiesel derived from palm oil. Since then, soaring palm oil prices coupled with a decline in fossil fuel prices have significantly reduced the economic viability of palm oil– based biodiesel production in the country. Consequently, biodiesel production is suppressed to about 10 % or less of the total domestic installed capacity. In February 2010, the government decided to delay implementation of the mandate on the sale of B 5 biodiesel <b>blend</b> <b>until</b> June 2011. The B 5 mandate applies only to the Central Region of Peninsular Malaysia and {{it is unlikely that the}} domestic demand generated will be sufficient to sustain the industry. The current outlook for the Malaysian biodiesel industry looks rather uncertain, as no substantial government subsidies appear to be forthcoming in the near future. Furthermore, the industry is extremely vulnerable to fluctuating palm oil and petroleum prices and the development of restrictive biofuel policies in key consumer markets.

Blanching is a pre-treatment operation whose {{aim is to}} inactivate enzymes, and is usually applied before cutting, peeling, and freezing {{in order to avoid}} browning and changes in texture. Besides inactivating enzymes such as polyphenoloxidase, peroxidase and pectinase, blanching may induce sensory and chemical changes. The purpose of this work was to evaluate changes in antioxidant activity of Capsicum annuum Jalapeño type, when treating with microwaves to inactivate polyphenoloxidase. The whole fresh peppers (85 % moisture) were <b>blended</b> <b>until</b> a paste was obtained. Ten grams portions were placed in a glass container and processed in a microwave oven until the inactivation of polyphenoloxidase was reached. Inactivation of the enzyme was confirmed with a spectrophotometric method using catechol as substrate. The processed peppers samples were mixed with 80 % ethanol to extract phenolic compounds that were determined by the Folin Ciocalteu method. The antioxidant activity was evaluated using the radical ABTS, as described by Charurin et al (2002). Results showed that phenolic compounds were reduced from 9. 6 to 7. 6 mg/ g peppers (dry weight basis) and antioxidant activity was enhanced from 29 to 42 μM de trolox/ g peppers (dry weight basis) with thermal microwave blanching. Changes in the content of phenolic compounds were confirmed using high performance liquid chromatography, and the emergence of other phenol derivatives with enhanced antioxidant activity was detected in blanched samples. It may be concluded that blanching Jalapeño peppers with microwaves may induce the formation of derivatives of phenolics with enhanced antioxidant activity...|$|R

A total of 2400 one-day-old male Ross 308 broiler chicks, with average initial body weight 44. 21 ± 0. 19 g, was distributed according to a completely randomized design in a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement. Six treatments, consisting of diets containing two zinc oxide levels (0 and 0. 01 % of the diet) and three organic acid blend levels (0, 0. 15, and 0. 30 %) were applied, with eight replicates of 50 birds each. The experimental diets were supplied ad libitum for 42 days.

50|$|The Mohawk and Susquehannock {{were the}} most militaristic. Trying to corner trade with the Europeans, they {{targeted}} other tribes. The Mohawk were also known for refusing white settlement on their land and banishing any of their people who converted to Christianity. They posed {{a major threat to}} the Abenaki and Mohicans, while the Susquehannock briefly conquered the Lenape in the 1600s. The most devastating event of the century, however, was the Beaver Wars. From approximately 1640-1680, Iroquoian peoples waged campaigns which extended from modern day Michigan to Virginia against Algonquin and Siouan tribes, as well as each other. The aim was to control more land for animal trapping, a career most natives had turned to in hopes of trading with whites first. Not only did this completely change the ethnography of the region, most large game was hunted out before whites ever fully explored the land. Still, afterward, the Iroquois Confederacy offered shelter to refugees of the Mascouten, Erie, Chonnonton, Tutelo, Saponi and Tuscarora nations. In the 1700s, they would also merge with the Mohawk during the French-Indian War and take in the remaining Susquehannock of Pennsylvania after they were decimated in war.

25|$|Over 30 {{different}} grapes {{varieties are}} {{grown in the}} Friuli-Venezia Giulia including international varieties such as Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot {{as well as local}} varieties like Refosco dal peduncolo rosso, Schioppettino, Friulano, Ribolla gialla and Verduzzo. Of the local varieties, Friulano is the most well known and important variety, producing crisp, floral wines that develop notes of nuts and fennel as it ages. The grape was widely known as Tocai Friulano but in 2006 the European Union banned names that have some similarity or association with the Hungarian wine Tokaji. Now Tocai Friulano is called Friulano. The very acidic Ribolla gialla grape was primarily used as a <b>blending</b> component <b>until</b> winemakers started to apply the techniques used with Chardonnay (such as malolactic fermentation) to produce softer, more buttery wines that still retain the crisp, lemon edge of the grape. Wines made from Verduzzo have peach and nutty flavors in their youth but develop more honeyed flavors as the wine ages. The high acidity of the grape works well in sweet production and in regions like Ramandolo it is often dried to make a passito wine. The Picolit grape also does well in sweet wines where it can produce elegant, floral wines that have a dry finish. In contrast to the thin, sometimes bland Pinot grigio produced {{in other parts of the}} Tre-Venezie, well made examples of Friuli Pinot grigio are known for their fuller body and delicate peach, almond and green apple flavors. Sauvignon blancs are made in a style reminiscent of Sancerre with smoke, herbs and elements of honey and hazelnut. Some of the most expensive Friuli wines are made from the Picolit grape which is prone to grape diseases and mutations which cause the vine to lose its flowers and grape clusters. In most years, less than half of a vineyard Picolit crop will survive and be able to make wine. The light, honeyed dessert wine that it can produce is often in high demand because of restricted supply.|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} {{medical record}} (EMR), a. k. a. health information technology (HIT), is being widely promoted by governments, HMOs, large employers, hospitals, and even organized medicine. Doctors are now being urged to restrict EMR purchases to systems that will ultimately be certified by CCHIT (Certification Commission for Healthcare Information Technology). Why {{is it so important}} to have CCHIT? The key word is interoperability. CCHIT is supposedly a nonprofit entity with a contract with HHS to accelerate the development of interoperable systems. CMS Secretary Michael Leavitt has formed a committee to spur the development of the interoperable EMR: the American Health Information Community (AHIC). Buried deep in these deliberations is the true purpose of interoperability: We want the data. Why do they want the data? Most importantly, it will enable them to implement standards that will easily translate into pay for performance (P 4 P). P 4 P will lead to cost savings to payers who will refuse payment for what is considered poor performance. Could poor performance be the new label for superior or costlier care? Interestingly, one of the arguments served up for enticing physicians to buy into the EMR is that better documentation will translate into higher reimbursements! This actually happened when some Ohio doctors started coding more Level 4 visits when using EMRs. Anthems response, however, was to blend the rates for levels 3 and 4 in order to circumvent the higher payout: Anthem regional executives refuse to discontinue their <b>blended</b> rate policy <b>until</b> the company can devise a solution that allows them to maintain their profit margins. Make no mistake about this: once enough physicians are fully interoperable, P 4 P will become a nightmareall in the name of quality, of course.

The symposium is divided into three main tracks, each one focusing a specific aspect of languages, from natural languages to compilers. * The HHL (Human-Human Languages) track is dedicated to the discussion of research projects and ideas involving natural language processing and their industrial application. * The HCL (Human-Computer Languages) track is where researchers, developers and educators exchange ideas and information on the latest academic or industrial work on language design, processing, assessment and applications. * The CCL (Computer-Computer Languages) track main goal is to provide a broad space for discussion about the XML markup language, examples of usage and associated technologies. SLATE follows the footsteps of two former conferences: CoRTA, the Conference on Compilers, Related Technologies and Applications; and XATA, the conference on XML, Applications and Applied Technologies, both with {{more than a decade of}} history. This volume contains the proceedings of the 2 nd edition of SLATE, held in the Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Sciences, University of Porto, Portugal, during June 20 - 21, 2013. This year, SLATE received a total of 26 paper submissions for the three tracks. Each submission was reviewed by at least three Program Committee members, which included 55 researchers (counting sub-reviewers). At the end, 19 papers were selected for publication and presentation at the symposium, resulting in a 27 % rejection rate. The set of accepted papers present a variety of contributions and were divided into the following five sessions for presentation at the symposium: * Software Development Tools, includes four articles on programming languages compilation and analysis; * XML and Applications, includes four articles on the usage of XML in different areas, ranging from the annotation of documents to its use on the semantic web; * Languages on Learning Environments, includes three articles that focus the automation on exercises generation and evaluation; * Domain Specific Languages, includes four articles on languages for specific languages, from music, robots or graphical user interfaces; * Natural Language Processing, includes four articles related to processing and teaching natural languages. In addition to these sessions, the program also included two keynote presentations, one on the PICAT system, a scalable logic-based language, by Neng-Fa Zhou (Brooklyn College, New York), and another on software languages and their history, by Jean-Marie Favre (University of Grenoble, France). The organizers of SLATE 2013 are in debt to many people without whom this event would never been possible. We wish to thank to our sponsors for making this event possible and to the EasyChair conference management system for simplifying our task. Thanks must go also to the authors of all submitted papers for their contribution and interest in the symposium and to the participants for making the event a meeting point for a fruitful exchange of ideas and feedback on recent developments. Finally, we want to express our gratitude to the Program Committee members and sub-reviewers, as the symposium would not have been possible without their dedicated time and knowledge in evaluating and ranking so many submissions from so many different topics. To all, our deepest thanks...|$|R
