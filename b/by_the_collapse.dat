5|$|Four British athletes {{competed in}} alpine skiing {{events at the}} Games. Andy Noble and David Ryding {{qualified}} for two events each whilst Ed Drake and Chemmy Alcott, taking part in her third Olympics, qualified for all five variants. The preparations of Britain's skiers were disrupted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of Snowsport GB, but all athletes were able to enter the games after {{the intervention of the}} British Olympic Association. Alcott, considered a realistic contender for a medal, achieved the squad's best finish coming eleventh in the women's combined.|$|E

5|$|Incapillo is a Pleistocene caldera, a {{depression}} formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of a volcano, in the La Rioja province of Argentina. Part of the Argentine Andes, {{it is considered}} the southernmost volcanic centre in the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes with Pleistocene activity. Incapillo {{is one of several}} ignimbritic or calderic systems that, along with 44 active stratovolcanoes, are part of the Central Volcanic Zone.|$|E
5|$|St. John's, and the {{province}} as a whole, was gravely affected in the 1990s <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> {{of the northern}} cod fishery, which had been {{the driving force of}} the provincial economy for hundreds of years. After a decade of high unemployment rates and depopulation, the city's proximity to the Hibernia, Terra Nova and White Rose oil fields led to an economic boom that spurred population growth and commercial development. As a result, the St. John's area now accounts for about half of {{the province}}'s economic output.|$|E
5|$|The main {{criticism}} levelled at the EIHL is {{that the}} league is too expensive, an accusation given credence <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the London Racers mid season in 2005, and the continued financial problems experienced {{by a number of}} other member clubs (most notably Basingstoke Bison and Manchester Phoenix in 2008–09). Both the Edinburgh Capitals and Newcastle Vipers made public statements about their potentially perilous financial situations, casting further doubt over both their own, and the league's sustained viability.|$|E

5|$|As part of post-Cold War restructuring, NATO's {{military}} {{structure was}} cut back and reorganized, with new forces {{such as the}} Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps established. The changes brought about <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Soviet Union on the military balance in Europe were recognized in the Adapted Conventional Armed Forces in Europe Treaty, which was signed in 1999. The policies of French President Nicolas Sarkozy resulted in a major reform of France's military position, culminating with the return to full membership on 4April 2009, which also included France rejoining the NATO Military Command Structure, while maintaining an independent nuclear deterrent.|$|E
5|$|The Hoxne Hoard {{was buried}} {{during a period}} of great {{upheaval}} in Britain, marked <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of Roman authority in the province, the departure {{of the majority of the}} Roman army, and the first of a wave of attacks by the Anglo-Saxons. Attacks on Italy by the Visigoths around the turn of the fifth century caused the general Stilicho to recall Roman army units from Rhaetia, Gaul, and Britannia. While Stilicho held off the Visigoth attack, the Western provinces were left defenceless against Suebi, Alans, and Vandals who crossed the frozen Rhine in 406 and overran Gaul. The remaining Roman troops in Britain, fearing that the invaders would cross the Channel, elected a series of emperors of their own to lead the defence.|$|E
5|$|The Knox and Kane Railroad {{was forced}} to suspend {{operations}} in October 2004 after a 75percent {{decline in the number}} of passengers, possibly brought about <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of the Kinzua Bridge. The Kovalchick Corporation bought the Knox and Kane's tracks and all other property owned by the railroad, including the locomotives and rolling stock. The Kovalchick Corporation also owns the East Broad Top Railroad and was the company that owned the Kinzua Bridge before selling it to the state in 1963. The company disclosed plans in 2008 to remove the tracks and sell them for scrap. The right-of-way would then be used to establish a rail trail.|$|E

5|$|These {{events are}} {{at the tail end}} of the long GRB {{duration}} distribution, lasting more than 10,000 seconds. They have been proposed to form a separate class, caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of a blue supergiant star, a tidal disruption event or a new-born magnetar. Only a small number have been identified to date, their primary characteristic being their gamma ray emission duration. The most studied ultra-long events include GRB 101225A and GRB 111209A. The low detection rate may be a result of low sensitivity of current detectors to long-duration events, rather than a reflection of their true frequency. A 2013 study, on the other hand, shows that the existing evidence for a separate ultra-long GRB population with a new type of progenitor is inconclusive, and further multi-wavelength observations are needed to draw a firmer conclusion.|$|E
5|$|In December 2007, the United States {{entered the}} longest post–World War II recession, which {{included}} a housing market correction, a subprime mortgage crisis, soaring oil prices, and a declining dollar value. In February, 63,000 jobs were lost, a five-year record. To aid with the situation, Bush signed a $170billion economic stimulus package which was intended to improve the economic situation by sending tax rebate checks to many Americans and providing tax breaks for struggling businesses. The Bush administration pushed for significantly increased regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2003, and after two years, the regulations passed the House but died in the Senate. Many Republican senators, as well as influential members of the Bush Administration, feared that the agency created by these regulations would merely be mimicking the private sector's risky practices. In September 2008, the crisis became much more serious beginning with the government takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac followed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of Lehman Brothers and a federal bailout of American International Group for $85billion.|$|E
5|$|Over 225,000residents lost {{electricity}} and 12,000 lost telephone service. Some vandalism and looting was reported during {{the loss of}} power, and the police made several arrests during the night. For over 24hours roads were closed on the islands of El Hierro, Tenerife and La Palma: the first two due to landslides and the third <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of an old house and a massive tree. One {{of the most famous}} geological features of the island of Gran Canaria, El Dedo de Dios (or God's finger), which had been pointing towards the sky for over a millennium, was destroyed by Delta's wind and wave action along Gran Canaria's shore. Upon hearing of the destruction of the natural monument one man, later found to be clinically insane, unsuccessfully tried to kill himself and then stabbed three members of his own family.|$|E
25|$|The {{commission}} classified {{the accident}} as survivable because the impact forces varied along the fuselage. The tail-first impact was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> first officer's last-second attempt at raising the aircraft. Most of the fatalities resulted from people having been {{trapped in the}} sinking sections, which was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> of <b>the</b> structure after impact. <b>The</b> <b>collapse</b> was caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> compromise of the tubular integrity, which was dependent on the keel beam that had been torn off on impact.|$|R
50|$|Thermotropism or thermotropic {{movement}} is {{the movement of}} a plant or part of a plant {{in response to a}} change in temperature. A common example is the curling of Rhododendron leaves in response to cold temperatures. Mimosa pudica also show thermotropism <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> of leaf petioles leading to the folding of leaflets, when temperature drops.|$|R

5|$|Rima Hadley, a sinuous rille located {{west of the}} Apollo 15 landing site, {{begins in}} an area of low domes at an {{elongated}} crater, Běla, and runs on to the North along the Apennine Mountain Range. Some research has suggested that both the rille and Běla are volcanic vents, and lava flows created the features. Another hypothesis suggests that the rille was originally an underground lava tube, the roof of which collapsed, creating the current appearance of the rille. Several large boulders, some of which are as large as houses, are strewn about the feature's floor. The elongated crater Běla, which forms the beginning of Rima Hadley, could have been formed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of a shallow magma chamber. Visual observation suggests that the same is the case with other lunar rilles with similar features at their beginnings.|$|E
5|$|Several {{communities}} in Baker County were devastated, leaving seven people dead, {{as many as}} 100 injured, and hundreds destitute. The county sheriff estimated that merely a dozen houses out of a thousand survived the storm, that thousands of cows were killed, and that {{hundreds of thousands of}} trees were toppled. Not one church or school was left standing in the county, and damage there was estimated at $250,000. Eight people were killed in Suwannee County, including two children crushed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse</b> of their home near Wellborn. In Columbia County, dozens of buildings suffered near or total destruction, while nine people were killed. One woman lost her life in Grady, a small settlement in Lafayette County. Additionally, there were five fatalities in Bradford County, including one man reportedly struck by flying bricks that were lofted nearly a half mile downwind. Strong winds and heavy rainfall affected areas as far southeast as St. Augustine. In Fernandina Beach, the hurricane toppled oak trees and destroyed buildings. Although wind gusts in Jacksonville reached , the effects were generally insignificant.|$|E
5|$|The {{windward}} {{side of the}} Kohala mountains is dissected by multiple, deeply eroded stream valleys in a southwest-northeast alignment, cutting into the flanks of the volcano. North of Kohala's summit the volcano's northwest-southeast trending rift zone separates rainfall into two streams, going southeast, into Waipio Valley, or northwest, into Honokane Nui Valley. When the volcano was still active, vertical sheets of magma, arranged in {{what is known as}} dikes, forced {{their way out of the}} magma reservoir and intruded into the rift zone, which was weakened <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapse.</b> As the dikes forced their way up, they formed fractures and faults parallel to the rift zone. The exertion caused by the dikes produced a series of faults along its length, forming horsts and grabens (fault blocks). Northeast of the Kohala summit, where the most rainfall occurs, the faulted structure prevents summit rainwater from naturally flowing northeast down the mountain slope. Instead, the rainwater flows down laterally and empties into the back of what have thus become the largest valleys (Waipio and Honokane Nui).|$|E

50|$|The {{stepwise}} loss of Western Roman Empire dominance, {{replaced with}} foederati and Germanic kingdoms, coincided with early missionary efforts into areas not controlled <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>collapsing</b> empire.
