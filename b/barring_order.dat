40|$|The {{call for}} {{preventive}} interventions to curb domestic violence is becoming stronger. The <b>barring</b> <b>order</b> has been launched as an innovative approach to preventing domestic violence. It allows {{the police to}} temporarily bar the perpetrator of domestic violence from entering his or her home, {{as a way to}} create safety for the victim and children and to start support programmes for victim and perpetrator. This article provides a brief review of experiences with the <b>barring</b> <b>order</b> in Austria, Germany, and the Netherlands. The results of the evaluation of the recently proposed Dutch <b>barring</b> <b>order</b> will be discussed, as well as their theoretical implications. The results indicate that the implementation of the new measure is facing reluctance among the police. It is argued that this points to more than empirical start-up problems, but reflects the dominant impact of law. Because the implementation of the <b>barring</b> <b>order</b> {{is in the hands of}} the police, a dynamic is created that is often at odds with the preventive nature of the measure, which requires taking a less legalistic and more process-oriented approach to domestic violence. It begs the fundamental question of whether and how prevention of domestic violence can be realized when assigning the gate-keeping task to the police. Related to this is a broader question: how can perpetrators’ and victims’ interests, and victims’ agency, be safeguarded when the state takes control...|$|E

40|$|Many {{commentators}} {{have questioned the}} efficacy of the SEC’s enforcement program {{in the aftermath of the}} 2008 financial crisis. Some criticize the agency for allowing corporate defendants to settle charges without admitting or denying liability. Others dispute the impact of astronomical fines levied against too-big-to-fail financial institutions. Still others urge prosecutors to bring criminal charges against those who led the failed financial firms to ruin. This Article, written for a symposium on SEC enforcement, focuses attention on an underutilized weapon in the SEC’s arsenal: the power to bar officers and directors of public companies from future service in such roles. Despite longstanding power to seek and impose bars, the SEC seldom pursues the remedy against senior executives or directors of large firms. The bar has the potential to act as a corrective and deterrent device. If sought more widely, the bar could operate both to prevent future misconduct and to express societal assessments of individual responsibility for massive corporate failures. For these reasons, the SEC should look to the bar more frequently as a remedy for fraud. After laying out the case for the increased use of <b>bar</b> <b>orders,</b> the Article recommends changes to SEC enforcement strategies that could help improve the agency’s success rate when seeking <b>bar</b> <b>orders</b> in court...|$|R
