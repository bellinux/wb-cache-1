5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Entoloma murrayi derives nutrients <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> down organic matter. Fruit {{bodies are}} found in wet coniferous and deciduous forests, where they grow singly or in small groups {{on the ground in}} litterfall or humus, or in moss. Fruiting occurs in the summer and autumn.|$|E
5|$|Disruptive {{coloration}} (also {{known as}} disruptive camouflage or disruptive patterning) {{is a form}} of camouflage that works <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> up the outlines of an animal, soldier or military vehicle with a strongly contrasting pattern. It is often combined with other methods of crypsis including background colour matching and countershading. It appears paradoxical as a way of not being seen, since disruption of outlines depends on high contrast, so the patches of colour are themselves conspicuous.|$|E
5|$|P. semilanceata, {{like all}} others {{species of the}} genus Psilocybe, is a {{saprobic}} fungus, meaning it obtains nutrients <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> down organic matter. The mushroom is also associated with sedges in moist areas of fields, and it is thought {{to live on the}} decaying root remains.|$|E

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Podoserpula pusio grow on the ground, on well-rotted stumps, or among {{decaying}} tussock grass. They are {{presumed to be}} saprobic, and obtain nutrients <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> down larger organic molecules found in the soil or in decaying wood. P.miranda in contrast, {{is thought to be}} ectomycorrhizal, as it appears to associate with Arillastrum gummiferum, the predominant canopy tree in the forests where it is found.|$|E

5|$|Unlike {{other members}} of this phylum, {{anthozoans}} {{do not have a}} medusa stage in their development. Instead, they release sperm and eggs into the water. After fertilisation, the planula larvae form part of the plankton. When fully developed, the larvae settle on the seabed and attach to the substrate, undergoing metamorphosis into polyps. Some anthozoans can also reproduce asexually through budding or <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> in pieces. More than 6,100 species have been described.|$|E
5|$|Bisporella citrina is saprobic, and so obtains {{nutrients}} <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> down complex {{organic molecules}} into simpler ones. Fruit bodies are typically encountered growing in dense clusters {{on the surface}} of rotten wood (especially deciduous trees), particularly beech. They have also been found growing on the fruit bodies of the polypore fungus Daedaleopsis confragosa. In a study of the succession of fungi associated with the decay of a 120-year-old healthy beech tree uprooted by strong winds, B.citrina was found on the wood about three years after the fall. It appeared after early colonizers such as Quaternaria quaternata, Tubercularia vulgaris (the anamorph form of Nectria cinnabarina), and Bulgaria inquinans, and was followed by Stereum hirsutum and Nectria cinnabarina.|$|E

He also {{competed in the}} 4×200-metre freestyle, where he broke the South American record {{with a time of}} 7:06:09, along with Rodrigo Castro, Thiago Pereira and Lucas Salatta. In December, he began to stand out on the national scene, <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> the South American record of Fernando Scherer in the 100-metre freestyle (48.69 seconds) which had stood since 1998. Cielo's time was 48.61 seconds, beating the record by 0.08 seconds. At that moment, Cielo's was the fourth fastest time in the 2006 world ranking.|$|E

He decided to invade and occupy Midway Atoll, which he was sure would draw out the American carriers to defend it. The Japanese codenamed the Midway invasion Operation MI. Unknown to the Japanese, the US Navy had divined the Japanese plan <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> its JN-25 code and had prepared an ambush using its three available carriers, positioned northeast of Midway.|$|E
5|$|Connecticut fumbled {{the ball}} for the sixth time on the next possession; this time Donald Brown was {{responsible}} for dropping the ball. Buffalo recovered for the fifth time, {{but was unable to}} score, punting to ball back to UConn with 4:37 left in the half. Brown made up for his earlier mistake <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> off a 75-yard run before being caught from behind. On the next play Tyler Lorenzen ran the ball into the end zone from 13yards out. Neither team scored {{for the remainder of the}} first half, making the score 20–17 Buffalo going into halftime.|$|E
5|$|Dichlorine heptoxide (Cl2O7) is the {{anhydride}} of {{perchloric acid}} (HClO4) and can readily {{be obtained from}} it by dehydrating it with phosphoric acid at −10°C and then distilling the product at −35°C and 1mmHg. It is a shock-sensitive, colourless oily liquid. It is the least reactive of the chlorine oxides, being {{the only one to}} not set organic materials on fire at room temperature. It may be dissolved in water to regenerate perchloric acid or in aqueous alkalis to regenerate perchlorates. However, it thermally decomposes explosively <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> one of the central Cl–O bonds, producing the radicals ClO3 and ClO4 which immediately decompose to the elements through intermediate oxides.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Hygrocybe appalachianensis grow singly, in groups, or {{clusters}} on the ground. Like all Hygrocybe species, the fungus {{is believed to}} be saprophytic, meaning it obtains nutrients <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> down organic matter. It fruits in deciduous or mixed forest, typically appearing between the months of July and December. Its range covers a region extending from the states Ohio and West Virginia south to South Carolina and Tennessee. Its occurrence is occasional to locally common.|$|E
5|$|In early July 1941, Rejewski and Zygalski {{were asked}} to try solving {{messages}} enciphered on the secret Polish Lacida cipher machine, which was used for secure communications between Cadix and the Polish General Staff in London. Lacida was a rotor machine {{based on the same}} cryptographic principle as Enigma, yet had never been subjected to rigorous security analysis. The two cryptologists created consternation <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> the first message within a couple of hours; further messages were solved in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} produce a Horn instance, no two {{variables}} that appear in the same clause of the renamable Horn instance should appear positively in that clause; this constraint {{on a pair of}} variables is a 2-satisfiability constraint. By finding a satisfying assignment to the resulting 2-satisfiability instance, Lewis shows how to turn any renamable Horn instance into a Horn instance in polynomial time. <b>By</b> <b>breaking</b> up long clauses into multiple smaller clauses, and applying a linear-time 2-satisfiability algorithm, it is possible to reduce this to linear time.|$|E

5|$|Most of the {{structures}} that make up animals, plants and microbes are made from three basic classes of molecule: amino acids, carbohydrates and lipids (often called fats). As these molecules are vital for life, metabolic reactions either focus on making these molecules during the construction of cells and tissues, or <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> them down and using them {{as a source of}} energy, by their digestion. These biochemicals can be joined together to make polymers such as DNA and proteins, essential macromolecules of life.|$|E
5|$|Mutinus elegans is saprobic—deriving {{nutrients}} <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> down dead {{or dying}} organic matter. It is {{commonly found in}} gardens and farm areas enriched with manure, near well-decayed stumps and logs, and in wood chips. A Japanese publication mentioned its occurrence in Takatsuki and Osaka-fu, where it fruited in November and December on the ground along paths or in open spaces, under or near bamboo (Phyllostachys bambusoides) and hardwoods such as the Sawtooth Oak, the Japanese Zelkova, and the Camphor tree.|$|E
5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of hyponitrous acid (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates <b>by</b> <b>breaking</b> the weaker N–O bond.|$|E
