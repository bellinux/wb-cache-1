50|$|Until 1916, the <b>Balls</b> <b>Head</b> {{area was}} frequented {{by the local}} Aboriginal {{community}} and sites including middens, art sites and rock engravings remain today. The Aboriginal name for <b>Balls</b> <b>Head</b> is Yerroulbine.The reserve is named after Lieutenant Henry Lidgbird Ball, Commander of the ship Supply in the First Fleet of 1788. <b>Balls</b> <b>Head</b> was the original foreshore land included in the large Wollstonecraft Estate. In 1912 the Australian Army claimed the land and a Quarantine Depot was established in Berrys Bay to service the boats operating {{to and from the}} Quarantine station at North Head.Strong public protests {{in the early part of}} the 20th century resulted in <b>Balls</b> <b>Head</b> becoming public parkland (rather than being used for commercial or residential purposes as was mooted) in 1926.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> {{utilizes}} a <b>ball</b> joint {{to allow}} movement of all axes of rotation {{from a single}} point. Some <b>ball</b> <b>heads</b> also have a separate panoramic rotation axis {{on the base of}} the head. The head has two main parts, the ball, which attaches to the camera and the socket, which attaches to the tripod. The camera is attached to the ball via quick release plate, or a simple UNC 1/4"-20 [...] screw. The socket is where the ball rotates in, and also contains the controls for locking the ball. The socket has a slot on the side, to allow the camera to be rotated to the portrait orientation. <b>Ball</b> <b>heads</b> come in varying styles of complexity. Some have only one control for both ball and pan lock. While others have individual controls for the ball, pan, and also <b>ball</b> friction. <b>Ball</b> <b>heads</b> are used when a free-flow movement of the camera is needed. They are also more stable and can hold heavier loads, than pan-tilt <b>heads.</b> However, <b>ball</b> <b>heads</b> have the disadvantage that only one control is available to allow or prevent movement of all axes of rotation, so if the camera is tilted on one axis, there may be a risk of tilting on the other axes as well. When a movement of one, or two axes or rotation is needed, a pan-tilt head is used.|$|R

50|$|A <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> is a {{metal or}} plastic {{apparatus}} placed {{on top of}} a tripod that increases stability and provides faster, more accurate rotation for the photographer.

However, they are usually quite expensive due to the precision-made pieces inside and the detailed finish outside -- most professional-quality heads are more than $200 USD, although some heads are available for less than $100.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{brittleness}} {{of ceramics}} has been their weak spot when considering them for total hip replacements. There are several situations from which concentrated stresses can develop and induce {{failure of the}} components. It {{is not a problem}} of the material’s properties in particular but also its design. This means that even proof tested-third generation-ISO obeying ceramics may fail if the incidence of the design parameters on them is not carefully evaluated. In this paper, the finite element analysis technique is used to show how the change of ball diameter can affect the Vonmises stress on the <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> component when it is subjected to a high (trauma-like) load. The analysis is nonlinear and was carefully tested for convergence. 3 D models of four different <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> diameters where constructed, two designs of the bore/cone interface with two sets of material properties (Alumina and Zirconia) were considered. The results from these analyses are given in the form of stress maps on the ball heads; such data may be useful for surgeons, patients, and designers because it shows a direct relationship between two important parameters on <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> design (diameter and bore) and material properties, on the stresses that can cause failure of the component when they are concentrated in small elements of volume...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: of {{this paper}} was follow up of {{compatibility}} of femoral component taper from TiAl 6 V 4 ELI acc. ISO 5832 - 3 and ceramic head of the new type of total hip join replacement THR - ZRM® in vitro. Design/methodology/approach: from december 2006 to august 2007 we have tested THR taper component and <b>ball</b> ceramic <b>head.</b> On the base of our patents (SK, CZ, EU, USA) from 1999 to 2006 we have designed and developed the new type of cementlesss THR - ZRM®. These total hip replacements were tested in our prospective study. We have evaluated compatibility and loading resistance of taper of THR ZRM® made from TiAl 6 V 4 alloy ELI and ceramic <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> Biolox® forte (28 - 12 / 14 L) by tests of burst strength, pull out, rotational stability, fatigue and post-fatigue. Tests were monitored independent observer. Findings: in the burst test were tested 7 parts and average loading was 54 kN. The reached values comply with the requirements according to CeramTec procedure VA 02 04 4129 and the FDA Guidance document for the preparation of premarket notifications for ceramic ball hip systems. In the fatigue test all specimens test at a maximum load of 14 kN reached 10 million cycles without mechanical failure. The post fatigue test was performed with load of 46 kN and no failure of head and taper system was observed. The pull-off tests were made with pull out strength of 1439 N has been used on 5 parts and no pullout of ceramic <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> of taper femoral component was observed. Last was the test of rotational stability, where <b>ball</b> <b>head</b> was rotational stable under strength of 1254 Ncm. Research limitations/implications: this study was performed on the small group of spices but enough relevant according FDA and international ISO prescriptions. Originality/value: this study is original by publishing first results of the new cementless THR- ZRM® tests of compatibility and fatigue of metal taper and ceramic <b>ball</b> <b>head.</b> Value {{of this paper}} is in vitro testing and prepares ZRM® cementless THR for clinical use in human...|$|R

40|$|P. McLeod, N. Reed, and Z. Dienes (2002) {{argued that}} the linear optical {{trajectory}} (LOT) strategy incorrectly cues fielders to run forward for <b>balls</b> <b>headed</b> beyond them. The authors of this article explain that the downward optical curvature found for balls landing beyond the fielder’s initial position occurs because the balls reorient the direction the fielder is facing during pursuit. Thus, when downward optical curvature begins, the <b>ball</b> is <b>headed</b> to land in front of where the fielder is facing and running. This investigation of open-loop failure conditions has led to new insights such as the reorientation of the fielder, and it supports the use of maintaining matching rates of vertical and lateral optical ball movement consistent with primacy of the LOT control mechanism even when interception is unachievable. In a recent article, McLeod, Reed, and Dienes (2002) high-lighted an interesting feature of the optical trajectories of balls being pursued by fielders, as presented by Shaffer and McBeath (2002). They noted that there is downward optical curvature of the trajectories for <b>balls</b> <b>headed</b> beyond fielders. They sug-gested that this conflicts with the maintenance of linearit...|$|R
