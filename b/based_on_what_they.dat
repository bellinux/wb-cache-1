25|$|Over {{the next}} twenty years, {{patterns}} of immigration continued to change. The government encouraged more {{people to come to}} Australia and many more assisted agreements were made with countries. In the late 1950s, more immigrants began to be accepted from the Middle East. In 1958, under the Migration Act 1958, the dictation test was removed and a new universal visa scheme or entry permits introduced. This allowed non-Europeans to immigrate. Their entry was now <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could contribute to Australia and if it could be shown that they could integrate into Australian society. This attracted many professionals and highly qualified people who added to Australia's relatively small tertiary industry.|$|E
25|$|The game {{is usually}} self-refereed, {{relying on the}} players to call their own infractions {{and to try to}} play within the rules of the game. It is assumed that players will not {{intentionally}} violate the rules and will be honest when discussing foul calls with opponents. This is called Spirit of the Game. After a call is made, the players should decide on an outcome, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> think happened and how the rules apply to that situation. If a player has been fouled on a catch, they will often gain possession of the disc. If the players cannot agree on a catching foul, the disc can be given back to the thrower, with play restarting as if before the disputed throw.|$|E

25|$|Mexican {{handcrafted}} {{toys are}} mostly miniature representations {{of things in}} life, such as birds, furniture, mermaids, bullfighting scenes, carts and much more, made with materials on hand such as bulrush, wood, cloth, clay and lead. They were mostly made for children of the Mexican underclasses. They are considered artistic not because of originality but rather the ingenuity of creating something special from practically nothing. These toys, most of which that survive are from the 19th and early 20th century are increasingly valued by collectors but are in disdain among the general Mexican populace. Since the 1950s, with the influence of movies and television, most children stopped wanting these types of toys for mass products produced abroad and <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see in media. Most toys sold to tourists now are cheaply made imitations {{of what used to}} be common.|$|E

25|$|The Egyptians {{were one}} of the first major civilizations to codify design {{elements}} in art. The wall painting done {{in the service of the}} Pharaohs followed a rigid code of visual rules and meanings. Early Egyptian art is characterized by the absence of linear perspective, which results in a seemingly flat space. These artists tended to create images <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> knew, and not as much on what they saw. Objects in these artworks generally do not decrease in size as they increase in distance and there is little shading to indicate depth. Sometimes, distance is indicated through the use of tiered space, where more distant objects are drawn higher above the nearby objects, but in the same scale and with no overlapping of forms. People and objects are almost always drawn in profile. Also, you may notice the people in Egyptian art are never facing forward. Archaeologists are not yet sure of why, but they are leaning towards the fact that artists status was low in the hierarchy so they could never be in front of a higher authority figure, and never be faced towards them.|$|E

25|$|The {{main point}} of {{contention}} in the umpiring of the 1974–75 Ashes series was the intimidatory bowling of the Australian fast bowlers Dennis Lillee and Jeff Thomson. There were a few other issues, though there were the usual cases of batsmen being given out or not out despite the differing opinions of the players and umpire. At the time, umpires had no recourse to slow motion replays and had to make decisions <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> saw in a split second, {{with the benefit of}} the doubt always going to the batsman. As a result it was not uncommon for umpires to make mistakes, which over the course of a long series tended to cancel each other out. The best an umpire could do was to make an honest judgement based on what he saw. Tom Brooks and Robin Bailhache were the umpires in all six Tests, but were junior for so important a series. Brooks having made his debut in the 1970–71 Ashes series and Bailhache in the First Test at Brisbane. Unusually for Australian umpires of the time Brooks had played First Class Cricket – he had been a lively fast-medium bowler – and as a result was more able to connect with the Test players, and was more forgiving of short-pitched deliveries which he saw as a natural part of the game. This helped England in 1970–71 when they had the fast bowlers John Snow and Bob Willis, but proved fatal for their batsmen in 1974–75.|$|E

Phone-a-Friend was removed on the episode aired January 11, 2010, after it was determined that there was an increasing trend of contestants' friends using search engines and other Internet resources, unfairly privileging individuals who had computer access over those who did not, and that it was contrary to the original intent of the lifeline where friends were supposed to provide assistance <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> already knew.
