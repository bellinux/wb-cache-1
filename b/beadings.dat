This study responds {{to a series}} of design related questions raised in the author's mind upon visiting the Kimbell museum on June 22, 2000. The work will evaluate the buildings' major design elements, beginning with the overall site and building organization, and end with the relationship between structure, space and natural light. The building is documented with numerous photographs taken during my visit to illustrate its experiential aspects. This study examines how the Kimbell Art Museum prompts <b>'readings</b> and re-readings,' associations, symbolisms, and meanings that may initially appear elusive, contradictory or even obscure. My analysis suggests that Louis Kahn designed the Kimbell to generate obscure readings, or to be more precise, he utilized ambiguous design features capable of being understood in two or more possible senses. My analysis also raises questions such as, 'What types of ambiguity are employed in this museum, and why?', and 'How does the Kimbell Art Museum as both building and experience compare to Kahn's stated design goals?' The lens through which this examination takes place is my own experience of the building, tempered by an examination of the building's documentation compared to what Kahn wrote, sketched and built. This project aims to offer plausible insights into the building'S numerous, seemingly ambiguous design features. The process of reading and re-reading the Kimbell reveals elusive aspects of the building that to date, have not been adequately considered and articulated.

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} corneal confocal microscopy in the diagnosis of morphologic damage of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus in diabetic patients and to correlate corneal confocal microscopy findings with peripheral diabetic neuropathy. METHODS: Corneal sub-basal nerve plexus parameters were quantified by corneal confocal microscopy in 42 diabetic patients and 27 age-matched controls. The parameters quantified were the number of fibers, the tortuosity of fibers, the number of <b>beadings,</b> and the branching pattern of the fibers. Peripheral neuropathy was also quantified using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. RESULTS: The number of fibers, number of <b>beadings,</b> and branching pattern of fibers significantly decreases in diabetic patients versus control subjects (P<. 0001; P<. 0001; P=. 0006, respectively), whereas nerve tortuosity significantly increases (P<. 0001). The same corneal sub-basal nerve plexus parameters show a statistical trend, suggesting progression of corneal neuropathy with peripheral diabetic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal confocal microscopy represents a new tool in the diagnosis, clinical evaluation, and follow-up of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. This study found that diabetes damages corneal nerves, particularly the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus. This damage may be easily and accurately documented using corneal confocal microscopy.

40|$|Lipid bilayer {{membranes}} are {{models for}} cell membranes [...] the structure that helps regulate cell function. Cell membranes are heterogeneous, and the coupling between composition and shape {{gives rise to}} complex behaviors {{that are important to}} regulation. This thesis seeks to systematically build and analyze complete models to understand the behavior of multi-component membranes. We propose a model and use it to derive the equilibrium and stability conditions for a general class of closed multi-component biological membranes. Our analysis shows that the critical modes of these membranes have high frequencies, unlike single-component vesicles, and their stability depends on system size, unlike in systems undergoing spinodal decomposition in flat space. An important implication is that small perturbations may nucleate localized but very large deformations. We compare these results with experimental observations. We also study open membranes to gain insight into long tubular membranes that arise for example in nerve cells. We derive a complete system of equations for open membranes by using the principle of virtual work. Our linear stability analysis predicts that the tubular membranes tend to have coiling shapes if the tension is small, cylindrical shapes if the tension is moderate, and beading shapes if the tension is large. This is consistent with experimental observations reported in the literature in nerve fibers. Further, we provide numerical solutions to the fully nonlinear equilibrium equations in some problems, and show that the observed mode shapes are consistent with those suggested by linear stability.

Design: Prospective, comparative study. Participants: Thirty-two VKC patients (26 males, 6 females; mean age, 17. 1 years) and 40 normal subjects (20 males, 20 females; mean age, 19. 3 years) were included. Methods: All subjects underwent a full ophthalmologic examination. Confoscan CS 4 (Nidek, Gamagori, Japan) {{images of the}} central cornea were obtained with a X 40 noncontact lens and Z-ring device. Main Outcome Measures: The superficial and basal epithelium, subbasal nerve plexus, anterior stroma, stromal nerves, and endothelium of the central cornea were studied. Results: The VKC patients had increased diameter, reflectivity, and presence of nuclear activation of superficial epithelial cells; reduced density of the basal membrane; lower density of keratocytes, increased presence of activated keratocytes, and inflammatory cells in the anterior stroma; and lower density and number of fibers, lower number of <b>beadings,</b> and higher grade of tortuosity of fibers in the subbasal nerve plexus. Increased alterations in thickness, deflections, and tortuosity were observed in stromal corneal nerves. An increased number of inflammatory cells {{in close proximity to}} the subbasal and stromal nerve fibers also was observed in VKC subjects. Conclusions: Corneal involvement in VKC is associated with alterations of the epithelium and subbasal and stromal corneal nerves.

40|$|Monitoring of {{structural}} integrity {{is critical in}} many fields today, and particularly so in the civil, mechanical and aerospace engineering industries. In the aerospace industry, appreciably sized and almost exclusively composite UAVs share the airspace with other aircraft. Such composite structures also pose numerous uncertainties to structural health monitoring and analysis techniques. This necessitates research into a methodology for practical and effective structural health monitoring techniques. This work presents a methodology for structural health monitoring and particularly delamination detection in composite wing structures. The approach uses experimental modal analysis with due consideration for the probabilistic effects of random variations in material and geometrical properties, {{for the purpose of}} a general and non wing-specific damage detection technique. A large number of composite material coupons were tested to determine statistical distributions of 2 D orthotropic material properties, using an optical image correlation system to reduce the expense of testing. Uncertainties in the wing geometry arising from manufacturing variances were taken into consideration. The material properties of the foam spar and resin <b>beadings</b> were considered isotropic and deterministic. A finite element model of the wing was subsequently improved using a scanning laser vibrometer to conduct detailed experimental modal analyses of five wings, and a multi-model updating approach based on frequency and mode shape information was used to update selected sensitive material properties. Significant improvement was accomplished. Using the probabilistic material property database, a confidence region was established for wing mode shapes through a Monte Carlo procedure. It was shown that delamination effects are capable of perturbing the dynamic mode shapes beyond the confidence regions implied by the material uncertainties. This provides a basis for further development of a structural health monitoring methodology for composite structures, taking due account of the many uncertainties in the structure.

40|$|Spinal {{muscular atrophy}} (SMA) is a genetic {{disorder}} characterized by degeneration of spinal cord motoneurons (MNs), resulting in muscular atrophy and weakness. SMA {{is caused by}} mutations in the Survival Motor Neuron 1 (SMN 1) gene and decreased SMN protein. SMN is ubiquitously expressed and has a general role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins and pre-mRNA splicing requirements. SMN reduction causes neurite degeneration and cell death without classical apoptotic features, but the direct events leading to SMN degeneration in SMA are still unknown. Autophagy is a conserved lysosomal protein degradation pathway whose precise roles in neurodegenerative diseases remain largely unknown. In particular, {{it is unclear whether}} autophagosome accumulation is protective or destructive, but the accumulation of autophagosomes in the neuritic <b>beadings</b> observed in several neurite degeneration models suggests a close relationship between the autophagic process and neurite collapse. In the present work, we describe an increase in the levels of the autophagy markers including autophagosomes, Beclin 1 and light chain (LC) 3 -II proteins in cultured mouse spinal cord MNs from two SMA cellular models, suggesting an upregulation of the autophagy process in Smn (murine survival motor neuron protein) -reduced MNs. Overexpression of Bcl-xL counteracts LC 3 -II increase, contributing to the hypothesis that the protective role of Bcl-xL observed in some SMA models may be mediated by its role in autophagy inhibition. Our in vitro experimental data indicate an upregulation in the autophagy process and autophagosome accumulation in the pathogenesis of SMA, thus providing a valuable clue in understanding the mechanisms of axonal degeneration and a possible therapeutic target in the treatment of SMA.

40|$|Brain {{ischemia}} {{is one of}} {{the leading}} causes of death and disability in the world with enormous socioeconomic consequences annually, however to date, despite multiple studies, the only clinically available remedy is the thrombolytic tissue plasminogen activator (tPa). The development of new therapeutic interventions/strategies requires a deeper insight into the pathology, which can only come from better characterization of ischemic models and usage of appropriate parameters to evaluate neuronal damage. The usage of a right model and cell death assay is essential for an effective translation to in vivo and clinical studies. Organotypical hippocampal slice cultures offer an in vitro model to study brain ischemia by induction of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD). In organotypic hippocampal slice cultures the interaction between neuronal and non-neuronal cells are well preserved and intrinsic connections of the hippocampal structure are largely maintained. However, there is scant data regarding the expression and functionality of N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in such slice cultures. NMDARs, which are essential mediators of synaptic plasticity under normal physiological conditions, are during brain ischemia excessively activated due to glutamate overflow and mediate excitotoxic cell death. The aim of the first part of my thesis was thus to evaluate the expression of NR 1, NR 2 A and NR 2 B and their contribution to excitotoxic cell death after exposure to NMDA or OGD in organotypical hippocampal slices cultures after 14 days in vitro (DIV 14). OGD induced the typical ischemic injury damage as it is delayed and most pronounced in the hippocampus cornu ammonis (CA) 1 pyramidal neurons. This study revealed that NR 1, NR 2 A and NR 2 B subunits were expressed at DIV 14 and contributed to cell death, as shown by use of the NMDAR antagonist MK- 801 (dizocilpine). Excitotoxic cell death induced by NMDA was antagonized by 10 μM MK- 801, a dose that offered only partial protection against OGD-induced cell death. High concentrations of MK- 801 (50 – 100 μM) were required to counteract delayed cell death (48 – 72 h) after OGD. The higher dose of MK- 801 needed for protection against this delayed phase of OGD-induced death could not be attributed to down-regulation of NMDARs at the gene expression level. Additionally, I found that NR 2 B-subunits did not contribute to NMDA-or OGD-induced cell death at DIV 14 and that NR 2 B possibly is post-translationally modified under normal physiological conditions. My data indicate that NMDAR signaling is just one of several mechanisms underlying ischemic cell death and that prospective cytoprotective therapies must be directed to multiple targets. Another important aspect to be taken in consideration in studies aimed to discover cytoprotective agents are the parameters used for evaluation. Most studies evaluate neuronal survival from nuclear damage, which reflects the final stage of cell death and lacks information about neuronal function. The aim of the second part of my thesis was to investigate more subtle changes in neurons prior to cell death by assessing dendritic damage and furthermore to characterize the functionality of these neurons using electrophysiological recordings. Dendritic damage, manifesting as focal swellings of dendrites (<b>beadings),</b> is an early morphological hallmark of neuronal damage and has been described in a variety of pathological conditions including brain ischemia. Protection against dendritic beading is likely to reduce later neuronal damage. NMDARs are involved in mediating also cell survival, not only cell death. Increased synaptic activity triggers Ca 2 + influx via synaptic NMDAR receptors that activates a gene transcription dependent acquired neuroprotection program. Here I show that increased synaptic activity protects, in a transcription and partly nuclear calcium dependent manner, against dendritic damage. Increased synaptic activity induced gene program for acquired neuroprotection includes activating transcription factor 3 (ATF 3). I show additionally that overexpression of ATF 3 protects against NMDA-induced dendritic damage in line with its known protection against neuronal death. Furthermore, the protected dendrites are functional indicated by the restoration of synaptic transmission-dependent network activity within 48 h of an otherwise toxic NMDA insult. I conclude that ATF 3 is a robust neuroprotective gene offering protection against acute neuronal injury and hence improving the functional outcome after neuronal damage...|$|E
