40|$|Augmented <b>breaths,</b> {{also known}} as sighs, {{constitute}} the normal repertoire of breathing in freely behaving humans and animals. The <b>breaths</b> {{are believed to be}} generated by neurones in the preBötzinger complex but under modulatory influence from higher brain centres, particularly in the limbic system due to the strong correlations between the expression of emotional behaviours such as anxiety and the occurrence of augmented <b>breaths.</b> The current study examines the role of the hippocampus in the motor expression of augmented <b>breaths,</b> and also examines the characteristics of eupneic <b>breaths</b> surrounding a sigh before and after stimulating the hippocampus in urethane anaesthetised Sprague-Dawley rats. Neurochemical microstimulation using the excitatory amino acid, D,L-Homocysteic acid, was used to locate areas in the hippocampus with the potential to modulated the motor expression of augmented <b>breaths.</b> The CA 1 neurone cluster of the ventral hippocampus was found to completely suppress the expression of augmented <b>breaths</b> without affecting the intrinsic properties of the <b>breaths.</b> A similar neurone cluster, but in the dorsal field of the hippocampus, was also investigated and found to have no effects over the expression of augmented <b>breaths.</b> The data supports the hypothesis that there is a structural or functional relationship between neurones of the ventral hippocampus and brainstem nuclei that control augmented <b>breaths.</b> The implications of these findings in the context of behaviours are discussed but with due consideration of experimental conditions...|$|R

5|$|Drivers are {{not legally}} {{required}} to take field sobriety tests, although the results are admissible in court. The Alcotest has replaced the Breathalyzer as the standard device for determining blood alcohol level. When a driver is arrested for DUI, the police are prohibited from using force to obtain a <b>breath,</b> blood, or urine sample, and must warn {{the driver of the}} consequences of refusing a <b>breath</b> sample. In 2010, the New Jersey Supreme Court overturned the <b>breath</b> sample refusal conviction of a non-English speaking driver, ruling that drivers must be notified of the law in a language that they understand. A person can be charged with DUI or <b>breath</b> refusal up to 90 days after the incident, except in cases of serious injury or death, in which case the statute of limitations is 5 years.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to breathe out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous <b>breath</b> remaining within the lungs when the next <b>breath</b> is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of <b>breath</b> in COPD, as it is less comfortable to breathe in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

50|$|The {{depth and}} {{frequency}} of our breathing is determined by chemoreceptors and the brainstem, as modified {{by a number of}} subjective sensations. When ventilated, the patient breathes at a rate and tidal volume that is dictated by the machine.Because of dead space, taking deep <b>breaths</b> more slowly (e.g. ten 500 ml <b>breaths</b> per minute) is more effective than taking shallow <b>breaths</b> quickly (e.g. twenty 250 ml <b>breaths</b> per minute). Although the amount of gas per minute is the same (5 L/min), {{a large proportion of the}} shallow <b>breaths</b> is dead space, and does not allow oxygen to get into the blood.|$|R

5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{occurs when}} the opening that allows air to enter the pleural space functions as a one-way valve, allowing more air to enter with every <b>breath</b> but none to escape. The body compensates by increasing the respiratory rate and tidal volume (size of each <b>breath),</b> worsening the problem. Unless corrected, hypoxia (decreased oxygen levels) and respiratory arrest eventually follow.|$|E

5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the <b>breath</b> is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by exertion, which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the <b>breath</b> to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E
40|$|In awake rats {{a single}} {{recurrent}} larger tidal volume (deep <b>breaths)</b> occurs at regular intervals, followed by oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate. In {{the present study}} we recorded the changes in blood pressure, heart rate and ventilation during the wakefulness-sleep cycle identified by electrocorticographic records {{in order to determine}} whether the deep <b>breaths</b> and cardiovascular oscillations were associated with changes in the electrocorticogram. During several episodes of slow-wave sleep (SWS) in 7 rats the deep <b>breaths</b> and oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate were preceded by SWS desynchronization. The interval between deep <b>breaths</b> during SWS was 71 ± 4 s, the period between initial desynchronization and the generation of deep <b>breaths</b> was 3. 98 ± 0. 45 s and the duration of SWS desynchronization was 11 ± 0. 65 s. Hypotension (- 16 ± 1 mmHg) and tachycardia (+ 15 ± 5 bpm) were observed during deep <b>breaths</b> in the SWS state. These data indicate that the oscillations in arterial pressure and heart rate during SWS are associated with deep <b>breaths,</b> which in turn are preceded by desynchronization of the electrocorticogram in this state of slee...|$|R

In adults,irrespective of the number or rescuers, for every 30 chest compressions give two rescue <b>breaths</b> and in child victim, give 2 <b>breaths</b> per 30 compression if only 1 rescuer is present,but 2 <b>breaths</b> per 15 compressions in case where there are 2 rescuers.|$|R
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal <b>breath</b> to the next abnormal <b>breath,</b> a <b>breath</b> which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe it. Some of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E

30|$|Methods: 16 {{recordings}} (12  min each) of esophageal pressure (Pes), Paw {{and flow}} were obtained in obstructive (75  %) and restrictive (25  %) patients under PSV with clinical evidence of poor patient-ventilator interaction. Tracings of 4426 <b>breaths</b> were visually analyzed for detection of spontaneous respiratory activity both with Pes (reference method) and without Pes (waveform method) by different operators. <b>Breaths</b> {{were defined as}} assisted, unassisted or autotriggered, and assisted <b>breaths</b> as delayed triggered, early cycled or delayed cycled. The waveforms method was applied in a selection of tracings (20  min, 544 <b>breaths)</b> by 4 different operators for assessment of inter-rater agreement.|$|R
30|$|Results: The {{reference}} method detected 6 autotriggered (0.1  %), 976 unassisted (22.1  %) and 3444 assisted (77.8  %) breaths; among assisted <b>breaths,</b> 897 delayed triggered (26.0  %), 1231 delayed cycled (35.7  %) and 439 early cycled (12.7  %). Table 102 shows sensitivities and specificities (95  % CI) of the waveform method in evaluating patient-ventilator interaction. The waveform method detected {{the start of}} patient's inspiration and expiration with a bias of − 23 and − 32  ms and a precision (± 1.98 SD) of 184 and 202  ms respectively. Absolute agreement among operators was almost perfect for unassisted <b>breaths,</b> strong for delayed triggered, delayed cycled and early cycled <b>breaths,</b> and weak for autotriggered <b>breaths.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{pressure}} waveform is square, and {{the flow}} waveform is decelerating.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} was to establish a reliable method of measuring diaphragm movement during relaxed tidal breathing. This study follows a previous study in which test-retest reliability was established for maximal <b>breaths</b> but not for tidal <b>breaths</b> (Blaney and Sawyer 1997). Twelve normal subjects were tested in a semi-reclined long sitting position. Sonographic measurements were taken for tidal <b>breaths</b> during four different patterns of breathing. All <b>breaths</b> were controlled for inspired volume. Testing was repeated one week later under the same conditions. The results showed that the method for measuring diaphragmatic movement at tidal breathing during a given pattern of breathing was reliable. This method will allow further investigation of the diaphragm during different breathing manoeuvres at tidal volume...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Ineffective {{respiratory}} efforts during expiration (IEE) are {{a problem}} during mechanical ventilation (MV). The goal {{of this study is}} to validate mathematical algorithms that automatically detect IEE in a computerized (Better Care®) system that obtains and processes data from intensive care unit (ICU) ventilators in real time. Methods The Better Care® system, integrated with ICU health information systems, synchronizes and processes data from bedside technology. Algorithms were developed to analyze airflow waveforms during expiration to determine IEE. Data from 2, 608, 800 <b>breaths</b> from eight patients were recorded. From these <b>breaths</b> 1, 024 were randomly selected. Five experts independently analyzed the selected <b>breaths</b> and classified them as IEE or not IEE. Better Care® evaluated the same 1, 024 <b>breaths</b> and assigned a score to each one. The IEE score cutoff point was determined based on the experts’ analysis. The IEE algorithm was subsequently validated using the electrical activity of the diaphragm (EAdi) signal to analyze 9, 600 <b>breaths</b> in eight additional patients. Results Optimal sensitivity and specificity were achieved by setting the cutoff point for IEE by Better Care® at 42...|$|R
