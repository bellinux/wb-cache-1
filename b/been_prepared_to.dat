5|$|Although rodents {{have been}} {{regarded}} traditionally as herbivores, {{a number of}} species opportunistically include insects, fish, or meat in their diets and more specialized forms rely on such foods. A functional-morphological study of the rodent tooth system supports the idea that primitive rodents were omnivores rather than herbivores. Studies of the literature show that numerous members of the Sciuromorpha and Myomorpha, and {{a few members of}} the Hystricomorpha, have either included animal matter in their diets or <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> eat such food when offered it in captivity. Examination of the stomach contents of the North American white-footed mouse, normally considered to be herbivorous, showed 34% animal matter.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald also {{wished to}} secure the Colony of British Columbia. There was {{interest}} in the United States in bringing about the colony's annexation, and Macdonald wished to ensure his new nation had a Pacific outlet. The colony had an extremely large debt {{that would have to}} be assumed should it join Confederation. Negotiations were conducted in 1870, principally during Macdonald's illness and recuperation, with Cartier leading the Canadian delegation. Cartier offered British Columbia a railroad linking it to the eastern provinces within 10 years. The British Columbians, who privately had <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> accept far less generous terms, quickly agreed and joined Confederation in 1871. The Canadian Parliament ratified the terms after a debate over the high cost that cabinet member Alexander Morris described as the worst fight the Conservatives had had since Confederation.|$|E
5|$|OTU squadrons, {{according}} to GOC Bowhill, should have <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> deliver an output of three crews {{per month for}} torpedo and fighter squadrons and two for General Reconnaissance units. Only at this point did the Air Ministry revise its policy. They did so, however, in a manner which indicated it still did not appreciate {{the problems of the}} Command. Bomber Command had received several months of 'working up' and breathing space from the declaration of war to the German invasion of Western Europe, but Coastal Command had not. Furthermore, Bomber Command was given permission to merge several new squadrons into OTUs. It seemed as if Bomber Command was still receiving better treatment.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{the town}} was {{disarmed}} and order restored, with the gambling equipment and weapons confiscated, and the saloons closed down. Hobbs then left Lawson in charge and caught the 4:00 p.m. train out of town that same day. The residents did not openly resist Hobbs or the militia, although nearly all were armed and had <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> offer non-violent resistance. She stopped at the county seat in Baker City to officially remove the town's officials {{in front of a}} judge before returning to the state capitol in Salem. The Baker County Circuit Court quickly enjoined the militia from holding the town under martial law; Sheriff Rand began assembling a posse to carry out the court order. Governor West requested a hearing, seeking Rand's temporary removal from office, and appointed Hobbs to represent the State as special counsel.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{concentrated}} their riposte {{against the}} central column. Herff—who had <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> fall back—instead launched a local counter-attack toward Fort Capuzzo {{during the afternoon}} of 15 May with the 2nd Battalion Panzer Regiment5. At around 13:30, DCompany 1DLI at the landing ground was overrun, and with no anti-tank support more capable than the Boys anti-tank rifle, the remaining troops of 1DLI were forced to fall back toward Musaid. A fortuitous dust cloud aided their withdrawal, but by 14:45 Panzer Regiment5 was reporting that it had recaptured Capuzzo, inflicting heavy casualties on the British and taking 70 prisoners.|$|E

US official and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons determined that Pakistani allegations of India using banned chemicals in its bombs were unfounded.|$|E
25|$|Progress Party leader Siv Jensen {{stated that}} her party {{would not support}} a {{coalition}} government in which it did not participate, thus apparently ruling out a minority coalition of the Conservatives, the Liberals and the Christian Democrats, like the government of Kjell Magne Bondevik which was in office from 2001 to 2005. She also stated that the Progress Party would have <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> form a minority government alone if the party won more seats in parliament than the other three non-socialist parties.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{the case}} of many other Latin American cities where the private sector was asked to provide services, the Chilean service {{providers}} were financially self-sufficient when the private sector took responsibility for them. The public companies had <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> gradually improve efficiency and profitability since the legal reforms of 1988-1990. This may explain the stable process of private sector participation compared to other Latin American cases. A factor that explains the continuity of sector policies during various administrations is the fact that all Presidents since Chile's return to democracy in 1990 belonged to the same Coalition of Parties for Democracy.|$|E

25|$|But {{during her}} mature prime in the 1870s and '80s, Patti {{had been a}} more enterprising singer, proving to be an {{effective}} actress in those lyric roles that required the summoning forth of deep emotions, such as Gilda in Rigoletto, Leonora in Il trovatore, the title part in Semiramide, Zerlina in Don Giovanni and Violetta in La traviata. She also had <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> tackle quite dramatic parts in operas like L'Africaine, Les Huguenots and even Aida. She never attempted to sing any verismo parts, however, because these became popular only in the twilight of her career, during the final decade of the 19th century.|$|E
25|$|Attlee {{remained}} as Leader of the Opposition when the Second World War {{broke out in}} September 1939. The ensuing disastrous Norwegian Campaign {{would result in a}} motion of no confidence in Neville Chamberlain. Although Chamberlain survived this, the reputation of his administration was so badly and publicly damaged that it became clear a coalition government would be necessary. Even if Attlee had personally <b>been</b> <b>prepared</b> <b>to</b> serve under Chamberlain in an emergency coalition government, he would never have been able to carry Labour with him. Consequently, Chamberlain tendered his resignation, and Labour and the Conservatives entered a coalition government led by Winston Churchill on 10 May 1940.|$|E

However, patient Jan Morris wrote that Burou did not bother too much with diagnosis or previous treatment. Burou later confirmed {{that he did not}} ask his patients too many questions, but sought to fulfil their wishes, and that he did restrict his services to male-to-female (MTF) transsexuals with a distinct “feminine” appearance or character. He refused his services to minors even if they had parental consent, because he felt “the operation is definitive and irreversible and one… could not risk making a mistake.” His international patients were often admitted the afternoon they arrived at the clinic, and were prepared for surgery as soon as that evening or the next morning.|$|E

These leaders had ceased their actions after warnings from {{the police and the}} ISD. One incident involved a Muslim religious leader who had urged Muslims to vote for Muslim candidates with deep religious beliefs at the 1991 general election; he was given a warning in 1992. In the same year, a Christian pastor was cautioned for using church publications and sermons to criticize Buddhism, Taoism and Roman Catholicism. In 1995, another Muslim religious leader was warned for having called a Hindu belief that statues of Ganesha could drink milk offerings the work of Satan.|$|E
