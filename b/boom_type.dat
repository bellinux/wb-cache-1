50|$|There {{are three}} types of 'fixed boom' grapple skidders. A single-function <b>boom</b> <b>type</b> has two {{hydraulic}} cylinders, only allowing the boom to lower in one position. Dual-function booms (as pictured) have four cylinders, which allows for adjusting the boom in two different places. The third type permits the grapple boom to be swung from side to side, allowing spread out trees to be grabbed at once.|$|E
50|$|The MOMBA 2C had a pod and <b>boom</b> <b>type</b> fuselage. The pilot's {{seat was}} just {{forward of the}} wing leading edge, placing him in a {{reclining}} position under a long, single piece canopy, shaped from an uncut Slingsby Kestrel moulding. The cockpit had some unusual features, principally that access to it was by rolling the whole nosecone and canopy forwards along a rail from a join around the fuselage ahead of the wing. This provided an aerodynamically very clean and well sealed forward fuselage, as well as easy access for instrument panel servicing. The control column was side mounted on a raised side beam on the right; flap and undercarriage levers were similarly mounted on the other side. This arrangement avoided underfloor control cables, keeping the fuselage cross section low and simplifying the control linkages. The cockpit was narrow and low {{and would not have}} been comfortable for bigger pilots than Sunderland. The nosecone was skinned with glass cloth over balsa. Instrument panel, controls, seat and the retractable monowheel undercarriage were supported by a central, sturdy, sheet alloy frame linked to the wing. The fuselage tapered from the leading edge aft, an area covered glass cloth over PVC foam. Behind this the boom was a roughly oval metal tube, with flat top and bottom plates for ease of construction. Tail surfaces were all straight edged; the tall, metal skinned fin had a slightly swept GRP leading edge and carried a tapered, fabric covered rudder. The MOMBA 2C had a T-tail, with a metal surfaced, high aspect ratio, tapered tailplane and a plywood surfaced elevator. There was a small, semi-recessed tailwheel below the fin.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{investigation of}} the planar deployment and lock-up of two flexible <b>boom</b> <b>type</b> appendages which have attached tip masses and are connected to a central rigid body through a rotational spring is presented. Nondimensional parameters are identified and it is shown that, in general, the solution depends only on two mass ratios and one nondimensional stiffness parameter. Results are presented for boom tip deflections, deployment time and root moments at lock-up. A threshold value of the nondimensional stiffness parameter is identified beyond which boom deflections become large. Also, a thorough examination {{of the effect of}} nonlinear terms in the equations governing the deployment phase is performed. Nonlinear terms in the deployment equations due to kinematics and structural deformation are required to predict more accurately boom deflections, but retention of an inconsistent set of nonlinear terms leads to erroneous results. In particular, retaining nonlinear kinematic terms while neglecting nonlinear structural terms can produce inaccurate results even below the threshold stiffness value...|$|E

40|$|Ship-mounted cranes {{are used}} to {{transfer}} cargo from large container ships to smaller lighters when deep-water ports are not available. The wave-induced motion of the crane ship produces large pendulations of hoisted cargo and causes operations to be suspended. In this work, we show that in <b>boom</b> <b>type</b> ship-mounted cranes, {{it is possible to}} reduce these pendulations signicantly by controlling the slew and lu angles of the boom. Such a control can be achieved with the heavy equipment that is already part of the crane so that retrotting existing cranes would require a small eort. Moreover, the control is superimposed on the commands of the operator transparently. The successful control strategy is based on delayed-position feedback of the cargo motion in-plane and out-of-plane of the boom and crane tower. Its eectiveness is demonstrated with a fully nonlinear three-dimensional computer simulation and with an experiment on a 1 / 24 scale model of a T-ACS (The Auxiliary Crane Ship) crane mounted on a platform moving with three degrees of freedom to simulate the ship roll, pitch, and heave motions of the crane ship. The results demonstrate that the pendulations can be signicantly reduced, and therefore the range of sea conditions in which cargo-transfer operations could take place can be greatly expanded...|$|E
40|$|In {{the era of}} financialisation, {{increasing}} {{income inequality}} could be observed in most developed and many developing countries. Despite these similar developments in inequality, the growth performance and drivers for growth differed markedly among countries, allowing clusters of different growth regimes to be identified. Among them two extreme types: the debt-led private-demand <b>boom</b> <b>type</b> and the export-led mercantilist type. Whereas the former relies mainly on creditfinanced household consumption in order {{to compensate for the}} potential lack of demand (associated with the depressing effect of financialisation), the latter relies on net exports as the main driver of aggregate demand. After a short review of the different channels through which financialisation is expected to affect a countries development, a theoretical discussion on the conditions that tend to support the occurrence of either of the two regimes will build the base for the following model exercise. With the help of a stock-flow consistent model it will be demonstrated then how increasing inequality, depending on a countries institutional structure and regulatory framework, affects growth differently, explaining the occurrence of both regime types. Based on the insights of the theoretical discussion and the model results, a foresight exercise will be performed examining how further increase in inequality might affect development of economies around the world but particularly of the Euro area...|$|E
40|$|Agricultural {{machinery}} is {{an important}} source of emission of air pollutant in rural locations. Emissions of a specific tractor engine mainly depend on engine speed. Various driving methods and use of implements with different work capacities can affect the engine load. This study deals with the effects of types of tractors and operation conditions on engine emission. In this study two types of agricultural tractors (MF 285 and U 650) and some tillage implements such as centrifugal type spreader, <b>boom</b> <b>type</b> sprayer and rotary tiller were employed. Some of the exhausted gases from both tractors in each condition were measured such as, hydrocarbon (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), oxygen (O 2) and nitrogen oxide (NO). Engine oil temperature was measured at every step for both types of tractors. Difference between steady-state condition and operation conditions was evaluated. The results showed all exhaust gases that measured and engine oil temperature at every operation conditions are higher than steady-state condition. A general conclusion of the work was that, using various implements and employing different types of tractors effect on engine emissions. The results of variance analysis showed all exhausted gases had a significant relationship with types of implements used at 1 %. Also, all exhausted gases except CO had a significant relationship with types of tractors. A further conclusion was that NO emission increased as engine oil temperature increased. The final conclusion was about the difference between MF 285 and U 650; using U 650 at operation conditions is better than MF 285 in terms of pollution...|$|E

40|$|Rivers play an {{important}} role in providing the water resources for human and ecosystem survival and health. Nowadays, most urban areas experience difficulties in solving water pollution in rivers and streams. Hence, a proper solution should be carried out to overcome this problem. The objective of this research is to study an effective floating debris boom which can be created with appropriate dimensions, as well as good level of effectiveness of material in various flow rates, in a rectangular open channel to reduce the river pollution. In this research, there are two types of connection, hinged or drilled hole that will be used to connect the piers and the <b>booms.</b> Three <b>types</b> of material were used which are Styrofoam, bamboo, and PVC. Total six booms were created and tested with five different flow rates. An amount of 200 g of debris was put into the open channel to test the floating debris boom. The results indicated that hinged connection is stronger than drilled-hole connection to connect the piers and the booms as it provided a free movement for the boom to move. For the type of material, Styrofoam proved that it has the best effectiveness for capturing the debris due to its lighter weight among the three materials. Based on the data obtained, floating debris boom which is made from Styrofoam and connected by hinged connection has the best performance and effectiveness for capturing the debris in this experiment.

40|$|A {{document}} discusses lightweight instrument booms {{under development}} for use aboard spacecraft. A <b>boom</b> of this <b>type</b> comprises a thin-walled graphite fiber/ matrix composite tube with an integral hinge {{that can be}} bent for stowage and later allowed to spring back to straighten the boom for deployment in outer space. The boom design takes advantage of both the stiffness of the composite in tubular geometry and the flexibility of thin sections of the composite. The hinge is formed by machining windows in the tube at diametrically opposite locations so that there remain two opposing cylindrical strips resembling measuring tapes. Essential to the design is a proprietary composite layup that renders the hinge tough yet flexible enough to be bendable as much as 90 in either of two opposite directions. When the boom is released for deployment, the torque exerted by the bent hinge suffices to overcome parasitic resistance from harnesses and other equipment, so that the two sections of the hinge snap to a straight, rigid condition {{in the same manner}} as that of measuring tapes. Issues addressed in development thus far include selection of materials, out-of-plane bending, edge cracking, and separation of plies...|$|R

We took into account spray deposits, fall armyworm control and crop corn performance in a narrow row cropping system. The experiment was carried out at the experimental area of Sao Paulo State University, Botucatu/SP, Brazil, during the 2008 / 2009 agricultural season, in randomized blocks with a factorial scheme (2 × 2 + 1) and four replications. Two spray nozzles (flat fan nozzle and hollow cone nozzle) were tested, combined with two air assistance levels in the spray boom (with and without air assistance) and a treatment control. In the experimental spraying, Spinosad insecticide was sprayed in amounts of 48 g active substance (a. s.) /ha. The air assistance in the spray boom increased the spray deposits in the V 4 growth stage of the corn plants. Moreover, the application of this technology showed higher efficiency on fall armyworm control, reaching a 100 % level 15 days after spraying, in the V 10 growth stage of the plants. The hollow cone nozzle increased the spray deposit level on the corn plants compared with the flat fan nozzle, at growth stage V 4. However, the flat fan nozzle, combined with air assistance technology, was more effective for controlling fall armyworm in the same growth stage (V 4), although the hollow cone nozzle increased the deposit levels on the plants.

40|$|Millions of cranes {{are used}} around the world. Because of their wide-spread use in {{construction}} industries, boom cranes {{are an important}} class of cranes whose performance should be optimized. One limitation of most boom cranes is they are usually attached to a stationary base or a mobile base that is only used for initial positioning and not during operation. This limits the workspace of the boom crane significantly. If a boom crane was attached to a mobile base that could be safely used during lifting operations, then the boom crane workspace could be extended significantly. The problem with using cranes, and in particular mobile cranes, is the large oscillations of the payload that are typically induced when moving the crane. One control strategy {{that has been used}} to control oscillation on other types of cranes is called Input Shaping, a command filtering technique that reduces motion-induced vibration in oscillatory systems. This thesis develops a dynamics model for a mobile boom crane and analyzes the difficulty of controlling payload oscillation on a boom crane. Input shaping will shown to be effective for controlling oscillation on boom cranes. A new method for operating a boom crane in Cartesian coordinates will also be shown. This thesis will also detail the design of a small-scale mobile boom crane for experimental and research purposes. A substantial part of this thesis will also focus on the development of new input-shaping methods for nonlinear drive systems commonly found on <b>boom</b> and other <b>types</b> of cranes. An example application of a control system featuring input shaping for an industrial bridge crane will also be discussed. M. S.
