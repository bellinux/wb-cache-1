5|$|Bush {{continued}} to remain involved and concerned {{over the state}} of women in Afghanistan, speaking out editorials and appearances during 2013 that the women and girls who had been helped could not <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> {{during and after the}} planned withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the encirclement of the 6th Army on 23 November 1942, the Geschwaderstab was moved to Morozovskaya-West, outside the Stalingrad pocket. Wilcke organized fighter escort missions for the transport aircraft delivering supplies for the 6th Army. Pressed by the advancing Soviet armored spearheads, Morozovskaya-West had to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> by the Geschwaderstab on 23 December, and the aircraft were moved to Morozovskaya-South, which was not yet threatened by the Soviet Army. On 3 January 1943, this airfield had to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> as well and the Geschwaderstab was relocated to Tazinskaya, there it remained until the fighting over the Stalingrad pocket ended. During this period the Geschwaderstab claimed 25 victories, 21 by Wilcke and 4 by Dahl, for the loss in action of two pilots.|$|E

5|$|The {{site was}} divided into squares and {{excavations}} were undertaken in straight lines: archaeology was becoming rationalised, {{and it was in}} this way that the location of the temple of Zeus was determined. The simple chase after treasure was beginning to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} way to detect an eruption is studying Silverthrone's geological history since every volcano {{has its own}} pattern of behavior, {{in terms of its}} eruption style, magnitude and frequency, so that its future eruption is expected to be similar to its previous eruptions. But this would likely <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> {{in part because of the}} volcano's remoteness.|$|E
5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars had to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned,</b> and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, {{the best known}} of which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations continue to be a popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E
5000|$|The 1990 edition <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> {{because of}} snow. The 1995 edition <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> because of frost. The 2001 running {{took place at}} Newbury. The 2008 edition <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> because of heavy rain.|$|R

5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Col. Alexander, chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> entirely (third-class). Fort Corcoran fell into the third-class category.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit provoked a drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Monkridden No.1 {{coal seam}} <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> before 1879 and No.2, Wee coal and {{limestone}} {{was still working}} in 1877. Goldcraig's limestone quarry closed in 1891 and the Wee coal working <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> in 1927. Lylestone had Wee coal and fire-clay workings. The upper quarries <b>were</b> <b>abandoned</b> in 1918.|$|R
5|$|By 1929, the {{phenomenon}} of beta decay prompted Bohr to again suggest that the law of conservation of energy <b>be</b> <b>abandoned,</b> but Enrico Fermi's hypothetical neutrino and the subsequent 1932 discovery of the neutron provided another explanation. This prompted Bohr {{to create a new}} theory of the compound nucleus in 1936, which explained how neutrons could be captured by the nucleus. In this model, the nucleus could be deformed like a drop of liquid. He worked on this with a new collaborator, the Danish physicist Fritz Kalckar, who died suddenly in 1938.|$|E
5|$|Early {{reports on}} the {{centrifugal}} method indicated {{that it was not}} as efficient as predicted. Urey suggested that a more efficient but technically more complicated countercurrent system be used instead of the previous flow-through method. By November 1941, technical obstacles seemed formidable enough for the process to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned.</b> Countercurrent centrifuges were developed after the war, and today are the favored method in many countries.|$|E
5|$|In 1644, Giovanni de’ Medici {{proposed}} that Fort St. Angelo in Birgu <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> {{and a new}} fort be constructed on Orsi Point. The new fort would have been also called Fort St. Angelo, and would be manned with the garrison of the old fort. He drew up plans for the proposed fort, but they were never implemented.|$|E
50|$|The {{section of}} the line between Chester and York <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> around 1972. The section from York to Clover <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> in 1981.

5000|$|The race <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> in 1991 due to frost. Due to {{the closure}} of Ascot Racecourse for redevelopment, the race was {{switched}} to Windsor in 2004. The race (to be held at Windsor) <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> in 2005 due to frost. The race <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> in 2009 and 2010 due to snow.|$|R
50|$|All these matches <b>were</b> <b>abandoned</b> {{because of}} bad weather, except for the match in 1914 which <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> because of the {{impending}} war.|$|R
5|$|In 1853 the Royal Society's {{project was}} concluded, and the {{observatory}} {{was set to}} <b>be</b> <b>abandoned.</b> After a lengthy debate, the fledgling colonial government decided to take over its operation. Rather than disappearing like its three counterparts, the Toronto observatory was upgraded, and its mission was expanded as it became a meteorological station (see Meteorological Service of Canada) {{under the direction of}} the Ministry of Marine and Fisheries. During the expansion, the original buildings were replaced with a permanent structure.|$|E
5|$|In August 1941 an {{artillery}} unit {{was formed to}} attack Italian forts more effectively. Initially it used a QF 4.5-inch howitzer carried on a 10-ton Mack NR 4 truck, with an accompanying light tank as an armoured observation post. However, these were {{handed over to the}} Free French at Kufra. The unit was then issued a 25 pounder portee. The LRDG successfully attacked and captured the fort at El Gtafia using the gun, but later the truck had to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> and the experiment ended.|$|E
5|$|In October 2013 Liverpool City Council {{approved}} {{the acquisition of}} the Cunard Building for use as offices and as a cruise liner terminal. The council projected that the building would accommodate 1000 staff relocated from Millennium House and leases in the Capital Building, saving an estimated £1.3 million. The anticipated use as cruise terminal however had to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> due to the high costs associated with security and border control.|$|E

5|$|Losses for 12 July are {{difficult}} to establish for either combatant. Tank losses attributed to the German side vary, {{in part due to}} the Wehrmacht's methodology for counting and reporting equipment losses. Only equipment that could not be repaired or that had to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> were counted as losses, but damaged equipment that could be recovered and repaired were simply listed as such. Likewise, reliable figures for tank and personnel casualties for the Red Army in the Battle of Prokhorovka {{are difficult}} to establish.|$|E
5|$|Major General Auguste Gilliaert {{arrived from}} the Congo {{before the end of}} the month. On 27 June General William Platt, {{advancing}} with British forces from Sudan, ordered the Belgians to attack the Italian positions if an opportunity presented itself and Gilliaert immediately undertook preparations for an offensive. The plans for taking Mogi were to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> and the Belgians were to concentrate their efforts against Saïo and all but 50 of the soldiers besieging it were redeployed.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 15 May SS-Standarte Deutschland {{approached}} the Zanddijk Position. A first attack around 08:00 on outposts of the northern sector was easily repulsed, as the Germans had to advance over a narrow dike through the inundations, despite supporting air strikes by dive bombers. However, the bombardment caused the battalions in the main positions to flee, and the entire line had to <b>be</b> <b>abandoned</b> around 14:00 despite the southern part being supported by the French torpedo boat L'Incomprise.|$|E
50|$|Central Dunedin {{was still}} {{occupied}} about 1785 but <b>was</b> <b>abandoned</b> before 1826. Pūrākaunui and Mapoutahi <b>were</b> <b>abandoned</b> {{late in the}} 18th century and Whareakeake about 1825.|$|R
