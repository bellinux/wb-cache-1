5|$|Aether is a {{video game}} {{designed}} by Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel and published by Armor Games, released on September 3, 2008. Players control a lonely boy and an octopus-like monster that the boy encounters, solving puzzles on different planets to restore them from monochrome to color. The pair travel through space <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> on clouds and asteroids with the monster's elongated tongue, searching other planets for life to which the boy can relate. It is {{also a part of}} The Basement Collection.|$|E

The infantry divisions were to continue their attack <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> north–east, pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E

5|$|Like John Filson, Timothy Flint also interviewed Boone, and his Biographical Memoir of Daniel Boone, the First Settler of Kentucky (1833) {{became one}} of the best-selling biographies of the 19th century. Flint greatly embellished Boone's adventures, doing for Boone what Parson Weems did for George Washington. In Flint's book, Boone fought hand-to-paw with a bear, escaped from Indians <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> on vines (as Tarzan would later do), and so on. Although Boone's family thought the book was absurd, Flint greatly {{influenced}} the popular conception of Boone, since these tall tales were recycled in countless dime novels and books aimed at young boys.|$|E
5|$|After {{the cavalry}} {{breakthrough}} on the coast, the XXI Corps would advance {{to capture the}} headquarters of the Ottoman Eighth Army at Tulkarm and cut the railway lines. Sections of the lateral rail line in the Judean Hills between Tulkarm and Nablus and a branch of the Jezreel Valley railway, were to be denied to the Seventh and Eighth Ottoman Armies. These lines, including the important railway junction at Messudieh, transported their supplies into the Judean Hills. The British infantry divisions were to continue their attack <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> north–east, pivoting on their right to push the defenders back out of their trenches away from the coast and back into the Judean Hills towards Messudieh.|$|E
5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword {{movements}} are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a forward thrust and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E

5|$|Late in the 1999–2000 season, Niedermayer was {{involved}} in a violent incident with Peter Worell of the Florida Panthers. After being elbowed by Worell, Niedermayer responded <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> his stick at his opponents head. Worell suffered a concussion and missed six games, while Niedermayer was suspended for ten games – nine in the regular season, and New Jersey's first playoff game. After returning from his ban, Niedermayer's steady defensive contributions in the playoffs helped the Devils win their second Stanley Cup by defeating the Dallas Stars in six games in the 2000 Stanley Cup Final. While celebrating his day with the Cup, Niedermayer took the trophy to Fisher Peak, overlooking his hometown of Cranbrook and was famously pictured hoisting it over his head.|$|E
5|$|Lavelli {{initially}} {{planned to}} retire in 1955 but came back for a final year in 1956, when the Browns posted a 5–7 record, the team's first-ever losing season. In his 11-year career, Lavelli caught 386 passes for 6,488 yards and 62 touchdowns. He was a confident receiver, former teammates said in later years. He could often be heard calling for Graham to throw him the ball while running routes. He was also known {{for his ability to}} improvise on the field. In a 1955 game against the Eagles in slippery conditions, he caught the winning touchdown with less than a minute left <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> around the goalpost with his arm to get open.|$|E
5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In order to do so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a piece of evidence that contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of exclamation marks are shown; if the player presents an incorrect piece of evidence, one of the exclamation marks disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E

5|$|Nintendo {{collaborated with}} the Lawn Tennis Association in 2005 to promote Power Tennis in the United Kingdom. The {{promotion}} featured on-site sampling and official Nintendo branding at various tennis events such as Wimbledon. The LTA's ACE Magazine advertised Power Tennis and featured competitions offering the game as a prize. Nintendo also released an online questionnaire regarding players' habits and preferences in relation to tennis {{as a part of}} their Who Are You? campaign. Nintendo announced in 2008 that they would be re-releasing the title as part of their New Play Control! selection, which feature added Wii controls. The game can be controlled using the Wii Remote and optional Nunchuk attachment, allowing the player to trigger actions such as forehands and backhands <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> the Remote like a tennis racket. It was released on January 15, 2009 in Japan and on March 2009 in other countries. It was later re-released in North America on June 10, 2012 along with Pikmin 2 as Nintendo Selects titles.|$|E
5|$|The {{nominate}} population, {{especially in}} Africa, {{is known for}} its use of stones as tools. When a large egg, such as that of an ostrich or bustard, is located, the bird walks up to it with a large pebble held in its bill and tosses the pebble <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> the neck down over the egg. The operation is repeated until the egg cracks from the blows. They prefer using rounded pebbles to jagged rocks. This behaviour, although it was believed that it was first reported by Jane Goodall in 1966, it was actually already known to Africans and was first reported by J. G. Wood in 1877. However, this has only been reported in Africa and has not been recorded in N. p. ginginianus. Tests with both hand-reared and wild birds suggest that the behaviour is innate, not learnt by observing other birds, and displayed once they associate eggs with food and have access to pebbles. Another case of tool-use described from Bulgaria involves the use of a twig as a tool to roll up and gather strands of wool to use for lining the nest.|$|E

50|$|Contrarily to {{what the}} name could seem to suggest, its sound is not {{inspired}} <b>by</b> <b>swing</b> music, only Franco-Ontarian folklore, which is adapted with techno music. The name comes from the Quebec French term Swinger, meaning in this context to dance, and the phrase Swing la bacaisse dans le fond d'la boîte à bois!, a classic, almost cliché expression used in Quebec folk music parties.|$|R
50|$|Dansband ("dance band") or Danseband (Norwegian and Danish) is a Swedish {{term for}} a band that plays dansbandsmusik ("dance band music"). Dansbandsmusik is often danced to in pairs. Jitterbug and foxtrot music are often {{included}} in this category. The music is primarily inspired <b>by</b> <b>swing,</b> schlager, country, jazz, and rock. The main influence for rock-oriented bands is the rock music of the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R

25|$|A {{bell tower}} {{may have a}} single bell, or a {{collection}} of bells which are tuned to a common scale. They may be stationary and chimed, rung randomly <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> through a small arc, or swung through a full circle to enable {{the high degree of}} control of English change ringing. They may house a carillon or chimes, in which the bells are sounded by hammers connected via cables to a keyboard. These can be found in many churches and secular buildings in Europe and America including college and university campuses.|$|E
25|$|After {{receiving}} fresh {{information regarding}} Ottoman deployments on 10 April, Dobell modified {{his plan to}} incorporate a more flexible approach. While the first stage would remain unchanged, during {{the second stage of}} the battle he might attack directly <b>by</b> <b>swinging</b> his line slightly northeast, with only one division attacking Gaza to create a gap for Desert Column, depending on whether the hostile Atawineh defences were reinforced by units from the Hareira detachment. Or he might send most of his force to the coastal side of Gaza to make an attack there.|$|E
5000|$|Collegiate Shag (or [...] "Shag") is done {{primarily}} to uptempo swing and sometimes pre-swing jazz music (185-200+ beats per minute).
