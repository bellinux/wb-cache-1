2500|$|Soapy's {{last words}} were [...] "My God, don't shoot!" [...] A letter from Sam Steele, the legendary {{head of the}} Canadian Mounties at the time, {{indicates}} that another guard, Jesse Murphy, may have fired the fatal shot.

2500|$|The Irish {{were known}} for their [...] "collar-and-elbow" [...] style, in which wrestlers {{at the start of}} the match would grasp each other by the collar with one hand and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> with the other. From this position, wrestlers sought to achieve a fall. If no fall occurred, the wrestlers would {{continue}} grappling both standing on their feet and on the ground until a fall was made. Irish immigrants later brought this style to the United States where it soon became widespread. There was also what became known as [...] "catch-as-catch-can" [...] wrestling, which had a particular following in Great Britain and the variant developed in Lancashire had a particular effect on future freestyle wrestling in particular.|$|E

2500|$|De Gaulle {{hosted a}} superpower summit on 17 May 1960 for arms {{limitation}} talks and détente {{efforts in the}} wake of the 1960 U-2 incident between United States President Dwight Eisenhower, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev, and United Kingdom Prime Minister Harold Macmillan. De Gaulle's warm relations with Eisenhower were noticed by United States military observers at that time. De Gaulle told Eisenhower: [...] "Obviously you cannot apologize but you must decide how you wish to handle this. I will do everything I can to be helpful without being openly partisan." [...] When Khrushchev condemned the United States U-2 flights, de Gaulle expressed to Khrushchev his disapproval of 18 near-simultaneous secret Soviet satellite overflights of French territory; Khrushchev denied knowledge of the satellite overflights. Lieutenant General Vernon A. Walters wrote that after Khrushchev left, [...] "De Gaulle came over to Eisenhower and took him by the arm. He took me also <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> and, taking us a little apart, he said to Eisenhower, 'I do not know what Khrushchev is going to do, nor what is going to happen, but whatever he does, I want you to know that I am with you to the end.' I was astounded at this statement, and Eisenhower was clearly moved by his unexpected expression of unconditional support". General Walters was struck by de Gaulle's [...] "unconditional support" [...] of the United States during that [...] "crucial time". De Gaulle then tried to revive the talks by inviting all the delegates to another conference at the Élysée Palace to discuss the situation, but the summit ultimately dissolved {{in the wake of}} the U-2 incident.|$|E

60|$|Ortheris began {{singing a}} parody of The Ramrod Corps, full of cheerful allusions to battle, murder, and sudden death. He looked out across the river as he sang; {{and his face was}} quite strange to me. Mulvaney caught me <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>elbow</b> to ensure attention.|$|E
60|$|Now he {{once more}} {{took hold of}} Armand <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>elbow,</b> but quite gently, more like a comrade who is glad to have met another, and is {{preparing}} to enjoy a pleasant conversation for a while.

60|$|When we {{got down}} into the area I felt indescribably foolish literally, as the saying is, in a hole.

I was just about to turn back when Rupert caught me <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>elbow.</b>|$|E

50|$|One of the 'True Eleven', {{her power}} is glamour (specifically vanishing, like Barry).

She often gets Barry into trouble in lessons, but never gets into trouble as much herself, due to the ability to look innocent. In the last book, Gideon claims that she is attracted to Dax as she is seen staring at him and blushes whenever he comes nearby.|$|R
