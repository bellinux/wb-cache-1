5|$|According to Herodotus, an Athenian runner named Pheidippides {{was sent}} to run from Athens to Sparta to ask for {{assistance}} before the battle. He ran a distance of over 225 kilometers (140 miles), arriving in Sparta {{the day after he}} left. Then, following the battle, the Athenian army marched the 40 kilometers (25 miles) or so back to Athens at a very high pace (considering the quantity of armour, and the fatigue after the battle), in order to head off the Persian force sailing around Cape Sounion. They arrived <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> afternoon, {{in time to see the}} Persian ships turn away from Athens, thus completing the Athenian victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{town council}} (a parish council {{with the status}} of a town) has {{responsibility}} for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The town council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic; their role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The town council has a reception and offices in the guildhall. The building was built in 1834 as a corn exchange, replacing an earlier 16th-century building that used to be situated perpendicular to where the current road is in the high street outside the Phoenix Hotel, a dig of the high street <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1980s revealed the original footprint of the old guildhall. The new re-modeled Guildhall is a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
25|$|A {{high-speed}} rail running at 300km/h (186mph) to link Kuala Lumpur and Singapore was proposed in 2006 by YTL Corporation, operator of the KLIA Express in Malaysia, {{although the company}} did propose a similar system <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1990s. A Bangkok - Kuala Lumpur - Singapore line spanning the three nations has been suggested previously, though no action has been taken. Plans for the project were put on hold in April 2008 due to high cost to the government, estimated at about RM8 billion. The project also faces opposition from rail operator rivals such as Keretapi Tanah Melayu, and the liberalisation of the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore air route further dampened prospects for the proposal.|$|E
50|$|Amongst {{the singers}} whose work he <b>backed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1940s were Sammy Davis Jr., Ella Mae Morse and, {{as part of}} a group called Ten Cats & A Mouse, Peggy Lee.|$|R
50|$|He backed King {{for fifteen}} years before King relocated, after which Stroger stopped playing {{for a couple of}} years. His {{interest}} was rekindled when he was recommended to Otis Rush, whom he <b>backed</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1970s and 1980s. He toured Europe with Rush and played on two of his albums, Live in Europe and Lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Blues.|$|R
50|$|In 1910 {{only a part}} of {{the west}} pagoda (South Korean National Treasure No. 11) was still standing. <b>In</b> 1914, <b>the</b> Japanese {{government}} supported it with a concrete <b>backing.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 20th century, Korean archaeologists conducted extensive excavations, laying the foundation for a partial reconstruction and the interpretive center. The west stone pagoda's concrete support has been removed beginning <b>in</b> 1999, and <b>the</b> entire structure was dismantled. It is undergoing restoration, expected to be completed in 2017.|$|R
25|$|The band {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the results, which they felt lacked personality, perhaps because of the reliance on session musicians. This led to the most dramatic change of style the band would attempt, when they teamed up with Giorgio Moroder, dropped the rock-group format altogether and produced the disco record No.1 in Heaven which relied on synthesizers. This album is regarded as a landmark in the development of electronic music and greatly influenced bands which would emerge in the following years. They soon returned to a more traditional line-up, which remained until 1988's Interior Design. There then followed a long hiatus until 1994's Gratuitous Sax & Senseless Violins, which was a foray into the techno dance world, which they had helped to spawn <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1970s.|$|E
25|$|While the {{achievements}} of space programs run by the main Asian space players (China, India, and Japan) {{pale in comparison to}} the milestones set by the former Soviet Union and the United States, some experts believe Asia may soon lead the world in space exploration. China has been the leader of Asia's space race {{since the beginning of the}} 21st century. The first Chinese manned spaceflight, in 2003, marked the beginning of a space race in the region. At the same time, the existence of a space race in Asia is still debated due to the non-concurrence of space milestone events like there was for the United States and the Soviet Union. Japan for example was the first power on Earth to get a sample return mission from an asteroid. There was however some concurrence between China and India to see which of those two could be the first to launch a probe to the Earth's moon <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 2000s decade. China, for example, denies that there is an Asian space race.|$|E
25|$|After the 1947 season, Feller {{organized}} another {{all-star team}} for a barnstorming tour. This time, Paige was {{not invited to}} tour with him, with Feller opting to play more games in the South against white opponents. Paige did face Feller twice, however, while playing with Chet Brewer's Kansas City Royals in Los Angeles. In the first game, on October 15, both pitchers went four innings. Feller gave up four hits and one walk and struck out two, while Paige gave up just two hits and one walk and struck out seven. Nevertheless, Paige took the loss when he gave up a run in the fourth when Keltner singled and later scored on a sacrifice fly by Heath. On October 19, they again faced each other {{in front of a}} crowd of 12,000-plus. Both pitchers went five innings. Paige allowed three hits and no walks, and struck out eight, including Ralph Kiner twice. He left the game with a 1–0 lead, but Feller's team came <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> innings to win 2–1.|$|E

500|$|M-17 is a [...] state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the U.S. state of Michigan, connecting {{the cities of}} Ypsilanti and Ann Arbor in Washtenaw County. It was once part of a highway that spanned the southern Lower Peninsula of Michigan before {{the creation of the}} U.S. Highway System in 1926. The designation once extended into downtown Detroit, but the eastern terminus was progressively scaled <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1960s to the current location in Ypsilanti. The changes made to the highways in Washtenaw County spawned Business M-17 (Bus. M-17), a business loop for 11years between 1945 and 1956.|$|E
500|$|Another T206 Wagner card {{owned by}} two Cincinnati men was {{dismissed}} as a fake by Bill Mastro and PSA president Joe Orlando. The two men, John Cobb and Ray Edwards, have tried to prove that their Piedmont-backed card is not a fake and, due to its excellent condition, should fetch over $1 million in an auction. Cobb and Edwards also have alleged {{that they have been}} dismissed because they are inner city black men in a hobby that has been dominated by successful white men. Cobb, like Mastro <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1980s, does not divulge the exact details of how he came to own the card. He has stated he purchased the card at an estate sale for $1,800 in 1983 or 1984, a bargain for the card at that time. When Cobb and Edwards tried to sell the card on eBay in 2002, a Newport, Kentucky attorney filed a police report against the two men because he believed the card was a reprint that was stolen from his office months earlier. The police launched an investigation, but found no evidence of wrongdoing. An outraged Edwards dismissed the accusations as [...] "bullshit," [...] adding that they would not have been made [...] "if we were white." ...|$|E
500|$|... 52 was {{promoted}} as a comic that {{would attempt to}} incorporate as many DC Comics characters as possible. In a Q session hosted by Newsarama.com, 52 editor Michael Siglain answered {{a series of questions}} regarding which characters fans wanted to see in the series. Question No.19 asked [...] "We were told Anarky would be playing a part in 52. Could you please tell us when we can expect his appearances?" [...] Siglain's simple response to readers was, [...] "check <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 40s." [...] Speculation centered on the prospect of Anarky appearing in issue No.48 of the series, as the solicited cover illustration was released to the public several weeks before the issues' publication. [...] On the cover, the circle-A could be seen as a minor element in the background. In a review for [...] "Week 48", Major Spoilers considered the absence of Anarky a drawback: [...] "It's too bad we didn't see the return of Anarky as hinted by this week's cover" [...] Pop culture critic, Douglas Wolk, wrote, [...] "I guess this issue's cover is the closest we're going to get to Anarky after all (and by proxy as close as we're {{going to get to the}} Haunted Tank).

Heriot told the Senate Committee on the Judiciary: [...] "If the value of a federal agency could be {{calculated}} on a per dollar basis, it would not surprise me to find the Commission on Civil Rights to be among the best investments Congress ever made. My back-of-the-envelope calculation is that the Commission now accounts for less than 1/2000th of 1 percent of the federal budget; <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> 1950s its size would have been roughly similar.

2500|$|One of the province's {{most popular}} attractions {{is a group}} of ten totem poles at Brockton Point.

[...] More totem poles were purchased in the 1920s and 1930s, this time originating from the Queen Charlotte Islands and Rivers Inlet. All of the totem poles were moved to Brockton Point in 1962 to allow the construction of an overhead road at Lumberman's Arch. Many of them have been replaced with replicas, with the originals now kept in museums for preservation.

2500|$|Allegedly, Nichita Smochină found {{understanding}} from Romania's {{new national}} communist leader, Nicolae Ceaușescu. He claimed that, in 1965, Ceaușescu {{asked him to}} retrieve those documents which showed Antonescu's move to a separate peace; driven by a Securitate guard to Caransebeș, where he had allegedly buried the evidence <b>back</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> '40s, Smochină only recovered three empty crates. Ceaușescu allowed him to receive a new pension, but he was denied reintegration into the Academy, with the suggestion that {{such a move would}} dampen Romania–Russia relations. These were openly tested by the Bessarabian community in February 1967, when Halippa presented Ceaușescu's Council of State with reports on the existence of oppressed Soviet Romanians. These included a polemical note by Smochină, who condemned the Soviet-endorsed delimitation of a [...] "Moldovan people" [...] in Bessarabia, and in general the ideology of [...] "Moldovenism". A month later, Halippa advanced Smochină's name among those of Bessarabians who could serve as specialists for the Romanian Communist Party's ISISP foundation of social science.|$|E
