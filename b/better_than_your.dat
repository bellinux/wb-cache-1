500|$|Keeping {{with the}} custom at the time, Hancock did not {{campaign}} personally, but stayed at his post at Fort Columbus on Governors Island, in New York Harbor {{and met with}} visitors there (as General Grant had in 1868, Hancock remained on active duty throughout the campaign). Both parties' campaigns began {{with a focus on}} the candidates rather than the issues. Democratic newspapers attacked the Republican nominee, James A. Garfield of Ohio, over rumors of corruption and self-dealing in the Crédit Mobilier affair, among others. Republicans characterized Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character. Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Hancock biographer David M. Jordan later characterized their message as simply [...] "our man is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> man".|$|E
500|$|The game's {{graphics}} and sounds were {{also met with}} muted enthusiasm. Kasavin complained of Deus Exs relatively sub-par graphics, blaming them on the game's [...] "incessantly dark industrial environments." [...] GamePro reviewer Chris Patterson {{took the time to}} note that despite being [...] "solid acoustically," [...] Deus Ex had moments of weakness. He poked fun at JC's [...] "Joe Friday, 'just the facts, deadpan," [...] and the [...] "truly cheesy accents" [...] of minor characters in Hong Kong and New York City. IGN called the graphics [...] "blocky", adding that [...] "the animation is stiff, and the dithering is just plain awful in some spots," [...] referring to the limited capabilities of the Unreal Engine used to design the game. the website, later on, stated that [...] "overall Deus Ex certainly looks <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> average game." ...|$|E

Reel Big Fish released a video clip for [...] "Take On Me", directed by Jeff Moore, and features the band playing the song while walking down an aisle in the stadium, and playing a game of BASEketball interlaced with clips from the film.

500|$|The Democrats, {{for their}} part, campaigned on the {{character}} of the candidates. They attacked Garfield for his connection with the Crédit Mobilier of America scandal of the early 1870s, in which many members of Congress were bribed by the Crédit Mobilier corporation, a railroad construction company. Garfield's precise involvement was unknown, but modern biographers agree that his account of his dealings with the construction syndicate were less than perfectly honest. Democrats used the incident as a contrast with Hancock who, as a career army officer, stood apart from Congress and lobbyists. Many in the Republican Party were reluctant to directly criticize the [...] "hero of Gettysburg", but they did characterize Hancock as uninformed on the issues, and some of his former comrades-in-arms gave critical speeches regarding his character. Democrats never made clear what about their victory would improve the nation; Jordan later characterized their message as simply [...] "our man is <b>better</b> <b>than</b> <b>your</b> man".|$|E
