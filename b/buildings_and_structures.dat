40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} listed <b>buildings,</b> objects <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> in Nigeria. A study of listed <b>buildings,</b> objects <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> was undertaken to examine their number and condition. The paper discussed the importance of listed buildings to the environment in terms of architectural, historic and cultural significance. It examined the location, criteria and level of preservation and maintenance of such <b>buildings,</b> objects <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> in Nigeria. The study further looked at the origin of listing, listing in Britain {{and other parts of}} the world. Listing across the six geo-political zones of Nigeria was also undertaken through direct observation and review of collated data from relevant agencies in charge of listing of buildings in Nigeria. The research made some recommendations that will assist in the preservation of Nigeria`s cultural heritage and sense of identity. The study concludes that the regulatory body which is the National Commission for Museum and Monuments should take the opportunity of securing <b>and</b> preserving these <b>buildings,</b> objects <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> for the benefits of the wider generation to experience the <b>buildings,</b> objects <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> that have been declared as National figures in Nigeria...|$|R

5|$|The town {{began to}} develop after the {{completion}} of the Okanogan Irrigation Project, which was designed to facilitate farming. At this time, many farmers came to Omak looking for homes. Fruits including apples, berries, peaches, plums and watermelons were cultivated after 1910. Omak served as a census-designated place (CDP) in 1910, and incorporated as a city on February 11, 1911. Omak and Okanogan have shared a rivalry in high school sports. During the Great Depression of 1933, several residents of Omak were forced to work in nearby communities. As a result, the United States Bureau of Reclamation promoted work which was available as part of an improvement project at Grand Coulee Dam in nearby Coulee Dam, which employed approximately 5,000 people between 1933 and 1951 when the megaproject ended. By 1950, the city was home to various <b>buildings</b> <b>and</b> <b>structures</b> including the St. Mary Mission church, which satisfied residential needs.|$|E
