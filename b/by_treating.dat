40|$|Objectives: To {{evaluate}} a {{decision support system}} (TREAT) for guidance of empirical antimicrobial therapy in an environment with a low prevalence of resistant pathogens. Methods: A retrospective trial of TREAT has been performed at Copenhagen University, Hvidovre Hospital. The cohort of patients included adults with systemic inflammation and suspicion of commu-nity-acquired bacterial infection. The empirical antimicrobial treatment recommended <b>by</b> <b>TREAT</b> was compared with the empirical antimicrobial treatment prescribed by the first attending clinical physician. Results: Out of 171 patients recruited, 161 (65 with microbiologically documented infections) fulfilled the inclusion criteria of <b>TREAT.</b> Coverage achieved <b>by</b> <b>TREAT</b> {{was significantly higher than}} that by clinical practice (86 % versus 66 %, P 5 0. 007). There {{was no significant difference in}} the cost of future resistance between treatments chosen <b>by</b> <b>TREAT</b> and those <b>by</b> physicians. The direct expenses for antimicrobials were higher in TREAT when including patients without antimicrobial treatment, while there was no significant difference otherwise. The cost of side effects was significantly lower using TREAT. Conclusions: The results of the study suggest that TREAT can improve the appropriateness of antimicro-bial therapy and reduce the cost of side effects in regions with a low prevalence of resistant pathogens, however, at the expense of increased use of antibiotics...|$|R

Photons seem well-suited to be elements of an extremely fast quantum computer, and the quantum entanglement of photons is a focus of research.

However, such processes generally do not require the assumption of photons per se; they may often be modeled <b>by</b> <b>treating</b> atoms as nonlinear oscillators. The nonlinear process of spontaneous parametric down conversion is often used to produce single-photon states. Finally, photons are essential in some aspects of optical communication, especially for quantum cryptography.|$|E
40|$|Cyclophosphamide is an {{alkylating agent}} which has {{deleterious}} {{effects on reproduction}} in both males and females. When administered to male rats in chronic low doses (6 mg/kg/day), cyclophosphamide caused a dose-dependent increase in post-implantation death of the offspring. On day 7 of gestation, two days after implantation, the inner cell mass-derived embryonic tissues were retarded or absent while trophectoderm-derived extraembryonic tissues appeared normal. The preimplantation growth of embryos sired by cyclophosphamide-treated males was affected; as early as day 3 {{there was a significant}} decrease in cell number and in DNA synthesis. On day 3, there was no ultrastructural evidence of active cell death, and embryos underwent compaction, despite their decreased cell numbers. On day 4, embryos sired <b>by</b> <b>treated</b> males had less than half the cell number of controls: this decrease was not lineage-specific. A minority of embryos sired <b>by</b> <b>treated</b> males did not cavitate and showed signs of autophagic death on day 4 of gestation. The majority of embryos sired <b>by</b> <b>treated</b> males were able to cavitate and differentiate morphologically to form small blastocysts. Thus the target of cyclophosphamide damage may be a paternal gene more important for cell proliferation than for cell differentiation in the preimplantation rat embryo...|$|R

5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded <b>by</b> <b>treating</b> the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had done wrong. Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E
5|$|Most {{synthesis}} routines yield {{a mixture}} of different actinide isotopes as oxides, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. MOX fuel) in nitric acid, and remove {{the bulk of the}} uranium and plutonium using a PUREX (Plutonium – URanium EXtraction) type extraction with tributyl phosphate in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue (raffinate) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, {{a mixture of}} trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step chromatographic and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent. Bis-triazinyl bipyridine complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium. Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved <b>by</b> <b>treating</b> a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous sodium bicarbonate with ozone at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.|$|E

Helium was also isolated by the American geochemist William Francis Hillebrand prior to Ramsay's discovery when he noticed unusual spectral lines while testing a sample of the mineral uraninite. Hillebrand, however, attributed the lines to nitrogen. His letter of congratulations to Ramsay offers an interesting case of discovery and near-discovery in science.|$|E
5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed <b>by</b> <b>treating</b> it with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E
5|$|Synthesis of c-BN uses same methods {{as that of}} diamond: Cubic {{boron nitride}} is {{produced}} <b>by</b> <b>treating</b> hexagonal boron nitride at high pressure and temperature, much as synthetic diamond is produced from graphite. Direct conversion of hexagonal boron nitride to the cubic form has been observed at pressures between 5 and 18GPa and temperatures between 1730 and 3230°C, that is similar parameters as for direct graphite-diamond conversion. The addition of {{a small amount of}} boron oxide can lower the required pressure to 4–7GPa and temperature to 1500°C. As in diamond synthesis, to further reduce the conversion pressures and temperatures, a catalyst is added, such as lithium, potassium, or magnesium, their nitrides, their fluoronitrides, water with ammonium compounds, or hydrazine. Other industrial synthesis methods, again borrowed from diamond growth, use crystal growth in a temperature gradient, or explosive shock wave. The shock wave method is used to produce material called heterodiamond, a superhard compound of boron, carbon, and nitrogen.|$|E
