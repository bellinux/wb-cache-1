5|$|College {{students}} {{are at risk}} of engaging in poor sleep hygiene and also of being unaware of the resulting effects of sleep deprivation. Because of irregular weekly schedules and the campus environment, college students may <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to have variable sleep-wake schedules across the week, take naps, drink caffeine or alcohol near bedtime, and sleep in disruptive sleeping environments. Because of this, {{it is important to have}} sleep hygiene education on college campuses.|$|E

5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and that since 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, {{the decision was made to}} raise an all volunteer force, the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF), to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland from possible attack and to improve Australia's overall level of readiness through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the conclave, Alessandro Farnese, the cardinal-nephew of Paul III, and his faction of four or five {{cardinals}} (including Ranuccio Farnese and Guido Ascanio Sforza), whom Guise had counted among the French faction, began supporting the second choice of the Holy Roman Emperor, Reginald Pole, apparently having received assurances that Ottavio Farnese's claim to the Duchy of Parma would be supported by Charles V. On December 5, Pole received twenty-six votes, only two short of the requisite two-thirds majority, prompting French ambassador Claude d'Urfé to rush {{to the door of the}} conclave, demanding that the conclave wait for the French cardinals, whom he claimed were in Corsica, and threatening that the election of a pope in their absence would <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to cause a schism.|$|E
5|$|Buffon {{transferred}} from Parma to Juventus on 3 July 2001 for €52million, along with former Parma teammate Lilian Thuram, and was handed the number 1 shirt {{as the starting}} goalkeeper, replacing Edwin van der Sar, who was sold to Fulham. Buffon later said {{that there had been}} an initial possibility for him to join Roma, but they signed Ivan Pelizzoli instead, and although negotiations were ongoing with Barcelona, he chose Juventus because his father convinced him he would <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to achieve his ambition of winning the Scudetto. This transfer fee made Buffon Juventus's most expensive purchase ever, a record which was only broken in 2016 by the acquisition of Gonzalo Higuaín.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{symptoms}} of low mood and energy, individuals with depression may <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to have {{behaviors that are}} counter to good sleep hygiene, such as taking naps during the day, consuming alcohol near bedtime, and consuming large amounts of caffeine during the day. In addition to sleep hygiene education, bright light therapy can be a useful treatment for individuals with depression. Not only can morning bright light therapy help establish a better sleep-wake schedule, {{but it also has}} been shown to be effective for treating depression directly, especially when related to seasonal affective disorder.|$|E

5|$|In 1803, {{war with}} France {{appeared}} imminent once again. After some discussions, {{it was agreed}} to adapt the 16th-century keep to enable it to hold six 24-pounder (10.8kg) guns; the roof was vaulted and a central stone pillar was installed to run up through the building, work estimated {{at the time to}} <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to cost £4,122. The historian Andrew Saunders likens the resulting building to the various Martello towers being constructed along the south coast at this time. It was proposed to build two temporary gun batteries to replace the 1795 emplacements, which had suffered from the salt air and decayed, but the plan was turned down in order to focus attention on the redevelopment of the keep. The work was carried out by a mixture of soldiers and civilian contractors and was completed by the end of 1806.|$|E
5|$|Michigan {{participated in}} the 2013 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament at the United Center in Chicago. As the #5 seed, they {{defeated}} Penn State in the opening round on March 14 by an 83–66 margin. In the second round, the team lost to Wisconsin, 68–59. Prior to the 2013 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament, Jeff Goodman of CBSSports.com named Michigan first among tournament teams in terms of having the most future NBA talent on its roster (in the absence of Kentucky, which was left to accept {{an invitation to the}} 2013 National Invitation Tournament). Among Michigan's starting lineup, Burke, Robinson, Hardaway, and McGary were all expected to <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> NBA Draft choices, while Stauskas had the potential to be one.|$|E
5|$|Samaras {{suffered}} a knee cartilage injury in mid-October, after a successful operation {{he was expected}} to be out for a month. This meant he would <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to miss crucial Champions League ties against Manchester United and Aalborg. He returned earlier than expected and was back in training on 9 November, having missed seven games. Samaras returned to action on 12 November, coming on as a substitute in a 3–0 win over Kilmarnock. On 25 November he started against Aalborg but did not play well and missed several chances as Celtic lost 2–1. This loss consigned Celtic to a bottom place finish in their group.|$|E

5|$|The {{confirmation}} of extraterrestrial intelligence {{could have a}} profound impact on religious doctrines, potentially causing theologians to reinterpret scriptures to accommodate the new discoveries. However, a survey of people with many different religious beliefs indicated that their faith would not be affected by the discovery of extraterrestrial intelligence, and another study, conducted by Ted Peters of the Pacific Lutheran Theological Seminary, shows that most people would not consider their religious beliefs superseded by it. Surveys of religious leaders indicate that only a small percentage are concerned that the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence might fundamentally contradict the views of the adherents of their religion. Gabriel Funes, the chief astronomer of the Vatican Observatory and a papal adviser on science, has stated that the Catholic Church would <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to welcome extraterrestrial visitors warmly.|$|E
5|$|The invitations were {{distributed}} among 450leading citizens and {{officials in the}} capital. The Cabildo compiled the guest list, and tried to guarantee the result, inviting people that would <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to support the Viceroy. The revolutionaries countered this move with a similar one, so {{that most people would}} be against Cisneros instead. The printer Agustín Donado, supporting the revolutionaries, printed nearly 600invitations instead of the 450requested, and distributed the surplus among the criollos. During the night, Castelli, Rodríguez, French and Beruti visited all the barracks to harangue the troops and prepare them for the following day.|$|E
5|$|This concern {{led to an}} {{independent}} review of the project by the Committee on Civil Scientific Research and Development, which met on topic between July and September 1962. The Committee ultimately rejected the economic arguments, including considerations of supporting the industry made by Thorneycroft. Their report in October stated that it was unlikely there would be any direct positive economic outcome, but that the project should still be considered {{for the simple reason}} that everyone else was going supersonic, and they were concerned they would be locked out of future markets. Conversely, it appeared the project would not <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to significantly impact other, more important, research efforts.|$|E

Although, the FVCs possess high opportunity recognition potential with respect to high-tech domains, they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to possess lower depth of local networks that guard them against information asymmetry risks (Wright et al., 2005). On the contrary although the DVCs <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to possess {{better understanding of the}} socio-cultural-institutional context, traditionally high-tech investing has not been their forte.

30|$|Assuming {{traditional}} gender roles, it thus {{follows that}} the combined effect of CLM and education will differ {{for men and}} women. More generally, Predictions 2 and 3 regarding education depend on whether {{men and women are}} predominantly WiHo workers or employers of WiHo. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> on the employer side, the more the combined effect of education and CLM on couple formation <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> negative. The more they <b>are</b> <b>likely</b> to <b>be</b> WiHo workers, the less CLM <b>is</b> <b>likely</b> to affect couple formation of the college-educated.|$|R
5|$|Until 2015 {{all known}} {{mammalian}} prion diseases {{were considered to}} be caused by the prion protein, PrP; in 2015 Multiple System Atrophy was found to <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> caused by a new prion, the misfolded form of a protein called alpha-synuclein. The endogenous, properly folded form of the prion protein is denoted PrPC (for Common or Cellular), whereas the disease-linked, misfolded form is denoted PrPSc (for Scrapie), after one of the diseases first linked to prions and neurodegeneration.) The precise structure of the prion is not known, though they can be formed by combining PrPC, polyadenylic acid, and lipids in a protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA) reaction. Proteins showing prion-type behavior are also found in some fungi, which has been useful in helping to understand mammalian prions. Fungal prions do not appear to cause disease in their hosts.|$|E
5|$|Washington v.

Jackie Washington had attempted to call his co-defendant as a witness, but was blocked by Texas courts because state law prevented co-defendants from testifying for each other, under the theory that they would <b>be</b> <b>likely</b> to lie for each other on the stand.|$|E
5|$|With {{global warming}} causing glaciers and {{permafrost}} to melt rapidly and allowing {{a large amount}} of fresh water to flow into the oceans, there are concerns that if the amount of fresh water in the oceans reaches a critical point, there will be a disruption in the thermohaline circulation.
