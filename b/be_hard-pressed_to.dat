5|$|The New Yorker {{film critic}} Anthony Lane {{reflected}} on the sketch and Belushi's performance in 2013. Lane thought that the sketch was an effective satire of the cancellation of the series and simultaneously served as a death knell for the Star Trek franchise. He felt that viewers watching the sketch in 1976 would <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> imagine a future, thirty-seven-years later, where Star Trek was so thoroughly ensconced within popular culture. Lane wrote that Belushi was flawless in his role parodying Shatner playing Kirk. He observed that Belushi both performed an effective parody, while simultaneously injecting his own weariness into the Kirk character. Lane wondered how the Star Trek franchise could ever {{come back from the}} total deconstruction the SNL skit presented.|$|E

500|$|Gasol is very {{athletic}} and quick for a 7-footer (213cm), {{allowing him to}} play both the power forward and center positions, much like fellow European players Toni Kukoč and Dirk Nowitzki. He is a refined scorer in the post and midrange; his overall game is near-ambidextrous and {{makes it difficult for}} opposing teams to defend. Gasol uses a variety of midrange jumpers, hook shots, up-and-under moves, and shot fakes to score very efficiently. In addition, his foot speed relative to his size allows him to run the fast break and finish effectively. He is also a skilled passer for a big man, earning 3.2 assists per game over his career. Defensively, he is an above-average shot blocker with a career average of 1.7 blocks per game. Former Lakers teammate Kobe Bryant said of Gasol, [...] "You'd <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> find a big [...] with his skill set {{in the history of the}} game." ...|$|E

Kevin Apaza, writing for Direct Lyrics labelled the single [...] "fresh and funky", confessing that he likes it better than its predecessors [...] "1.000.000" [...] (2012) and [...] "Get Back (ASAP)" [...] (2011). Furthermore, Apaza foreseed [...] "Lemonade" [...] as a club hit with the help of [...] "a few killer remixes".

500|$|GamesTM said [...] "It's one {{of those}} mixed-bag {{situations}} – flashes of genius and genuinely enjoyable moments of success, occasionally mired by unbalanced weapon damage, clumsy AI and the odd bit of unfair level design that requires astounding feats of memory". Eurogamer called XIII [...] "a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking {{from most of the}} factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as [...] "about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, [...] "You'd <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> find a more visually stunning game than XIII", but complained that [...] "numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its [...] "style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [...] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane"; he concluded, [...] "But if {{all you need is a}} solid shooter fix, XIII will do just fine.

Babish applauded {{the lack of an}} arching plot, allowing [...] "Michael's faux pas" [...] to take center stage. Michael Sciannamea of AOLTV called [...] "Take Your Daughter to Work Day" [...] the [...] "best episode yet this season" [...] and noted that [...] "the writers will <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> {{come up with a better}} story than this one." [...] Sciannamea called [...] "the transformation of Michael's indifference over the kids to one of acceptance and pure enjoyment of having them around" [...] as the [...] "most interesting aspect of the episode".

500|$|Thor Christensen of The Dallas Morning News {{reported}} Jackson often lip syncs in concert; he wrote: [...] "Janet Jackson—one of pop's {{most notorious}} onstage lip-syncers—conceded... she uses 'some' taped vocals to augment her live vocals. But {{she refused to}} say what percentage of her concert 'voice' is taped {{and how much is}} live." [...] Michael MacCambridge of the Austin American-Statesman, who reviewed Jackson's Rhythm Nation World Tour, described lip-syncing as a [...] "moot point", stating [...] "Jackson was frequently singing along with her own pre-recorded vocals, to achieve a sound closer to radio versions of singles." [...] MacCambridge also observed [...] "it seemed unlikely that anyone—even a prized member of the First Family of Soul Music—could dance like she did for 90 minutes and still provide the sort of powerful vocals that the '90s super concerts are expected to achieve." [...] Similarly, Chris Willman commented, [...] "even a classically trained vocalist would <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> maintain any sort of level of volume—or, more appropriately, 'Control'—while bounding up and down stairs and whipping limbs in unnatural directions at impeccable, breakneck speed." [...] Critics observed that in the smaller scale of her [...] "Number Ones: Up Close and Personal" [...] tour, she forewent lip-syncing. Chris Richards of The Washington Post stated [...] "even at its breathiest, that delicate voice hasn't lost the laserlike precision." ...|$|E

500|$|Evans was {{promoted}} to group captain in January 1969 and appointed Director of Air Force Plans. In this position he proposed and organised the gift of 23 of the RAAF's old CAC Sabres to the Indonesian Air Force, following an earlier presentation of 10Sabres to the Royal Malaysian Air Force. He completed studies at the Royal College of Defence Studies, London, in 1972. [...] Returning to Australia, he {{was promoted}} to air commodore and appointed Director-General Plans and Policy, Air Force, in January 1973. He served as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Amberley from February 1975 until April 1977. In this role he qualified as a pilot on the recently delivered F-111C swing-wing bomber, as well as the UH-1 Iroquois helicopter. Following his tour as Amberley base commander, Evans {{was promoted to}} air vice marshal and became Chief of Air Force Operations (CAFOPS). He held this newly created position for the next two years, broken by a temporary posting as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff between January and August 1978. As CAFOPS, Evans played a major part in developing the RAAF's plans for the defence of Australia. Following America's announcement in the 1969 Guam Doctrine that its allies would have to assume greater self-reliance in their military affairs, Australia's strategic thought underwent a change from its earlier policy of [...] "forward defence" [...] to a more localised defensive posture. While the consensus among RAAF planning staff was to adopt a [...] "repulsion" [...] concept of attacking an enemy force along the air and sea approaches to northern Australia, Evans considered that this did not go far enough in exploiting the long-range offensive capabilities of such aircraft as the F-111. Convinced that Australia's numerically small forces would <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> dislodge an invader that had gained a foothold on the continent, he refined the [...] "repulsion" [...] stance into what he termed an [...] "anti-lodgement" [...] strategy, focussing on defeating the enemy at its potential staging bases north of Australia and then, as a last resort, on the approaches closer to home. The Air Force's role in shaping an overall strategy that took advantage of the [...] "air-sea gap" [...] was later acknowledged in the Federal government paper The Defence of Australia 1987. Evans was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 26January 1981 for his achievements as CAFOPS.|$|E

Contrary to their expectations of retaking Salona, the citizens <b>were</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> maintain themselves even in the Palace. Upon hearing of their return, the Croats destroyed their crops and confined them within the gates.

They also allegedly had an on-air spat with long-time hockey writer and broadcaster Stan Fischler, who never did another interview on their show. In 2006, Jaromir Jagr jokingly made fun of their hockey knowledge, to which the duo said that he had sold them on watching more.|$|E
2500|$|Callum Marsh of Slant Magazine {{gave the}} film 1 star, and wrote: [...] "Flaws—and {{there are a}} great many that would have never made the cut were this a perfectible studio recording—are {{conveniently}} swept under the rug of candid expression ... the worst quality of Les Misérables's live singing is simply that it puts too much pressure on a handful of performers who frankly cannot sing.... Fisheye lenses and poorly framed close-ups abound in Les Misérables, nearly every frame a revelation of one man's bad taste ... One would <b>be</b> <b>hard-pressed</b> <b>to</b> describe this, despite the wealth of beauty on display, as anything but an ugly film, shot and cut ineptly. Everything in the film, songs included, is cranked to 11, the melodrama of it all soaring. So it's odd that this kind of showboating maximalism should be ultimately reduced to a few fisheye'd faces, mugging for their close-up, as the people sing off-key and broken." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Michael Philips gave the film only one and a half stars, writing: [...] "The camera bobs and weaves like a drunk, frantically. So you have hammering close-ups, combined with woozy insecurity each time more than two people are in the frame. ...too little in this frenzied mess of a film registers because Hooper is trying to make everything register at the same nutty pitch." ...|$|E

Days of Our Lives was renewed in 2008, but the budget was slashed severely by 40%.

[...] David Amidon of PopMatters said, [...] "Unlike his previous efforts Oxymoron picks a brand of momentum and sticks to it, avoiding the peaks and surprises that have so often signified a ScHoolboy Q project. But once the songs open up, once the mind begins latching onto whatever phrases happen to stand out from track to track alongside the larger personal narrative and getting lost in the blunted haze provided by Mike Will, Sounwave, Alchemist and Nez & Rio among others, it's hard to remain as aloof as initial impressions might feel." [...] Omar Burgess of HipHopDX stated, [...] "Ultimately the good moments are on par with what will be considered 2014's high-water marks, and if held they weren't held to the high standards of Setbacks and Habits & Contradictions, Q's low points would be acceptable from another rapper. Given TDE's ever-increasing appeal, Oxymoron isn't quite an elite offering, but it meets {{the difficult task of}} attracting casual fans without straying too far from the formula that attracted ScHoolboy Q's core audience." [...] David Jeffries of AllMusic said, [...] "The wonders never cease on this adventurous and street-tough effort, but they never sort themselves well, either, and with accessible highlights like [...] "Blind Threats," [...] "Break the Bank," [...] and [...] "Man of the Year" [...] all bundled toward the end, this LP requires a surprising amount of patience, especially for an album with [...] "featuring 2 Chainz" [...] on its track list." ...|$|E
