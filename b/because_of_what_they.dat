5|$|Days {{after the}} 2011 {{parliamentary}} elections in early December 2011, {{it was suggested}} by Vesna Pusić– already recognized as the future Minister of Foreign and European Affairs– that the referendum should be postponed until March 2012 to allow better preparation for the poll. The suggestion was soon followed by a similar request made by GONG that the referendum be postponed until mid-February or later; its request was also supported by five major trade unions. GONG's request was made <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> stated to be: poor information provided to citizens; undefined procedures for voter registration away from a voter's permanent residence; unclear directions for voting abroad; no legal provisions specifically defining the composition of ballot counting commissions; no provisions for referendum vote monitoring by partisan, non-partisan and foreign monitors; no legal provisions regarding referendum funding (since the 2011 state budget did not appropriate any funds to cover referendum expenses); no legal provisions funding the pro-referendum campaign or allowing the campaign itself; {{and the lack of}} restrictions against campaigning {{on the day of the}} referendum. The union support for this request was due to the government's ultimately not putting forward the other referendum (altering the conditions for referendums from citizens by changing the number of petitioners required and the time allowed to gather their signatures), which they had earlier agreed to do. Another request to postpone the election was made by more than a thousand signatories of a petition to the government, demanding that the referendum be postponed until after the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) returned the final verdict in the case against generals Ante Gotovina and Mladen Markač. They cited concerns over EU support for the ICTY, which they describe as biased; they therefore questioned if the EU favoured some nations over others.|$|E

30|$|The {{result of}} this {{immigration}} pattern is that many German immigrants are {{and continue to be}} temporary. Temporary migrants may differ from permanent migrants in many predictable ways. First, they may be expected to save more and remit more of their income. For example, Bauer and Sinning (2011) find that permanent migrants in Germany save less that native Germans. This might be <b>because</b> part <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> would save is invested in acquiring human capital that aids in assimilation such as learning German. Temporary migrants, however, make much less of this type of investment. The study finds that their savings were similar to that of natives and, hence, higher than permanent migrants.

5|$|The lay {{attendees}} at Tinh Xa Trung Tam {{are predominantly}} female by {{a ratio of}} around 5 to 1, {{and most of the}} temple-goers are over 40. Most of the younger lay disciples are relatives of regular, older attendees. In addition to local residents, who make up the bulk of the disciples, some are from other parts of Vietnam, as well as overseas Vietnamese who are temporarily in the country. According to the American professor of Vietnamese history and religion Mark W. McLeod, who did fieldwork at Tịnh Xá Trung Tâm, he did not survey the laypeople about their income, for fear of embarrassing them, but conjectured that most had an above average income as they were able to devote a considerable amount of time to organized religious activity instead of working longer hours. A regular occurrence at the temple is the weekly Bát Quan Trai Giới (Eight Precepts Ritual). As part of this, the participants take on three additional vows apart from the Five Precepts and stay at the temple for a 24-hour period. These vows prohibit adornments such as makeup and jewellery, the use of comfortable beds and chairs, and eating impurely. During the retreat day, meals are taken in silence and talking is avoided, apart from during dharma talks, sutra chanting and religious debate. Meditation is also a part of the routine. Tinh Xa Trung Tam holds the Eight Precepts Ritual more often than any other institution in the city; the next most frequent temple holds the retreat once every two weeks. Dharma talks are held weekly by the resident monks and nuns, which is generally more frequent than at other places in the city. The disciples and monks at the temple told McLeod that they chose Tinh Xa Trung Tam <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> regarded as a higher level of discipline, rigor and scholarship at the institution. The monks are transported by their disciples as they are forbidden to drive.|$|E

50|$|A lot of {{language}} development that happens {{during this time}} period {{takes place in a}} school setting. During {{the beginning of the school}} age years, children’s vocabulary expands through increases in reading. Increased exposure to reading also helps school-aged children learn more difficult grammatical forms, including plurals and pronouns. These changes improve their communication skills <b>because</b> the message <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> are trying to say will become clearer. They also begin to develop metalinguistic awareness which allows them to reflect and more clearly understand the language they use. This ability helps them understand jokes and riddles because they can comprehend the differences in the words. Having the skills to read well is a gateway for learning new vernacular at a young age and having the confidence in complex word choices while talking with adults. This is an important developmental part socially and physiologically for the child. School-aged children can easily be influenced through communication and gestures. As children continue to learn communication, they realize the difference between forms of intentions and that there are numerous different ways to express the same intent, with different meaning. This new form of message complexity shows growth in a child's interpersonal communication and how they interpret language of others.|$|R

60|$|In {{what shape}} the benefit accrues {{to the two}} nations from the trade, is clear enough. Germany, before the {{commencement}} of the trade, paid six shillings per yard for broad-cloth. She now obtains it at a lower price. This, however, is not the whole of her advantage. As the money prices of all her other commodities have risen, the money incomes of all her producers have increased. This is no advantage to them in buying from each other; <b>because</b> the price <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> buy has risen in the same ratio with their means of paying for it: {{but it is an}} advantage to them in buying any thing which has not risen; and still more, any thing which has fallen. They therefore benefit as consumers of cloth, not merely {{to the extent to which}} cloth has fallen, but also to the extent to which other prices have risen. Suppose that this is one-tenth. The same proportion of their money incomes as before, will suffice to supply their other wants, and the remainder, being increased one-tenth in amount, will enable them to purchase one-tenth more cloth than before, even though cloth had not fallen. But it has fallen: so that they are doubly gainers. If they do not choose to increase their consumption of cloth, this does not prevent them from being gainers. They purchase the same quantity with less money, and have more to expend upon their other wants.|$|R
40|$|It is {{important}} to understand how growing up in a complex world that continues to socially construct race based on historical premises may be challenging for biracial Black/White Americans. This population of individuals is considered unique in that they represent the coming together of two historically polarized communities, a White superior group and a Black degenerate group. The presence of biracial individuals in America has historically shaped legislation on patronage, marriage, and racial classification. Their social identity has been and continues to be correlated with the state of interracial relations in this country. Throughout history, society has not been eager to understand and accommodate individuals who are mixed-race <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> and who <b>they</b> represent. The question and concern about the identity of mixed-race people was initially forged in the US during slavery when White, European slave owners began intermingling with their African slaves. The presence of Black/White biracial individuals who were difficult to discern from Whites threatened the proslavery arguments that Blacks were biologically inferior to Whites. In order to preserve the sanctity of the institution of slavery as well as protect White masters from having to provide patronage to their half-Black offspring, legislation was developed during the 1600 s to classify any Black/White biracial individual as Black. This became known as the principal of Hypo-descent or the premise that Black blood is considered a contaminate to pure white blood (&ldquo;one drop rule&rdquo;) (Brown, 2001; Graves, Jr., 2004).

I am also a weaver and member of the Rocky Mountain Weavers Guild (RMWG). In 2013 the RMWG received a donation from the Ford family in memory of their daughter, Janice Ford, who was an active RMWG member. RMWG approached me to do a natural dye workshop with the monies received –knowing Janice’s love of color. I instead suggested the money be used to start a dye garden. What an opportunity to bring a dream to a reality! With the guild’s approval, I met with Larry Vickerman (Director of the DBG Chatfield Farms) who loved the idea. The RMWG also committed to additional funding to complete the garden irrigation and fencing. Starting in the fall of 2013 a RMWG natural dye group was formed to start researching and selecting dye plants that were appropriate for our area. Some plants were chosen because they are well known, such as Marigolds, Coreopsis, Black-eyed Susan and Cosmos. Other plants, such as Madder and Indigo, were chosen <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> colors <b>they</b> produce. Still others, such as Weld and Dyer’s Broom, were picked <b>because</b> <b>of</b> their historic nature.

25|$|Women {{participating}} in polygynous marriages share common marital problems {{with women in}} a monogamous marriage; however, there are issues uniquely related to polygyny which affects their overall life satisfaction and have severe implications for women's health. Women practicing polygyny are susceptible to sexually transmitted diseases, infertility, and mental health complications. Among the Logoli of Kenya, the fear of AIDS or becoming infected with the HIV virus has informed women's decisions about entering polygynous marriages. Some view polygyny {{as a means to}} prevent men from taking random sexual partners and potentially introducing STDs into relationships. Interviews conducted with some of the Logoli tribe in Kenya suggested they feared polygynous marriages <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> have witnessed in the lives of other women who are currently in such relationships. The observed experiences of some of the women in polygynous unions tend to be characterized by frequent jealousy, conflicts, competition, tensions, and psychological stresses. Some of the husbands fail to share love and other resources equally; and envy and hatred, and sometimes violent physical confrontations become {{the order of the day}} among co-wives and their children. This discourages women from entering a polygynous marriage. Research shows that competition and conflict can intensify to unbearable level for co- wives causing women to commit suicide due to psychological distress. Findings show that the wife order can affect life satisfaction. According to Bove and Valeggia, women who are senior wives often misuse their position to obtain healthcare benefits in countries one wife can become a recipient. The conflict between co-wives can attribute to the higher rates of mental health disorders such as anxiety, depression, and paranoia.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{attention}} {{in the media and}} among students has renewed the relevance <b>of</b> the question <b>what</b> should be considered scientific, and what place science has in contemporary society. To get an overview of the theoretical framework, selections from philosophers of science Karl Popper, Thomas Kuhn, and Bruno Latour are reviewed to see <b>what</b> <b>they</b> consider essential to science. The expectation was to find three conflicting definitions, but instead it is concluded that these philosophers do not necessarily disagree with one another. They describe different aspects of the same concept, but focus on either science as method, as a philosophy and set of scientific values, or as descriptive politics. None of them are truly wrong, <b>because</b> all <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> describe is crucial to knowledge production as a whole. 	The third of the above-mentioned views, that of science as description, can be considered the most controversial. This thesis elaborates on it in the form of Robin Horton, who writes about religious theory and makes a comparison to science. He argues that both science and religion are about explanation, prediction, and control, and about creating deeper meaning by imposing patterns on unobservable phenomena. In addition, both represent a reflection of society while providing the cognitive tools to engage in that society, and operate on a ‘Theory Of’/’Theory For’ dynamic, which is responsive to pre-existing beliefs and needs. This critical reflection is meant to show how constitutive all of the sciences are to human civilization, democracy, and society. Despite impersonal ideals of the laboratory and the ivory tower, science is very strongly linked to the experience of reality and society: to who we think we are, to what the world is, and where we think we should be going. The main argument is therefore that all three elements of science, and the different modes and topics of research, should be investigated equally and understood within this distributed context. 	No single discipline is outside the politics of knowledge described in Horton and Latour: to deny certain disciplines their validity is equal to denying the corresponding parts in society. Inquiry into the nature of disciplines usually follow method, result or history. This standard needs to be revised by asking the right questions: a shift from only what a science is for, to also what it is about. This is important because, following Latour and Horton’s line of reasoning, a discipline itself is largely the product <b>of</b> <b>what</b> it studies. Secondly, it is suggested that one way to showcase and promote this vision of science - and to reinvigorate the human sciences in the process - is to teach accessible concept-based courses, which seek application in people’s lives and careers...|$|R

40|$|As the wage-market remains stagnant, {{and student}} {{indebtedness}} continues to rise, many graduates struggle {{to balance their}} student loan debt. Generally, when a debtor files for bankruptcy, her student loan debt is not dischargeable. However, under 11 U. S. C. § 523 (a) (8), debtors can discharge their student loans through bankruptcy if they can prove that maintaining those student loan debts would impose an 2 ̆ 2 undue hardship 2 ̆ 2 upon themselves. Unfortunately, Congress did not define what 2 ̆ 2 undue hardship 2 ̆ 2 meant when enacting the bankruptcy code. Courts have since been left to interpret the definition of 2 ̆ 2 undue hardship, 2 ̆ 2 and many do so in different ways. Across the various circuits, “undue hardship” is evaluated similarly—but the differences in definitions can sometimes be outcome determinative. While rare, a jurisdiction employing a “totality-of-the-circumstances” approach to undue hardship may discharge a debtor’s student loans when a different jurisdiction employing a more rigid test would not. This is a problem because the United States Constitution requires uniform federal bankruptcy laws to be applied throughout the states. This Comment calls for the legislature to further define undue hardship to avoid the rare circumstances when debtors are treated dissimilarly solely <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> court <b>they</b> appear in. Since {{there has been no}} further definition of “undue hardship,” {{it is important to understand}} how the student loan discharge process works within the states of Illinois, Indiana, and Wisconsin. The Seventh Circuit, after the recent holding in Tetzlaff v. Educational Credit Management Corp., now has one of the strictest tests for evaluating undue hardship. The unanimous Tetzlaff opinion reiterated that the Seventh Circuit employs a three-pronged test to determine whether undue hardship exists. The debtor must show that: (1) he cannot currently maintain a “minimal” standard of living for himself and his dependents if forced to repay the loans; (2) additional circumstances show that this state of affairs is likely to persist for a significant portion of the repayment period; and (3) he made a good faith effort to repay the loans in question. The Seventh Circuit clarified that the dischargeability of loans should be based on a certainty of hopelessness standard, not a present inability to fulfill a financial commitment. In light of that rationale, the second prong of the undue hardship analysis requires a debtor to show his “certainty of hopelessness. ” Further, the Seventh Circuit held that the third prong of the analysis—the good faith requirement—requires payment on the specific loans the debtor is attempting to discharge. Paying private student loans in lieu of paying federal loans does not allow debtors to discharge those federal loans. Ultimately, this Comment argues that this strict application of the “undue hardship” definition is more exacting than the language of “undue hardship” itself, and that the Seventh Circuit should reconsider its rigid application of the undue hardship analysis...|$|R

For instance, the indigenous Christian population of the Balkans, known as the [...] "rayah" [...] or the [...] "protected flock", was discriminated against under the Ottoman Kanun–i–Rayah. The word is sometimes translated as 'cattle' rather than 'flock' or 'subjects' in order to emphasize the Christian population's inferior status {{to that of the}} Muslim rayah.|$|E

These judgements, I suggest, {{are sensitive to}} an underlying metaphysical distinction. To see this, we {{need to pay attention}} to a relation that I call positive security-dependence, where an event E security-depends positively on an earlier event C just in case E could more easily have failed to occur if C had not occurred. I suggest that we judge that an event C is a cause of a later event E only if E security-depends positively on C. This explains our causal judgements in typical cases of hastening and delaying as well as in atypical cases, where we judge that hasteners are not causes <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> hasten or that delayers are causes <b>of</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> delay.
