Pharr, 706 / 542 - 5172, pharr@arches. uga. edu CONTACT: Prof. Ron Carlson, 706 / 542 - 5186 (O); (706) / 548 - 6771 (H) UGA LAW PROFESSOR URGES BUSH TEAM TO RETHINK STRATEGY ATHENS, Ga. - If Governor George <b>Bush</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> win the {{mounting}} public relations war over the protracted presidential election, he should rethink his strategy and drop his {{appeal to the}} U. S. Supreme Court, says Professor Ron Carlson, a nationally renowned trial law expert at the University of Georgia School of Law. 2 ̆ 2 It 2 ̆ 7 s within the purview - {{the discretion of the}} Bush team - to decide between now and Friday to let the case go, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 If they dismiss the appeal, they will gain in terms of the public perception that they are finally cutting off this process. The cost to the Bush side is the appearance of doing what they 2 ̆ 7 re accusing Gore of doing - that is, extending the process with legalisms. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson says Bush has little to gain by having his attorneys argue before the Supreme Court on Friday, because the court may very well hear the arguments and determine the issue raised is moot. 2 ̆ 2 I think the most likely scenario is that the Supreme Court will find the issue to be moot because the appealing party has no damages to claim, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Whatever adversity occurred to them {{as a result of the}} Florida Supreme Court decision has now been removed by this second certification. They did not lose in the end, at least in the view of the Florida officials that were responsible for the recount being reported. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson predicts that the spotlight will quickly shift from the U. S. Supreme Court - which has authorized an audio recording of Friday 2 ̆ 7 s oral arguments to be broadcast via radio on a tape delay, a move Carlson heralds as 2 ̆ 2 an extremely healthy and totally appropriate development 2 ̆ 2 - to the Florida trial courts, where Vice President Al Gore has announced he will contest election results in at least three counties. 2 ̆ 2 A contest is a trial in every sense of the word, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 I expect there will be opening statements, there will be direct and cross-examination of witnesses, there will be closing arguments, and then a decision by a judge. What we have here is an extended process at best. I expect these trials to be nationally televised, given the national interest in these issues, and I would expect it to be extended well beyond the deadline for certifying of electors. The public does not yet understand the lengthy process that a contest entails, but as the outlines become fully and starkly known, it will be a public relations disaster. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in trial practice, has litigated many cases and has been admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials.

40|$|APO North American correspondent, Joanna Mareth, {{watches the}} future {{president}} {{on the campaign trail}} Journeys with George, a behind-the-scenes documentary of life on the 2000 presidential campaign trail with George W. Bush, reveals only a few certainties. New Hampshire in January is very cold, Americans at political rallies with red, white, and blue-painted faces are scary, and nice guys, in this case, finish first. The film, which premiered here in the US last month, is the brainchild of Alexandra Pelosi, a 30 -year-old producer for NBC News who captured the year and a half she spent as part of Bush’s travelling press corps on her handheld Sony digital camera. Candidate Bush is hardly all-access, but Pelosi’s quirky reporting style is disarming and Bush {{spends a lot of time}} hamming it up for her camera. Though funny and occasionally insightful, Journeys with George does not answer the one question which has gripped America and the world since the Texas governor first announced his candidacy: Is Dubya smart enough to be president? Instead Pelosi’s film manages to reassure both Bush’s supporters and his detractors that they were right about him all along. It may be possible to catalogue the docu’s reviewers into “voted for him” and “didn’t” categories. See if you can guess: “The film’s chief hook is that George W. Bush turns out to be rather charming and quick-witted. ” “George W. Bush is a real idiot. You don’t need anything other than Journeys with George to prove it. ” The Bush we see is casual, self-assured, avuncular - ribbing Pelosi about her crush on a fellow member of the press corps, the Bush-dubbed “Newsweek Man” - and occasionally witty, in a roll-your-eyes kind of way: Pelosi: If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be? Bush: I’m not a tree, I’m a Bush. He’s even willing to mock his own malapropisms. “For those of you who were wondering what it was like to come up during the Cold War, we knew who the thems was and the thems was YOU,” he announces one night over the press plane PA system after a particularly-flubbed stump speech. But unscripted George turns steely after Pelosi asks him a question at a routine press conference about the record number of executions in Texas. How this is “hitting below the belt” (as he puts it) is never explained, but Pelosi quickly falls back into line. “This is what happens when you bite the man who feeds you,” she explains, noting that it’s her job to maintain her network’s friendly relationship with the candidate. Pelosi’s position as an objective journalist is perhaps complicated by her family legacy - her mother is a prominent Democratic congresswoman who campaigned for Gore in 2000. But she’s also swayed by the Bush charm offensive and clearly doesn’t like the chilly air at the back of the pack. From that point on, we’re treated to Bush modeling the latest Texas fashions, discussing his hand-shaking philosophy and ruminating on his diet (“I like a good bologna sandwich”). Politics is conspicuously absent. Pelosi’s soft touch gives the Bush candidacy an air of inevitability. Without issues to get in the way, the campaign looks more like a popularity contest, and Bush clearly excels at making friends. Thankfully, the genteel approach doesn’t always come easy for her. When <b>Bush</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> help fill in her primary ballot (to elect the nominee for each party), she expects him to earn her vote. “What will you do for the little guy?” she asks him. When he responds “I’m the little guy,” the look on her face reveals that she hasn’t completely succumbed to the reporter’s equivalent of the Stockholm syndrome. She votes for Bill Bradley. Still, Pelosi is more critical of campaign coverage in general and of her fellow press corps members, who all have to walk the same fine line between covering Bush and befriending him. The reporters, from competing news outlets, are ferried around on a worn-out airplane usually reserved for transporting criminals and fed the same institutional turkey sandwiches. Together they trudge through an endless series of identical speeches, 3 am political rallies, and staged photo-ops, a schedule which leaves them particularly ill-suited to distill the issues at stake for ordinary voters. “What are we doing here?” Pelosi asks more than once. Richard Wolffe, a correspondent with the Financial Times of London and the only foreign reporter in the pack, provides the right blend of detached observation and wry commentary. “This is the greatest story in the world. But in reality we spend a lot of time doing really stupid things with really stupid people. ” The close quarters breeds a wary sort of friendship, or “locationships” as she calls them. Pelosi’s buddies are quick to ditch her when they think her antics have cost them access to their candidate. In the end, Journeys with George may be Pelosi’s attempt to justify all the time she spent slogging after Bush. For him, all those long hours paid off. But, as she puts it, “We all got some good laughs at his expense, but in the end who are we? He’s the 43 rd President of the United States. ” Australian screenings of Journeys with George have not yet been scheduled The Journeys with George website is at www. journeyswithgeorge. co...|$|E

40|$|The G 8 meeting {{showed how}} hard heads and soft hearts {{can be a}} potent combination, writes Nicholas Gruen DOING good takes more than good intentions. You need to be tough-minded. That’s the idea {{embodied}} in the economists’ synthesis: ‘hard heads; soft hearts’. It’s such a powerful idea that if it’s forgotten we’re often forced to relearn it - often {{through the agency of}} the painful and uncertain political contest between left and right. At Gleneagles this synthesis worked on foreign aid. Because program failures undermine its support, a left-of-centre ‘cartel of good intentions’ has covered up the many failures of foreign aid. So we’ve been slow to discover and learn from what works and what doesn’t. We’ve even seen aid disappear into the Swiss bank accounts of third-world kleptocrats. It’s taken the political right to impose some hard-headedness. George Bush has sharply increased foreign aid whilst imposing much stronger conditions - for instance on cleaning up corruption - and Gleneagles extended this approach. That’s hard-headed soft-heartedness in action. But on the environment, Gleneagles gushed greenhouse gobbledygook. Leaders committed to ‘act with resolve and urgency’ - about as firmly as St Augustine prayed for virtue. ‘Lord make me chaste - but not yet’. Lord make me reduce my emissions - but not yet. We’re at a pretty pass. No one’s sure that the world will continue to warm or that our emissions of greenhouse gases are causing it. But scientists who deny it are now a rump consisting increasingly, though not entirely, of cranks. There’s plenty of uncertainty about the costs of global warming too - and that’s not counting the subjective value of unique eco-systems we could lose. But the costs of global warming could vastly outweigh the modest cost of even quite vigorous action. The Kyoto Protocol caps global emissions, but with two huge exceptions. First, the US has refused to ratify. (And thus emboldened, we’ve joined the US in our own exclusive duo - the coalition of the unwilling). Second, Kyoto exempts the developing countries - which produce nearly 40 percent of global emissions now, and will overtake the West within two decades. What are we doing about it? Next to nothing. International greenhouse politics remains mired in a swamp of soft-hearted soft-headedness. Being poorer, the developing countries are supposed to be the good guys. They’re also a majority of the UN and its progeny, the Kyoto Protocol. Thus the bizarre spectacle {{of a small group of}} rich countries taking on difficult commitments within an agreement formally controlled by those doing next to nothing. The majority remain serenely intransigent about taking on serious commitments while berating the minority for the paltriness of their sacrifice. They even call for compensation. Pointing to their own much lower carbon emissions per capita and the West’s relative wealth, they cry: ‘You created the problem, you fix it’. But if we were rationing water in a drought we’d want everyone to save water, though we might choose to compensate the poor. We should do the same with greenhouse. Actually, we already have. When Kyoto was negotiated, Russia was in the midst of a depression produced by its botched transition to capitalism. So the richer countries gave it a very generous entitlement to emit. Indeed Russia was permitted to emit more carbon than it was then emitting - so called ‘hot air’. Why? To reward it for signing up. Whether you call this ‘compensation’ or an ‘incentive’, (I call it a bribe) Russia now sells its excess emission entitlements to the highest bidder. Get it? In addition to compensating Russia, trading emissions permits makes Russia keen to cut its emissions further - so it can sell more permits. So it joins the global effort to reduce emissions. The West should offer developing countries a similarly generous deal. But breaking through their intransigence would also require a credible threat to impose trade sanctions if they kept stalling. But so far a hard headed, soft hearted offer like this isn’t even on the table. Why? Because the Europeans’ soft-heartedness is also soft-headed. They seem incapable of walking away from the table in the face of the developing country intransigence. American hard-headedness could be the antidote. But so far developing country intransigence has just been a fig leaf for the Americans’ refusal to ratify Kyoto. The real motive is hard-heartedness. George <b>Bush</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> protect the American ‘way of life’ from the costs of its existing emissions target. So he’s not about to accept an even smaller target, which he’d be forced to, if the developing countries were brought into Kyoto - like Russia, with a generous emissions entitlement. While I wait for progress out of this mess I’ll think of that puritan saying that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I 2 ̆ 7 ll be hoping that America’s walking away from Kyoto might just end up doing some good - that here on Earth the road to Heaven might be paved with a few bad intentions. Economists have been unable to sell their ‘hard heads, soft hearts’ recipe ready-made. But the contest between left and right might eventually deliver it. • Nicholas Gruen is Visiting Fellow at ANU and Melbourne University and CEO of Lateral Economics and Peach Discount Mortgage Broking.

40|$|Kevin Rudd’s {{proposed}} {{nuclear disarmament}} commission will encounter problems in Washington, writes ANDY BUTFOY NEWS that Prime Minister Kevin Rudd is establishing a Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament Commission is welcome. But the commission {{will have an}} uphill battle to make substantive progress outside the seminar room. There is the obvious problem of getting the usual suspects - such as Iran - into line. But a more politically awkward challenge for Rudd will be moving Washington in the right direction. The fact is that our most important ally, with which {{we have such a}} close relationship and with whom we supposedly have privileged and influential access, has for years ignored our policy and recommendations on some key non-proliferation goals. The most obvious example is Washington’s dismissive attitude to the Australian-sponsored nuclear weapons Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But the matter goes beyond the CTBT. To develop this point, take a report by senior Western analysts which earlier this year said the United States must be prepared to start a nuclear war. Many people were shocked by this, but not experienced analysts. After all, for decades Washington has declared a readiness to escalate crises into nuclear conflict and has helped kill efforts to ban first use. This approach goes back to when American plans for nuclear escalation were used to keep the Soviet Union from invading Western Europe. But the first-use option didn’t die {{with the end of the}} Cold War, it got repackaged. The Bush administration’s approach to Iran illustrates how this happened. Rather than simply contain Tehran, Washington has also dabbled with the oxymoronic idea of preventive war, and has contemplated using threats to help bring about political transformation of the country. As part of this muscling up, Washington refuses to rule out nuclear strikes. This has got the United States into a muddle. One day officials indicate Iran is a potential nuclear target. On other days, as in his last State of the Union Address, Bush says, “Our message to the people of Iran is clear: We have no quarrel with you. ” I doubt the message seems clear to many Iranians. It’s not that <b>Bush</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> press the button. But his advisors say he ought to show a readiness to do so. This supposedly enables Washington to leverage nuclear threats to boost its diplomacy. But using nuclear weapons to put the frighteners on Iran raises problems. For example, the tactic could encourage more Iranians to want their own deterrent. But there is more than Iranian sensitivities at issue. US nuclear threats also contradict the spirit of the Non-Proliferation Treaty. Most countries support the NPT on condition they won’t be threatened with devastation by the official members of the nuclear weapons club (the US, Russia, China, UK, France). Many efforts have been made to spell this out. For example, there was a 2006 proposal in the UN to develop legal measures “to assure non-nuclear-weapons states against the use or threat of use of nuclear weapons. ” Unfortunately, in the only negative vote from over 160 countries, the US said “no. ” This fits neoconservative instincts. They sometimes enjoy sharpening points of difference with the multilateral mainstream and believe a self evidently virtuous Washington shouldn’t be constrained by global rules. Unsurprisingly, this has exacerbated the difficulty of gaining consensus at NPT meetings and has accentuated perceptions of American double standards. Washington explains its stubbornness as being motivated by concerns over “weapons of mass destruction. ” WMD is a handy expression because it means that if you want to justify making a nuclear threat, but the opponent doesn’t have nuclear bombs, you can point to their biological and chemical weapons, or the usefully vague - and sometimes empty - idea of their “capabilities. ” This is despite the fact that many of these weapons, even when they do exist, are incapable of causing mass destruction. Furthermore, according to the Pentagon, the definition of WMD can be stretched even further to include, for example, high explosives. This means any state can be said to have WMD capabilities. The WMD label is loaded rhetoric, not a serious analytical term. In 2003 it was served-up to start a war; today it’s being unrolled to justify options for nuclear escalation. The Iraq adventure may have discredited WMD-speak among the general public, but the term is still being wheeled-out in politicised strategic analysis. Ludicrous suggestions that US nuclear missiles are equivalent to, say, a rogue state’s stocks of mustard gas are being manipulated to quash growing calls for the role of nuclear weapons to be limited to the deterrence of nuclear war; instead, it’s said by Washington, nuclear weapons have additional roles and uses. Now, Washington’s nuclear weapons might be needed to deter aggressive nuclear-armed regimes. But this has been confused in US thinking with justifying plans to start nuclear escalation. This is reckless and unwise, for two reasons. First, Washington is most unlikely to use nuclear bombs against the likes of Iran, not least because doing so would probably trigger a political and moral disaster. Second, the unintended - but loud - signal sent by Washington is that these weapons are essential, so non-proliferation is for mugs. The United States is doing a lot of posturing for the sake of a policy on first-use that offers little strategic benefit and may backfire. It also reinforces perceptions of the neocons as wreckers - happy to talk-up the flaws in the NPT system as an excuse strut their stuff, but unable to come up with a better alternative. These folk are not likely to embrace the spirit in which Rudd’s commission has been proposed. Unfortunately, however, waiting for the demise of the neocons with the next presidential election will not necessarily solve the problem. They are simply the loudest advocates of an American approach to nuclear weapons which has deep roots. Bill Clinton’s presidency helps illuminate the point. He was interested in exploring alternatives to the Cold War addiction to the first-use option - but not interested enough to invest the political capital required to make the shift. Key parts of the Pentagon bureaucracy found it easy to dilute, circumvent and ultimately derail suggestions that Washington should adopt a clear stance of no first use. When Clinton tried to move on an associated front, by backing the CTBT, it was the Senate which pulled him into line. Today, both presumptive presidential candidates, John McCain and Barack Obama, look like they would be better guardians of Washington’s place in multilateral non-proliferation than George W. Bush. Both want additional cuts to the US nuclear arsenal, and both resist calls for a new generation of “bunker-buster” nuclear warheads (often seen as the most suitable weapons for first-use); in addition, McCain has said he would reconsider his 1999 opposition to the CTBT. And, predictably, both Obama and McCain mouth platitudes and clich©s about lessening the risk of nuclear war. Obama has also said it would be “a profound mistake” to use nuclear weapons in the war on terror (although Hilary Clinton’s negative, hairy-chested and point-scoring response to this sensible view showed that in America there can still be a political risk in ruling out the nuclear option). Only time will tell whether the next president will push for a turnaround in US strategic thinking, which currently institutionalises - in the form of diplomatic recalcitrance at NPT meetings, strategic analysis, indoctrination of military personnel, and war planning - a self-declared American right to start nuclear war. • Andy Butfoy lectures in international relations at Monash University.

50|$|After the 2004 election, many {{expected}} that Chief Justice William Rehnquist {{would be forced}} to step down from the United States Supreme Court. Cheney and White House Counsel Harriet Miers were tasked with finding a suitable replacement, and they settled on D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals John Roberts and Fourth Circuit Judge Michael Luttig, both widely respected conservatives, as the two finalists. In June 2005, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor unexpectedly announced that she would step down from the court, and Bush nominated Roberts for her position the following month. After Rehnquist died in September, Bush briefly considered elevating Associate Justice Antonin Scalia to the position of Chief Justice, but instead chose to nominate Roberts for the position. Roberts won confirmation from the Senate in a 78-22 vote, with all Republicans and a narrow majority of Democrats voting to confirm Roberts. To replace O'Connor, the <b>Bush</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> find a female nominee, but was unsatisfied with the conventional options available. The president settled on Miers, but her nomination immediately faced opposition from conservatives feared her unproven ideology and lack of judicial experience. After Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist informed Bush that Miers did not have the votes necessary to win confirmation, Miers withdrew from consideration. Bush nominated Samuel Alito, who received strong support from conservatives but faced opposition from Democrats. Alito won confirmation in a 58-42 vote in January 2006.|$|R

[...] In reviewing this book, The Guardian called it [...] "the most comprehensive independent analysis {{of the state of}} knowledge about Iraq's weapons programmes until the new team of inspectors went back."
