2500|$|Bob Willis {{opened the}} bowling {{with a stiff}} breeze behind him, but Peter Lever found it too much going into the wind and Mike Hendrick (2/64) {{replaced}} him after one over. Hendrick got Wally Edwards to mis-hook a short ball to a tumbling Dennis Amiss. At the other end Ian Redpath was backing away to leg to avoid Willis's bouncers, but exposed his off-stump and was yorked for 5, leaving Australia 10/2. The Chappell brothers recovered the innings with a stand of 100 runs in 155 minutes with Denness rotating his bowlers every four overs so they could rest. Ian Chappell was out of form and took 97 minutes to make 11 runs, but after lunch the fast bowlers were replaced by Tony Greig, who suffered as the brothers took advantage of his poor length. In {{the end it was}} Derek Underwood who dismissed Greg Chappell for 58 with the best ball of the day, a leg-spinner which clipped the edge of his bat and was taken by Keith Fletcher at slip. The Australian captain started arguing with Greig as the lanky bowler's footmarks were in line with the stumps and obliterating Chappell's <b>block</b> <b>mark.</b> Greig kept scuffing the <b>block</b> <b>mark</b> to even the ground so he would not trip and Chappell kept re-marking his block until they looked like schoolboys kicking dirt at each other. Chappell built up another partnership of 87 with Ross Edwards until the captain reached 90, decided to attack the bowling in the last hour of play and hooked Willis (4/56) into the hands of Greig, soon followed by Doug Walters who hooked him to Lever. Edwards was caught behind by another deadly delivery from Underwood (2/54) and 197/3 became 205/6 and 216/6 at stumps. The overnight batsmen Rod Marsh and Terry Jenner had to face Willis with the new ball and Jenner mis-hooked him to square-leg, where Lever ran 22 yards to take the catch. Marsh was beaten by Hendrick's swing and was caught by Denness to leave Australia 228/8 and in real trouble when they were saved by a wagging tail. The 6'4" [...] Max Walker started swinging the bat for 41 not out and added 29 with Dennis Lillee, who fell over trying to hook a medium-paced bouncer from Greig (1/70) and gloved the ball to the wicketkeeper Alan Knott, who had missed a chance off Walker at 242/8. After Lillee had given Greig a few words of discouragement and walked off Jeff Thomson hit 23 and added 52 runs for the last wicket until he was run out by a brilliant pick up and throw from the England captain and Australia were all out for 309.|$|E

Neil was also {{the recipient of the}} 1995 Bistro Award for Best Musical for his show Asylum in the Night, a revue of Neil's theater music. Neil had an evening dedicated to his music at Joe's Pub, produced by BrodwayWorld.com, and returned to Feinstein's for a two-week engagement in July 2011 after a sold out performance in 2010. Neil studied musical composition with Robert Printz, Sue Peters, and is a product of The BMI Musical Writer's Workshop, mentored by Maury Yeston and Skip Kennon. Neil {{was also one of the}} lead Producers, and driving force of the Award Winning 2013 Off-Broadway revival of Maltby and Shire's Closer Than Ever, at The York Theater. Neil's guidance brought the show first to Queens Theater in the Park and The Bristol Riverside Theater with original stars, Lynn Wintersteller and Sally Mayes, before recasting the show when it came into NYC, with Christiane Noll, Jenn Colella, George Dvorsky, Sal Viviano, and Rita Harvey. Reviews were some of the strongest in the 2012-2013 NYC theater season, and led to winning the Off-Broadway Alliance Award for Best Musical Revival. As owner of Leftfield Productions, Inc., an entertainment company based in Nyack, NY, Neil has produced over a thousand Broadway concerts worldwide with such legends as Michael Crawford, Bernadette Peters, Ben Vereen, Audra McDonald, Betty Buckley, Rita Moreno, Donna McKechnie, Brian Stokes Mitchell, Jeremy Jordan, Norm Lewis, Liz Callaway, as well as Alice Ripley, Stephanie <b>Block,</b> <b>Mark</b> Kudisch, Capathia Jenkins and many others.|$|E

This study investigates the impact of different educational activities on students&# 39; academic performance in a problem-based learning curriculum. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study conducted on the cardiology block at the College of Medicine, King Saud Bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. All students who undertook the cardiology block during the academic year 2011 – 2012 were included. The students&# 39; attendance was measured using their overall attendance percentage. This percentage is a product of their attendance of many activities throughout the block. The students&# 39; performance was assessed by the final mark obtained, which is a product of many assessment elements. Statistical correlation between students&# 39; attendance and performance was established. Results: A total of 127 students were included. The average lecture attendance rate for the medical students in this study was found to be 86 %. A significant positive correlation was noted between the overall attendance and the accumulated students&# 39; <b>block</b> <b>mark</b> (r= 0. 52; P< 0. 001). Students&# 39; attendance to different education activities was correlated to their final mark. Lecture attendance was the most significant predictor (P< 0. 001), that is, 1. 0 % increase in lecture attendance has predicted a 0. 27 increase in students&# 39; final <b>block</b> <b>mark.</b> Conclusion: Class attendance has a positive effect on students&# 39; academic performance with stronger effect for lecture attendance compared to attendance in other teaching modalities. This suggests that lecture attendance is critical for learning even when a problem-based learning medical curriculum is applied.

30|$|In [8], {{a general}} tone-mapping, {{represented}} by the logarithm function, is considered and applied to the luminance of the given HDR image, thus obtaining the LogLuv domain. The watermark embedding is performed by applying a quantization-index-modulation (QIM) approach [9] to the approximation subband of the discrete wavelet transform of the LogLuv component. Specifically, the image is divided into different blocks of random shapes, and the coefficients of each block are modified {{in order to make}} the block kurtosis equal to a non-uniformly quantized value determined by the bit to be embedded into the <b>block.</b> <b>Mark</b> imperceptibility is obtained by applying a local perceptual mask based on luminance, texture, and contrast that provides the maximum amount of distortion that each coefficient in the embedding domain can withstand without resulting in visible artifacts. Experimental tests conducted on 15 HDR images include an objective analysis on mark imperceptibility evaluated through the HDR-Visual Difference Predictor (HDR-VDP) metric [10] and on the robustness of watermark detection against seven different TMOs as well as to the addition of Gaussian noise in the HDR domain.|$|E

40|$|We present cost models {{appropriate}} for large file memory DRAMs that exploit error-correcting codes, redundant elements and bad <b>block</b> <b>marking</b> {{in order to}} reduce the average cost per working bit. Many different fault-tolerance methods have been considered previously for DRAM but, because of the constraints of conventional commodity memory, only a few methods, such as redundant rows and columns, have entered wide-spread use. Our research on file memory breaks from past work by relaxing the requirements that random-access be fast and that shipped devices contain 100 % of the nominal working bit capacity. We show that, under the relaxed requirements of file memory, the greater potential efficiencies of large ECC codewords and bad <b>block</b> <b>marking</b> may become cost-effective. These file memory techniques may thus be a way of accelerating the economic production of 256 Mbit and 1 Gbit DRAMs. 1...|$|R
