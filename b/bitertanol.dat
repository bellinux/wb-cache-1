40|$|The {{effects of}} {{fungicide}} <b>bitertanol</b> on cytochrome P 450 -dependent monooxygenases were studied using rats treated intraperitoneally with the N-substituted triazole for 4 days. Treatment with 10, 25, and 100 mg/kg <b>bitertanol</b> produced 2 -, 4 -, and 14 -fold increases of 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation activity in liver microsomes, respectively. Immunoblot analysis of microsomal proteins revealed that 25 mg/kg <b>bitertanol</b> increased CYP 1 A 1 protein in the liver, kidney, and lung by 10 -, 13 -, and 17 -fold, respectively. <b>Bitertanol</b> produced smaller increases of CYP 2 B and CYP 3 A catalytic activity and protein {{than that of}} CYP 1 A 1 in liver. RT-PCR analysis of total RNA indicated that bitertanol-induced CYP 1 A 1, CYP 2 B, and CYP 3 A mRNA. Additions of 0. 01 - 100 mu M <b>bitertanol</b> to liver microsomes from rats treated with 25 mg/kg <b>bitertanol</b> or 3 -methylcholanthrene inhibited microsomal 7 -ethoxyresorufin O-deethylation activity (IC 50 = 0. 8 or 0. 9 mu M). <b>Bitertanol</b> at 100 mg/kg increased liver UDP-glucuronosyltransferase and glutathione S-transferase activities by 2 -fold. <b>Bitertanol</b> at 25 mg/kg produced a minor increase in metabolic activation of benzo[a]pyrene by liver S- 9 fraction in the Ames mutagenicity test while the increase was blocked by addition of 100 mu M <b>bitertanol.</b> These findings show that <b>bitertanol</b> is an inducer of CYP 1 A 1, CYP 2 B, and CYP 3 A in vivo and an inhibitor of CYP 1 A catalytic activity in vitro.

Spore suspensions were point-inoculated on media amended with various concentrations of fungicides and the {{minimum inhibitory concentration}} (MICs) of the fungicides was determined. Most isolates were highly resistant to carbendazim, forming colonies even at concentrations of 100 mg L- 1 of the fungicide. A few isolates failed to form colonies with carbendazim concentrations of 0. 1 and 10 mg L- 1; these isolates were designated carbendazim-sensitive and moderately carbendazim-resistant respectively. The MIC of DMI fungicides was up to 1 mg L- 1 with some isolates, and the mean MICs of <b>bitertanol,</b> flusilazole and myclobutanil were 0. 133 ± 0. 036, 0. 075 ± 0. 044 and 0. 230 ± 0. 038 mg L- 1 respectively. The MIC of the QoI fungicides was up to 0. 1 mg L- 1 with most isolates, but some isolates were 100 -fold less sensitive to azoxystrobin.

40|$|Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp is an {{indigenous}} food legume in Africa, which has great production potential, especially {{in areas with}} low agricultural resources. During surveys of cowpea fields in southern Africa, a new foliar disease was recorded. Alternaria cassiae Juriar&Khan was consistently isolated from diseased plant material. Pathogenicity was confirmed using Koch's Postulates. The effect of different culture media, temperature, light and wounding on the growth and sporulation of the fungus was studied. A. cassiae grew well and produced conidia abundantly when maintained on V 8 -agar at 25 °C in a 12 h UV-light/ 12 h dark cycle. Sporulation was further enhanced by wounding the cultures. The pre-penetration and infection process of A. cassiae on cowpea leaves was studied by light and scanning electron microscopy. Conidia germinated within 2 - 3 h post inoculation (hpi), forming multiple germ-tubes randomly that grew in any direction across the leaf surface. By 8 hpi terminal or intercalary appressoria were formed above epidermal cells or over stomata. Occasionally germ-tubes entered stomata, without the formation of appressoria. Penetration of the plant surface, whether directly through the epidermis or indirectly through stomata was observed 72 hpi. Following penetration bulbous primary hyphae were observed within the sub-stomatal cavities, secondary hyphae developed from the primary hyphae and grew within the intercellular spaces penetrating epidermis and mesophyll cells. A. cassiae is a necrotrophic fungus as the infection process is characterised by a destructive necrotrophic phase where plant cells became necrotic even prior to fungal penetration. Conidial morphology, types {{and development of the}} fungus were studied in vitro on different culture media and in vivo on cowpea leaves. A. cassiae produced a mixed population of three conidial types. Conidia were formed singly or in chains of 2 - 4 conidia. Conidia with long, filiform beaks and conidia with shorter beaks, converted into secondary conidiophores were more frequently produced than mature, beakless conidia on all the media, except on potato dextrose agar. Conidial body and beak sizes were variable when measured in culture and on cowpea leaves. Conidia produced in culture were larger, than those produced in vivo. Conidiophores emerged directly through the epidermis or stomata or were formed when hyphae growing on the leaf surface differentiated into conidiophores. Smooth, bud-like conidial initials were produced at the apex of conidiophores. Conidia matured and became elliptical to obvate and densely verrucose. Once a mature conidium had detached, a small pore was visible at the apex of the conidiophore. A. cassiae was shown to be seed-borne in cowpea. Six fungicides i. e. Benomyl, <b>bitertanol,</b> captab, mancozeb, propiconazole and triforine were evaluated for their efficacy in reducing mycelial growth of A. cassiae in vitro. All fungicides except benomyl proved to be effective. Cowpea seeds were artificially inoculated with A. cassiae and treated with all the fungicides except benomyl. Percentage germination and infection was determined in vitro. Percentage emergence, disease incidence, root and shoot lengths and abnormalities were determined in greenhouse trials. Only <b>bitertanol</b> at l. 5 x the recommended dosage significantly reduced percentage germination. All treatments except triforine l. 0 x and l. 5 x significantly decreased the percentage infection of artificially inoculated seeds. None of the treatments except <b>bitertanol</b> l. 5 x showed a difference in shoot and root length when compared to the control. Captab l. 5 x the recommended rate proved to be the best treatment over all. Dissertation (MSc (Botany)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2006. Plant Scienceunrestricte...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{estimation}} of {{octanol-water partition coefficient}} (log P-ow) was developed for triazole fungicides by micellar electrokinetic chromatography (MEKC). Five standard compounds with known log P-ow values from 2. 9 to 4. 3 (cyproconazole, bromuconazole, epoxiconazole, <b>bitertanol</b> and difenoconazole) were used for constructing the calibration curve of the log P-ow against the MEKC retention factor, log k. A linear relationship was achieved between log P-ow and log k, in the MEKC system containing 40 mM sodium deoxycholate (SDC) and 4 mM borate buffer at pH 9. 3, with a correlation of determination, r(2) = 0. 9905. The log P-ow values of four test compounds of triazole fungicides (triadimenol, myclobutanil, propiconazole and penconazole) were calculated based on the log k values measured by MEKC and the slope and intercept of the calibration curve. This MEKC method can give good {{estimation of}} the log P-ow of the four test compounds of triazole fungicides with {{the differences between the}} literature log P-ow values and estimated log P-ow from the MEKC method were from 0. 15 to 0. 23 log units...|$|E

Bisphenol A showed estrogenic effects on {{both male and female}} carp hepatocytes, however 4 -nonyphenol showed an estrogenic effect (detected in 2 of 3 measurements) on only female cells. Of the agrochemicals tested,tolclofos-methyl and methoxychlor showed an estrogenic effect on male hepatocytes but methoxychlor did not show the effect on female cells. Furthermore, a screening tes t of anti-estrogenic effects was carried out on 76 chemicals. Tributyltin compounds showed a potent inhibition on VTG induction by 17 β-estradiol in carp hepatocyte culture. Especially,　the anti-estrogenic effect seemed to be potent in female rather than male carp hepatocytes,suggesting a different response to endocrine disrupting chemicals between male and female carp.

Genome descriptors for fungal cytochrome P 450 sterol 14 a-demethylase and multidrug efflux pump PMR 1 were generated and correlated with pEC 50 by partial least squares. Toxicants were modeled at the PM 3 level. Novel Activity – Structure Relationships (ASRs) were established to predict toxicant structural features from biological activities and to identify and classify the strains. New types of relationships to model and predict biological activities are Quantitative Genome –Activity Relationship (QGAR) and Quantitative Genome/ Structure –Activity Relationship (QGSAR). QGAR for demethylation inhibitors had a reasonable regression [Q 20. 79, R 20. 81, Standard Error of Validation (SEV) 0. 34] and was extended into QGSAR with improved statistics (Q 20. 85, R 20. 87, SEV 0. 29).

40|$|Demethylation {{inhibitor}} (DMI) -resistant {{strains of}} the plant pathogenic fungus Penicillium digitatum were shown to be simultaneously resistant to cycloheximide, 4 -nitroquinoline-N-oxide (4 NQO), and acriflavine. A PMR 1 (Penicillium multidrug resistance) gene encoding an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter (P-glycoprotein) was cloned from a genomic DNA library of a DMI-resistant strain (LC 2) of Penicillium digitatum by heterologous hybridization with a DNA fragment containing an ABC-encoding region from Botrytis cinerea. Sequence analysis revealed significant amino acid homology to the primary structures of PMR 1 (protein encoded by the PMR 1 gene) and ABC transporters of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (PDR 5 and SNQ 2), Schizosaccharomyces pombe (HBA 2), Candida albicans (CDR 1), and Aspergillus nidulans (AtrA and AtrB). Disruption of the PMR 1 gene of P. digitatum DMI-resistant strain LC 2 demonstrated that PMR 1 was an important determinant of resistance to DMIs. The effective concentrations inhibiting radial growth by 50 % (EC 50 s) and the MICs of fenarimol and <b>bitertanol</b> for the PMR 1 disruptants (Δpmr 1 mutants) were equivalent to those for DMI-sensitive strains. Northern blot analysis indicated that severalfold more PMR 1 transcript accumulated in the DMI-resistant strains compared with those in DMI-sensitive strains {{in the absence of}} fungicide. In both DMI-resistant and -sensitive strains, transcription of PMR 1 was strongly enhanced within 10 min after treatment with the DMI fungicide triflumizole.

40|$|AbstractTwo {{pesticide}} mixtures {{were investigated}} for potential endocrine activity. Mix 3 consisted of <b>bitertanol,</b> propiconazole, and cypermethrin, and Mix 5 included malathion and terbuthylazine {{in addition to}} the three pesticides in Mix 3. All five single pesticides and the two mixtures were investigated for their ability to affect steroidogenesis in vitro in H 295 R cells. The pesticides alone and both mixtures affected steroidogenesis with both mixtures causing increase in progesterone and decrease in testosterone. For Mix 5 an increase in estradiol was seen as well, indicating increased aromatase activity. The two mixtures were also investigated in pregnant rats dosed from gestational day 7 to 21, followed by examination of dams and fetuses. Decreased estradiol and reduced placental testosterone were seen in dams exposed to Mix 5. Also a significant increase in aromatase mRNA-levels in female adrenal glands was found for Mix 5. However, either of the two mixtures showed any effects on fetal hormone levels in plasma or testis, or on anogenital distance. Overall, potential aromatase induction was found for Mix 5 both in vitro and in vivo, but not for Mix 3, an effect likely owed to terbuthylazine in Mix 5. However, the hormonal responses in vitro were only partly reflected in vivo, probably due to some toxicokinetic issues, as the pesticide levels in the amniotic fluid also were found to be negatively affected by the number of compounds present in the mixtures. Nonetheless, the H 295 R assay gives hints on conceivable interference with steroidogenesis, thus generating hypotheses on in vivo effects...|$|E
40|$|In vitro {{studies were}} {{conducted}} into {{the activity of}} 22 fungicides against Phaeomoniella chlamydospora, the cause of Petri disease(1). Mycelial growth of the pathogen was inhibited by the DMI fungicides, cyproconazole, <b>bitertanol,</b> tebuconazole, fenarimol, myclobutanil and prochloraz, which gave EC 50 values of less than 0. 2 mg l- 1; by the benzimidazole fungicides, benomyl, carbendazim and thiophanate methyl, which gave EC 50 values of less than 0. 4 mg l- 1; by the anilopyrimidines, pyrimethanil and cyprodinil/fludioxonil, which gave EC 50 values of less than 0. 02 mg l- 1. The same fungicides had different effects on germination of conidia. All the DMI fungicides tested were relatively ineffective with EC 50 values greater than 15 mg l- 1 for germination. Of the benzimidazoles, only benomyl was relatively effective at reducing germination, with an EC 50 value of 0. 09 mg l- 1, whereas the anilopyrimidines, alone or combined with phenylpyrrole, were effective with EC 50 values of less than 0. 1 mg l- 1. Kresoxim-methyl, which is locally systemic, was effective at inhibiting mycelial growth and germination with EC 50 values of 0. 086 and 0. 11 mg l- 1 respectively. Of the contact fungicides tested, most were effective at reducing germination of P. chlamydospora conidia, since their EC 50 values were {{much lower than the}} recommended field rates, but these fungicides were also much less effective at reducing mycelial growth, for which their EC 50 values were up to 400 times greater. The disinfectant, hydroxyquinolene sulphate was highly effective at reducing germination but less effective against mycelial growth, with EC 50 values of 0. 002 and 8. 5 mg l- 1 respectively.

40|$|Ergosterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (EBIs) have {{a remarkably}} {{broad spectrum of}} antifungal activity. They belong to the commercial fungicides which exhibit the highest activity known to date. Resistance to EBIs was found in vitro, but the level of resistance and the decreased fitness of resistant strains led to the hypothesis that resistance to EBIs was rather unlikely to develop in practice. Despite the fact that EBIs were introduced as early as 1972, up to 1980 only data on EBI-resistant laboratory strains were available. However, gradually there appeared reports on decreased sensitivity to EBIs in practice. This made it of interest to investigate the potential development of resistance to EBIs in vivo. In this study the pathogen used to gather the desired information was Sphaerotheca fuliginea, as this fungus is widespread in cucumber glasshouses in the Netherlands, intensively controlled with fungicides and resistance-prone. This thesis contains five papers describing several aspects of resistance to fungicides in S. fuliginea. In the first paper {{it has been shown}} that S. fuliginea is present on cucumber plants all year round. A gradual increase in the number of infected crops, in the form of S-shaped curves, was observed from planting until May. In the districts with the highest crop density (Pijnacker), mildew was generally observed early in the growing season, while the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was higher than in other districts. In the district with the lowest crop density (Northern Netherlands), mildew was observed late in the growing season and the apparent rate of increase of infected crops was low. Early in the growing season the pathogen is probably dispersed by transportation of infected planting stock and by man. When the disease pressure increases, inoculum is probably dispersed by wind. This implies that inoculum is highly mobile and that, in the case of development of resistance to fungicides, the resistant strains will disperse to crops where the spray regime did not cause resistance to develop. As S. fuliginea developed resistance to dimethirimol, benzimidazoles and pyrazophos in 1971, 1972 and 1979, respectively, it was thought that presence of strains resistant to these fungicides might provide information on the long-term fitness of these strains. The results of an investigation are presented in the second paper. Strains resistant to these fungicides still persisted in the pathogen population. Although this finding may indicate that the long-term fitness of these strains is equal to that of wild-type strains, several other factors might be involved in the persistence of resistance. From 1981 to 1984, S. fuliginea in the Netherlands was primarily controlled with EBIs. The short-term fitness of isolates of S. fuliginea resistant to EBIs and their behaviour under practical conditions are described in the third, fourth and fifth paper. Several fitness parameters of EBI-resistant isolates collected from commercial glasshouses were compared to those of isolates with a wild-type sensitivity to EBIs. Fitness parameters studied were germination of conidia, growth of germ tubes and mycelium, penetration, sporulation and competitive ability. The results are described in the third paper. One or more values of fitness parameters for EBI-resistant isolates were significantly lower than those for the wild-type isolates. However, in general it was concluded that the fitness of EBI-resistant S. fuliginea isolates, collected in commercial glasshouses, was hardly reduced. Within the group of EBI-resistant isolates tested no significant relation was observed between the degree of resistance to EBIs and the degree of fitness. In the fourth and fifth paper the resistance to EBIs of S. fuliginea over a three-year period has been described. In 1981 the sensitivity of glasshouse isolates to EBIs was lower than that of the wild-type isolates. In 1982 and 1983 the sensitivity decreased further. In 1984, no significant differences in sensitivity with the 1983 level were apparent. Per district, the degree of resistance appeared to be positively correlated to the frequency of application of EBIs. Isolates collected in the district of Limburg, where EBIs were applied less frequently than in the district of Pijnacker, showed a significantly higher sensitivity to EBIs than isolates collected in Pijnacker. Triforine showed a very low efficacy in controlling glasshouse isolates. This is in accordance with the experience of growers who, therefore, only use triforine when the disease pressure is low. It is concluded that the decreased sensitivity to triforine can be regarded as resistance. In the case of <b>bitertanol,</b> fenarimol and imazalil, a change to shorter spray intervals has up till now been sufficient to achieve proper control. Contrary to earlier presumptions that development of resistance to EBIs seemed rather unlikely, it gradually developed in normal commercial practice. The slowly decreasing sensitivity to EBIs of cereal powdery mildew is in line with the results described in this thesis. Strategies to delay resistance to EBIs are necessary. Alternation with other site-specific and multi-site fungicides must be advised and can be applied immediately. Non-EBI fungicides are registered for control of cucumber powdery mildew in the Netherlands. Appropriate information and guidance by extension officers and fungicide manufacturers may lower the reluctance of growers to use these strategies. In the long run, control of S. fuliginea might only be maintained by a form of integrated control, which accepts less than perfect disease control. Biological and chemical control, induced resistance of cucumber plants, epidermal coating and mildew-tolerant cucumber cultivars are elements that may fit into a strategy for integrated control of cucumber powdery mildew...|$|E
