5|$|Early in its life, forecasters had {{difficulties}} {{regarding the}} future track {{and intensity of}} Danielle, including a northeastward motion instead of its loop. After Danielle executed its loop, forecasters consistently predicted a landfall along the northeastern North Carolina coastline. As a result, officials issued Tropical Storm Warnings for the coast of North Carolina on September 24, 36hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> passed {{to the east of}} the state. The continued northward motion caught forecasters off guard, and consequentially tropical storm warnings were not issued for the Delmarva Peninsula until just 12hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> made landfall. In addition, forecasters issued tropical storm warnings from Delaware through Watch Hill, Rhode Island, as a precaution.|$|E
5|$|A {{hurricane}} watch {{was issued}} for the northwestern Bahamas on October17, which was upgraded to a warning and expanded {{to cover the}} central Bahamas on the next day. A tropical storm warning was later issued for the southeastern Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos Islands. The airport in Nassau was closed <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck, and 40people in Georgetown on Exuma island evacuated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> {{affected}} Réunion, Bejisa passed west of Tromelin Island, producing {{winds of}} 80km/h (49mph). The storm also produced heavy rainfall on Mauritius. Rainfall and gusty winds also affected portions of Madagascar. Later, Bejisa produced high waves {{along the coast}} of KwaZulu-Natal in South Africa.|$|E

5|$|In Ciudad Juárez, Chihuahua, {{across the}} U.S. border from El Paso, Texas, {{rainfall}} from the storm's remnants flooded 20neighborhoods, downed power lines, {{and resulted in}} several traffic accidents.

5|$|In Texas, the Weather Bureau {{notified}} people {{early enough}} to allow mass evacuations: most coastal residents and camping visitors evacuated the vulnerable islands as the storm neared.

5|$|No tornado watches or {{warnings}} {{were issued}} <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck. This was later {{determined to be}} because of missing atmospheric sounding data, {{as well as an}} incorrect assessment of the height of the tropopause, which led to an underestimation of the strength of the thunderstorm which produced the tornado. Although a severe thunderstorm warning was issued at 2:57 pm, very few people received the warnings in time.|$|E
5|$|On August 29, a {{hurricane}} watch was issued {{from the mouth}} of the Altamaha River in Georgia to Cape Fear, North Carolina.

In South Carolina, voluntary evacuations occurred in Charleston and Colleton counties.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{hurricane}}'s {{arrival in}} the United States, the National Weather Bureau issued several hurricane warnings. As the storm passed over western Cuba, warnings were declared {{for much of the}} Gulf Coast of Florida and all ships in the Gulf or planning to set sail were advised return and remain at port. Warnings were then issued for the northern Gulf Coast, allowing residents time to evacuate <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck.|$|E

The warning occurred 90minutes <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> made landfall. All warnings were discontinued when Bertha weakened to a tropical depression over Louisiana. No watches or warnings were required for Texas, due to the improbability of it re-intensifying.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Tammy {{surprised}} forecasters when {{it formed}} on October 5. Because {{they had not}} expected the disturbance to develop, warnings were not issued until about 12hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> made landfall. Despite the short warning, tourists and business travelers cancelled flights as the storm neared landfall. Upon the storm developing, a tropical storm warning was immediately issued for the coast from Cocoa Beach, Florida to the Santee River, South Carolina.|$|E
5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> reached Atlantic Canada, the Meteorological Branch of the Department of Transport {{provided}} notices for {{the advancing}} storm. On {{the day of}} the storm, the forecast from the Halifax weather office was for light winds, and although it was amended to highlight severe conditions, boats in the region had no radio to learn of the threat. There were many salmon in the region, which prompted fishermen to set sail. As the storm approached, there were about 45 boats in the Northumberland Strait between New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island.|$|E

5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck, Honduras {{was facing}} {{decreased}} food supplies due to ongoing El Niño conditions.

Hurricane Mitch set back the economies of various countries in the region, including Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala, and El Salvador, after they had improved throughout the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Officials in Delaware and Maryland {{declared}} a state of emergency <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck, and thousands of people from coastal communities evacuated to shelters.

Along Long Island in New York, hundreds of thousands of people evacuated their homes, and a state of emergency was declared for several counties. In Connecticut, about 20,000 people evacuated along the coast, and 7,300 evacuated from neighboring Rhode Island. Residents also evacuated portions of Cape Cod.|$|E
5|$|Princes Margret Hospital, the island's only hospital, {{suffered}} {{damage to the}} roofs of the psychiatric and intensive care units. This led to heavy water damage, which also spread into the maternity ward and damaged the electrical system. All of the patients had been evacuated <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> arrived.

5|$|<b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm's</b> arrival, {{residents}} of Grand Isle, Louisiana, were evacuated. As a weak tropical storm, damages from Hermine were light. Rainfall spread from Louisiana through Georgia, causing isolated flash flooding. In some areas, <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> tide prolonged <b>the</b> coastal flooding from a tropical cyclone. Gusty winds were reported. Associated tornadoes in Mississippi damaged mobile homes and vehicles, and inflicted one injury. While Hermine {{was not of}} itself a particularly damaging storm, its effects combined {{with those of other}} tropical cyclones, and resulted in agricultural damage.|$|R
5|$|Some {{residents}} of Vilankulo attempted {{to flee the}} area carrying belongings and children as the government urged residents to seek shelter on higher ground further inland <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> hit. They evacuated {{many of the people}} who remained, taking them to tent camps. Officials said that Favio could also bring heavy rains to Zambia, Malawi and Zimbabwe. Authorities in the latter issued a flood warning. Because of the topography of the region, meteorologists noted the potential for flooding in Zimabawe.|$|E
5|$|When the BoM first classiifed Lam as Tropical Low 13U, {{the agency}} also issued a cyclone {{watch for the}} Cape York Peninsula and Arnhem Land. <b>Before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> struck, {{officials}} transported residents in Lam's path by air to the capital city Darwin. All 426people living in Warruwi were airlifted, and the storm caused many schools {{in the region to}} be closed; students from Warruwi continued classes after they evacuated to Darwin. Residents anticipated Lam's intensity to be lower at landfall, which left some off guard.|$|E
5|$|About 16hours <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm</b> {{moved through}} the Lesser Antilles, the {{government}} of Saint Lucia declared a tropical storm warning.

Combined {{with the threat of}} Hurricane Charley, Bonnie forced the evacuation of 154oil platforms and 32oil rigs. The cease in production was equivalent to over 1.2million barrels of loss in crude oil, or 0.2% of the annual oil production in the Gulf of Mexico. Natural gas reserves were also limited. The lack of gas production due to the storms was equivalent to 7.4% of the total daily production in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> days <b>before</b> <b>the</b> <b>storm's</b> {{arrival in}} Florida, the Weather Bureau issued 40tropical cyclone-related advisories.

In southern Florida, residents boarded up homes and businesses, and sought shelter in large structures. Hurricane parties took place in bars and hotel rooms, while some residents sat in hotel lobbies, listening to radio broadcasts.
