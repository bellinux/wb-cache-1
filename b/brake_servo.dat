25|$|Land Rover's radically updated {{product line}} was {{launched}} in 1983. Initially only the long-wheelbase One Ten was available and it was sold with the same engine line-up as the preceding Series III model- 2.25-litre petrol and diesel engines and the 3.5-litre Rover V8. However, Land Rover planned a series of rolling improvements. Launched shortly before the short-wheelbase Ninety model in 1984 was a 2.5-litre diesel engine. This {{was little more than}} an updated version of the existing diesel unit (at this time 22 years old). The stroke was lengthened to improve torque, and an updated cylinder head was used to reduce noise and emissions. A more modern injector pump improved fuel economy and an improved glow plug system improved cold-starting performance. The most significant change was the swapping of the chain-driven camshaft for one driven by a fibre toothed belt, which also drove the repositioned injector pump. The drive vacated by the injector pump was used to power a vacuum pump for the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> system. To reduce engine weight, extensive use of aluminium castings was made for the cambelt case, vacuum pump, rocker cover and other parts. Other small improvements were made such as the fitment of a spin-on cartridge oil filter instead of older, harder-to-change element type and the fitting of under-piston oil jets. In the mid-1980s Land Rover was part of the Land Rover Group, responsible for production of the Freight Rover van. The 2.5-litre diesel was fitted to the Freight Rover 300-series and the FX4 taxi (the engines for these applications had slight design changes, such as higher-mounted injector pumps and non-waterproof cambelt cases. They received the designations 14J and 15J respectively. Being fitted with a timing belt rather than a chain the 15J engine suffered none of the reliability problems in the FX4 that its 10J predecessor had encountered (see above)). The engine became a special-order only option after the introduction of turbodiesel engines (see below) but remained in production (and popular with military and some commercial buyers) until 1994. The British Army used this engine {{in the vast majority of}} the 20,000 Land Rovers it bought between 1985 and 1994. A manufacturing flaw with pistons combined with Army maintenance practises (such as a tendency to over-fill the sump with oil) caused the engines to over-breathe and ingest their oil, leading to piston failure. Late military-spec engines had a centrifugal separator in the breather system, allowing excess oil to drain back to the sump. These engines were designated 13J. and 11J (ref Land Rover Defender Military 110 1991 Supplementary Parts Catalogue). These later, modified engines were the first in their class (small capacity high-speed diesels) to pass the Ministry of Defence's arduous 500-hour durability trial.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{drum brake}} designs {{have at least}} one leading shoe, which gives a servo-effect. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always {{proportional}} to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> braking pedal, or lever. This tends to give the driver better [...] "feel" [...] and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to [...] "bell mouthing" [...] and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.|$|E
50|$|As a result, {{production}} was suspended in 1978 while the braking problems {{were resolved by}} some engineering changes including removing the <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sport 1.3 S (Tipo 818.362/363): 1968-69. An updated Sport 1.3 with 1,298 cc (818.303) engine {{producing}} [...] at 6,000 rpm. These Sports were normally {{fitted with}} <b>brake</b> <b>servos.</b> It is recognizable by its larger hubcaps, decorated with Lancia flag logos {{instead of being}} plain.|$|R
5000|$|As {{in every}} Bristol saloon since the 404, a {{compartment}} accessed via a hinged panel between {{the front of}} the driver's door and the rear of the front wheel arch housed the battery, fuse panel, windscreen wiper motor and <b>brake</b> <b>servos.</b> [...] A similar panel {{on the other side of}} the car housed the spare wheel and jack.|$|R
5000|$|The First Philips {{machine was}} model number N1500, {{after which the}} format is also known. This had [...] "first generation" [...] {{mechanics}} including magnetic <b>braking</b> <b>servo</b> systems applied to relatively large mains voltage induction motors. The {{outer edge of the}} cabinet was wooden. The power cable was detachable, but used an obscure connector for which replacements are not readily available.|$|R
50|$|There {{were some}} {{changes to the}} 14/28 chassis and {{suspension}} and the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> was deleted. Production ended in 1929, after approximately 700 cars had been built.|$|E
50|$|The Rekord B had {{introduced}} Rekord buyers to a dual circuit braking system the previous year, and this feature was {{carried over into}} the Rekord C along with the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> and front-wheel disc brakes.|$|E
5000|$|Berlina GTE (Tipo 818.310/311): 1968-69. Introduced in 1968 {{with the}} 1298 cc (818.302) engine from the Coupé Rallye 1.3, for an output of [...] at 6000 rpm. In {{addition}} the brakes were uprated with a <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b>|$|E
50|$|Rear springs were 15 inches {{longer than}} in the {{previous}} model. The <b>brakes</b> had <b>servo</b> assistance.|$|R
50|$|Vacuum {{is often}} used to drive {{auxiliary}} systems on the vehicle. Vacuum-assist <b>brake</b> <b>servos,</b> for example, use atmospheric pressure pressing against the engine manifold vacuum to increase pressure on the brakes. Since braking is nearly always accompanied by the closing of the throttle and associated high manifold vacuum, this system is simple and almost foolproof. Vacuum tanks were installed on trailers to control their integrated braking systems.|$|R
50|$|When {{owned by}} GEC {{in the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, many (if not the vast majority) of Lincoln {{engineering}} firms did not survive difficult financial conditions. This included Clayton Dewandre, (who made vacuum and air-pressure <b>brake</b> <b>servos</b> and associated equipment for commercial vehicles). W.H.Dorman had been bought by English Electric in 1961 and took over an old R & H factory on Beevor Street. Dormans would be bought by Perkins in 1993, then closed in 1995.|$|R
50|$|Engines {{fitted with}} three SU HS4 {{carburettors}} and an improved camshaft were {{announced at the}} end of May 1961. Other changes included a vertical barred front grille. Optional extras were similar to the Mark I. From August 1961 a <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> was also available as an optional extra, which greatly improved braking performance.|$|E
50|$|The braking {{configuration}} {{was also}} essentially {{that from the}} previous Rekords, with a dual circuit hydraulically controlled system along with the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> as before, and incorporating, on larger engined versions, a brake force limiter for the rear brakes. The car used disc brakes at the front and drum brakes at the back.|$|E
50|$|Power {{assisted}} brakes are supplied as standard. However, {{because the}} vacuum supply {{from the engine}} in-let manifold that normally supplies the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> is not available on an electric vehicle, a dedicated vacuum pump is used. (Typical operation of the vacuum pump is on for 10-15 seconds and off {{for a couple of}} minutes).|$|E

50|$|The <b>brakes,</b> with vacuum <b>servo</b> assistance, were on {{the rear}} wheels only.|$|R
50|$|The Zodiac was an {{upmarket}} {{version of}} the Zephyr 6, but differed considerably from that model by the limousine-type rear doors, sharper roofline (with narrower C-pillar) and tail, unique grille (four headlights instead of two), exclusive bumper bars, plusher seating, and up-market upholstery, dashboard and interior fittings. A choice of individual or bench front seat was available trimmed in leather or cloth. The front doors and bonnet panels were shared with the Zephyr 6. The Executive version had extra luxury fittings again. The 2553 cc single-carburettor six-cylinder engine was improved internally to increase the power output to 109 bhp and a new four-speed all synchromesh transmission with column change was fitted. The <b>brakes,</b> <b>servo</b> assisted, use discs at the front and drum at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Many new BMW petrol engines {{do not use}} a {{throttle}} {{in normal}} running, but instead use [...] "Valvetronic" [...] variable-lift intake valves to control the amount of air entering the engine. Like a diesel engine, manifold vacuum is practically non-existent in these engines and a different source must be utilised to power the <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b>|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} notable {{features}} of the H6 was its brakes. They were light-alloy drums on all four wheels with power-assist {{the first in the}} industry, driven with a special shaft from the transmission. When the car was decelerating, its own momentum drove the <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> to provide additional power. This technology was later licensed to other manufacturers, including arch-rival Rolls-Royce.|$|E
50|$|Following this spell at Aston Martin, he {{returned}} to Ford in 1995, taking over as director of Service Engineering within the Customer Service Division, his time there being most noticeable for an early television appearance in a combative appearance opposite Anne Robinson on the BBC's Watchdog programme, robustly defending Ford's handling of a safety recall campaign for <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> assist pumps in its diesel car range.|$|E
5000|$|LuAZ began {{developing}} {{a replacement for}} the 969A in 1974, the 969M; it entered production in 1979. It was named Volin, for the region around Lutsk (where the factory was located). It retained the [...] engine, but changed to disk <b>brakes</b> with <b>servo</b> assist. Door locks were added. Folding windshield was standard.|$|R
5000|$|In early 1965, the four-speed {{transmission}} {{was replaced}} with a closer spaced five-speed unit, while the <b>brakes</b> received <b>servo</b> assistance. The 1500 became the tipo 118K, along with a slight engine upgrade for [...] (83 SAE). The range {{was replaced by the}} new 124 coupés and spiders in 1966, although the 1500 Coupé continued to be sold into 1967.|$|R
5000|$|Three Fourteens were on Hillman's stand, a 2-door drop head coupé, a 4-door safety tourer and a 6-light Weymann saloon with a {{sunshine}} roof. Front seats {{could now}} slide for adjustment and a petrol gauge was provided {{on the instrument}} panel. The <b>brakes</b> receive <b>servo</b> assistance on the safety model. All the cars displayed had safety glass.|$|R
50|$|A {{hydraulic}} {{dual circuit}} brake {{system with a}} <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> is used. The front wheels have disc brakes, that are - except for the 518i - internally ventilated. All models with 2.4 l displacement or less have rear drum brakes, while all models with 2.5nbsp;l or more displacement have non internally ventilated rear disc brakes. To prevent the wheels from blocking, BMW equipped the E28 with an anti-lock braking system, although it was an option in some markets.|$|E
50|$|Mechanically, {{this model}} is fitted with a torque {{vectoring}} rear differential, able to send 100% of the torque {{to the left or}} right wheel, and, on the model which debuted in July 2015, a six-speed manual transmission, made by ZF. The braking system uses carbon ceramic rotors, six-pot front and four-pot rear calipers, and auxiliary rear calipers for the parking brake. The electronic stability control and the traditional <b>brake</b> <b>servo</b> are combined in a single electromechanical system.|$|E
50|$|Together {{with the}} Giulia 1300 Ti, the GT 1300 Junior pioneered {{the use of}} ATE disc brakes as later fitted {{throughout}} the 105 series, replacing the Dunlop discs on earlier cars. The first few GT 1300 Juniors lacked a <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> and had the low rear wheelarches of the Giulia Sprint GT and Giulia Sprint GTV. From 1967, a servo was fitted as standard, together with higher rear wheelarches as adopted later on the 1750 GTV.|$|E
50|$|The Fit Hybrid uses an Earth Dreams 1.5-liter Atkinson cycle DOHC i-VTEC engine {{paired with}} a 7-speed DCT (dual-clutch transmission) and an {{internal}} high-output motor, IPU (Intelligent Power Unit) with lithium-ion battery, electric <b>servo</b> <b>braking</b> system with variable servo ratio control.|$|R
50|$|The final {{model used}} a Röhr chassis with {{independent}} suspension all round. At the front a {{transverse leaf spring}} was used. <b>Servo</b> <b>brakes</b> were fitted. The eight-cylinder engine was also by Röhr, but the six was probably a Continental unit.|$|R
50|$|A {{brake booster}} {{is used on}} {{virtually}} all vehicles which use hydraulic brakes for their primary <b>braking</b> circuit. Vacuum <b>servos</b> are not used on vehicles which use cables, rods (or other mechanical linkages), or pressurized air systems for their primary brake circuits.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, the Mercedes-Benz W112 {{platform}} featured an {{air suspension}} on the 300SE models. The system used a Bosch main valve with two axle valves {{on the front}} and one on the rear. These controlled a cone-shaped air spring on each wheel axle. The system maintained a constant ride height utilizing an air reservoir that was filled by a single-cylinder air compressor powered by the engine. In 1964, the Mercedes-Benz 600 used larger air springs and the compressed air system also powered the <b>brake</b> <b>servo.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{following}} years the types ACL2, BDF1, BDF2 and BDS1 were introduced, and were produced {{until the early}} summer of 1940 when the unexpected speed of the German invasion {{put an end to}} most passenger car production in France. Two changes towards the end of 1937 were the introduction of Renault's newly developed mechanical <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> as well as the removal of one of the two access points for the fuel tank which from now on had to be filled using a single fuel filler on the right hand side of the rear panel.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{drum brake}} designs {{have at least}} one leading shoe, which gives a servo-effect. By contrast, a disc brake has no self-servo effect and its braking force is always {{proportional}} to the pressure placed on the brake pad by the braking system via any <b>brake</b> <b>servo,</b> braking pedal, or lever. This tends to give the driver better [...] "feel" [...] and helps to avoid impending lockup. Drums are also prone to [...] "bell mouthing" [...] and trap worn lining material within the assembly, both causes of various braking problems.|$|E
50|$|Steering was by cam and lever {{with the}} box {{mounted on the}} car's frame. From 1932 the <b>brake</b> vacuum <b>servo</b> motor was run from the car's gearbox. Brakes were on all four wheels and {{operated}} by rods, drums were enclosed. The front brakes used the Perrott principle. The central hand lever used the same brake shoes at the back as the foot brake. Springs were semi-elliptical and flat with gaiters and shock absorbers. The rear springs were outside the frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} years saw the radiator grille painted black (rather than grey). In 1976, the 101L replaced the De Luxe model, featuring new bumpers with rubber trim, flat-folding seat backs, chrome-trimmed radiator grille, reverse light, electric windshield-washer pump, coolant-temperature gauge, cigarette lighter and <b>servo</b> <b>brakes.</b>|$|R
50|$|A larger car, the Ascot Gold Cup Six with a 2423 cc six-cylinder engine {{possibly}} made by Continental, three-speed gearbox and <b>servo</b> <b>brakes</b> {{did become}} a reality and a few production cars were made. It was advertised as being available as a two-seat sports, coupé or fabric saloon.|$|R
