5|$|Gray's Inn's {{internal}} records {{date from}} 1569, {{at which point}} there were four types of member; {{those who had not}} yet <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the Bar, Utter Barristers, Ancients and Readers. Utter Barristers were those who had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the Bar but were still studying, Ancients were those who were called to the Bar and were allowed to practise and Readers were those who had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the Bar, were allowed to practise and now played a part in educating law students at the Inns of Chancery and at Gray's Inn itself. At the time Gray's Inn was the odd one out amongst the Inns; the others did not recognise Ancients as a degree of barrister and had Benchers roughly corresponding to the Readers used at Gray's Inn (although the positions were not identical).|$|E
5|$|Altgens {{and former}} Texas Governor John Connally met by chance in Houston {{a short time}} later. Connally told Altgens that he also had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> testify and {{received}} airfare, but he decided to cash the check and spend the money. Connally pressed Altgens to spend his as well. Altgens later learned {{that they were not}} required to attend.|$|E
5|$|At 2 a.m. on {{the night}} of 18 October 2015, a group of 30 Jews, on {{instruction}} from Rabbi Eliezer Berland, went to the tomb without permits, in contravention of a standing IDF order, to clean and paint the compound that was burned three days before. As they were attacked by local Palestinians, six of them were bruised by beatings, and one of their vehicles was burnt. They claimed that the Palestinian police, who had detained them, had also beaten them, before they were handed over to the Israeli army, which had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> extract the others.|$|E

50|$|Bazin <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the Barreau du Québec in 1965, {{starting}} with {{the law firm of}} Byers Casgrain. He worked there for twenty-two years until he <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the Senate.|$|R
50|$|Giani <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the Bar in India in 1999. Thereafter he <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the Bar of England and Wales in 2006 at the Honourable Society of Gray's Inn, London.|$|R
5|$|During the 19th century, the Inns {{began to}} stagnate; little {{had been changed}} since the 17th century in terms of legal {{education}} or practice, except that students were no longer bound to take the Anglican sacrament before their call to the Bar. In 1852 the Council of Legal Education was established by the Inns, and in 1872 a formal examination for the call to the Bar was introduced. Gray's Inn itself suffered more than most; as in the 18th century, the fortunes of its members declined, and many barristers who had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the Bar at the Inn transferred to others.|$|E
5|$|The artist's {{reputation}} {{was such that}} he had already <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> Rome {{a number of times}} in the early 1540s; first by Cardinal Pietro Bembo and then by the Farnese family. By the mid-1540s Titian was the preferred portraitist for the Farnese. Following a number of earlier portraits of Pier Luigi and Paul, they commissioned a set to mark their ascendancy after Paul's papacy, all of which were– given their political awareness and ambition– clearly intended as public statements on their social elevation. Paul was aware of Titian's influence in Venice, and after 1538 allowed only Titian to portray him.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses {{called by}} the State {{supported}} Farrar's and the prosecutors' earlier claims that police had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the home {{a month before the}} fire, that Green's behavior had been cause for concern at the time, and that Farrar had turned in to police at that time seed packets containing castor beans. The Earl May store clerk who had identified Green as the purchaser of multiple packets of castor bean seeds testified to that effect. Medical evidence was presented that Farrar's illness had not fit neatly within the parameters of any known disease, but that its presentation matched the symptoms of ricin poisoning. An FBI criminologist provided testimony that he had tested for ricin antibodies in Farrar's blood approximately two months after Farrar's last acute symptoms, and found antibodies there in such large amounts that he could confidently state that Farrar had been subjected to repeated exposures to ricin.|$|E

50|$|Thatcher <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an apostle and {{a member}} of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in April 1879. He <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> replace Orson Hyde, who died on November 28, 1878.|$|R
50|$|He <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the rabbinate of Tarlow and Lisko, small Galician towns. In 1717 he {{replaced}} Rabbi Tzvi Ashkenazi in the chief rabbinate of Lemberg; and thence he <b>was</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> Berlin in 1731.|$|R
5|$|According to the police, the {{passengers}} behaved very calmly, given the circumstances. Keč allowed several of {{the passengers}} to use their mobile telephones, allowing {{one of them to}} communicate with the police and keep Sheriff Jan Bergen updated on the situation. Anti-terror police had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the scene, and there were plans to storm the aircraft if the situation escalated. After the incident, the police refused to say if they would have stormed the aircraft if Keč followed through his threats to depart to another airport. During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which the police confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} Detective Chief Superintendent Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> the property. Other than the front door, {{which the first}} two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
5|$|Pope Agatho held a synod in October 679, which {{although}} it ordered Wilfrid's restoration {{and the return}} of the monasteries to his control, also directed that the new dioceses should be retained. Wilfrid was, however, given the right to replace any bishop in the new dioceses to whom he objected. The council had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> deal with the Monothelete controversy, and Wilfrid's concerns were not the sole focus of the council. In fact, the historian Henry Chadwick thought that one reason Wilfrid secured the mostly favourable outcome was that Agatho wished for Wilfrid's support and testimony that the English Church was free of the monothelete heresy. Although Wilfrid did not win a complete victory, he did secure a papal decree limiting the number of dioceses in England to 12. Wilfrid also secured the right for his monasteries of Ripon and Hexham to be directly supervised by the pope, preventing any further interference in their affairs by the diocesan bishops.|$|E

5|$|The {{deaths of}} Sylvester Q. Cannon and Rudger Clawson created two {{vacancies}} in the LDS Church's Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in mid-1943. On July 8, 1943, Kimball received {{a telephone call}} from J. Reuben Clark, the first counselor to church president Heber J. Grant, notifying him that he had <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> fill one of the vacancies. Kimball was initially so shocked by the call that he asked Clark's permission to ponder it for several days before he went to Salt Lake City to meet with him in person, as part of a previously-scheduled family trip. After the phone call, Kimball's desire to accept the calling was overwhelmed by feelings of self-doubt and incompetence. His wife, Camilla, recounted that although her husband was not prone to tears, he afterward lay on the floor of their home and wept uncontrollably as she tried to comfort him. After an intense emotional and spiritual struggle, Kimball had an unusual dream, which gave him peace on his ability to accept the calling. He was ordained an apostle by Grant and added to the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in the Salt Lake Temple on October 7, 1943. Grant had chosen Ezra Taft Benson to fill the other vacancy in the Quorum, and he and Kimball were ordained on the same day. As he was four years older than Benson, Kimball was ordained first, which put him ahead of Benson in the Quorum's seniority.|$|E
5|$|After {{pitching}} {{with the}} Athletics in spring training, manager Connie Mack placed Christopher {{on the major}} league roster, and he made his debut on April 14, 1942. On May 5, Christopher made his first appearance as a starting pitcher against the Detroit Tigers. The Athletics won the game, 2–1, and {{he got his first}} major league win. After another win five days later, he began a long losing streak. Many of the games he did pitch were in relief, including a game in June against the Cleveland Indians where he only allowed one hit in three innings. He got his third win of the season three months after his second on August 20 in a 2–1 victory over the Washington Nationals. He finished the season with a 4–13 record, a 3.82 ERA, 30 total games, 58 strikeouts and 99 walks. The following season, Christopher re-signed with the Athletics, {{and was one of the}} few remaining pitchers from the previous year on the team, the rest having <b>been</b> <b>called</b> <b>to</b> serve in World War II. He began the season in the starting rotation, winning his first start of the season against the Boston Red Sox in a 5–0 shutout. Over the course of the season, he converted to a sidearm pitching delivery, which led to three victories in a row for him. After a July 9 loss to the Tigers brought his record to 4–6, Christopher did not pitch again until August 24, and spent the rest of the season pitching in relief. He finished the season with a 5–8 record and a 3.45 ERA.|$|E
