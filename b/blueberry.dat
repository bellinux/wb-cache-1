40|$|Bachelor´s thesis named "Health {{importance}} of phytochemicals in berries focused on weight-reducing diet" {{deals with the}} weight-reducing diet containing phytochemicals and its health effect on human heatlh. In theoretical part of the thesis, I focused on weight-reducing diet and bioactive substances, and I described phytochemicals and <b>blueberries</b> in detail. The formation of a two-week weight-reducing diet containing polyphenols correspondig {{with the amount of}} 120 ml natural <b>blueberries</b> a day was the goal of my thesis. The exploration of food products as fully-fledged sources of polyphenols was my next goal. For the processing of the research I have examined food products containing <b>blueberries,</b> which were made in the South Bohemian region, specifically through interviews with leaders and representatives of various companies and I found all the necessary information about each food products containing <b>blueberries.</b> The amount of polyphenols was determined by HPLC (High Performance Liquid Chromatography) which was conducted under the leadership of doc.

40|$|<b>Blueberries</b> {{have many}} health {{benefits}} such as high content of anthocyanins, phenols and other antioxidants, which could prevent cancer and cardiovascular diseases. However, the texture of <b>blueberries</b> can easily deteriorate during handling, processing and distribution, which leads to food loss. This is a particular problem when <b>blueberries</b> are irradiated {{as a treatment for}} food safety purposes. This research evaluated the effects of vacuum impregnation on the texture and quality of irradiated <b>blueberries.</b> Moisture content, texture, color, total soluble solids, pH, total titratable acidity, and total phenol amount were evaluated on Day 0 (the day of the treatment), Day 7, and Day 14 of storage at 4. 5 - 5 ?C, 50 - 55 %RH. A consumer test was also conducted. Fresh <b>blueberries</b> were vacuum impregnated with calcium lactate solution at 4 %, 5 %, and 6 % concentration (w/w).

40|$|<b>Blueberries</b> are a {{rich source}} of {{phenolic}} compounds, especially anthocyanins, which contributes to their high level of antioxidant activity. However, these compounds of significant health benefit will be degraded after the <b>blueberries</b> undergo various air drying processes.

In this study, a mechanical wax abrasive pretreatment is used to carefully remove the wax layer and reduce drying time. The abrasive drum was lined with medium grain sand paper and attached to a constant speed rotator. The amount of <b>blueberries</b> and the rotating time were optimized to reduce the damage to the <b>blueberries.</b> Rabbiteye <b>blueberries</b> cv. Climax were used as the test fruit.

Both had their experiences in the American West to draw upon but felt, thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and <b>Blueberry,</b> that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin suggested that they turn their hands to science fiction, a genre that, at that time, was not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in Pilote and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E

In Mexico, each farmer packs on site and sells directly, or may transport to a warehouse for storage until the berries are sold. Tunnels are often used to grow <b>blueberries</b> in Europe and this makes the season longer. This creates an opportunity to move crops into earlier or later markets to get better prices.|$|R

5|$|During the Cold War, new U.S. Air Force bases were {{constructed}} {{along the northern}} border of the continental U.S.; their most direct route to the Soviet Union was through the Arctic Circle. These sites were high-importance strategic bases for hosting long-range missiles and aircraft. In 1947, the New England Division of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers chose a site in northeastern Maine, within both the Limestone Township and Caswell Plantation. The remote site consisted mostly of dense forest, shallow marshes, and wild <b>blueberry</b> bogs, on a slight plateau over the town, which helped keep it above the fog most of the time. Only {{a small part of}} the base was suitable for farming, so there was little impact on Aroostook County's agricultural community. Additionally, Loring was not far from sources of materials for runway, taxiway, and parking apron construction. The most important benefit of the site was that it was a few hundred miles closer than any other base to potential targets in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Most of North Island is {{dominated}} by chenopod shrubs, generally less than a metre (3ft) high. The beach vegetation is largely Spinifex longifolius (beach spinifex), Salsola kali (prickly saltwort), Atriplex cinerea (grey saltbush) and naturalised Cakile maritima (sea rocket). Stable dunes are vegetated by Atriplex paludosa (marsh saltbush), Scaevola crassifolia (thick-leaved fan-flower), Olearia axillaris (coastal daisy-bush), Myoporum insulare (<b>blueberry</b> tree) and Exocarpos sparteus (broom ballart). Sheltered areas behind dunes support Salsola kali and Myoporum insulare and also Nitraria billardierei (nitre bush), the last of these being the only plant on the island to grow over m (5ft) high. In areas where limestone {{is close to the}} surface, the vegetation consists of Pimelea microcephala (shrubby rice-flower), Spyridium globulosum (basket bush) and Acanthocarpus preissii.|$|E
5|$|When winter {{came and}} there was no work {{available}} on the ranches, he collaborated with Christin on a six-page strip called Le Rhum du Punch, a copy of which he sent to Jean Giraud who was by now writing and illustrating <b>Blueberry</b> for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine Pilote. Giraud showed the strip to Pilotes editor, Rene Goscinny, who agreed to publish it (issue 335, 24 March 1966). This was followed by another collaboration titled Comment réussir en affaires en se donnant un mal fou (How to succeed in business by almost killing oneself through hard work) which was also published in Pilote (issue 351, 14 July 1966). By this stage Mézières visa was almost expired and so he used the money from these strips to pay for his ticket home. In leaving America, Mézières also left behind a young woman, Linda, one of Christin's students: she followed him to France some months later and is now his wife.|$|E

5000|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} a common health problem that trouble some {{individuals}} and {{may be able to}} be prevented by eating wild <b>blueberries.</b> Tannins, which are found in wild <b>blueberries</b> and cranberries, can prevent the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections from attaching to the wall of the bladder and urinary tract. Thus allowing them to pass through the body without causing any harm. Due to the dark pigments in red wine caused by anthocyanins which are the same pigment as in wild <b>blueberries</b> it is proven to lower the risk of heart disease. Making it a reasonable assumption to expect that wild <b>blueberries</b> may have the same effect on lowering the risk of heart disease.|$|R
40|$|Ripening <b>blueberries</b> {{are subject}} to serious damage {{by a variety of}} bird species. Through a {{questionnaire}} survey, Pearson (1958) calculated that losses of highbush <b>blueberries</b> to birds in Massachusetts averaged about $ 38, 000 a year in 1955 - 57. From a 1972 questionnaire on bird damage to highbush <b>blueberries</b> directed to individuals in 14 states, Mott and Stone (1973) estimated that birds damaged at least 5 % of the crop, representing a minimum nationwide loss of about $ 1. 6 million. Most species of birds that feed on <b>blueberries</b> are not only desirable but also protected under the Migratory Bird Treaties Act. Any means of reducing this damage must therefore be nonlethal. Since the experimental insecticide, methiocarb [4 -methylthio) - 3, 5 -xylyl N-methylcarbamate], has recently proved to be an effective, nonlethal repellent for protecting cherries and grapes from damage by birds (Guarino, 1972; Guarino, et al., 1974), initial trials were conducted to determine if methiocarb would protect wild, lowbush <b>blueberries</b> (vaccinium angustifolium) from bird damage...|$|R
5|$|Like all milk-caps (Lactarius and Lactifluus), L.deceptivus is mycorrhizal, {{meaning the}} fungus forms a mutualistic {{association}} with certain trees and shrubs. The subterranean mycelium of the fungus forms an intimate association with tree roots, enveloping {{them in a}} sheath of tissue that allows both organisms to exchange nutrients they would otherwise be unable to obtain. The fruit bodies of the fungus grow solitarily, scattered, or in groups {{on the ground in}} conifer or hardwood forests, often under oak (Quercus) or hemlock (Tsuga). Smith has noted a preference for bogs and the edges of woodland pools in hardwood forests, and in oak stands that have an understory of <b>blueberry</b> bushes (Vaccinium species). It is widely distributed in eastern North America, and has also been reported from southern and western Canada. It is a fairly common species, and fruits from June to October. The mushroom has also been reported from Mexico (in Puebla and in Veracruz) from oak and pine forests, at altitudes slightly over , and from Costa Rica, where it is abundant in oak forests.|$|E
5|$|Several {{studies have}} shown that the spread of Armillaria root rot in {{eucalypt}} forests is associated with infected stumps that remain after an area has been logged. Armillaria luteobubalina can persist on these stumps, using them as a source of food for up to 25 or more years. In one case reported in Ovens, Victoria, the disease was spread to <b>blueberry</b> plants (Vaccinium species) via buried fragments of infected Eucalyptus that remained following preparation of the previously forested site for planting. In individual forest stands, fungal infection is usually found in discrete disease patches separated by stands of healthy trees—a discontinuous distribution. Large-scale aerial photography can be used to identify regions of forest infected by the species. The species also causes damage to trees and bushes in coastal dune woodlands, shrubland, and heath communities. It can be found on a wide range of hosts, but is most commonly associated with (in order of decreasing frequency) jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), bull banksia (Banksia grandis), marri (E.calophylla), Lasiopetalum floribundum, and Acacia saligna. It has also infected scattered populations of wandoo (E. wandoo). The fungus has also been reported to infect Nothofagus species in Argentina, and Pinus radiata in Chile.|$|E
5|$|The large {{diversity}} of the flora around Adams is even more apparent in the herbage and, including the tree and shrub species previously mentioned, totals at least 843 species. This is {{more than any other}} mountain in the Pacific Northwest. The first extensive list of flora from the area around Mount Adams was published in 1896 by William Suksdorf and Thomas Howell and listed 480 species. Suksdorf had taken it upon himself to catalogue as many species around Adams as he could and the list was the result of his extraordinary collection efforts. This was the most complete list for over a century and has finally been updated by David Beik and Susan McDougall to the current 843 species with hundreds of additional species listed. Adams is home to many rare plants including tall bugbane, Suksdorf’s monkeyflower, northern microseris (Microceris borealis), Brewer’s potentilla (Potentilla breweri), and mountain blue-eyed grass. The plant diversity is most evident in the many meadows and wetlands on the flanks of Adams. The notable Bird Creek Meadows includes in its famous display, magenta paintbrush, arrowleaf ragwort, penstemons, lupines, monkeyflowers, mountain heathers, and many others. In wetlands, generally at lower elevations, one can find bog <b>blueberry,</b> highbush cranberry, sundew, purple cinquefoil, and flatleaf bladderwort, in addition to many sedges and rushes. Subalpine and alpine meadows and parklands, while not as prolific as the meadows and wetlands of lower elevations, have a beautiful display as well with partrigefoot, Cascade rockcress, subalpine buttercup, Sitka valerian, alpine false candytuft, elegant Jacob’s ladder, and various buckwheats as prominent players.|$|E
