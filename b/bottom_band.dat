25|$|While not {{technically}} a Georgian flag, this flag is of importance as Georgia {{was one of}} the founding countries of the federation. The Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic's flag was a tricolour design, with a top band of dark yellow, a middle band of black, and a <b>bottom</b> <b>band</b> of red.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{its lack}} of clear {{boundaries}} and a perceived lack of identity in its folk music, the English Midlands attracted relatively {{little interest in the}} early revivals. However, in more recent years a distinct cultural heritage has been recognised including unique folk traditions and songs, many associated with the regions industrial connections. It has also produced a number of important performers and some particular local instruments, such as the Lincolnshire bagpipes, however the last player, John Hunsley, died in the 19th century and no actual examples of the pipes have survived. From the 19th century the instruments used appear to have been much like those in other regions, with fiddles, accordions and eventually silver and brass. Although, some traditions, like Molly dance died out in the 1930s, the Midlands retained strong traditions of both ceremonial and social dance, particularly in the south Midlands and Cotswolds and in the distinctive Border Morris from Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Shropshire. The region also furnished some important material for folk songs, including a claim by Nottinghamshire {{for one of the most}} popular series of ballads, that of Robin Hood, while local places appear in songs such as ‘The Leicester Chambermaid’ and ‘Oxford’ or ‘Worcester City’. Folk song collecting in the first revival was much less comprehensive than for many other regions. In the 1860s Llewellynn Jewitt, collected songs from Derbyshire, and some songs were printed by Georgina F. Jackson in her study of Shropshire folk lore. Cecil Sharp’s interest in the region was largely confined to the south, particularly the Cotswold morris villages of Oxfordshire and Warwickshire, which provided him with an archetype of English ceremonial dance. From 1905 Percy Grainger was actively collecting in Lincolnshire, acquiring recordings of songs that would provide the basis for his Lincolnshire Posy (1937). It was not until the early 1970s that the broader heritage of the region, including the many industrial and work songs associated with mining or The Potteries, began to gain serious attention. Despite this neglect there was an active folk scene in the region, which produced several key artists of the second revival from the 1960s, including Anne Briggs from Nottinghamshire, The Settlers from the West Midlands and from Birmingham one of the most influential groups of the period, the Ian Campbell Folk Group, which numbered among its members later British folk rock musicians Dave Swarbrick and Dave Pegg. Slightly later a number of folk groups came out of Derbyshire, including The Druids, Ram's <b>Bottom</b> <b>Band</b> and Muckram Wakes, which included one of the most highly regarded modern performers John Tams. Lincolnshire has produced Martin Simpson, perhaps the most highly regarded folk guitarist of his generation. Birmingham’s position as a centre for folk music has been emphasised by its place as the home of the Birmingham Conservatoire Folk Ensemble, led by former Albion Band fiddler Joe Broughton, which provides something of a clearing house of promising young folk musicians. The regions has numerous folk clubs and host many major folk festivals, including those of Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, Loughborough in Leicestershire, Shrewsbury in Shropshire, Warwick and Moseley.|$|E

500|$|Unlike the trophies {{awarded by}} the other major {{professional}} sports leagues of North America, a new Stanley Cup is not made each year. Originally, the winners kept it until a new champion was crowned. Currently, winning teams get the Stanley Cup {{during the summer and}} a limited number of days during the season. It is unusual among trophies to include winning members' names. Every year since 1924, a select portion of the winning players, coaches, management, and club staff names are engraved on its bands. However, there is not enough room to include all the players and non-players, so some names must be omitted. Initially a new band added each year, though this caused the trophy to grow in size, earning the nickname [...] "Stovepipe Cup". In 1958 the modern one-piece Cup was designed with a five-band barrel which could contain 13 winning teams per band. To prevent the Stanley Cup from growing, when the <b>bottom</b> <b>band</b> is full, the oldest band is removed and preserved in the Hockey Hall of Fame, and a new blank band added to the bottom. It has been referred to as The Cup, Lord Stanley's Cup, The Holy Grail, or facetiously (chiefly by sportswriters) as Lord Stanley's Mug. The Stanley Cup is surrounded by numerous legends and traditions, the oldest of which is the celebratory drinking of champagne out of the cup by the winning team.|$|E

50|$|In 1990 Playtex {{purchased}} Jogbra from Lisa and her partners. This {{was followed}} by research by Christine Haycock, associate professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey. She measured breast movement of women running on treadmills. Sought out by bra manufacturers for her expertise, she advocated wide <b>bottom</b> <b>bands</b> for extra support and firm straps that minimized breasts bounce. Renelle Braaten, a Montana hairdresser, struggled to contain her double-Ds while playing racquetball and volleyball. Unable to interest mainstream bra manufacturers, she collaborated with freelance apparel designer Heidi Fisk, and founded Enell Incorporated. After considerable lobbying, she persuaded Oprah Winfrey in 2001 to try her bra. This led to very positive reviews in O: The Oprah Magazine, a 2001 appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show, and a huge surge in orders.|$|R

40|$|Rat liver nuclei, after {{preliminary}} {{isolation in}} 2. 2 molar sucrose solution, were separated into density classes by centrifugation at 95, 000 g for 45 to 85 {{minutes in a}} sucrose density gradient (density range, 1. 28 to 1. 33).

Nuclei from regenerating liver (26 hours after one-third hepatectomy) yielded three bands and a pellet fraction with average DNA phosphorus content per nucleus of 0. 76, 1. 02, 1. 38, and 1. 51 picograms (top to bottom of tube).

50|$|The Gewehr 98 oil {{finished}} rifle stock {{features a}} semi-pistol grip. A top handguard was standard on all rifles and {{extended from the}} front of the rear sight base terminating just ahead of the <b>bottom</b> barrel <b>band.</b> A steel cross bolt was mounted to distribute the forces and hence the effects of recoil on the stock bedding, reducing the chance to split the stock. The stock featured a quick detachable sling swivel on the underside of the butt stock, a top swivel located underneath the <b>bottom</b> barrel <b>band,</b> and a parade hook mounted on the underside of the top H-style barrel band. The prewar stocks were produced from walnut wood and were aged for an average of three years to allow the wood to stabilize. Beginning in 1917, walnut shortages necessitated the use of beech wood. The late-war production beech stocks were less durable and heavier than the original walnut stocks.|$|R

40|$|Time-resolved {{luminescence}} spectra {{due to an}} electron-hole plasma (EHP emission) and an exciton-exciton scattering process (P emission) {{were measured}} in ZnO epitaxial thin films under band-to-band excitation by the optical Kerr gate method. We find that both the EHP and P emissions emerge with a long time delay of a few picoseconds. The time delay observed decreases quadratically with the excitation density below the critical Mott density. These results imply that the P (EHP) emission emerges after completing thermal cooling of excitons (electrons and holes) toward the exciton <b>band</b> <b>bottom</b> (renormalized <b>band</b> gap) through multiple LO-phonon emissions. As the excitation density increases, the exciton-exciton scattering process also {{plays an important role}} on cooling and relaxation of high-density excitons. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V.
