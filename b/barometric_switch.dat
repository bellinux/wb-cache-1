The bomb was suspended from the aircraft by two weight-bearing lugs.

Lappo from NII-885, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute, that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002MHz. Signals {{on the first}} frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch. If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded [...] the fan was turned on and when it fell below [...] the fan was {{turned off by the}} dual thermal switch. If the temperature exceeded [...] or fell below , another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses. Sputnik 1 was filled with dry nitrogen, pressurized to 1.3 atm. The satellite had a <b>barometric</b> <b>switch,</b> activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.|$|E
40|$|This {{presentation}} describes two shuttle Get-Away-Special (GAS) experiments {{built by}} McDonnell Douglas to investigate low-g propellant acquisition and gaging. The first experiment was flown on shuttle mission 41 -G in October 1984. The second experiment has been qualified for flight and {{is waiting for}} a flight assignment. The tests performed to qualify these experiments for flight are described, and the lessons learned which {{can be applied to}} future GAS experiments are discussed. Finally, survey results from 134 GAS experiments flown to date are presented. On the basis of these results it is recommended that future GAS experiments be qualified to shuttle thermal and dynamic environments through a rigorous series of mission operating tests. Furthermore, should automatic activation of the experiment be required during the boost phase of the mission, NASA-supplied redundant <b>barometric</b> <b>switches</b> should be employed to trigger the activation...|$|R
40|$|Up to the TEXUS- 44 {{microgravity}} research mission, successfully {{launched in}} February 2008, the payloads of the TEXUS vehicles were exclusively {{equipped with the}} Magellan (former Bristol Aerospace Ltd.) ORSA recovery system, integrated into the ogive nose cone. With the intention to gain more independency from the North American market and the inherent procurement and ITAR regulations problems, the European Space Agency (ESA) has taken initiative to contract industry for the development and built-up of a new European Recovery System (ERS) in 2006. For the design, manufacturing and qualification task sharing, a cooperation of DLR Moraba and the Kayser-Threde GmbH has been initialized. The ERS is designed to recover payloads of up to 450 kg mass and 17 inch (438 mm) diameter by a two-stage subsonic parachute system. It features a separating ogive nose tip with a forward deploying recovery parachute. The assembly incorporates a 3 : 1 fineness ratio ogive which forward portion is ejected exo-atmospherically to permit subsequent parachute recovery system operation. The aft ogive houses the parachute system, autonomous redundant pyrotechnic ignition system, housekeeping electronics, TM interface, beacon system, camera system and pyrotechnic and electronic batteries. The parachute system activation is controlled by <b>barometric</b> <b>switches</b> on the descent trajectory at a nominal altitude of 15 kft (4. 6 km) in the combination of an electronic timing activation unit (ignition unit). Together with the heat shield ejection the drogue parachute is deployed and the payload is mainly stabilized from flat spin and decelerated. After complete stabilization the drogue parachute is separated and extracts the main parachute out of the deployment bag. At fully opened main parachute the final sink rate is around 8 m/sec. ...|$|R

Fuzing was {{by means of a}} <b>barometric</b> 'gate' to <b>switch</b> on the radar altimeter controlled firing circuit. These bomb casings were used for all the air-drop tests at Christmas Island and Maralinga, Australia. Detonation was approximately 52 seconds after release from the aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|At an {{altitude}} of 8000 ft, the fireball would not touch the ground, thereby minimising fallout. The bombs would be detonated with a clockwork timer rather than a <b>barometric</b> <b>switch.</b> This meant {{that they had to}} be dropped from 45000 ft.

The United States had not attempted this until the Operation Redwing Cherokee test on 21 May 1956, and the bomb had landed 4 mi from the target. Aldermaston wanted the bomb within 300 yd of the target, and Oulton felt that a good bomber crew could achieve that. A 550 by 600 nmi km exclusion zone was established, covering the area between 3.5° North and 7.5° South and 154° and 163° West, which was patrolled by Shackletons.|$|E

50|$|On July 26, 1959, Rankin {{was flying}} from Naval Air Station South Weymouth, Massachusetts to Marine Corps Air Station Beaufort in South Carolina. He climbed over a thunderhead that peaked at 45000 ft, then - at 47000 ft and at mach 0.82 - {{he heard a}} loud bump and rumble from the engine. The engine stopped, and a fire warning light flashed. He pulled the lever to deploy {{auxiliary}} power, and it broke off in his hand. Though not wearing a pressure suit, at 6:00 pm he ejected into the -50 C air. He suffered immediate frostbite, and decompression caused his eyes, ears, nose, and mouth to bleed. His abdomen swelled severely. He did, however, manage {{to make use of}} his emergency oxygen supply. Five minutes after he abandoned the plane, his parachute hadn't opened. While in the upper regions of the thunderstorm, with near-zero visibility, the parachute opened prematurely instead of at 10,000 feet due to the storm affecting the <b>barometric</b> parachute <b>switch</b> to open. After ten minutes, Rankin was still aloft, carried by updrafts and getting hit by hailstones. Violent spinning and pounding caused him to vomit. Lightning appeared, which he described as blue blades several feet thick, and thunder that he could feel. The rain forced him to hold his breath to keep from drowning. One lightning bolt lit up the parachute, making Rankin believe he had died. Conditions calmed, and he descended into a forest. His watch read 6:40 pm. It had been 40 minutes since he ejected. He searched for help and eventually was admitted into a hospital at Ahoskie, North Carolina. He suffered from frostbite, welts, bruises, and severe decompression.|$|R
