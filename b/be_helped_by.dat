5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases during the war, and Seward also believed that American trade would <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E
5|$|At over 80, Mondragón {{was still}} able to mount on horseback, though he had to <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> two men and could only wear light armour. He first came to {{prominence}} at the Battle of Mühlberg, in 1547, {{and was one of the}} few Spanish officers of good fame in the rebel provinces, being portrayed in a positive light by contemporaneous Dutch authors such as Hugo Grotius and Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft. Mondragón planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo. Mondragón could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E

25|$|Other {{exterior}} injuries include cuts {{caused by}} toenails piercing adjacent toes. This {{can be prevented}} by keeping toe nails cut short and filed smooth. Also, calluses may form on the bottoms and sides of the feet, which can crack open. This can <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> the use of gel pad protectors on specific problem spots or using pads to surround the toes. Ingrown nails can result from ill-fitting shoes.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} erectile {{dysfunction}} may be psychological or physical. Psychological erectile dysfunction can often <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> almost {{anything that the}} patient believes in; {{there is a very}} strong placebo effect. Physical damage is much more severe. One leading physical cause of ED is continual or severe damage taken to the nervi erigentes. These nerves course beside the prostate arising from the sacral plexus and can be damaged in prostatic and colorectal surgeries.|$|E
25|$|The {{goals of}} {{treatment}} are to reduce pain, decrease inflammation, and improve a person's overall functioning. This may <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> balancing rest and exercise, {{the use of}} splints and braces, {{or the use of}} assistive devices. Pain medications, steroids, and NSAIDs are frequently used to help with symptoms. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as hydroxychloroquine and methotrexate, may be used to try to slow the progression of disease. Biological DMARDs may be used when disease does not respond to other treatments. However, they may have a greater rate of adverse effects. Surgery to repair, replace, or fuse joints may help in certain situations. Most alternative medicine treatments are not supported by evidence.|$|E

25|$|Michael Mikel, another active Cacophonist, {{realized}} that a group unfamiliar with {{the environment of the}} dry lake would <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> knowledgeable persons to ensure they did not get lost in the deep dry lake and risk dehydration and death. He took the name Danger Ranger and created the Black Rock Rangers. Thus the seed of Black Rock City was germinated, as a fellowship, organized by Law and Mikel, based on Evans' idea, along with Harvey and James' symbolic man. Drawing on experience in the sign business and with light sculpture, John Law prepared custom neon tubes for the Man in 1991 so it could be seen as a beacon at night.|$|E
25|$|The rivers {{provide the}} most obvious means of {{transporting}} goods and people. A 700-kilometre boat journey from Basankusu to the capital, Kinshasa, can take several weeks. Major barge operators are Transports Fluvial et Commerce de l'Equateur (TFCE) and Office National des Transports (ONATRA). Passengers often travel in cramped conditions, in some cases travelling atop the logs being pushed along the river by the barges. They are victim to high prices for food and other essentials along the way. The frequent breakdown of these river boats puts passengers in a precarious position regarding daily sustenance; a delay of several days can oblige passengers to sell all their belongings {{so that they can}} buy a meal. The poor communication within the country, generally, means that passengers cannot <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> friends or family.|$|E
25|$|Richardson did not devote all of {{his time}} just to working on his new novel, but was busy {{printing}} various works for other authors that he knew. In 1742, he printed the third edition of Daniel Defoe's Tour through Great Britain. He filled his few further years with smaller works for his friends until 1748, when Richardson started helping Sarah Fielding and her friend Jane Collier to write novels. By 1748, Richardson {{was so impressed with}} Collier that he accepted her as the governess to his daughters. In 1753, she wrote An Essay on the Art of Ingeniously Tormenting with the help of Sarah Fielding and possibly James Harris or Richardson, and it was Richardson who printed the work. But Collier was not the only author to <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> Richardson, as he printed an edition of Young's Night Thoughts in 1749.|$|E

Initially appearing as a doppelganger of Serah, she is eventually {{revealed to be}} an embodiment of Lightning's personal trauma as a child that created a physical form from the Chaos to contain Serah's soul. Lumina meddles in Lightning's journey, aiding her or being a hindrance, before eventually revealing her true identity and integrating back into Lightning's mind once she comes to terms with her need to <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> her friends.|$|E
500|$|A {{week after}} being {{rescued from the}} region, Snake is redeployed into the Soviet jungle as part of [...] "Operation: Snake Eater", to fulfill the United States' promises. During the mission, he gains the {{assistance}} of another American defector, ex-NSA agent EVA, who defected {{a few years earlier}} (though she is informed she would <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> ADAM, who defected with her). After numerous encounters with the elite Ocelot Unit (led by a young Revolver Ocelot), and defeating nearly every member of Cobra Unit, Snake succeeds in locating Sokolov and the stolen Shagohod, only to be captured in Volgin's military fortress, Groznyj Grad. After listening to Volgin brutally beat Sokolov to death, Snake is tortured by Volgin and loses his eye while protecting EVA from Ocelot, who was attempting to kill her upon suspecting her of being a spy; Snake ultimately escapes.|$|E

500|$|Bouchard's speeches asked Quebecers to vote [...] "Yes" [...] {{to give a}} clear {{mandate for}} change, and that only the clarity of a [...] "Yes" [...] vote would provide a final {{solution}} to Canada's long standing constitutional issues and a new partnership with English Canada {{for the betterment of}} both. Bouchard's popularity was such that his remarks that the Québécois were the [...] "white race" [...] with the lowest rate of reproduction, which threatened to cast the project as focused on ethnic nationalism, were traversed with ease. Bloc Québécois MP Suzanne Tremblay was less successful in this regard, and apologized after answering journalist Joyce Napier's question of how minority francophones outside of Quebec would <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> independence by stating that Napier's last name and lack of a Québécois accent made her ignorant of the subject.|$|E
500|$|Walker {{found the}} court {{sections}} [...] "maddening" [...] due {{to how the}} game sometimes requires very specific evidence to be presented, with evidence that he found reasonable being rejected, forcing him to resort to guessing; he wished that the health meter would have been replenished through correct answers, or {{that it had been}} removed from the game entirely. Bryan Vore at Game Informer found the investigation sections tedious at times, but found them to <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> how the psyche-locks add [...] "courtroom drama" [...] to the investigations. Juba thought that the game's reliance on text made the investigations move slowly, but that the game becomes an [...] "irresistible adventure" [...] when the text is mixed with gameplay in the trials. Thomas found the psyche-locks interesting, but underwhelming as the only new feature. East said that the psyche-locks were what made the investigations fun. Reparaz liked how the psyche-lock mechanic adds [...] "a new dimension of weirdness" [...] to the game. Both Harris and Thomas wished that the game had been less linear, with more possible wrong paths to take or more endings. Thomas, Reparaz and East wished that the Nintendo DS-exclusive gameplay features introduced in the first game's final episode had been used in Justice for All, with Reparaz calling it disappointing but [...] "not a huge deal". Villoria and East said that the game does not last very long; Walker did not consider it short, but found it to not last as long as the first game.|$|E
2500|$|These {{processes}} include individual coping strategies, or may <b>be</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> {{a protective}} environment like good families, schools, communities, and social policies that make resilience {{more likely to}} occur. In this sense [...] "resilience" [...] occurs when there are cumulative [...] "protective factors". These factors are likely to play a more important role, the greater the individual's exposure to cumulative risk factors.|$|E

60|$|The {{scene was}} a plain, bare, {{monotonous}} vault of a school-room, and the speaker's square forefinger emphasized his observations by underscoring every sentence {{with a line}} on the schoolmaster's sleeve. The emphasis <b>was</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> the speaker's square wall of a forehead, which had his eyebrows for its base, while his eyes found commodious cellarage in two dark caves, overshadowed by the wall. The emphasis <b>was</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> the speaker's mouth, which was wide, thin, and hard set. The emphasis <b>was</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> the speaker's voice, which was inflexible, dry, and dictatorial. The emphasis <b>was</b> <b>helped</b> <b>by</b> the speaker's hair, which bristled on the skirts of his bald head, a plantation of firs to keep the wind from its shining surface, all covered with knobs, like the crust of a plum pie, as if the head had scarcely warehouse-room for the hard facts stored inside. The speaker's obstinate carriage, square coat, square legs, square shoulders, - nay, his very neckcloth, trained to take him by the throat with an unaccommodating grasp, like a stubborn fact, as it <b>was,</b> - all <b>helped</b> the emphasis.|$|R
