At the time, Britain lacked any operational combat aircraft capable of supersonic flight; as such, meeting the specification required industry to embrace <b>bleeding</b> <b>edge</b> aerodynamic theory, new materials and futuristic propulsion systems. In response, there were a total three submissions made from British aircraft manufacturers: the Handley Page HP.100, Vickers SP4, and the Avro Type 730. All were futuristic delta or needle shapes in appearance employing multiple engines, 12 on the HP.100, 16 mounted horizontally {{at the rear of}} the Vickers. Work on the HP.100 proceeded to a full-scale mockup and large-scale wind tunnel testing. However, in mid-1955, Avro were issued with a contract by the Ministry of Supply to develop their submission aircraft.|$|E
500|$|Nearly 20 {{visual effects}} studios worked on Captain America: Civil War {{including}} Industrial Light & Magic (ILM), Lola VFX, Method Studios, Luma Pictures, Dneg, Image Engine, Trixter, Cinesite, and The Third Floor amongst others. Lola VFX de-aged Downey Jr. {{in a scene}} that involved a younger holographic version of himself. Lola VFX's visual effects supervisor, Trent Claus said, [...] "In this case, we analyzed footage of Mr. Downey at the approximate age {{that we wanted to}} target, which was {{around the time of the}} film Less Than Zero [...]" [...] He also noted the difficulty of the scene, due to it being close to 4,000 frames, and the fact that Downey was moving his head from side to side multiple times. Lola also worked on visual effects for the Vision. The Third Floor extensively previsualized the film including the fight scene at Leipzig/Halle Airport. Gerardo Ramirez, the Previs and Postvis Supervisor for The Third Floor said:We visualized most of the major scenes in the film, some that were more story driven and some that were more action and story driven. The Russos used various methods for planning and they used each department for what it does best. The early edits were a combination of storyboards, previs and stunt performance clips. Stunts would choreograph the hand-to-hand action while the storyboards would be used for character story moments and previs was used for the big action scenes that involved many digital characters. Method Studios, which worked on 440 shots, was responsible for the helicopter sequence in the middle of the film and the climatic fight between Iron Man, Bucky, and Captain America. The original intent for the helicopter sequence was to place the scene next to the Paul-Löbe-Haus, where the Bundestag meets; however, the location was not allowed to be shown in the film, resulting in Method needing to create a full CGI background. For the climatic fight, one of the challenges for Method was getting the color of Iron Man's suit correct, opting to go with a more [...] "classic Iron Man look versus the really glossy car paint look" [...] that Iron Man had in the previous Avengers films. ILM was primarily responsible for the visual effects during the large-scale fight sequence at the airport, along with creating the digital assets for all of the characters. VFX supervisor Russell Earl, stated that the 20 minute scene grew to be an almost fully digital sequence explaining, [...] "We ultimately ended up replacing 99% of everything that was shot with the actors being lifted from the background. Originally both Spider-Man and Black Panther were planned to be photographed elements but we ended up almost completely replacing them." [...] Luma Pictures, who also worked on Winter Soldier, was assigned with completing shots of Bucky's arm and his metal brainwashing chair. They also worked on Bucky's escape from the task force lobby and designed Iron Man's new hybrid nanotechnology armor, which was an homage to the character's <b>Bleeding</b> <b>Edge</b> armor from the comics. Their work totaled approximately 200 shots.|$|E

[...] David Morris Kipen wrote for Publishers Weekly, [...] "It's a peculiarity of musical notation that major works are, more often than not, set in a minor key, and vice versa. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>Edge</b> is mellow, plummy, minor-key Pynchon, his second such in a row since Against the Day (2006)... but in its world-historical savvy, its supple feel for the joys and stings of love--both married and parental--this new book is anything but minor. On the contrary, <b>Bleeding</b> <b>Edge</b> is a chamber symphony in P major, so generous of invention it sometimes sprawls, yet so sharp it ultimately pierces." [...] Michael Jarvis in his review for the Los Angeles Review of Books compared it to modern day cyberpunk literature and wrote, [...] "... all its exuberant visions of transcending the body through cyberspace — lay a deep anxiety {{about what it would}} mean to “value the virtual world more” than the material one, perhaps even to lose the ability to discern or enforce the boundaries between the two. <b>Bleeding</b> <b>Edge</b> manifests, with exquisite poignancy, the full human dimensions of those concerns."

30|$|Another {{common and}} {{simple way to}} address the problem {{consists}} of converting the input image to luminance-chrominance space, blurring the chroma planes and transforming the image back to the original color domain [4]. The main weakness of this technique is the inability to discern between noise and genuine color details; so, when the blurring becomes strong, color <b>bleeding</b> along <b>edges</b> can be introduced. Moreover, large blurring kernels are needed to remove low-frequencies chroma blobs. Another fast solution consists of applying standard greyscale image algorithms to each color plane of the input image independently, but the risk of artefacts or false colors introduction is very high because the correlation among color channels is ignored [5].|$|R
