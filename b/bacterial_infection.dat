40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{professional}} nurses', associate degree prepared nurses', licensed practical nurses', {{and nursing}} assistants' {{knowledge of the}} causes of multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections,</b> the risks theses infections pose to health care providers, the chain of transmission of these infections, and patients' susceptibility to colonization of these multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections.</b> METHODS: This descriptive study was conducted in a major general hospital in Minas Gerais, Brazil. The sample consisted of 42 nursing staff from a medical clinical unit. Descriptive statistics were used to analyze and present the data. RESULTS: Nursing staff had unsatisfactory knowledge {{of the causes of}} multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections,</b> the chain of transmission of multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections,</b> and patients' susceptibility to colonization of multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections.</b> However, the majority of participants had some knowledge about the risks that multi-resistant <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> posed to health care providers.

40|$|Cancer {{patients}} who are leukopenic due to chemotherapy are susceptible to <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections.</b> Normally, clinical conditions during <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> are caused by pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which are components that bind to Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 (TLR- 2) and TLR- 4 on leukocytes, resulting {{in the production of}} inflammatory cytokines. The mechanism of this inflammatory response in cancer patients with diminished numbers of leukocytes is not completely clear. The levels of interleukin 1 (IL- 1) and tumor necrosis factor alpha measured in the circulation of leukopenic cancer patients are lower than those measured in that of nonleukopenic patients during <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections,</b> whereas plasma interleukin 8 (IL- 8) levels show distinct identical increases during <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> in both leukopenic and nonleukopenic patients. Nor-mally, these cytokines are mainly secreted by leukocytes. In cancer patients with <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> and a diminished number of leukocytes, other sources of IL- 8 production, such as endothelial cells, might be expected. Endothelial cells instead of leukocytes become the most important producers of IL- 8 during <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> in patients with chemotherapy-induced leukopenia through TLR- 2 and TLR- 4 signaling. Whole blood samples from six cancer patients were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and then IL- 8 con-centrations in supernatants were measured. Further, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with sera from leukopenic cancer patients with or without <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections,</b> and then IL-...|$|R
40|$|These authors contributed {{equally to}} this work. One {{sentence}} summary: This review discusses {{recent advances in}} the targeted imaging of <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections,</b> a rapidly developing field of microbiological research that aims at distinguishing <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> from sterile inflammation in vivo. Editor: Birgitta Henriques Normark <b>Bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> represent an increasing problem in modern health care, in particular due to ageing populations and accumulating bacterial resistance to antibiotics. Diagnosis is rarely straightforward and consequently treatment is often delayed or indefinite. Therefore, novel tools that can be clinically implemented are urgently needed to accurately and swiftly diagnose infections. Especially, the direct imaging of infections is an attractive option. The challenge of specifically imaging <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> in vivo can be met by targeting bacteria with an imaging agent. Here we review {{the current status of}} targeted imaging of <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections,</b> and we discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches. Indeed, significant {{progress has been made in}} this field and the clinical implementation of targeted imaging of <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> seems highly feasible. This was recently highlighted by the use of so-called smart activatable probes and a fluorescently labelled derivative of the antibiotic vancomycin.

5|$|A rapid strep test may assist a {{clinician}} {{in deciding}} whether to prescribe an antibiotic to a person with pharyngitis, a common infection of the throat. Viral infections {{are responsible for the}} majority of pharyngitis, but a significant proportion (20% to 40% in children and 5% to 15% in adults) is caused by <b>bacterial</b> <b>infection.</b> The symptoms of viral and <b>bacterial</b> <b>infection</b> may be indistinguishable, but only bacterial pharyngitis can be effectively treated by antibiotics. Since the major cause of bacterial pharyngitis is GAS, the presence of this organism in a person's throat may be seen as a necessary condition for prescribing antibiotics. GAS pharyngitis is a self-limiting infection that will usually resolve within a week without medication. However, antibiotics may reduce the length and severity of the illness and reduce the risk of certain rare but serious complications.|$|E

40|$|Background: <b>Bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> {{remain a}} major threat and {{a leading cause of}} death worldwide. Most of the <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> are caused by gram-positive and {{negative}} bacteria, which are recognized by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2 and 4, respectively. Activation of these TLRs initiates multiple pathways that subsequently lead to effective immune response. Although, both the TLRs share common signaling mechanism yet they may exhibit specificity as well, resulting in the release of diverse range of inflammatory mediators which could be used as candidate biomolecules for <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections.</b> Results: We adopted systems biological approach to identify signaling pathways mediated by TLRs to determine candidate molecules associated with <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections.</b> We used bioinformatics concepts, including literature mining to construct protein-protein interaction network, prioritization of TLRs specific nodes using microarray data and pathway analysis.

40|$|<b>Bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> {{are among}} the most {{frequent}} complications of hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). This review describes current epidemiology and management of <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections.</b> Multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria are increasingly frequent in HSCT recipients, but significant differences in etiology of <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> and prevalence of resistant strains exist between different transplant centers. Methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, vancomycin-resistant enterococci and MDR Pseudomonas aeruginosa are the most relevant examples. Infection control measures are mandatory to limit the spread of resistant strains. Selective digestive decontamination is controversial and potentially associated with inducing resistance to antibiotics that might be the last treatment option, such as colistin or aminoglycosides. Empirical therapy should be individualized, and an escalation or de-escalation approach should be chosen depending on local epidemiology, colonization and clinical presentation. Antimicrobial stewardship, with the aim of improving management of <b>bacterial</b> <b>infections,</b> should be put in place in transplant units. <b>Bacterial</b> <b>infections</b> in the transplant population warrant currently particular attention to limit the negative impact of infections caused by resistant strains...|$|R
5|$|Chemicals {{released}} by macrophages can also damage host tissue. TNF-α {{is an important}} chemical that is {{released by}} macrophages that causes the blood in small vessels to clot to prevent an infection from spreading. However, if a <b>bacterial</b> <b>infection</b> spreads to the blood, TNF-α is released into vital organs, which can cause vasodilation {{and a decrease in}} plasma volume; these in turn can be followed by septic shock. During septic shock, TNF-α release causes a blockage of the small vessels that supply blood to the vital organs, and the organs may fail. Septic shock can lead to death.|$|E
