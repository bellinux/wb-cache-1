He learns that Aarohi is working in a bar again and that Vivek had ignored her calls without informing him.

Rahul begins to train Aarohi, who signs a music contract to sing in films and becomes a successful playback singer.

25|$|Hogwarts {{is home to}} {{at least}} twenty ghosts, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> in the novels speak of the ghosts at Hogwarts they are usually {{referring}} {{to one of the}} four resident ghosts of the Hogwarts houses: Sir Nicholas de Mimsy-Porpington (or, as the students refer to him, Nearly Headless Nick), the almost beheaded host of Gryffindor house; the Bloody Baron, who is the ghost of Slytherin house; the jovial Fat Friar, who is the ghost of Hufflepuff house; and the Grey Lady, who is the ghost of Ravenclaw house. These ghosts seem to act as something like advisers and aides to the students; Nick is frequently seen helping Harry during moments of uncertainty or crisis.|$|E

See: Jim R Davila, Unpublished Pentateuchal Manuscripts from Cave IV Qumran: 4QGenExa, 4QGenb-h, j-k, unpublished Ph.D. dissertation, Harvard University, 1988. Cain and Abel also appear {{in a number of other}} texts, and the story is the subject of various interpretations. Abel, the first murder victim, is sometimes seen as the first martyr; while Cain, the first murderer, is sometimes seen as an ancestor of evil. Some scholars suggest the pericope may have been based on a Sumerian story representing the conflict between nomadic shepherds and settled farmers. Modern scholars typically view the stories of Adam and Eve and Cain and Abel to be about the development of civilization during the age of agriculture; not the beginnings of man, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> first learned agriculture, replacing the ways of the hunter-gatherer.|$|E

500|$|Tolkien {{begins by}} noting that the {{original}} book has almost been lost under the extensive [...] "'literature'" [...] (his inverted commas) on the subject. He explains that Beowulf had mainly been quarried as [...] "an historical document", and {{that most of the}} praise and censure of the poem was due to beliefs that it was [...] "something that it was not – for example, primitive, pagan, Teutonic, an allegory (political or mythical), or most often, an epic;" [...] or because the scholar would have liked it to be something else, such as [...] "a heathen heroic lay, a history of Sweden, a manual of Germanic antiquities, or a Nordic Summa Theologica." [...] Tolkien gives an allegory of a man who inherits a field full of stone from an old hall. He builds a tower with some of it, <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> find the stones are older than the tower, they pull it down [...] "to look for hidden carvings and inscriptions".|$|E
500|$|Cryer's {{long run}} of {{unsuccessful}} TV projects finally ended three years later. Against {{the wishes of}} CBS executives (who were aware of his past failures) and due to a friendship with Charlie Sheen, he was cast in 2003 to portray Alan Harper on the hit comedy series Two and a Half Men. He has earned seven Primetime Emmy Award nominations and two wins for his acting work on the show. In a comment on the show's high ratings, he said: [...] "When you’re on a show that's fighting for survival every week, you stop trusting your instincts, because you think, ‘My instincts haven't worked so far.’ <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> clearly like the show and are watching it in great numbers, it takes {{a huge amount of}} pressure off you. It allows you to trust your instincts and go with what has worked for you before." [...] After former co-star Charlie Sheen's departure from the series, Cryer's character became the show's main protagonist (with Ashton Kutcher being cast as the co-lead) throughout the final four seasons, mainly due to the show's retooled plot. At the end of the series of Two and a Half Men, Cryer is the only actor to have appeared in every episode of the series, since Sheen was fired in March 2011 and his on-screen son Angus T. Jones left the series at the end of season 10, after expressing the show as [...] "filth" [...] and that Jones is a [...] "paid hypocrite". All appeared to be forgiven, however, as Jones, contrary to Charlie Sheen, appeared to great applause in the finale. [...] Before being cast for Two and a Half Men, Cryer auditioned for the role of Gaius Baltar on the Sci-Fi Channel's reimagined Battlestar Galactica, but the role went to James Callis. In 2008, Cryer appeared with Laurence Fishburne and James Cromwell in the film Tortured, and in 2009 co-starred with James Spader in the film Shorts.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{different}} types of E. coli, {{some of which are}} found in humans and are harmless. [...] Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a type found to cause illness in humans, possessing gene that allows it to manufacture a substance toxic to humans. Cattle are immune to its effects <b>but</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> eat food contaminated with cattle feces, the organism can cause disease. Reports of pathogenic E. coli appear in medical literature as early as 1947. [...] Publications regarding variants of E. coli which cause disease appeared regularly in medical journals throughout the 1950s, 60s, and 70s, with fatalities being reported in humans and infants starting in the 1970s. Despite the earlier reports, pathogenic E. coli did not rise to public prominence until 1983, when a Center for Disease Control researcher published a paper identifying ETEC as the cause of a series of outbreaks of unexplained hemorrhagic gastrointestinal illness. [...] Despite the earlier publication of pathogenic variants of E. coli, researchers encountered significant difficulties in establishing ETEC as a pathogen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{incident}} sparked {{debate among}} biologists and primatologists on whether gorillas and other primates {{should be held}} in captivity at all. Primatologist Jane Goodall said that according to the video it seemed Harambe was {{trying to protect the}} child. Goodall later issued a longer explanation {{in an interview with the}} president of the International Fund for Animal Welfare, concluding that the zoo had no choice but to kill Harambe. She wrote, [...] "It was awful for the child, the parents, Harambe, the zoo, the keepers and the public. <b>But</b> <b>when</b> <b>people</b> come into contact with wild animals, life and death decisions sometimes have to be made." [...] Goodall said that as long as humans and wild animals are kept in close proximity in zoos, there is no way to prevent accidents from happening, but she believed that zoos [...] "with the highest standards of care" [...] could play an important role. Zookeeper Jack Hanna strongly defended the zoo's actions as the [...] "correct decision", noting that a tranquilizer dart might have taken five or ten minutes to take effect and could have aggravated Harambe further. Primatologist Frans de Waal said he saw few options for the zoo: [...] "A gorilla is so immensely strong that even with the best of intentions—and we are not sure that Harambe had those—the child's death was a probable outcome.” ...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{research}} has shown that nonattachment, or the ability to release from mental fixations, has many positive outcomes (Sahdra, Shaver, & Brown, 2010). Because creativity {{is one of the most}} im- portant pro-social behaviors, we investigated the link between nonattachment and creativity. In addi- tion, we investigated the moderating role of mood. We found that nonattachment was indeed positively related to creativity, <b>but</b> only <b>when</b> <b>people</b> were induced to feel authentic pride, that is, pride which re- sults from attributing success to hard work. The link between nonattachment and creativity disappeared <b>when</b> <b>people</b> were merely induced to feel a positive or neutral mood...|$|R
40|$|The present {{research}} examined when self-evaluation influences creativity. Based on objective self-awareness theory, the authors predicted that feeling able to improve would buffer against the detrimental effects of self-evaluation on creativity. Two experi-ments manipulated self-evaluation (varying self-awareness, Study 1; providing objective performance standards, Study 2) and perceived ability to improve potential failure on the creativ-ity task. Self-evaluation reduced creativity (generating remote associates, finding unusual uses for a knife) in both experi-ments, <b>but</b> only <b>when</b> <b>people</b> {{did not expect}} to improve. <b>When</b> <b>people</b> felt able to improve, self-evaluation did not affect creativ-ity. Connections between self-motives, creativity, and defensiveness are discussed...|$|R
