The first incident of C. sordidus was detected in Kpg. Remun, Gedung, Serian where 90 % of the banana plants were infested. An on farm trial to evaluate the effect of chemical spraying at plant collar and trapping was carried out. Untreated plot served as the control. Only chemical spraying at the plant collar showed significant reduction of weevil damage to the plant. Nevertheless the percentage of damage was still high.

40|$|AbstractMuch of the worlds’ annual harvest loss to {{pests and}} {{diseases}} occurs {{as a consequence}} of crops grown in monocultures, or cultivated varieties with uniform resistance. This uniform resistance is met by the continuing evolution of new races of pests and pathogens that are able to overcome resistance genes introduced by modern breeding, creating the phenomenon of boom and bust cycles. One of the few assets available to small-scale farmers in developing countries to reduce pests and diseases damage is their local crop varietal diversity, together with the knowledge to manage and deploy this diversity appropriately. Local crop varietal diversity of banana and plantain (Musa spp.) and common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) was measured at the community and household levels within farmers’ fields in four agro-ecological areas of Uganda. Resistance of traditional and modern varieties of P. vulgaris to anthracnose, angular leaf spot, and bean fly and of traditional and modern varieties of Musa spp. to black sigatoka, <b>banana</b> <b>weevils</b> and nematodes was assessed from participatory diagnostics of farmer knowledge and cross-site on-farm and on-station trials. By performing cross-site on-farm experiments, it was possible to identify traditional varieties with higher resistance to pest and diseases when grown outside their home sites. Increased diversity of crop varieties, measured by number of varieties (richness) and their evenness of distribution, corresponded to a decrease in the average damage levels across sites and to a reduction of variance of disease damage. In sites with higher disease incidence, households with higher levels of diversity in their production systems had less damage to their standing crop in the field compared to sites with lower disease incidence. The results support what might be expected of a risk-minimizing strategy for use of diversity to reduce pest and disease damage...|$|R
40|$|Crop sanitation, i. e. {{destruction}} of crop residues, has been hypothesized to lower <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> damage by removing adult refuges and breeding sites.

40|$|The <b>banana</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cosmopolites sordidus (Germar), is {{the most}} {{important}} constraint to banana production in East African highlands. For most resource-poor farmers in the region, biological control is the only viable option because it requires little or no cash investment. I investigated patterns of predation by natural enemies of the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> in its presumed native range in Indonesia to determine if there were natural enemies that could be imported to control the pest in Africa. Work was also done in Uganda to determine if predatory insects already present in local banana farming systems could be better conserved to produce <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> control. ^ Through farm surveys in Indonesia, I confirmed existing reports that <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> damage is low in Sumatra and Java. However, I found no evidence of parasitism from 25, 000 eggs and 3600 larvae collected from seven diverse geographical locations. The adult and larvae of the histerid, Plaesius javanus Erichson, were found to be important predators of C. sordidus. P. javanus larva entered tunnels of plants, presumably in search of <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> stages. This predator should be imported to Uganda for establishment as a classical biological control agent of the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil.</b> ^ Experiments in Uganda showed that destruction of crop residues in bananas, as recommended for weevil control and practiced by some farmers, reduced predator numbers on farms, reduced predator: prey ratios and had no benefit to the plant with respect to damage prevention. Instead, I demonstrated that residue presence, through maintaining high predator: prey ratios, offsets damage to plants that would otherwise occur from increased numbers of banana weevils. ^ Ants are the major predatory group now present in banana farming systems in Uganda. Surveys in banana farms found 55 species from pitfall traps, 17 from banana pseudostem residues and 34 from banana corms. Eleven species of ants came to <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> egg and larvae exposed in the field as baits and thirteen species were tested in the laboratory for their potential to attack the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil.</b> Two species—Pheidole sp. 2 (Myrmicinae) and Odontomachus troglodytes (Santschi) (Ponerinae) —caused significant <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae mortality in crop residues and significant egg mortality in living plants in microcosm experiments and in the field. ...|$|E

Both of the banana pseudostems (Berangan and wild banana) were allowed to decay for 1, 3, 5 and 7 days respectively and used for the experiment. Twenty 0. longicollis were released in a special design trap and left overnight. The preferences of the weevils were checked the day after. Results revealed that 7 days of Berangan decayed pseudostem (0. 83) has more attractant property compared to 3 days wild decayed pseudostem (0. 67).

40|$|Polysubstituted tetrahydrofurans {{appear in}} a large variety of {{bioactive}} structures of both natural and unnatural origin. The stereochemistry of the substituents has {{a profound effect on}} function; therefore, the development of new methodology for the stereoselective construction of tetrahydrofuran rings is very attractive. A tandem methodology for the stereoselective synthesis of 2, 3, 5 -trisubstitutedtetrahydrofurans is reported here. This involves a catalytic C-H insertion of diazocarbonyl acetal templates followed by the stereoselective reductive cleavage of the resultant bicyclic acetals. A key area of this project is the formation and reaction of diazoketones. The diazoketones were prepared in good yields (70 - 85 %) by acylation of diazomethane with a mixed anhydride, which involves the initial activation of the acid group of the corresponding acid acetal precursors. Alternatives to the use of diazomethane have been examined but proved to be less efficient. Two routes towards the synthesis of the acid acetals have been examined. A one-pot process involving the treatment of 1, 3 - and 2, 2 -disubstitutedpropane- 1, 3 -diols with pyruvic acid gave poor yields (30 - 38 %). A two-step procedure involving the initial synthesis of pyruvate ester acetals, by ketalisation of 2 -substitutedpropane- 1, 3 -diols followed by their hydrolysis, {{led to the formation of}} acid acetals in good yield (~ 75 % after 2 steps). Rhodium (II) acetate is an efficient catalyst for the decomposition of diazoketones leading to transition metal-carbenoids (or metallocarbenes), reactive intermediates susceptible to insertion into a C-H bond. Determination of the optimum conditions for the C-H insertion process has been achieved and electronic effects of the substituents on the C-H insertion process have been examined. The reaction was regioselective, occurring at the C-H bond a to the oxygen, and a variety of bicyclic ketones were prepared in moderate but reproducible yields. The bicyclic core intermediate, present in naturally occurring bioactive molecules, is also a target for synthesis. An attempt to synthesize sordidin, an aggregation pheromone released by male <b>banana</b> <b>weevils,</b> is reported. Finally, the reductive cleavage of these bicyclic ketones, upon Et 3 SiH/Lewis Acid treatment, has been examined. In all cases, the reactions were stereoselective leading to 2, 3 -anti- 3, 5 -cis-trisubstituted tetrahydrofurans. The stereoselectivity increased with the size of the OR group at C- 3.

40|$|The {{context of}} this study is the {{pollution}} of soils and water by a persistent organo-chlorinated insecticide, chlordecone, in a tropical environment. The application of chlordecone to control the <b>banana</b> black <b>weevil</b> has led to continuing diffuse pollution of soils, and to its being a source of contamination for cultivated plants, as well as for terrestrial and marine ecosystems. Chlordecone is toxic and stable and {{is considered to be a}} persistent organic pesticide. Consequently, the amounts of chlordecone that could migrate through the environment and contaminate agricultural products need to be controlled. We measured the impact of two composts (5 % weight) on chlordecone sequestration in andosols. To this end, we first characterized the transfer of chlordecone from soil to water, and then its transfer from soil to plants. After 3 months of maturation, soil-water and soil-plant transfers were reduced by a factor of from 3 to 10. We also showed that adding compost to contaminated soils increases chlordecone sequestration because it leads to changes in soil microstructure in the form of pore collapse and closure of the fractal structure of the allophane content.

40|$|The <b>banana</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cosmopolites sordidus Germar, is an {{important}} pest of highland banana and plantain in Africa, but it exists in low densities in presumed area of origin in Southeast Asia such as in Indonesia. This suggests a possible existence of effective co-evolved natural enemies in the origin area of Indonesia, especially West Sumatra. The objectives of this study were: (1) to evaluate <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> pest status at selected sites in West Sumatra, (2) to survey parasitoids and predators, and (3) to determine the control potential {{of the most important}} natural enemies. Surveys were undertaken in March 2002 -August 2003 in five locations in West Sumatra, i. e., Bukittinggi, Sitiung, Pariaman, Pasaman, and Batusangkar. Five farms per site were selected randomly among all farms that contained banana stands of > 0. 5 ha. Sampling for <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> adults and damage, and for predators was done throughout small banana stands and within a 20 m x 40 m (0. 08 ha) subplot on larger farms. Field-collected larvae were taken to the laboratory and reared on corm pieces (3 cm x 3 cm x 3 cm) until pupation. Larvae were collected from pseudostem as well as corm residues. To estimate the abundance of non-social predators, i. e., those other than ants, 10 residues each on each farm were examined from plants that had been harvested 1 - 4 weeks, 5 - 8 weeks or 9 or more weeks before our visit to the site. Samples of the different morphospecies were saved in alcohol for later identification. The result showed that the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> incidence was found to be low,  0. 6 - 1. 7 adults per trap. Plant damage indices were below 2. 2 %. We collected and reared 24, 360 eggs and 3118 larvae, but no parasitism was detected. Phorids (Megaselia sp.) and drosophilids were recovered from larval rearings, but most likely were scavengers. A complex of predators was detected, the most important of which was the histerid beetles,  Plaesius javanus Erichson. In laboratory tests, adults and larvae of P.   javanus attacked 75 - 88 % and 38 - 53 % of <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> larvae and pupae, respectively. Predatory ants, including species of Myrmicinae, Ponerinae, Formicinae, and Dolichoderinae, were found to be associated with banana plants and residues.

40|$|Introduction. Chlordecone (CLD), an {{organochlorine}} formerly used {{to control}} the <b>banana</b> black <b>weevil,</b> is strongly adsorbed on soils, particularly on andosols. A simplified analytical procedure for the quantitative determination of chlordecone residues in water and micro-samples of soil and plants was compared with a standard method. Materials and methods. The procedure combines a simplified sampling protocol and a 10 -min solid phase microextraction (SPME), followed by gas chromatographic separation (GC) and mass spectrometric (MS and MS/MS) identification. Quantitation of CLD used a standard addition method with zero extrapolation. First, seventy samples were analysed using the proposed method and the standard method based on hot solvent extraction. Second, fifteen soil samples were analysed with two SPME methods followed by GC-MS but using CLD labelled with C 13 as an internal standard or the proposed method. Results and discussion. The detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ) limits of our SPME extraction procedure were determined for GC-MS and GC-MS/MS with water, plant (pineapple roots) and soil samples: in water for MS/MS, LODMS/MS-water = 0. 5 ng×L– 1, LOQMS/MS-water = 2. 0 ng×L– 1; in andosol for MS/MS, LODMS/MS-soil = 15. 0 ng×kg– 1 dw, LOQMS/MS-soil = 80. 0 ng×kg– 1 dw. Data from the seventy contaminated soils obtained with the proposed method and the standard method showed a correlation coefficient of r = 0. 86. Data obtained by the two SPME/GC-MS quantitation procedures showed a correlation of r = 0. 8073. Conclusion. The method proposes a simplified sample preparation and extraction of CLD in water, plant and soil samples, with no solvent manipulation and which is not time-consuming. The LOD and LOQ {{were similar to those}} obtained with other currently used methods. The method is reliable and accurate and may be considered as a good tool for research purposes.

The control of C. sordidus in intensive production systems is mainly based on application of insecticides; therefore the search for biological alternatives, {{such as the use}} of entomopathogenic nematodes (EPN), is needed. The susceptibility of Cosmopolites sordidus to Heterorhabditis atacamensis CIANE 07 was evaluated. The effect of inoculating H. atacamensis on larvae and adults of C. sordidus, in vitro and in artificially infected corms, was evaluated. Larvae inoculated with EPN had a mortality of 88 % on the second day and 100 % on the third day; no mortality was observed in adults. The treatments of 100, 500 and 1000 IJ. larvae- 1 showed statistically significant differences from the control and theLD 50 was 52 IJ. larvae- 1. When the larvae were placed within the corms the LD 50 increased to 375 IJ. larvae- 1.

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the European Commission, the Panel on Plant Health was asked to deliver a {{scientific}} opinion on 30 pest risk assessments made by France on organisms which are considered by France as harmful in four French overseas departments, i. e. French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion. In particular, the Panel was asked whether these organisms {{can be considered as}} harmful organisms for the endangered area of the above departments, in the meaning of the definition mentioned in Article 2. 1. (e) of Directive 2000 / 29 /EC and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. This document presents the opinion of the Panel on Plant Health on the simplified[2] pest risk assessment conducted by France on Odoiporus longicollis with French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion considered as endangered area. Odoiporus longicollis, the <b>banana</b> stem <b>weevil,</b> occurs in India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand where it is a key pest of bananas and plantains. The adult weevils are nocturnal, black-coloured, relatively large (23 - 39 mm), strong-flying beetles. All life stages are present throughout the year in the infested plant. Damage is caused by the larva tunneling inside the pseudostem of the banana plant, weakening the plant that is unable to bear the weight of the fruit. Up to 90 % yield loss can result. Control is by cultural methods and injecting pesticides into the stem. The Panel examined in detail the risk assessment provided, and considered the accuracy and quality of the information provided and methods applied for pest risk assessment purposes. The review was based on the principles of the International Standard on Phytosanitary Measures ISPM No. 11 [3]: Pest risk analysis for quarantine pests including analysis of environmental risks and living modified organisms (2004) by the International Plant Protection Convention (FAO, 2007 b). Although the pest risk assessment could be improved in the analysis of entry pathways and the analysis of economic, social and environmental consequences in case of establishment, the Panel agrees with the conclusion of the French document that :*the probability of entry of O. longicollis into the PRA area[4] is moderate. *O. longicollis has a very high probability of establishment and spread, due to the widespread distribution of its host plants, banana and plantain in the PRA area and*the impact of pest infestation on the host plant is high. Additionally, Musa spp. fruits are widely grown in the PRA area and are of particular economic importance as an export crop for Guadeloupe and Martinique. If the species became established in these two islands, export markets for banana could be seriously affected and additional control costs may reduce competitiveness. Smallholdings producing fruit for the local market or for home-consumption could suffer yield losses impacting on production and consumption patterns, with related negative social impacts, should the yield of plantain be substantially reduced. Similar effects are possible for French Guiana, where banana is also grown in shifting cultivation. Uncertainties exist concerning the importance of different possible entry pathways, some biological features of the pest, and the potential for social and environmental consequences, but these are not expected to affect the conclusions reached by the Panel. The Panel concludes that O. longicollis is appropriate for evaluation of pest risk management options for the endangered areas of French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Martinique and Réunion and thus potentially eligible for addition to the list of harmful organisms in Directive 2000 / 29 /EC...|$|R

40|$|Damage {{caused by}} plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} on East Africa Highland banana cultivar Mbwazirume was evaluated at Sendusu, Central Uganda. Banana plots were either nematode-infested or non-infested and received either continuous heavy mulch or were finger millet (Eleusine coracana) inter-cropped. An infestation with <b>banana</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cosmopolites sordidus, occurred naturally. Suckers detached from third crop cycle harvested plants were indexed for root and corm damage. Nematodes were {{extracted from the}} indexed roots. <b>Banana</b> <b>weevil</b> damage was observed in a cross-section through the corm of the harvested plant. Relationships between root damage, corm damage and nematode population densities were examined using correlation analyses. Path {{analysis was used to}} establish their relative effects on bunch weight. Independent of the type of crop management, percentage root necrosis, percentage dead roots, Radopholus similis and Helicotylenchus multicinctus population densities were each negatively correlated with bunch weight. <b>Banana</b> <b>weevil</b> damage and Pratylenchus goodeyi population densities were not correlated with bunch weight (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05). Path analysis revealed that root necrosis under heavy mulching and dead roots under finger millet inter-crop were the major factors associated with reduced bunch weight. Independent of the type of crop management, path analysis demonstrated that R. similis and then H. multicinctus contributed most, and to a lesser extent P. goodeyi, to root necrosis and dead roots.

40|$|Understanding how the {{population}} dynamics of insect pests {{are affected by}} environmental factors and agricultural practices is important for pest management. To investigate how the abundance of the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cosmopolites sordidus (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), is related to environmental factors {{and the length of}} the fallow period in Martinique, we developed an extensive data set (18, 130 observations of weevil abundance obtained with pheromone traps plus associated environmental data) and analysed it with generalized mixed-effects models. At the island scale, C. sordidus abundance was positively related to mean temperature and negatively related to mean rainfall but was not related to soil type. The number of insects trapped was highest during the driest months of the year. Abundance of C. sordidus decreased as the duration of the preceding fallow period increased. The latter finding is inconsistent with the view that fallow-generated decomposing banana tissue is an important resource for larvae that leads to an increase in the pest population. The results are consistent with the view that fallows, in association with pheromone traps, are effective for the control of the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Endophytic Fusarium oxysporum strains inoculated into tissue culture banana plantlets have shown {{control of the}} <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> and the nematode. We conducted screenhouse and field experiments to investigate persistence in the roots and rhizome of two endophytic Fusarium oxysporum strains, V 2 w 2 and III 4 w 1, inoculated into tissue-culture banana plantlets of highland cooking banana cultivars Kibuzi and Nabusa. Re-isolation of F. oxysporum showed that endophyte colonization decreased faster from the rhizomes than from the roots of inoculated plants, both in the screenhouse and in the field. Whereas rhizome colonization by F. oxysporum decreased in the screenhouse (4 – 16 weeks after inoculation), root colonization did not. However, in the field (17 – 33 weeks after inoculation), a decrease was observed in both rhizome and root colonization. The results show a better persistence in the roots than rhizomes of endophytic F. oxysporum strains V 2 w 2 and III 4 w 1. Bundesministerium für Wirtschaftliche ZusammenarbeitPeer Revie...|$|E
40|$|Field-scale plant {{diversification}} of agroecosystems is a promising way to enhance ecological pest regulation. Existing studies, however, have provided inconsistent results and have generally focused on {{only a few}} trophic groups or a few levels of plant diversification. Using field data from banana agroecosystems and structural equation modelling, we assessed (i) the effects of plant species richness (two height strata) and soil cover (% of living plant cover and% of litter cover) on a multitrophic arthropod food web, (ii) the links among five trophic groups of arthropods (detritivores, herbivores, non-ant omnivores, omnivorous ants, and predators) and (iii) the effect of natural enemies on the abundance and the damage of the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil,</b> Cosmopolites sordidus. Plant species richness of low strata (< 1. 5 m high) had a positive bottom-up effect on herbivore prey abundance, which in turn enhanced the abundance of non-ant omnivores and of predators. Litter cover promoted the abundance of detritivore prey, which in turn enhanced predators and omnivorous ants. The latter two trophic groups were negatively related to weevil damage and probably reduced damage by consuming weevil eggs and larvae. Finally, {{on the basis of}} our results, we suggest how the plant community and soil cover within the field could be managed to enhance ecological regulation of the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil.</b> (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Cysteine {{protease}} inhibitors (cystatins) {{are expressed}} in plants in response to wounding and insect herbivory and they form part of the native host-plant defence system. Cysteine proteases are enzymes important in the break down of dietary proteins mainly in the mid gut of coleopteran insects such as the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil.</b> The inhibition of these proteases has a direct effect on the digestive activity of the insect resulting in protein deficiency. This significantly affects insect development and survival. Based on these observations, strategies have been designed involving expression of cysteine protease inhibitors for the transgenic control of insect pests of several crop plants. For this study, {{it was hypothesized that}} the major proteases in <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> are cysteine proteases and can be effectively targeted by plant cystatins. It was further hypothesised that since plant cystatins are defense related, certain amino acid residues may have undergone positive selection. This provides an opportunity to increase their inhibitory potential to the weevil gut proteases via protein engineering. To prove the hypotheses, both in-vitro and in-vivo assays were set up thus allowing us to demonstrate the presence of cysteine type proteases <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> as well as the effect of cystatins on the weevil proteases and early development. Initial in-vitro experiments were able to characterize the proteolytic activity of the <b>banana</b> <b>weevil</b> gut proteases, which are mostly of the cysteine type, and in particular cathepsin B and L like. Two recombinant phytocystatins were further successfully produced using a 6 xHis-tagged affinity chromatogephy system in Escherichia coli bacteria. The recombinant phytocystatins were used in a newly developed vacuum infiltration assay system using banana stems. Young weevil larvae were allowed to develop on phytocystatin-treated stems for up to 10 days. They had a 60 % reduction in body weight and rate of growth compared to those that grew in untreated stems. By carrying out sitedirected mutagenesis to improve the inhibition efficiency of a model papaya cystatin, more than 8 amino acid residues were found to be subjected to positive selection. Mutation of amino acids yielded improved the inhibition potential of papaya cystatin against the model cysteine protease papain. Increased inhibition was greatest when amino acids were changed in the highly variable regions of the amino acid sequence very closely to the conserved regions. This study has been able to show {{for the first time that}} banana weevils use cysteine protease as major protein hydrolysis enzymes and that these can be effectively targeted by plant cystatins. It has also created novel phytocystatins using engineering of single amino acid sites following an evolutionary approach to modulate them for improved activity and targeting specific proteases.
