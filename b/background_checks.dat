However, the number of DHS <b>background</b> <b>check</b> programs has raised concerns that such workers may be subject to redundant <b>background</b> <b>check</b> programs. The Security and Accountability for Every Port Act of 2006 required GAO to conduct a study of those DHS <b>background</b> <b>check</b> programs similar to the one required of truck drivers to obtain a hazardous material endorsement (HME). For this study, GAO examined DHS <b>background</b> <b>check</b> programs to identify (1) potential redundancies and inconsistencies, if any, connected with these programs, and (2) actions, if any, DHS is taking or planning to coordinate its <b>background</b> <b>check</b> programs. To address these objectives, GAO examined selected <b>background</b> <b>check</b> programs, interviewed DHS officials and private stakeholders, and reviewed relevant documents. ...|$|R

40|$|Current {{federal law}} defies logic in {{requiring}} that only purchasers who buy from federally licensed sellers {{be subject to}} <b>background</b> <b>checking.</b> Thus, universal <b>background</b> <b>checking</b> is frequently proposed as {{the best and most}} important form of “sensible gun control”. Upon closer inspection, however, universal <b>background</b> <b>checking</b> would be harder to implement and enforce than proponents recognize. Moreover, the likely payoff in reduction of gun homicides, crimes and suicides would be less than what is often assumed. This Article closely examines universal <b>background</b> <b>checking</b> in theory and practice, including the Manchin-Toomey Amendment which Congress rejected in 2013 but which continues to be reintroduced...|$|R

For example, the city of Albuquerque, New Mexico require all volunteers to pass a <b>background</b> <b>check,</b> while the city of Austin, Texas {{does not require a}} <b>background</b> <b>check</b> to take part in training classes but requires members to undergo a <b>background</b> <b>check</b> in order to receive a CERT badge and directly assist first reponders during an activation of the Emergency Operations Center in Austin. However, most programs do not require a criminal <b>background</b> <b>check</b> in order to participate.|$|R

This requirement is in contrast to sales by gun stores and other Federal Firearms License (FFL) holders who are required to record all sales and perform <b>background</b> <b>checks</b> on almost all buyers, regardless of whether the venue is their business location or a gun show. Access to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) is limited to FFL holders and FFLs are not issued to persons that only sell firearms at gun shows.|$|E

40|$|This report {{takes a look}} at {{the state}} of the <b>background</b> <b>check</b> system in the wake of the most lethal gun crime in American history [...] one with direct {{relevance}} to the troubles with the <b>background</b> <b>check</b> system. An illegal buyer, Seung-Hui Cho, was able to pass a <b>background</b> <b>check</b> because his data was missing from the system. He purchased two firearms which he used to kill 32 people and wound 29 others at Virginia Tech University. In this report, we conclude that the <b>background</b> <b>check</b> system is better and more accurate than five years ago, but still deeply flawed, particularly in certain areas like mental health disqualifications. Dangerous holes in the system remain because states have not adequately completed the important tasks of collecting and automating all of the records necessary to disqualify illegal gun buyers from passing a check to obtain a firearm. On the positive side, the records of those who have committed felony crimes or have directed violence toward women have shown significant improvement. On the negative side, it is still virtually impossible to stop a person who has been involuntarily committed to a mental institution from passing a <b>background</b> <b>check</b> and buying a gun...|$|R

5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as the Brady bill loophole, the Brady law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers of firearms require records and or <b>background</b> <b>checks,</b> such as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, as long as the sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E

The funding for each candidate's official campaign was supplied entirely by the party centre.
