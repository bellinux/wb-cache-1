After writing his second book, The <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Tree,</b> in 1999, Rapp was invited {{to be the first}} author in residence at Ridgewood High School. The <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Tree</b> was censored by the Muhlenberg School Board in Reading, Pennsylvania due to its themes, graphic language and sexual content.

50|$|Camponotus compressus is {{a species}} of ant found in India and Southeast Asia. It is a {{frequent}} visitor to toilets as it consumes urea. It {{is one of the}} many species which tends plant-sap-sucking insects like aphids and <b>tree</b> <b>hoppers.</b> These ants stroke their antenna on the hind parts of these insects stimulating them to excrete a sugar rich liquid, called honeydew, which the ants consume. In return, they are known to protect the insects from predators like ladybugs.|$|R
25|$|In {{species such}} as the Coleopteran family Lampyridae, the males fly in the {{darkness}} and emit a species-species specific pattern of light flashes, which are answered by perching receptive females. The color and temporal variation of the flash {{contribute to the success}} in attracting females. Acoustic signals are produced by many groups including several orthopeteran species, neuropterida, cicadas, flies, cave planthroppers, leaf <b>hoppers,</b> and <b>tree</b> <b>hoppers.</b> In crickets and other Orthopeterans, loudness and/or uninterrupted songs often attract more females. In other insects, females may choose a mate in relation to aspects of his songs. In any case, it is possible that females compare the songs of several males before making a choice.|$|R
40|$|Members of {{the family}} Membracidae, the <b>tree</b> <b>hoppers,</b> are easily {{recognised}} by the greatly enlarged pronotum, which always extends beyond the scutellum and is prolonged backwards over the abdomen. The portion above the thorax is often grotesquely elevated with spine-, wedge- and horn-like processes, and in some species there are posterior elevated processes. There are 55 species of Membracidae in Australia (Woodward, Evans and Eastop 1970). It was believed that the family was not present in New Zealand (Evans 1966; Eyles 1970); certain]y, no endemic species have been collected. In May, however, a population apparently of the Australian species Acanthucus trispinifer (Fairmaire 1846) {{was found on the}} West Coast, abundant on broom and Cotoneaster...|$|R

40|$|A field {{investigation}} on the seasonal incidence of frequently occurring leaf eating pests of mulberry {{was carried out}} for two annual cycles from Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state. The present survey was conducted during June 2009 to May 2011. The result shows that, different pests are damaging the Mulberry cop from the study area which causes heavy economical loss to sericulture farmers. The pests occurred were leaf roller, Bihar hairy caterpillar, cutworms, Red hairy caterpillar, Jassid / leaf hopper, Southern green stink bug / Pentatomid bug, <b>Tree</b> <b>hoppers,</b> Litchi bug, wasp moth and wingless grasshopper etc. In the present study classification, occurrence and type of damage and symptoms of the defoliator insect communities was also worked out in the mulberry field from various sites in Aurangabad district of Maharashtra state, India...|$|R
2500|$|S. E. Hinton's The Outsiders (1967) and Paul Zindel's The Pigman (1968) are problem novels written {{specifically}} for teenagers. However, Sheila Egoff notes in Thursday's Child: Trends and Patterns in Contemporary Children's Literature that the Newbery Award winning novel It's Like This, Cat (1964) by Emily Cheney Neville may have established [...] "the problem novel formula." [...] Go Ask Alice (1971) {{is an early}} example of the subgenre and is often considered {{an example of the}} negative aspects of the form (Although the author is [...] "Anonymous", it is largely or wholly the work of its purported editor, Beatrice Sparks). A more recent example is Adam Rapp's The <b>Buffalo</b> <b>Tree,</b> 1997.|$|R
40|$|Mimicry {{complexes}} typically {{consist of}} multiple species that deter predators using similar anti-predatory signals. Mimics in these complexes {{are assumed to}} vary in their level of defence from highly defended through to moderately defended, or not defended at all. Here, we report a new multi-order mimicry complex that includes at least 140 different putative mimics from four arthropod orders including ants, wasps, bugs, <b>tree</b> <b>hoppers</b> and spiders. All members of this mimicry complex are characterised by a conspicuous golden body and an ant Gestalt, but vary substantially in their defensive traits. However, they were similarly effective at deterring predators - even mildly defended mimics were rarely eaten by a community of invertebrate and vertebrate predators both in the wild and during staged trials. We propose that despite the predominance of less defended mimics the three predatory guilds avoid the mimics because of the additive influence of the various defensive traits. 25 page(s...|$|R
40|$|We {{conducted}} a survey of insects and pest management practices on 34 farms growing ornamental tropical foliage plants in the central coffee region of Colombia over two years. Tropical foliage provided habitat for a diverse range of insects. In total, phytophagous or detritivorous insects from six orders, 40 families and 62 genera were collected. The most common were Hemiptera (29 genera from 16 families), followed by Coleoptera (17 genera from 4 families), Diptera (5 genera from 5 families), Lepidoptera (5 genera from 4 families), Hymenoptera (3 genera from 2 families) and Orthoptera (2 genera from 2 families). The most common phytophagous species were leaf cutting ants (Atta and Acromyrmex spp.), leaf beetles (Chrysomelidae), leafhoppers (Cicadellidae), stinkbugs (Pentatomidae), squash bugs (Coreidae), <b>tree</b> <b>hoppers</b> (Membracidae) and plant hoppers (Fulgoridae). Beneficial insects identified from tropical foliage included predators and parasitoids amongst 5 orders, 12 families and 22 genera. The most abundant were predators among the Coccinellidae, Chrysopidae, Reduviidae, Lycidae and Formicidae but only low numbers of parasitoids (Ichneumonidae, Braconidae and Tachinidae) were collected. A pest management questionnaire given to growers revealed a preponderance of reliance on broad spectrum insecticides with {{a smaller number of}} growers (approximately one third) also using some biological control methods. Our survey contributes basic information regarding diversity of Neotropical insects associated with ornamental foliage plants...|$|R
50|$|The Kickapoo kinship {{system is}} based on patrilineal clans, by which {{inheritance}} and property are passed through the paternal line. Children are considered born into the father's clan. There are 14 of the original 17 clans remaining: Man, Berry, Thunder, <b>Buffalo</b> #1, <b>Tree,</b> Black Bear, Eagle, Brown Bear, Buffalo #2, Fire, Water, Raccoon, and Fox. Marriage possibilities are based on affection; however, the clan system regulates the possibilities of each individual.|$|R
5000|$|Primary grasses in the Narus Valley are {{the shorter}} red oat grass and taller bunchy Guinea grass and fine thatching grass.Common {{trees in the}} drier areas are red thorn acacias, desert dates, {{and to a lesser}} extent {{drumstick}} trees. The iconic sausage trees and fan palms line the water courses. Euphorbia candelabrum and the shorter monkey bread (or camel's foot) and <b>Buffalo</b> thorn <b>trees</b> are also found. Perennial water makes River Kidepo an oasis in the semi-desert which hosts over 86 mammal species including spotted hyenas, Congo lions, Tanzanian cheetahs, leopards, wild dogs, elephants, giraffes, zebras, Cape buffaloes, bat-eared foxes, Rothschild's giraffes [...] - [...] as well as almost 500 bird species.|$|R

The radioactive cloud from <b>Buffalo</b> 1 (One <b>Tree)</b> reached a height of , exceeding the predicted , and radioactivity was detected in South Australia, Northern Territory, New South Wales, and Queensland. All four Buffalo tests were criticised by the 1985 McClelland Royal Commission, which concluded that they were fired under inappropriate conditions.|$|R
50|$|Mature {{trees have}} dark gray fissured bark. An adult tree reaches {{an average of}} 4 to 6 metres in height, though {{occasionally}} trees reach 25 metres. The foliage is dense and dark green with elliptical leaves, which are often eaten by grazing animals such as elephants and <b>buffalo.</b> The <b>tree</b> flowers in the rainy season; the flowers are imperfect, with genders on separate trees, and are cream-colored. The female tree bears fruit in the dry season and these are eaten by many wild animals; they are oval-shaped, yellow and about 20-30mm in diameter. When the fruits ripen they turn purple. The tree, like Marula, is favoured by the Bantu, who will leave them growing in their cultivated lands in order to harvest the fruit.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Queen Elizabeth National Park {{is home to}} {{the tree}} {{climbing}} lions. Lions do not normally climb trees, except when chased by another lion group or wild <b>buffalo.</b> However the <b>tree</b> climbing lions found in QE-NP intentionally climb trees and rest on them in the afternoon, when the sun is high. This is a truly unique phenomenon. There have only been rare similar sightings of this in Lake Manyara National Park of Tanzania.|$|R

50|$|Bourgmont {{wrote that}} the Padouca {{maintained}} permanent villages. They sent out regular hunting parties, in groups of 50-100 households. As one hunting party returned, another would leave, so that the village was occupied at all times. They journeyed up to {{five or six days}} travel from their village to hunt. The Padouca sowed corn and pumpkins. They obtained tobacco and horses from trade with the Spanish in New Mexico in exchange for tanned buffalo skins. The explorer noticed that some of the Apache still used flint knives for skinning <b>buffalo</b> and felling <b>trees,</b> an indicator that not much European trade had reached them.|$|R

Kalki Krishnamurthy made fun of it in Ananda Vikatan by claiming <b>buffaloes</b> and palm <b>trees</b> had acted well in the movie. He wrote the number one actor in the film was the coconut tree, number two was the buffalo and number three, the kid goat. The Tamil news paper Dina Mani also gave it a bad review.

5000|$|Snyder {{is named}} for {{merchant}} and buffalo hunter William Henry (Pete) Snyder, who built a trading post on Deep Creek in 1878. It soon drew fellow hunters and a small settlement grew up around the post. The nature of those early dwellings, mostly constructed of <b>buffalo</b> hide and <b>tree</b> branches, led to the communities first, if unofficial, name of [...] "Hide Town". Another early name, [...] "Robber's Roost" [...] is said to owe its beginnings to the sometimes nefarious nature of a few residents {{and a lack of}} law enforcement. A statue of an albino buffalo {{on the grounds of the}} Scurry County courthouse in Snyder pays homage to the town's beginnings as a buffalo trading post.|$|R
50|$|In their {{creation}} myth, {{the world was}} created by two rival deities, the First Creator and the Lone Man. The Missouri River divided the two worlds that the beings created. First Creator created the lands {{to the south of}} the river with hills, valleys, <b>trees,</b> <b>buffalo,</b> pronghorn antelope and snakes. To the north of the river, Lone Man created the Great Plains, domesticated animals, birds, fish and humans. The first humans lived underground near a large lake. Some of the more adventurous humans climbed a grapevine to the surface and discovered the two worlds. After returning underground, they shared their findings and decided to return with many others. As they were climbing the grapevine, it broke and half the Mandan were left underground.|$|R
50|$|De Smet {{wrote an}} early {{description}} of the Potawatomi settlement, which captures his bias:"Imagine {{a great number of}} cabins and tents, made of the bark of <b>trees,</b> <b>buffalo</b> skins, coarse cloth, rushes and sods, all of a mournful and funeral aspect, of all sizes and shapes, some supported by one pole, others having six, and with the covering stretched in all the different styles imaginable, and all scattered here and there in the greatest confusion, and you will have an Indian village."As more native Americans were pushed into the Council Bluffs area by pressure of European-American settlement to the east, inter-tribal conflict increased, fueled by the illegal whiskey trade. The US Army built Fort Croghan in 1842, to keep order and try to control liquor traffic on the Missouri River. However that fort was destroyed in a flood the same year.|$|R

At Chaska, at Granite Falls, I stepped off, but did not succeed in finding employment. It is probable that being filled with the desire of exploration I only half-heartedly sought for work; at any rate, on the third day, I found myself far out upon the unbroken plain where only the hairlike <b>buffalo</b> grass grew--beyond <b>trees,</b> beyond the plow, but not beyond settlement, for here {{at the end of my}} third day's ride at Millbank, I found a hamlet six months old, and the flock of shining yellow pine shanties strewn upon the sod, gave me an illogical delight, but then I was twenty-one--and it was sunset in the Land of the Dakotas! ...|$|R
5000|$|Course and {{programs}} at Trees For Tomorrow take place from September through May. Groups range from 30 to 90 students, elementary school {{through high school}} age, and their teachers.

The Apache sowed a little corn and pumpkins. They obtained tobacco and horses from trade with the Spanish in New Mexico, in exchange for tanned buffalo skins. It is unclear whether the Spanish ventured out on the plains to visit the Apache villages, or whether the Apaches traveled to the Spanish settlements. The latter seems more likely, although Spaniards may have gone out occasionally to meet the Apache who lived relatively near to their settlements. The explorer noticed that the Apache living furthest from the Spanish settlements still used flint knives for skinning <b>buffalo</b> and felling <b>trees,</b> an indicator that not much European trade had reached them.|$|R
40|$|Aim: To study {{changes in}} woody {{vegetation}} in both floodplains and eucalypt savanna over a 40 -year period using multi-temporal spatial analysis {{of variation in}} density of a large introduced herbivore, the Asian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis). Feral buffalo built up to high densities {{in the study area}} until c. 1985, after which a control programme almost eliminated the animals. From 1990, low densities of managed buffalo were maintained inside an enclosure. We compared trends in woody vegetation when buffalo were high-density feral, low-density managed or absent. Location: The study area was located in and around a 116 -km 2 buffalo enclosure inside Kakadu National Park, in monsoonal northern Australia. Methods: We analysed sequences of digitized and geo-rectified aerial photographs, acquired in 1964, 1975, 1984, 1991 and 2004, to chart changes in woody cover on the floodplain and in the savanna. On the floodplain we assessed whether trees were present at these times at 14, 568 points, and buffalo density was estimated from the density of animal tracks. In the savanna we estimated woody cover at pre-selected sites. Generalized linear modelling was used to analyse changes in woody vegetation, using e levation and presence of woody vegetation in neighbouring points on the floodplain, and buffalo regime and initial woody cover in the savanna. Results: Changes in animal track density reflected park-wide historical estimates of <b>buffalo</b> numbers. <b>Tree</b> cover increased in both floodplain and savanna, but this was only weakly related to buffalo density. The best predictor of whether a floodplain cell converted from treeless to woody, or the converse, was the woodiness of neighbouring vegetation. There was slightly less thickening with high buffalo densities. In savanna, low densities of managed buffalo were weakly associated with increases in tree cover relative to either high densities of feral buffalo or no buffalo. Main conclusions: Our study indicates that buffalo are not a major driver of floodplain and eucalypt savanna dynamics. Rather, the observed increase in woody cover in both savanna and flood plains concords with regional trends and may be related to increased atmospheric CO 2, increasing rainfall and changing fire regimes during the study period. 13 page(s...|$|R
