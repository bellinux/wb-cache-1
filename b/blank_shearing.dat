40|$|An {{ultrasonic}} system using electromagnetic acoustic transducers {{has been developed}} at the Fraunhofer Institute for Non-Destructive Testing (IZFP), {{in order to test}} laser welds in tailored <b>blanks.</b> <b>Shear</b> horizontal modes are exploited to detect different types of defects in the laser welds, such as lack of penetration, lack of fusion, mismatch and cracks. In the present work, studies of the discontinuities of the laser weld that affect specularly reflected and non-specularly signals have been carried out on ferritic sheets. Geometric parameters of the laser weld, such as the fusion-zone width and the discontinuities at the weld root, were measured and compared with the amplitude of the reflected signals. Furthermore, X-ray radiographs and metallography were made to obtain additional information on the different defects, which affect the ultrasonic signal. From our results we conclude that under thickness and incomplete penetration at the root, together with the pores of the weld affect the reflected signal more than any other discontinuity...|$|R
40|$|The use of HSLA steels for the {{manufacture}} of automotive components is interesting from an engineering point of view. This family of steels, while possessing high strength, also has good formability {{and can be used}} in forming manufacturing processes. In some forming processes such as <b>blanking,</b> <b>shear</b> strain localization occurs, which causes damage and results in the final fracture of the material. This paper presents an experimental study based on in situ tests to understand and identify the physical mechanisms of ductile damage under two stress states: tension and shear. Different macroscopic tests were performed to calibrate a damage model based on a micromechanical approach. This damage model is based on the Gurson–Tvergaard–Needleman theory and presents recent improvements proposed by Nahshon and Hutchinson and by Nielsen and Tvergaard so as to better predict fracture under a wide range of stress states, especially with low levels of stress triaxiality. These extensions have made the identification of the material parameter more complicated. In this work an identification strategy has been proposed using tests on specimens with different shapes. The identified parameter values are validated and the fracture model show good predictive capability over a wide stress state range...|$|R

40|$|The {{capabilities}} of finite elements codes allow now accurate simulations of blanking processes when appropriate materials modelling are used. Over the last decade, numerous numerical {{studies have focused}} on the influence of process parameters such as punch-die clearance, tools geometry and friction on blanking force and <b>blank</b> profile (<b>sheared</b> edge). The proposed study focuses on the finite elements simulations of a blanking process using a new viscoplastic model for the evolution of the flow stress coupled with a new damage model. The commercial finite elements code ABAQUS/Explicit has been chosen to simulate the blanking process. The finite elements predictions have been compared with experimental results. Then the finite elements simulations have been used to assess the influence of punch-die clearance as well as the influence of tool wear and friction on sheared edge quality...|$|R

Out of <b>sheared</b> <b>blanks</b> specimens for an air bending test are conducted and subjected to a bending load under a systematic variation of process determining parameters. It is shown that especially {{the position of the}} fracture area caused by blanking in the bending area of tensile stresses leads to a significant increase of the edge crack sensitivity and thus has to be considered as an important interaction of the two processes. Also a strong influence of the material anisotropy on the occurring damage and failure is detected...|$|R

40|$|Sheet metal {{components}} are used extensively in various {{applications such as}} vehicles, aircraft, electronics products, medical implants and packaging for consuming goods, typical parts/components including car panels, aircraft skins, cans for food and drinks, frames for TV/computer screens/monitors/displays, etc. Basic process configurations for the forming of macro-products include <b>shearing,</b> <b>blanking,</b> bending, stamping, deep drawing (including mechanical and hydromechanical), hydroforming, stretching forming, super-plastic forming, age forming, spinning, explosive forming, and incremental forming. Some of these processes may be equally applied to the forming of miniature and even micro-products, if the issues related to “size effect” can be handled successfully. The manufacture of micro-sheet metal products, such as those used in electronics products and MEMS (micro-electric-mechanical systems), often needs bending to produce 3 D profiles/sections. Typical applications include micro-electric contacts/fingers/switches, 3 D profiles for mechanical and thermal-mechanical sensors and 3 Dsheet metal frames/housing for optical devices and micro-sensors...|$|R
40|$|We present {{laboratory}} ultrasonic {{measurements of}} shear-wave splitting from two synthetic silica cemented sandstones. The manufacturing process, which enabled silica cementation of quartz sand grains, {{was found to}} produce realistic sandstones of average porosity 29. 7 ± 0. 5 % and average permeability 29. 4 ± 11. 3 mD. One sample was made with a regular distribution of aligned, penny-shaped voids to simulate meso-scale fractures in reservoir rocks, while the other was left <b>blank.</b> Ultrasonic <b>shear</b> waves were measured with a propagation direction of 90 ° to the coincident bedding plane and fracture normal. In the water saturated blank sample, shear-wave splitting, the percentage velocity difference between the fast and slow shear waves, of < 0. 5 % was measured due to the bedding planes (or layering) introduced during sample preparation. In the fractured sample, shear-wave splitting (corrected for layering anisotropy) of 2. 72 ± 0. 58 % for water, 2. 80 ± 0. 58 % for air and 3. 21 ± 0. 58 % for glycerin saturation at a net pressure of 40 MPa was measured. Analysis of X-ray CT scan images {{was used to determine}} a fracture density of 0. 0298 ± 0. 077 in the fractured sample. This supports theoretical predictions that shear-wave splitting (SWS) {{can be used as a}} good estimate for fracture density in porous rocks (i. e., SWS = 100 ?f, where ?f is fracture density) regardless of pore fluid type, for wave propagation at 90 ° to the fracture normal...|$|R
40|$|Lien vers la version éditeur: [URL] audienceA new {{blanking}} {{process that}} involves punch speed up to 10 ms − 1 has obvious advantages in increased productivity. However, the inherent dynamics {{of such a}} process {{makes it difficult to}} develop a practical high speed punch press. The fracture phenomenon governing the blanking process has to be well understood to correctly design the machine support and the tooling. To observe this phenomenon at various controlled blanking speeds a specific experimental device has been developed. The goal is to measure accurately the <b>shear</b> <b>blanking</b> forces imposed on the specimen during blanking. In this paper a new method allowing the blanking forces to be measured and taking into account the proposed test configuration is explained. This technique has been used to determine the blanking forces experienced when forming C 40 steel and quantifies the effect of process parameters such as punch die clearance, punch speed, and sheet metal thickness on the blanking force evolution...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} current methods of {{producing}} tailored blanks (TBs), {{together with the}} areas of applications and possible problems. A new method of producing TBs, based on simple shear, has been proposed. It is {{a variant of the}} process, which originally has been developed as a means of refining grain structure of metals by Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP). Further development of ECAP towards an incremental version of this process (I-ECAP) enables processing very long billets and varying their thickness. Taking advantage of the latter, two different experimental rigs have been built in order to check feasibility of producing TBs by I-ECAP. TBs produced in this way have been named Tailored <b>Sheared</b> <b>Blanks</b> (TSBs). Finite element simulation of the process realised on one of these rigs provided an insight into the mechanism of changing blank thickness and strain distribution. The proposed method has several advantages such as lack of welding seams, possibility of thinning as well as thickening initial blanks, creation of thickness steps {{on both sides of the}} blank and flexible length of thickness transition...|$|R
