25|$|The Jamaican Government is {{discussing}} {{resumption of}} national railway services, initially with Canadian National Railway and then Rail India Technical and Economic Service (RITES); {{and now with}} the China Railways after a deal was signed by the Prime Minister P J Patterson with Chinese vice-president Zeng Qinghong in Jamaica in February 2005.

On 19 July, another torrential storm caused further wreckage in at least 45 separate locations as rain fell on the already saturated ground, and at least ten of these spots damage was so serious major engineering work was required before reconstruction could get under way. It was also said later that the crucial link between Hampton Loade and Arley, including Highley station and the new Engine House museum, would probably not open until as late as Spring 2008.|$|E
