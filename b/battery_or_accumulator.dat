Introduction: The first {{storage cell}} {{was invented in}} 1801 by M. Gautherot but not until 1881 was it used to any extent. There is record of the {{application}} of a storage battery in England in that year. The first battery installed in this country was at a central station in Phillipsburg, Pa., in 1885 while 1889 marks the beginning of the general application of the storage battery in the commercial world. The storage <b>battery</b> <b>or</b> <b>accumulator</b> consists of two inert plates of metal or some oxide of metal placed in an electrotype which is incapable of acting upon than chemically, until by the action of an electric current passed through the cell, the nature of the material on the plates is changed...|$|E
50|$|Even in 1880, however, {{but little}} headway {{had been made}} toward the general use of these illuminants; the rapid {{subsequent}} growth of this industry {{is a matter of}} general knowledge. The employment of storage batteries, which were originally termed secondary <b>batteries</b> <b>or</b> <b>accumulators,</b> began about 1879. Such batteries are now utilized on a large scale as auxiliaries to the dynamo machine in electric power-houses and substations, in electric automobiles and in immense numbers in automobile ignition and starting systems, also in fire alarm telegraphy and other signal systems.|$|R

DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An electrochemical component for storing and discharging electrical energy comprises at least two electrochemical cells (20 a, 20 b), each with a flat cathode, flat anode and flat separator and cathode and anode current collectors (connected to the cathode and anode respectively and each having a connecting tag (12 a, 12 b, 13 a, 13 b)). The novel feature is that the cells are relatively aligned with the tag (13 a) for the cathode of one cell (20 a) positioned relative to the tag (12 b) for the anode of an adjacent cell (20 b) {{in such a way}} that magnetic fields generated by moving electric charges in the tags overlap and compensate for each other. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for the production of the electrochemical components, by locating at least two flat primary or secondary cells (20 a, 20 b) adjacent to each other, with the connecting tags (12 a, 12 b, 13 a, 13 b) of one cells forming a four-pole arrangement. USE - The electrochemical components are generally in the form of <b>batteries</b> <b>or</b> <b>accumulators</b> of various sizes and shapes for all types of applications, specifically flat <b>batteries</b> <b>or</b> <b>accumulators</b> consisting of foil-like layers, especially lithium ion or lithium-polymer cells. They are particularly useful in magnetic field-sensitive applications, e. g. in devices for measuring disturbances in the earth's magnetic field (typically to detect archeological articles) or in magnetic field-sensitive sensors or location systems (typically for medicinal or military use). ADVANTAGE - Formation of stray magnetic fields is minimized, thus reducing or eliminating charge flow-sensitive magnetic field fluctuations having an adverse effect in magnetic field-sensitive applications...|$|R
50|$|The {{primary purpose}} of an {{aircraft}} APU is to provide power to start the main engines. Turbine engines must be accelerated to a high rotational speed to provide sufficient air compression for self-sustaining operation.

Any on-board accumulator is considered {{as an integral part}} of the vehicle’s accumulator.

5000|$|A {{rechargeable}} battery, storage <b>battery,</b> secondary cell, <b>or</b> <b>accumulator</b> {{is a type}} {{of electrical}} battery which can be charged, discharged into a load, and recharged many times, while a non-rechargeable <b>or</b> primary <b>battery</b> is supplied fully charged, and discarded once discharged. It is composed of one or more electrochemical cells. The term [...] "accumulator" [...] is used as it accumulates and stores energy through a reversible electrochemical reaction. Rechargeable batteries are produced in many different shapes and sizes, ranging from button cells to megawatt systems connected to stabilize an electrical distribution network. Several different combinations of electrode materials and electrolytes are used, including lead-acid, nickel cadmium (NiCd), nickel metal hydride (NiMH), lithium ion (Li-ion), and lithium ion polymer (Li-ion polymer).|$|R
40|$|Direct {{methanol}} {{fuel cells}} (DMFCs) are attractive for various applications, above all, however, as replacements for <b>batteries</b> <b>or</b> <b>accumulators.</b> They {{may be used}} in different power classes. A market analysis indicated that the use of a DMFC energy system in the kW class had the best chance of commercial realization if applied in forklift trucks for material handling in large distribution centers or warehouses. An advantage of such energy systems {{is that there is no}} need for the relatively time-consuming recharging of the lead-acid batteries, nor is it necessary to have spare batteries available for multishift operation. This calls for DMFC energy systems that are capable of replacing the existing Pb accumulators in terms of space requirements and energy. However, this requires considerable improvements to be made in terms of power and stability over time of DMFC systems and, in comparison to their present status, an increase of overall efficiency. Recent cost analyses for the overall system; for example, show that for the DMFC stack, a durability of at least 5000 h must be achieved with an overall efficiency for the DMFC system of at least 30 %, with the constraint that the system can be operated in a water-autonomous manner up to an ambient temperature of 35 degrees C. As part of a joint R&D project with industrial partners, two systems were constructed and each subjected to long-term testing for 3000 and more than 8000 h, respectively, with realistic load profiles from driving cycles. In this test, the stack from the first system, DMFC V 3. 3 - 1, displayed an aging rate of approximately 52 mu V h(- 1) at a current density of 100 mA cm(- 2). This corresponds to a performance degradation of 25 % over a period of 3, 000 h. The DMFC V 3. 3 - 2 system, a modified and optimized version of the first system, also underwent long-term testing. In this case, the aging rate of the stack was only approximately 9 mu V h(- 1) at a current density of 100 mA cm(- 2). The system has thus been operated to date for more than 8000 h under realistic load profiles. [DOI: 10. 1115 / 1. 4006490...|$|R

40|$|Renewable energies, {{and among}} them solar photovoltaics, are {{becoming}} {{more important in the}} last years {{due to the lack of}} fossil fuels and the environmental impact of them. PV installed capacity is increasing over and over in some countries and the prices of the installation are decreasing while the prices of the electricity are predicted to increase. Electricity use in buildings account for an important part of all electricity use in the world. This two facts make the PV installation in the rooftops of buildings a good opportunity to reduce the purchase of electricity from the grid.   The aim of the thesis is to analyze the profitability and the environmental impact (when using a hot water accumulator) of a PV system with different storage systems placed in the rooftop of two dwellings located in Gävle (Sweden). The storage systems can be either <b>batteries</b> <b>or</b> hot water <b>accumulators.</b> The purpose of the storage system is to increase the self-consumption rate of the PV system and to save the highest amount of money possible. It is also studied the difference of installing PbA and Li-ion batteries, and the reliability of the data used in the simulation of the alternative systems with the help of the software PVsyst.   Results show that the profitability of the proposed three alternative PV systems with storage is not higher than the PV system without storage. The reason for this has been found in the low prices of electricity and DH nowadays. Moreover, the impact of decreasing the heating demand from DH network does not benefit the environment, because the electricity has to be produced in power plants that produce more pollutants. It can be said also that the data obtained in PVsyst has been determined reliable and that the difference between the two types of batteries is not conclusive.   It can be concluded that if the cost of the PV systems <b>or</b> the <b>batteries</b> would decrease, the profitability will be higher. Furthermore, the increase in the price of electricity, DH or governmental subsidies would improve the results. ...|$|R
