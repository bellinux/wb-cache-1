5|$|A young Serb <b>boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> {{vicinity}} of Višegrad {{is taken from}} his mother by the Ottomans {{as part of the}} devşirme levy, one of many Christian boys to experience this fate during the Ottoman Empire's 500-year-long occupation of the Balkans. The boy's mother follows her son wailing until she reaches the Drina River, where he is taken across by ferry and she can no longer follow. The young boy is converted to Islam and assigned the Turkish name of Mehmed, becoming known as Mehmed-paša Sokolović. He rises through the Ottoman military ranks and around the age of 60 becomes the Grand Vizier, a position he holds for the next fifteen years. During his time as Grand Vizier, he serves under three sultans and oversees the Ottoman Empire's expansion into Central Europe. He remains haunted by the memory of being forcibly taken from his mother and orders the construction of a bridge at the part of the river where the two became separated.|$|E

Through a misunderstanding, the orphanage sends Anne instead.|$|E
25|$|It {{is thought}} that cricket was {{introduced}} to Slovenia in 1974, after Borut Čegovnik, then a 13-year-old <b>boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mountain town of Mežica, {{was introduced to the}} sport on an extended visit to his penpal in Birchington-on-Sea, Kent. He received extensive coaching from his host's father, and went back to his home with a selection of cricket equipment having decided that cricket was just the thing for his town. Seventeen, mainly single-wicket, tournaments were held between 1974 and 1982, with 24 local boys playing. The game was played in the village until 1982, when several of the ringleaders moved to the Slovenian capital, Ljubljana.|$|E
25|$|Hargreaves is {{well known}} as the gentle-voiced {{presenter}} of the weekly magazine programme Out of Town, first broadcast in 1960 following {{the success of his}} series Gone Fishing the previous year. Broadcast on Friday evenings on Southern Television the programme was also taken up by many of the other ITV regions, usually in a Sunday afternoon slot. He also presented three series (one of them with Ollie Kite) of Country Boy, a networked children's programme in which a <b>boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city was introduced to the ways of country. Other programmes he created for local viewers were Farm Progress and a live afternoon series Houseparty. His country TV programmes continued after the demise of Southern with Old Country for Channel 4.|$|E

25|$|In late 1974 Keays {{embarked}} on his ambitious concept LP, <b>Boy</b> <b>From</b> <b>The</b> Stars, which was premiered {{at the final}} Sunbury Pop Festival in January 1975, where his all-star backing group was joined by Wheatley, recently returned from the UK, in their last performance together for over ten years. Ironically, after ripoffs endured as The Masters Apprentices, Keays and his band were the only group at Sunbury who were paid—Keays had wisely arranged an outside sponsor—low attendance and the huge $60,000 fee paid to headliner Deep Purple meant {{that none of the}} other Australian acts were paid, and the festival organisers went into liquidation soon after. Keays continued his solo musical career, fronting Southern Cross, and from 2000 he has toured as a member of Cotton Keays & Morris with 1960s artists Darryl Cotton from Adelaide's Zoot and Russell Morris from Melbourne's Somebody's Image.|$|E
25|$|Giotto, (1266–1337), by {{tradition}} a shepherd <b>boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hills north of Florence, became Cimabue's apprentice and {{emerged as the}} most outstanding painter of his time. Giotto, possibly influenced by Pietro Cavallini and other Roman painters, did not base the figures he painted upon any painterly tradition, but upon the observation of life. Unlike those of his Byzantine contemporaries, Giotto's figures are solidly three-dimensional; they stand squarely on the ground, have discernible anatomy and are clothed in garments with weight and structure. But more than anything, what set Giotto's figures apart from those of his contemporaries are their emotions. In the faces of Giotto's figures are joy, rage, despair, shame, spite and love. The cycle of frescoes of the Life of Christ and the Life of the Virgin that he painted in the Scrovegni Chapel in Padua set a new standard for narrative pictures. His Ognissanti Madonna hangs in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence, {{in the same room}} as Cimabue's Santa Trinita Madonna and Duccio's Ruccellai Madonna where the stylistic comparisons between the three can easily be made. One of the features apparent in Giotto's work is his observation of naturalistic perspective. He is regarded as the herald of the Renaissance.|$|E

500|$|During {{its first}} years, the daily Winnie Winkle evolved from simple gags to more complex humorous situations. A new {{character}} {{was introduced in}} the form of Perry, a little <b>boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> backstreets, whom the Winkles adopted in 1922. The focus of the Sunday pages then shifted to the adventures of Perry at home, school and on the streets. Although compelled to wear a duffle coat and fancy clothes, he continued to frequent his old neighborhood. The local gang, the Rinkydinks, in contrast, still wore torn and patchy clothing, and were regarded by Winnie as [...] "loafers." [...] One member of the Rinkydinks was the dunce, Denny Dimwit, who popularized the catch phrase, [...] "Youse is a good boy, Denny." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1962, {{scientists}} at Los Alamos created a mockup of Little Boy known as [...] "Project Ichiban" [...] {{in order to}} answer some of the unanswered questions, but it failed to clear up all the issues. In 1982, Los Alamos created a replica Little <b>Boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original drawings and specifications. This was then tested with enriched uranium but in a safe configuration that would not cause a nuclear explosion. A hydraulic lift was used to move the projectile, and experiments were run to assess neutron emission. Based on this and the data from The Great Artiste, the yield was estimated at 16.6 ± 0.3 kilotons. After considering many estimation methods, a 1985 report concluded that the yield was 15 kilotons ± 20%.|$|E

500|$|In {{our time}} was {{published}} {{as part of}} Pound's modernist series by Three Mountains Press, Paris in 1924. The work was well received by critics; Edmund Wilson described the writing as [...] "of the first distinction", and in the 1940s he again wrote of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", [...] "along with the mottled trout... the <b>boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American Middle West fishes up a nice little masterpiece." [...] When the story {{was published in the}} United States, critics asserted Hemingway had reinvigorated the short story by his use of declarative sentences and his crisp style. [...] In 1952, reviewing The Old Man and the Sea—for which Hemingway would win the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Prize in Literature—The New York Times said of [...] "Big Two-Hearted River" [...] {{that it was one of}} the [...] "best and happiest of his early short stories".|$|E
500|$|The two {{managers}} have [...] "exchanged some of football's best and bitterest verbal swipes," [...] according to The Daily Telegraph. In 1997, Ferguson called Wenger a [...] "novice" [...] for {{complaining about the}} fixture programme and later said of his linguistic skills: [...] "They say he’s an intelligent man, right? Speaks five languages! I’ve got a 15-year-old <b>boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Ivory Coast who speaks five languages!" [...] After Arsenal's defeat to Manchester United in February 1997 – a match marred by a bust up between Wright and Schmeichel, Wenger referred to Ferguson’s interference: [...] "I {{was surprised to see}} Ferguson on the pitch because you can only play eleven." [...] When Ferguson asserted that his team played the best football in England during the 2001–02 season, Wenger quipped: [...] "Everyone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home," [...] a subtle remark that Ferguson initially suspected was a taunt at his own wife Cathy.|$|E
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from August 20, 1910. It states: [...] "May Merrill and Will Marshall are sweethearts and both reporters on the Daily Wave. Will leaves the paper to accept a position of private secretary to Blake, commissioner of public works. Shortly after Will takes up his new work Blake is threatened with exposure and punishment on his charge of accepting a bribe. In order to save himself, Blake makes it appear that Will is the guilty party. May is sent to investigate the matter for the Wave. When she discovers that Will is accused, she determines to devote all of her time to clearing him, and with this end in view, she applies for the vacant position of private secretary to Blake. Assisted by Pete, faithful office <b>boy</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Wave, who follows her to her new position, May does some clever detective work and, clearing Will, manages to fix the guilt where it belongs, {{on the shoulders of}} Blake." ...|$|E
