It was then succeeded by FMV, which was a backronym to mean For Maximum Value, originally meaning Fred Meyer Value. In early 2007, Kroger replaced FMV with the Kroger Value brand. The Kroger Value brand was phased out in 2014. It offers staple products such as sugar, flour, bread and canned goods at the lowest price for that particular product in the store.

40|$|Web pages {{consist of}} not only actual content, but also other ele-ments such as <b>branding</b> <b>banners,</b> navigational elements, advertise-ments, {{copyright}} etc. This noisy content is typically {{not related to the}} main subjects of the webpages. Identifying the part of ac-tual content, or clipping web pages, has many applications, such as high quality web printing, e-reading on mobile devices and data mining. Although there are many existing methods attempting to address this task, most of them can either work only on certain types of Web pages, e. g. article pages, or has to develop differ-ent models for different websites. We formulate the actual content identifying problem as a DOM tree node selection problem. We develop multiple features by utilizing the DOM tree node proper-ties to train a machine learning model. Then candidate nodes are selected based on the learning model. Based on the observation that the actual content is usually located in a spatially continuous block, we develop a grouping technology to further filter out noisy data and pick missing data for the candidate nodes. We conduct ex-tensive experiments on a real dataset and demonstrate our solution has high quality outputs and outperforms several baseline methods...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Web {{pages are}} often {{decorated}} with extraneous information (such as navigation bars, <b>branding</b> <b>banners,</b> JavaScript and advertisements). This {{kind of information}} may distract users from actual content they are really interested in and may reduce effects of many advanced web applications. Automatic content extraction has many applications ranging from providing data for web mining to realizing better accessing the web over mobile devices. In this paper, we propose ContentEx, a framework for automatic content extraction programs, which we use to organize codes of automatic content extraction programs and to facilitate the development of related solutions. We also introduce how we extract content from forum pages in this framework to fulfill the requirement from our actual application. is got based on heuristic rules designed in these algorithms. Web pages are so different that distinct methods {{may be needed to}} get ideal results. So how to organize and reuse related codes is a new problem we encounter. In this paper, we propose ContentEx, a framework for automatic content extraction programs, which we use to solve the new problem. And we expect that the framework and pre-defined modules implemented in this framework can facilitate the development of other related solutions. The method we use to extract content from forum pages is also discussed in this paper. Experimental results show that the method can fulfill our requirement.

40|$|Online {{marketing}} and advertising instruments—and {{the ways in}} which consumers react to them—are always evolving, which results in ongoing gaps in knowledge. This dissertation aims to fill some of these gaps by providing a greater understanding of how the Internet impacts online {{marketing and}} advertising research. The first study in this dissertation describes how banner exposure characteristics, such as the number of exposures, spacing, and delay, impact consumer memory. The findings of this study underline the importance of banner memory as <b>banner</b> exposure affects <b>brand</b> memory indirectly through banner memory. The findings also imply that massed banner scheduling is less effective than continuous banner scheduling strategy. The second study extends the first study through a comprehensive model that links banner memory and attitude to brand memory and attitude—and ultimately to purchase intention—to determine the interrelationships among banner effect variables. This study finds that despite the distinct features of it medium, banner advertising effect works similar to the hierarchy-of-effect in traditional media advertising. However, there are two notable differences: the advertising–brand memory relationship is stronger but the banner attitude–brand memory is weaker in banner advertising than in traditional media advertising. Finally, the third study investigates whether companies can use online polls for marketing research purposes. This study finds that differences in results from online polls and from traditional surveys come from sample effects and not from the survey mode. This finding implies that simple online polls have the potential to serve as market research instruments for specific, well-targeted populations...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Asian Educational Media Service (AEMS) is {{a unit of}} the Center of East Asian and Pacific Studies at the University of Illinois. AEMS helps {{educators}} find multimedia {{resources for}} teaching about Asia in order to promote understanding of Asian cultures and peoples. AEMS offers curriculum units, audio-visual components and lesson plans as well as workshops and an annual film festival. Objective: The client needed a web <b>banner</b> to visually <b>brand</b> a new media resources web site. Since the branding process always starts with a logo, we Convinced the client to develop the logo first. Once the logo was approved, then we moved on to design the look-and-feel of their web site. For us, designing a web 2 ̆ 2 banner 2 ̆ 2 was too restrictive, so we presented full web page mock-ups that took into account typography, navigation, color, negative space and how they interacted with the new logo. Solution: The client wanted 2 ̆ 2 presentation quality 2 ̆ 2 proposals, so each concept was drawn up as finished art in Adobe Illustrator, then refined as needed. Each of these designs conveyed movement and action, which is the essence of motion pictures and digital media. Since Asia is a large and diverse geographic region, we deliberately avoided using traditional Asian visual symbols since they would be too culture-specific. Once a black-and-white concept was approved, we started exploring color palettes. The final design successfully communicates the integration of various images into one unified whole and works well with the existing AEMS logo. [URL]...|$|R
