Taylor performed strongly in the ODIs, {{with a total of}} 302 runs at 60.40. However, it was a disappointing tour for the team; the solitary Test in Delhi was lost, as were all five ODIs played during the Titan Cup.|$|E
500|$|... io9 {{felt the}} {{character}} of Danes to be a cross between Freddy Krueger and Jesus. Commenting on the Christ comparison, Pullman felt that his character {{was sort of the}} [...] "doppelganger of Jesus or something." [...] He stated of Danes: [...] "It's like he's <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desert, and he comes back in, and there is a certain kind of way in which he still has pride." [...] SFX described Oswald's journey as one from a Hannibal Lecter type character to a Billy Graham or messianic figure. Pullman observed that Oswald's failure to die [...] "becomes the pivot for a whole world that has changed"; feeling that his character was an intelligent one who knows he can provide a message people want to hear. Discussing Oswald's fall from grace, series writer Jane Espenson explains that [...] "humanity doesn't seize on heroes for the long–term", and that Oswald's descent from fame was a way to make his arc more realistic. Though Oswald dies helping the Torchwood team, Espenson remarked that [...] "we didn't want to outright redeem this horrible, horrible man" [...] commenting that his death is intended as [...] "redemption and comeuppance both." [...] The Independents Neela Debnath observed that whilst {{the character of}} Danes had [...] "become likeable in an odd-sort of way" [...] his last scenes [...] "reiterated just how despicable he was" [...] and that it was the right time for him to depart the cast.|$|E
2500|$|In {{early to}} mid-July July 1800 [...] Scourge, which had <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> West Indies since 13 April 1997, {{returned}} to Great Britain {{as part of}} the escort of the about 91 sail of the West India fleet. On 20 August, she passed up the Bristol Channel with 11 vessels out of a convoy of 41 vessels that [...] was taking to the Thames, the rest of the vessels being destined for Liverpool and Glasgow. Scourge arrived at Portsmouth two days later.|$|E

2500|$|Suárez {{returned}} from his ban on 6 February against Tottenham Hotspur in the Premier League, coming on as a substitute in a 0–0 draw at Anfield; Dalglish reacted to his return by saying [...] "It's fantastic to have him back. He should never have <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first place". Ahead of the 11 February game between United and Liverpool at Old Trafford, the Premier League stated that the formal pre-match handshake would go ahead, Ferguson stated that he thought Evra should shake Suárez's hand, while Dalglish stated that Suárez would too. However, during the traditional pre-game handshakes, Suárez appeared to avoid Evra's hand, leading to Evra grabbing Suárez's arm. Suárez ignored Evra and continued down the line causing Evra to throw his arms up in protest and Rio Ferdinand to also avoid shaking Suárez's hand. Despite Liverpool ordering Suárez {{not to talk about}} the racial abuse incident, Suárez continued to discuss it. In May 2012, Suárez called his suspension [...] "strange and unbelievable" [...] and said that there was [...] "not a single convincing proof that [...] had done any of the things they accused [...] of doing"; he also denied that he had refused to shake Evra's hand. In 2014, Suárez released his autobiography Crossing the Line, in which he continued to deny the verdict that he had racially abused Evra, stating [...] "what some people will never want to accept is that the argument took place in Spanish. I did not use the word [...] "negro" [...] the way it can be used in English", despite admitting that the word [...] "negro" [...] means [...] "black". He also complained about the after-effects, saying the verdict that he was a racist would be [...] "a stain on my character that will probably be there forever".|$|E
2500|$|Ian Redpath (21) and Rick McCosker (35) {{upset the}} England plans by adding 52 in 83 {{minutes for the}} first wicket. Geoff Arnold made the ball cut and lift immediately, but Bob Willis {{struggled}} and after six overs Derek Underwood replaced Arnold, who changed ends so as to {{have the advantage of}} the wind behind him. [...] "Deadly Derek" [...] (7/113) was called an umbrella bowler – there in case of a rain-affected wicket – {{and he was able to}} make the ball leap and turn from his first over. The openers managed to survive, and by surviving most of the first session they ensured that the Australian middle order would be able to play on a less lethal wicket. Denness failed to bring on Fred Titmus at the other end until the last over before lunch in conditions tailor made for spin bowling, a decision for which he was greatly criticised though E.W. Swanton thought the damps patches were not on Titmus's length. As it was Underwood had to do all the work, bowling 29 overs compared to 31 by the other five bowlers. He achieved the breakthrough when McCosker clipped a ball to Cowdrey in the slips, then both Chappell brothers, Ian was surprised by a leaping ball and skyed it to Knott, while Greg was lbw to a ball that turned from leg to middle stump while he tried to run a leg-bye. With the last ball before lunch Redpath edged the ball the Greig at silly-point and Australia were 77/4. After lunch Marsh tried to hit Underwood out of the attack, but was taken by Greig at mid-wicket at 84/5 with the Kent bowler having taken all the wickets 5/35. The South Australian sun was now drying out the wicket, which reverted to its normal, placid self in the afternoon. The brilliant Doug Walters hit 55 off 66 balls with 7 fours and a six, adding 80 with Terry Jenner who made his only Test fifty on his home ground. Titmus replaced Underwood just as the pitch was losing its turn and Walters was getting into his stride. The Australian batsmen took 24 runs off two overs and Walters's six was caught one handed in the member's stand. The tired Underwood was brought back as his left arm spin could not be hit so easily and Walters spooned a catch to a surprised Willis at mid-off. The tall Max Walker had yet to fail in the series and hit 41, adding 77 with Jenner until the latter became Underwood's seventh successive wicket when he misjudged the flight and hit over a ball. Walker hit what looked like an easy two only to end up at the same end as Lillee while Denness threw down the stumps after a fine pick up. Lillee walked to keep Walker in until Amiss insisted that Walker was the man to go and the umpire agreed. Lillee (26) added 36 with Mallett (23 not out) and hooked Willis for four until the new ball was taken. Willis then spread Lillee's stumps and Arnold those of Thomson and Australia were out for 304, the mystery being why they had not <b>been</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> morning such a poor wicket.|$|E
