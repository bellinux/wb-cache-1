50|$|On February 24, {{the rebels}} seized a convoy with ammunition, money and supplies, near the National Bridge. But they were {{defeated}} on March 3 {{by the forces}} of general Jose Maria Calderon and Jose Antonio Facio; Santa Anna escaped to Veracruz. Thereafter, he decided to hunker down in the <b>bulwarks</b> <b>port</b> and Fort San Juan de Ulua. His strategy worked to mid-May. Jos√© Maria Calderon had to lift the siege of Veracruz because his army had been decimated by rain, heat, mosquitoes and disease.|$|R
60|$|There, as of old, {{we find a}} huge, white-painted troop-ship warping slowly in, her <b>bulwarks</b> and <b>ports</b> {{crowded with}} white helmets, and eager faces gazing at the equally eager but anxious faces on shore.|$|R
60|$|Finally, towards evening, Captain Blood {{went over}} the side and was rowed back to his great ship with her red <b>bulwarks</b> and gilded <b>ports,</b> touched into a lovely thing of flame by the setting sun.|$|R
60|$|I {{respected}} the motive, though the manifestation was absurd. 'Stop, you'll bite your thumb off,' I said, and Keller laughed brokenly {{as he picked}} up his cigar. Only Zuyland, leaning over the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks,</b> seemed self-possessed. He declared later that he was very sick.|$|R
60|$|During {{this brief}} but thrilling period, the {{brothers}} Vandervell and Benjy Vane crouched close together beside the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks,</b> partially screened from the falling ice by the mizzen shrouds. The Captain {{stood on the}} quarter-deck, quite exposed, and apparently unconscious of danger, the picture of despair.|$|R
60|$|Had {{the ship}} been taken, then? But that was impossible, for {{there were the}} pirates {{clustering}} in swarms along the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks,</b> and waving their hats joyously in the air. Most prominent {{of all was the}} renegade mate, standing on the foc'sle head, and gesticulating wildly. Craddock looked over the side to see what they were cheering at, and then in a flash he saw how critical was the moment.|$|R
60|$|Jack, {{being one}} of the watch on deck, went to the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks</b> near the {{foremast}} shrouds, leant over, and, gazing down into the reflected sky, thought sadly of past, present, and future. Tiring at last of his meditations, he went towards a man who appeared to be skulking under the shadow of the long-boat and remarked that it was a fine night, but the man made no reply.|$|R
50|$|New London {{spent the}} ensuing days patrolling the Mississippi between Donaldsonville and New Orleans. On {{the morning of}} 7 July 1863, Southern forces opened fire on the ship with {{artillery}} and musketry {{when she was about}} ten miles below Donaldsonville. A shell smashed through the <b>bulwarks</b> on her <b>port</b> quarter wounding Read in his abdomen and his right knee. He was taken to a hospital at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he died on the evening of the next day.|$|R
60|$|The Margaret was a swift ship, {{but never}} yet had she moved so swiftly. Behind her shrilled the gale, {{for now it}} was no less. Her stout masts bent like fishing poles, her rigging creaked and groaned beneath {{the weight of the}} bellying canvas, her <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks</b> slipped along almost level with the water, so that Peter must lie down on the deck, for stand he could not, and watch it running by within three feet of him.|$|R
60|$|But the {{examination}} of the after part of the vessel yielded no fruit. As we have said, that part was sunk deeply, so that only the cabin skylight was above water, and, although they both gazed intently down through the water with which the cabin was filled, they could see nothing whatever. With a boat-hook which they found jammed in the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks,</b> they poked and groped about for a considerable time, but hooked nothing, and were finally obliged to return empty-handed to the anxious Pauline.|$|R
50|$|The Danes {{removed the}} crew of the Seagull, {{including}} the dead and wounded, and sent damage control parties aboard. However, Seagull had more than five feet of water in her hull and sank suddenly, drowning several Danes. Still, Seagull had sunk in the relatively shallow waters of Fosseholmen Bay some five miles south-west of Kristiansand, with her <b>port</b> <b>bulwark</b> remaining above the water. The Danes were able later to raise and refit her for service with the Dano-Norwegian Navy. She was commissioned under 1st. Lieutenant O. Kr. Budde.|$|R
60|$|The galleys drew {{up right}} across her path. Half {{a mile away}} they lay bow by bow, knowing well that no ship could pass the foaming shallows; lay bow by bow, waiting to board and cut down this little English crew when the Margaret {{shortened}} sail, as shorten sail she must. Smith yelled an order to the mate, and presently, red in the setting sun, out burst the flag of England upon the mainmast top, a sight at which the sailors cheered. He shouted another order, and up ran the last jib, so that now {{from time to time}} the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks</b> dipped beneath the sea, and Peter felt salt water stinging his sore back.|$|R
60|$|A {{fortnight}} {{later the}} Cerf passed along under easy sail between {{the island of}} Margarita and the mainland. She was now getting {{very close to the}} spot where, if the prisoner was right, the pirates' hold lay. The Stars and Stripes was hanging from the peak, and with her high <b>bulwarks</b> and ten <b>ports</b> on each side no one would have suspected that she was not, as she seemed, an American man-of-war, heavily armed. Passing close to another island, they headed more south into the bay as they neared Caracas. Every foot of the islands was closely scanned. Five miles farther, they came abreast of the Chimana isles, and pointing to one of these that lay nearer the shore than the others, the prisoner exclaimed that he was certain that that was the island.|$|R
6000|$|JOHNSON--Yes, sir. [He goes. The door {{is closed}} again. MAT BURKE stumbles {{in around the}} port side of the cabin. He moves slowly, feeling his way uncertainly, keeping hold of the <b>port</b> <b>bulwark</b> {{with his right hand}} to steady himself. He is {{stripped}} to the waist, has on nothing but a pair of dirty dungaree pants. He is a powerful, broad-chested six-footer, his face handsome in a hard, rough, bold, defiant way. He is about thirty, in the full power of his heavy-muscled, immense strength. His dark eyes are bloodshot and wild from sleeplessness. The muscles of his arms and shoulders are lumped in knots and bunches, the veins of his forearms stand out like blue cords. He finds his way to the coil of hawser and sits down on it facing the cabin, his back bowed, head in his hands, in an attitude of spent weariness.] ...|$|R
60|$|Before {{that point}} was reached, a roll {{diverted}} him out of course and he was brought up by the main hatch, from which he rebounded like a billiard ball towards the starboard gangway. At this point he lost his balance, and went rolling to leeward like an empty cask. There was something particularly awful and impressive {{in the sight of}} this unwieldy monster being thus knocked about like a pea in a rattle, and sometimes getting into attitudes that would have been worthy of a dancer on the tightrope, but the consummation of the event was not far off. An unusually violent roll of the ship sent him scrambling to starboard; a still more vicious roll checked and reversed the rush and dashed him against the cabin skylight. He carried away part of this, continued his career, went tail-foremost through the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks</b> like a cannon-shot into the sea. He rose once, but, as if to make sure of her victory, the ship relentlessly fell on him with a weight that must have split his skull, and sent him finally to the bottom.|$|R
60|$|With {{most of his}} men {{crouching}} {{behind his}} <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks,</b> and others protected by deck houses, smokestack, and any other available devices against gunshots, Captain Horn awaited {{the coming of the}} pirate steamer, which was steaming towards him as if it intended to run him down. As she came near, the Vittorio slowed up, and the Monterey veered to starboard; but, notwithstanding this precaution {{and the fact that they}} sailed side by side for nearly a minute without touching, the two vessels came together with such force that the Monterey, high out of water, rolled over as if a great wave had struck her. As she rolled back, grappling-irons were thrown over her rail, and cables and lines were made fast to every available place which could be reached by eager hands and active arms. Some of the grappling-irons were immediately thrown off by the crew of the Monterey, but the chains of others had been so tightened as the vessel rolled back to an even keel that it was impossible to move them.|$|R
60|$|This {{being done}} he could pass under {{the lines of}} the other divers, and {{examined}} the wreck as far as the bow, where he found an immense hole, partially filled by a mass of the rock which had originally driven it in. This of itself was sufficient to have sunk the vessel. In order to examine the port side of the wreck he returned towards the stern and signalled for more air. As before, he rose to the bulwarks, over which he passed by a slight effort, and, opening the valves, dropt gently, like a bird, upon the deck. Walking across it slowly, and with some difficulty, owing to the broken spars and cordage with which it was encumbered, he passed over the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks</b> and lowered himself again to the bottom. A careful examination showed him that no injury worth mentioning had been sustained on that side, and he finally {{came to the conclusion that}} the large hole in the starboard bow was the only serious damage done to the hull.|$|R
6000|$|The {{last words}} died on Keller's lips, his eyes began {{to start from}} his head, and his jaw fell. Some six or seven feet above the <b>port</b> <b>bulwarks,</b> framed in fog, and as utterly {{unsupported}} as the full moon, hung a Face. It was not human, and it certainly was not animal, for it {{did not belong to}} this earth as known to man. The mouth was open, revealing a ridiculously tiny tongue--as absurd as the tongue of an elephant; there were tense wrinkles of white skin at the angles of the drawn lips, white feelers like those of a barbel sprung from the lower jaw, and {{there was no sign of}} teeth within the mouth. But the horror of the face lay in the eyes, for those were sightless--white, in sockets as white as scraped bone, and blind. Yet for all this the face, wrinkled as the mask of a lion is drawn in Assyrian sculpture, was alive with rage and terror. One long white feeler touched our bulwarks. Then the face disappeared with the swiftness of a blindworm popping into its burrow, and the next thing that I remember is my own voice in my own ears, saying gravely to the mainmast, 'But the air-bladder ought to have been forced out of its mouth, you know.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"The {{engineer}} {{stayed on}} deck {{while the men}} went down below. The skipper hadn't {{got back to the}} chart-room before I saw thirty feet of bowsprit hanging over the break of the fo'c'sle. Thirty feet of bowsprit, sir, doesn't belong to anything that sails the seas except a sailing-ship or a man-of-war. I speculated quite a long time, with my hands on the bulwarks, as to whether our friend was soft wood or steel plated. It would not have made much difference to us, anyway; but I felt there was more honour in being rammed, you know. Then I knew all about it. It was a ram. We opened out. I am not exaggerating--we opened out, sir, like a cardboard box. The other ship cut us two-thirds through, a little behind the break of the fo'c'sle. Our decks split up lengthways. The mizzen-mast bounded out of its place, and we heeled over. Then the other ship blew a fog-horn. I remember thinking, as I took water from the <b>port</b> <b>bulwark,</b> that this was rather ostentatious after she had done all the mischief. After that, I was {{a mile and a half}} under sea, trying to go to sleep as hard as I could. Some one caught hold of my hair, and waked me up. I was hanging to what was left of one of our boats under the lee of a large English ironclad. There were two men with me; the three of us began to yell. A man on the ship sings out, 'Can you climb on board if we throw you a rope?' They weren't going to let down a fine new man-of-war's boat to pick up three half-drowned rats. We accepted the invitation. We climbed--I, the engineer, and the ship's boy. About half an hour later the fog cleared entirely; except for the half of the boat away in the offing, there was neither stick nor string on the sea to show that the Hespa had been cut down." ...|$|R
