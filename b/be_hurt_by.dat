5|$|On August 15, 2007, Donaghy {{pleaded guilty}} to two federal charges related to the investigation, {{and a year later}} he was sentenced to 15 months in prison and three years of {{supervised}} release. As a result, the general reaction by the media was that the NBA's popularity would <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the news of this scandal.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after the}} reports were released, several writers {{said that the}} NBA's {{popularity}} would <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the news. Chris Sheridan of ESPN said that [...] "the general American public has been turning away {{since the end of}} the Bulls' dynasty, and this fiasco isn't going to help bring it back", and J. A. Adande said that [...] "the integrity of the games just took a major hit".|$|E
500|$|Mora death raised {{fears that}} the country's economy would <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> reduced tourism, leading Univision to {{describe}} the situation as [...] "an internal crisis". [...] Commentary published by the Costa Rican Times alleged that the true culprits would never be found, saying whoever was blamed would be a scapegoat offered up by the drug traffickers. [...] The government [...] "is happy letting the Caribbean side of Costa Rica lose all tourism" [...] continued the commentary by Dan Stevens. [...] "Maybe the group Sea Turtle Conservation with Guns should be formed to fight back." [...] An editorial published by the Tico Times asked why it took a murder to get the government to act. [...] "Mora reached out for help before he was killed, and no one came to the rescue, no matter what political spin is put on it", said the author. [...] Mora's death, suggested the author, shows that [...] "the drug traffickers are winning", that crime {{is out of control}} in Limón, and that [...] "the bad guys operate with near impunity." [...] The editorial concluded by imploring Costa Ricans to re-evaluate their personal environmental habits and support environmental groups that keep fighting. [...] The Guápiles Biofestival, an arts festival held each year during early June, was also dedicated to Mora.|$|E

2500|$|Giuliani's voter appeal {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the previous month's {{stories about his}} personal and business life, {{as well as the}} reduced level of civil strife in Iraq undercutting his security-based campaign messages. [...] When the close proximity of the first contests to the holidays led to many candidates putting out Christmas videos — allowing them to keep presenting their message but in a more appropriate setting — Giuliani chose two videos which combined his policy goals with humorous asides with Santa Claus regarding fruit cakes as gifts or the vain hope that [...] "all the presidential candidates can just get along." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Tezuka, the {{prototype}} initially {{was not a}} side-scrolling game, and the player controlled a 16 by 32 pixel square. Tezuka only suggested the use of Mario after seeing the sales figures of Mario Bros., which was still selling well throughout the previous year since its release. The prototype was based around a shooting mechanic with very different controls. The sky-based bonus stages are a remnant of a level design where Mario jumped onto a cloud and fired at enemies. [...] They changed the game's focus to jumping action and they thus remapped the A button from shooting to jumping. After releasing Mario Bros., the team had reflected {{that it had been}} an illogical gameplay decision for Mario to <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> stomping upon the walking turtles, so they decided any future Mario game would [...] "definitely have it so that you could jump on turtles all you want." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2009 the Bloomberg {{administration}} {{attempted a}} different policy for replacing the taxicab fleet with hybrid or other low-emission vehicles. The Taxi and Limousine Commission enacted {{a set of}} incentives to allow taxi fleet owners to charge drivers more to drive hybrid or clean diesel cabs, and penalize fleet owners by lowering the amount they could charge to lease cabs that use more fuel and pollute more. The city argued that drivers would not <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the higher hybrid leasing fees because those cars use less gasoline. This approach was also blocked after some taxi groups sued and obtained a preliminary court injunction. In July 2010 the city's appeal was rejected by a federal appeals court. The court upheld the initial ruling {{on the grounds that}} [...] "the city's rules amounted to an effort to mandate fuel economy and emissions standards, something that only the federal government is allowed to do." [...] On February 28, 2011, the United States Supreme Court declined to consider an appeal by the city.|$|E
2500|$|Strong winds {{have caused}} lake {{currents}} to shift sediment on the bottom, leading to [...] "wickedly shifting sandbars" [...] {{which have been}} a source of shipwrecks. But winds can have a peaceful purpose as well; there have been proposals to place electricity–producing wind turbines in windy and shallow points in the lake and along the coast, both in the United States and Canada. In 2010, there were plans for GE to develop five wind turbines to generate 20 megawatts of power by 2012 with plans to generate 1,000 megawatts by 2020; one proposal called for [...] "gearless turbines" [...] with 176-foot long blades helped along with magnets. A nonprofit development group near Cleveland was developing plans to construct hundreds of turbines in the lake. [...] A former steel mill site on {{the eastern edge of the}} lake in Buffalo, NY has been redeveloped as an urban wind farm in 2007. Known as Steel Winds, the project currently houses 14 turbines capable of generating up to 35 megawatts of electricity. [...] A plan by Samsung to build an offshore wind farm on the north shore of the lake, from Port Maitland to Nanticoke for a distance of , but the plan has been met with opposition from residents for a number of reasons. Canadians near Leamington and Kingsville have organized protest groups to thwart attempts to bring wind turbines to the lake; reasons against the turbines include spoiling lake views as well as possible adverse effects regarding drinking water and commercial fishing. Plans to install turbines in Pigeon Bay, south of Leamington were met with opposition as well. The notion that bird and bat migration may <b>be</b> <b>hurt</b> <b>by</b> the wind turbines has been used to argue against the wind turbines; a reporter in The Globe and Mail wrote [...] "Given the tendency of turbines to make mincemeat of things airborne, it doesn’t require great imagination to figure out what would happen." ...|$|E
