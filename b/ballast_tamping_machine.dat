The two main contents are concerned in this paper. The first is to research the modeling method of ballast particles in the software EDEM. The second is to establish a rigid-flexible coupling dynamic model of railway <b>ballast</b> <b>tamping</b> system, and according to this model, the dynamic response of the granular particles under tamping load is calculated. From a numerical simulation, we can find the effect of ballastâ€™s vibration characteristic is related to the shape of particles in significant measure.

40|$|Abstract: The article {{deals with}} the {{conception}} of carrying out investigation work on lateral resistance {{in the course of}} geometrical railway track alignment by using a <b>tamping</b> <b>machine.</b> It is a continuation of the experimental work on the application of the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> to the continuous welded rail track diagnosis. In earlier articles, attention was concentrated on the determination of axial forces in rails. An analytical approach to the evaluation of lateral resis-tances based on a continuous registration of the displacement and the force used by the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> for the displacement of track on a horizontal plane (so-called slewing or shifting) is presented. The obtained results offer a possibility of estimating a phenomenon tested taking into consideration the state of the track ballast (the layer of crushed rock or gravel upon which the railway track is laid) bed stabilization, the distribution of the lateral resistances occurring along the length of railway track sections under tests, and also the effect of the longitudinal forces appear in track sections. The performed experiments have confirmed the thesis about the use of the <b>tamping</b> <b>machine</b> to diagnose the lateral resistance state in railway tracks. Some trends towards further undertakings in this sphere, of development character intended to polish up the measuring system, and the way of archiving and interpreting the measuring results have been formulated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Railway <b>ballast</b> <b>tamping</b> {{operations}} is employed {{in order to}} restore the geometry of railway track distorted by train traffics. The main goal is to compact the stone ballast under the sleepers supporting the railway squeezing and vibrations. The ballast compactness is the most direct index for evaluating the effect of tamping operation. This paper presents an experimental method used to detect the railway ballast compactness before and after tamping operation based on water-filling method, and creates a discrete element analysis model of railway ballast which analyzes the change of ballast compactness before and after tamping operation based on discrete element method. The simulation results are very similar with experimental results, which verify that the discrete element method is an effective method to evaluate the change of railway <b>ballast</b> compactness during <b>tamping</b> process...|$|R
5000|$|There {{are still}} {{a large number of}} sugar cane tramways built to a common [...] gauge, and sharing {{research}} and development into advanced features such as concrete sleepers, <b>tamping</b> <b>machines,</b> remotely controlled brake vans, and the like. There is little through traffic with main line railways so that the break-of-gauge is not a problem.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{machines}} only {{lifted the}} track and packed the ballast. More modern machines, sometimes known as a tamper-liner or <b>tamping</b> and lining <b>machine,</b> also correct the alignment of the rails to make them parallel and level, {{in order to achieve}} a more comfortable ride for passengers and freight and to reduce the mechanical strain applied to the rails by passing trains. This is done by finding places where the sleepers have sunk from the weight of the passing trains or frost action, causing the track to sag. The tamper lifts each sleeper and the rails up, and packs ballast underneath. When the sleeper is laid down again, the sagged rails now sit at the proper level. In cases where frost action has caused adjacent rails to rise higher, ballast tampers can raise rails above their original level to make the line level again. [...] "Lining" [...] rails doesn't involve <b>ballast</b> <b>tamping,</b> it merely ensures the rails are perfectly parallel and straight as possible. Combining tamping and lining into a single machine saves time and money, as only one machine needs to be run over the track to perform both functions.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] 31 railway {{workers and}} 32 lumberjacks were {{examined}} {{to compare the}} dose-response relation between the exposure to two types of hand-arm vibration and the sensory disturbances in peripheral nerves as evaluated by the vibration perception thresholds (VPTs). METHODS [...] Clinical examinations were carried out that included measurements of the VPTs, and electroneuromyography (ENMG), and an inquiry to confirm the use of vibrating tools. Diseases of {{the central nervous system}} and neuropathies were checked by inquiry and a clinical examination, diabetes was excluded by a blood sample analysis, and the subjects with carpal tunnel syndrome confirmed with ENMG were excluded from the study. RESULTS [...] Lifetime use of hand held <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> (railway workers) and chain saws (lumberjacks) had a significant correlation with the VPTs at frequencies from 32 to 500 Hz. The increase of the VPTs (250 Hz) in relation to use of vibrating tools was 1. 8 -fold higher on average in the whole group and 2. 3 -fold higher in the young (< 45) railway workers who had used hand held <b>tamping</b> <b>machines,</b> than in the corresponding groups of lumberjacks, who had used chain saws, whereas the frequency weighted acceleration of vibration in <b>tamping</b> <b>machines</b> was fourfold. CONCLUSION [...] There was a significant dose-response relation between the exposure to hand-arm vibration and the VPTs. The VPTs {{as a function of the}} frequency weighted acceleration of vibration and the exposure to vibration gave promising results for assessment of the risk of damage to sensory nerves induced by vibration...|$|R
40|$|Under-sleeper pads (USPs), {{typically}} {{made from}} polyurethane, {{are used by}} railways {{in certain parts of}} the world to reduce ballast settlement and consequently lengthen the <b>ballast</b> <b>tamping</b> cycle. The rationale behind this relatively new addition to the conventional ballasted track structure is that the pad increases the contact area between the angular ballast particles and the underside of the concrete sleeper, with the effect that ballast breakdown and total track settlement are reduced. This paper describes two experiments on the effects of USPs on four aspects of sleeperâ€“ballast interaction, namely contact area, contact pressure, ballast settlement and ballast breakdown. Static and dynamic tests up to 1 million loading cycles were performed under controlled laboratory conditions on concrete sleepers with and without USPs. Sophisticated pressure sensors revealed an increase in contact area from 12 % to 35 % for static loading tests, and from 8 % to 20 % for dynamic tests, with a resulting 70 % reduction in contact pressure. In addition, a 44 % reduction in ballast settlement and a 23 % reduction in ballast breakdown were achieved by the introduction of USPs. In conclusion it is argued that the introduction of USPs specifically on heavy-haul lines would offer significant advantages with respect to ballast settlement and breakdown. These advantages are most likely to lengthen general <b>ballast</b> <b>tamping</b> and screening cycles, resulting in significant life cycle cost savings.

In this paper, the model for the novel routine maintenance scheduling problem (RMSP) in a railway track network is presented.

Different variants of the simulated annealing approach, different methods to produce an initial solution and different approaches to generate a neighbourhood solution, are designed, implemented and compared...|$|R

40|$|The {{dimensioning}} of the {{locking device}} of a switch is made essentially {{as a function}} of the applied loads during the switch rails movement or considering a false route. The phenomena related to the vibrations induced by the track are therefore normally not taken into account. Such vibrations are particularly accentuated by the ballast bed deconsolidation in the sleeper panel supporting the locking device. Unfortunately, there is no specific technical reference in order to control these aspects, even though the most frequent cause of locking device components failures is relied to the vertical oscillations induced by the trains, rather than to the effort to commute the switch rails. In this study, the results of a field investigation carried out at two levels of <b>ballast</b> <b>tamping</b> are reported and discussed.
