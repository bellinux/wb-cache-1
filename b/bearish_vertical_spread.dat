50|$|The Russian {{military}} has established accuracy standards that the SVD and its corresponding sniper grade ammunition have to meet. Manufacturers must perform firing tests to check if the rifles and sniper grade ammunition fulfill these standards. To comply to the standards, the SVD rifle with 7N1 sniper cartridges may not produce more than 1.24 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> with 240 mm twist rate barrels {{and no more}} than 1.04 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> with 320 mm twist rate barrels. When using standard grade 57-N-323S cartridges, the accuracy of the SVD is reduced to 2.21 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread.</b> The extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spreads</b> for the SVD are established by shooting 5-shot groups at 300 m range. The accuracy requirements demanded of the SVD with sniper grade ammunition are similar to the American M24 Sniper Weapon System with M118SB cartridges (1.18 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread)</b> and the M110 Semi-Automatic Sniper System with M118LR ammunition (1.27 MOA extreme <b>vertical</b> <b>spread).</b>|$|R
50|$|A Ratio spread is a complex, multileg options {{position}} {{that is a}} variation of a <b>vertical</b> <b>spread.</b> Like a <b>vertical,</b> the ratio <b>spread</b> involves buying and selling options on the same underlying security with different strike prices and the same expiration date.

An unequal number of options contracts gives this spread certain unique properties compared to a regular <b>vertical</b> <b>spread.</b> A typical ratio spread would be where twice as much option contracts are sold, thus forming a 1:2 ratio.|$|R

Host specialization of IS-group isolates of Heterobasidion annosum to Scots pine, Norway spruce and common fir in field inoculation experiments. Two field inoculation experiments {{were conducted to}} study intraspecific variation in <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> of the P-, S- and F-IS-group isolates of Heterobasidion annosum in stems of Pinus sylvestris, Picea abies and Abies alba. Host-plants were inoculated with four isolates of each IS group after 10 mm long wounds made with a sterile knife (experiment 1) or 3 mm diameter radial holes made with a drill (experiment 2). On pine, the P-group isolates were more virulent than S and F isolates in terms of infection frequency, mortality rate and <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> in sapwood. The S isolates had higher incidence of infection and extensive growth on spruce than on pine. The F isolates were significantly less virulent on pine and spruce than on fir. <b>Vertical</b> <b>spread</b> of all IS groups on fir was similar. In spite of between-strain-within-IS group variation in <b>vertical</b> <b>spread</b> on each host, the study provided strong evidence for the occurrence of intraspecific differences in the host preference. In the interspecific analysis with three hosts, the isolates, IS groups and host × strain and host × IS group inter-actions accounted {{for most of the}} explained variation, while host-plants accounted for the smallest portion of the variance.
