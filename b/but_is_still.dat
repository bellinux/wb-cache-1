5|$|Bethlehem {{now has a}} Muslim majority, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> home to a {{significant}} Palestinian Christian community. Bethlehem's chief economic sector is tourism, which peaks during the Christmas season when Christians make pilgrimage to the Church of the Nativity, as they have done for almost 2,000 years. Bethlehem has over 30 hotels and 300 handicraft workshops. Rachel's Tomb, an important Jewish holy site, {{is located at the}} northern entrance of Bethlehem.|$|E

5|$|Broaching {{works best}} on softer materials, such as brass, bronze, copper alloys, aluminium, graphite, hard rubbers, wood, composites, and plastic. However, {{it still has}} a good {{machinability}} rating on mild steels and free machining steels. When broaching, the machinability rating {{is closely related to}} the hardness of the material. For steels the ideal hardness range is between 16 and 24 Rockwell C (HRC); a hardness greater than HRC 35 will dull the broach quickly. Broaching is more difficult on harder materials, stainless steel and titanium, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> possible.|$|E
5|$|Bélé are {{folk songs}} of West African origin, {{traditionally}} performed recreationally {{in the evening}} during the full moon, and more rarely, lavèyé (wakes). The bélé tradition has declined in the 20th and 21st century, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> performed for holidays like Easter, Independence Day, Christmas, Creole Day (Jounen Kwéyòl) and patron saint festivals held annually in the Parishes of Dominica, especially in the Fèt St.-Pierre and the Fèt St.-Isidore for fishermen and workers respectively.|$|E
5|$|Cubzac's {{climate is}} oceanic, {{part of the}} Dfb group in the Köppen climate classification. Periodically, the river Dordogne causes flooding. Nowadays Cubzac is {{protected}} by a dam, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> vulnerable to flooding during high tides and strong winds. Flooding occurred last in the 1999 Martin and 2010 Xynthia storms. The 1999 storm destroyed many trees from the Terrefort castle park. In 1708, a temperature extremum of -15°C caused the river and vineyards to freeze.|$|E

5|$|The Central American {{squirrel}} monkey is arboreal and diurnal, and most often {{moves through the}} trees on four legs (quadrupedal locomotion). It lives in groups containing several adult males, adult females and juveniles. The group size tends to be smaller than that of South American {{squirrel monkey}}s, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> larger than for many other New World monkey species. The group generally numbers between 20 and 75 monkeys, {{with a mean of}} 41 monkeys. Groups in excess of 100 sometimes occur, but these are believed to be temporary mergers of two groups. On average, groups contain about 60% more females than males.|$|E
5|$|The nearby 19th century house, Stonelands also formed {{part of the}} estate, so Repton {{ensured that}} it would be visible from the parkland. Stonelands no longer forms part of the estate, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> visible from the park and wood. Towards the end of the 19th century, the house's park land was open to the public on certain days of the week by Peter Arthur Marsham Hoare, however this {{practice}} had ended by 1902. The grounds were still regularly opened for events such as fetes, the Dawlish flower show, as well as opening the gardens to the public.|$|E

5|$|As time passes, Woodroof shows {{compassion}} towards gay, lesbian, and transgender {{members of}} the club and making money becomes less of a concern; his priority is provision of the drugs. Peptide T gets increasingly difficult to acquire, and in 1987 he files {{a lawsuit against the}} FDA. He seeks the legal right to take the protein, which has been confirmed as non-toxic <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> not approved. The judge is compassionate toward him and admonishes the FDA, but lacks the legal tools to do anything. As the film ends, on-screen text reveals that the FDA later allowed Woodroof to take peptide T for personal use and that he died of AIDS in 1992, seven years later than his doctors initially predicted.|$|E
5|$|Feeling a {{sense of}} debt to Pit, Dark Pit takes him to the Rewind Spring so time can be {{reversed}} for Pit's body.

Upon arrival at the Rewind Spring, Pandora is revived due to the Spring's effects on her stolen powers within Dark Pit. Pandora then uses the Spring to restore her health and ultimately her physical body, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> defeated by Dark Pit.|$|E

He agrees and the two marry. Shortly thereafter Baba dies. Amir and Soraya settle down in a happy marriage, but to their sorrow they learn that they cannot have children.|$|E
5|$|Izsha is a zerg advisor {{in service}} to Sarah Kerrigan. She is a unique type of zerg; one of a kind. Izsha exemplifies a {{midpoint}} for Kerrigan, standing between Kerrigan's cold rationality and the feral nature of the Swarm. She harkens back to {{the ideology of the}} Overmind, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> a rational individual. In earlier times, Kerrigan used her to store her thoughts and plans. On at least one occasion she entrusted Izsha with a plan to infest a planet using the hyper-evolutionary virus through its water supply. Izsha reunited with Kerrigan following the latter's de-infestation and subsequent return to the Swarm. She served as an advisor, recalling memories from Kerrigan's time as the Queen of Blades, and helping her to reclaim the Swarm while remaining attached to her queen's leviathan.|$|E
5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E

5|$|Murtagh becomes Eragon's new {{companion}} and {{they travel to}} the city Gil'ead to find {{information on how to}} find the Varden, a group of rebels who want to see the downfall of Galbatorix. While stopping near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about. As she is being dragged past she is revealed as an elf when her pointed ears are uncovered. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon escapes with the unconscious elf. During the escape, Eragon and Murtagh battle with Durza. Murtagh shoots Durza between the eyes with an arrow, and the Shade disappears in a cloud of mist. Having escaped, they run off. Eragon succeeds in communicating with the elf, whose name is revealed as Arya, and learns the location of the Varden. After some arguing, Murtagh decides to still travel with Eragon to the Varden <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> wary of them.|$|E
5|$|Psittacosaurus is {{the type}} genus of the family Psittacosauridae, which was also named by Osborn in 1923. Psittacosaurids were basal to almost all known ceratopsians except Yinlong and perhaps the Chaoyangsauridae. While Psittacosauridae was an early branch of the ceratopsian family tree, Psittacosaurus itself was {{probably}} not directly ancestral to any other groups of ceratopsians. All other ceratopsians retained the fifth digit of the hand, a plesiomorphy or primitive trait, whereas all species of Psittacosaurus had only four digits on the hand. In addition, the antorbital fenestra, {{an opening in the}} skull between the eye socket and nostril, was lost during the evolution of Psittacosauridae, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> found in most other ceratopsians and in fact most other archosaurs. It is considered highly unlikely that the fifth digit or antorbital fenestra would evolve a second time.|$|E
5|$|The College of Arms {{is also an}} {{authorised}} {{location for}} enrolling a change of name. In common law there is no obligation to undergo any particular formality to change one's name. However, {{it is possible to}} execute a deed poll, more specifically a deed of change of name, as a demonstration of intention to adopt and henceforth use a new name, and deeds poll may be enrolled either in the High Court or in the College. On being enrolled the deed is customarily 'gazetted', that is published in the London Gazette. The deed poll is not entered on the registers, <b>but</b> <b>is</b> <b>still</b> published, if the name change only affects one's given name.|$|E
