Long-run abnormal returns are also observed globally and they are related to an undervaluation index (Peyer and Vermaelen, 2009, RFS) consistent with the interpretation that managers are able to time the market by buying back their own shares at low prices.

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this chapter is to discuss the roles of ethics and wisdom in {{knowledge}} economies and specifically the place of ethics and wisdom in social research in knowledge economies. Approach - It does this through examining traditional theories of ethics, their application {{in the context of}} research ethics, and the origins of the current institutional ethics <b>approval</b> <b>regimes.</b> The limitations of consequentialist and deontological approaches to ethics in social research are articulated, as is the rise of neo Aristotelian virtue ethics - to which wisdom is integral. Questions are posed about several high-profile cases of past social research, {{and the extent to which}} these might be considered both unethical and unwise. Attention is then given to the place of wisdom in the practice of social research. Aristotle presents practical wisdom as an executive virtue that coherently integrates intellectual and ethical virtues to create deliberative excellence. Findings - Practical wisdom is thus seen as a way of performing as an educated, skilled, and ethical social actor with carefully constructed predispositions which automatically seek excellence and well-being. Furthermore, a wise social researcher considers the needs of others carefully to try to find the right thing to do, but in understanding others emotionally, intellectually, or otherwise, is not manipulative. The conclusion poses the question as to how practical wisdom might be developed applied to the practices of contemporary social research. 24 page(s...|$|R

The legislation has cost taxpayers somewhere between $ 72 million and $ 180 million to administer, but after six years it has not resulted in any significant improvements in environmental outcomesIn July 2005, the Australia Institute published a discussion paper on how effective the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) {{had been in the}} first five years of its operation. The paper concluded that the Act’s environmental assessment and <b>approval</b> (EAA) <b>regime</b> had ‘failed to produce any noticeable improvements in environmental outcomes’ (Macintosh and Wilkinson 2005, p. vii). More specifically, it found that the actions that were having the greatest detrimental affects on the matters of national environmental significance were rarely referred to the Federal Environment Minister and, when they were, the Minister had failed to take adequate steps to ensure appropriate conservation outcomes. Further, despite evidence of widespread non-compliance, the Commonwealth had only taken two enforcement actions in relation to the EAA regime in five years.

The analysis follows four steps. First, I examine the determinants of presidential approval at the individual level in Mexico, paying special attention to citizens' perceptions of rising crime and corruption as key determinants of voters' evaluation of the president after the democratic transition. Second, I extend my argument by analyzing the determinants of presidential approval as the sub-national level. Third, I conduct a multi-level analysis in order to show that after the 2000 presidential election, the turning point of the democratic transition, perceptions of crime and corruption strongly affected voters' evaluation of the president. And fourth, I examine the effects of presidential approval on roll call voting in Mexico before and after the transition. I show that since the 2000 democratic transition, perceptions of rising crime and corruption have become more salient, and citizens have begun to evaluate the president in terms of his determination to address these two problems. Moreover, I find that while presidential approval had positive effects on roll call voting before the democratic period, after the 2000 presidential election, the effects of presidential approval were positive for members of the president's party, but negative for opposition deputies. In the new Mexican democracy, opposition deputies considered that the best strategy to advance in their political careers was to embarrass the President and to frustrate his plans in Congres...|$|R

Although other National Socialists disapproved of Mussolini and Fascist Italy, Hitler had long idolized Mussolini's oratorical and visual persona and adopted much of the symbolism of the Fascists into the National Socialist Party, such as the Roman, straight-armed salute, dramatic oratory, the use of uniformed paramilitaries for political violence and the use of mass rallies to demonstrate the power of the movement. In 1922, Hitler tried to ask for Mussolini's guidance on how to organize his own version of the [...] "March on Rome" [...] which would be a [...] "March on Berlin" [...] (which came into being as the failed Beer Hall Putsch in 1923). Mussolini did not respond to Hitler's requests as he did not have much interest in Hitler's movement and regarded Hitler to be somewhat crazy. Mussolini did attempt to read Mein Kampf to find out what Hitler's National Socialist movement was, but was immediately disappointed, saying that Mein Kampf was [...] "a boring tome that I have never been able to read" [...] and remarked that Hitler's beliefs were [...] "little more than commonplace clichés". While Mussolini like Hitler believed in the cultural and moral superiority of whites over colored peoples, he opposed Hitler's antisemitic beliefs. A number of Fascists were Jewish, including Mussolini's mistress Margherita Sarfatti who was the director of Fascist art and propaganda and there was little support amongst Italians for antisemitism. Mussolini also did not evaluate race as being a precursor of superiority, but rather culture.|$|R
40|$|Introduction The gas {{transmission}} {{network in the}} Netherlands transports two different qualities of gas, low-calorific gas known as G-gas or L-gas and, high calorific gas (H-gas). These two gas qualities are transported in separate networks, and are connected by means of five blending and conversion stations where high-calorific gas can either be blended with low-calorific gas or ballasted with nitrogen to produce gas that can be introduced into the low-calorific, G-gas, network. The network was originally developed following {{the discovery of the}} large Groningen gas field. The Groningen field is low calorific gas. The low-calorific gas from the Groningen field became the standard for the consumers in the Netherlands. Later on, H-gas gas was produced from the so-called small fields in the Netherlands. High-calorific gas is also imported from Norway, Russia and through the LNG terminal in Rotterdam. The H-gas is supplied to industrial end users via approximately 80 connections to the high-calorific network and is also exported to other countries. The standard Wobbe Index bandwidth currently specified for exit points in the gas {{transmission network}} for H-gas is 47 - 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0), with a number of regional variations as described in the Ministerial Ruling (MR) for gas quality. The supply of low-calorific gas from the Groningen field is in decline, and ultimately the future supply to end users will be high-calorific gas. In March 2012, the Minister of Economic affairs declared that all appliances falling under the Gas Appliance Directive (the GAD) should be able to switch to high-calorific gas to prepare for a smooth transition {{at the end of the}} lifetime of the Groningen field. For this purpose, a formal notification has been given to the European Commission. However, at the moment it is unclear what the future range of high-calorific gas quality should be; that is, the range of gas quality that appliances falling under the GAD can accept is at present uncertain. The question posed by the Dutch government is whether or not the government should change the existing notification of the requirements that GAD gas appliances should be able to meet to cope with high-calorific gas, and if so, how and when. Analysis The study comprised three major areas of investigation. In the first step, the limitations in appliance performance with varying gas quality were assessed. This assessment is based on a critical analysis of existing data from laboratory experiments on appliances from well-defined field tests and also from a critical analysis of non-experimental information (theoretical studies and evidence-based experience). In the second step, the future ranges of gas quality expected to be supplied in the Netherlands was inventoried, and the possibilities for, and costs of, treating the gases to limit the range of gas quality was assessed. In the third step, the potential of innovation for widening the range of gases acceptable for appliances was assessed. The recommendations summarized below are based on the synthesis of these three elements. Limitations in appliances We assessed the existing experimental, theoretical and practical/experiential evidence regarding which bands of Wobbe Index maintain the safety and reliability of the population of H-/E-band appliances installed in the field. In our opinion, the distribution practices in the UK, France, Denmark and Belgium give the best reflection of a practical range for Wobbe Index: the years-long practice in these countries shows that H-/E-band appliance performance with distribution limits in the range 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 satisfies the national requirements and/or customs for safety and reliability in these countries. We also note that DNV GL – Report No. 74106553. 01 b – www. dnvgl. com Page 2 these countries have some form of active maintenance regime. Provided adjustable appliances are properly adjusted, the laboratory experiments assessed support a range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3, although these experiments require extra interpretation before being applied to the situation in practice. The theoretical analyses show that the <b>approval</b> <b>regime</b> does not safeguard the intended appliance performance in a number of situations. However, these analyses say nothing about the actual safe and reliable performance of appliances in the field. Therefore, we conclude that a bandwidth of in the range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 can be realized for appliances approved under the GAD. Future supply Ultimately, when Dutch indigenous gas production becomes small, gas is expected to be supplied by pipeline imports from Norway and Russia, and as LNG from the worldwide market. The Netherlands is expected to become a net importer from 2025 onwards. The expectation is further that the imported gas will have a Wobbe Index between 51 and 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0). The upper limit of 55. 7 MJ/m 3 is set by the Dutch government. This gas quality bandwidth is significantly smaller than the current standard bandwidth permitted in the H-network, from 47 to 55. 7 MJ/m 3. The ‘small fields’ contribute predominantly to the lower half of this range. At the moment an annual volume of 25 bcm is produced from the small fields. By 2032 the total capacity including so-called futures is expected to be almost three times lower than the 2014 capacities. These futures are however uncertain. When the futures are not taken into account, the total capacity will be 15 times lower compared to 2014. In 2032 supply from the small fields will then only be 3 % of demand (20 % if the futures fully materialize). Excluding futures, the production volume of the small fields decreases to 1 bcm in 2030. Three cases with different Wobbe Index bandwidths were evaluated: a band of 2 MJ/m 3, significantly narrower than the expected range of import qualities, a wide band of 8 MJ/m 3 and a band coincident with the expected future import band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3. The results show that the narrow band option requires the most gas treatment, particularly nitrogen ballasting, which given the expected import will be required indefinitely. The costs for gas treatment (especially nitrogen ballasting) will thus recur every year. The widest band allows the widest accommodation of both import gases and residual small-field gases. Referring to the appliance limitations analysis above, not all appliances can handle a band of 8 MJ/m 3 without further gas treatment measures. We note that the potential measures that support the intake of ‘off-spec’ gas with a Wobbe Index lower than the minimum Wobbe Index of H-gas imports are expected to be temporary. The volume of gas from the small fields is expected to become very small after 2030 as mentioned above. The use of the gas quality management options described here is seen more as a transition measure and not as permanent. In light of the expected gas supply, the widest band gives therefore only a temporary advantage. For the intermediate band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3, the import gases can be easily accepted, but relatively more small-field gases become ‘off spec’, requiring blending with the H-gas import. The forecast of H-gas imports volumes indicate that sufficient H-gas is available for blending the ‘off spec’ gas in this case. Ballasting with nitrogen will not be required if the upper Wobbe limit is set at 55. 7 MJ/m 3. Concluding, choosing the intermediate band of 4. 7 MJ/m 3 corresponds to the bandwidth of the expected import of future H-gases of 51 - 55. 7 MJ/m 3, and is also within the range of 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 to which the GAD appliances have been exposed in practice. In this option there are no extra costs for nitrogen ballasting. This range may provide an optimum between appliance performance and expected gas supplies. Innovation An inventory has been made to determine the status of the development of innovative products aimed at extending the fuel flexibility of GAD end-use equipment, e. g. by means of active control systems. The inventory is based on interviews with different stakeholders and collecting existing information available, including progress made in existing innovation programs such as SBIR. It became clear that commercially available (premixed) appliances having active control systems are suited to operate across the entire E-band and for handling abrupt Wobbe fluctuations. We also observed promising developments for (inexpensive) control systems for premixed appliances to extend the fuel flexibility for both new domestic appliances and suitable appliances already installed in the field. Also, a sensor-based hob burner (cooker) is under development to guarantee high performance and capacity while using variable gas quality (L+H band). DNV GL is not aware of any existing developments or innovations to make other type of partially premixed domestic appliances, such as flow-through hot water heaters, suitable for a wide range of gas compositions. To our knowledge, no innovation regarding the development of fuel-adaptive control systems for non-domestic burners is currently being undertaken. However, several control strategies are possible and economically feasible. Recommendation Based on the analysis, DNV GL recommends setting the long term quality bandwidth for H-gas at 51 – 55. 7 MJ/m 3 (25 / 0). In this choice, the bandwidth (4. 7 MJ/m 3) is within the 4 - 5 MJ/m 3 with which millions of H-/E-band appliances function in other EU countries, aligning the distribution practice with those in other countries, and complex and costly gas quality management measures are limited. A consistent policy for appliance adjustment using known gas quality is essential for maintaining this band. We recommend updating the existing notification and suggest modifications to the notification as formulated in Appendix A. We further note that in terms of Wobbe Index this band allows room for the accommodation of a reasonable bandwidth for renewable gases...|$|R
