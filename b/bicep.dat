5|$|The Los Angeles Rams, who {{had been}} hobbled by {{injuries}} much of the season, entered the playoffs with the worst record (9–7) of the six division winners. Rams defensive end Jack Youngblood played {{the game with a}} hairline fracture of his left leg, and Vince Ferragamo continued to start in place of the injured Pat Haden. On {{the other side of the}} ball, the Buccaneers lost Lee Roy Selmon and Cecil Johnson with ankle injuries, Doug Williams with a torn <b>bicep,</b> and Wally Chambers with a knee injury. Mike Washington and Dave Lewis also missed part of the game with injuries. The game was the Rams' second consecutive playoff win against a team that had beaten them decisively during the regular season. Each team had a touchdown called back due to a penalty. The Rams also had a touchdown called back when it was ruled that receiver Preston Dennard did not maintain possession of the ball. The Rams offensive line was intact, unlike in the regular-season matchup. This provided for 216 yards rushing and gave Ferragamo much time to complete passes. Another change from the earlier game was that Wendell Tyler had become the starting halfback for the Rams. With Tyler's speed enabling the Rams to run outside, the Buccaneers were no longer able to clog the inside lanes with defenders and put the linebackers into coverage on passing downs. The Buc defense's focus on Tyler freed Cullen Bryant to run for 106 yards on 18 carries. Meanwhile, Buc quarterbacks Williams and Mike Rae were 4–26 on pass attempts. It took until the third quarter for the Buccaneers to even pass midfield, on a halfback option pass from Jerry Eckwood to Larry Mucker.|$|E

25|$|The term, from Latin, for {{the main}} upper arm flexor in the {{singular}} is the biceps muscle (from biceps brachii); however, many English speakers take {{it to be a}} plural and refer to the muscle of only one arm, by back-formation, as a <b>bicep.</b> The correct —although very seldom used— Latin plural is bicipites.|$|E
25|$|On 17 December 2008, Way was {{involved}} in a serious accident on the A3088 Cartgate link road between the A303 and Yeovil whilst a passenger in a white van he was passenger in collided head-on with a blue 4x4. He was airlifted to Dorchester Hospital, where his condition was described as serious but stable, before being treated at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol. His injuries included a broken left femur, broken left kneecap, broken and dislocated right elbow, broken and dislocated left hip, multiple fractures of his right wrist, damage to his right hand, a ruptured left <b>bicep,</b> deep cuts to both shins and soft tissue damage. Initially Way hoped that {{he would be able to}} resume his footballing career. On 22 January 2009, Way was discharged from Yeovil Hospital, after having thirteen operations, marking a huge step on his road to recovery, although he was still wheelchair bound. During half-time in Terry Skiverton's first match in charge against Oldham Athletic, on 21 February 2009, Way came on the pitch in his wheelchair and did a lap of honour. Way had to learn how to walk again after his accident, and after his retirement he and stadium technician Bruce James were involved in a lengthy legal battle in the High Court with the insurers of the 4x4 driver over compensation for the accident.|$|E

He got a tattoo (his only one) of a golden calf {{on the inside of}} his right <b>bicep</b> as a reminder for him to [...] "not worship false idols" [...] and to remember that God comes first. Zito said that his wife is a Christian as well.|$|E
500|$|Valo {{is known}} to sport several tattoos. He has {{a total of five}} heartagram tattoos; one {{on the back of his}} neck, one on his lower stomach, one around his left nipple, one on his lower back, made to {{resemble}} a hexagram, and one on his right leg, as the topper on a scepter of a pope with an astronaut's head, called the [...] "Cosmic Pope". The heartagram around Valo's left nipple was done by Kat Von D to cover up the initial of a former girlfriend. Valo's left arm is covered with a full sleeve-tattoo, while his right arm has portraits of Timo K. Mukka, Charles Baudelaire and Charles Bukowski. On his right wrist Valo has a heart surrounded by lettering, and on his <b>bicep</b> a monogram of Venus Doom, as well as an hourglass and an eye with a skull inside the pupil.|$|E

While taking time off due to injury in 2009, Bautista had both upper arms covered in large, tribal style tattoos, including the word [...] "DC soldier" [...] on his right <b>bicep.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Two {{methods of}} {{promoting}} rotator cuff healing are injecting patients' own stem cells (or other growth factors) into {{the site of}} the repair, and installing scaffolds (natural or artificial supports that maintain tissue contour). The results of using PRP (platelet rich plasma) to augment the healing of rotator cuff repair at the time of surgery, although intellectually interesting, does not seem to demonstrate a statistically significant [...] clinical difference. [...] Biceps tenotomy and tendonesis are treatment alternatives for patients with rotator cuff tears as well as <b>bicep</b> tendon lesions. Tendonesis, which may be performed as an arthroscopic or open procedure, generally restores strength and function. Tenotomy is a shorter surgery, requiring less rehabilitation, that doctors tend to recommended for older patients.|$|E
2500|$|Suzuki's Koji Yoshiura {{designed}} {{the look of}} the new Hayabusa. He had previously styled the first generation Hayabusa, as well as the Suzuki Bandit 400, RF600R, TL1000S and the SV650. For research, Yoshiura traveled around the United States to bike nights and clubs for a first hand look at the styling aesthetic of the Hayabusa custom scene, and was inspired as much by the look and build of the Hayabusa rider as their custom bikes. While the second generation is very close to the first in overall shape, and is largely dictated by wind tunnel tests, the raised lines and curves are meant to suggest a muscular build. Said Yoshiura, [...] "I wanted to create a masculine form that complements a rider's muscular structure with hints of developed <b>bicep,</b> forearm and calves." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a {{defensive}} battle {{in which the}} Rams squandered numerous scoring opportunities, Rams kicker Frank Corral kicked 3 field goals to win the game. Los Angeles was able to record 369 yards of total offense, while running backs Cullen Bryant and Wendell Tyler rushed for 106 and 86 yards, respectively. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers only had 177 total offensive yards, including 92 rushing yards and 85 passing yards. [...] Tampa Bay starting quarterback Doug Williams completed just 2 of 13 passes before suffering a game-ending torn <b>bicep</b> injury. Most of Tampa Bay's passing yards came from a 42-yard halfback option pass from Jerry Eckwood to wide receiver Larry Mucker in the fourth quarter. During the game, two touchdowns were nullified by penalties, one by each team: a four-yard run by Bryant and a 27-yard reception by Buccaneers' tight end Jimmie Giles.|$|E
2500|$|On the January 4 {{episode of}} Nitro, Elizabeth was seen talking to police detectives. According to the storyline, she claimed that Bill Goldberg was {{stalking}} {{her and that}} he even accosted her by the water cooler. She then filed charges against Goldberg. Goldberg was arrested later that night for aggravated stalking and taken into custody by police. However, later that night, Elizabeth admitted that she was lying. As it turned out, Elizabeth was a pawn for the nWo so that Goldberg {{would be unable to}} have his scheduled title match with Kevin Nash later that night. Due to Goldberg's apparent absence, the returning Hulk Hogan took Goldberg's title shot in the match. Soon after, Elizabeth accompanied Lex Luger, and sometimes Kevin Nash, to ringside. Lex Luger, who was accompanied by Elizabeth at this time to ringside for single matches, was supposed {{to get ready for the}} tag team match against Konnan and Rey Mysterio Jr. with Miss Elizabeth's hair on the line and Rey Mysterio Jr.'s mask on the line at Superbrawl IX with Kevin Nash as his tag team partner. However, on the February 18, 1999 edition of WCW Thunder, at the E-Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, a limo pulled up and was driving along with Rey Mysterio Jr. with Luger and Elizabeth inside. As Elizabeth and Luger were getting out of the limo, Rey Mysterio Jr. grabbed the door and slammed it into Luger's biceps, injuring him in the process. Elizabeth was screaming at Rey who yelled [...] "thug life!". As Elizabeth closed the door, the limo left the arena with Luger and Elizabeth inside. Luger was immediately replaced by Scott Hall as Kevin Nash's tag team partner for the tag team match at Superbrawl IX. After Spring Stampede (1999) she took time off on the road with Luger to recover from his <b>bicep</b> injury and go through a divorce with her husband Cary Lubetsky.|$|E

50|$|Surgical {{treatment}} of the shoulder due to potential <b>bicep</b> tendonitis or a tear of the labrum otherwise known as a SLAP tear. The long head of the <b>bicep</b> passes through the shoulder joint and attaches to the labrum. During a biceps tenodesis procedure, the surgeon cuts the attachment of the biceps tendon from the labrum and reattaches it to the humerus bone by tacks. By doing this, pressure is relieved from the labrum significantly reducing pain. This surgery is performed to alleviate <b>bicep</b> inflammation and can be implemented in correspondence to a SLAP lesion surgery. Recovery is approximately 4 - 8 months depending on the individual and requires physical therapy.|$|E
