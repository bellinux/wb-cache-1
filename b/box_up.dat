6000|$|He {{held the}} open drawer out, {{and a young}} lady threw a piece of silver into it. Then Carl shut the <b>box</b> <b>up</b> and blew upon it. When he opened the box again the silver was gone! ...|$|E
60|$|It was a comical {{sight to}} see the boys of dormitories Nos. 11 and 12 {{walking back to the}} Hall, each with a shoe box under his arm. Sam Day led the procession, {{carrying}} his <b>box</b> <b>up</b> against his forearm, like a sword.|$|E
6000|$|... "Deuced serious," [...] cried Scott. [...] "The ham {{and eggs}} are burned! No--it's all right--saved, and done to a turn! Pull the <b>box</b> <b>up,</b> Anerley. Come on, Mortimer, stow that notebook! The fork is mightier than the pen just at present. What's {{the matter with}} you, Anerley?" ...|$|E

60|$|They {{carried the}} <b>boxes</b> <b>up</b> {{the ladder and}} Brown brought the cap and jacket.|$|R
60|$|More than this, he was <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> in {{a narrow}} place, from which escape was well-nigh impossible.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have in my}} {{possession}} a box {{belonging to}} de Cartienne, which contains a secret. Until I yield that <b>box</b> <b>up</b> to him I am safe, since he can only get it from me. You see that he tells me in this note to bring it with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{then there}} is a bedroom taken for you. A gentleman came three days ago and took it, saying it was for a young gent who is going through to Weymouth. Tom," [...] she called, [...] "take this <b>box</b> <b>up</b> to number 12. Supper is ready for you, sir. I dare say you would like a wash first?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come, let us get the box," [...] said Ham, {{and then}} he and Carl hurried down to the barn, where they found the flat box. Much to their {{surprise}} it was bound around and around with some old telegraph wire. Snap and his chums had wanted to nail the <b>box</b> <b>up</b> but had been afraid of the noise.|$|E
6000|$|... “Not a bite! I don’t expect ever to feel hungry {{until we}} get those <b>boxes</b> <b>up.</b> Lash the ladder while I couple the pipe to the pump!” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not exactly, lad," [...] said Captain Dornton grimly, [...] "but {{dead and}} sat {{upon by the}} coroner, and my body comfortably <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> and {{on its way to}} England." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So it was, Sam. But I've {{got to do}} something. This being <b>boxed</b> <b>up,</b> {{when one}} might be fishing or swimming, or playing baseball, is simply dreadful," [...] {{answered}} the other.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have {{copies of}} them, and full notes of {{everything}} that has transpired so far, in a strong <b>box</b> <b>up</b> at the bank," [...] Hunterleys assented. [...] "We can stroll up there after lunch and I will place all the documents in your hands. You can look them through then and decide what is best to be done." ...|$|E
6000|$|I will whisper {{it to the}} Mayor, {{he shall}} send a {{committee}} to England, [...] They shall get {{a grant from the}} Parliament, go with a cart to the [...] royal vault, [...] Dig out King George's coffin, unwrap him quick from the [...] graveclothes, <b>box</b> <b>up</b> his bones for a journey, [...] Find a swift Yankee clipper--here is freight for you, black-bellied clipper, [...] Up with your anchor--shake out your sails--steer straight toward [...] Boston bay.|$|E
60|$|On the morrow, as promised, the chocolates arrived, many {{pounds of}} them in a lordly box. The bludgeoning of fate had not wholly scotched in Ruth a human {{weakness}} for sweets, and it was with a distinct effort that she wrapped the <b>box</b> <b>up</b> again and returned it to the sender. She went off to her work at the mont-de-piete with a glow of satisfaction which comes to those who exhibit an iron will in trying circumstances.|$|E
50|$|In 2001, Darryl Neudorf, Tracy Pillsworth and the <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> studio {{moved to}} Toronto, Ontario. Once in Toronto, Neudorf {{continued}} {{to produce and}} engineer successful recordings, among others, Americana singer Neko Case.|$|R
6000|$|... "I’ve seen women having rows afore," [...] {{said the}} skipper, [...] "but {{then they could}} get away from each other. It’s being <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> in this little craft as does the mischief." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What!" [...] cried Julia: [...] "go <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> {{three in}} a postchaise in this weather, when we may have seats in a barouche! No, my dear Edmund, that will not quite do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The man's a {{dangerous}} ruffian who sticks at nothing. I'm thinking it wouldn't {{be a bad}} thing to put a rope round the chest and tow it alongside for half an hour; then we could open it at our ease. Or if we just tied the <b>box</b> <b>up</b> and kept him from getting any water maybe that would do as well. Or the carpenter could put a coat of varnish over it and stop all the blowholes." ...|$|E
60|$|I had got {{a number}} of friends of mine, stalwart men, to {{sprinkle}} themselves through the audience armed with big clubs. Every time I said anything they could possibly guess I intended to be funny they were to pound those clubs on the floor. Then {{there was a kind}} lady in a <b>box</b> <b>up</b> there, also a good friend of mine, the wife of the Governor. She was to watch me intently, and whenever I glanced toward her she was going to deliver a gubernatorial laugh that would lead the whole audience into applause.|$|E
6000|$|... "I was so stunned I didn't {{know what}} to do. I couldn't believe that Reff had taken them, {{and that he was}} guilty of the robberies that were going on. I locked the <b>box</b> <b>up</b> and put the key back in his pocket. That night I accused him of the theft, and we had a quarrel and almost came to blows. He said he didn't take the watch and chain, that he found them in the {{gymnasium}} near the lockers. He said he was only keeping them to get square with you, and that he would return them to you before the term closed." ...|$|E
60|$|On {{one side}} of the court-yard was a range of stables, now tenantless, but which bore traces of the fox-hunting squire; for there were stalls <b>boxed</b> <b>up,</b> into which the hunters might be turned loose when they came home from the chase.|$|R
60|$|KIT. Arethusa, if {{you looked}} at me like that I'd forgive you piracy on the high seas. I was only sulky; I was <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> there in the black dark, and couldn't see my hand. It made me pity that blind man, by George.|$|R
5000|$|In the Dreamworks Animation movie Madagascar, {{the song}} was used twice - the first was in normal speed when Alex the lion got tranquilized at Grand Central Station, then it played again in a very fast speed when he got tranquilized again before being <b>boxed</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Robinson," [...] {{the other}} man rejoined briskly, [...] "if you imagine I've had no {{experience}} of hardship of that sort, you never made a bigger mistake in your life. Why, when I first walked into this town I hadn't a cent, sir, not a cent, and as for lodging, all the place I had {{for months and months}} was an old piano <b>box</b> <b>up</b> a lane, behind a factory. Talk about hardship, I guess I had it pretty rough! You take a fellow that's used to a good warm tar barrel and put him into a piano box for a night or two, and you'll see mighty soon--" ...|$|E
6000|$|Such {{were a few}} of the {{thoughts}} that burned but found no utterance. The last thought however led to action. Verkimier, foolish man! was a smoker. He carried fusees. Slowly, with no more apparent motion than the hour-hand on the face of a watch, he let his hand glide into his coat-pocket and took out the box of fusees. The tiger seemed uneasy, but the bold man never for one instant ceased to glare, and no disturbed expression or hasty movement gave the tiger the slightest excuse for a spring. Bringing the <b>box</b> <b>up</b> by painfully slow degrees in front of his nose the man opened it, took out a fusee, struck it, and revealed the blue binoculars! ...|$|E
60|$|My surmise is this, that in London the Count {{decided to}} get back to his castle by water, as the most safe and secret way. He was brought from the castle by Szgany, and {{probably}} they delivered their cargo to Slovaks who took the boxes to Varna, for there they were shipped to London. Thus the Count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service. When the box was on land, before sunrise or after sunset, he came out from his box, met Skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the <b>box</b> <b>up</b> some river. When this was done, and he knew that all was in train, he blotted out his traces, as he thought, by murdering his agent.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{wish you}} {{was in the}} silent tombses, I do,' cried Mr Tappertit, 'and <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> tight, in a good strong one. Here,' he cried {{to one of the}} bystanders, in whose ear he whispered for a moment: 'Take her off, will you. You {{understand}} where?' ...|$|R
60|$|Luckily, {{those who}} painted my gallery were born before man. Therefore, my pictures, {{instead of being}} <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> by lumbering bars of gold, are {{disposed}} generously between latitudes, equinoxes, monsoons, and the like, and, making all allowance for an owner's partiality, they are really not so bad.|$|R
50|$|In 1803 Dorothy and William Wordsworth {{visited the}} castle and {{were told that}} a ruin {{on the top of}} the highest {{eminence}} had been a windmill and were shown a trout, <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> in a well close by to the guard room, that had been there for thirty years.|$|R
60|$|There was {{certainly}} something almost miraculous {{in the way}} the Capataz made the cove with nothing but the shadowy hint of the island's shape and the vague gleam of a small sandy strip for a guide. Where the ravine opens between the cliffs, and a slender, shallow rivulet meanders out of the bushes to lose itself in the sea, the lighter was run ashore; and the two men, with a taciturn, undaunted energy, began to discharge her precious freight, carrying each ox-hide <b>box</b> <b>up</b> the bed of the rivulet beyond the bushes to a hollow place which the caving in of the soil had made below the roots of a large tree. Its big smooth trunk leaned like a falling column far over the trickle of water running amongst the loose stones.|$|E
6000|$|... "Little, little ears!" [...] Arthur had said, {{pretending to}} pinch them one evening, as Hetty {{sat beside him}} on the grass without her hat. [...] "I wish I had some pretty ear-rings!" [...] she said in a moment, almost before she knew what she was saying--the wish lay so close to her lips, it WOULD flutter past them at the {{slightest}} breath. And the next day--it was only last week--Arthur had ridden over to Rosseter on purpose to buy them. That little wish so naively uttered seemed to him the prettiest bit of childishness; he had never heard anything like it before; and he had wrapped the <b>box</b> <b>up</b> in a great many covers, that he might see Hetty unwrapping it with growing curiosity, till at last her eyes flashed back their new delight into his.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tis {{out of my}} head whether I {{answered}} {{all your}} letter in my last yesterday or no. I think I was in haste, and could not: but now I see I answered a good deal of it; no, only about your brother, and ME's bill. I dined with Lady Orkney, and we talked politics till eleven at night; and, as usual, found everything wrong, and put ourselves out of humour. Yes, I have Lady Giffard's picture sent me by your mother. It is boxed up at a place where my other things are. I have goods in two or three places; and when I leave a lodging, I <b>box</b> <b>up</b> the books I get (for I always get some), and come naked into a new lodging; and so on. Talk not to me of deaneries; I know less of that than ever by much. Nite MD.|$|E
5000|$|Polls {{opened at}} 7:00 as Syrian state {{television}} showed voters lining up and dropping white ballots in large, plastic <b>boxes.</b> <b>Up</b> to 14.8 million voters were eligible to choose 250 legislators from 7,195 candidates, including 710 women from 12 different political parties, including seven newly formed political parties ...|$|R
5000|$|Victorino and Hunter {{were among}} a group {{squatting}} on Belanger's grandparents' property while they were away. [...] The group was using the property as a party house. Belanger, who had moved to Florida to look after her grandparents' home, had deputies evict the squatters and <b>boxed</b> <b>up</b> belongings left behind.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{will do it}} at once. There {{is nothing}} like making matters safe. Just get into the boat alongside, and row to the brig; {{and tell them to}} lower the jolly boat and send it alongside. We will get some of the <b>boxes</b> <b>up,</b> by the time you are back." ...|$|R
