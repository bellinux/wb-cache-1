40|$|Open {{transmission}} {{access and}} economic uncertainties {{are the reasons}} why many utilities {{around the world are}} operat-ing their transmission equipment at much higher loads than in the past. While considerable {{attention has been paid to}} the dynamic thermal rating of overhead lines, power transformers, and underground cables [1], substation equipment has generally been ignored. This seems to have occurred because of the assumption of relatively low replacement cost for switches, <b>buswork,</b> etc [...] The authors contend that the utilization of relatively simple dynamic rating algorithms, new simpler field temperature calibration methods, and the rising cost of outages required for equipment replacement, make the dynamic rating of substation equipment both practical and relatively cheap. This work was initiated by EPRI to supplement and extend the prior efforts to develop and field test dynamic rating methods for lines, cables, and power transformers [2]...|$|E

EMFWorkstation includes modules for estimating magnetic fields in residential environments (RESICALC) and in and around substations (SUBCALC). Modules for determining the electrical characteristics of one-, twoand three-phase circuits (Power Line Calculator) and estimating lateral profiles (ENVIRO) and twodimensional exposure (EXPOCALC) for electric and magnetic fields are also included. A newly added expert system module (EMFX) provides information about field sources, field management and field measurement. When used separately or together, these modules enable utility staff to estimate field exposures and facilitate the development of field management plans. This software runs under Microsoft ® Windows ™ and features a full graphical user interface (GUI) that includes CAD-style entry of electrical system components. Output can be presented in a variety of formats (surface maps, contour maps, profile plots and statistical tables). A database of transmission, distribution and grounding conductors that can accept user-specified configurations facilitates the retrieval and use of electrical system components. Complete editing capabilities allows modification and storage of existing models. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{bus driver}} {{scheduling}} problem involves assigning {{a set of}} drivers to cover all available bus work such that every bus is assigned a driver, the number of duties is minimised and each duty conforms to the rules governing them regarding maximum driving time and so on. Generally this problem is solved using mathematical programming methods. The University of Leeds has developed a driver scheduling system, TRACS-I I, that solves the bus driver scheduling problem by first generating a large set of potential duties and selecting a subset of these via the associated set covering ILP to form the schedule. The size of the set of potential duties used by TRACS-I I {{is directly related to}} the number of relief opportunities present in the original bus schedule. Each relief opportunity potentially serves as a handover point between two bus shifts. A bus schedule containing many relief opportunities can have a very large set of potential shifts generated to cover the <b>buswork.</b> The complexity of the ILP is related to the number of relief opportunities present in the bus schedule. This thesis describes a pre-processing stage for the TRACS-I I scheduling system. The pre-processor selects potentially useful relief opportunities from the bus schedule. The shifts generated by TRACS-I I are restricted to the subset of relief opportunities made available to it by the pre-processor. The reduction of the number of relief opportunities serves to reduce the complexity of the resulting set covering problem by reducing the number of variables and constraints in the ILP. The pre-processor itself uses constraint programming to find several possible ways of selecting relief opportunities from the morning and evening portions of the bus schedule. This is done by exploiting useful properties found in good driver schedules, specifically the chaining together of driver duties such that when one driver takes a break another driver finishing a break continues on the same bus. The pre-processor described has been shown to be effective on a wide variety of schedules in that the minimum number of drivers is almost always used and, in some cases, cheaper schedules can be produced...|$|E
