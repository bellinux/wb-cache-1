We find that firms increase their performance by engaging more in internal <b>basic</b> research, in particular if <b>basic</b> research is conducted in collaboration with university scientists. The exploitation of external <b>basic</b> research improves performance, while the magnitude increases with firms involvement in internal <b>basic</b> research. Hence, internal <b>basic</b> research and the exploitation of external <b>basic</b> research are complements, suggesting that internal <b>basic</b> research provides firms with the skills to exploit external <b>basic</b> research more effectively. <b>Basic</b> Research; Industrial Innovation; Pharmaceutical Industry...|$|R
