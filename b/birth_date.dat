5|$|In {{the first}} episode when Steve Owen pulls over Susie Money, when she hands him her license, one can {{momentarily}} see the <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> {{on the back of}} the card; it shows her birth year as 1984. Being that it is 1995 at the time of this scene, that would make her 11 years old.|$|E

5|$|Daniel Boone {{was honored}} with a 6-cent stamp in the American Folklore Series on September 26, 1968, at Frankfort, Kentucky, {{where he was}} buried. He was a famous frontiersman in the {{development}} of Virginia, Kentucky and the trans-Appalachian west. A wall of roughly-hewn boards displays the tools of Boone's trade—a Pennsylvania rifle, a powder horn, and a knife. The pipe tomahawk represents that the Shawnees had adopted Boone. His name and <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> were carved on the wall.|$|E

5|$|During Milhail Kogălniceanu's lifetime, {{there was}} {{confusion}} regarding his exact birth year, with several sources erroneously indicating it as 1806; {{in his speech}} to the Romanian Academy, he acknowledged this, and gave his exact <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> as present in a register kept by his father. It was also then that he mentioned his godmother was Marghioala Calimach, a Callimachi boyaress who married into the Sturdza family, and {{was the mother of}} Mihail Sturdza (Kogălniceanu's would-be protector and foe).|$|E
5|$|George Washington was {{the first}} child of Augustine Washington (1694–1743) and his second wife Mary Ball Washington (1708–1789), born on their Pope's Creek Estate near present-day Colonial Beach in Westmoreland County, Virginia. He was born on February 11, 1731, {{according}} to the Julian calendar and Annunciation Style of enumerating years then in use in the British Empire. The Gregorian calendar was adopted within the British Empire in 1752, and it renders a <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> of February 22, 1732.|$|E

30|$|The {{recordings}} from later half of 1990 s until 2005 {{have been}} used in our experiments. In all, the experimental corpus contains 534 recordings.

The <b>birth</b> <b>dates</b> of the Judges are known and hence their age at the time of an argument can be precisely calculated. The <b>birth</b> <b>dates</b> of the advocates are not easily available, hence wherever the <b>birth</b> <b>dates</b> were not available, their age has been approximated by using the year of their law graduation and assuming their age at graduation to be 25.|$|R

5|$|Charles VI's uncle, Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy, {{thought the}} {{proposed}} marriage ideal {{to build an}} alliance with the Holy Roman Empire and against the English. Isabeau's father agreed reluctantly and sent her to France with his brother, her uncle, on the pretext of taking a pilgrimage to Amiens. He was adamant {{that she was not}} to know she was being sent to France to be examined as a prospective bride for Charles, and refused permission for her to be examined in the nude, customary at the time. According to the contemporary chronicler Jean Froissart, Isabeau was 13 or 14 when the match was proposed and about 16 {{at the time of the}} marriage in 1385, suggesting a <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> of around 1370.|$|E
5|$|Estimates of Minnie's birthdate vary widely. The National Gallery of Victoria {{estimates}} around 1915; Birnberg's biographical {{survey of}} Indigenous artists from central Australia gives a <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> of around 1920; The new McCulloch's Encyclopedia of Australian Art suggests around 1922; Elizabeth Fortescue's biographical essay in Art of Utopia offers a range between 1910 and 1920. The uncertainty arises because Indigenous Australians often estimate dates of birth {{by comparison with}} other events, especially for those born before contact with European Australians. Minnie was one of six children, and had three sisters: Molly, born around 1920, Emily, born around 1922, and Galya, born in the 1930s. She was of the Anmatyerre and Alyawarre Aboriginal language groups.|$|E
5|$|In Ian Fleming's stories, James Bond {{is in his}} mid-to-late thirties, {{but does}} not age. In Moonraker, he admits to being eight years shy of {{mandatory}} retirement age from the 00 section—45—which would mean he was 37 at the time. Fleming did not provide Bond's date of birth, but John Pearson's fictional biography of Bond, , gives him a <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> of 11 November 1920, while a study by Bond scholar John Griswold puts the date at 11 November 1921. According to Griswold, the Fleming novels take place between around May 1951, to February 1964, by which time Bond was aged 42.|$|E

The steep {{decline in the number of}} members with <b>birth</b> <b>dates</b> after 1972 is unexplained, and is {{unlikely}} to be accounted for by change in diagnostic practice or registration and may reflect a true fall in disease incidence; but the fall in numbers of members with <b>birth</b> <b>dates</b> from 1941 to 1962 is explainable by a tendency for the disease to remit in adolescence or early adult life...|$|R

The school opened in 2007 with 570 students, fitting the initial prediction of between 450 and 600 students. 95 of these students had transferred to Dougherty from another school in the district, {{and the majority of}} the freshmen came from Windemere Ranch Middle School. The school started with only ninth grade freshmen and tenth grade sophomores in 2007, and in each successive school year another grade was added until the standard ninth to twelfth grade range was reached in 2009.|$|E
5|$|John was {{eldest son}} of {{the founder of the}} Angelos line, Constantine Angelos from Philadelphia, by Theodora Komnene, the seventh child of the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (ruled 1081–1118) and Empress Irene Doukaina. The couple, who married in 1110/15, had four sons and three daughters, of whom two, John and Andronikos (the father of the future {{emperors}} Isaac II Angelos and Alexios III Angelos), preferred to use their grandmother's far more prestigious surname of Doukas to their father's surname. The date of John's birth is unknown, and the only reference to his age is that in 1185 he was already an old man. The genealogist of the Komnenian family, Konstantinos Varzos, put his <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> approximately in 1125/27.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of William Bruce's youth, and his date of birth is unrecorded. He was {{probably}} born at Blairhall in western Fife, in around 1630, the second son of Robert Bruce of Blairhall and Katherine Preston. He may have attended St Andrews University in 1637–1638, which would suggest that his <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> was as early as 1625. The Bruces were a well-connected Episcopalian family, strongly loyal to the king, and descended from Thomas Bruce a cousin of King Robert II, who had been granted lands in Clackmannan and Fife. Bruce's first cousin Edward Bruce was created Earl of Kincardine in 1643.|$|E

5|$|Most {{official}} {{records show}} Davies's <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> as November 1886, {{but he is}} widely {{thought to have been}} born at least four years earlier. After leaving school aged 12 and working for some years in local pits, Davies studied mining engineering and later took an Arts degree at University College, Cardiff. He returned to the coalfields in 1913, and established a reputation for militancy. In 1918 he was elected miners' agent for the Dowlais district of the South Wales Miners' Federation (SWMF), and in 1924 was appointed SWMF's chief organiser, legal adviser, and vice-president. After a visit to Moscow in 1922 he became a firm advocate of the Soviet Union, a position he maintained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1921, {{while visiting}} friends in Greenwich Village, Hepburn {{discovered}} {{the body of}} her adored older brother, Tom, dead from an apparent suicide. He had tied a sheet around a beam and hanged himself. The Hepburn family denied it was suicide and maintained that Tom's death {{must have been an}} experiment that had gone wrong. The incident made the teenage Hepburn nervous, moody, and suspicious of people. She shied away from other children, dropped out of Oxford School, and began receiving private tutoring. For many years she used Tom's birthday (November 8) as her own. It was not until her 1991 autobiography, Me: Stories of My Life, that Hepburn revealed her true <b>birth</b> <b>date.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ramprasad {{was born}} in Halisahar, a village {{on the banks of}} the Ganges about thirty-five miles north of Kolkata, into a Tantric Vaidya family. Due to the absence of birth records, his actual <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> is not known, but it is {{believed}} to be around 1718 or 1723. His father, Ramram Sen, was an Ayurvedic doctor and Sanskrit scholar. Ramprasad's mother Siddheswari was Ramram's second wife. Ramprasad was sent to a Sanskrit tol (school) where he learned Sanskrit grammar, literature, Persian, and Hindi. As a youth, he had a talent for poetry and learning new languages.|$|E

5|$|Stigand (died 1072) was an Anglo-Saxon churchman in pre-Norman Conquest England {{who became}} Archbishop of Canterbury. His <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> is unknown, but by 1020 he was {{serving as a}} royal {{chaplain}} and advisor. He was named Bishop of Elmham in 1043, and was later Bishop of Winchester and Archbishop of Canterbury. Stigand was an advisor to {{several members of the}} Anglo-Saxon and Norman English royal dynasties, serving six successive kings. Excommunicated by several popes for his pluralism in holding the two sees, or bishoprics, of Winchester and Canterbury concurrently, he was finally deposed in 1070, and his estates and personal wealth were confiscated by William the Conqueror. Stigand was imprisoned at Winchester, where he died without regaining his liberty.|$|E
5|$|Theobald's {{family was}} from the area around Thierville near Le Bec-Hellouin, in the Risle River valley. The modern {{historian}} Frank Barlow speculates that Theobald {{may have been a}} distant relative of his successor as archbishop, Thomas Becket, as Becket's family came from the same part of Normandy. The exact date of Theobald's birth is unknown; the only clue to his age is that when he died in 1161 contemporaries considered him an old man, suggesting a <b>birth</b> <b>date</b> of perhaps around 1090 to one modern historian. His father was supposedly a knight, but no contemporary reference gives his name. His brother Walter also became a priest, and later a bishop.|$|E
5|$|Details of Evans’ {{early life}} are unknown, {{apart from his}} <b>birth</b> <b>date.</b> No book {{has been written about}} him, {{although}} he wrote his memoirs, Living The Beatles' Legend, from which extracts were released on 20 March 2005. What is known about him starts in 1961, when Evans married a Liverpool girl, Lily, after meeting her at a funfair in New Brighton opposite Liverpool on the Wirral. Their first child, Gary, was born in the same year. The Beatles were the resident group at Liverpool's Cavern Club when Evans first heard them perform during his lunch break. He was then living in Hillside Road, Mossley Hill and working as a telephone engineer for the Post Office. He became a committed fan, even though his musical hero at the time was Elvis Presley.|$|E
