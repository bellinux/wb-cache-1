Csikszentmihalyi suggested that breakthrough innovations tend to occur at the hands of individuals in that state. Other research has concluded that a strong internal motivation is a vital ingredient for <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovation.</b> Flow can be compared to Maria Montessori's concept of normalization, a state that includes a child's capacity for joyful and lengthy periods of intense concentration.

40|$|Does {{familiarity}} with alliance partners promote <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovations?</b> This study {{draws on the}} literature of interorganizational routines to {{examine the impact of}} repeated R&D collaborations within a firm's alliance portfolio on its <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovations.</b> Specifically, we contend that the benefits and liabilities of interorganizational routines, arising from alliance partner repeatedness at a firm's alliance portfolio level, lead to an inverted U-shaped relationship between alliance partner repeatedness and <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovations.</b> Further, we build on the recent theoretical development of interorganizational routines to propose that technological dynamism will make the inverted U-shaped relationship steeper. Analyses of approximately 230 firms in the US biopharmaceutical industry from 1983 to 2002 support our hypotheses. Our findings provide important implications for research on alliance portfolio and management of firm innovationpostprin...|$|R

40|$|This {{presentation}} {{is about the}} conditions under which new markets associated with <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovations</b> emerge. It is inscribed in an evolutionary perspective and focuses on {{the conditions under which}} selection unfolds out of variety. We suggest that the process is not “simply ” Darwinian (as the images used by economists in this approach often suggest), nor chaotic (as proposed by Cheng and Van de Ven) but that it entails an “in-between ” phase which we call “crystallisation”. This phase enables to build the selection environment, a wording that mixes dimensions from industrial economics (standard setting), science and technology studies (actor-network theory, role of controversies and hybrid fora) and management. The latter takes the work done on communities of practice from within organisations to inter-organisational space building. We use the case of asynchronous chip design to support our claims. This case helps pushing the hypothesis that the move from within to between organisations does not happen in a vacuum and that, for potential <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovations,</b> it is made possible through a set of public incentives, adapted to the different phases of the process...|$|R

If they have faced multiple work stoppages or have been unemployed {{in the past the}} probability of them becoming an entrepreneur increases Per Cattell's personality framework, both personality traits and attitudes are thoroughly investigated by psychologists. However, in case of entrepreneurship research, these notions are employed by academics too, but vaguely. According to Cattell, personality is a system that is related to the environment. He further adds that the system seeks explanation to the complex transactions conducted by both - traits and attitudes. This is because both of them bring about change and growth in a person. Personality is that which informs what an individual will do when faced with a given situation. A person's response is triggered by his/her personality and the situation that is faced.Innovative entrepreneurs {{may be more likely to}} experience what psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi calls flow.

Using longitudinal data from the U. S. pharmaceutical industry, we build alliance networks in the period 1985 - 2001 to investigate these questions. We show that, for <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovation,</b> collaborating with more partners that are more central in alliance networks the better, but only to a point. Beyond that point, we find that the likelihood of achieving <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovation</b> drops. Furthermore, and looking at the kinds of knowledge provided by the partners in each firm's alliances, we report that firms with a greater share of private partners, relative to public partners, suffer less from the diminishing benefits of collaboration with central partners when developing <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovation.</b> Taken together, we make novel contributions about how to organize for <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovation,</b> and provide actionable managerial advice in terms of selecting collaborative partners in alliance networks...|$|E

40|$|Past {{research}} has solidified that <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovations</b> are often {{prevalent in the}} context of entrants rather than incumbents. However, market leaders have been able to survive the disruption caused by market newcomers despite the irregularities of <b>breakthrough</b> <b>innovations</b> within incumbents. This paper will connect current research in corporate intrapreneurship from all perspectives including organizational behavior, corporate governance, incentive programs, and cultural relevance. Drawing from published literature and case studies this research will substantiate the following claim that the success of leading intrapreneurial organizations is due to their capability to support an ecosystem of innovative organizational choices in accordance with their goals and objectives. This paper will propose that there are three main steps to fostering a sustainable startup mentality within an organization. These phases include idea generation, supporting new corporate ventures, and creating a positive learning cycle. Within each phase, the firm has to pay special attention to important aspects of the organization including organizational culture, corporate structure, venture selection, team formation, venture programs, supportive infrastructure, sustainable venture development and positive learning cycles [...] by Lucy L.
