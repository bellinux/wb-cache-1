2500|$|Inspired by the mended uniforms of the Swiss {{soldiers}} {{after the}} country's 1477 {{victory over the}} Duke of Burgundy, elaborate slashing remained popular, especially in Germany, where a fashion arose for assembling garments in alternating bands of contrasting fabrics.

[...] These were often decorated with bands of embroidery or applied passementerie.

50|$|Brussels lace is part lace. This {{is made in}} pieces, {{with the}} flowers and design made {{separate}} from the ground, unlike Mechlin lace or Valenciennes lace; because of this, the long threads that form the design always follow the curves of the pattern, whereas in <b>bobbin</b> <b>laces</b> made all at once, the threads are parallel {{to the length of}} the lace. Brussels lace is also distinguished by its réseau or background, the toilé or pattern, and the lack of a cordonnet outlining the pattern. The réseau is hexagonal, with four threads plaited four times on two sides, and two threads twisted twice on the remaining four sides. The toilé can be of two types, the standard woven texture like a piece of fabric, or a more open version with more of the appearance of a netted réseau. This allows for shading in the designs, an effect that was used more in the later designs. In Brussels lace, instead of a cordonnet, the pattern is edged with open stitches, which are then picked up to form the réseau.|$|R

5000|$|The British press showed {{considerable}} {{interest in}} the lace used in the wedding dress, but their published reports are at variance with available documentation, and suggest that they were briefed with common incorrect or misleading information. The facts about the lace are as follows. The effect achieved by {{the design of the}} bodice {{is similar to that of}} the decorated nets that were popular in the late 19th century, typified by the Limerick and Carrickmacross laces of Ireland. For the latter, machine-made net is used as a basis on which floral and other designs are created by various hand-needlework techniques. The press release from the Royal School of Needlework [...] states that the technique used in Kate’s wedding dress “was influenced by” traditional Carrickmacross lace technique. However, the technique itself was a completely different and modern device: floral motifs were cut out of lengths of lace produced on large 19th-century machines and stitched to machine net. Three companies are known to have produced lace for the dress: Sophie Hallette [...] and Solstiss [...] in France, and the Cluny Lace Company in Ilkeston, Derbyshire. The majority of the dress is made using the Solstiss lace, specifically the skirt and train. The styles of machine lace go by the names [...] "English Cluny" [...] and [...] "Chantilly", but should not be confused with the older hand-made <b>bobbin</b> <b>laces</b> of the same names. The lace was not specially commissioned for the dress, but chosen from stock patterns (what was formerly known only as Sophie Hallette’s [...] "950264" [...] is now known as [...] "Kate’s lace", however, this lace was only used for the bodice of the dress, the skirt and train are made of the Solstiss lace. Grace Kelly's wedding dress was also made from lace by Solstiss, a French company. All the companies involved are known to produce the highest quality of couture lace. [...] ) and hence the floral motifs available were those present in the patterns. Although roses and perhaps shamrocks may be discerned on the bodice, the much quoted daffodils and thistles needed to complete a British quartet seem to be embroidery of the truth rather than of the dress.|$|R

Uma etnografia que busca alcançar, ainda que provisória ou sucintamente, as relações que se constituem entre rendas e rendeiras no espaço da Casa. Tomando como referência teórica o autor Ingold (2007, 2012) interessa-me expressar e enfatizar as diversas relações que se estabelecem entre rendas e rendeiras nos movimentos das linhas que compõem os pontos das rendas. Para expressar as diversas relações que pude apreender no local, baseio-me no desenho de meshwork, tal como proposto por Ingold (2012), em que as linhas são os vestígios dos materiais das rendas conjuntamente com o conhecimento técnico e habilidade de cada rendeira mostrando o aprendizado de rendar, a técnica, as relações das rendeiras na Casa, enquanto um espaço de sociabilidade e, ainda os aspectos emocionais e estéticos envolvidos no ofício de rendar. Nessa perspectiva, o ofício de rendar é pensada como um modo de conhecimento transmitido na Casa das Rendeiras na relação rendas e rendeiras. This {{work has}} as objective {{to investigate the}} several ways {{of the existence of}} <b>bobbins</b> <b>lace</b> made by the lace-makers, women from "Casa das Rendeiras", in Ilha Grande (Morros de Mariana, PI-Brazil), in its production and confection process, from the very gathering of the raw material to the sale of the laces. It presents an ethnography that intends to apprehend, though briefly, the relations that are constituted between laces and lace-makers in the space of Casa das Rendeiras. Drawing upon Ingold's theoretical ideas, my interest is to focus on the several relations established between the laces and lace-makers in the movements of lines that shape the lace's points. In order to express the relations observed in the place I took for basis the meshwork drawing as proposed by Ingold (2012), where the lines are traces of the lace's material conjugated to the technical knowledge and the ability of each lace-maker showing the lace making learning, the technique, the lace-makers relations in Casa das Rendeiras as a place of sociability, and yet the emotional and aesthetic aspects involved in the work of making laces. Upon this perspective the work of making laces is thought as a kind of knowledge transmitted in Casa das Rendeiras in the relation between laces and lace-makers...|$|R

The leader of the expedition, Dr. Antoni Ballester, would end up suffering a stroke that led Josefina Castellví to take over and run the small facility {{at a time when}} resources were quite limited for the Antarctic program. That was how she became the first female head of a foundation in the history of international Antarctic research. After retiring, she devotes her time to <b>lace</b> <b>bobbin</b> and gardening, her two passions today, but the photos hanging on the wall of her house and her collection of miniature penguins ensure the memory of her greatest adventure. In addition, she finds the suitcase with 30 hours’ worth of film she had captured herself during her first years on the white continent. Because of this and the pressure of nostalgia, Josefina decided to return to Antarctica.|$|R
