5|$|Romeo and Juliet borrows from a {{tradition}} of tragic love stories dating back to antiquity. One of these is Pyramus and Thisbe, from Ovid's Metamorphoses, which contains parallels to Shakespeare's story: the lovers' parents despise each other, and Pyramus falsely <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> lover Thisbe is dead. The Ephesiaca of Xenophon of Ephesus, written in the 3rd century, also contains several similarities to the play, including {{the separation of the}} lovers, and a potion that induces a deathlike sleep.|$|E

5|$|Self-referencing is {{a feature}} {{specific}} to Kiarostami's cinema. Stephen Bransford contends that Kiarostami's films {{do not contain}} references {{to the work of}} other directors, but do include a myriad of references to his own work. Bransford <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> films are often fashioned into an ongoing dialectic: one film reflecting on and partially demystifying an earlier film.|$|E

The father meets with the mistress and leaves Sue in her care, much to Sue's distress.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Blair {{promises}} his Chancellor, Gordon Brown {{that he will}} resign {{before the}} next general election, but later changes his mind. Brown subsequently attempts to blackmail him, threatened {{to call for a}} Labour Party inquiry into the 2005 Cash for Honours affair during an argument over pension policy. Brown succeeds Blair as Labour Party leader and Prime Minister in 2007. But while Blair praises Brown as a good Chancellor and a committed public servant, he <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> decision to abandon the New Labour policies of the Blair years leads to the party's 2010 election defeat. However, Brown is right to restructure British banks and introduce an economic stimulus after the financial crisis.|$|E

Into her life enter two radically different men. One of them is her boss, Thyagu (Rajinikanth), who owns the advertising agency she works for. He is a stereotype of the successful man: money-minded, opinionated, arrogant, and a male chauvinist. In sharp contrast is Arun (Kamal Haasan), who has come to Chennai from Coimbatore to make a documentary on women. Sensitive and sincere, he <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> job has a purpose and is both shocked and amused at the cynical attitudes of Manju and Thyagu.|$|E

Mulder talks to Barry, who claims that the aliens performed painful tests on him and put tracking devices in his body. Mulder—against Agent Kazdin's orders—tells Barry that he <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> story, convincing him to let two more hostages go.

5|$|The mysterious man {{is named}} Saavedro. Twenty years earlier, Atrus' wayward sons Sirrus and Achenar {{destroyed}} Saavedro's home Age of Narayan and trapped him on J'nanin. Saavedro <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> family {{is dead and}} swears vengeance on Atrus, unaware that Atrus has already imprisoned his sons for their crimes and that Saavedro's family is still alive. The game can end several ways depending on the player's actions. In the most ideal scenario, Saavedro returns to Narayan peacefully after giving back the book of Releeshahn. Other endings result in Saavedro destroying Releeshahn or killing the player; another option allows the player to leave Saavedro trapped forever.|$|E

5|$|Eeyore's Birthday Party {{began in}} 1963 as a spring party and picnic for Department of English {{students}} at the University of Texas at Austin by Lloyd W. Birdwell, Jr. and other UT students. It was named for Eeyore, a chronically depressed donkey in A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh stories who, in one story, <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> friends have forgotten his birthday only to discover they have planned a surprise party for him. Despite its name, the event does not fall on the official birthday of the fictional character. The original event featured a trashcan full of lemonade, beer, honey sandwiches, a live, flower-draped donkey, and a may pole (in keeping with the event's proximity to May Day). For many years the party was a UT tradition, but subsequently the annual Birthday Party became a tradition in Austin's hippie subculture.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Mulder's mother Teena {{is found}} dead in her home. It is found she overdosed on {{sleeping}} pills after she burned all her pictures of Samantha and placed tape around her baseboards and turned the gas in the oven on. Mulder believes she was murdered and has Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) do an autopsy. Later, Mulder visits the mother who was convicted twelve years prior. She tells him that Samantha is a walk-in, a kind spirit who takes children {{so that they may}} be shielded from potential harm in their life. The mother tells Mulder that the children are safe, but she has no idea where they are. After hearing this, Mulder <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> mother probably also wrote a note after his sister's disappearance. He begins to think that the alien abduction never happened, and that his mother figured this out, which is why she was murdered. However, after performing the autopsy, Scully tells Mulder that it was definitely suicide, because she was ill with Paget's carcinoma.|$|E
5|$|Samar {{notices that}} Meera often prays at church. After {{a night of}} wild street dancing, they begin to fall in love.

Samar recovers and Meera reveals the vow she made. Angry, he leaves her and London altogether, challenging God to keep him alive as he risks his life every day. He <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> death {{is the only way to}} make Meera lose her faith in God. He goes to India and enlists in the army, becoming a bomb-disposal expert.|$|E
5|$|While {{investigating}} a murder involving a hitman, Howard (Melissa Leo) and Felton (Daniel Baldwin) question Miles Stradinger (Paul Schulze), {{who serves as}} an arbitrator between hitmen and their customers. Stradinger gives up several of his clients, including Calpurnia Church (Mary Jefferson), a woman suspected of murdering five husbands for insurance money. Although Church denies killing anybody, the detectives find enough evidence to close many outstanding cases. Lewis, who had previously been investigating the Church case, <b>believes</b> <b>his</b> prayer with Crosetti led to her arrest. This is further upheld when Crosetti receives an anonymous call claiming a man named Alfred Smith shot Thormann. While searching for Smith, Crosetti meets a man named Charles Flavin (Larry E. Hull) who said he saw Smith shoot Thormann and will testify to it in court. The episode ends with Crosetti sitting with an unconscious Thormann {{in the hospital and}} listening to jazz music, which the two friends used to discuss frequently.|$|E
