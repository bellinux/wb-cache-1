50|$|Salix fragilis, {{with the}} common names crack willow and <b>brittle</b> <b>willow,</b> is a species of willow native to Europe and Western Asia. It is native to {{riparian}} habitats, usually found growing beside rivers and streams, and in marshes and water meadow channels.|$|E
50|$|The Uralic {{homeland}} is unknown. A possible {{focus is}} the Comb Ceramic Culture of ca 4200 - ca 2000 BC (shown {{on the map}} to the right). This {{is suggested by the}} high language diversity around the middle Volga River, where three highly distinct branches of the Uralic family, Mordvinic, Mari, and Permic, are located. Reconstructed plant and animal names (including spruce, Siberian pine, Siberian Fir, Siberian larch, <b>brittle</b> <b>willow,</b> elm, and hedgehog) are consistent with this location. This is adjacent to the proposed homeland for Proto-Indo-European under the Kurgan hypothesis.|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} {{commonly}} called crack willow or <b>brittle</b> <b>willow</b> {{because it is}} highly susceptible to wind, ice and snow damage. The name also derives from the twigs which break off very easily and cleanly at the base with an audible crack. Broken twigs and branches can take root readily, enabling the species to colonise new areas as broken twigs fall into waterways and can be carried some distance downstream. It is particularly adept at colonising new riverside sandbanks formed after floods. It also spreads by root suckers, expanding into pure 'groves'.|$|E
60|$|Beatrice {{picked her}} way {{cautiously}} toward a straggling bluff, for the ponds along its edge had overflowed {{and the ground}} was marish. On reaching the woods she stopped in a sheltered nook to enjoy the sunshine. The birches and poplars were bare, but their stems were changing color and the twigs had lost their dry and <b>brittle</b> look. The <b>willows</b> in a hollow were stained with vivid hues by the rising sap, {{and there was a}} flush of green among the grass. Small purple flowers like crocuses were pushing through the sod. From high overhead there fell a harsh, clanging cry, and the girl, looking up, saw a flock of brent geese picked out in a wedge against the sky. Behind came a wedge of mallard, and farther off, gleaming snowily, a flight of sandhill cranes. Spring was in the air; the birds had heard its call, and were pressing on toward the polar marshes, following the sun. Beatrice felt a curious stirring of her blood. It was half pleasant, half painful, for while she responded to the gladness that pervaded everything the sunshine kissed, she was conscious of a disturbing longing, a mysterious discontent. She would not try to analyze her feelings, but she felt that her life was narrow and somehow incomplete.|$|R
40|$|Every year, {{experts and}} laic {{community}} are {{more aware of}} the problems posed by non-native species. It is increasingly necessary {{to look for ways to}} inhibit the colonization or spread of non-native species, as they do not benefit our own native species. Thus, the main goal of my diploma thesis was to find out if the extract of <b>brittle</b> <b>willow</b> (Salix fragilis) affects the growth and development of Japanese knotweed (Fallopia japonica). In the previous study, the plants of Japanese knotweed were watered with 0. 1 % and 1 % essence of aqueous extract of <b>brittle</b> <b>willow</b> and distilled water. I took some samples of leaves and roots from each group of plants and prepared them forspetrofotometric measurments. I measured the concentrations of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and xanthophylls in each sample. I also measured the fresh and dry weight of the samples, and calculated the water from these data. I calculated the mean and standard deviation, and then further processed the results using Student's t-test. Despite stresss is reflected in biochemical and physiological changes, in our thesisextract of <b>brittle</b> <b>willow</b> didn't reflect on japanese knotweed...|$|E
40|$|Intact brittle willows (Salix fragilis L.) {{were treated}} so that {{developing}} adventitious root primordia in the stems would {{be subjected to}} elevated gibberellic acid or reduced endogenous auxin levels. Observations were made of primordia that were initiated during the experiments and of primordia that were established before the experiments began. The results indicated that as primordia became older and contained more cells, auxin basipetally transported in the stem seemed to be of less importance in determining cell number per primordium. Thus, established primordia depended upon this auxin {{to a lesser extent}} than primordia which were being initiated. These observations were explained on the basis of differential contributions during primordium development of cell division in the cambium of the stem and in the primordia themselves. As opposed to the effects of reduced auxin levels, applied gibberellic acid reduced the cell number per primordium most in established primordia. Initiating primordia were least affected by gibberellic acid treatment. Gibberellic acid treatment seemed mainly to reduce intraprimordium cell division, on which continued development of established primordia most depends. Seemingly, at least in <b>brittle</b> <b>willow,</b> applied gibberellic acid blocks the action of auxin in primordium development subsequent to the initiation phase...|$|E
