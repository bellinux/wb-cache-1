25|$|The {{government}} of Austria-Hungary {{knew from the}} early days of the First World War that it could not count on advances from its principal banking institutions to meet the growing costs of the war. Instead, it implemented a war finance policy modeled upon that of Germany: in November 1914, the first funded loan was issued. As in Germany, the Austro-Hungarian loans followed a prearranged plan and were issued at half yearly intervals every November and May. The first Austrian bonds paid 5% interest and had a five-year term. The smallest <b>bond</b> <b>denomination</b> available was 100 kronen.|$|E
2500|$|The limited {{financial}} resources of children were tapped through campaigns in schools. The initial minimum Austrian <b>bond</b> <b>denomination</b> of 100 kronen still exceeded {{the means of}} most children, so the third bond issue, in 1915, introduced a scheme whereby children could donate a small amount and take out a bank loan to cover {{the rest of the}} 100 kronen. The initiative was immensely successful, eliciting funds and encouraging loyalty to the state and its future among Austro-Hungarian youth. Over [...] kronen was collected in the first three [...] "child bond" [...] issues.|$|E

2500|$|Canada's {{involvement}} in the First World War began in 1914, with Canadian war bonds called [...] "Victory Bonds" [...] after 1917. The first domestic war loan was raised in November 1915, but not until the fourth campaign of November 1917 was the term Victory Loan applied. The First Victory Loan was a 5.5% issue of 5, 10 and 20 year gold <b>bonds</b> in <b>denominations</b> as small as $50. It was quickly oversubscribed, collecting $ or about $50 per capita. The Second and Third Victory Loans were floated in 1918 and 1919, bringing another $. For {{those who could not}} afford to buy Victory Bonds, the government also issued War Savings Certificates. The government awarded communities who bought large amounts of bonds Victory Loan Honour Flags.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{determinants}} of sovereign debt crises by using cross-country data from 1977 to 2010. In particular, I focus {{on the structure of}} sovereign debt by analysing the debt composition (domestic versus external), maturity structure (short-term versus long-term), composition type (bank loans versus <b>bond)</b> and currency <b>denomination</b> (domestic currency versus foreign currency) of debts. I also assess whether the previous history of banking and currency crises affect the likelihood of a sovereign debt crisis. The results suggest that both the structures of debt and the past history of other financial crises are important determinants of debt crises. The results are robust when using alternative measures to understand the risks of sovereign debt. I also investigate the impacts of debt structure and past financial crises history on the levels and changes of foreign and local currency long-term debt credit ratings...|$|R
50|$|Table 2 shows {{series of}} bonds and CDs with {{staggered}} maturities whose coupon and principal payments will match {{the stream of}} income shown in the Target Cash Flows column in Table 1 (rates are fictitious for this example). The cash flow generated by the portfolio {{for the first year}} would be $100,380. This consists of the principal of the bond maturing on February 15 next year plus the coupon interest payments flowing from all the other bonds. The same would be true for the following year and every year thereafter. The total cash flows generated over the eight years sum to $889,350, compared to the target cash flow sum of $889,234, a difference of only $116. As with the first year, the cash flows are very close to the target cash flows needed for each year. The match cannot be perfect because bonds must usually be purchased in denominations of $1,000 (municipal <b>bonds</b> in <b>denominations</b> of $5,000). However, with the use of fairly sophisticated mathematical optimization techniques, correlations of 99 percent or better can usually be obtained. These techniques also determine which bonds to buy so as to minimize the cost of meeting the cash flows, which in this example is $747,325. Note that in this example, the bonds all mature on February 15, the middle of the first quarter. Other dates may be used, of course, such as the anniversary date of the portfolio’s implementation.|$|R
500|$|Alongside {{the land}} {{certificate}} sales, MacGregor spent several months organising {{the issue of}} a Poyaisian government loan on the London Stock Exchange. As a precursor to this he registered his 1820 land grant at the Court of Chancery on 14 October 1822. Sir John Perring, Shaw, Barber & Co., a London bank with a fine reputation, underwrote a £200,000 loan—secured on [...] "all the revenues of the Government of Poyais" [...] including the sale of land—and offered provisional certificates or [...] "scrip" [...] for the Poyaisian bonds on 23 October. The <b>bonds</b> were in <b>denominations</b> of £100, £200 and £500, and offered at a marked-down purchase price of 80%. The certificate could be acquired for 15%, with the rest due over two instalments on 17 January and 14 February 1823. The interest rate was 6% per annum. If the Poyaisian issue successfully emulated its Colombian, Peruvian and Chilean counterparts, MacGregor stood to amass a fortune.|$|R
40|$|Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIP) {{states that}} <b>bonds</b> in {{different}} <b>denomination</b> should {{produce the same}} returns if the maturities of the bonds are the same. Given this, if a foreign bond produces a lower holding period return than a home bond of the same maturity, for their remaining lives the same foreign bond ought to produce a return higher than the home bond. A test is designed according to this relationship. With 1 to 6 year interest rate data of U. S., Britain and Germany from 1979 to 2005, our test shows that this relationship is more reliable for 6 -year interest rates than the shorter rates in general. This result lends support to the long-run UIP. A trading strategy is developed by utilizing this idea. We show that positive returns {{can be achieved by}} the strategy for bonds of longer horizons. This result also serves as indirect evidence of the long-run UIP. ...|$|R

40|$|Post debt relief, {{the number}} of African {{countries}} considering accessing international capital markets, often to fund large infrastructure projects, is increasing. Potential risks of capital inflows are well known but the literature offers little help to estimate the cost of borrowing internationally for the first time. This paper proposes a two-step approach to estimate the sovereign credit rating and interest rate cost of a country considering borrowing externally. Estimates {{can be used to}} assess {{the costs and benefits of}} different financing options. The method can also be used to construct foreign currency as well as domestic local currency yield curves.

5000|$|In recent years, metal {{boxes of}} {{fraudulent}} Federal Reserve Notes in astronomically high denominations (often in $100 million, $500 million, or $1 billion) and often with coupons attached {{have turned up}} in various eastern countries such as the Philippines or Malaysia. In many cases, the notes are claimed {{to be part of}} a lost trove of secretly issued Federal Reserve Notes, and are special or not known to the public due to secrecy. Also, the bonds are sometimes treated to make them look old by getting them wet and moldy. However, the Federal Reserve has never issued notes in such denominations, and has issued warnings against them on its website. Additionally, there are several errors in the bonds as well as the metal boxes, many of them anachronistic. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York writes thatThe Federal Reserve is aware of several scams involving high denomination Federal Reserve notes and <b>bonds,</b> often in <b>denominations</b> of 100 million or 500 million dollars, dating back to the 1930s, usually 1934. In each of these schemes, fraudulent instruments are claimed {{to be part of a}} long-lost supply of recently discovered Federal Reserve notes or bonds.Fraudsters often falsely claim that the purported Federal Reserve notes or bonds that they hold are somehow very special and are not known to the public because they are so secret. Fraudsters have attempted to sell these worthless instruments, or to redeem or exchange them at banks and other financial institutions, or to secure loans or obtain lines of credit using the fictitious instruments as collateral.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} link between the {{cyclical}} patterns of macroeconomic and policy variables and the currency composition of domestic sovereign debt in emerging market countries. The empirical analysis is anchored in an equilibrium model, in which the dollarization of sovereign debt arises {{as a result of the}} optimal portfolio choices by risk-averse investors, and of a sovereign debt manager who takes fiscal policy as given. The model predicts that in countries where the exchange rate is countercyclical (i. e., the exchange rate depreciates during recessions), a more procyclical fiscal policy (i. e., expansionary in good times and contractionary in bad times) would lead, on average, to a more dollarized domestic sovereign debt. The empirical analysis using the Jeanne-Guscina EM Debt database (2006) on the currency structure of the central government debt in 22 emerging market countries over 1980 - 2005, supports these predictions.
