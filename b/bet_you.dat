500|$|House {{is often}} filmed using the [...] "walk and talk" [...] filming technique, popularized on {{television}} by series such as St. Elsewhere, ER, Sports Night, and The West Wing. The technique {{involves the use}} of tracking shots, showing two or more characters walking between locations while talking. Executive producer Katie Jacobs said that the show frequently uses the technique because [...] "when you put a scene on the move, it's a... way of creating an urgency and an intensity". She noted the significance of [...] "the fact that Hugh Laurie spans 6'2" [...] and is taller than everybody else because it certainly makes those walk-and-talks pop".

[...] "Cameras and special effects travel not only down the throat" [...] of one patient, another critic observed, [...] "but up her nose and inside her brain and leg".

500|$|Fujisawa and Honda visited Kreidler and Lambretta showrooms, {{as well as}} others, {{researching the}} kind of {{motorcycle}} Fujisawa had in mind. [...] Fujisawa said these designs had [...] "no future" [...] and would not sell well. His concept was a two wheeler for everyman, one that would appeal to both developed and developing countries, urban and rural. The new motorcycle needed to be technologically simple to survive in places without up-to-date know-how and access to advanced tools or reliable spare parts supplies. The common consumer complaints of noise, poor reliability, especially in the electrics, and general difficulty of use {{would have to be}} addressed. Because Honda was a large company growing larger, it needed a mass-appeal product that could be produced on an enormous scale. The design had to be sorted out before production began, because it would be too costly to fix problems in the vast numbers that were to be manufactured. The scooter type nearly fitted the bill, but was too complex for developing countries to maintain, and the small wheels did poorly on badly maintained or nonexistent roads. Another of Fujisawa's requirements was that it could be ridden with one hand while carrying a tray of soba noodles, saying to Honda, [...] "If you can design a small motorcycle, say 50cc with a cover to hide the engine and hoses and wires inside, I can sell it.

500|$|The New York Times writer Stephen Holden {{considered}} Bedtime Stories as [...] "easily Madonna's best album", {{and concluded}} {{that it was a}} [...] "seductive mixture of soft-focus hip-hop and bittersweet ballads". Peter Galvin from The Advocate magazine gave a positive review, describing the album as [...] "a gorgeously produced R album with lots of funky beats lush keyboards, and soaring Love Unlimited-style string arrangements". Barry Walters from The San Francisco Examiner praised the album as Madonna's most low-key album and her best work at the date. J.D. Considine, while writing his review for the album for The Baltimore Sun, declared that Bedtime Stories was more listener-friendly than Madonna's previous albums. He added that it [...] "seems remarkably close in spirit to the singer's first album, emphasizing dance grooves and pop melodies over genre exercises and conceptual statements", while praising Madonna's vocal performance. Linda L. Labin from the Bangor Daily News, noted that [...] " [...] isn't taking any chances. This time around, her daring {{has more to do with}} music than lyrics", while also praising her vocals; [...] "If anything, her singing is the album's greatest strength. Madonna uses every trick from her repertoire. [...] Bedtime Stories turns in some of the strongest performances of her career. 'Madonna sings well' — <b>bet</b> <b>you</b> don't see that headline in the tabloids anytime soon". Chris Willman of the Los Angeles Times gave it two-stars-and-a-half out of four, writing that the album [...] "seems the least remarkable of all Madonna's albums. But it's not necessarily the least of them. [...] It has a nice, consistently relaxed feel, its slow jams hip-hop-inflected but not as self-consciously as last time".|$|E
