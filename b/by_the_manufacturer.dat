5|$|Despite Tahara's {{large-scale}} automation, Lexus LS production {{also involves}} specialized personnel who are tasked with key production points, such as testing each vehicle's V8 engine via dynamometer and stethoscope for calibration before installation. With the LS 460, a hand-sanded paint process was introduced. The production standards {{used on the}} Lexus LS were eventually adopted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> for other vehicles; in 2007, the assembly of Toyota Corolla economy cars used the same panel gap measurements as the LS 400 did eighteen years earlier.|$|E

5|$|External {{cleaning}} {{may also}} be required to remove contaminants, corrosion products or old paint or other coatings. Methods which remove the minimum amount of structural material are indicated. Solvents, detergents and bead blasting are generally used. Removal of coatings by the application of heat may render the cylinder unserviceable by affecting the crystalline microstructure structure of the metal. This is a particular hazard for aluminium alloy cylinders, {{which may not be}} exposed to temperatures above those stipulated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer.</b>|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization {{recommends}} that both {{adults and children}} reduce the intake of free sugars to less than 10% of total energy intake. A reduction to below 5% of total energy intake brings additional health benefits, especially in what regards dental caries (cavities in the teeth). These recommendations {{were based on the}} totality of available evidence reviewed regarding the relationship between free sugars intake and body weight and dental caries. Free sugars include monosaccharides and disaccharides added to foods and beverages <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer,</b> cook or consumer, and sugars naturally present in honey, syrups, fruit juices and fruit juice concentrates.|$|E

A typical modification involves the replacement of steel components of the vehicle with corrosion resistant aluminium or fibreglass, waterproofing any exposed electronic components, replacement of the stock hopper with a specially designed gritting body, {{the addition of a}} plow frame, reinforcement of the wheels, bumpers to support the heavy blade, and the addition of extra headlamps, a light bar, and retroreflectors for visibility.|$|E
5|$|Boeing {{issued a}} {{petition}} for bankruptcy 22 June 1971, which {{was carried out}} by Oslo District Court the following day. The two remaining Boeing aircraft were re-registered with Aer Lingus on 10 June. By late August the debt in the company had been assessed to NOK30 million, making it the largest bankruptcy till then in Norwegian history. The largest creditor was Boeing, which was owed NOK7 million. The creditors and shareholders lost all of their investments in the company because the airline's limited assets were used to pay outstanding wages. Tjøntveit stated on 8 September that he intended to sue Boeing for damages from the seizure of the aircraft, but by October no writ of summons had been received <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer.</b>|$|E
5|$|Operation {{proved to}} give several major difficulties, and by March 2001, Oslo Sporveier was {{threatening}} to terminate the purchase agreement unless the manufacturer—who by then had merged to become AnsaldoBreda—fixed the problems. These included the noise being 15dB too loud, and trams being out of service during the January–February cold spell, when batteries and rectifiers would not operate. It was agreed that AnsaldoBreda would have to replace all 256 motors to satisfy the criteria in the contract. By 1 June, AnsaldoBreda had delivered one tram that met all the contract's criteria. Tram 155 was by then still undelivered, and was being used for testing <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer.</b> At the same time, 149 was being used for tests in Oslo. The trams were taken out of service, and gradually put back as they were upgraded. In February 2002, tram 155 was equipped with new motors, and a new agreement was made where all motors would be replaced by December 2003, if Oslo Sporveier was satisfied with six months of trials with 155.|$|E

25|$|The pricing {{technique}} used by most retailers is cost-plus pricing. This involves adding a markup amount (or percentage) to the retailer's cost.

However, content of nutrients varied and depended on <b>the</b> <b>manufacturer</b> and <b>the</b> cheese flavour. Nutrient content claims were often different from the results obtained in our study: protein content resulted from this experiment was generally lower than declared <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>manufacturers</b> and obtained in our study fat content was higher than reported at the labels...|$|R
