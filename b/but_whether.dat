5|$|Longchamp's sister, Richeut, {{married the}} castellan of Dover Castle. A second sister, Melisend, came to England with Longchamp, but {{otherwise}} is unknown. A sister is recorded as having married Stephen Devereux, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> this is Melisend is unclear. Of Longchamp's brothers, Osbert remained a layman, and owed {{much of his}} advancement to William; Stephen served King Richard I on crusade; Henry, another layman, became a sheriff along with Osbert; and Robert became a monk. Two of Longchamp's brothers became abbots.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Peninsular War in Spain and the capture of the Spanish king Ferdinand VII generated a political crisis in the Spanish colonies in the Americas. The first project to maintain the monarchy was the short-lived Carlotism, which sought to crown Carlota Joaquina as regent. This project was supported by criollos like Manuel Belgrano and Juan Jos√© Castelli, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> Saavedra supported it is disputed. The Carlotism was abandoned soon afterwards, and the people sought other projects.|$|E

5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower jaw, and D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower jaw and two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E
5|$|Harold's {{body was}} {{identified}} {{the day after}} the battle, either through his armour or marks on his body. The English dead, who included some of Harold's brothers and his housecarls, were left on the battlefield. Gytha, Harold's mother, offered the victorious duke the weight of her son's body in gold for its custody, but her offer was refused. William ordered that Harold's body was to be thrown into the sea, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> that took place is unclear.

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether a building {{stood on the}} site of the citadel before the 11th century AD. The Ghouta, the wider area in which Damascus is located, has been occupied since at least 9000 BC, but there is no evidence for settlement within the area that is today enclosed by the city walls before the 1st millennium BC. The area occupied by the later citadel was most likely outside this first settlement. The presence of a citadel during the Hellenistic period {{is uncertain}}. Damascus certainly had a citadel during the Roman period, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> it was located {{on the site of}} the present citadel is uncertain and subject to scholarly debate.|$|E
5|$|Little {{literary}} evidence survives of {{the activities}} of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians.|$|E

After seven months Mercator was released for lack of evidence against him but others on the list suffered torture and execution: two men were burnt at the stake, another was beheaded and two women were entombed alive.|$|E

5|$|Rhegium owed {{its laws}} on epikleroi to Androdamas of Rhegium, a law-giver whose views {{on this subject}} were {{especially}} esteemed, according to Aristotle. In the city-state of Charondas' laws, an epikleros had {{to be given a}} dowry if her nearest kin did not wish to marry her. During the time of Alexander the Great, Tegean law deals with the inheritance of returning exiles, limiting them to inheriting only their paternal estate or an estate of their mother if she had become an epikleros while in exile. The city-states of Naupactus and Thermus allowed women to inherit property, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> or not the daughters were considered epikleroi is unknown from the surviving fragments of the laws from those cities.|$|E

5|$|Savaric first {{appears in}} the {{historical}} record in 1157 when he is named as a canon of Coutances Cathedral in Normandy. He then was archdeacon of Countances from 1162 to 1174. He was Treasurer of Salisbury in 1174 and archdeacon of Northampton from 1175 to 1187. The medieval chronicler Ralph Diceto says that a Savaric was appointed as Archdeacon of Canterbury, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> {{this was the same}} Savaric is unclear. He incurred large debts to King Henry II of England, which caused the king to complain to Pope Urban III. During the years 1182‚Äì1184, Savaric was deprived of his archdeaconries, which may have been connected to the debt issue with the king.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} the battle, Harold's body was identified, either by his armour or marks on his body.

The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} {{the fact that there was}} a carved king's head on the building, from a time when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> this represented King John or another king is not known.

5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped dentine island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E
5|$|Roger was {{the eldest}} brother of William, but died childless during their father's lifetime. The next son, John, {{inherited}} the family lands, but died around 1149 without children. William then inherited the lands. John and William had a sister called Margaret, {{who was the}} wife of Haimo de St Clair. Their father married a second time, and had a son named Simon by that marriage. William took his surname from his mother's family, as did his half-brother Simon, who {{was not related to}} the Chesney family except by marriage. Two further children of Robert's, Elias and Peter, are known, <b>but</b> <b>whether</b> they were the children of the first marriage or the second is unclear. Chesney should be distinguished from another William de Chesney, who controlled the town of Oxford and its castle as well as the town of Deddington and its castle in the same time period.|$|E
