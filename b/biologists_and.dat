5|$|Pre-conference {{tutorials}} {{have played}} an important role in ISMB since the first conference. Tutorials at ISMB 1994 included introductions to genetic algorithms, neural networks, AI for molecular <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> molecular biology for computer scientists. Tutorials on computational mass spectrometry-based proteomics and ENCODE data access were presented at ISMB/ECCB 2013.|$|E
5|$|Teleology {{in biology}} {{is the use}} of the {{language}} of goal-directedness in accounts of evolutionary adaptation, which some <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> philosophers of science find problematic. The term teleonomy has also been proposed. Teleology is the principle that some phenomena exist because they result in a goal being fulfilled. Before Darwin, organisms were seen as existing because God had designed and created them; their features such as eyes were taken by natural theology to have been made to enable them to carry out their functions, such as seeing. Evolutionary biologists often use similar teleological formulations that invoke purpose, but these imply natural selection rather than actual goals, whether conscious or not. Dissenting <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> religious thinkers held that evolution itself was somehow goal-directed (orthogenesis), and in vitalist versions, driven by a purposeful life force. Since such views are now discredited, with evolution working by natural selection acting on inherited variation, the use of teleology in biology has attracted criticism, and {{attempts have been made to}} teach students to avoid teleological language.|$|E
5|$|Years of {{cataloging}} by <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> {{park rangers}} have recorded 2000 species of insects, 8 reptiles, 169 birds, 48 mammals, and even one amphibian (the western toad). Birds and some rodents are seen most {{frequently in the}} Craters of the Moon area. Brown bears once roamed this area but have long ago become locally extinct. Traditional livestock grazing continues within the grass/shrublands administered by the BLM.|$|E

5|$|A {{nest box}} {{can also be}} {{regarded}} as an animal surveillance device. Surveilling animals {{can lead to the}} discovery of new scientific and industrial fields. For example, <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> engineers can work on barn owl surveillance techniques and devices, while social scientists document the practices that cause humans to observe an animal. While the diet of the barn owl has been studied, other areas like breeding success are not well known. Nest boxes provide direct physical access to the breeding location.|$|E
5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} the Laptev Sea is considered by some authorities, including many Russian <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> the canonical Mammal Species of the World, to be a third subspecies, O. r. laptevi (Chapskii, 1940), and is managed as such in Russia. Where the subspecies separation is not accepted, whether to consider it a subpopulation of the Atlantic or Pacific subspecies remained under debate until 2009, when multiple lines of molecular evidence showed it to represent the westernmost population of the Pacific walrus.|$|E
5|$|Many of Canberra's suburbs {{are named}} after former Prime Ministers, famous Australians, early settlers, or use Aboriginal words for their title. Street names {{typically}} follow a particular theme; for example, {{the streets of}} Duffy are named after Australian dams and reservoirs, the streets of Dunlop are named after Australian inventions, inventors and artists and the streets of Page are named after <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> naturalists. Most diplomatic missions {{are located in the}} suburbs of Yarralumla, Deakin and O'Malley. There are three light industrial areas: the suburbs of Fyshwick, Mitchell and Hume.|$|E

5|$|Between 1941 and 1942, American ornithologist Melbourne Armstrong Carriker {{collected}} 27 {{specimens of}} the Perijá tapaculo in six locations {{on the western}} side of the Serranía del Perijá. He identified them as specimens of the northern white-crowned tapaculo (S.atratus), despite size and colour differences, and sent them to the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. In 1953, the specimens began {{to attract the attention of}} <b>biologists,</b> <b>and</b> were successively identified as the brown-rumped tapaculo (S.latebricola), the Caracas tapaculo (S.caracae), and the Mérida tapaculo (S.meridanus). Some further believed that the specimens could belong to an undescribed species, or constitute a subspecies of the pale-bellied tapaculo (S.griseicollis) or the Mérida tapaculo based on morphological studies, but they were never classified as any of these.|$|E
5|$|Between 1985 and 2007, only {{an average}} of 18 sockeye salmon {{returned}} to Idaho each year. Serious conservation efforts by wildlife <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon, collected their sperm and eggs, and in a laboratory, have them spawn. Instead of spawning naturally, these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist's laboratory. These baby salmon then are transported by ship, bypassing the dams. (The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents, which suck the baby salmon down.) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover, is the destruction of old, outdated dams, such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River, {{a tributary of the}} Snake. After destroying the dam, salmon populations noticeably recovered.|$|E
5|$|The tribes {{involved}} benefited {{greatly from}} the decision. Prior to Boldt's ruling, Indians collected {{less than five}} percent (5%) of the harvest, but by 1984, they were collecting forty-nine percent (49%). Tribal members became successful commercial fishermen, even expanding to marine fishing {{as far away as}} Alaska. The tribes became co-managers of the fisheries along with the state, hiring fish <b>biologists</b> <b>and</b> staff to carry out those duties. The Makah tribe, based on the terms of the Neah Bay Treaty and the Boldt decision, took their first California gray whale in over seventy years in 1999. Following a lawsuit by various animal rights activists, the tribe was allocated the right to take up to five whales a year for the 2001 and 2002 seasons.|$|E
