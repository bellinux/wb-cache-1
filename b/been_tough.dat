500|$|Sommers felt [...] "almost 100 percent" [...] of the {{technology}} in the film would actually become available within 10 to 20 years, citing the various books and magazines about developing weapons that he loved reading. For example, Sommers said he believed invisibility was impossible, but the virtual invisibility provided by camouflage camera that projects the background of a soldier's body upon its front allowed him to include it. The production designers modelled the interior of Destro's private submarine on a Handley Page Jetstream. Sommers said the bulky immobile [...] "accelerator suits" [...] (which Beattie said had enabled them to write [...] "a car chase where one guy's not even in a car") had <b>been</b> <b>tough</b> on the actors and were likely to have their roles reduced in potential sequels. Critics have compared the suits to that of NFL SuperPro, a comic book character jointly licensed by the NFL and Marvel Comics, and resembling an armored football player.|$|E

McGregor also wanted to pursue modelling opportunities in Europe and he explained, [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>tough</b> [...] I didn't realise how many hours were involved, and I had to knock back so many modelling jobs." [...] McGregor shot his final scenes in late April 2011. McGregor said Mark's exit storyline would see him forced out of Ramsay Street. He explained, [...] "things get very difficult for Mark, and he's forced to make some tough decisions - both about his career and his feelings for Kate." [...] Mark's departure unfolded during a real time episode, which was broadcast on 22 June 2011. Mark was forced to go into witness protection after he was stalked and threatened for exposing corruption within the police force. In a twist to the storyline, Mark was later said to have been killed. McGregor believed Mark could return in the future, saying [...] "There have been plenty of other characters who've come back from the dead - but that's not to say I'd want to. But if Brennan ever does pop up again, I'd like to be asked first for the role." ...|$|E

In 2000 came relegation, and a year later Swindon avoided another 'double relegation' by just one point. A glimmer of hope came when the play-offs were reached in 2004 – ending in a semi-final loss to Brighton – but last term Town became the first club to drop into the bottom tier of the Football League having once been in the Premier League.

2500|$|While Clinton {{recognized}} some of {{the contradictions}} of U.S. policy towards turmoil in the Mideast countries, which involving backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others, she was nevertheless passionate on the subject, enough so that Obama joked at the annual Gridiron Dinner that [...] "I've dispatched Hillary to the Middle East {{to talk about how}} these countries can transition to new leaders—though, I've got to be honest, she's gotten a little passionate about the subject.

The key was her ability to fall asleep on demand, at any time and place, for power naps.|$|E
2500|$|Lucy Benjamin {{told the}} Daily Star that keeping the secret that her {{character}} {{was responsible for}} the attempted murder had been the [...] "worst two months of her life". She commented to The Mirror, [...] "For two months I've carried this secret and it's <b>been</b> <b>tough,</b> really hard. I've had to lie to my colleagues— all the suspects were told to say it wasn't us. I've become very good at lying! The lies went on and on. The first person I told that it wasn't me was Todd Carty, who plays Mark [...] I thought he was a good chap to try my lies on to see if he believed it! And he did. I was delighted that it was me. I think Lisa had every reason to do it". At the time, Lucy Benjamin expressed fear that the high-profile storyline would spell the end of her character, who she had thought would be imprisoned. However, in a further plot twist, Phil framed Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), for the shooting. Subsequent storylines involved in Lisa and Phil's narratives surrounded Lisa's pregnancy. In the storyline, Lisa, secretly expecting Phil's baby, married Mark Fowler (Todd Carty), and claimed the baby was his. This secret was blown in the Christmas Day 2001 episodes.|$|E

'No, for {{you were}} in the utmost parts of the earth; and he was very good, so that I don't believe honest Phyl herself, or any one without eyes, guessed it; but he had it all out with our father, who begged him, almost on that {{allegiance}} he had always shown, to abstain from beginning about it. You see, not only are they first cousins, but our mother and his father both were consumptive, and there was dear Claude even then regularly breaking down every winter, and Ada needing to be looked after like a hothouse plan. I'm sure, when I think of the last generation of Devereuxes, I wonder so many of us have <b>been</b> <b>tough</b> enough to weather the dangerous age; and there had been an alarm or two about Rotherwood himself. Well, he was very good, half from obedience, half from being convinced {{that it would be a}} selfish thing, and especially from being wholly convinced that Phyl's feelings were not stirred. That was the way I came to know about it, for papa took me out for a drive in the old gig to ask what I thought about her heart, and I could truly and honestly say she had never found it, cared for Rotherwood just as she did for Reggie, and was not the sort to think whether a man was attentive to her. Besides, she was eighteen, and he thirty-one, and she thought him venerable. I believe, if he had asked her then, she might have taken him (because Cousin Rotherwood wished it), but she would have had to fall in love in the second place instead of the first. Well, he was very good, poor old fellow, except that by way of taking himself off, and diverting his mind, he went dear-stalking with such unnecessary vehemence that a Scotch mist was very nearly the death of him, and he discovered that he had as many lungs as other people. If you could only have seen our dear old father then, how distressed and how guilty he felt, and how he used to watch Phyllis, and examine Alethea and me as to whether she seemed more than reasonably concerned for Rotherwood had come and hit the right nail on the head he might have carried her off.' ...|$|E
