40|$|The {{misalignment}} between {{corporate bond}} and {{credit default swap}} (CDS) spreads (i. e., CDSbond basis) during the 2007 - 09 financial crisis is often attributed to corporate bond dealers shedding off their inventory, right when liquidity was scarce. This paper documents evidence against this widespread perception. In the months following Lehman's collapse, dealers, including proprietary trading desks in investment banks, provided liquidity {{in response to the}} large selling by clients. Corporate bond inventory of dealers rose sharply as a result. Although providing liquidity, limits to arbitrage, possibly in the form of limited capital, obstructed the convergence of the basis. We further show that the unwinding of precrisis 'basis trades' by hedge funds is the main driver of the large negative <b>basis.</b> <b>Price</b> drops following Lehman's collapse were concentrated among bonds with available CDS contracts and high activity in basis trades. Overall, our results indicate that hedge funds that serve as alternative liquidity providers at times, not dealers, caused the disruption in the credit market...|$|E

The paper highlights {{that since the}} early 1990 s, Mali has made appreciable progress in reducing macroeconomic imbalances and liberalizing the economy. This has been made possible by consolidating the government fiscal position, lowering inflation, dismantling public monopolies, abolishing price controls, liberalizing the trade regime, and allowing for a greater role for private sector initiative. However, {{the pace of the}} country’s development remains constrained by a low level of human capital, inadequate infrastructure, and high energy and telecommunications costs.

40|$|Concentration in {{the packing}} {{industry}} {{has resulted in}} 5 major packers processing over 75 percent of the cattle on feed. During the last cattle cycle, total cattle numbers declined {{at the same time}} packers were increasing chain speeds and increasing individual plant volumes. From 1987 through 1992 the cow herd did not expand, therefore, supplies of fed cattle were consumed easily by existing packing facilities. All packers participated in the cash market to some extent, but in order to guarantee sufficient supplies of fed cattle in short supply situations, packers fed their own cattle, actively contracted cattle, and created marketing agreements priced on a formula <b>basis.</b> <b>Price</b> discovery of fed cattle became more difficult as more cattle were sold on contract or formula. The cash price is used in determining formula pricing but as the volume of cash cattle traded becomes smaller in relation to the volume of formula cattle, price reporting may become more unreliable. Another trend which has evolved during the last cattle cycle is the practice of buying cattle on averages. Cattle of varying degrees of quality sell at basically one price. Average to below average cattle benefit from this practice, but high grading, high cutability cattle are less likely to receive full value. Consequently, the benefits of good breeding programs are masked by this process of selling on the average. Much research has been done to establish the value differences of cutability. Yield grades have been used for many years to denote muscling. As consumer preferences for more lean and less fat grow, the value of cutability becomes more important. Table 1 was compiled by Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M. This table shows the value of yield grade differences with 1 inch, 1 / 2 inch, and 1 / 4 inch of outside fat trim. As more product is sold on a closely trimmed basis, the value of one full point of yield grade increases. For example, at one inch of trim, the value improvement of a yield grade 2 choice steer is 2. 52 per cwt of carcass over a yield grade 3 choice steer or approximately 20. 00 per head on an 800 pound carcass. When cut to 1 / 4 inch specifications, the value differences is 3. 88 per cwt of carcass or 31. 00 per head...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{analyses}} sawnwood {{supply in}} the Finnish sawmilling industry using the database approach. The analyses help to understand the supply and demand of sawnwood between customers and sawmills. In the analyses two databases were {{used to examine the}} supply of sawnwood. In addition, the following three criteria were used: 1) quantity, 2) price and 3) quality. The study focused on a sample of 63, 774 sales of over 19 million m 3 sawnwood from 1995 to 2000. Quality in the thesis is defined in terms of dimensions, quality classes, end moisture contents and user segments. The coniferous species in the sample were Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies). Additionally, time series data about the consumption of coniferous sawnwood from the years between 1961 and 2002 was used in the study. The most essential new result of the thesis was that the features of sawnwood as a commodity product were clear in the sample from 1995 to 2000. Nevertheless, the marketing and the operations of the Finnish sawmilling industry at the time emphasised the features related to special and customer products. In 2002, the global consumption of coniferous sawnwood (CSW) was 283 million m 3. The same year in Finland, the consumption of sawnwood increased to 1. 02  m 3 per capita, the highest in the world. Finland experienced a structural change in the sawnwood consumption between the periods of 1961 - 1996 and 1997 - 2002. From 1995 to 2000, sawnwood supply and sales from Finnish sawmills were largely limited to only a few volume dimensions. For pine, 20 % of the number of dimensions encompassed 91 % of volume and 90 % of value. For spruce, 20 % of the number of dimensions covered 82 % of volume and 83 % of value. The Pareto principle assumption applied to the distribution of sawnwood dimensions from the quantity (m 3) and value (€) perspectives. There was a sawnwood market trend towards smaller batch sizes. It was observed that the end moisture content class MC 18 % has a dominant position – over 90 % – in the end moisture content distribution. The results supported the view that sawnwood supply consists mainly of a limited number standard products. Dimensions had big differences specific to country and species of timber. The <b>basis</b> <b>price</b> system worked by dimension, quality class and species with a defined basis of pine 50  ×  150  mm U/S or similar. This system was used in the pricing of sawnwood in the Finnish sawmilling industry in 2000. In the analyses, the supply of sawnwood was divided according to end moisture content classes, countries, dimensions and segments. In the supply analyses, standard dimensions and qualities were linked with the standard moisture content classes as MC 18 %. The results showed that the supply was greatest for standardised sawnwood. The supply and demand for special qualities increased particularly for pine. There was a correlation between sawnwood export countries, moisture content classes and end-user segments. The results showed that sawnwood user segmentation was still unfinished. The thesis seeks to present such methods that give relevant information to sawmills and other segments of the forest cluster. These useful methods include logistic regressions and other statistical tools. Applying these tools can give new insight into business management as well as the dynamics of the demand for sawnwood and other wood products. reviewe...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with a new computational study of optimal investment decisions with proportional transaction costs or capital gain taxes over multiple periods. The decisions are studied for investors {{who have access to}} a risk-free asset and multiple risky assets to maximize the expected utility of terminal wealth. The risky asset returns are modeled by a discrete-time multivariate geometric Brownian motion. As in the model in Davis and Norman (1990) and Lynch and Tan (2010), the transaction cost is modeled to be proportional to the amount of transferred wealth. As in the model in Dammon et al. (2001) and Dammon et al. (2004), the taxation rule is linear, uses the weighted average tax <b>basis</b> <b>price,</b> and allows an immediate tax credit for a capital loss. For the transaction costs problem, we compute both lower and upper bounds for optimal solutions. We propose three trading strategies to obtain the lower bounds: the hyper-sphere strategy (termed HS); the hyper-cube strategy (termed HC); and the value function optimization strategy (termed VF). The first two strategies parameterize the associated no-trading region by a hyper-sphere and a hyper-cube, respectively. The third strategy relies on approximate value functions used in an approximate dynamic programming algorithm. In order to examine their quality, we compute the upper bounds by a modified gradient-based duality method (termed MG). We apply the new methods across various parameter sets and compare their results with those from the methods in Brown and Smith (2011). We are able to numerically solve problems up to the size of 20 risky assets and a 40 -year-long horizon. Compared with their methods, the three novel lower bound methods can achieve higher utilities. HS and HC are about one order of magnitude faster in computation times. The upper bounds from MG are tighter in various examples. The new duality gap is ten times narrower than the one in Brown and Smith (2011) in the best case. In addition, I illustrate how the no-trading region deforms when it reaches the borrowing constraint boundary in state space. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of the deformation in no-trading region shape resulted from the borrowing constraint. In particular, we demonstrate how the rectangular no-trading region generated in uncorrelated risky asset cases (see, e. g., Lynch and Tan, 2010; Goodman and Ostrov, 2010) transforms into a non-convex region due to the binding of the constraint. For the capital gain taxes problem, we allow wash sales and rule out "shorting against the box" by imposing nonnegativity on portfolio positions. In order to produce accurate results, we sample the risky asset returns from its continuous distribution directly, leading to a dynamic program with continuous decision and state spaces. We provide ingredients of effective error control in an approximate dynamic programming solution method. Accordingly, the relative numerical error in approximating value functions by a polynomial basis function is about 10 E- 5 measured by the l 1 norm and about 10 E- 10 by the l 2 norm. Through highly accurate numerical solutions and transformed state variables, we are able to explain the optimal trades through an associated no-trading region. We numerically show in the new state space the no-trading region has a similar shape and parameter sensitivity to that of the transaction costs problem in Muthuraman and Kumar (2006) and Lynch and Tan (2010). Our computational results elucidate the impact on the no-trading region from volatilities, tax rates, risk aversion of investors, and correlations among risky assets. To the best of our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} showing no-trading region of the capital gain taxes problem has such similar traits to that of the transaction costs problem. We also compute lower and upper bounds for the problem. To obtain the lower bounds we propose five novel trading strategies: the value function optimization (VF) strategy from approximate dynamic programming; the myopic optimization and the rolling buy-and-hold heuristic strategies (MO and RBH); and the realized Merton's and hyper-cube strategies (RM and HC) from policy approximation. In order to examine their performance, we develop two upper bound methods (VUB and GUB) based on the duality technique in Brown et al. (2009) and Brown and Smith (2011). Across various sets of parameters, duality gaps between lower and upper bounds are smaller than 3 % in most examples. We are able to solve the problem up to the size of 20 risky assets and a 30 -year-long horizon...|$|E
