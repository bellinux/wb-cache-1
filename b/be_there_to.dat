5|$|The {{party is}} {{strongly}} individualistic, wanting {{to reduce the}} power of the state and the public sector. It believes that the public sector should only <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> secure a minimum standard of living, and that individuals, businesses and organisations should take care of various tasks instead of the public sector, in most cases. The party also generally advocates the lowering of taxes, various duties, as well increased market economy.|$|E

As Fassl holds {{up a piece of}} paper to show it to the family who called for the repair, blood spatter splashes across the paper. He looks up and sees the house's occupants with slit throats in pools of blood. Abruptly, two police officers burst into the house and apprehend Fassl. One of the officers who goes to check out the kitchen turns to reveal he is John Doggett (Robert Patrick) as a young NYPD officer.|$|E

5|$|Samoa Joe and Booker T {{started a}} rivalry over the TNA World Heavyweight Championship {{following}} Slammiversary. On the June12 episode of Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat {{him at the}} event due to interference from Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match later in the broadcast. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road on July13 for the title. On the July10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed {{that he did not}} know which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> watch. At the event, Joe beat Booker T till he was bloody, causing several referees and security personnel to try to stop him to no avail. He was stopped when Sting interfered in the contest by bashing Joe with a baseball bat. Booker T then covered Joe for an unofficial pinfall victory that was counted by Booker T's legitimate wife Sharmell. The match result was ruled a no-contest, with Joe retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|Tess, {{awakening}} {{on a table}} {{inside a}} laboratory, is greeted by the parallel universe version of Lionel Luthor (John Glover), who reveals that Lex took his imperfect clones' best pieces and assembled them to create a perfect clone of himself. Lionel attempts to use Tess's heart to bring Lex back to life, but she breaks free and shoots Lionel during her escape. Lionel makes a deal with Darkseid to bring his son to life in exchange for Lionel's soul. Clark tracks Tess to the Luthor Mansion, where he is confronted by Lex. Clark apologizes {{for not being able}} to save Lex, but declares that he will always <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> stop him in the future. Oliver confronts Granny Goodness, Desaad, and Gordon Godfrey, dispatching them with three arrows. At LuthorCorp, Tess confronts Lex, who reveals that he always knew that she was his sister and that he used her. Lex embraces Tess, and stabs her in the stomach as he tells her he loves her, claiming to be saving her from becoming like him.

5|$|The {{main event}} at Victory Road {{was for the}} TNA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Samoa Joe and the {{challenger}} Booker T. Joe and Booker T previously fought at TNA's Slammiversary PPV event on June8 in a King of the Mountain match for the title, which Joe won to remain champion. On the June12 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Booker T claimed that Joe did not beat him at the event due to interference from Joe's mentor Kevin Nash. This led to Nash stating that Joe could not beat Booker T in a one-on-one match. After this segment, Joe announced that Booker T and he would face at Victory Road for the title. Since Houston is Booker T's hometown, TNA promoted the match as him attempting to win the championship {{for the people of}} Houston. On the July 10 episode of Impact!, Sting proclaimed {{that he did not know}} which of the two would win at Victory Road, but that he would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> watch.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} factor crucial to LRT is the train operator. Unlike rail rapid transit, which can travel unattended under {{automatic train operation}} (ATO), safe, high-quality LRT operation relies on a human operator as a key element. The reason that the operator is so important is because the train tracks often share the streets with automobiles, other vehicles, and pedestrians. If trains were fully automated on roads, nobody would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> stop the train if a car pulled in front of it. Light rail trains are actually very sturdily built for passenger safety, and to reduce damage from impacts with cars.|$|E
25|$|Anti-lock brakes are {{the subject}} of some {{experiments}} centred around risk compensation theory, which asserts that drivers adapt to the safety benefit of ABS by driving more aggressively. In a Munich study, half a fleet of taxicabs was equipped with anti-lock brakes, while the other half had conventional brake systems. The crash rate was substantially the same for both types of cab, and Wilde concludes this was due to drivers of ABS-equipped cabs taking more risks, assuming that ABS would take care of them, while the non-ABS drivers drove more carefully since ABS would not <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> help in case of a dangerous situation.|$|E

Whilst Smith edged towards 150, the hoped for wagging of the tail didn't emerge. Foster went early in the first session, and {{although}} the final two batsmen Angus Fraser and Nick Cook both absorbed a few overs each to help Smith move onto 143, neither really bothered the scorers, Fraser out for 2, and Cook was 0 not out when Smiths wicket finally fell, caught by Hohns off Merv Hughes. England all out for 260 early on day two.|$|E

25|$|The ICAC uses a three-pronged {{approach}} to combating corruption: investigation, prevention, and community education. The most high profile of aspect {{of its work}} has been its investigative work, however as important {{if not more so}} has been its work in prevention and education. Prevention wise the ICAC offers advice and practical help to enable companies and organisations to introduce systems and procedures that are resistant to corruption. Since its inception the ICAC has worked tirelessly to change the public's perception that bribes and kickbacks are an expected and normal part of everyday life, and to reassure citizens that if they face a demand for an illegal payment that the ICAC will <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> investigate.|$|E
25|$|In India, Ganesh Savarkar had {{organised}} {{an armed}} {{revolt against the}} Morley-Minto reforms of 1909. The British police implicated Savarkar in the investigation for allegedly plotting the crime. Hoping to evade arrest, Savarkar moved to Madame Cama's home in Paris. He was nevertheless arrested by police on 13 March 1910. In {{the final days of}} freedom, Savarkar wrote letters to a close friend planning his escape. Knowing that he would most likely be shipped to India, Savarkar asked his friend to keep track of which ship and route he would be taken through. When the ship SS Morea reached the port of Marseille on 8 July 1910, Savarkar escaped from his cell through a porthole and dived into the water, swimming to the shore in the hope that his friend would <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> receive him in a car. But his friend was late in arriving, and the alarm having been raised, Savarkar was re-arrested.|$|E
25|$|Eight weeks later, Alison {{experiences}} {{morning sickness}} {{during an interview}} with James Franco and realizes she could be pregnant. She contacts Ben {{for the first time}} since their one-night stand to tell him. Although insensitive at first, Ben says he will <b>be</b> <b>there</b> <b>to</b> support Alison. While he is still unsure about being a parent, his father (Harold Ramis) is excited. Alison's mother (Joanna Kerns) tries to persuade her daughter to have an abortion, but Alison decides to keep the child. Later, Alison and Ben decide to give their relationship a chance. The couple's efforts include Ben making an awkward marriage proposal with an empty ring box, promising to get her one someday. Alison thinks it's too early to think about marriage, because she is more concerned with hiding the pregnancy from her bosses, believing that they will fire her if they ever found out. After a somewhat promising beginning, tensions surface in the relationship.|$|E
