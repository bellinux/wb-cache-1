Some board members argue that a vote of no confidence would {{make it impossible for}} him to stay in the job." [...] By Wednesday, May 16, 2007, The New York Times, reported that [...] "after six weeks of fighting efforts to oust him as president ... Wolfowitz began today to negotiate the terms of his possible resignation, in return for the bank dropping or softening the charge that he had engaged in misconduct ..." [...] After expressions from the Bush administration that it [...] "fully" [...] supported Wolfowitz as World Bank president and its urging a [...] "fair hearing" [...] for him, President Bush expressed [...] "regret" [...] at Wolfowitz's impending resignation.|$|E
