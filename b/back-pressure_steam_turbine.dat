40|$|Abstract This {{report is}} the result of an {{examination}} work at the University of Karlstad. The purpose of this project is to examine how the condition of the steam affects the efficiency of the steam consumers and how variations in that condition affect a pulp and paper mill. This report is meant to describe the main components regarding steam production, steam conditioning and steam consumption. It should also be able to give basic information about the significance of steam conditioning in the pulp and paper industry. It is aimed to people working with steam conditioning to increase their understanding and knowledge about it. The aim of this report is to: • Describe the function of the most commonly used steam generators and the difference between these. • Identify the main steam consumers and describe their function. • Give an introduction to steam conditioning and its role at a pulp and paper mill. This report will try to answer the following questions: • How does the generated power from <b>back-pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> vary with grade of superheat of outlet steam? • What are the advantages with steam conditioning? • Are the steam conditioners at Gruvöns bruk able to deliver steam at the right condition? The conclusions from this report are that; • If the steam conditioning valves are able to reduce small steam flows to the correct temperature, more power can be produced. The design condition of the <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> can than be nearer saturation. • The temperature variations are more critical at the turbine inlet than downstream the steam conditioning valves.

40|$|The Puna Geothermal Venture (PGV) Project is a 25 MW (net) {{powerplant}} {{and associated}} geothermal well field {{proposed for the}} Puna District of the Island of Hawaii. The project, located in the Kapoho section of the Kilauea Lower East Rift Geothermal Resources Subzone, will sell the generated electricity to the Hawaii Electric Light Company (HELCO) for the Island of Hawaii. Since the proposed project is located within {{an area where the}} designated Geothermal Resources Subzone underlies an agricultural state land use district, the project requires a Geothermal Resource Permit from the County of Hawaii. The PGV Project is consistent with the stated objectives of providing energy self-sufficiency and diversifying Hawaii's economic base. The project will develop a new alternate energy source as well as provide additional information {{about the nature of the}} geothermal resource. These objectives are included in Hawaii's State Plan, the State Energy Functional Plan, and the County of Hawaii General Plan. On December 10, 1986, Thermal Power Company (TPC), as then operator of the Puna Geothermal Venture partnership, submitted anapplication to the Hawaii County Planning Department (HCPD) for a Geothermal Resource Permit (GRP) for the PGV Project. TPC also requested that the HCPD be the accepting agency for an Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) that TPC would voluntarily prepare and submit for the PGV Project. Although the HCPD determined that there were no clear requirements for preparation of an EIS, the HCPD agreed to act as accepting agency for the EIS and deferred acceptance of the PGV Project GRP application until after acceptance of the ElS. The Final ElS for the PGV Project was accepted on December 28, 1987, although the Hawaii County Planning Director again noted that the PGV Project did not require the filing of an ElS. However, further processing of the GRP application has not occurred because the entire interest inthe PGV partnership was purchased during the first half of 1988 by AMOR VI Corporation and AMOR VIII Corporation (AMOR Corporations), two wholly-owned subsidiaries of Ormat Energy Systems, Inc. of Sparks, Nevada. Since the purchase, PGV has reviewed the previous design of the PGV Project to determine if it remains entirely appropriate. As a result of this design review, PGV has decided to alter several aspects of the previously proposed PGV Project design to optimize production operations and further reduce the potential for environmental impacts. Principal among these proposed changes is the use in the power plant of <b>back-pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbines,</b> in combination with air-cooled binary cycle turbines, in place ofthe <b>steam</b> <b>turbines</b> and cooling towers proposed by TPC. This currently proposed power plant configuration applies a closed cycle for the geothermal fluid, thus essentially eliminating hydrogen sulfide emissions during normal operations and eliminating the need for cooling towers. Most other environmental impacts from this revised PGV Project will be very similar to those of the previously proposed PGV Project because the revised PGV Project will use the same geothermal resource, the same geothermal wellpads, and the same power plant location as the previously proposed PGV Project. This amendment to the GRP application has been prepared to replace, in its entirety, the GRP application submitted to the Hawaii County Planning Department in December, 1986. For clarity sake, Chapter 2 of this application is a summary description of the revised PGV Project, drawing comparisons with the previously proposed PGV Project, as appropriate. A more detailed description of the revised PGV Project follows in Chapter 3, organized to follow the requirements of Rule 12, Geothermal Resource Permits, of the county of Hawaii Planning Commission Rules of Practice and Procedure. As required by Rule 12, Chapter 3 of this amended application also summarizes the PGV Project potential environmental impacts and mitigation measures.

40|$|Most of the {{released}} CO 2 on {{offshore oil}} and gas installation originates from the gas turbines that power the installations. For certain offshore installations, CO 2 capture and storage (CCS) could be an alternative to decrease the CO 2 emissions. When opting for a chemical absorption CO 2 capture system, a heat source for the stripper reboiler is needed. Since most offshore installations are powered by simple cycle GTs, there is typically no steam available {{that could be used}} for stripper reboiler heat. A compact steam bottoming cycle could, in addition to providing the reboiler steam, partly or fully provide power from a steam turbine generator to the equipment in the CCS system, including CO 2 compressors, pumps, and flue gas booster fan. Three different steam cycle configurations were designed, modeled, and simulated. The design of the post-combustion CO 2 capture system is also presented but the main focus in the paper is on the steam cycle design.

Annual average process steam and electricity demands {{in the existing}} mill are 19. 3 MMBtu per ADST and 687 kWh per ADST, respectively. This is relatively high by industry standards. The mill meets nearly all its electricity needs with a <b>back-pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbine.</b> Higher electricity to heat ratios is an industry wide trend and anticipated at the mill. The potential for self-sufficiency in energy using only black liquor and bark available on-site is assessed based on {{the analysis of the}} present energy situation and potential process changes. The analysis here suggests that steam and electricity demand could be reduced by 89 % by operating consistently at high production rates. Process modifications and retrofits using commercially proven technologies could reduce steam and electricity demand to as low as 9. 7 MMBtu per ADST, a 50 % reduction, and 556 kWh per ADST, a 19 % reduction, respectively. Electricity demand could increase to about 640 kWh per ADST due to closed-cycle operation of the bleach plant and other efforts to improve environmental performance. The retrofitted energy efficient mill with low environmental impact could be self-sufficient in steam and electricity using conventional technology, such as a back pressure steam turbine or a condensing extraction steam turbine.

40|$|AbstractSustainable {{development}} requires combining {{economic viability}} with energy and environment conservation and ensuring social benefits. It is conceptualized that for designing a micro industry for sustainable rural industrialization, all these aspects should be integrated right up front. The concept includes; (a) utilization of local produce for value addition in {{a cluster of}} villages and enhancing income of the target population; (b) use of renewable energy and total utilization of energy generated by co and trigeneration (combining electric power production with heat utilization for heating and cooling); (c) conservation of water and complete recycling of effluents; (d) total utilization of all wastes for achieving closure towards a zero waste system. Enhanced economic viability and sustainability is achieved by integration of appropriate technologies into the industrial complex. To prove the concept, a model Micro Industrial Complex (MIC) {{has been set up}} in a semi arid desert region in Rajasthan, India at village Malunga in Jodhpur district. A biomass powered boiler and steam turbine system is used to generate 100 - 200 KVA of electric power and high energy steam for heating and cooling processes downstream. The unique feature of the equipment is a 100 - 150 kW <b>back-pressure</b> <b>steam</b> <b>turbine,</b> utilizing 3 - 4 tph (tonnes per hour) steam, developed by M/s IB Turbo. The biomass boiler raises steam at about 20 barg 3 tph, which is passed through a turbine to yield about 150 kW of electrical power. The steam let out at a back pressure of 1 - 3 barg has high exergy and this is passed on as thermal energy (about 2 MW), for use in various applications depending on the local produce and resources. The biomass fuel requirement for the boiler is 0. 5 - 0. 75 tph depending on its calorific value. In the current model, the electricity produced is used for running an oil expeller to extract castor oil and the castor cake is used as fuel in the boiler. The steam is used in a Multi Effect Distillation (MED) unit for drinking water production and in a Vapour Absorption Machine (VAM) for cooling, for banana ripening application. Additional steam is available for extraction of herbs such as mint and processing local vegetables. In this paper, we discuss the financial and economic viability of the system and show how the energy, water and materials are completely recycled and how the benefits are directed to the weaker sections of the community...|$|E
