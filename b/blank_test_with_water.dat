40|$|Static leach {{tests were}} {{performed}} in both 304 L stainless steel and Teflon vessels using a synthetic high-level waste glass <b>with</b> either deionized <b>water</b> (DIW) or a tuff groundwater solution as the leachant {{to assess the}} effects of the vessel and the initial leachant composition on the extent and nature of the glass reaction. The tests were performed using monolith samples at 340 m{sup {minus} 1 } and crushed samplesat 2000 m{sup {minus} 1 } for times up to 1 year. The results show less silicon is released from the glass into the groundwater solution than into DIW at both high and low glass surface area/leachant volume ratios (SAN), but the alkali metal and boron releases are not affected by the leachant used. Tests performed in a stainless steel vessel resulted in slightly lower leachate pH values, but similar reaction rates to those performed in a Teflon vessel, as measured by the boron release. <b>Blank</b> <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> DIW or EJ- 13 in the vessels showed the Teflon vessels to release small amounts of fluoride (1 to 2 ppm) and to acidify the DIW slightly (4. 0 < pH < 5. 6). The pH values of <b>blank</b> <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> EJ- 1 3 increased from 8. 2 to about 8. 6 in steel and to about 9. 2 in Teflon vessels. The slightly higher pH values attained in Teflon vessels are attributed to outgassing of CO{sub 2 } during the test...|$|R

40|$|Sweetpotato flours {{vary widely}} in color {{depending}} on genotype, and {{when used in}} wheat-based composite flours, they will impart characteristic colors which may be favorable or unfavorable for particular food products. Sweetpotato flour (SPF) was prepared from 44 genotypes and analyzed for proximate composition and biochemical properties. The Hunter Color L*, a*, b* values of the dry SPF and their modified Pekar slicks (PS) <b>with</b> <b>water</b> and <b>with</b> alkali were measured. Polyphenol oxidase activity, α-amylase activity, and total sugar were significantly correlated to L* values of dry SPF and of their PS <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> and <b>with</b> alkali. The yellow pigment level was significantly correlated to the yellowness (b*) of the dry flour and of the PS <b>test</b> <b>with</b> <b>water,</b> but less correlated to b* of the PS <b>test</b> <b>with</b> alkaline. The results indicated a complex biochemical basis to SPF color, and no single biochemical factor examined was adequate to predict {{the color of a}} food product made from SPF. However, the PS color parameters were highly correlated with the color of dough sheets for white-salted and yellow-alkaline noodles made from wheast and sweetpotato composite flour (75 : 25). Thus, the simple modified PS test could be used in screening of genotypes for color stability and suitability for a specific end-use. SPF genotypes conferred a wide range of colors on composite flour dough preparations. Some colors, particularly the range of greens and bright orange, may be useful in specialty product development. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

The rats also preferred a saccharin + sucrose mixture to sucrose, but sucrose to a sucralose + sucrose mixture. There were marked {{individual differences in}} sucralose preferences: about half the rats preferred sucralose to water at some concentrations while most remaining rats avoided sucralose.

Sewage sludges are formed in {{wastewater}} treatment plants as solid residues after water purification, therefore they have antropogenic origine.

Utilisation of sediments and sewage sludges as material for recultivation or a natural fertilizer is currently supported. But after application to the land, contaminants can be released to the environment. The consideration of ecotoxicological effects of sediments and sewage sludges is very important.

40|$|Plasma etched and {{simultaneously}} randomly roughened (nanotextured) polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) substrates show hierarchical roughness and complex high-aspect-ratio morphology. Here, they are investigated as superamphiphobic surfaces, after plasma deposition of a thin fluorocarbon film. Inspired {{by the need}} to allow their ""real world"" use, we explore two major stability issues of such superamphiphobic surfaces: (i) the structural stability of the nanotexture against capillary and adhesion forces during successive wetting-drying cycles, and (ii) the thermodynamic stability (robustness) of these surfaces related to the maximum sustainable pressure of the Cassie-Baxter inhomogeneous wetting state. We show that surfaces etched in oxygen plasma up to 4 min (with texture height ≈ 600 nm) are stable against successive wetting-drying cycles, while surfaces treated for longer time show highly porous nanofibrous morphology which is coalesced and stabilized upon wetting, allowing their potential long-term use. Robust superhydrophobic and superoleophobic behavior is observed in drop compression <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> (on 2, 4, 10 min plasma etched surfaces) and diiodomethane (on 4 and 10 min plasma etched surfaces), respectively, and no wetting transition is observed for these two liquids even at maximum drop compression possible (1. 5 kPa). Robust oleophobic behavior with sticky surfaces is observed for 1 and 2 min etching and with diiodomethane without transition to wetted states even upon maximum compression. On the contrary, wetting transition is observed for soya oil upon repeated compression. High-Aspect-Ratio polymeric nanowires (nanotexture) are formed on polymer surfaces as a result of plasma etching. We overcome their fragility by coalescence after water immersion/drying, and hydrophobize them with a plasma-deposited fluorocarbon layer. Reversible, robust superamphiphobic behavior is observed in drop compression <b>tests</b> <b>with</b> <b>water</b> and diiodomethane at maximum compression possible.
