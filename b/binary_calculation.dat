This X-ray source is of {{particular}} interest as it is currently the best candidate for an intermediate mass black hole; it is associated with a 54 mHz quasi-periodic oscillation with a relatively low (~ 1 keV) blackbody temperature. We perform detailed <b>binary</b> evolution <b>calculations</b> of 2 - 15 Msolar stars which transfer mass to a 100 - 2000 Msolar black hole and present an empirical model for the X-ray characteristics expected for such binaries.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of the light-variation amplitudes, A(a), in addition to determining the number of undiscovered contact binary systems falling below photometric detection thresholds and thus lost to statistics, {{can serve as a}} tool in determination of the massratio distribution, Q(q), which is very important for understanding of the evolution of contact <b>binaries.</b> <b>Calculations</b> of the expected A(a) show that it tends to converge to a mass-ratio dependent constant value for a → 0. Strong dependence of A(a) on Q(q) can be used to determine the latter distribution, but the technique is limited by the presence of unresolved visual companions and by blending in crowded areas of the sky. The bright-star sample to 7. 5 magnitude is too small for an application of the technique while the the Baade’s Window sample from the OGLE project may suffer stronger blending; thus the present results are preliminary and illustrative only.

40|$|Type Iax supernovae (SNe Iax) are {{proposed}} as one new sub-class of SNe Ia since they present observational properties that are sufficiently {{distinct from the}} bulk of SNe Ia. SNe Iax {{are the most common}} of all types of peculiar SNe by both number and rate, with an estimated rate of occurrence of about 5 - 30 % of the total SN Ia rate. However, the progenitor systems of SNe Iax are still uncertain. Analyzing pre-explosion images at SN Iax positions provides a direct way to place strong constraints on the nature of progenitor systems of SNe Iax. In this work, we predict pre-explosion properties of binary companion stars in a variety of potential progenitor systems by performing detailed <b>binary</b> evolution <b>calculations</b> with the one-dimensional stellar evolution code STARS. This will be helpful for constraining progenitor systems of SNe Iax from their pre-explosion observations.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} {{suggest that}} some type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) originate from the merging of two carbon-oxygen white dwarfs (CO WDs). Meanwhile, recent hydrodynamical simulations have indicated that the accretion-induced collapse may be avoided under certain conditions when double WDs merge violently. However, the properties of SNe Ia from this violent merger scenario are highly dependent on a particular mass-accretion stage, the so-called WD + He subgiant channel, during which the primary WD is able to increase its mass by accreting He-rich material from a He subgiant before the systems evolves into a double WD system. In this article, we aim to study this particular evolutionary stage systematically and give the properties of violent WD mergers. By employing the Eggleton stellar evolution code, we followed {{a large number of}} <b>binary</b> <b>calculations</b> and obtained the regions in parameter space for producing violent mergers based on the WD + He subgiant channel. According to these simulations, we found that the primary WDs can increase their mass by ~ 0. 10 - 0. 45 Msun during the mass-accretion stage. We then conducted a series of <b>binary</b> population synthesis <b>calculations</b> and found that the Galactic SN Ia birthrate from this channel is about 0. 01 - 0. 4 * 10 - 3 yr- 1. This suggests that the violent WD mergers from this channel may only contribute to ~ 0. 3 %- 10 % of all SNe Ia in our Galaxy. The delay times of violent WD mergers from this channel are > 1. 7 Gyr, contributing to the SNe Ia in old populations. We also found that the WD + He subgiant channel is the dominent way for producing violent WD mergers that may be able to eventually explode as SNe Ia.

40|$|It {{has long}} been a concern that {{performance}} measures of species distribution models react to attributes of the modeled entity arising from the input data structure rather than to model performance. Thus, the study of Allouche et al. (Journal of Applied Ecology, 43, 1223, 2006) identifying the true skill statistics (TSS) as being independent of prevalence had a great impact. However, empirical experience questioned the validity of the statement. We searched for technical reasons behind these observations. We explored possible sources of prevalence dependence in TSS including sampling constraints and species characteristics, which influence the calculation of TSS. We also examined whether the widespread solution of using the maximum of TSS for comparison among species introduces a prevalence effect. We found that the design of Allouche et al. (Journal of Applied Ecology, 43, 1223, 2006) was flawed, but TSS is indeed independent of prevalence if model predictions are binary and under the strict set of assumptions methodological studies usually apply. However, if we take realistic sources of prevalence dependence, effects appear even in <b>binary</b> <b>calculations.</b> Furthermore, in the widespread approach of using maximum TSS for continuous predictions, the use of the maximum alone induces prevalence dependence for small, but realistic samples. Thus, prevalence differences need {{to be taken into account}} when model comparisons are carried out based on discrimination capacity. The sources we identified can serve as a checklist to safely control comparisons, so that true discrimination capacity is compared as opposed to artefacts arising from data structure, species characteristics, or the calculation of the comparison measure (here TSS). © 2017 The Authors.

40|$|There is {{gathering}} indirect evidence suggesting non-conservative evolutions in Algols. However, the systemic mass-loss rate is poorly constrained by observations and generally set {{as a free}} parameter in binary-star evolution simulations. Moreover, systemic mass loss may lead to observational signatures that are still to be found. We investigate {{the impact of the}} outflowing gas and the possible presence of dust grains on the spectral energy distribution (SED). We used the 1 D plasma code Cloudy and compared the results with the 3 D Monte-Carlo radiative transfer code Skirt for dusty simulations. The circumbinary mass-distribution and binary parameters are computed with state-of-the-art <b>binary</b> <b>calculations</b> done with the Binstar evolution code. The outflowing material reduces the continuum flux-level of the stellar SED in the optical and UV. Due to the time-dependence of this effect, it may help to distinguish between different ejection mechanisms. Dust, if present, leads to observable infrared excesses even with low dust-to-gas ratios and traces the cold material at large distances from the star. By searching for such dust emission in the WISE catalogue, we found a small number of Algols showing infrared excesses, among which the two rather surprising objects SX Aur and CZ Vel. We find that some binary B[e] stars show the same strong Balmer continuum as we predict with our models. However, direct evidence of systemic mass loss is probably not observable in genuine Algols, since these systems no longer eject mass through the hotspot mechanism. Furthermore, owing to its high velocity, the outflowing material dissipates in a few hundred years. If hot enough, the hotspot may produce highly ionised species such as SiIV and observable characteristics that are typical of W Ser systems.

40|$|The {{progenitor}} {{problem of}} Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) is still unsolved. Most {{of these events}} {{are thought to be}} explosions of carbon-oxygen (CO) white dwarfs (WDs), but for many of the explosion scenarios, particularly those involving the externally triggered detonation of a sub-Chandrasekhar mass WD (sub-M Ch WD), there is also a possibility of having an oxygen-neon (ONe) WD as progenitor. We simulate detonations of ONe WDs and calculate synthetic observables from these models. The results are compared with detonations in CO WDs of similar mass and observational data of SNe Ia. We perform hydrodynamic explosion simulations of detonations in initially hydrostatic ONe WDs for a range of masses below the Chandrasekhar mass (M Ch), followed by detailed nucleosynthetic postprocessing with a 384 -isotope nuclear reaction network. The results are used to calculate synthetic spectra and light curves, which are then compared with observations of SNe Ia. We also perform <b>binary</b> evolution <b>calculations</b> to determine the number of SNe Ia involving ONe WDs relative to the number of other promising progenitor channels. The ejecta structures of our simulated detonations in sub-M Ch ONe WDs are similar to those from CO WDs. There are, however, small systematic deviations in the mass fractions and the ejecta velocities. These lead to spectral features that are systematically less blueshifted. Nevertheless, the synthetic observables of our ONe WD explosions are similar to those obtained from CO models. Our <b>binary</b> evolution <b>calculations</b> show that a significant fraction (3 - 10 %) of potential progenitor systems should contain an ONe WD. The comparison of our ONe models with our CO models of comparable mass (1. 2 Msun) shows that the less blueshifted spectral features fit the observations better, although they are too bright for normal SNe Ia.
