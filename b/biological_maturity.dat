Anthropometric data in Table  5 show that height and weight values were significantly larger in elite elementary and junior high school players than in recreational elementary and junior high school players, while height and weight are generally related to each other. This suggests that <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> occurs earlier in elite elementary and junior high school players than in recreational elementary and junior high school players. An important point regarding our anthropometric data was that the height was almost the same between recreational and elite high school players, indicating that the status of <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> evens out in high school. Recently, Müller et al.

A RAE was present in the total sample (χ 2 = 67. 81; p < 0. 001), and among both male (χ 2 = 49. 02; p < 0. 001) and female athletes (χ 2 = 37. 00; p < 0. 001) as well as for strength- (χ 2 = 56. 46; p < 0. 001), endurance- (χ 2 = 20. 48; p = 0. 039) and technique-related types of sports (χ 2 = 20. 48; p = 0. 041). No significant differences in <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> status were present between the male athletes of single relative age quarters. Among the female athletes a significant difference was present (F = 5. 94, p < 0. 001); relatively younger female athletes had significantly lower values in the APHV, which indicated that they were maturing earlier. However, when dividing the athletes into normal, early and late maturing athletes, it could be seen that among the relatively younger athletes, hardly any late maturing athletes were present. These findings revealed that relatively younger athletes seemed to only have a chance for selection if they were early maturing, whereas relatively older athletes had an increased likelihood for selection independent of their <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> status.

40|$|The 39 +/- 2 Ma Haughton impact {{structure}} on Devon Island comprises a thick target succession of sedimentary rocks, mainly carbonates. The carbonates contain pre-impact organic matter, including fossil biological markers. Haughton {{is located in}} an area where no major thermal event has affected the sedimentary succession after heating caused by impact. This makes Haughton uniquely suitable for studies concerning the preservation of fossil biological markers following an impact event. Melt breccia is the most common impactite at Haughton. It is composed of clasts of the target, mainly carbonates, embedded in a fine groundmass. The groundmass is composed of material that was melted during impact. In this study, fossil <b>biological</b> marker <b>maturity</b> parameters (tricyclic terpane-hopane ratio and pregnane-sterane ratio) and an aromatic maturity parameter [methylphenanthrene ratio (MPR) ] were used to compare the degree of thermal alteration in different size fractions of carbonate clasts (&# 60; 0. 5 - 4 cm in diameter) and between edges and centers of large carbonate clasts (15 - 20 cm in diameter). The data show that fossil biological markers can be preserved and detected in isolated large and small fractions of carbonate clasts that are embedded in an impact melt. The results also indicate that there is a thermal gradient from the center of a clast {{to the edge of a}} clast, which suggests that biological markers are more likely to be found preserved in the center of a clast.

40|$|The {{relative}} {{age effect}} (RAE) is a well-documented phenomenon in youth sports. This effect exists when the relative age quarter distribution of selected athletes shows a biased distribution with an over-representation of relatively older athletes. In alpine ski racing, {{it exists in}} all age categories (national youth levels up to World Cup). Studies so far could demonstrate that selected ski racers are relatively older, taller and heavier. It could be hypothesized that relatively younger athletes nearly only have a chance for selection if they are early maturing. However, surprisingly this influence of the <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> status on the RAE could not be proven, yet. Therefore, {{the aim of the}} present study was to investigate the influence of the <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> status on the RAE in dependence of the level of competition. The study investigated 372 elite youth ski racers: 234 provincial ski racers (P-SR; high level of competition) and 137 national ski racers (N-SR; very high level of competition). Anthropometric characteristics were measured to calculate the age at peak height velocity (APHV) as an indicator of the <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> status. A significant RAE was present among both P-SR and N-SR, with a larger effect size among the latter group. The N-SR significantly differed in APHV from the P-SR. The distribution of normal, early and late maturing athletes significantly differed from the expected normal distribution among the N-SR, not among the P-SR. Hardly any late maturing N-SR were present; 41. 7 % of the male and 34 % of the female N-SR of the last relative age quarter were early maturing. These findings clearly demonstrate the significant influence of the <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> status on the selection process of youth alpine ski racing in dependence of the level of competition.

The batch model describes the influence of one source of biological variation, here assumed to be variation in light conditions during the pre-harvest period, on the variation of precursor concentrations. The batch model consists of a kinetic part, describing the behaviour of the precursor for individuals, and a stochastic part, describing the precursor variation. The stochastic part is generic, but the kinetic part depends on the processes that determine keeping quality. The batch model is tested and validated using colour data of two sets of cucumber batches. Applying a previously developed cucumber colour model [Postharvest Biol.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome {{has become a}} major public health challenge world-wide and, at least in the industrialized world, the prevalence of the {{metabolic syndrome}} is increasing. There is evidence to show that biological and lifestyle risk factors for metabolic syndrome are present in adolescence, which suggests that the antecedents of the disease may lie in early life. The period of adolescence is characterized by a decline in physical activity (PA; lack of PA is a lifestyle risk factor for metabolic syndrome) and an increase in fat mass deposition (a biological risk factor for metabolic syndrome). Therefore, investigating how the development of these two variables relates to adult cardiometabolic risk is important to fuel early intervention. A factor which has the potential to influence these two risk factors, and thus ultimately the metabolic syndrome, is the timing of <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> (i. e. whether an individual is early, average or late maturing when compared to peers of the same age). The influence of <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> has largely been overlooked in previous research; therefore, the general objective of this thesis was to investigate the associations between <b>biological</b> <b>maturity,</b> adolescent PA and fat mass development, and young adult cardiometabolic risk. Three studies were necessary to realize this objective, and together help to elucidate the role of <b>biological</b> <b>maturity</b> in the adolescent decline in physical activity, fat development, and the development of adult metabolic syndrome. Ultimately, this information will aid in {{the development and implementation of}} interventions to decrease prevalence of metabolic syndrome.

Age at peak height velocity (APHV), an indicator of somatic maturity, was predicted and individuals aligned by this biological age (years from APHV).

Several spawning areas have been identified in this area indicating that there are several herring populations in the area such that the fishery exploits a stock-complex. Several <b>biological</b> characteristics including <b>maturity</b> rate, growth and feeding were examined. A comparison of growth rates from samples taken at two spawning sites and from the fall fishery did not indicate any differences and the populations were, therefore, treated as a unit stock for an analysis of its population dynamics.

40|$|Background : Adolescent is {{a period}} of {{transition}} between child and adult stage known as puberty. Developments in adolescents include physical, psychological and sexual maturation function. Changes due to <b>biological</b> sexual <b>maturity</b> experienced by adolescents {{is one of the things}} that can lead to confusion in the face of adolescent sex drive. One of the ways in which young people to channel their sexual impulse is to masturbate. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the factors associated with adolescent masturbatory behavior in high school in the District of North Indralaya in 2010. Method : This study used a cross sectional study. Sampling in this study conducted by proportional random sampling technique that high school students who will be sampled in each school selected proportionally based on the total desired sample as many as 84 students. Factors studied were variable attitudes, the role of parents, the perception of control behavior and masturbatory behavior in adolescents. The data is processed using a computerized system and then analyzed using univariate and bivariate statistical test Chi-Square. Result : The results showed that 57, 1 % of respondents have a negative attitude, 44, 0 % of respondents have parents who do not participate, 29, 8 % of respondents have a perception of bad behavior control and 27, 4 % of respondents having masturbation abnormal behavior. From the results of Chi-Square test showed that there was a significant correlation between attitude (p-value = 0, 031, RP = 3, 7; CI 95 %: 1, 2 - 11, 3)), the roles of parents (p-value = 0, 031, RP = 3, 3; CI 95 %: 1, 2 - 9, 1)), and perception of behavioral control (p-value = 0, 013, RP = 4, 0; CI 95 %: 1, 4 - 11, 2)) with the behavior of masturbation in adolescents. Conclusion : These three independent variables (attitudes, the role of parents, and perceptions of behavioral control) were significantly associated with the dependent variable (the behavior of adolescent masturbation) ...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Sc.) [...] Memorial University of Newfoundland, 1980. BiologyBibliography: leaves 78 - 82. Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus harengus L.) {{occurring}} {{along the}} west coast of Newfoundland were examined. Based on tagging results and spacing type (spring-spawners and autumn-spawners) composition a fisheries management unit encompassing the area from Cape Anguille to Cape Norman was proposed. Several spawning areas have been identified in this area indicating that there are several herring populations in the area such that the fishery exploits a stock-complex. Several <b>biological</b> characteristics including <b>maturity</b> rate, growth and feeding were examined. A comparison of growth rates from samples taken at two spawning sites and from the fall fishery did not indicate any differences and the populations were, therefore, treated as a unit stock for an analysis of its population dynamics. These analyses indicate that recruitment in recent years has generally been poor particularly among autumn-spawners which have steadily declined in abundance during the period covered by the analysis (1966 - 78). Recruitment to the spring-spawning component has been poor {{with the exception of the}} exceptionally strong 1968 year-class and the moderately strong 1974 year-class., However, no stock and recruit relationship could be established.
