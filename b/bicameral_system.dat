5|$|A further {{distinction}} {{is the number}} of chambers in the national legislature; unicameral systems with one chamber or bicameral ones with a lower house and an upper house. Federations and countries with strong regional differences or regional identities are normally bicameral, to reflect the regions' interests in national bills. The states with the larger populations, from the Netherlands upwards, all have a <b>bicameral</b> <b>system.</b> Although there is a greater mix among the smaller states (some influenced by their federalist structure), the smallest states are on the whole unicameral.|$|E
5|$|The University of Toronto has {{traditionally}} been a decentralized institution, with governing authority shared among its central administration, academic faculties and colleges. The Governing Council is the unicameral legislative organ of the central administration, overseeing general academic, business and institutional affairs. Before 1971, the university was governed under a <b>bicameral</b> <b>system</b> composed {{of the board of}} governors and the university senate. The chancellor, usually a former governor general, lieutenant governor, premier or diplomat, is the ceremonial head of the university. The president is appointed by the council as the chief executive.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bicameral</b> <b>system</b> of the Ottoman parliament—composed of {{an upper}} house, the Senate of viziers, {{assigned}} by the Sultan, and the lower house, the Chamber of Deputies, selected by two-level elections—was dissolved, which had already been defunct since the Allied occupation of Istanbul in 1920 and consequently.|$|E

25|$|The Spanish Cortes Generales were {{regarded}} as an imperfect <b>bicameral</b> <b>system.</b> The Congress of Deputies had greater legislative power than the Senate, having the ability to grant or revoke confidence from a Prime Minister and to override Senate vetoes by an absolute majority of votes. Nonetheless, the Senate possessed a few exclusive, yet limited in number functions—such as its role in constitutional amendment—which were {{not subject to the}} Congress' override. Voting for the Cortes Generales was on the basis of universal suffrage, with all nationals over eighteen and in full enjoyment of all political rights entitled to vote.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{centers on}} the study of {{institutions}} in <b>bicameral</b> legislative <b>systems</b> in Latin America, paying attention to their variations and the potentially different results affecting the decision making system. It aims to identify the impact each institutional arrangement may have on the legislators' strategies and behavior and on various aspects of public policy development. For this purpose, various institutional characteristics are examined, such as: the rules of legislators' selection, the representation basis, chambers' size, election requirements, term duration, partial seat renewal, and the different modalities for treating legislative bills. The sample of countries for systematic comparison is composed of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Paraguay and Uruguay. Secondarily, the following countries that formerly had <b>bicameral</b> <b>systems</b> were included: Ecuador, Nicaragua, Peru and Venezuela. </span...|$|R

25|$|In the {{constitutional}} convention that followed, a unicameral National Assembly was adopted. This {{came after the}} failure of {{the constitutional}} convention delegates to agree on the setup of the <b>bicameral</b> <b>system</b> that was favored by the majority. It also set the ceiling on its membership to a maximum of 120, that were to be elected every three years; similar to what the Jones Law had provided. It entitled every province, regardless of its population to have at least one representative. The convention likewise provided for the direct election of representatives from the non-predominantly Christian areas previously appointed by the U.S. Governor-General.|$|E

50|$|Unicameralists in New Zealand, like former Prime Minister Sir Geoffrey Palmer, {{argued that}} the country is a small and {{relatively}} homogeneous unitary state, and hence does not need the same arrangements as federal countries like Australia or Canada, although many smaller countries have retained <b>bicameral</b> <b>systems.</b> In addition, other political reforms in New Zealand such as the strengthening of the select committee system and the introduction of proportional representation are seen to provide adequate checks and balances.|$|R
40|$|The {{political}} {{weight of}} the Latin-American territories is clear from their electoral processes, administrative organization and party systems with low nationalization (Mainwaring and Jones, 2003). Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Chile and Ecuador, among others, are a proof {{of the role of}} territory in their legislative representation. <b>Bicameral</b> <b>systems</b> {{turn out to be a}} solution to the democratic representation problem when both, territory and citizens are important. In this article, we explore the normative tension between the representation principle of one person, one vote and the principle of territorial equality that exists (not only) in federal systems. We also present an analysis of the <b>bicameral</b> representation <b>systems</b> following the above mentioned criteria. The majority of the literature with some exceptions (e. g. Kymlica, 1996) in one way or another has condemned the existence of territorial criteria. This point is also addressed in this work...|$|R

25|$|The {{university}} operates under a <b>bicameral</b> <b>system</b> {{consisting of}} a board of governors and a senate, as legislated by the University of Waterloo Act, 1972. The Board of Governors has responsibility for the university's properties, affairs, and income. The University of Waterloo Act calls for only 36 members, each of whom must hold Canadian citizenship. However, the number of members in the board for the 2013–2014 academic year is 40. The Board has five ex officio members, including the university's chancellor and president, and the mayors of Kitchener and Waterloo. The other 32 {{members of the board}} are either elected or appointed by the various members of the university community, including alumni, faculty, and student body.|$|E

By 1867, the University of New Brunswick had two faculties: Arts and Applied Science. It awarded the degrees of Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Arts, and Doctor of Science. The latter was awarded only in the fields of civil engineering, electrical engineering, and forestry. At this time, the university had 156 male students, 21 female students, and only eleven academic staff, who were all male.|$|E

On 20 March 1901, he put together a new government led by the Radical Mihailo Vujić. The government consisted of representatives from the People’s Radical Party and the Liberal Party. King Alexander then brought about a new octroyed constitution whose main feature was the introduction of a <b>bicameral</b> <b>system</b> consisting of the Senate (upper house) and the National Assembly (lower house). The new constitution gave the monarch the right to appoint the majority of the Senators, which would defend his interests.|$|E

When distinguishing between institutional veto players (political institutions) and partisan veto players (fractionalization among political parties), we further find that the growth effects of property rights are driven mainly by checks on the chief executive (in <b>bicameral</b> <b>systems)</b> and primarily found in countries with large stocks of democratic capital. ...|$|R

During the fourth state reform, the responsibilities of the Communities and the Regions were expanded again, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of the parliaments of the Communities and the Regions, the splitting up of the Province of Brabant into Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant, and the reformation of the Federal Parliament's <b>bicameral</b> <b>system</b> and the relations between the Federal Parliament and the Federal Government.
