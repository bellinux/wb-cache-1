5|$|What is most {{important}} for us, out of the heathen fancy of a kidnapping man of the moon, which, apart from Scandinavia, was doubtless in vogue all over Teutondom, if not farther, there has evolved itself since a Christian adaptation.

Plainly enough the water-pole of the heathen story has been transformed into the axe's shaft, and the carried pail into the thornbrush; the general idea of theft was retained, but special stress laid on the keeping of the christian holiday; the man suffers punishment not so much for cutting firewood, as because he did it on Sunday.|$|E

40|$|Gagea lutea (L.) Ker-Gawl. is {{a rather}} rare species {{in the eastern part}} of the Netherlands, {{occurring}} chiefly in the so-called Drenthian and Subcentral European districts; besides, it is recorded from some findspots in the province of North-Holland (fig. 1). A number of records of G. lutea in literature in fact refer to other species, especially G. pratensis; a survey is given of false and doubtful records. According to HILLEGERS (1970) and TEN KLOOSTER & LANJOUW (1972), in the Drenthian district G. lutea is chiefly found in gardens and lawns and on treaded places in the shade of trees, nearly always growing within or in the close vicinity of human settlements. Inter alia, it occurs in so-called „stinse milieus” (i. e., woods and parks near old buildings like castles, countryseats, churches and so on, with a herb layer that is partially spontaneous, partially consisting of old medicinal and ornamental plants) in the province of Groningen and on some places outside. In the present paper, three additional types of habitat of the species are described, viz. : 1 °. woods on the banks of brooks and rivers (in the eastern parts of Gelderland and Overijssel); 2 °. woods at the foot of slopes, often on spots with horizontally moving water in the subsoil (this type of habitat is very rare in the south-eastern part of the Netherlands and on the inner side of the dunes; one of the most beautiful localities has been destroyed); 3 °. <b>brushwoods</b> on the outskirt of coppice woods (in a few places in the north of Drenthe and the east of Overijssel). Table 1 comprises a number of „releves” (1 — 23) of these three types of habitat. They show a rather large amount of mutual similarity in vegetation composition. They are obviously richer in woodland species and nitrophilous penumbra herbs than the vegetation in the previously mentioned treaded places, lawns, etc. (24 — 27). Because all localities of G. lutea in the Drenthian district represent anthropogenic habitats (for also the <b>brushwoods</b> mentioned sub 3 ° are heavily influenced by men), probably it must be looked upon as an archaeophytic species in this part of the Netherlands. In the south-eastern part of the country, however, G. lutea is a part of the original woodland vegetation; its localities in this region connect with similar localities in Germany and Belgium. The four Gagea species that occur in the Netherlands constitute an ecological series in the order G. villosa— G. pratensis—G. lutea—G. spathacea. While G. villosa (rare in our country nowadays, showing a stronger decline than the other species) is restricted to habitats strongly influenced by men (treaded places and lawns; previously also in arable land), G. pratensis occurs in the same habitats but is also found sometimes in vegetations that are to a lesser degree anthropogenic. G. lutea is restricted to anthropogenic habitats only in a part of our country, growing in woods with a spontaneous herb layer elsewhere, while G. spathacea is nearly always found in semi-natural woods...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine sheep production practices, constraints, flock dynamics, body condition and weight variation in two ecologically different resource-poor communal farming systems of the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Mean sheep flock sizes per household were not significantly different between the two ecologically different areas (villages); Gaga (19. 0 ± 3. 10) and Sompondo (18. 3 ± 3. 10). Shortage of feed, disease and parasite were reported the most important constraints across the two villages. In both villages, sheep housing was poorly constructed using acacia <b>brushwoods.</b> Fewer farmers owned rams: the rams to ewes ratio for the two villages were 1 : 20, 1 : 19 for Gaga and Sompondo, respectively. The low ram: ewe ratios reported suggest that inbreeding might have been reducing productivity of their flocks. There was also uncontrolled breeding due to undefined and mating seasons. Gall sickness, heart water and footrot caused most of the sheep mortalities. Dohne Merinos were the common genotypes in the two villages. Total entrances for each flock were higher (p < 0. 05) in hot-dry season and hot-wet season than in other seasons. Most of the entrances were lambs and were born in hot-dry season (September) and cool-dry season (June) for larger flocks (10. 90 ± 3. 02) and for small flocks (3. 65 ± 3. 02). High lamb mortalities were experienced in the post-rainy (April) and hot-wet (December) season. There was a significant interaction between season and flock size. Most of the sales occurred in the hot-wet season. Ecological area had significant effect on sheep production potential (p < 0. 05) in both flock classes. The average sheep production efficiency (SPE) value for Gaga and Sompondo were 0. 50 ± 0. 116 and 0. 50 ± 0. 096 respectively. The SPE for large flock was higher (p < 0. 05) by season and flock size. Large flocks had a higher (p < 0. 05) SPE values and the SPE ranged from 1. 11 ± 0. 193 in April, a post-rainy season month to 1. 55 ± 0. 193 in December, a hot-wet season month. Lamb mortalities constituted the greater part of outflows. High lamb mortalities occurred in hot-wet (December), hot-dry (September) and post-rainy (April) seasons. There was a significant interaction between season and age of sheep on body weight of sheep. Highest (p < 0. 05) body weights were recorded in the post-rainy and autumn season in both lambs and ewes. It is therefore very important to come up with affordable interventions which take into play ecological differences of the areas for improved nutritional status of sheep in communal areas which will lead to improved sheep productivity and the poor-resourced farmer human nutritional and livelihood...|$|R

25|$|Columbanus and {{his companions}} were {{received}} with favour by King Gontram of Burgundy, and soon {{they made their way}} to Annegray, where they founded a monastery in an abandoned Roman fortress. Despite its remote location in the Vosges Mountains, the community became a popular pilgrimage site that attracted so many monastic vocations that two new monasteries had to be formed to accommodate them.

The castle, soon transformed into a monastery, was located in a wild region, thickly covered with pine forests and <b>brushwood.</b> Columbanus erected a third monastery called Ad-fontanas at present-day Fontaine-lès-Luxeuil, named for its numerous springs. These monastic communities remained under Columbanus' authority, and their rules of life reflected the Irish tradition in which he had been formed.

25|$|Some writers {{hold that}} Dumfries flourished {{as a place}} of {{distinction}} during the Roman occupation of North Great Britain. The Selgovae inhabited Nithsdale at the time and may have raised some military works of a defensive nature on or near the site of Dumfries; and it is more than probable that a castle of some kind formed the nucleus of the town. This is inferred from the etymology of the name, which, according to one theory, is resolvable into two Gaelic terms signifying a castle or fort in the copse or <b>brushwood.</b> Dumfries was once within the borders of the Kingdom of Northumbria. The district around Dumfries was for several centuries ruled over and deemed of much importance by the invading Romans. Many traces of Roman presence in Dumfriesshire are still to be found; coins, weapons, sepulchral remains, military earthworks, and roads being among the relics left by their lengthened sojourn in this part of Scotland. The apostle Paul claimed rank and privilege as a Roman citizen on account of his birth at Tarsus; the Caledonian tribes in the south of Scotland were invested with the same rights by an edict of Antoninus Pius. The Romanized natives received freedom (the burrows, cairns, and remains of stone temples still to be seen in the district tell of a time when Druidism was the prevailing religion) as well as civilisation from their conquerors.
