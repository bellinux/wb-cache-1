25|$|The {{amplitude}} of the BOLD signal {{does not necessarily}} affect its shape. A higher-amplitude signal may be seen for stronger neural activity, but peaking {{at the same place}} as a weaker signal. Also, the amplitude does not necessarily reflect behavioral performance. A complex cognitive task may initially trigger high-amplitude signals associated with good performance, but as the subject gets <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>it,</b> the amplitude may decrease with performance staying the same. This is expected to be due to increased efficiency in performing the task. The BOLD response across brain regions cannot be compared directly even for the same task, since the density of neurons and the blood-supply characteristics are not constant across the brain. However, the BOLD response can often be compared across subjects for the same brain region and the same task.|$|E
500|$|Guitar Hero {{games have}} been used {{alongside}} physical therapy to help recovering stroke patients, because of the multiple limb coordination that the titles require. Blondie drummer Clem Burke has worked with researchers at the University of Chichester and the University of Gloucestershire to determine how games like Guitar Hero can address issues of [...] "child and adult obesity, autism, stroke patients and health and mental well-being in the workplace". Researchers at Johns Hopkins University have used Guitar Hero III and its controller to help amputee patients, and to develop new prosthetic limbs for these patients. Researchers at University of Nevada, Reno modified a haptic feedback glove {{to work with the}} Guitar Hero freeware clone Frets on Fire, resulting in , a music game for visually impaired players that is played with only touch and audio. MIT students collaborated with the government of Singapore and a professor at the National University of Singapore to create AudiOdyssey, a game which allows both blind and sighted gamers to play together. Guitar Hero was used as part of a Trent University youth sleep study, which showed that, in general, players who played a song were <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> twelve hours later if that period included normal sleep.|$|E
500|$|... "One Wonderful Day" [...] also {{introduced}} the second-season mystery surrounding Betty Applewhite (Alfre Woodard) and Matthew Applewhite (Mehcad Brooks). Cherry revealed, [...] "they {{come on the}} street; they seem like nice people — but they've got a secret. And it's pretty gothic. It's real and human and awful {{all at the same}} time." [...] Another scene featuring the Applewhite family, in which Betty brings food to a prisoner in their basement, was cut from this episode but was used in the second season premiere, [...] "Next". Cherry's inspiration for the Lynette storyline came from his own childhood experience when his mother returned to work. He commented: [...] "The predicament of any working woman is that you can love your career, but there is something... to be said for getting to stay home every day with your kids, and you don't want anyone else to be <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> than you are. Felicity Huffman expressed satisfaction with how her storyline was handled, explaining that Lynette [...] "didn't deal with [...] in the most straightforward way, but she was fighting for her family. They were noble motives." [...] While discussing the courtroom scene in which Carlos attacks John, Ricardo Antonio Chavira commented: [...] "People can see the full rage that is in my character. I'm yelling at him, 'I'm gonna kill you'... Then I broke into Spanish: [...] "Yo voy a matar!"... I just went for it... Then I looked, and Jesse [...] had the most honest look of sheer terror. I think I scared the living shit out of him." ...|$|E

He said the love songs he had were optimistic. The interview gives a good idea as to how Wright worked in the studio with Vanda and Young:;"Well, it's a three way thing. [...] They'll sit down and say 'we've got this sort of song' and we'll discuss how we'll approach it. Obviously after this long we do have a very strong bond. I've written a couple of songs but since they're far <b>better</b> <b>at</b> <b>it</b> than I am, I'll let them handle that."
