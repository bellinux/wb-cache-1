The approach suggested here, in order to estimate the fatigue crack initiation life, can be split into two stages. First, stabilized stress-strain cycles are obtained in all points of the welded joint by a finite element analysis, taking constant or variable amplitude loadings into account. This calculation takes account of: base metal elastic-plastic <b>behaviour,</b> <b>variable</b> yield stress based on hardness measurements in various zones of the weld, local geometry at the weld toe and residual stresses if any. Second, if a fast elastic shakedown occurs, a two-scale damage model based on Lemaitre et al. 's work {{is used as a}} post-processor in order to estimate the fatigue crack initiation life. Material parameters for this model were identified from two Wöhler curves established for base metal. As a validation, four-point bending fatigue tests were carried out on welded specimens supplied by `DCNS company'. Two load ratios were considered: 0. 1 and 0. 3. Residual stress measurements by X-ray diffraction completed this analysis. Comparisons between experimental and calculated fatigue lives are promising for the considered loadings.

Bottom-up statistical models have been identified as one major modelling technique, particularly accounting for the diversity of inhabitants behaviours. In the various statistical models of the literature, behaviour characteristics are seldom incorporated in the data set but socioeconomic data are most often used as " proxy " of occupant behaviour. The present study is based on a detailed survey, combining energy billing data with technical, geographical, socioeconomic and behavioural variables. The corresponding sample, despite of its limited size (420 individuals), is representative of French households. A statistical model relating energy consumption to the other variables has been applied, enabling simultaneous use of quantitative and qualitative explanatory factors (ANCOVA, analysis of covariance).

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The Pebble Bed Modular Reactor (PBMR) is a {{power plant}} that {{utilizes}} a High Temperature Reactor (HTR) and a closed-cycle gas turbine power conversion system. Many man-years of compiling a safety analysis report are involved in obtaining a licence from a national nuclear regulatory authority. Multiple computer code systems must be integrated to perform the required calculations. In PBMR (Pty) Ltd, this integration is currently performed offline, without the ability to capture time-dependent circular feedback effects. The main codes used for transient calculations involving the reactor are the 2 D neutronics code TINTE and the thermal-fluids systems code Flownex Nuclear. A time history trace of thermal-fluid boundary conditions is first calculated by Flownex Nuclear and then used by TINTE. The purpose {{of this research was}} to establish an integrated time-dependent design and safety analysis capability, with the ability to perform detailed simulation and control of all reactor plant modes and transitions. The Nuclear Engineering Analysis (NEA) Simulator, which is based on existing simulator architecture, was established to integrate and coordinate these types of analyses. The NEA Simulator enabled progressive development of the integrated simulation, with a fundamental understanding of external coupling of these codes. TINTE-calculated reactor outlet temperature and total power are used to influence time-dependent system flow <b>behaviour.</b> <b>Variable</b> simulation time steps are introduced to accelerate integrated simulations. Continuous local time-step management for the TINTE temperature solver is implemented in the TINTE-NEA Simulator interface to make it resilient. Explicit external coupling of two open-loop thermal-fluid models with circular dependencies produced acceptable results for fixed pressure transients, but not when pressure was solved. The parallel coupling was the most stable and versatile coupling analysed in this research; it also works for transients where pressure is solved. Important building blocks were established to simulate plant modes and transitions continuously. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{international}} {{pet food}} industry is robust. The pet food industry in South Africa is structured similarly {{to those in}} developed markets, yet there exists a chasm of independent and commercial research within the South African context. Emerging in international markets are alternative and commercial pet food consumers. While studies do explore these two categories of consumer separately, there is a noticeable absence of comparative studies into the purchase decisions of these consumers. This study addresses that by using the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and its constructs to facilitate {{an investigation into the}} purchase decision of both consumer groups. A survey was conveniently distributed through social media channels, such as South African pet owner group pages on Facebook. The result was that pet owners with an interest in some aspect of their pet's being were selected for the study. Since this sampling procedure was not without bias, the scope of the study covers South African pet owners at large, but should be treated as a precursory study. The study attempted to investigate any differences in the TPB variables between the two consumer groups as well as the correlations between the variables and whether purchase points and information sources could be used to better target these broad consumer segments. The theory allowed for consistent measurement of the TPB variables between both consumer groups. The findings were that there were no statistically significant differences in the measurements gleaned on each of the theory of planned behaviour constructs. However, when coupled with another consumer <b>behaviour</b> <b>variable,</b> pet food information source, some new useable data emerged. Salespeople and pet preference were found to be unique to commercial pet food consumers. Specialty pet stores and pet trainers were found to be unique o alternative pet food consumers. Greater proportions of commercial pet food consumers used package print and vets as information sources, while more alternative pet food consumers used online sources. Both consumer categories were equally proportionate in accepting recommendations from friends. This information along with findings of a moderate correlation between perceived behavioural control and behavioural intention, could lead to better consumer engagement or targeting for enterprises...|$|E

40|$|Comprehensive {{research}} has been done on organisational behaviour, entrepreneurial spirit, entrepreneur, entrepreneurship and corporate entrepreneurship. Literature is however less clear on which organisational behaviour components influence corporate entrepreneurship. This creates a problem for managers and business leaders when they want to influence the entrepreneurial spirit within an organisation. This study summaries the literature on organisational <b>behaviour</b> <b>variables</b> and corporate entrepreneurship, as well as the limited findings linking the two concepts. The empirical study focuses four areas: testing validity and reliability of the measurements used in the study; the correlation between organisational behaviour components and corporate entrepreneurship; the ability of organisational behaviour components to predict corporate entrepreneurship; and finally testing if the grouping of organisational <b>behaviour</b> <b>variables</b> is justified. This cross sectional study was done in 12 non-listed and 5 listed companies in South Africa. Randomly selected employees completed 862 questionnaires. They represented all the local ethnic groups, both genders, and were from all organisational levels. The results of the empirical study indicated that the measurements used in the study were all acceptable being reliable and valid. The correlation between the selected organisational behaviour components and corporate entrepreneurship were all strong and significant, with goal setting the strongest, followed by performance management, then transformational leadership, and communication. The correlation with shared decision making, organisational culture, and power were less strong but still significant. The organisational behaviour components together declare a 46. 5 % variance in corporate entrepreneurship with organisational culture and goal setting contributing significantly and uniquely.

Lameness in dairy cows is highly prevalent and painful. These impacts potentially affect not only animal welfare, but also farm economies. Three independent observational {{studies were carried out}} {{to assess the impact of}} lameness on the behaviour of zero grazed high yielding Holstein cows managed in an AMS. The aim of the first study was to examine the impact of lameness on rumination time, the second study investigated differences between lame and sound dairy cows in total eating time and the third study assessed the impact of lameness on milking behaviour (frequency and time of visits to the AMS). In the first study data from 150 cows were used to analyse rumination (collected using rumination collars) for the 48 hr following locomotion scoring. A multilevel linear regression demonstrated that lameness had a small but significant negative association (coefficient: - 7. 88 (SE: 3. 93)) with rumination. In the second study the behaviour of eleven matched lame and sound pairs of cows at the feed face was analysed for 24 hours after locomotion scoring. Each feeding <b>behaviour</b> <b>variable</b> (total duration time, frequency of feeding bouts and length of bouts) was analysed using individual single level regression models. There was a significant negative association between total feeding time and lameness (coefficient: - 73. 65 (SE: 25. 47)) and the frequency of feeding bouts and lameness (- 9. 93 (2. 49)). Finally, the third observational study used 38 matched pairs of lame and sound cows. Data on the number and timings of visits to the AMS were collected for 24 hours after each locomotion score and analysed using a binomial logistic regression model. There was a significant difference in AMS visits between groups; lame animals visiting the robot less frequently than sound cows (median difference 0. 50 milking visits; T = 256. 0; N = 25; p = 0. 01) and lame cows were 0. 33 times less likely to visit the AMS between 24 : 01 and 06 : 00. Results from these studies reveal that lameness in an AMS affected feeding behaviour, rumination and AMS visits. All of these impacts are likely to have negative consequences for farm profitability, but also implications for the health and welfare of the animals...|$|E

Following an inspection of research findings pertinent to undergraduate academic achievement, Anxiety-Stability, Introversion-Extraversion, and an Organizational Study Behaviour scale were entered as aptitudes, and the prescribed assessment tasks in a course of study in Education at the James Cook University of North Queensland were entered as treatments The personality domain was structured via factor analyses of items drawn from relevant aspects of research into student achievement, and the Study Behaviour scale was taken directly from the work of Biggs (1973). Performance domain variables were subjected to task analysis in order to devise appropriate predictions relating each performance task to the system of reference variables. The Aptitude-Treatment-Interaction model was applied using well established procedures, except for a systematic confounding of the dependent variable set with the treatments used. Differentiations of performance were studied both within tasks and in contrasts involving two levels of inter-task analysis; at the first level each task was compared with all other tasks taken together, and at the second level comparisons were made task by task. Throughout these analyses the specific role of a three-way compound involving the Anxiety-Stability/Introversion-Extraversion/Study <b>Behaviour</b> <b>variable</b> set was under close scrutiny as a particular reflection of the essential characteristics of an Aptitude-Treatment-Interaction research model. The results of the study provided clear, though somewhat uneven, support for the interactive system that had been formulated; however this support was only evident in those cases where inter-task comparisons were made. There was no indication that the three-way compound of specific interest in the analyses was relevant across subjects within tasks. Where detailed analytic competencies were identified as task infraskills, {{and in the case of}} performance in small group tutorial settings, relative success was characterized by low Anxiety, moderate levels of Extraversion, and well organized Study Behaviour. By contrast, relative success on more conventionally defined Essay tasks was characterized by higher levels of Anxiety and Introversion, with Study Behaviour evidently having little impact. The results consistently pointed up the importance of Anxiety-Stability in the differentiations studied. These findings were interpreted with special reference to the need for a content-based articulation of undergraduate assessment programmes and the significance of a non-unitary concept of academic achievement. Within the broader philosophical arena, the results were considered to offer support for the substantial dominance of subject matter over more radically individualistic orientations in the acquisition of knowledge...|$|E
40|$|New Zealand {{farmers are}} facing {{pressure}} to reduce nutrient losses from their farming enterprises to the environment. Research suggests that on farms {{the major source}} of nutrient loss is animal excreta, which for nitrogen (N) relates to cattle urine in particular. Most models used to predict N cycling and loss assume homogeneous distribution of bovine urine patches across paddocks. This study aims to provide baseline understanding of how dairy cows distribute urine, in regard to activity patterns and several environmental factors, by using sensor technologies to investigate the patterns of excreta distribution from dairy cows under commercial conditions. The study took place on a commercial dairy farm, No. 4 Dairy Farm, Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand during early autumn (March) 2009. Thirty cows in late lactation, balanced for milking order and age, in a herd of 180, were fitted with global positioning system (GPS) collars, IceTag 3 D® activity sensors and urine sensors for seven consecutive days. The herd was milked twice a day and rotationally grazed, without supplements. Animals were at pasture from 06 : 00 h to 14 : 00 h (AM grazing) and from 15 : 00 h to 05 : 00 h (PM grazing). Cows were rotated through 12 paddocks each of about ~ 1. 1 ha. The use of urine sensors, GPS units and IceTag 3 D®s was an effective method for capturing data on the temporal and spatial behaviour of dairy cows in a commercial herd. The majority of urine (85 % of total) was deposited on pasture. Urine deposits, together with grazing, lying, standing and walking behaviour, showed non-homogenous density patterns not conforming to a uniform Poisson distribution, indicating a non-random distribution, implying that there was an aggregation of urine patches and particular behaviours within grazed paddocks. The dairy cows were observed to have distinctive time budgets where the times of sunset and sunrise, together with the removal of cows for milking, were the main factors influencing activity patterns of animals in this study. There were associations between the spatial density patterns of behaviour and urine patches, with time of day influencing the levels of association. Fitting urine patch data with a distribution that {{is a function of the}} density of a particular <b>behaviour</b> <b>variable</b> was possible, although patterns were inconsistent. Time of day had a significant effect on the fit of an inhomogeneous Poisson process model with behaviour variables being better predictors of urine patch distribution during night hours than during day-light hours. In conclusion a suitable methodology was developed to observe, track and analyse the behaviour of dairy cows managed on pasture under commercial conditions using GPS and sensor technologies. Dairy cows were found to deposit the majority of their urine on pasture, where urine patches were found to have a non-random distribution. Understanding of the spatial location and distribution of urine can allow for the development of management practices that target critical source areas of N leaching...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate if accelerometer-based measures of physical behaviour can be used to determine if people undertake outdoor walking and to provide reference values for physical behaviour outcomes related to outdoor mobility in this population. Older persons (n= 245) aged ≥ 70 years one year after hip fracture participated. Six objective outcome measures of physical behaviour collected by a thigh-mounted activity monitor were compared with self-reported outdoor mobility assessed with the Nottingham Extended ADL scale.

40|$|Orientation: The {{relationship}} between authentic leadership, psychological capital, psychological climate and team commitment in a manufacturing organisation {{could have a}} significant impact on employee intention to quit. Research purpose: To determine the {{relationship between}} five positive organisational <b>behaviour</b> <b>variables</b> (authentic leadership, psychological capital, psychological climate and team commitment) and their ultimate influence on an individual’s intention to quit. Thus, it is preceded by the determination of the structural invariance of the measurement instruments when applied to a South African sample. Justification for the study: The study sought to fill the gap in the literature in relation to understanding the effect of the relationship between psychological capital, authentic leadership, psychological climate and team commitment on the behaviour of employees in a manufacturing organisation and how this influences their decision to quit. Such a study has not previously been conducted in the South African manufacturing sector. Research design, approach and method: Utilising a non-experimental correlational approach, a self-administered composite questionnaire consisting of five psychological scales was distributed to 204 employees in the junior to senior management level at a global tyre manufacturing organisation in South Africa. Multivariate data analysis included the structural equation modelling. Main findings: There is a significantly strong positive relationship between authentic leadership, psychological capital, psychological climate and team commitment. Authentic leadership has a significant influence on psychological capital and psychological climate. This results in a positive impact on organisational commitment, leading to employees’ intention to quit. Practical/managerial implications: Manufacturing organisations need to develop and implement collaborative leadership intervention strategies aimed at improving psychological capital and psychological climate. Contribution/value-add: The findings inform researchers and management from manufacturing organisations to understand the correlation between organisational <b>behaviour</b> <b>variables.</b> This relationship informs the development and implementation of strategies aimed at furnishing psychological capital and psychological climate. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine {{relationships}} between personality factors and consumer <b>behaviour</b> <b>variables</b> for services.. The study has various distinctive features. Previously there has been no meaningful research on the relationship between personality traits and consumer <b>behaviour</b> <b>variables.</b> Most previous studies were directed towards establishing a relationship between individual personality traits and buying behaviour or to predict sales of expensive items such as automobiles, in which personality was not the only influencing factor. Moreover, almost all of the earlier work on personality traits and consumer decisionmaking, was targeted at the study of products not services. In contrast, the current study was aimed at 'usage' behaviour rather than 'buying' behaviour; and building the conceptual framework on services rather than products. Using two studies (N= 120 and N = 987), consistent support was found for the effects of personality traits on customer loyalty, satisfaction and switching patterns among mobile phone and credit card users. The personality factor Agreeableness emerged as a single predictor for Customer Loyalty and Customer Satisfaction for both senrices. Openness to Experience was observed as a single predictor of customer switching. Personality facets Modesty, Altruism, and Trust were consistent in providing major predictive power predicting customer satisfaction for different services and in different studies. Similarly the personality facets Altruism, and Trust were consistent in predicting customer Loyalty for two different services and in two different studies. Customer switching was well predicted by the personality facet Values in addition to other facets. It was also understood that under different market conditions different consumer behavior variables might be predicted by different personality facets but major predictive power was found among the facets mentioned above. A number of factors suggest that these results generalizable globally but they were subject to a number of limitations, and hence further research is warranted.

The study aimed to determine Middle Years teachers&# 039; perceptions and management of disruptive classroom <b>behaviour.</b> <b>Variables</b> such as gender, teacher confidence and experience, supports, specific disruptive student behaviours, and behaviour management strategies were examined. The results showed that teachers&# 039; main concerns were related to distractibility, student on-task behaviour, and adherence to classroom rules. In relation to classroom management, {{no significant differences were}} identified between the management strategies employed by {{primary and secondary}} school teachers. However, differences were identified in the management strategies teachers used to manage the behaviour of male and female students. In relation to disruptive student behaviour, an increase in reports of aggressive male behaviour was observed from primary to secondary school...|$|R

40|$|Event-B [6] is a {{formalism}} for discrete system modelling. Key {{features of}} Event-B {{include the use}} of set theory as a modelling notation, the use of refinement to model systems at different levels of abstraction, and the use of mathematical proof to verify consistency between refinement levels. Event-B provides two constructs to model systems; contexts describe static properties (constants and carrier sets) whereas machines model dynamic <b>behaviour</b> (<b>variables</b> and events). In this document we propose a mechanism by which the mathematical language of Event-B as well as the proof capabilities of its tool [7] can be extended by users whilst maintaining the soundness of the prover. Initially, we focus on extending the prover with a subset of proof rules: the rewrite rules. We envisage the new mechanism to evolve to cater for the different mathematical extensions proposed in [4]...|$|R

The proposed solution is a history-based model that predicts whether a user will vote a given movie. Key points to our approach are (1) the estimation of the model baseline, (2) {{the definition of the}} explanatory variables and (3) the mathematical model form. Given the binary outcome of the problem, the estimation of the true baseline (ratio of 1 ’s in the test data) is critical in order to correctly make predictions. In parallel, to improve the model predictive power, we have developed a careful construction of the input variables. These explanatory variables can be grouped as: user voting <b>behaviour</b> <b>variables,</b> the movie characteristics and user-movie interactions. Finally, the mathematical model form (linear logistic regression) has been chosen among various model form competitors...|$|R
