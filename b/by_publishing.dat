5|$|As the {{libel suit}} against Marshall dragged on in Mercer County Circuit Court, Innes {{and his allies}} hired author William Littell to publish Innes' version of his {{interactions}} with Spain. Marshall countered <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> his History of Kentucky in 1812. Although blatantly partisan, it became the most popular history of Kentucky at the time. When Street returned to Kentucky to give a deposition in the case in 1814, Innes swore out a writ against him to collect the damages awarded in his case against Street. Unable to pay, Street was imprisoned.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that the first issue of New Worlds appeared, a {{separate}} British magazine called Fantasy was launched by Walter Gillings, a science fiction fan and a reporter by profession. Fantasy lasted for only three issues before dying in 1947, but Gillings had accumulated a substantial inventory of stories—enough to fill nine issues. Gillings followed the demise of Fantasy <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> a fanzine, titled Fantasy Review, beginning in March 1947.|$|E
5|$|Charles Cardell (1892–1977) was {{the founder}} of a Pagan Witchcraft {{tradition}} that rivalled that of Gerald Gardner's in southern England during the 1950s. A psychologist and stage conjurer, Cardell ran a company named Dumblecott Magick Productions {{from his home in}} Charlwood, Surrey, from where he also controlled a local coven that was spied on by the press, leading to a well-publicised court case. Having been involved with Spiritualism as well as Pagan Witchcraft, Cardell initially befriended Gardner, but in 1958 they had an argument, and in 1964 Cardell tried to discredit him <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> much of the then-secret Gardnerian Book of Shadows.|$|E

5|$|Dickens {{returned}} to the tale several times during his life to amend the phrasing and punctuation. He capitalised {{on the success of}} the book <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> other Christmas stories The Chimes (1844), The Cricket on the Hearth (1845), The Battle of Life (1846) and The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain (1848); these were secular conversion tales which reflected the societal changes of the previous year, and which social problems still needed to be dealt with. While the public eagerly bought the later books, the reviewers were highly critical of the stories.|$|E
5|$|Godwin, {{the son of}} Thomas Godwin, Bishop of Bath and Wells, {{was elected}} a student of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1578, from where he {{received}} his Bachelor of Arts (1581) and Master of Arts degrees (1584); after entering the church he gained his Bachelor (1594) and Doctor of Divinity (1596) degrees. He gained prominence (even internationally) in 1601 <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> his Catalogue of the Bishops of England since the first planting of the Christian Religion in this Island, which enabled his rapid rise in the church hierarchy. During his life, {{he was known as}} a historian.|$|E
5|$|He {{published}} for {{the first}} time under his own name in 1829. Les Chouans, a novel about royalist forces in Brittany, did not succeed commercially, but it made Balzac known in literary circles. He achieved a major success later the same year when he published La Physiologie du mariage, a treatise on the institution of marriage. Bolstered by its popularity, he added to his fame <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> a variety of short stories and essays in the magazines Revue de Paris, La Caricature, and La Mode. He thus made connections in the publishing industry that later helped him to obtain reviews of his novels.|$|E

5|$|In the 1790s, Johnson aligned {{himself with}} the {{supporters}} of the French Revolution, and published {{an increasing number of}} political pamphlets in addition to a prominent journal, the Analytical Review, which offered British reformers a voice in the public sphere. In 1799, he was indicted on charges of seditious libel for publishing a pamphlet by the Unitarian minister Gilbert Wakefield. After spending six months in prison, albeit under relatively comfortable conditions, Johnson published fewer political works. In the last decade of his career, Johnson did not seek out many new writers; however, he remained successful <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> the collected works of authors such as William Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|Some {{accounts}} of Nostradamus's life state {{that he was}} afraid of being persecuted for heresy by the Inquisition, but neither prophecy nor astrology fell in this bracket, and he would have been in danger only if he had practised magic to support them. In 1538 he came into conflict with the Church in Agen after an Inquisitor visited the area looking for Anti-Catholic views. His brief imprisonment at Marignane in late 1561 was solely because he had violated a recent royal decree <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> his 1562 almanac without the prior permission of a bishop.|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} that the general strike could be used, but {{only as a last}} resort, became dominant in the party during the mass strike debate. This caused much concern among the conservatives in the party, especially among many trade unionists. At a meeting in February 1906, the trade unionists were placated by party leaders, who said they would attempt to prevent a general strike at all costs. The FVdG reacted <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> the secret protocols from the meeting in Die Einigkeit, greatly angering the party leadership.|$|E

5|$|During his NBA career, Bradley {{used his}} fame {{on the court}} to explore social as well as {{political}} issues, meeting with journalists, government officials, academics, businesspeople, and social activists. He also worked as an assistant to the director of the Office of Economic Opportunity in Washington, D.C., and as a teacher in the street academies of Harlem. In 1976, he also became an author <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> Life on the Run. Using a 20-day stretch of time during one season as the main focus of the book, he chronicled his experiences in the NBA and the people he met along the way. He noted in the book that he had initially signed only a four-year contract, and that he was uncomfortable using his celebrity status to earn extra money endorsing products as other players did.|$|E
5|$|Having {{performed}} in parlor theatricals as a child, from 1916 Simonovich-Efimova began staging puppet shows for fellow artists. The plays were so well received {{that she and}} her husband were invited to create a children's puppet theater by the Russian authorities in 1918, becoming two of the first professional puppeteers in Russia. She created innovative designs to make her manikins lifelike, promoting her work <b>by</b> <b>publishing</b> books and teaching puppetry theory and design. She and her husband are known as the first couple of Russian puppetry, though she was the one determined to elevate the craft. They performed over 1,500 shows throughout Russia between 1920 and 1940, moving from place to place with their traveling puppet theater.|$|E
