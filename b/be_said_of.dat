5|$|Little can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} genus, mainly because remains of other Neogene New World vultures are usually younger or even more fragmentary. The teratorns held sway over the ecological niche of the extant group especially in North America. The Kern vulture seems to slightly precede the main bout of the Great American Interchange, and it is notable that the living diversity of New World vultures seems to have originated in Central America. The Kern vulture would therefore represent a northwards divergence possibly sister to the S. fisheri – S. papa lineage. The fossil record, though scant, supports {{the theory that the}} ancestral king vultures and South American condors separated at least some 5 mya.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more can}} <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> Padarn, though he later {{attracted}} the usual hagiography, the Vita Sancti Paternus, which recounts many supposed {{details of his}} life. He {{may have been more}} closely associated with late Romano-British civilization than some other early British saints, as his dedications are apparently connected by Roman roads. Llanbadarn Fawr is reputed to be close to where the Roman road from North to South Wales (called Sarn Helen) crosses the river Rheidol. Sarn Helen passes close to Strata Florida and Llanddewi Brefi which, along with Llanbadarn Fawr, were the three most important ecclesiastic places in mediaeval Ceredigion.|$|E

25|$|This {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> {{treatments}} of controversial literature and painful 19th century history like Maria Luisa Bemberg's Camila (1984), Carlos Sorin's A King and His Movie (1985) and Eliseo Subiela's Man Facing Southeast (1986).|$|E
25|$|The Celestial Masters' {{activities}} did {{hasten the}} downfall of the Han Dynasty, largely because Zhang's grandson set up a theocratic state into what is now Sichuan province. The same could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> their contemporaries, the Taoist-leaning Yellow Turban sect.|$|E
25|$|Whatever else may <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the {{intricate}} alliance system evolved by the German Chancellor, {{it must be}} admitted that it worked and that it tided Europe {{over a period of}} several critical years without a rupture.... there was, as Bismarck himself said, a premium upon the maintenance of peace.|$|E

25|$|The {{economic}} viability of space {{solar power systems}} depends on many factors and the successful development of various new technologies (not {{least of which is}} the availability of much lower cost access to space than has been available), however, the same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> many other advanced power technologies options.|$|E
25|$|The {{best that}} may <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> Hywel’s {{association}} with the law is that a folk memory recalled a revision and rejuvenation of the law during his reign. Other kings {{are said to have}} introduced later modifications to the laws, for example Bleddyn ap Cynfyn, king of Gwynedd and Powys in the mid 11th century.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{for infants}} or adults, all rites omitted at baptism must be {{afterwards}} supplied. As a rule converts {{are to be}} baptized; but {{care must be taken}} to inquire if they had been previously validly baptized, lest the sacrament be repeated. The same is to <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> those baptized in danger of death by laymen.|$|E
60|$|Miriam looked frightened but {{nodded her}} head, {{and no more}} <b>was</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the matter.|$|R
60|$|Then Sir Eustace, being, as has <b>been</b> <b>said,</b> <b>of</b> early habits, {{made his}} way home.|$|R

25|$|With Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, Raphael's name {{is synonymous}} with the High Renaissance, {{although}} he was younger than Michelangelo by 18 years and Leonardo by almost 30. It cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> him that he greatly advanced the state of painting as his two famous contemporaries did. Rather, his work {{was the culmination of}} all the developments of the High Renaissance.|$|E
25|$|Somerset County Cricket Club {{played in}} Division Two {{of both the}} County Championship and the Sunday League in 2005. Somerset started at 10-1 to finish Division Two County Champions. Batting seems strong with Smith, Jayasuriya, Blackwell and Trescothick. But the same cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the bowling, which will find it {{difficult}} to dismiss teams twice on the flat Taunton pitch.|$|E
25|$|Some have {{questioned}} {{the ability of the}} federal government to achieve greater savings than the largest PDPs, since some of the larger plans have coverage pools comparable to Medicare’s, though the evidence from the VHA is promising. Some also worry that controlling the prices of prescription drugs would reduce incentives for manufacturers to invest in R, though the same could <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> anything that would reduce costs.|$|E
5000|$|He {{is known}} for his {{positive}} rabbinical opinion on [...] "You shall rise {{in the presence of the}} aged" [...] (Leviticus 19:32), which in other rabbinical sages' opinions <b>is</b> <b>said</b> only <b>of</b> an elderly Talmid Chacham, and in his opinion <b>is</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> any aged person.|$|R

25|$|The Marine Corps’ {{military}} operations in urban terrain doctrine recognizes that tactical success does not necessarily translate to strategic victory. It notes the Israeli’s tactical victory in Beirut was a strategic defeat—and observes the same about the Battle of Hue in the Vietnam War, when Marines defeated an enemy that sought {{to put up a}} good fight but never expected to win. Much the same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> Fallujah’s defenders. In spite of the beating they took in November, they will continue to assert they repelled the initial attack and fought well thereafter.|$|E
25|$|Although Sweden {{kept the}} Poles and the Danes at a distance, {{this could not}} <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the Russians. In the Great Northern War (1700–1721), Czar Peter the Great utterly {{destroyed}} Sweden's pretensions to being a regional superpower. In the 1721 Treaty of Nystad, Estonia and Livonia, which had again been completely devastated after {{more than twenty years}} of war, were claimed by Russia. Curonia continued to be ruled by its dukes for another three-quarters of a century, but in 1795, that region also became a Russian possession as part of the Third Partition of Poland.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} civil rights infringement, the Charter has faced legal {{challenges}} because the restricted education opportunities have hindered not only unilingual but bilingual anglophones' employment. Although the Charter made French the official language of government and civil administration, the same cannot <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> the private sector. Despite nearly 30 years of the Charter, {{it has never been}} applied as rigorously as intended because to do so would violate civil liberties. English is still often made a requirement by employers in Montreal, including many French-Canadian owned ones, and, to a lesser extent, in Gatineau and Quebec City, with the workforce in Montreal remaining largely bilingual despite the Charter.|$|E

25|$|To refute Hegel's {{claim that}} Christianity should be {{understood}} {{as a part of the}} necessary evolution of thought, or in Hegelians terms, Spirit, in Fear and Trembling, Kierkegaard attempts to use the story of Abraham to show that there is a goal higher than that of ethics (questioning the Hegelian claim that doing one's ethical duty is the highest that can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> a human being) and that faith cannot be explained by Hegelian ethics, (disproving Hegel's claim that Christianity can be rationally explained by philosophy). Either way, this work can be read as a challenge to the Hegelian notion that a human being's ultimate purpose is to fulfill ethical demands.|$|E
25|$|Cast threads {{in metal}} parts may be {{finished}} by machining, {{or may be}} left in the as-cast state. (The same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> cast gear teeth.) Whether or not to bother with the additional expense of a machining operation depends on the application. For parts where the extra precision and surface finish is not strictly necessary, the machining is forgone in order to achieve a lower cost. With sand casting parts this means a rather rough finish; but with molded plastic or die-cast metal, the threads can be very nice indeed straight from the mold or die. A common example of molded plastic threads is on soda (pop) bottles. A common example of die-cast threads is on cable glands (connectors/fittings).|$|E
25|$|The {{role and}} nature of Sanskrit {{must be taken into}} {{consideration}} to understand the occurrence of consonant clusters. The orthography of written Sanskrit was completely phonetic, and had a tradition of not separating words by spaces. Morphologically it was highly synthetic, and it had a great capacity to form large compound words. Thus clustering was highly frequent, and it is Sanskrit loanwords to the Gujarati language that are the grounds of most clusters. Gujarati, on the other hand, is more analytic, has phonetically smaller, simpler words, and has a script whose orthography is slightly imperfect (a-elision) and separates words by spaces. Thus evolved Gujarati words are less a cause for clusters. The same can <b>be</b> <b>said</b> <b>of</b> Gujarati's other longstanding source of words, Persian, which also provides phonetically smaller and simpler words.|$|E
