5|$|The Isinglass/Rheinberry {{concept was}} {{considered}} to be superior to spy satellites in a number of ways, including rapid turnaround time and quick response capability.

Virtually every town had a brothel where female and male prostitutes could <b>be</b> <b>had.</b> Male catamites fetched a higher price than female concubines since pederasty with a teenage boy was seen as a mark of elite status, regardless of sodomy being repugnant to sexual norms. Public bathing became much more common than in earlier periods. Urban shops and retailers sold a variety of goods such as special paper money to burn at ancestral sacrifices, specialized luxury goods, headgear, fine cloth, teas, and others. Smaller communities and townships too poor or scattered to support shops and artisans obtained their goods from periodic market fairs and traveling peddlers. A small township also provided a place for simple schooling, news and gossip, matchmaking, religious festivals, traveling theater groups, tax collection, and bases of famine relief distribution.|$|E

5|$|Cerezeda finally set {{out with}} his {{expedition}} to the interior but was forced to return when Díaz de Herrera attempted to abandon Trujillo, taking all the colonists with him. Trujillo was now {{at the point of}} collapse; the Spanish lacked essential provisions, and although more Spanish soldiers had come to Honduras than were needed to overthrow Peru, the bitter Spanish infighting had resulted in the almost complete collapse of the colony. Trujillo was the only Spanish settlement left in the territory, and possessed less than 200 Spanish inhabitants. The Spanish assaults upon the native population had wreaked havoc upon them, but failed to successfully conquer any territory outside the immediate environs of Trujillo. The native population level collapsed, with many Indians being sold as slaves to supply the workforce on the plantations of the Caribbean islands. In 1533, an epidemic swept through the natives within the reduced Spanish area of control, killing half their number. The encomienda system was dysfunctional in the colony, with little tribute, and no rich mines of silver or gold. Many colonists had heard of the riches to <b>be</b> <b>had</b> in Peru, and threatened to leave. By 1534, the only richly inhabited native region left was the Naco valley; in desperation, Cerezeda once again planned to move the colony west to Naco.|$|E
5|$|Critical {{reception}} of the 2014 live-action film was generally negative among Japanese and Western film critics, especially following the film’s showing at LA EigaFest. Areas frequently targeted for criticism were Ryuhei Kitamura's direction, the film’s supporting characters, screenplay, cinematography and editing (especially in the action scenes), costume design and soundtrack. The film was also criticized for having most of the its dialogue performed in English (resulting in poor delivery and intonation of numerous lines by its Asian cast members), and for overall squandering its potential as an adaptation of Monkey Punch’s manga. Shun Oguri, Tetsuji Tamayama, Gō Ayano, Meisa Kuroki and Tadanobu Asano were, however, frequently seen as well-cast in their respective roles. Audience opinions were mixed, with some viewing the film as “an enjoyable time to <b>be</b> <b>had</b> to the whole family”, while others viewed {{it as part of}} a “terrible live-action adaptation trend that has been going on through the years”.|$|E

The foundations of the walls were trenches full of damp concrete, drying in patches; the rooms--it was incredible they could ever be rooms--were shaped out as squares and oblongs of coarse, wet grass and sorrel.

5|$|Each year, {{thousands}} of outdoor enthusiasts attempt to summit Mount Adams. The false summits and broad summit plateau have disheartened many climbers as this inscription {{on a rock}} at Piker’s Peak indicates. “You are a piker {{if you think this}} is the summit. Don’t crab, the mountain was here first.” Crampons and ice axes are needed on many routes because of glaciers and the route’s steepness. Aside from crevasses on the more difficult glacier routes, the biggest hazard is the loose rocks and boulders which are easily dislodged and a severe hazard for climbers below. These falling rocks are especially dangerous for climbers on the precipitous east faces and the steep headwalls of the north and west sides. Routes in those areas should only be climbed early in the season under as ideal conditions as can <b>be</b> <b>had.</b> Other hazards faced by climbers on Adams include sudden storms and clouds, avalanches, altitude sickness, and inexperience. Climbing Mount Adams can be dangerous {{for a variety of reasons}} and people have died in pursuit of the summit while many others have had close calls.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} Afrikaners {{are a small}} group (10%) within the white {{minority}} group, Afrikaner recipes are popular. Biltong, a type of jerky, is a popular snack, prepared by hanging bits of spiced raw meat to dry in the shade. Boerewors is served with sadza. It is a long sausage, often well-spiced, composed of beef rather than pork, and barbecued. As Zimbabwe was a British colony, some people there have adopted some colonial-era English eating habits. For example, most people will have porridge in the morning, as well as 10 o'clock tea (midday tea). They will have lunch, often leftovers from the night before, freshly cooked sadza, or sandwiches (which {{is more common in}} the cities). After lunch, there is usually 4 o'clock tea (afternoon tea), which is served before dinner. It is not uncommon for tea to <b>be</b> <b>had</b> after dinner.|$|E

ANGAU established a native settlement in the Biding River area. By 13 February, 680 native labourers were at work.

ANGAU also carried out patrols, providing intelligence on the Japanese positions.|$|E

5|$|Turning {{into the}} wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers drop {{down onto the}} sands at low tide, the path follows {{the line of the}} sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for {{explosives}} manufacture for many years, the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path turns away from St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle. The water is crossed using an old railway bridge and then the old Hayle Railway is followed into the town centre then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to {{the west side of the}} tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can <b>be</b> <b>had</b> from Carnsew Pool at Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands.|$|E
5|$|Using {{a similar}} strategy, S. D. Malone and S. Bor {{analyzed}} the known intensities for the 1872 shock, then compared intensity patterns {{for a number}} of instrumentally recorded earthquakes that also occurred in the Pacific Northwest. A factor that was taken into consideration was that for earthquakes that have either circular or slightly elliptical isoseismal maps, the epicenter is usually close {{to the center of the}} pattern, but that for shocks where instrumental information are also available, the epicenter is sometimes not where it would have been assumed to <b>be,</b> <b>had</b> only the intensity information (and no instrumental information) been available. An isoseismal map of the 1949 Olympia earthquake was presented as an example of a distorted or convoluted pattern that was attributed to local geological conditions that either attenuated or amplified the seismic waves, and it was emphasized that not taking into account these local features could lead to a misinterpretation of the felt intensities and to a misplaced epicenter.|$|E
5|$|West {{points out}} that Kaifeng shopkeepers rarely had time to eat at home, so they chose {{to go out and}} eat at a variety of places such as restaurants, temples, and food stalls. Restaurant {{businesses}} thrived on this new clientele, while restaurants that catered to regional cooking targeted customers such as merchants and officials who came from regions of China where cuisine styles and flavors were drastically different than those commonly served in the capital. The pleasure district mentioned above—where stunts, games, theatrical stage performances, taverns and singing girl houses were located—was teeming with food stalls where business could <b>be</b> <b>had</b> virtually all night. West makes a direct connection between the success of the theatre industry and the food industry in the cities. Of the fifty some theatres within the pleasure districts of Kaifeng, four of these could entertain audiences of several thousand each, drawing huge crowds which would then give nearby businesses an enormous potential customer base. Besides food, traders in eagles and hawks, precious paintings, as well as shops selling bolts of silk and cloth, jewelry of pearls, jade, rhinoceros horn, gold and silver, hair ornaments, combs, caps, scarves, and aromatic incense thrived in the marketplaces.|$|E
