2500|$|Dry {{suits for}} {{commercial}} and military diving {{tend to be}} heavier and more durable than recreational diving dry suits because they will endure a harsh and abrasive environment, especially if being used for heavy labor such as underwater welding. A <b>boiler</b> <b>suit</b> may be worn over the dry suit for additional protection of the suit. Some commercial dry suits are rated for contaminated environment diving, and when combined with a suitably rated diving helmet can completely isolate and protect the diver from hazardous environments such as sewage pits and chemical storage tanks. These [...] "hazmat suits" [...] are most often made of vulcanized rubber laminated to a cloth liner, which is easier to decontaminate because of its slick surface, than other dry suit materials.|$|E

Boyce got as far as the Clogher Valley area, and while taking off his <b>boiler</b> <b>suit</b> in a ditch, he was captured by a Protestant farmer and his five sons, all of whom were heavily armed. He experienced some degree of police brutality following his capture, being [...] "cuffed about" [...] and forced to dress and undress in his wet clothes six times, before being transported back to Omagh to stand trial.
