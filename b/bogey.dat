5|$|During this period, no golfer {{suffered}} from the pressure of competing at Augusta more than Greg Norman. In 1987, Norman lost a sudden-death playoff to Larry Mize when Mize holed out a remarkable 45-yard pitch shot to birdie the second playoff hole and win the Masters. In 1996, Norman tied the course record with an opening round 63, and had a six-stroke lead over Nick Faldo entering the final round. Norman shot a 78 while Faldo scored a 67 to win by five shots (for his third Masters championship). Norman also suffered in 1986 when after birdieing four straight holes, and needing only a par to tie Nicklaus for the lead and force a Monday playoff, he badly pushed his 4-iron approach on 18 and missed his par putt for a closing <b>bogey.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once Australia's wartime {{military}} forces had been demobilised, the part-time force was re-established {{in the guise}} of the Citizens Military Force (CMF), which was formed in 1948. Within this, an amalgamated 16th/28th Battalion was raised. This battalion existed until August 1952 when, following the reintroduction of national service, the 28th Battalion was re-raised in its own right, based in East Perth with sub-units at Albany, Katanning and Geraldton. Heart of Oak was approved as the battalion's regimental march in 1953, but it was replaced the following year by Colonel <b>Bogey.</b> In 1960, following the introduction of the Pentropic organisation and the suspension of national service, this battalion was subsumed into the newly formed Royal Western Australia Regiment, providing three company-sized elements to the regiment's 1st Battalion (1 RWAR). The Australian Army ceased using the Pentropic organisation in July 1965 and at this time 1 RWAR was split into two smaller battalions: 1 RWAR and 2 RWAR. In early 1966, these were renumbered 16 RWAR and 11 RWAR, with the companies that had originally come from the 28th Battalion being allocated to 16 RWAR. In October 1966, when national service was reintroduced, the 28th Battalion was re-formed as a full battalion known as 28 RWAR, and fulfilling the role of a remote area battalion, catering for the training needs of men eligible for call up who wished to exercise the option to serve in the CMF instead of the Regular Army, but who could not parade regularly due to where they lived or what civilian occupation they held. The national service scheme ended in December 1972, after which many who had joined the CMF to defer full-time national service took their discharge. Numbers fell significantly and in 1977 the 28th Battalion was reduced to an independent rifle company, along with the 11th Battalion. This continued until October 1987, when the two companies were amalgamated to form the current 11th/28th Battalion, Royal Western Australia Regiment.|$|E

5000|$|The {{second round}} {{took place on}} 23 November and it was played in foursomes format. The amount of <b>bogeys</b> on the day almost septupled the amount from the 1st Round. A total of 83 <b>bogeys</b> were shot on the day {{including}} 8 double <b>bogeys,</b> one triple and one [...] "other". The New Zealand team shot a quintuple-bogey 9 on the par-4 14th hole. The lowest round on the day was a 4-under-par 68 which was shot by four different teams. 14 teams shot rounds of par or worse. After the first two days, no team has had a bogey-free 36 holes.|$|R

25|$|At the 2013 U.S. Open, Mickelson {{entered the}} final round leading by one stroke after rounds of 67-72-70 (−1) over the first three days, but he started {{the final round}} by three-putting the 3rd and 5th holes for double-bogeys {{to fall out of}} the lead. He regained the lead at the par 4 10th, when he holed his second shot from the rough for an eagle. However, a {{misjudgment}} at the short par three 13th saw him fly the green and make a <b>bogey</b> to slip one behind leader Justin Rose. Another <b>bogey</b> followed at the 15th, before narrowly missing a birdie putt on the 16th that would have tied Rose. Mickelson could not make a birdie at the 17th and after a blocked drive on the 18th, he could not hole his pitch from short of the green, which led to a final <b>bogey.</b>|$|E

50|$|Play {{began in}} the rain on Thursday morning, until play was {{suspended}} at 10:15 am, as several of the greens became unplayable with excessive water. Play was not restarted on Thursday, {{with the majority of}} players yet to tee off. Jeff Brehaut, through 10 holes, was one of four leading at 1-under par heading into Friday.

25|$|At the Open Championship Mickelson shot {{rounds of}} 70-72-70 {{to enter the}} final round eight shots behind outside the top 40. In the final round Mickelson birdied the 15th hole to move to 10 under and within two of the lead. After a missed 10 foot birdie putt on 16, Mickelson hit his drive on the infamous road hole 17th at the famed Old Course at St Andrews onto a 2nd floor balcony of the Old Course Hotel. The out of bounds drive lead to a triple <b>bogey</b> 7 that sent Mickelson {{tumbling}} out of contention.|$|E
25|$|Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson both posted {{rounds of}} 65 (−5) {{to share the}} lead after the first round.

Stenson, meanwhile, birdied four of his last five holes to tie Johnson for the lead. Jordan Spieth, the reigning Masters champion, was three strokes back after a 68. Three-time champion Tiger Woods opened with a round of 80 (+10), his worst score ever at the U.S. Open. Brian Campbell, a senior at the University of Illinois, was low amateur after a round of 67 (−3), two behind the lead.|$|E

Westwood attempted to follow him in close to the hole but got too much backspin on his pitch and the ball spun back into the water hazard. Westwood eventually chipped up from the drop zone and went on to make double <b>bogey.</b> Donald then holed his birdie putt to win the championship and in the process became the new world number one.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August, age 22, McIlroy won the 2012 PGA Championship by {{a record}} eight strokes, which {{was done with}} a birdie on the final hole. The record stood since Jack Nicklaus won the 1980 PGA Championship by seven strokes. McIlroy started the final round with a three stroke lead and shot a <b>bogey</b> free 66 {{to run away from}} the field. With this win, McIlroy became, at that time, the {{youngest}} multiple major champion since Seve Ballesteros won the 1980 Masters Tournament, and at that time, the sixth youngest of all time. The win also helped McIlroy regain the world number one ranking.|$|E
25|$|On 17 June {{during the}} second round, McIlroy became the first player {{in the history of}} the tournament to reach a score of 13-under-par at any point in the tournament. He {{achieved}} the feat by making birdie at the 17th hole in the second round. Despite a double <b>bogey</b> on the final hole, his two-day total of 131 (65-66, 11-under-par) set a record as the lowest 36-hole total in U.S. Open history. The score was one better than Ricky Barnes' 132 in 2009. He was also the fastest golfer to reach double digits under par in the U.S. Open, reaching 10 under par in 26 holes.|$|E
