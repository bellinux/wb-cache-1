500|$|Gerard George Lowe {{came from}} Johannesburg, South Africa. He was a {{chemical}} engineer with South African Breweries. He went to Singapore {{to shop for}} electrical and electronic goods. Before he left Johannesburg on 7 March 1995, he told his wife Vanessa, a local airlines employee, his exact schedule, saying: [...] "I will call you the moment I check into the hotel {{to give you the}} contact number. If you do not hear from me on 10 March, it would mean that I would have a seat on the plane to return to South Africa and would arrive home on 11 March. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> call you on 10 March, that would mean that I have not managed to get a seat and would return on 12 March." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Do {{not believe}} me unless I do what my Father does. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> it, {{even though you}} do not believe me, believe the miracles, that you may know and {{understand}} that the Father is in me, and I in the Father." ...|$|E
60|$|THE DOCTOR. [Shaking his head] I {{can report}} on {{him if you}} like; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> I ought to report on others.|$|E
60|$|GEORGE. In {{point of}} fact I wasn't {{thinking}} of giving you rubies, even reconstructed, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> can't think you'd be so indelicate as to sell them.|$|R
60|$|I was perplexed. I {{had half}} {{a mind to}} mention Mr. Harrison's name, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that, the man might expect {{altogether}} too much.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Mr Gresham, what {{on earth}} do you mean? In all human {{probability}} I shall never write another line to Mr de Courcy; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> what possible harm could it do you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not? You {{are very}} close in inquiring into my secrets. Tell me, Laura;--was not this young Crichton once a lover of your own?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I am {{loath to}} disturb {{the effect of a}} really {{touching}} story; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not occasionally give instances of these conceits, my translations will belie my criticism.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Is that my lesson? Must I say all at once? 'Twere a good lesson If I {{did love}} you, sir; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not, What shall I say then? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> Oh yes; you may laugh; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> {{not think}} that I {{could be a good}} wife to him I would not take his hand even to become Duchess of Omnium." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Matlack, {{speaking}} slowly, [...] "I {{may have}} had them feelin's, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> they must have struck in, and not {{come out on the}} skin, like measles, where I could see 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Here {{you have}} {{him as he}} was; {{he knew how to}} be so generously {{encouraging}} as to make a scrupulous man hesitate on the brink of confidence; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> hesitate it was not for long.|$|R
6000|$|COADE (an {{artist to}} the tips). Hope not? Odd! If {{he is doing}} neither I am not likely to notice him, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> what name shall I say? ...|$|E
60|$|CAESAR. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not get to}} work, Pothinus and {{the rest}} of them will cut us off from the harbor; and then the way from Rome will be blocked.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Monsieur,' he cried, in {{excellent}} French, 'I surrender myself {{on a promise}} of quarter. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not have your promise, I will then sell my life as dearly as I can.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's nonsense. I'm not {{thinking}} of Sophia Furnival {{any more than you}} are. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it would be a proper marriage. Now--" [...] And then he went on with some further very sage remarks about Miss Snow.|$|R
6000|$|... "To be sure, I might {{seize the}} rope and pull her down low enough so that she might safely drop; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that the tiger might also jump. Oh, what a {{position}} to be in, for one who loves! ...|$|R
60|$|It was Hatherleigh's poster and his {{capacity}} for overstating things, I think, that first qualified my simple revolutionary enthusiasm. Perhaps also I {{had met with}} Fabian publications, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>I</b> forget the circumstances. And no doubt my innate constructiveness with its practical corollary of an analytical treatment of the material supplied, was bound to push me on beyond this melodramatic interpretation of human affairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, it has: I'll {{not deny}} my name, {{and if there}} be {{absolute}} need I will pay it; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> so, my lawyer shall sift it, and it shall go before a jury." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now he's {{one of the}} Eighty-first, and I'd gladly {{let that}} poor blade [...] know that we've all that man can wish for here--good wine and buxom [...] women. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> we shan't have room for ourselves--hey? ...|$|E
6000|$|Warn. But, if I live, I'll cry quittance with him: he {{had engaged}} {{me to get}} Mrs Millisent, your daughter, for him; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not all I can to make her hate him! a great booby, an {{overgrown}} oaf, a conceited Bartlemew-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Gudeman," [...] quo' he, [...] "put up your whittle, [...] I'm no {{designed}} to try its mettle; [...] <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> wad be kittle [...] To be mislear'd; [...] I wad na mind it, no that spittle [...] Out-owre my beard." ...|$|R
60|$|This was {{interesting}} news. Perhaps I {{could get the}} man to take me back with him. Of course he would take me <b>if</b> <b>I</b> hired him in the regular way, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> this, <b>I</b> was certain he would charge me a small fortune.|$|R
6000|$|... "I love you, {{and because}} I love you I believe in you. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not believe, still should I love. Had {{you come back}} for me, and had there been no other way, I would have gone into the jungle with you--forever." ...|$|R
6000|$|His assent was instant. [...] "You {{think it}} not quite like me? You are right. It does {{sound a little}} lurid. I may never write it, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> you may be sure it will be treated {{in my own way}} and not in Hawthorne's way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Very good. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{this for}} you, {{you must do}} {{something}} for me. Say, Magepa, does Cetewayo really mean to fight, and if so, how? Oh yes, I know all you have been telling me, but I want not words but truth from the heart?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you had it}} you wouldn't be content. You'd want to {{pull down}} the house and build a bigger one. It's what I shall do some day, I suppose. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{it will never be}} so pretty again. I suppose that fellow will petition; won't he?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{can you do}} to stop it?" [...] she {{retorted}} defiantly, [...] "Give me religion---I guess you'd tell me. Religion's {{all right}} for those on top, but say, it would be a joke <b>if</b> <b>I</b> got it. There ain't any danger. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> it wouldn't pay room-rent and board." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I don't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it or not," [...] went on Shadow, {{his face}} as red as ever. [...] "I didn't know I took those postage stamps and those class pins that time. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> take 'em,--and we don't find 'em--I'll buy new shoes for all hands, if it takes every dollar I can scrape up." ...|$|R
5000|$|I {{belong to}} no {{organizations}} {{of any kind}} whatever, never go out socially, not interested in politics, and hate radios. I really ought to move to California, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> the Mormons would say they ran me out of Utah--so I stay just to spite them. (Pony Express Courier, June, 1937) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she answered, most {{unexpectedly}} to me, [...] "I {{will try}} to see her. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> see her, and she refuses to tell me anything about your daughter, what will you do? Of course, I shall {{have to tell her}} I come from you, and for you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Sir Launcelot, [...] "since thou hast besought me upon my knighthood I cannot do else than spare thee. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> spare thee, {{thou shalt}} {{have to endure}} such shame that any true knight in thy stead would rather die than be spared in such a manner." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Do not grieve over it, father,' {{answered}} the prince. 'It is nothing so dreadful after all! I will {{find some way}} to force Kostie√Ø to give up his rights over me. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not come back in a year's time, you must give up all hopes of ever seeing me.' ...|$|E
5000|$|He {{was offered}} a small role in the HBO boxing movie, Infamous, as a fighter who loses a match against the film's protagonist, played by John Leguizamo. Salita turned down the part. [...] "It was tempting, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> that, {{a lot of people}} who never saw me fight would see me lose." ...|$|R
6000|$|Maxwell {{shook his}} head. [...] "He doesn't mean this {{any more than}} he meant to revise the thing himself. He {{probably}} finds that he can't do that, and wants me to <b>do</b> it. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it he might take it off after the first night in Chicago if the notices were unfavorable." ...|$|R
60|$|The air of {{the place}} was now getting too much for me; but I stood deliberating a moment, whether it was {{possible}} for me to drag them out of the vault. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> what then? They would only perish in the street, and here they were at least protected from the rain; and more than that, might die in seclusion.|$|R
