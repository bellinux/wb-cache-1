50|$|The Eastern League of 1916-32 was a mid- {{to higher}} {{classification}} league, beginning in 1916 as a Class <b>B</b> <b>circuit</b> and upgraded to Class A in 1919. Its president, Tim Murnane, a former sportswriter, {{and many of}} its original member clubs were inherited from the New England League, which ceased operation in 1915. While most of its teams were centered in New England and upstate New York, in its later years the Eastern League admitted teams from Pennsylvania and Virginia. The league consisted of eight teams annually during its existence. The New Haven franchise, owned and operated by George Weiss from 1919-29, won four of its 17 championships — though under multiple nicknames. Weiss would go on to a Baseball Hall of Fame career as a top executive with the New York Yankees.|$|E
50|$|The Titans' {{first season}} {{of play in}} the RMLL Junior <b>B</b> <b>circuit</b> was {{successful}} as the team compiled an 11-7-3 record, good enough for third place. The Titans were eliminated from the playoffs first round by the Calgary Mountaineers, who in turn eventually claimed the RMLL Junior B Championship. The inaugural season was not without controversy as the Titans' home opener was marred by criminal charges that were laid against Titans player Jeff Benuik. These were in regards to a fight that occurred between him and Edmonton Warriors rookie Cam Ritchie. The charges against him were eventually dismissed. Also, the Titans were shorted a home game by the Calgary Mountaineers due to the Calgary Flames' playoff run in 2004. The Mountaineers were fined and forfeited the two points to the Titans.|$|E

50|$|In 1946, the Mexican National League {{was founded}} {{and joined the}} ranks of Organized Baseball as a Class <b>B</b> <b>circuit.</b> The league {{included}} six franchises that represented Mexico City (Aztecas), Chihuahua (Dorados), El Paso (Tejanos), Saltillo (Peroneros), Torreón-Gómez Palacio (Laguneros), and Ciudad Juárez (Indios). Unfortunately, {{it was to be a}} short-lived experiment because of competition from an independent Mexican League. This operation, bankrolled by Mexican entrepreneur Jorge Pasquel, placed franchises in two of the same cities, Mexico City and Torreón, forcing the Class B competition to fold. As a result, the MNL México and Torreón clubs retired in late April and the remaining of the league collapsed on May 27, just when Juárez and Chihuahua were tied in first place with a 23-21 record. After that, the outlaw Mexican League also became a threat to Major League Baseball for the rest of the decade.|$|E
5000|$|In 1946 {{with the}} postwar {{baseball}} boom, the New England League was restored to an [...] "affiliated" [...] eight-team, Class <b>B</b> <b>circuit,</b> but {{only half the}} teams had ties to a major league organization. Four of the six 1945 New England League teams made the crossover to so-called organized baseball in 1946: the Pawtucket Slaters (Boston Braves), Lynn Red Sox (Boston Red Sox), Cranston Chiefs (Independent) and Lawrence Millionaires (Independent). They were joined by the Manchester Giants (New York Giants), Nashua Dodgers (Brooklyn Dodgers) and 2 other independent teams: the Portland Gulls and Fall River Indians. Its most notable member, the Nashua Dodgers, was a Brooklyn farm club where, in 1946, African-American players and future Dodger greats Don Newcombe and Roy Campanella made their debuts {{as part of the}} handful of men who broke the baseball color line. The players succeeded on the field and were very complimentary in remarks about their Nashua experience in later years. It should be noted, however, that they faced taunts and racial epithets in visiting ballparks, even though New England was far removed geographically from the supposed locus of racial tension, the Southern United States.|$|E

In so doing, we introduce nondeterministic Turing machines. Lecture 2 presents alternation, a surprisingly-useful generalization of nondeterminism. Using alternation, we define more complexity classes, and inject clarity into a confusing situation. In Lecture 3 we present a few of the most beautiful results in computational complexity theory. In particular, we discuss (a) the algebraic approach to circuit complexity, (<b>b)</b> <b>circuit</b> lower bounds, and (c) derandomization...|$|E

It includes a Fleck 3 b [26] circuit board and an off-the-shelf OOK receiver QwikRadio [27] circuit board. The OOK receiver includes the image reject filter, amplifier, AGC, and OOK demodulation. The OOK receiver circuit board includes the impedance matching, band pass filter for OOK receiver. The demodulation bandwidth's configuration can be adjusted through jumpers and capacitors in the OOK receiver circuit board. The demodulation bandwidth is set at 6.85 kHz with 22 nF and 1 μF capacitors. The crystal, the reference clock at 14.29983 MHz for all the OOK receiver's internal circuits, provides the carrier frequency at 916.5 MHz.

40|$|Epidermis and neural tissues {{differentiate}} from the ectoderm in animal embryos. Although epidermal fate {{is thought to}} be induced in vertebrate embryos, embryological evidence has indicated that no intercellular interactions during early stages are required for epidermal fate in ascidian embryos. To test this hypothesis, we determined the gene regulatory circuits for epidermal and neural specification in the ascidian embryo. These circuits started with Tfap 2 -r. b and Sox 1 / 2 / 3, which are expressed in the ectodermal lineage immediately after zygotic genome activation. Tfap 2 -r. b expression was diminished in the neural lineages upon activation of fibroblast growth factor signaling, which is known to induce neural fate, and sustained only in the epidermal lineage. Tfap 2 -r. b specified the epidermal fate cooperatively with Dlx. b, which was activated by Sox 1 / 2 / 3. This Sox 1 / 2 / 3 -Dlx. <b>b</b> <b>circuit</b> was also required for specification of the anterior neural fate. In the posterior neural lineage, Sox 1 / 2 / 3 activated Nodal, which is required for specification of the posterior neural fate. Our findings support the hypothesis that the epidermal fate is specified autonomously in ascidian embryos...|$|E
40|$|A {{simple and}} {{complete}} USB interface package {{has been developed}} together at the hardware, firmware and software levels. It targets the development of boards and test benches, permitting an easy access from a computer through a simple USB cable. The hardware {{is based upon the}} FT 245 <b>B</b> <b>circuit</b> from the FTDI Company. The latter being indeed only a « byte pipe », a simple and effective encapsulation frame protocol has been developed in order to distinguish between the different bytes. The goal is to propose a « plug and play » system comprising the hardware interface on the board, the decoding block to be integrated within a FPGA on the user side and the graphical software interface on the computer. Libraries for LabView and C code are thus available. The FPGA internal interface on the user side is simplified, proposing an 8 -bit parallel bus with a 7 -bit sub-address and the few necessary control lines. Interruptions are also managed. This project offers all the different types of functioning of usual data acquisition systems, which may be triggered either from the computer or from the peripheral side. Because of its simplicity and transparency for the user, it is already used on a lot of different acquisition boards and test benches in the nuclear and high energy physics domain.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Bioactive Carmeda® heparin-coated extracorporeal {{circuits}} (ECCs) {{have been}} shown to reduce contact phase and coagulation activation during cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Heparin coating is therefore effective in safely reducing coagulation during routine CPB. Balance® Biosurface is a new, recently developed biopassive coating containing negatively charged sulphonated polymers. This study sought to compare the clotting activation and thromboresistance of the Balance® (<b>B)</b> <b>circuit</b> with that of the Carmeda® (C) with full-dose systemic heparin (FDH) and reduced-dose systemic heparin (RDH). METHODS: This ex vivo study set-up comprising 40 experiments consisted of simplified ECC and circulation of freshly donated human blood. RDH and FDH regimens were obtained with 0. 5 IU/ml and 1 IU/ml heparin administered to reach target activated clotting times (ACTs) of 250 and 500 s, respectively. The study design comprised four groups: FDH-C, FDH-B, RDH-C and RDH-B (all n = 10). Blood was sampled prior to and during the 2 -h CPB. Coagulation activation was assessed (FXIIa, F 1. 2) and electron microscope scan imaging of oxygenators enabled determination of adhesion scores. RESULTS: With a biopassive compared with bioactive surface, mean ACT was lower, regardless of the heparin regimen applied (P < 0. 001), whereas the total heparin dose required to maintain ACT was above target level (P < 0. 001). However, FXIIa and F 1. 2 values were similar in all groups throughout, as were pressure gradients among oxygenators. All groups demonstrated similar adhesion scores following ultrastructural oxygenator assessment. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of surgical-related haemostatic disturbances and based on target ACT levels under reduced- or full-dose heparin, the clotting process was similar to heparin-coated and new sulphonated polymer-coated ECC, both demonstrating similar thromboresistance...|$|E
