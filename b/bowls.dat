5|$|The ACC's {{representatives to}} these <b>bowls</b> were picked in a {{hierarchical}} system {{that allowed the}} Chick-fil-A Bowl to have the first selection after the Orange Bowl's automatic pick of {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game. Following the Chick-fil-A Bowl were the Gator Bowl, Champs Sports Bowl, Music City Bowl, Meineke Car Care Bowl, Emerald Bowl, and Humanitarian Bowl, in that order. The ACC's agreement with the <b>bowls</b> dictated that the <b>bowls</b> would select the highest-ranking ACC team left after the <b>bowls</b> with higher selections made their pick. <b>Bowls</b> would be allowed to skip the highest remaining team only if the next team was within one conference win of the highest remaining team. Therefore, a bowl could select a 53 team over a 62 team, but could not select a 44 team over a 62 team.|$|E
