40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} a typical clinical case of tuberous sclerosis complex (<b>Bourneville</b> <b>disease)</b> and discuss controversial issues about the management of this rare condition, with a short revision of the literature. Particularly, we define which is the role of the surgeon in the treatment of this very rare condition, that should be primary approached conservatively...|$|E
40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} (TS), {{also known}} as <b>Bourneville</b> <b>disease</b> or Bourneville-Pringle disease, is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder classically characterized {{by the presence of}} hamartomatous growths in multiple organs. TS and tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) are different terms for the same genetic condition. Both terms describe clinical changes due to mutations involving either of the two genes named TSC 1 and TSC 2, which regulate cell growth. The diagnosis of TSC is established using diagnostic criteria based on clinical and imaging findings. Routine screening and surveillance of patients with TSC is needed to determine the presence and extent of organ involvement, especially the brain, kidneys, and lungs, and identify the development of associated complications. As the treatment is organ specific, imaging plays {{a crucial role in the}} management of patients with TSC...|$|E
40|$|Background: Tuberous Sclerosis (TSC) {{also known}} as <b>Bourneville</b> <b>disease</b> is a neurocutaneous {{syndrome}} having an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, though the condition has {{a high rate of}} spontaneous mutation. It is the second most common neurocutaneous syndrome after neurofibromatosis. This disease demonstrates a widespread potential for hamartomatous growths in multiple organ systems. Case Report: We report a case of a 36 -year-old female with TSC presenting as massive hematuria with underlying giant bilateral renal angiomyolipomas (AML) with estimated total tumor burden of more than 8 kg which is {{to the best of our}} knowledge the highest ever reported. The patient also had lymphangioleiomyomatosis and lesions in the brain, skin, teeth and bones. Conclusions: TSC has a wide variety of clinical and radiologic manifestations. It should be suspected when some of the common radiological manifestations are found, including CNS involvement, renal and hepatic AMLs and LAM, even if clinical signs are not obvious. Renal AMLs in setting of TSC may reach giant proportions and may present with massive hematuria...|$|E
40|$|Primary heart {{tumors are}} {{exceptional}} in infants and children. Most common is the rhabdomyoma, {{often associated with}} tuberous sclerosis (<b>Bourneville's</b> <b>disease).</b> This tumor is generally believed to have no hemodynamic effects {{in the majority of}} cases. Recently, severe obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract by a solitary tumor was diagnosed during pregnancy and emergency surgery was needed soon after birth...|$|R
40|$|Phacomatoses {{represent}} {{a group of}} congenital and familial diseases, characterized by neuromesodermal, neuroectodermal or atypical disorders. The primary lesion sites in the connective tissue, affecting the organogenesis. <b>Bourneville's</b> <b>disease</b> or the tuberous sclerosis, is a rare congenital disease, with autosomal dominant inheritance with irregular penetration. The essential pathology is the appearance of multiple tumors with various sites: brain, heart, kidneys, skin, eye ball. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Tuberous {{sclerosis}} (TS) {{is one of}} {{the important}} neurocutaneous syndrome with a variety of clinical manifestations. We present a 19 years old boy with classical triad of Tuberous sclerosis who had seizure, mental retardation, facial angiofibromas and also having other features which cover the newer diagnostic criteria’s. TS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patient of seizure with mental retardation. Tuberous sclerosis (TS) or <b>Bourneville’s</b> <b>disease</b> is an autosomal dominant neurocutaneous syndrome classicall...|$|R
2500|$|TSC {{first came}} to medical {{attention}} when dermatologists described the distinctive facial rash (1835 and 1850). A more complete case was presented by von Recklinghausen (1862), who identified heart and brain tumours in a newborn who had only briefly lived. However, Bourneville (1880) is credited with having first characterized the disease, coining the name [...] "tuberous sclerosis", thus earning the eponym <b>Bourneville's</b> <b>disease.</b> The neurologist Vogt (1908) established a diagnostic triad of epilepsy, idiocy, and adenoma sebaceum (an obsolete term for facial angiofibroma).|$|R
2500|$|The name, {{composed}} of the Latin tuber (swelling) and the Greek skleros (hard), refers to the pathological finding of thick, firm, and pale gyri, called [...] "tubers", in the brains of patients post mortem. These tubers were first described by Désiré-Magloire Bourneville in 1880; the cortical manifestations may sometimes still be known by the eponym <b>Bourneville's</b> <b>disease</b> (...) or Bourneville–Pringle <b>disease</b> (after <b>Bourneville</b> and John James Pringle). The full name of [...] "tuberous sclerosis complex" [...] is preferred among medical professionals and researchers today because the disease has manifestations outside of the brain. Furthermore, the name reduces confusion with tuberculosis, a more well-known disease.|$|R
