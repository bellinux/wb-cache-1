500|$|The {{first known}} {{recording}} of [...] "My Immortal" [...] {{was made for}} the band's self-titled EP, which solely featured Lee's vocals accompanied by a piano, and slightly different lyrics. The song was cut from the EP before it was released. In 2000, the song was re-recorded for the band's demo album, Origin, which contains a rearranged piano melody and lyrics, including the bridge added by Lee. It was again recorded for the band's debut full-length debut studio album, Fallen where the vocals of the demo version (that were recorded by Lee at 18 years old) were accompanied by slightly different instrumentation. It is also featured on the band's 2003 EP, Mystary, {{which is much more}} similar to the band version. Wind-up Records preferred the Origin version, which is why the exact vocals recorded from 2000 are again included in the song's album version. The version that was recorded and released as a single is moderately alternative to that of the album version, and {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "band version" [...] because of the additional band performing the bridge and final chorus of the song. The later pressings of Fallen contain the single version (or [...] "band version") of [...] "My Immortal" [...] as a hidden track. Lee expressed some dissatisfaction with the early versions of the song saying, [...] "It's not even a real piano. And the sound quality is bad <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> break into the studio to record it late at night when no one was around because we couldn't afford a real session." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1981, Adam & the Ants {{released}} another {{highly successful}} album, Prince Charming. The album featured two United Kingdom No.1 singles – [...] "Stand and Deliver" [...] {{and the title}} track [...] "Prince Charming" [...] – {{as well as the}} No.3 UK hit [...] "Ant Rap". This trio of singles was promoted by some of the most lavish music videos of the period and paved the way for Adam Ant's later acting career. The work schedule Adam Ant imposed upon himself was punishing. [...] "I took no holidays – and I mean no holidays. When Kings of the Wild Frontier took off, I was halfway through making Prince Charming, and so on, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> bring out an album and four singles a year. But the price you pay... I split my cartilage in Cleveland doing [...] "Goody Two Shoes", it was my body saying, 'Look, no!' Then I was back onstage doing the Motown 25 [...] show 10 days later, having had the operation. Nobody could have stopped me, or make me do it. I did it. I was very, very bad at pacing," [...] he later remembered.|$|E

60|$|What is {{commonly}} called cheapness of labour, signifies, therefore, in reality, that many obstacles {{have to be}} overcome by it; so that much labour is required to produce a small result. But this should never be spoken of as cheapness of labour, but as dearness of the object wrought for. It {{would be just as}} rational to say that walking was cheap, because we had ten miles to walk home to our dinner, as that labour was cheap, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> work ten hours to earn it.|$|E
6000|$|It {{did seem}} strange {{enough to see}} a town again after what {{appeared}} to us such a long acquaintance with deep, still, almost lifeless and houseless solitude! We tumbled out into the busy street feeling like meteoric people crumbled off the corner of some other world, and wakened up suddenly in this. For an hour we took as much interest in Overland City {{as if we had}} never seen a town before. The reason we had an hour to spare was <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> change our stage (for a less sumptuous affair, called a [...] "mud-wagon") and transfer our freight of mails.|$|E
60|$|It {{would be}} hard to {{compress}} the story of a cold and luckless life, death, and burial into fewer words, or more impressive ones; at least, we found them impressive, perhaps <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> re-create the inscription by scraping away the lichens from the faintly traced letters. The grave was on the shady and damp side of the church, endwise towards it, the head-stone being within about three feet of the foundation-wall; so that, unless the poor man was a dwarf, he must have been doubled up to fit him into his final resting-place. No wonder that his epitaph murmured against so poor a burial as this! His name, as well as I could make it out, was Treeo,--John Treeo, I think,--and he died in 1810, at the age of seventy-four. The gravestone is so overgrown with grass and weeds, so covered with unsightly lichens, and so crumbly with time and foul weather, that it is questionable whether anybody will ever be at the trouble of deciphering it again. But there is a quaint and sad kind of enjoyment in defeating (to such slight degree as my pen may do it) the probabilities of oblivion for poor John Treeo, and asking a little sympathy for him, half a century after his death, and making him better and more widely known, at least, than any other slumberer in Lillington churchyard: he having been, as appearances go, the outcast of them all.|$|E
50|$|According to the University of New Hampshire's Crimes Against Children Research Center, {{stranger}} danger evokes more fear than abusers {{known to}} the child.

I feel a sort o' regret almost at leavin' it now. But {{the time has come}} for us to begin our voyage towards the Cape, and I need scarcely repeat what you all know well enough--that our undertakin' is no child's play. We shall need all our bodily and our mental powers to carry us through. Our labour must be constant, and our food is not sufficient, so that we must go on shorter allowance from this day. I gave you half rations while ye were buildin' the boat, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get her finished and launched as fast as we could, but now we can't afford to eat so much. I made a careful inspection of our provisions last night, and I find that by allowing every man four ounces a day, we can spin it out. We may fall in with islands, perhaps, but I know of none in these seas--there are none put down on the charts--and we may get hold of a fish now and then, but we must not count on these chances. Now it must be plain to all of you that our only chance of getting on well together in circumstances that will try our tempers, no doubt, and rouse our selfishness, is to resolve firmly before starting--each man for himself--that we will lay restraint on ourselves and try to help each other as much as we can." ...|$|E

5000|$|In 1996, half {{brothers}} Grant Thurmond and Cord Andrews {{and their}} friend Drew Abdalla were {{children when they}} watched Major League Soccer team Columbus Crew SC's first season. When the three men entered Ohio State University, they continued walking down Hudson Street to reach the stadium. Their enthusiasm for the team had not waned despite the soccer team's unexceptional performance which dissuaded people from attending their games. In 2006, to reinvigorate Columbus Crew SC's fan base, Thurmond, Andrews, and Abdalla formed the independent supporters' group Hudson Street Hooligans.

Godkiller creator Matt Pizzolo told Bloody Disgusting [...] "Godkiller was just a slower production than Watchmen <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> create 200 pages of art and story from the ground up first, rather than starting with one of the greatest comic books ever made as source material.
