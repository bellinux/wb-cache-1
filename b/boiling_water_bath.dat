40|$|Objective: The main {{aim of this}} {{investigation}} is the clinical application of ultrasound irradiation technique as an alternative method to reconstitute sestamibi kits in comparison of <b>water</b> <b>boiling</b> <b>bath</b> method. Methods: The 740 – 3700 MBq (20 – 100 mCi) 99 mTc-MIBI (sestamibi) complex samples were prepared due to ultrasound irradiation technique or <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> <b>bath</b> method as a standard method. Twenty patients (8 men and 12 women; age range 30 – 72, median 52. 45 years) have been referred to Golestan hospital for myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI). The subjects have been divided randomly into group A (3 men, 7 women, age range 36 – 67, median 51. 7 years) and group B (5 men, 5 women, age range 30 – 72, median 50. 3 years), respectively. The 99 mTc-MIBI radiopharmaceuticals have been prepared by Ultrasound irradiation technique administrated to group A and 99 mTc-MIBI complex samples due to the <b>boiled</b> <b>water</b> <b>bath</b> technique administrated to the other group. For all patients, the 2 -day stress/rest MPI protocol was performed. Results: The radio-HPLC and TLC {{studies have indicated that}} the 99 mTc-MIBI complex samples with good yields could be prepared successfully due to new developed technique. The scintigraphy imaging studies have demonstrated that the 99 mTc-sestamibi prepared due to the above-mentioned modalities shows very identical biodistribution in the heart, thyroid, lung, liver, gallbladder, kidneys, stomach, large intestine and bladder of the subjects. Any unexpected accumulation of radiotracer samples have not been observed in our approach. Conclusions: The ultrasound irradiation technique is convenient and sufficient method to prepare 99 mTc-sestamibi. It can be recommended as an alternative method to reconstitute sestamibi kits particularly in emergency situations to reduce potentially medical risk by avoiding any delay in acute therapy for myocardial infarction. © 2014, The Japanese Society of Nuclear Medicine...|$|R
40|$|What is {{a process}} review of a {{commercial}} food product? A process review of a commercial food product is a complete evaluation of how a food product is made, including all the steps of preparation, ingre-dients and packaging. Commercial canning of food has evolved from the closed kettle system developed by A. K. Shriver in 1874 —the first retort system, similar to a pres-sure cooker—to aseptic processing—the latest method, in which the food is sterilized, then pack-aged under sterile conditions. <b>Boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>baths</b> {{have been used for}} centuries but do not provide adequate heating to prevent microbial spoilage nor control Clostridium botulinum in low-acid food...|$|R

50|$|From {{a public}} safety point of view, foods with low acidity (a pH more than 4.6) need {{sterilization}} under high temperature (116-130 °C). To achieve temperatures above {{the boiling point}} {{requires the use of}} a pressure canner. Foods that must be pressure canned include most vegetables, meat, seafood, poultry, and dairy products. The only foods that may be safely canned in an ordinary <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>bath</b> are highly acidic ones with a pH below 4.6, such as fruits, pickled vegetables, or other foods to which acidic additives have been added.|$|E

Tom dumps Butch into a <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>bath,</b> but Butch kicks Tom into it and chases Jerry, in possession of the ham. After Butch bumps himself, he gains sympathy from Tom by pointing at Jerry and crying, but Jerry turns the tables and alerts Tom to Butch, who has now stolen everything in the refrigerator.

50|$|Applying high {{temperatures}} over a specified {{period of time}} can not only aid in the sterilization of the jars or cans used in packaging, but it can help maximize the storage time of the apple butter or other products. Boiling the jars will remove the oxygen remaining in the jar, which forms a tight seal between the lid and the rim. The heat used for this method of canning can be sufficient to kill bacterial cells found in the food. Only high-acid food with a pH of 4.6 or less can be processed using the <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>bath</b> method. This is because high-acid foods prevent the growth of spores of the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which can’t be killed by boiling.

40|$|Canning as {{a method}} of food {{preservation}} has its origin in the work of Nicolas Appert (1750 - 1841) who was the first to use heat as a means of preserving food in hermetically sealed containers. Although he did not understand the principles of his method, his systematic experimentation (and generous sharing of his discoveries) laid the foundations of thermal food preservation methods. Appert initially processed his food in cork sealed glass jars and bottles in <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>baths</b> for periods varying from 15 minutes to two and a half hours. Storage trials were the basis of his processing methods, some foods being kept up to ten years. His products ranged from meats, soups and vegetables to fruit and even cream and evaporated milk. He recognized the value of quick clean handling of good quality raw materials. Blanching was used with some products, and he was also aware of the distinction between acid and low-acid foods in regard to their length of processing. Appert's understanding of the process was that heating eliminated the "air" which was believed to be the cause of spoilage. This belief was to persist for nearly 100 years. Appert's work in glass containers led to the development in England about 1815 - 20 of tin containers for preserved foods. Appert himself used cans in some of his later work. Some time before 1830 the autoclave was introduced (apparently by Appert) as a means of cooking canned foods under pressure. By 1870, autoclaves were being used quite widely in industrial canning...|$|R

Briefly, protein samples were separated on 10 % polyacrylamide gels co-polymerized with 1 % Remazol Brilliant Blue linked to xylan (RBB-X), under denaturing conditions. Protein samples were resuspended in SDS sample buffer with 5 % (v/v) 2 -β-mercaptoethanol, then samples were <b>boiled</b> in a <b>water</b> <b>bath</b> for 5  min.

50|$|To analyze a grain sample {{it first}} {{needs to be}} ground to a powder; a flour sample can be {{analyzed}} as is. The sample is put into the test tube; distilled water is added, and the tube is then shaken vigorously to achieve a homogeneous mix. The tube is then placed in the <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>bath,</b> and the operator begins to stir the sample. Simultaneously the starch begins to gelatinize and the slurry becomes more viscous. The mixing ensures the gelatinization is homogeneous in the slurry, crucial for consistent test results. An additional effect of the high temperature is that the alpha-amylase enzyme contained in the grain begins to break the starch down into glucose and maltose, thereby reducing the viscosity of the slurry. The amount of starch break-down is directly proportionate to the alpha-amylase activity, meaning that the higher {{the activity of the}} alpha-amylase, the lower the viscosity will be.|$|E
50|$|Materials {{taken from}} victims, suspects, or {{the crime scene}} can also be tested to match {{locations}} of where the samples derived. Environmental products, such as mud, are placed in a test tube with a sulfuric acid and potassium dichromate solution for 24 hours. After centrifuging the tube, it is then placed in a <b>boiling</b> <b>water</b> <b>bath</b> for an hour. After the pellet is extracted it is mixed with distilled water and mounted on a slide with Hyrax. When diatom testing on an organic sample scientists use phase contrast microscopy. While observing the diatoms are tallied and organized based on their different species. The ratio of specific specimen of diatoms in the water will have a similar ratio to the sample that is taken from {{the site where the}} diatoms were transferred. Scientists use this to match materials and people to specific locations at a crime scene. An example of when this test was used was in Connecticut, July 1991. Two boys were fishing along a river when they were bound, beaten with a baseball bat, and attempted drowning by other three teenage boys. The boys escaped to go report the attack. Forensic scientists took the clothes of the victims and the clothes of the suspects that the boys had identified. At the College of Connecticut the samples taken from the clothing and crime scene underwent diatom testing and then analyzed. The observation of the samples showed that the ratios of algae populations from each sample were about 80% similar. The transfer function approach also was applied to this case and three specific species of Eunotia were considered unique to the crime scene. All three species were found in both the victim and suspect’s clothes. The results were then used to get confessions from the suspects.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} {{alkaline}} pretreatment and factors that affecting the enzymatic hydrolysis oil palm frond (OPF). The factors studied in enzymatic hydrolysis are enzyme concentration, pH, temperature, reaction time and agitation speed. OPF is {{one type of}} agricultural wastes that consist of lignocellulosic material which comprised of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Lignin is extremely strong component which resistant against chemical, enzymatic and bacteria breakdown. Thus, usage of lignocellulosic as a raw material involves alkaline pretreatment {{to be able to}} make the cellulose and hemicellulose fractions easily accessible for enzymatic hydrolysis. Dried OPF was pretreated by soaking into sodium hydroxide solution at 100 °C for about 1 hour. For hydrolysis, the pretreated OPF was soaked into sodium acetate buffer and enzyme was applied too. The, the mixture was incubated in an incubator shaker. After that, the mixture was <b>boiled</b> in <b>water</b> <b>bath</b> for 10 minutes. The hydrolysates were quantified by using DNS method.
