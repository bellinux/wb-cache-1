Miles of high cliffs make ideal raptor habitat, and the Metacomet Ridge is a seasonal raptor migration corridor. Because the topography of the ridge offers such varied terrain, many species reach the northern or southern limit of their range on the Metacomet Ridge; others are considered rare nationally or globally. Examples of rare species that live on the ridge include the prickly pear cactus, peregrine falcon, northern copperhead, showy lady's slipper, yellow corydalis, ram's–head lady's slipper, basil mountain mint, and devil's bit lily.|$|E
2500|$|The {{origin of}} Chauncey Peak and the Metacomet Ridge dates back 200 {{million years ago}} with the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia in the process that would {{ultimately}} create the Atlantic Ocean. In the area that is now the Metacomet Ridge and surrounding sedimentary rock basin, massive basalt (traprock) lava flows spread across the prehistoric rift valley, some of them several hundred feet thick, over a period of 20 million years. [...] Sediment accumulated between lava flows and lithified into sedimentary rock. [...] After the rifting processes ceased, layers of strata faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion, glaciation, and uplift exposed the weather resistant edge of the traprock lava sheets, creating the cliffline of the Metacomet Ridge as it is today. The mineral content and the shape of the ridge make possible a variety of microclimate ecosystems. Hot and dry cliff faces support plant and animal species uncommon so far north. Deeply gouged ravines support cooler climate species found in more northerly climes, while gradual <b>backslope</b> environments support species typical of the surrounding latitude. Talus slopes beneath cliffs accumulate minerals that support alkaline-loving plant species uncommon in surrounding acidic southern New England. Extensive cliffs provide ideal habitat and important migration corridors for raptor species.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} topographically {{controlled}} moisture redistribution underlies the conceptual model of soil development used by most {{researchers in the}} semi-arid northern Great Plains. The {{first part of this}} study explores the variability in the process of soil moisture redistribution, and its spatial distribution as it may be linked to topographic or pedogenic attributes. Recent advances in tillage research have shown that within cultivated landscapes tillage-induced redistribution of soils is the dominant erosion mechanism. The second part of this study attempts to validate the new model of tillage redistribution under Saskatchewan conditions. The redistribution of soil moisture was monitored on three occasions between June 1997 and October 1998 using the redistribution of a chloride tracer as a surrogate for moisture redistribution. The results of the chloride tracer provided clear evidence for the direction and magnitude of water flow during the study period. The results confirm the distinction in the moisture redistribution process between depression-centred soils and upland soils. The primary control on the movement of the tracer at depression-centred soils was spring flooding in early 1998. Subsequent redistribution of the remaining tracer was dominated by discharge phenomena. Subsurface flow in upland soils is clearly anisotropic, with observed differences in the degree of lateral and vertical redistribution of the chloride mass between landform elements and between soil profile classes. Two tillage experiments were conducted to evaluate the tillage process under Saskatchewan field conditions. The results of the tillage experiments were compared with the medium to long-term soil redistribution history as derived from cesium- 137 redistribution. The cesium- 137 results clearly show that the field-scale pattern of erosion at this Saskatchewan site corresponds to the characteristic pattern for tillage-induced erosion. Experimentally determined erosion values largely match or exceed those derived from the cesium- 137 redistribution. Cesium- 137 derived erosion rates for divergent shoulders, divergent <b>backslopes</b> and convergent <b>backslopes</b> were 42. 3, 32. 4, and 10. 8 Mg ha- 1 y-l, respectively. Experimentally determined values for net tillage erosion in these landform elements using a surface applied granular tracer and the median slope gradient for each category were 44, 74, and 86 Mg ha- 1 y-l, respectively. Net erosion values determined using an aqueous tracer applied to the soil surface had values of 16, 28, and 32 Mg ha- 1 y-l for divergent shoulders, divergent <b>backslopes</b> and convergent <b>backslopes</b> respectively. The comparatively low net erosion value for the divergent shoulder landform elements in the second experiment reflects the lack of a slope curvature factor in the erosion calculation. These results confirm that the redistribution of water and the redistribution of soil materials by tillage are the basic controls on the distribution of soil taxa in this landscape...|$|R

40|$|A multi-scale geomorphometric landform {{model was}} created {{through the use}} of fuzzy {{semantic}} import models and fuzzy overlay to measure distribution of landforms within parcels of the Conservation Reserve Program in a portion of the Delaware River Sub-basin in Northeast Kansas. Different fuzzy logic operators (intersect, algebraic mean, and fuzzy gamma) were used to test the impact of different model mechanisms on the resulting distributions of crisp and fuzzy membership values, and classification uncertainty measured by entropy values. Across scales (900 m 2 to 16, 900 m 2 window sizes), only one crisp class (drainages) showed an optimal scale for detection area. The statistical distribution of fuzzy membership values were significantly different between the same classes derived from different overlay operators, but this had limited impact on the agreement between crisp landforms derived from the three operators at a single scale. Within each pairing of overlay operator and scale, the landform classes <b>backslopes</b> and flats had the highest proportional representation of classes at most entropy levels (0. 95, 0. 90, 0. 85, and 0. 75) except for locations within the single-highest entropy level (0. 99), where the class proportions were more variable. This is significant, as both of these classes were dominant at different scales (<b>backslopes</b> at finer scales, and flats at coarser scales) within CRP Parcels. The fuzzy and multi-scale approach provides flexibility in assessing class-level uncertainty that had been previously unaddressed in the use of geomorphometric systems for mapping, modeling, and applied management applications...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Mortality {{of sugar}} maple (Acer {{saccharum}} Marsh.) has reached unusually high levels across northern Penn-sylvania {{since the early}} to mid- 1980 s. We evaluated the influence of glaciation, topographic position, foliage chemistry, defoliation history, and stand characteristics (species composition, structure, density) {{on the health of}} sugar maple in 43 stands at 19 sites on the northern Allegheny Plateau. Using percent dead sugar maple basal area as the measure of health, we found that all moderately to severely declining stands were on unglaciated summits, shoulders, or upper <b>backslopes.</b> Stands on glaciated sites and unglaciated lower topographic positions were not declining. The most impor-tant factors associated with sugar maple health were foliar levels of Mg and Mn and defoliation history. The lowest fo-liar Mg, highest foliar Mn, and highest number and severity of insect defoliations were associated with unglaciated summits, shoulders, and upper <b>backslopes.</b> Declining stands had less than- 700 mg·kg– 1 Mg and two or more moderate to severe defoliations in the past 10 years; both conditions were associated with moderately to severely declining stands. The decline disease of sugar maple seems to result from an interaction between Mg (and perhaps Mn) nutrition and stress caused by defoliation.
