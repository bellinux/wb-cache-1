5000|$|In Los Angeles, 1966, Lubahn was a {{founding}} member of the band Clear Light. Clear Light was originally formed by Bud Mathis as The <b>Brain</b> <b>Train.</b> After signing to Elektra Records, The <b>Brain</b> <b>Train</b> was renamed and Mathis was fired. Clear Light was the only album the band created before they split up. Their top song, [...] "Mr. Blue", has been referred to as [...] "long and a bit overbaked, but it does have an odd appeal". A review by Matthew Greenwald stated that they [...] "combined folk, rock, psychedelia, and even a touch of classical to their sound", continuing on to say that [...] "the end result, though, is a little ponderous and pretentious, but strangely listenable".|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Do <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> games work? The {{beneficial}} effects of <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> games {{are expected to}} transfer to other cognitive functions. Yet in all honesty, beneficial transfer effects of the commercial <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> games in young adults have little scientific basis. Here we investigated {{the impact of the}} <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> game (<b>Brain</b> Age) {{on a wide range of}} cognitive functions in young adults. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind (de facto masking) randomized controlled trial using a popular <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> game (<b>Brain</b> Age) and a popular puzzle game (Tetris). Thirty-two volunteers were recruited through an advertisement in the local newspaper and randomly assigned to either of two game groups (Brain Age, Tetris). Participants in both the Brain Age and the Tetris groups played their game for about 15 minutes per day, at least 5 days per week, for 4 weeks. Measures of the cognitive functions were conducted before and after training. Measures of the cognitive functions fell into eight categories (fluid intelligence, executive function, working memory, short-term memory, attention, processing speed, visual ability, and reading ability). RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: Our results showed that commercial <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> game improves executive functions, working memory, and processing speed in young adults. Moreover, the popular puzzle game can engender improvement attention and visuo-spatial ability compared to playing the <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> game. The present study showed the scientific evidence which the <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> game had the {{beneficial effects}} on cognitive functions (executive functions, working memory and processing speed) in the healthy young adults. CONCLUSIONS: Our results do not indicate that everyone should play <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> games. However, the commercial <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> game might be a simple and convenient means to improve some cognitive functions. We believe that our findings are highly relevant to applications in educational and clinical fields. TRIAL REGISTRATION: UMIN Clinical Trial Registry 000005618...|$|R
40|$|<b>Brain</b> <b>training</b> is a multi-million dollar market, with {{products}} that boast claims to enhance cognitive functions {{through the power}} of neuroplasticity. In this MA research I explore the experiences of individuals with an Acquired Brain Injury (ABI) who use <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> in an attempt to regain past identities or to create new and improved ones. The concept of neuroplasticity embedded in <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> programs represented hope to brain injured individuals: hope that they could regain skills that they have lost because of their injury. <b>Brain</b> <b>training</b> programs are also part of a larger theme of self-rehabilitation, in which individuals who were either neglected by the healthcare system or who wanted additional care turned to at-home treatments and programs. Finally, I argue that <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> fits with the dominant cultural imperative of health in North American society in which individuals must work to exercise self control and better themselves and their health in order to contribute to society...|$|R

5000|$|In 1966, The <b>Brain</b> <b>Train</b> {{formed and}} was managed by Sunset Strip hipster Bud Mathis.

50|$|The musical band of hippies led by McGuire was a Los Angeles {{rock group}} called Clear Light. They {{evolved from the}} band <b>Brain</b> <b>Train</b> and were just about to be signed to Elektra Records when they were cast in the film. They were, however, between vocalists (Cliff DeYoung joined them as singer after the film was made and was their lead singer on their sole album); McGuire played that part. The band only {{released}} one album and one single before breaking up, yet not only were they {{lucky enough to be}} cast in a film, but a few members actually had spoken lines. Reportedly, the role was originally offered to the Grateful Dead but they turned it down.|$|E
50|$|Buddy {{started the}} Sixth form at school after taking his GCSEs {{in the fourth}} year. In the common room he met fraternal twins Mike and Jason who also played guitar then he practiced {{with them in the}} school hall. They searched for a drummer and found an eighteen-year-old milkman called Glenn who joined them and they called the band the Reflections. The band mainly played at youth clubs and Buddy {{continued}} playing with the Hi-Tone Four without telling his parents hoping their gigs would not clash. One evening Buddy went with his mother to a meal with her boss Adrian Mandell who she was seeing a lot of. At one of the Hi-Tones' gigs Terry met a woman about fifteen years younger called Dawn who he saw lot of after that but Buddy thought negatively about her as he did with Adrian. When the clash between gigs finally happened Buddy had to tell his father about the Reflections and went there instead. Terry came to the Reflections' gig and met with them afterwards and they agreed to let him be their manager. Terry booked them a session at a recording studio where they made tapes to send to clubs to get bookings. Terry then booked them a tour over the Easter holiday within a hundred miles of their town so Terry and Glenn could go to work and changed the name of the band to Buddy and the Bosses. When Terry was going over the plans for the tour Buddy asked if he loved Dawn {{and he said that he}} liked her a lot but did not love her. When the band started performing at local youth clubs again there were two girls who went to the gigs and one of them asked Buddy out on a date. Buddy went with Elaine to the cinema where they kissed. After seven dates Elaine did not turn up and at the next gig she said it was because she did not want to get serious then he dumped her. Terry arranged to have a tour for Half-term in London and some other Southern cities, a recording session at a studio and a single in the local record shops. When Buddy went to tell his mother the news she said that her boss had been offered a job in London and wanted Carol to come with him. She asked Buddy what he thought but he left it entirely with her. Buddy thought he was going mad with the uncertainty of his future and wrote the song <b>Brain</b> <b>Train</b> about it. He also wrote Nothing Serious about Elaine.|$|E

40|$|Problem solving {{games are}} often advised in the {{behavioural}} therapy of fearful dogs. The {{aim of the}} current study was to assess their effectiveness in reducing fear in dogs. Dogs’ fear was evaluated through four subtests of the Dog Mentality Assessment (Fält, 1997; Svartberg & Forkman, 2002), focused on dog behaviour towards people. The first subtest consisted of a social contact with a stranger (test leader, TL) who approached the handler and then tried to walk the dog. In the second, another TL was hooded and encouraged the dog to play, moving and shaking a rope. In the third a manikin suddenly appeared in the dog’s path. In the last subtest a third TL spent 3 minutes talking to the dog handler without interacting with the animal. In each subtest a score varying from 1 (extreme fear) to 5 (no fear) was assigned by two trained observers. Dogs resulted fearful were divided into an experimental group (5 dogs, 2 males and 3 females, 45. 2 ± 23. 3 month old) and a control group (4 dogs, 2 males and 2 females, 61. 0 ± 48. 0 month old). The experimental group underwent problem solving sessions carried out by experimenters (different from TL) in a room, with games of increasing complexity, in which they had to gain the tasty food hidden by: upside down glass, bin, rolled towel, cage, twister, doggy <b>brain</b> <b>train</b> cube, roulette, inclined tube, and pull-the-plate. The number of sessions needed to solve all the games was 6. 6 ± 2. 6. Sixty day after the first test, all dogs were blindly assessed by repeating the Dog Mentality Assessment. Data was statistically analyzed by using a Wilcoxon test (p< 0. 05). Dogs of the experimental group statistically increased their scores after the problem solving sessions (16. 29 vs 21. 58; W= 91. 0; p< 0. 022), meaning that they appeared less fearful. Scores of the control groups did not show any change compared to the first trial. These preliminary data suggest that problem solving sessions where dogs are successful may be effective in reducing fear...|$|E

40|$|Background: While {{clinical}} {{evidence for the}} efficacy of <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> remains in question, numerous smartphone applications (apps) already offer <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> directly to consumers. Little is known about why consumers choose to download these apps, how they use them, and what benefits they perceive. Given the high rates of smartphone ownership in those with internet access and the younger demographics, we chose to approach this question first with a general population survey that would capture primarily this demographic. Method: We conducted an online internet-based survey of the US population via mTurk regarding their use, experience, and perceptions of <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> apps. There were no exclusion criteria to partake although internet access was required. Respondents were paid 20 cents for completing each survey. The survey was offered for a two-week period in September 2015. Results: 3125 individuals completed the survey and over half of these were under age 30. Responses did not significantly vary by gender. The <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> app most frequently used was Lumosity. Belief that a brain-training app could help with thinking was strongly correlated with belief it could also help with attention, memory, and even mood. Beliefs {{of those who had}} never used brain-training apps were similar to those who had used them. Respondents felt that data security and lack of endorsement from a clinician were the two least important barriers to use. Discussion: Results suggest a high level of interest in <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> apps among the U. S. public, especially those in younger demographics. The stability of positive perception of these apps among app-naïve and app-exposed participants suggests an important role of user expectations in influencing use and experience of these apps. The low concern about data security and lack of clinician endorsement suggest apps are not being utilized in clinical settings. However, the public’s interest in the effectiveness of apps suggests a common theme with the scientific community’s concerns about direct to consumer <b>brain</b> <b>training</b> programs...|$|R
