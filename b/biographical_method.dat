Julie Lewis has suggested that Kenneth's life and death:is to some extent responsible for Peter Cowan's <b>biographical</b> <b>method</b> and also the motivating force behind some of his fiction. The effect of isolation, of a hostile environment, of grief and emotional deprivation on a person's spirit {{and the ways in}} which an individual reacts to these things - mostly in control, but occasionally showing uncharacteristic violence - are recurring themes - for example - [...] "The Empty Street" [...] - a man driven by unseen forces reacts with violence.|$|E

Further, such lists of similarities between incidents in the plays and the life of an aristocrat are flawed arguments because similar lists have been drawn up for many competing candidates, such as Francis Bacon and William Stanley, 6th Earl of Derby. Harold Love writes that [...] "The very fact that their application has produced so many rival claimants demonstrates their unreliability," [...] and Jonathan Bate writes that the Oxfordian <b>biographical</b> <b>method</b> [...] "is in essence no different from the cryptogram, since Shakespeare's range of characters and plots, both familial and political, is so vast that {{it would be possible to}} find in the plays 'self-portraits' of ... anybody one cares to think of." ...|$|E

This work has become a classic in the psychiatric literature and many modern diagnostic criteria stem from ideas found within it. One of Jaspers's central tenets was that psychiatrists should diagnose symptoms of mental illness (particularly of psychosis) by their form rather than by their content. For example, in diagnosing a hallucination, {{it is more important to}} note that a person experiences visual phenomena when no sensory stimuli account for them, than to note what the patient sees. What the patient sees is the [...] "content", but the discrepancy between visual perception and objective reality is the [...] "form".|$|E

40|$|The feminist <b>biographical</b> <b>method</b> is an {{in-depth}} interpretive methodology that {{is useful for}} {{research in the field}} of psychology. I believe that this qualitative method is an excellent tool for analyzing individual narratives of participants ’ lives in relation to the larger cultural matrix of the society in which they live. Although an oral interview is often the primary strategy employed for data collection in this methodology, other sources of information such as personal journals, official documents, and cultural texts are also exciting additions to the research. The strengths of the feminist <b>biographical</b> <b>method</b> include the depth, context, and meaning found in the research; the inclusion of women’s experiences and voices in academic research; and the ability to conduct a sociopolitical analysis of potentially marginalized people. In this article, I delve into the feminist <b>biographical</b> <b>method</b> by providing discussion and examples from research in the field, as well as from my own research. I provide the reader with a personal narrative on “how-to ” conduct research using the feminist <b>biographical</b> <b>method.</b> In particular, I delineate the process of researching the lived experiences of women international students in difficult relationships.
