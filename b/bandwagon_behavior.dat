Key experimental results are reported to investigate the extent that <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> can be explained by other-regarding pref-erences in contrast to a psychological desire to simply support a winner. We 8 ̆ 5 nd support for purely psychological non-other-regarding <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> but primarily when subjects have information about the distribution of voter choices in previous elections but individual choices are private. Interestingly, when voting is public this type of <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> dis-appears and <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> that could be other-regrading is much higher. Given that observability increases other-regarding behavior in other contexts, our results suggests that some of the observed <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> may be explained by other-regarding preferences as well...|$|E

An econometric model that estimates the effects attests {{to the formation of}} <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> among network subscribers. It is shown that networks with a large subscriber base will recruit a disproportionately greater share of new users ceteris paribus compared with low-penetration operators. The strength of the subscriber bandwagon varies closely with the price differential of intra- and inter-network calls. Also, analysis of network traffic reveals that an average mobile phone user consumes considerably less inter-network than intra-network airtime; consequently, mobile phone use is largely clustered within respective networks and hindered from traversing others. Mobile networks Termination Bandwagon effects Taiwan...|$|E

For instance, of the 221 branches that were opened in New York City between July, 1990 and June, 1995, 181 (or 82 percent) were opened in census tracts that already {{had at least one}} other branch. A number of recent theoretical papers have highlighted the possibility of rational herding in various arenas of economic activity. This paper explores empirically whether the apparent clustering of bank branches can be at least partially attributed to rational herding by banks. We find that even after controlling for the expected profitability of operating a branch in an area, branch openings follow other, existing branches. Moreover, such <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> appears to reduce branch profits. These findings, combined, suggest that herd behavior may be a factor in the branch location decisions of banks. Branch banks...|$|E
50|$|Bandwagoning {{was coined}} by Quincy Wright in A Study of War (1942: 136) and popularized by Kenneth Waltz in Theory of International Politics (1979: 126) (in his work, Waltz {{incorrectly}} attributes Stephen Van Evera with coining the term). Both Wright and Waltz employ the concept {{to serve as}} the opposite of balancing <b>behavior.</b> <b>Bandwagoning</b> occurs when weaker states decide that the cost of opposing a stronger power exceeds the benefits. The stronger power may offer incentives, such as the possibility of territorial gain, trade agreements, or protection, to induce weaker states to join with it.|$|R

As variety of products to improve consumer surplus, researchers propose a new type of distribution; The Long Tail. In this study, to examine the Long Tail in non-digitals, a field study conducted in Turkey’s best-known on-line store. The results does not find a strong evidence for a long tail effect in the on-line Turkish SDA market. Flock toward rather cheap ones and price discounts is identified and an increase in interest in higher ranked products, a <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> was not experienced. The study finds that the main motivation in buying decision focused on price appeal not on design of products. Design played role for benchmarking and design related comments of the consumers mainly focused on appearance of products neither their usability nor functionality...|$|E
40|$|We study {{competitive}} capacity investment {{for the emergence}} of a new market. Firms may invest either in capacity leading demand or in capacity lagging demand at different costs. We show how the lead time and other operational factors including volume flexibility, existing capacity, and demand uncertainty impact equilibrium outcomes. Our results indicate that a type of <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> is the most likely equilibrium outcome: if both firms are going to invest, then they are most likely to act in unison. Contrary to much received wisdom, we show that leader–follower behavior is very uncommon in equilibrium where firms do not have volume flexibility, and will not occur at all if lead times are sufficiently short. On the other hand, if there is volume flexibility in production, then the likelihood of this sequential investment behavior increases. Our findings underscore the importance of operational characteristics in determining the competitive dynamics of capacity investment timing...|$|E
40|$|Allocating an IT Innovation {{budget to}} {{technologies}} in different maturity stages (mature vs. fashionable IT innovations) is a demanding task for companies. Due to the dynamic innovation cycles with new emerging technologies, many IT innovation investment decisions follow a <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> or fixed investment strategies. Instead of optimizing the IT innovation budget’s allocation to mature or fashionable IT innovations and following a mindful investment strategy, fixed strategies with naïve diversification are {{the rule in}} practice. To contribute to the decision making process regarding the IT innovation budget’s allocation, we aim on the optimized allocation to mature and fashionable IT innovations via a dynamic optimization model incorporating the idiosyncrasies of IT innovations and a company’s innovator profile. Though determining the optimum in practice seems to be virtually impossible, we argue that deviating above or below the theoretical optimum leads to a substantial difference regarding the IT innovation budget’s value contribution. For that we examine the valuation error resulting from under- or overinvesting in mature and fashionable IT innovations due to deviating from the theoretical optimum. By providing our ex ante dynamic optimization model and analysis we contribute to the decision making process regarding the engagement in new emerging IT innovations...|$|E
40|$|The U. S. -led War on Terrorism necessitated {{engagement}} strategies {{with several}} small states. The policy motivations of small states, however, are often overlooked. Kyrgyzstan {{is an interesting}} case as it offered an airbase for the U. S. -led campaign in Afghanistan, but also offered a similar arrangement to Russia. Thus, the motivation of the small state, Kyrgyzstan, is being evaluated in its engagement with two larger powers. This thesis argues that small state motivation revolves around how the state perceives the world it lives in. If the small state perceives a realist world, its behavior is commensurate with the capacity of small states in realist worlds. This leads to <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior</b> with larger powers, or balancing with larger powers against internal threats. If the small state views a complex interdependent world, then it uses what power it does have, like offering access to airbases, to leverage other benefits. Insight into small state perceptions allows U. S. policy makers to make realistic goals when formulating strategies with smaller countries. The data suggests Kyrgyzstan perceives itself {{to be in a}} moderate realist world, pursing policies to solidify its relationship with Russia while opportunistically reaping any short-term benefits from the United States...|$|E

Empirical evidence on mergers and acquisitions suggests that, under uncertainty, firms regret more not following their rivals’ merger moves of yet unknown outcome than possibly failing jointly by copying them. Looking for the rationale for this <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior,</b> we explore the underlying decision-making framework by using formal logic and search for behavioral premises consistent with the observed outcomes. We point 84942988966 out three biased expectations, modeled by using a belief modal operator, that filter out relevant scenarios from the consideration set of otherwise rationally behaving decision-makers. The theorems derived from the logic model highlight the drive to imitate competitors’ merger choices for {{all but one of}} the eight possible outcomes of the decision-making framework. For the latter case, a boundary condition is given that makes imitation the predicted strategy. Our approach goes against the view that human behavior defies logic-based rendering also if such behavior can be adequately described as non-rational in an economic sense. Logic is a flexible representation tool to model even faulty behavior patterns in a transparent way; it can also help exploring the consequences of the cognitive mistakes made. Our findings suggest that threats to wealth creation may not necessarily find their origins in morally questionable organizational behavior, but rather in modalities of decision-making under uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} relationship between vertical integration and market structure formation. It does so by combining the empirical industrial organization literature on vertical integration with that on market entry. The first empirical essay, Chapter 2, explores the motives for vertical integration in the US generic pharmaceutical industry. The industry {{is made up of}} numerous drug markets that open up to competition among generic manufacturers at different points in time. Each market consists of an upstream segment that manufactures active pharmaceutical ingredients, and a downstream segment that processes the active pharmaceutical ingredients into finished formulations and supplies them to final consumers. The econometric analysis shows that vertical integration in the generic drug industry is characterized by <b>bandwagon</b> <b>behavior.</b> While bandwagon effects have been widely discussed in the vertical integration literature, this study {{is one of the first}} to present empirical evidence on its existence. The analysis also indicates that vertical integration is partly driven by the need for a particular form of relationship-specific non-contractible investment [...] the early development of active pharmaceutical ingredients by upstream units. The relationship-specificity of such investments is greater in markets where generic firms try to enter by challenging the patents held by originator pharmaceutical companies. I find that in such markets, individual firms have a higher propensity to vertically integrate. The second empirical essay, presented as Chapter 3, introduces an econometric model of a vertical entry game. The model is used to estimate rival effects [...] the effect of rival entry on the post-entry profits of individual firms. These estimates allow us to make inferences about the competitive effects of vertical integration. Application of the model to the generic pharmaceutical industry yields the following result: vertical integration has significant efficiency effects that benefit unintegrated downstream firms. This implies that vertical integration is likely to be procompetitive from a static point of view. The parameter estimates are used to simulate the impact of a hypothetical policy that bans vertically integrated entry. The results indicate that such a ban tends to reduce the equilibrium number of downstream entrants. This suggests that the effect of vertical integration on market structure formation is also procompetitive...|$|E
