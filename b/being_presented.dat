5|$|In November 1944 Duff Cooper was {{appointed}} British ambassador to France and was provided accommodation at the Hôtel Le Bristol, where the Wodehouses were living. Cooper {{complained to the}} French authorities, and the couple were moved to a different hotel. They were subsequently arrested by French police and placed under preventive detention, despite no charges <b>being</b> <b>presented.</b> When Muggeridge tracked them down later, {{he managed to get}} Ethel released straight away and, four days later, ensured that the French authorities declared Wodehouse unwell and put him in a nearby hospital, which was more comfortable than where they had been detained.

When the lecture ends, Mulder is met by Dr. Heitz Werber, who is surprised to see that Mulder has lost his belief in alien life since the last time they met. Werber tells Mulder that he is Cassandra's doctor, and asks him to visit her.|$|E

40|$|Todays {{change of}} {{technical}} equipment in private households leads to altered domestic electric load profiles. This work investigates {{the change of}} residential electric load profiles when introducing PV, Air-Source-Heat-Pumps, CHP units and electric vehicles (EV). A modular modelling approach is presented, which allows for application on a larger scale, e. g. for simulations of distribution grid or gas and district heating network in residential areas. Results of a one year simulation for a representative German household show that load peaks can vary heavily between 4. 05 kW (PV <b>being</b> <b>present)</b> and 24. 67 kW (EV <b>being</b> <b>present),</b> i. e. depending on the technology present in a household. The net yearly elctricity demand varies from - 1 094 kWh (PV <b>being</b> <b>present)</b> to 14 936 kWh (ASHP <b>being</b> <b>present).</b> This information should be considered when discussing gird planing, energy supply and DSM concepts for residential areas...|$|R
5|$|Pennant {{received}} his early education at Wrexham Grammar School, {{before moving to}} Thomas Croft's school in Fulham in 1740. At the age of twelve, Pennant later recalled, he had been inspired {{with a passion for}} natural history through <b>being</b> <b>presented</b> with Francis Willughby's Ornithology. In 1744 he entered Queen's College, Oxford, later moving to Oriel College. Like many students from a wealthy background, he left Oxford without taking a degree, although in 1771 his work as a zoologist was recognised with an honorary degree.|$|E
5|$|Stefano Ghislotti {{wrote an}} article in Film Anthology which {{discusses}} how Nolan provides the viewer with the clues necessary to decode the sujet as we watch and {{help us understand the}} fabula from it. The color sequences include a brief overlap to help clue the audience into {{the fact that they are}} <b>being</b> <b>presented</b> in reverse order. The purpose of the fragmented reverse sequencing is to force the audience into a sympathetic experience of Leonard's defective ability to create new long-term memories, where prior events are not recalled, since the audience has yet to see them.|$|E

5|$|The {{constitution}} of Jordan grants its monarch {{the right to}} withhold assent to laws passed by its parliament. Article 93 of that document gives the Jordanian sovereign six months to sign or veto any legislation sent {{to him from the}} National Assembly; if he vetoes it within that timeframe, the assembly may override his veto by a two-thirds vote of both houses; otherwise, the law does not go into effect (but it may be reconsidered in the next session of the assembly). If the monarch fails to act within six months of the bill <b>being</b> <b>presented</b> to him, it becomes law without his signature.|$|E

5|$|After No.1 Long Range Flight was disbanded, Wing Commander Cuming {{returned}} to the ARDU. He was subsequently appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) on 31December 1953 for leading the flight and participating in the London-to-Christchurch air race. Squadron Leader Raw was also awarded the Air Force Cross {{for his role in}} the race, the decoration <b>being</b> <b>presented</b> to him by Queen Elizabeth II at Brisbane on 10March 1954. Raw had assumed command of No.2 Squadron on 18December; this was the first RAAF squadron to be equipped with Canberra bombers. Flight Lieutenant Francis Noel Davies, who had been Raw's co-pilot during the race, and two other airmen were killed on 16June 1954 when A84-202 crashed near Amberley. Wing Commander Cuming presided over the four-man court of inquiry which investigated the cause of this accident. As of May 2011, A84-201 was a gate guard at RAAF Base Amberley.|$|E
5|$|Certain Christian groups, {{most notably}} those in some King James Only denominations, {{consider}} {{all types of}} rock and metal music to be opposition to their faith, regardless of lyrical content or the lifestyles of the band members. However, fans and artists see metal as another genre of music, parallel to such genres as blues, classical, jazz, punk, and hip-hop. Bands such as Showbread and Antestor believe that the instrumentation of the music is simply a medium of art, while the person creating the music {{as well as the}} lyrics <b>being</b> <b>presented</b> provide the message. Therefore, Christian metal is created when Christians compose metal music in a way that reflects their faith in Christ.|$|E
