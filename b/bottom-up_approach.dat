5|$|Brachiopod fossils show great {{diversity}} in the morphology of the shells and lophophore, while the modern genera show less diversity but provide soft-bodied characteristics. Both fossils and extant species have limitations that {{make it difficult to}} produce a comprehensive classification of brachiopods based on morphology. The phylum also has experienced significant convergent evolution and reversals (in which a more recent group seems to have lost a characteristic that is seen in an intermediate group, reverting to a characteristic last seen in an older group). Hence some brachiopod taxonomists believe it is premature to define higher levels of classification such as order, and recommend instead a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach</b> that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the traditional classification of brachiopods into inarticulate and articulate, two approaches appeared in the 1990s: one approach groups the inarticulate Craniida with articulate brachiopods, since both use the same material in the mineral layers of their shell; the other approach makes the Craniida a third group, as their outer organic layer {{is different from that}} in either of the other two. However, some taxonomists believe it is premature to suggest higher levels of classification such as order and recommend a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach</b> that identifies genera and then groups these into intermediate groups. Traditionally, brachiopods have been regarded as members of, or as a sister group to, the deuterostomes, a superphylum that includes chordates and echinoderms. One type of analysis of the evolutionary relationships of brachiopods has always placed brachiopods as protostomes while another type has split between placing brachiopods among the protostomes or the deuterostomes.|$|E
5|$|Peter K. Bol {{asserts that}} the {{supporters}} of Wang Anshi's expansionist, activist central government in his New Policies were convinced that he understood the dao which brought utopia to Western Zhou (c. 1050 BC – 771 BC) antiquity and were determined to conform society according to his vision. The marginalised emperor – the last remaining aristocrat with any true political power – embraced the fiction that he was like the sage kings of old who brought society {{into a state of}} total harmony with court rituals and policy reforms. Yet after the reign of Emperor Huizong, Song rulers and officials alike disregarded the New Policies and focused instead on reforming society through a local, <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach.</b> For example, Emperor Huizong attempted from 1107–1120 to bar anyone who had not attended a government school from serving in public office. He thus rejected anyone who did not acknowledge his brand of Confucian ideology as orthodoxy. However, the government-run school system during the Southern Song eventually lost prominence to private academies, which had outnumbered government schools during the early Northern Song. Even before Emperor Huizong's reign, Sima Guang (1019–1086), a prominent chancellor and political rival to Wang Anshi, had little to say about the emperor's role in shaping major reforms and public policy, mentioning only that the emperor made major appointments when necessary.|$|E

50|$|<b>Bottom-up</b> <b>approaches,</b> in contrast, use the {{chemical}} properties of single molecules to cause single-molecule components to (a) self-organize or self-assemble into some useful conformation, or (b) rely on positional assembly. These approaches utilize {{the concepts of}} molecular self-assembly and/or molecular recognition. See also Supramolecular chemistry. Such <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approaches</b> should, broadly speaking, {{be able to produce}} devices in parallel and much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases.|$|R
30|$|In general, traffic {{models can}} be divided into two categories, namely <b>bottom–up</b> and top–down <b>approaches.</b> <b>Bottom–up</b> <b>approaches</b> start from {{individual}} vehicles and simulate their behavior to find aggregated macro-scale results. Most <b>bottom–up</b> <b>approaches</b> are micro-scale agent-based car-following models; prominent examples are the open source projects MatSIM [5] and SUMO [6] or the commercially available software VISSIM [7]. The downside of such detailed <b>bottom–up</b> <b>approaches</b> is that they need a lot of input data, in some cases complete origin–destination matrices, i.e., the complete information what vehicle drives from which starting point to which destination. In addition, their computation time is relatively high, so that calculation in real time may only be possible for small systems. A completely different approach is used for top–down models. Their starting point is the macro-scale, i.e., statistical information about traffic flow or other macroscopic properties. Such statistical models can, for example, be used to calculate emissions [8] very efficiently.|$|R

A set of approaches known as loosely coupled off-loading (LCOL) may be used in the attempt to characterize and copy the mental contents of a brain. The LCOL approach may take advantage of self-reports, life-logs and video recordings that can be analyzed by artificial intelligence. A <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach</b> may focus on the specific resolution and morphology of neurons, the spike times of neurons, the times at which neurons produce action potential responses.|$|E
25|$|In the 1970s, Norwegian {{sociologist}} Johan Galtung first {{created the}} term peacebuilding through his promotion of systems {{that would create}} sustainable peace. Such systems needed to address {{the root causes of}} conflict and support local capacity for peace management and conflict resolution. Galtung's work emphasized a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach</b> that decentralized social and economic structures, amounting to a call for a societal shift from structures of coercion and violence to a culture of peace. American sociologist John Paul Lederach proposed a different concept of peacebuilding as engaging grassroots, local, NGO, international and other actors to create a sustainable peace process. He does not advocate the same degree of structural change as Galtung.|$|E
25|$|These {{approaches}} {{utilize the}} concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation through a <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach.</b> The concept of molecular recognition is especially important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to non-covalent intermolecular forces. The Watson–Crick basepairing rules are {{a direct result of}} this, as is the specificity of an enzyme being targeted to a single substrate, or the specific folding of the protein itself. Thus, two or more components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.|$|E

30|$|ENM are {{produced}} in very diverse operations [16]. In general, the mechanical-physical top-down approaches {{can be distinguished}} from chemical-physical <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approaches.</b> In top-down approaches, ENM are made from larger materials through milling; in <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approaches,</b> ENM are synthesized from atoms, ions, or molecules in a chemical reaction. Milling operations are used for metallic or ceramic ENM with a relatively wide particle size distribution. Chemical-physical approaches have the advantage that the form {{and size of the}} particles can be better controlled. Possible reactions are precipitation and flame-, plasma-, or gas-phase synthesis.|$|R

25|$|In contrast, {{bottom-up}} techniques build or {{grow larger}} structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule. These techniques include chemical synthesis, self-assembly and positional assembly. Dual polarisation interferometry is one tool suitable for characterisation of self assembled thin films. Another {{variation of the}} <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach</b> is molecular beam epitaxy or MBE. Researchers at Bell Telephone Laboratories like John R. Arthur. Alfred Y. Cho, and Art C. Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s. Samples made by MBE were key {{to the discovery of}} the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded. MBE allows scientists to lay down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures. Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of spintronics.|$|E
25|$|American {{efforts to}} promote {{democracy}} {{in the region are}} generally characterized by top-down and bottom-up democratization strategies, which can be pursued simultaneously. The former top-down approach involves putting rhetorical and diplomatic pressure on regimes to reform and can {{go so far as to}} involve direct American military engagement installing democratic government (as is the case in Iraq following the 2003 invasion). The U.S. government generally pursues the latter <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach</b> by funding international organizations that help strengthen the bases for gradual democratic transition (the rule of law, accountable government institutions and expanded political competition) in the MENA region by offering technical assistance and training to political parties and electoral management bodies, engaging with civil society, producing assessments and polls, and promoting female political participation. Some have criticized American democracy promotion in MENA for ineffectiveness, a lack of consistency, taking a one-size-fits-all approach and using democracy to justify military intervention abroad. Moreover, It's said that US democracy promotion had been accompanied by heavy costs for US and considerable damage to the target countries.|$|E

2500|$|Deng's first reforms {{began in}} agriculture, a sector long {{neglected}} by the Communist Party. By the late 1970s, food supplies and production {{had become so}} deficient that government officials were warning that China was about to repeat the [...] "disaster of 1959", the famines which killed tens of millions during the Great Leap Forward. Deng responded by decollectivizing agriculture and emphasizing the household-responsibility system, which divided {{the land of the}} People's communes into private plots. Under the new policy, peasants were able to exercise formal control of their land as long as they sold a contracted portion of their crops to the government. This move increased agricultural production by 25 percent between 1975 and 1985, setting a precedent for privatizing other parts of the economy. The <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approach</b> of the reforms promoted by Deng, in contrast to the top-down approach of the Perestroika in the former Soviet Union, is considered an important factor contributing to the success of China’s economic transition.|$|E

40|$|Conservation {{conflicts}} tend to {{be highly}} complex, feed on uncertainty and affect people and organisations at different scales (Chapter 15). Traditionally, resolving these conflicts has been a ‘top-down’ process, led by governments and their official representatives, supported by scientifically trained specialists, with those affected by the conflict often relegated {{to the role of}} data-gatherers and passive recipients of information and instructions. These top-down conflict resolution processes typically seek the ‘right’ answer, as determined by national politics, laws or academic opinions. They are often framed in Western discourses about the intrinsic value of nature, over-riding older, more utilitarian values as ‘backward’ and ‘damaging’ (Zammit-Lucia, 2011). However, rather than resolve conflict, these top-down approaches have often inflamed conflict – for example, prompting violent protest or resettlement of protected areas by evicted communities (Brockington and Igoe, 2006). In contrast to this, it has been claimed that more <b>bottom-up,</b> participatory <b>approaches</b> to controversial conservation issues have the capacity to avoid, cope with or resolve conflicts. <b>Bottom-up</b> <b>approaches</b> to resolving conservation conflicts, it is argued, have the capacity to build trust and facilitate learning among stakeholders, who are then more likely to support project goals and implement decisions in the long term (Beierle, 2002; Reed, 2008). However, there are also many critics of <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approaches</b> to conservation conflicts. For example, problems with stakeholder representation or participatory process design mean processes fail to achieve their goals or exacerbate conflict (Stringer et al., 2007; Scott, 2011). As such, it has started to be recognised that the outputs (e. g. strategies, plans or other agreements) and ultimate outcomes (e. g. social learning, network forming, preference change, implementation of solutions) of <b>bottom-up</b> <b>approaches</b> to conservation conflicts are highly dependent on the selection of participants, the process design and the context in which they are conducted (de Vente et al., in press).
