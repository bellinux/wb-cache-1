50|$|With the Union Victory and {{occupation}} of the south, transport was administered by the US Army and Navy. The year 1864 brought an all-time low water mark on Upper Mississippi mark for all subsequent measurements. Stern wheelers proved more adaptable than side wheelers for barges.Immediately after the war, passenger steamboats become larger, faster and floating palaces began to appear; on the freight barges salt, hay, iron ore, and grain were carried. A few boats specialized in pushing huge log rafts downstream to lumber mills. By 1850, a system of moving barges and log rafts lashed alongside and ahead of the towboat was developed which allowed greater control than towing on a hawser. This type of service favored sternwheel propelled boats over sidewheelers and promoted other improvements as well. Towboats became a distinct type by 1860. Sand and gravel for construction was dredged up from river <b>bottoms,</b> and <b>pumped</b> aboard cargo barges. Simple hydraulic dredging rigs on small barges did the work.

40|$|In this study, {{we use a}} novel pan-Arctic sea ice-ocean coupled {{model to}} examine the effects of tides on sea ice and the mixing of water masses. Two 30 year {{simulations}} were performed: one with explicitly resolved tides and the other without any tidal dynamics. We find that the tides are responsible for a ? 15 % reduction in the volume of sea ice during the last decade and a redistribution of salinity, with surface salinity in the case with tides being on average ? 1. 0 – 1. 8 practical salinity units (PSU) higher than without tides. The ice volume trend in the two simulations also differs: ? 2. 09 × 103 km 3 /decade without tides and ? 2. 49 × 103 km 3 /decade with tides, the latter being closer to the trend of ? 2. 58 × 103 km 3 /decade in the PIOMAS model, which assimilates SST and ice concentration. The three following mechanisms of tidal interaction appear to be significant: (a) strong shear stresses generated by the baroclinic clockwise rotating component of tidal currents in the interior waters; (b) thicker subsurface ice-ocean and bottom boundary layers; and (c) intensification of quasi-steady vertical motions of isopycnals (by ? 50 %) through enhanced <b>bottom</b> Ekman <b>pumping</b> and stretching of relative vorticity over rough bottom topography.

40|$|Eutrophication {{is one of}} {{the most}} obvious and visible global {{environmental}} problem. The problems with eutrophication in Sweden is mainly in the south where agriculture has affected the areas for a long time. Skråmträsket is a lake in north of Sweden who has been affected from anthropogenic activities such as wastewater and runoff from agriculture. The lake has high phosphorus concentrations, originating both from catchment runoff and internal loading from the sediments. Skråmträsket have had algal blooms during the last 20 years. The municipality of Skellefteå and the local water group have collaborated during the last years to mitigate external sources of phosphorus, focusing mainly on the deepest area of the lake. This report’s a continuation of the work and investigates the internal loading of phosphorous in the lake sediments and possible actions to restore the lake. The internal loading tends to be more widespread than previously studies have shown, also the shallow sediment areas tend to show signs of internal loading. The conclusions are based on previous samplings from the lake including own sampling made for this report. As a complement is a literature study done to investigate more about possible methods to restore Skråmträsket. There are two possible methods to proceed with, aluminum treatment of the sediments or <b>bottom</b> water <b>pumping.</b> It’s important that the measure will be long-lived. Therefore, it is important to continue the samplings and expand the areas for sampling. The focus of the actions must include both the deep areas and the shallow areas of the sediment. ...|$|R
50|$|To {{extract the}} alginate, the seaweed is broken into pieces and stirred {{with a hot}} {{solution}} of an alkali, usually sodium carbonate. Over {{a period of about}} two hours, the alginate dissolves as sodium alginate to give a very thick slurry. This slurry also contains the part of the seaweed that does not dissolve, mainly cellulose. This insoluble residue must be removed from the solution. The solution is too thick (viscous) to be filtered and must be diluted with a very large quantity of water. After dilution, the solution is forced through a filter cloth in a filter press. However, the pieces of undissolved residue are very fine and can quickly clog the filter cloth. Therefore, before filtration is started, a filter aid, such as diatomaceous earth, must be added; this holds most of the fine particles away {{from the surface of the}} filter cloth and facilitates filtration. However, filter aid is expensive and can make a significant contribution to costs. To reduce the quantity of filter aid needed, some processors force air into the extract as it is being diluted with water (the extract and diluting water are mixed in an in-line mixer into which air is forced). Fine air bubbles attach themselves to the particles of residue. The diluted extract is left standing for several hours while the air rises to the top, taking the residue particles with it. This frothy mix of air and residue is removed from the top and the solution is withdrawn from the <b>bottom</b> and <b>pumped</b> to the filter.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Mining in Chingola Zambia started {{underground}} in 1931 and was catastrophically flooded and closed. The present Nchanga Underground Mine NUG {{started in}} 1937. The Nchanga Open Pit NOP mine started in 1955 situated {{to the west}} of NUG and partially overlying it. Open pit water control safety operations in the Nchanga-Chingola area have successfully enabled the safe extraction of millions of tonnes of copper ore annually over the past 60 years from NUG mining as well as the NOP. At the start Nchanga mining license surface already had NUG and many watershed divides with the Nchanga and Chingola streams being the main streams feeding into Zambias second largest river Kafue river and 42 of the year was characterised by heavy rains ranging between 800 mm to 1300 mm per annum. In this paper the presence of very significant amounts of seasonal rain and subsurface water in the mining area was identified as both a curse and a blessing. An excess in seasonal rain and subsurface water would disrupt both open pit and underground mining operations. In order for NOP to be operated successfully stable and free from flooding coping water management tactics were adopted from 1955 to 2015 including 1. Underground mine pump chamber pumping system 2. Piezometer instrumented boreholes 3. Underground mine 1500 -ft sub-haulage east borehole dewatering beneath the open pit 4. Nchanga and Chingola stream diversionary tunnel and open drains 5.

40|$|The MIEX® 1 Resin {{process was}} {{developed}} in Australia {{for the removal of}} natural organic material in water treatment. This novel, truly continuous ion exchange process, is based on the MIEX ® resin – a micro size, macroporous, strong base, magnetic ion exchange resin. The resin was specially developed for this application and optimised for reversible removal of negatively charged organic ions. The MIEX ® resin process uses mixed tanks for contacting resin with water. A very small amount of resin (5 - 10 mL settled resin per litre water) is used to exchange organics from water during 15 - 30 min detention time in a continuous, stirred tank reactor. After that, the resin is separated and treated water removed from the process for further treatment in a downstream settling unit. The gravity settling based resin separation is very efficient because of “magnetically ” enhanced agglomeration of individual resin beads, a process that yields resin agglomerates capable of settling against high water rise rate in the settler. Settled resin accumulates on the settler <b>bottom</b> and is <b>pumped</b> back to the contactor as concentrated slurry. Small amount of recycled resin is continuously removed for regeneration and replaced with regenerated resin. This general concept of the MIEX ® resin process is explained in detail in this paper and supported with results from a number of evaluation trials conducted in Australia...|$|R

Values of ostracode δ 18 O values suggest that about 16 cal ka the average annual air temperatures were about 11 °C colder than today. Carbon isotopic values from both species of ostracodes are similar during the Lateglacial and early Holocene, and show an overall decrease from − 4 ‰ to − 7 ‰ that is probably related {{to an increase in}} photosynthetic productivity in the water column, as suggested by an increase in organic carbon, delivering 13 C-depleted organic matter to the <b>bottom</b> waters (carbon <b>pump).</b> About 9 cal ka only L. mirabilis δ 13 C values decreased about − 2. 5 ‰ within 300 years.

40|$|The Gyro {{centrifugal}} pump {{developed as a}} totally implantable artificial heart was designed with a free impeller, in which the rotational shaft (male bearing) of the impeller was completely separated from the female bearing. For this type of pump, {{it is very important}} to keep the proper magnet balance (impeller-magnet and actuator-magnet) in order to prevent thrombus formation and/or bearing wear. When the magnet balance is not proper, the impeller is jerked down into the bottom bearing. On the other hand, if magnet balance is proper, the impeller lifted off the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pump</b> housing within a certain range of pumping conditions. In this study, this floating phenomenon was investigated in detail. The floating phenomenon was proved by observation of the impeller behavior using a transparent acrylic pump. The impeller floating phenomenon was mapped on a pump performance curve. The impeller floating phenomenon is affected by the magnet-magnet coupling distance and rotational speed of the impeller. In order to keep the proper magnet balance and to maintain the impeller floating phenomenon at the driving condition of right and left pump, the magnet-magnet coupling distance was altered by a spacer which was installed between the pump and actuator. It became clear that the same pump could handle different conditions (right and left ventricular assist), by just changing the thickness of the spacer. When magnet balance is proper, the floating impeller phenomenon occurs automatically in response to the impeller rev. It is called "the dynamic RPM suspension"...|$|R
40|$|The F-area pump {{tanks are}} used to {{transfer}} supernate, sludge, and other materials. In any transfer, the solution must stay well mixed without allowing particulate matter to settle out of the liquid and, thus, accumulate in the <b>bottom</b> of the <b>pump</b> tank. Recently, the pulse jet mixing in F-area Pump Tank 1 (FPT 1) has been decommissioned. An analysis of the liquid transfer through FPT 1 has been performed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methods to assess {{whether or not the}} velocities throughout the tank will remain high enough to keep all particulate suspended using only transfer and recirculation pumps. The following paragraph is an abbreviated synopsis of the transfer procedure for FPT 1 [1, 2]. Prior to a transfer, FPT 1 begins to be filled with inhibited water through the inlet transfer line (TI). When the tank liquid level reaches 52. 5 inches above the absolute tank <b>bottom,</b> the recirculation <b>pump</b> (RI and RO) is activated. At a tank liquid level of 72. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom, the outlet transfer line (TO) is activated to reduce the liquid level in FPT 1 and transfer inhibited water to H-area Pump Tank 7 (HPT 7). The liquid level is reduced down to 39. 5 inches, with an allowable range from 37. 5 to 41. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom. HPT 7 goes through a similar procedure as FPT 1 until both have tank liquid levels of approximately 39. 5 inches above the absolute tank bottom. The transfer of inhibited water continues until a steady-state has been reached in both pump tanks. At this point, the supernate/sludge transfer begins with a minimum flow rate of 70 gpm and an average flow rate of 150 gpm. After the transfer is complete, the pump tanks (both FPT 1 and HPT 7) are pumped down to between 20. 5 and 22. 5 inches (above absolute bottom) and then flushed with 25, 000 gallons of inhibited water to remove any possible sludge heal. After the flushing, the pump tanks are emptied. Note that the tank liquid level is measured using diptubes. Figure 2. 1 provides a simplified sketch (not to scale) of FPT 1 during the steady-state transfer condition, which consists of two inlet flows that impact the liquid surface as plunging jets and two outlet flows drawn from {{near the bottom of the}} tank. During the transfer, the supernate level is held at 39. 5 inches above the absolute bottom of the tank [1, 2]. In addition, the FPT 1 can contain up to 16. 7 wt. % sludge particles within the supernate for a given transfer [2]. Test results from Tank 40 sludge Batch 3 [3] provide a typical range of particulate diameters between 0. 1 and 25 {micro}m, with approximately 20 vol. % of the sludge distribution consisting of particles less than 1 {micro}m in diameter. The purpose of this analysis is to estimate FPT 1 flow field during the steady-state transfer conditions to ensure that the tank remains mixed and that the velocities throughout the tank are sufficient to keep all sludge particulate suspended...|$|R
40|$|The {{project is}} to design, {{implement}} and monitor a level control system in our case we will control the water level. To this end {{we begin with the}} design of a first metal structure which will be located at the glass tank 1 m eter in height at the top, and the reservoir of 40 cm in height at the <b>bottom.</b> The centrifugal <b>pump</b> will be on the reservoir, and the ultrasonic sensor, RF transmitter and 12 Vdc source on the glass tank. In the second structure will place a control panel which will ha ve a MicroLogix 1200 PLC Allen-Bradley, Analog Expander IF 2 OF 2, Variable Power Flex 4 Allen -Bradley,protect motor,RF module (receiver), control transformer, source 12 and 5 Vdc, pushbuttons, pilot light, 3 position selector, switches, terminal blocks. The control level of our educational system we will be controlled using a PID programmed into the PLC so as to enter the ultrasonic sensor signal (4 to 20 mA equivalent of 0 to 80 cm) from the tank glass, this signal will compared with the setpoint and set by the user. In this way generate an output signal (0 to 10 Vdc), to be connected to drive the analog input since this way they controlled the flow by varying the frequenc y. Revista Tecnológica ESPOL – RTE, Vol. 22, N. 1, (Diciembre, 2009) All this process we will monitor through a SCADA system, in our case we use intouch, which will control the liquid level, varying its setpoin...|$|R
30|$|The test {{facility}} consisted of mixer-viscometer, a gas addition system, a cooling system, a liquid charge system, cleaning solvent charge systems, and a data acquisition system. The gas charging system {{consisted of a}} pressurized gas bottle (usually 1800 psi), a pressure regulator, gas cooling bath and a mass flow meter. Operating pressure was preset using the pressure regulator. The gas through the preset pressure regulator was routed through an ice bath to cool it before it was metered. A Porter series 200 mass flowmeter was used to meter the flow rate and total volume of gas added to the vessel. The liquid charging system consisted of a simple funnel through which liquids {{were added to the}} vessel. The liquid charge could also be done using the cleaning system especially if it was desired to add liquid when the vessel was already pressurized. The cleaning and venting system consisted of a <b>pump,</b> <b>bottom</b> valve, drain trough and a vent. The pump could be used to draw liquid from the selected tank and send it to the vessel. The liquid could be a reactant or just cleaning solvent. The bottom valve was used to let in liquids into the vessel or drain from it. The drain trough was used to collect wastes after the experiments. The cooling system consisted of a chiller, the gas temperature control bath and a cooling jacket. The chiller was used to heat, cool or maintain temperature of the vessel contents. The gas temperature bath was intended to pre-cool the gas on hot days when the ambient temperatures were extremely high. The cooling jacket was the main heat exchange point between the chiller and the vessel contents. The shaft magnetic coupling was cooled to prevent heating due to friction. The mixing system consisted of a motor drive, torque sensor, and impeller. The vessel was 3.25 ″ internal diameter, 10 ″ height and rated for a maximum working pressure of 3000 psi. It was equipped with gas inlet and outlet valves, a sampling/drain valve at the bottom, pressure gage, safety/relief valve, and internal thermocouple. A ¼ HP variable speed motor was used to rotate the mixing shaft from 0 to 1900  rpm. A rotary shaft non-contact torque sensor model 01424 was used to measure torque directly from the shaft. A helical-blade impeller with two ¼ pitch blades was used for mixing vessel contents. The helical blades impeller was found to be more sensitive to viscosity change and hydrate formation during the trial tests. It also reduces the formation of a vortex during mixing. The process control and data acquisition system was developed using Factory Talk integrated suite software from Rockwell Automation. The recorded variables were shaft rotational speed, torque on shaft, chiller temperature, gas bath temperature, vessel temperature, vessel pressure, gas injection rate and totalized gas volume. A detailed description of the design, mathematical models, and calibration for this mixer-viscometer is published elsewhere (Bbosa 2015; Bbosa et al. 2017) Fig.  8 shows the Piping and Instrumentation Diagram (P&ID) for the setup. Figure  9 shows the schematic of the in-house mixer-viscometer used in characterization of hydrate slurries. Figure  10 shows the small-scale facility setup.|$|R
