40|$|In this study, Nathan Balke and Mine Yucel {{ask whether}} the Eleventh Federal Reserve District's <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> {{description}} contains timely information about economic activity within the District. They examine whether the <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> description tracks current Texas real gross state product (GSP) growth and current Texas employment growth. They also study whether the <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> has information about growth not present in other regional indicators {{that would have been}} available to analysts {{at the time of the}} Beige Book's release. They find that both the <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> summary and the average across sectors reflect Texas GSP and employment growth very well. These two measures of the <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> also have predictive content for one quarter ahead GSP growth. Balke and Yucel also find that the Eleventh District's <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> has information content for Texas economic activity over and above other state economic indicators such as Texas employment growth, personal income, or sectoral employment growth. Because the <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> is released at least one month earlier than employment data and at least two years before GSP data, its timeliness makes it a good tool for current regional economic analysis.

40|$|In making {{monetary}} policy, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) relies {{in part on}} the <b>Beige</b> <b>Book,</b> {{a report}} on regional economic conditions released publicly about two weeks before each FOMC meeting. The <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> summarizes economic conditions in each of the twelve Federal Reserve districts and provides an overview of national conditions based on the regional reports.; The Reserve Banks gather information for their regional summaries from a variety of sources, including telephone and written surveys, local news reports, and reports on current and expected economic conditions from the Reserve Banks' boards of directors. Some critics consider this type of anecdotal information too subjective to be of much value. However, recent research applying quantitative methods to <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> information shows that the reports provide a useful indicator of national and regional economic activity.; This article evaluates the relationship between the Sixth District (Atlanta) <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> and regional and state per capita employment, real personal income, and real gross state product growth. The analysis also compares the Atlanta <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> to next-quarter estimates of economic activity and examines whether it contains information about regional economic activity in addition to that contained in the national <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> summary. The authors find that, despite the Beige Book's anecdotal nature, the report provides timely, reliable information when actual data are not yet available, giving policymakers an early indication of the direction of the economy that helps them make informed decisions.

At the national level, pessimistic language in the national summary reflects the underlying business cycle phase, while optimistic language is informative for higher frequency fluctuations.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{explains}} how an in-class simulation of the FOMC meeting can effectively {{be used to}} teach various aspects of monetary policy in the U. S. economy to an upper-level monetary economics class. The class is divided into various groups which directly or indirectly participate in the FOMC meeting and {{in the conduct of}} the monetary policy. Over the semester these groups research different aspects of the U. S. economy and prepare the Green Book, the <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> and the Blue Book as they learn about money and how money affects the economy. They also learn how monetary policy actions of the Federal Reserve System translate into changes in money supply. By the semester end, the FOMC meets and deliberates over the information gathered by various groups, and takes a decision on the target interest rate. The groups are evaluated {{on the basis of the}} quality of their work. Group members evaluate each other for their participation, and their individual scores are then determined by combining the group evaluation and individual participation evaluation...|$|E
40|$|Managing text-based {{information}} is crucial {{when trying to}} extract valuable information from documents. Assigning a numerical value to the text-based (unstructured) {{information is}} one of the ways to extract value. This research studied the quantification of unstructured text and its forecasting power. In order to examine unstructured information that related to predictive models, the Beige Books were utilized to investigate and predict changes in the U. S. economy. The Beige Books describe current economic conditions and discuss fluctuations in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). To quantify the text-based unstructured information, the Direct Scoring Algorithm (DSA) was proposed. It utilized the keywords in the document and their subjectivelydetermined numerical weights to score individual sentence. Statistical analyses were then conducted to verify which sections of the Beige Books contributed the most significant information to the prediction of GDP. Utilizing the significant sections, a linear regression model was constructed to predict future GDP growth. The adjusted-R 2 values of the DSA model were compared to the scoring of the same documents by an economic expert. The comparison demonstrated that the DSA model using the <b>Beige</b> <b>Book</b> significantly contributed to the prediction of GDP, and it explained similar amounts of variance compared to the scores created by an economic expert. Also, a comparison between a structured predictive model and the DSA model was conducted to again prove the significance of text-based information. This positive result implies that there is more room for research in this area and that the ideas have future potential in the quantification of unstructured information. ...|$|E
