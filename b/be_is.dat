5|$|English verbs are inflected for {{tense and}} aspect, and marked for {{agreement}} with third person singular subject. Only the copula verb to <b>be</b> <b>is</b> still inflected for {{agreement with the}} plural and first and second person subjects. Auxiliary verbs such as have and be are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form complex tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in {{that they can be}} followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.|$|E
5|$|Most verbs {{have six}} inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, {{a third person}} {{singular}} present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund–participle and a past participle. The copula verb to <b>be</b> <b>is</b> the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first person present tense form is am, the third person singular form is and the form are is used second person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is been and its gerund-participle is being.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the forms}} <b>is</b> and <b>are</b> (of which the latter <b>is</b> anyway often {{replaced}} by <b>is)</b> can <b>be</b> omitted; <b>am,</b> <b>was,</b> and <b>were</b> <b>are</b> not deleted.|$|R

In the <b>be</b> + to construction only finite, indicative (or past subjunctive) forms of the copula can appear - that <b>is,</b> the copula used cannot <b>be</b> <b>be</b> itself, {{but one of the}} forms <b>am,</b> <b>is,</b> <b>are,</b> <b>was,</b> <b>were</b> (possibly contracted in some cases).|$|R

In that case, under the relevant statute, the authority could only issue a compulsory purchase order affecting the applicants' land if it was not part of, among other things, a park. A minister confirmed the purchase order but the Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that it should be quashed, finding that the minister could not exercise power to acquire the land since it was part of a park. Whether the land was or was not a park was {{a precedent}} fact, and the minister had committed an error concerning this fact.|$|E

In the confusion, Momohime's soul is kidnapped by the vengeful monk Rankai and Jinkuro is forced to follow Kongiku as Momohime's body will die if her soul is harmed. With her soul safe, Jinkuro sets out to regain the Dark Resurrection Demon Blade so he can properly utilize his Soul Transference Technique and gain influence through a new host.

Momohime forces Jinkuro to spare Yukinojo, even when she learns that Yukinojo's intentions in marrying her {{were part of a}} scheme to ruin her family as punishment for defying the shogun.

The Jennifer Ganger struggles with her new identity and befriends Rory who has begun to demonstrate an emotional attachment to her. The Cleaves Ganger works in secret with the other Gangers to try to kill the real humans, as the human Cleaves plans to kill the Gangers. The Doctor attempts to reunite the two sides but fails when the human Cleaves kills one of the Gangers with a high-powered electrical charge.
