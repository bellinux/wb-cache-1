5|$|To aid in his {{ministry}} to the Jewish people, Jesus {{was given the}} ability to perform miracles, <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> of God rather than by his own power. Through {{his ministry}}, Jesus {{is seen as a}} precursor to Muhammad. According to the Quran, Jesus was not crucified but was merely made to appear that way to unbelievers by Allah, who physically raised Jesus into the heavens. To Muslims, it is the ascension rather than the crucifixion that constitutes a major event in the life of Jesus. Most Muslims believe that Jesus will return to earth at the end of time and defeat the Antichrist (ad-Dajjal) by killing him in Lud.|$|E

5|$|All bovids mate {{at least}} once a year, and smaller species may even mate twice. Mating seasons occur {{typically}} during the rainy months for most bovids. As such, breeding might peak twice in the equatorial regions. The sheep and goats exhibit remarkable seasonality of reproduction, in the determination of which the annual cycle of daily photoperiod plays a pivotal role. Other factors that have a significant influence on this cycle include the temperature of the surroundinga, nutritional status, social interactions, the date of parturition and the lactation period. A study of this phenomenon concluded that goats and sheep are short-day breeders. Mating in most sheep breeds begins in summer or early autumn. Mating in sheep is also affected by melatonin, that advances the onset of the breeding season; and thyroxine, that terminates the breeding season. Estrus lasts for at most a day in bovids, with the exception of bovines and tragelaphines. Except the hartebeest and the topi, all bovids can detect estrus in females by testing the urine using the vomeronasal organ. Once the male is assured that the female is in estrus, he begins courtship displays; these displays vary greatly from the elaborate marches among gregarious species to the fervent licking of female genitalia among solitary species. Females, initially not receptive, ultimately mates with the male which has achieved dominance over others. Receptiveness is expressed <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> for mounting by the male and setting aside the tail by the female. Copulation generally takes a few seconds.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fourteenth}} century, owing to various causes {{such as the}} {{mitigation}} of the rule—either <b>by</b> <b>permission</b> of the pope, or through a lessening of fervour, but chiefly because of the Plague and the Great Western Schism—discipline became relaxed in the Augustinian monasteries; and so reformers emerged who were anxious to restore it. These reformers were themselves Augustinians and instituted several reformed congregations, each having its own vicar-general (vicarius-generalis), but all {{under the control of}} the general of the order.|$|E

In both countries and at Hong Kong, which he visited on the way, {{he was the first}} British prince to set foot in the country. The native rulers of India vied with one another in the magnificence of their entertainments during the stay of three months.

25|$|The current dome {{dates from}} 1870, {{although}} it was restored between 1994–1997, as part of extensive modern renovations to the church which have been ongoing since 1959. During the 1970–1978 restoration works and excavations inside the building, and under the nearby Muristan, {{it was found that}} the area was originally a quarry, from which white meleke limestone was struck. To the east of the Chapel of Saint Helena, the excavators discovered a void containing a 2nd-century drawing of a Roman ship, two low walls which supported the platform of Hadrian's 2nd-century temple, and a higher 4th-century wall built to support Constantine's basilica. After the excavations of the early 1970s, the Armenian authorities converted this archaeological space into the Chapel of Saint Vartan, and created an artificial walkway over the quarry on the north of the chapel, so that the new Chapel could be accessed (<b>by</b> <b>permission)</b> from the Chapel of Saint Helena.|$|E
