5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clonesâ€”multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin has noted that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, a {{new process}} based on GTAW was developed, called plasma arc welding.

Development within the GTAW process has continued as well, and today a number of variations exist.

5|$|Steel (with smaller {{carbon content}} than pig iron {{but more than}} wrought iron) was first {{produced}} in antiquity <b>by</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> bloomery. Blacksmiths in Luristan in western Persia were making good steel by 1000BC. Then improved versions, Wootz steel by India and Damascus steel were developed around 300BC and AD500 respectively. These methods were specialized, and so steel did not become a major commodity until the 1850s.|$|E
