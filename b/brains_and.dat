5|$|The amyloid {{hypothesis}} traditionally {{points to}} the accumulation of beta-amyloid peptides as the central event triggering neuron degeneration. Accumulation of aggregated amyloid fibrils, which {{are believed to be}} the toxic form of the protein responsible for disrupting the cell's calcium ion homeostasis, induces programmed cell death (apoptosis). It is also known that Aβ selectively builds up in the mitochondria in the cells of Alzheimer's-affected <b>brains,</b> <b>and</b> it also inhibits certain enzyme functions and the utilisation of glucose by neurons.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain of}} Deinocheirus was reconstructed through CT scans and {{presented}} at the 2014 Society of Vertebrate Palaeontology conference. The brain was globular and similar in shape to that of birds and troodontid theropods, the cerebrum was expanded in a way similar to most theropods, and the olfactory tracts were relatively large. The brain was proportionally small and compact, and its Reptile Encephalisation Quotient (brain-body ratio) was estimated at 0.69, which is low for theropods, and similar to sauropods. Other ornithomimosaurs have proportionally large <b>brains,</b> <b>and</b> the small brain of Deinocheirus may reflect its social behaviour or diet. Its coordination and balance {{would not have been}} as important as for carnivorous theropods. A bone microstructure study {{presented at the}} 13th Annual Meeting of the European Association of Vertebrate Palaeontologists in 2015 showed that Deinocheirus probably had a high metabolic rate, and grew rapidly before reaching sexual maturity.|$|E
5|$|The vintage de Havilland Tiger Moth {{appears as}} a scale model for {{sequences}} such as Alan and Tin-Tin's departure from Tracy Island and Brains' arrival on the top deck of Skyship One. The production team also decided to arrange a live-action location shoot in Buckinghamshire to star a full-sized biplane. Joan Hughes, an experienced pilot who had flown Supermarine Spitfires and Avro Lancasters from factories to airbases during the Second World War, was selected to fly the aircraft. Sequences that comprise live-action filming include Brains launching the Tiger Moth from a field to rescue the occupants of Skyship One, Penelope's subsequent struggle to control the aircraft, the gun battle with Foster's remaining henchmen, the near collisions with the motorway bridge and the exhaust tower, and the final crash-landing. For the later sequences, stunt dummies fixed to the Tiger Moth's wings and undercarriage represent the characters of Alan, Tin-Tin, Parker, <b>Brains</b> <b>and</b> the White Ghost agents, while Hughes doubles for Penelope in the cockpit. The location filming was based at Wycombe Air Park.|$|E

40|$|Aromatase catalyzes the {{conversion}} of androgens into estrogens. Data on native aromatase enzyme kinetics and thus actual catalytic activity are scarce in fish, impeding comparison of aromatase activity (AA) from different organs within and between species. In the present study, fluorescence aromatase assay was optimized to measure AA in the gilthead seabream (Sparus aurata L., 1758) using dibenzylfluorescein (DBF) as a fluorometric substrate in <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> liver microsomes. <b>Brain</b> <b>and</b> liver AA have showed linearity until 20 and 40 µg protein concentration throughout 30 minutes, respectively. In <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> liver optimum pH of the enzyme {{was found to be}} 6. 50 and 8. 25, respectively and optimum temperature was found to be 30 °C for both tissues. It has been observed that <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> liver AA have saturated at and above 2 µM DBF concentrations. Determined Vmax and Km values of <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> liver aromatase using LineweaverBurk graph have calculated 8, 054 ± 0, 550 and 8, 389 ± 0, 543 pmol/min/mg protein and 0, 840 ± 0, 161 µM and 0, 959 ± 0, 152 µM, respectively. Testosterone appeared to competitively inhibit the Sparus aurata <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> liver aromatase. In conclusion, the parameters of this assay that are reported for <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> liver aromatase in gilthead seabream could be useful to measure AA in other specie...|$|R
40|$|GnRH-like immunoreactive {{mast cells}} in the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> {{mesentery}} of the gerbil. Zoological Studies 41 (1) : 99 - 110. Mast cells affect the extracellular milieu {{through the process of}} degranulation. Recently, mast {{cells in the}} brain of the dove and certain mammals were found to express gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) -like immunoreactivity (IR). In the present study, we examine the expression of GnRH-like IR in <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> mesen-teric mast cells, and the degranulation of mast cells at these 2 sites after administration of compound 48 / 80 (C 48 / 80). The gerbil, in which numerous mast cells are found in the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> mesentery, was used as the experimental animal model. Both <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> mesenteric mast cells in control and C 48 / 80 -treated gerbils express GnRH-like IR. Mast cell degranulation was dramatic in the mesentery after C 48 / 80 was injected intraperitoneal-ly. Because newly extruded GnRH-like immunoreactive granules in the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> mesentery are compact, GnRH release can be classed as a rapid-release reaction. The degranulated mast cells were restored to their normal configuration in the <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> mesentery 12 h after C 48 / 80 treatment. We conclude that: (1) <b>brain</b> <b>and</b> mesenteric mast cells express GnRH-like IR, and (2) GnRH is released by a rapid-release reaction after C 48 / 80 administration...|$|R
25|$|The {{prenatal}} hormonal {{theory of}} sexual orientation suggests {{that people who are}} exposed to excess levels of sex hormones have masculinized <b>brains</b> <b>and</b> show increased homosexuality or bisexuality. Studies providing evidence for the masculinization of the brain have, however, not been conducted to date. Research on special conditions such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and exposure to diethylstilbestrol (DES) indicate that prenatal exposure to, respectively, excess testosterone and estrogens are associated with female–female sex fantasies in adults. Both effects are associated with bisexuality rather than homosexuality.|$|E
