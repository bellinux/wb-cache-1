The young lady has plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her forehead, and a lock of hair falls at the back in a ponytail. A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> {{the time that the}} Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E

40|$|<b>Beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the {{controllability}} of a stigma, and {{how they}} may influence identification with that stigma, have received little empirical attention. Thus, the current research sought to determine if <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the controllability of a stigma affected identification with a stigmatizing trait. Specifically, the current research investigated the moderating role <b>of</b> <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> controllability on identification with one's body. Results demonstrated that <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the controllability of weight moderated the relationship between perceived weight discrimination and body identification, while Body Mass Index moderated the relationship between <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> controllability and identification. Furthermore, participant gender did not influence these results. Implications are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{quality of}} {{teaching}} and learning in tertiary education contexts is influenced by many factors including the educational <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the university teachers and students who teach and learn in such contexts. Most belief research in the tertiary education sector has, to date, reported on the teaching or learning <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> just teachers or the teaching or learning <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> just students. Much less research has explored the connections between the educational <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> these two groups. This research has aimed to extend the parameters of previous research by investigating the point of intersection between the educational <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> a group of university teachers and their students. To attain this objective, the study adopted a mixed method approach which employed predominantly interpretivistic data gathering, data analysis and reporting methods. These methods incorporated elements of inductive and comparative analysis, and were augmented by other qualitative methods. Combined, these methods facilitated the identification, exploration and comparison <b>of</b> the educational <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the participants in the study...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} how self-construal as a sociocultural indicator relates to Singapore students’ incremental <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> ability and competitive and cooperative learning preferences, and the mediational role <b>of</b> incremental <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> ability {{in the relationship}} between self-construal and students’ learning preferences. A large sample of 2648 Singapore secondary students from 102 classes took measures of independent and interdependent self-construal, and about 3 months later they took measures <b>of</b> incremental <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> math ability and also competitive and cooperative learning preferences in their math study. We conducted multi-group confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling, and the results supported measurement and structural invariance between boys and girls. Interdependent self-construal positively predicted incremental <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> math ability, and incremental <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> math ability were positively associated with both competitive and cooperative learning preferences. Interdependent self-construal positively predicted cooperative learning preference both directly and through the mediation <b>of</b> incremental <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> math ability; it also positively predicted competitive learning preference indirectly through incremental <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> math ability. Independent self-construal directly predicted competitive learning preference positively. The findings and implications for classroom teaching are discussed in the academic context of Singapore...|$|R
5|$|The 10th Century Saint Conrad of Constance is {{sometimes}} {{represented as a}} bishop holding a chalice with a spider.

5|$|The <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> many {{followers}} {{that their}} founder was {{the incarnation of}} the Supreme God has also drawn criticism. According to Professor Raymond B.

Swaminarayan responded that he accepts gifts for the emancipation of his followers.|$|E
5|$|Gorman {{said that}} his Catholic {{grandmother}} had secretly married Albert Victor, and that his mother, as the legitimate daughter of Albert Victor, was the rightful heir to the throne. He claimed that the Ripper murders were staged {{as part of a}} conspiracy to hush up any potential scandal by murdering anyone who knew of the birth. In the original television series, the story is depicted as the <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> Gorman but not of the detectives. Captivated by Gorman's story, journalist Stephen Knight decided to investigate the claims further, and eventually published his research as the book Jack the Ripper: The Final Solution in 1976.|$|E
40|$|This short paper {{studies the}} problem of public persuasion, that is, when a sender has to persuade {{multiple}} receivers, possibly having heterogenous beliefs, with the same information for all.

This observation partially generalizes to targeted persuasion...|$|R

5|$|In Sri Lanka the <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> Riri Yaka (Blood Demon) can be found. According to mythology, he tore his mother's {{breast and}} emerged {{into the human}} world as a demon killing her. The demon is said to give a primary form and eight other manifestations. In most cases {{he is said to}} be a giant who towers over his human victims. In the primary form, his face is blue and splotched with blood. Red rays radiate from his bloodshot eyes. Blood pours from his {{nostrils}} and smoke billows from his ears. His mouth is filled with decomposing human flesh and his breath is foul. His entire body is coloured scarlet with dripping blood. He is closely associated with Mara, the demon king of death.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people of}} the {{district}} follow the traditions, customs and rituals. The district has many temples of Hindu gods and goddesses, which are ancient and have deep spiritualism attached to them. The people of Dakshina Kannada worship the serpent god Subramanya. According to legend, the district was reclaimed by Parashurama from the sea. Nagaradhane or snake worship is practiced according to the popular <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> the Naga Devatha to go underground and guard the species on the top. Rituals such as Bhuta Kola are performed to satisfy the spirits. Kambala, a form of buffalo race on muddy track in the paddy field, is organised in the 16 sites across the district. Cock fight (Kori Katta in Tulu) is another past time of the rural agrarian people.|$|E
5|$|The next year, {{he began}} {{printing}} with a partner, William Seres; the two based their {{operations at the}} parish of St Sepulchre in London. Day and Seres specialised in religious works, such as those by Robert Crowley, which were largely related to theological controversies of the time. The Protestant Reformation was advancing rapidly, and the laws against the publication of heretical works were being relaxed. In 1548, ten of the twenty works {{that the two men}} published were devoted to criticizing the Catholic <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> transubstantiation. One of those publications, a satirical poem by Luke Shepherd titled Iohn Bon and Mast Person, almost landed Day in jail. Day and Seres also translated important works of Continental Protestantism for the English market, notably Herman von Wied's A Simple and Religious Consultation in 1547.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the trauma {{sensitive}} <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> individuals who had never experienced an assault with the preassault and postassault <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> assault victims. Seventy-two individuals who had never experienced an assault completed a questionnaire designed to assess trauma sensitive beliefs (including beliefs about self-worth, safety and the trustworthiness <b>of</b> others). The <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> this group were then compared with the preassault and postassault <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> assault victims with persistent PTSD and assault victims who had never experienced PTSD, recruited for previous studies (Dunmore, Clark, and Ehlers, 1999, 2001). Results showed that victims who did not develop PTSD following assault reported significantly more positive preassault beliefs in comparison with those who had never been assaulted. The postassault <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the persistent PTSD group were significantly more negative than the <b>beliefs</b> <b>of</b> the never assaulted group and the no PTSD assault group. Findings support evidence that suggests a relationship between negative beliefs after assault and the development of PTSD. In addition, positive preassault beliefs might play a "buffering" role, minimizing the impact of assault for those assault victims who do not subsequently develop PTSD...|$|R

5|$|The {{teaching}} of evolution in American secondary school biology classes was uncommon {{in most of}} the first half of the 20th century. The Scopes Trial decision of 1925 caused the subject to become very rare in American secondary biology textbooks for a generation, but it was gradually re-introduced later and became legally protected with the 1968 Epperson v. Arkansas decision. Since then, the competing religious <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> creationism was legally disallowed in secondary school curricula in various decisions in the 1970s and 1980s, but it returned in pseudoscientific form as intelligent design (ID), to be excluded once again in the 2005 Kitzmiller v.

5|$|Book Four, The Alchemist, {{takes place}} in Samarkand, in the 17th century. An alchemist named Khalid, {{attempts}} to fool the Khan into believing that he has discovered the Philosopher's stone (which supposedly can turn Lead into Gold), but his fraud is uncovered and his hand is chopped off as punishment. Khalid becomes depressed and disenchanted with Alchemy (the prevailing <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> the scholars of the time) and decides to destroy all his Alchemical books (which come to Samarkand via the trade routes {{from all over the}} known world). However, his friends Iwang (a Tibetan Buddhist mathematician) and Bahram (a Sufi blacksmith) instead convince him to test the veracity of the claims in the books and thus see if there is any true wisdom to be gained. They devote themselves to practical demonstrations and experiments that greatly improve knowledge of various aspects of physics, chemistry, mathematics, biology, and weaponry, and in the process create the scientific method. Their discoveries create interest (and alarm) amongst the religious madrasahs of the city, many of whom also go along with the new fashion of building and testing scientific apparatuses. But most of all, they catch the eye of the Khan's powerful advisor, who sees in their inventions the possibility of great military technology, to fight the rising Chinese threat to the East.|$|E
5|$|This {{concept of}} the double burden with married couples is a {{worldwide}} phenomenon. Throughout different cultures of the world, women spend more total hours in work than men do. In Japan, once married, they are still expected to be devoted wives and mothers who give all off their effort to the home, even after {{a full day of}} work. Latin American women, now entering the work force in large numbers, still face what they call doble jornada, or double day's journey. Although in the Latin American culture, men are starting to interact more with the children and helping around the house more, the main domestic responsibilities still fall upon the women of the house. Sometimes women who are primary wage earners are still relegated to most of the domestic work. European men are more likely to play and interact with their children but not likely to participate fully in their daily care. They are more likely to help their wives at home, yet rarely do they tackle all domestic task equally. Men commonly fail to live up to their <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> equal sharing of domestic labor: they may believe in an equal workload in the house, but the inconvenience of taking on work done by their wives stops many from following through.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} {{pronounced}} effects of Hellenization {{can be seen in}} Afghanistan and India, in the region of the relatively late-rising Greco-Bactrian Kingdom (250–125 BC) (in modern Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Tajikistan) and the Indo-Greek Kingdom (180 BC – 10 CE) in modern Afghanistan and India. There on the newly formed Silk Road Greek culture apparently hybridized with Indian, and especially Buddhist culture. The resulting syncretism known as Greco-Buddhism heavily influenced the development of Buddhism and created a culture of Greco-Buddhist art. These Greco-Buddhist kingdoms sent some of the first Buddhist missionaries to China, Sri Lanka, and the Mediterranean (Greco-Buddhist monasticism). Some of the first and most influential figurative portrayals of the Buddha appeared at this time, perhaps modeled on Greek statues of Apollo in the Greco-Buddhist style. Several Buddhist traditions may have been influenced by the ancient Greek religion: the concept of Boddhisatvas is reminiscent of Greek divine heroes, and some Mahayana ceremonial practices (burning incense, gifts of flowers, and food placed on altars) are similar to those practiced by the ancient Greeks; however, similar practices were also observed amongst the native Indic culture. One Greek king, Menander I, probably became Buddhist, and was immortalized in Buddhist literature as 'Milinda'. The process of Hellenization also spurred trade between the east and west. For example, Greek astronomical instruments dating to the 3rd century BC were found in the Greco-Bactrian city of Ai Khanoum in modern-day Afghanistan, while the Greek concept of a spherical earth surrounded by the spheres of planets eventually supplanted the long-standing Indian cosmological <b>belief</b> <b>of</b> a disc consisting of four continents grouped around a central mountain (Mount Meru) like the petals of a flower. The Yavanajataka (lit. Greek astronomical treatise) and Paulisa Siddhanta texts depict the influence of Greek astronomical ideas on Indian astronomy.|$|E
