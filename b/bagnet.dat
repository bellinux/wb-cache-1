25|$|The {{adaptation}} {{is eight}} hours in length, and covers {{most of the}} characters and storylines in the novel. Characters from the book who are not present include the wife of Snagsby, the law stationer; the wife and grandson of the money lender Smallweed; the law clerk Tony Jobling; the bankrupt Jellyby; Sir Leicester Dedlock's several cousins; and the <b>Bagnet</b> family, friends of the ex-soldier Sergeant George. The character of Clamb, clerk to the lawyer Tulkinghorn, {{was created by the}} screenwriter as a device for showing Tulkinghorn's motives and deeds without recourse to a narrator.|$|E
25|$|Most of the storylines {{are portrayed}} {{substantially}} {{as they are}} in the novel, but somewhat abbreviated. The exceptions to this are in large part consequent to the aforementioned cull of minor characters. The plot mechanics around the possession of Lady Dedlock's letters, which involve Tony Jobling and Smallweed Junior in the novel, are considerably altered, as are the mechanics of the reconciliation between George and his mother, which is brought about by Mrs. <b>Bagnet</b> in the book. The storyline concerning Mrs. Snagsby's paranoid jealousy of her husband is omitted altogether.|$|E

40|$|Fishes of {{the family}} Leiognathidae, popularly called silverbellies, ponyfishes, {{slipmouths}} and toothponies are small to medium sized fishes living at the bottom in shallow coastal waters. They are widely distributed in the Indo-Pacific region. These fishes are captured in several types of fishing gear including bottom trawls, shore seines, gillnets, <b>bagnets</b> etc. Some species occur in dense schools offering great potentialities for commercial exploitation, especially along the coasts of India and Sri Lanka. A few species enter brackishwaters and estuaries. Being small and scanty of flesh, they are consumed very little in fresh condition but mostly sun dried or salt cured. As such they are {{an important source of}} food and fish meal...|$|R

40|$|The Philippines {{is home to}} a mixed of blessings: an {{enormous}} marine biodiversity, a tremendous variety of fishery enterprises, and about 50 million coastal residents who mostly fish and eat fish. So many animals and so many nets in the water result in huge total catches of target fishery species, but also unfortunately of â€˜trash fishâ€™ â€” huge numbers of diverse marine larvae, juveniles, small adults, and unwanted species. 'Trash fish' is a category of fisheries bycatch, which as a whole has been estimated to average about 20 % worldwide, but difficult to quantify in Philippine fisheries given the large number and variety of fishers, fishing grounds, gears, species, and markets. Moreover, it is difficult to quantify {{the costs and benefits of}} a given fishery, and in particular to balance the economic benefits to the coastal communities in terms of food and livelihood versus the ecological costs of catching (killing!) untold numbers of larvae, juveniles, and small adults of innumerable species. Qualitative information is readily available, however, and this article takes as example the case of the filter net or tangab fishery in Iloilo Strait in central Philippines. A typical tangab catch from Iloilo strait is a large mixture of small sizes of low-value and non-marketable species loaded from <b>bagnets</b> into many wooden boxes...|$|R
5000|$|Most {{people here}} are self-sufficient. Fishing and other marine {{products}} are {{the major source of}} income, fish drying and other curing of sea denizens follows second. Beach fronts and foreshores are mostly converted to fish drier/Fish Flake or curing rows/hand flake (Tagalog:). Mangrove-made barn houses called boat shed (Tagalog:) were mostly found near the shore use for smoked fish curing and a type of fishmeal processing called fish hydrolysate(Tagalog:). It also became a major business of some natives. Fish meal processing of bycatch contributes extra income to fishermen, where it is sold by heaps or kilograms to fish meal processor(Tagalog:) [...] Mid areas of barangay are now reclaimed but coastal edges are constantly shrink by frequent typhoons that visit the region. Declined in catches and the profitability of trawling during the 50s spawned other type of fishing activity - the [...] "Basnig" [...] or <b>Bagnets.</b> During the period 1959-63 “Basnigan” made most number of fishing landings here and had made Ragay Gulf the “Basnig fishing ground” of nearby provinces like Camarines Sur, Sorsogon and Cavite. The advent of two-strokes engine trawlers and Dredge Fishing (i.e. Kuto-kuto, Galadgad and Norway(trawlers) make way to new fishing system during the 80s. Crabs and shrimps fishing (i.e. Bubo, Sakag and Mangingilaw) minimal activity are declining but still use today. Late 90s, Republic Act No.8550, Section 90,The Philippine Fisheries Code of 1998 mandated the ban of active fishing gears in municipal water, it brought downsides to sea dependent cultures of Manlayo. Descendants of old fishing multitude strive to work overseas while some struggle to cities like Lucena and Manila.|$|R
40|$|Thailand is {{currently}} {{one of the}} ten largest fishing nations in the world. In 1996, fish production reached 3. 7 million t with 90 % of the production coming from the marine fisheries sector and 10 % from inland fisheries. Thai fishing operates in four fishing grounds namely, the Gulf of Thailand, the Andaman Sea, the South China Sea and the Bay of Bengal. However {{with the establishment of}} the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in 1977, Thailand lost over 300 000 km 2 of traditional fishing grounds. Gross domestic product (GDP) of Thailand was estimated at 4 598 billion Baht (US$ 181 billion at 1 US$ = 25. 36 Baht) in 1996 with 87. 8 billion Baht (US$ 3. 46 billion) (1. 9 %) coming from the fish industry. In 1997, fishery product exports reached 138 624 million Baht (US$ 4 million at 1 US$ = 31. 18 Baht) or 69 % (200 795 million Baht including fish) of the total agriculture exports and 7. 3 % (1 898 276 million Baht) of total exports. However, the rapid growth of manufacturing and service sectors has diminished the contribution of the fisheries sector to GDP in the recent years. Of the estimated 35. 6 million labor force in Thailand in 1998, 43 % were employed in the agricultural sector including fisheries. The 1995 Census of Marine Fishery showed that the total number of fishery households including fisheries employeesÃ† households in the country was 109 635. No census was conducted for inland fisheries. The fisheries sector also supports a substantial level of employment in industries like fish processing, cold storage, fishmeal, ice making, boat construction and the like. The labor force of these industries was estimated to be at 211 682 in 1995. Fish is the primary source of animal protein for most of ThailandÃ†s population, particularly in the coastal and near-coastal provinces. The average per capita fish consumption is 24 kg annually. Marine capture fisheries can be broadly divided into commercial and small scale sub-sectors. Commercial vessels are those vessels over 10 m in length or 5 GT, that use modern fishing gear and have the capacity to fish offshore for several days. Small scale vessels are usually less than 10 m in length and either employ outboard- or inboard-engines, or are non-motorized and operate in near shore areas. From 1985 to 1995, the number of small scale fishing boats increased by 7. 5 %, while the commercial boats increased by 11 %. One reason for the change has been the creation of a boat-tenure system within the commercial fishing sector, resulting in a {{decrease in the number of}} boats per household. The major fishing gear used by the small scale fishers are gillnets, small push nets, lift nets or other modern small scale gear, set traps, <b>bagnets</b> and other stationary gear in estuaries or protected inshore waters. In the fishing household of Songhkla Province, Southern Thailand, shrimp gillnets, cuttlefish trammel nets, Indo-Pacific mackerel gillnets, other gillnets and Acetes trawl nets are the major fishing gear. The fishers direct their effort towards high value species like shrimp, cuttlefish, pomfret fish and crabs, but they also obtain by-catch low value fish species. The most important determinant of profit for small scale fisheries is the interaction between types of gear and fishing ground. Commercial fishing vessels utilize otter trawls, pair trawls, beam trawls, push nets, purse seines and king mackerel gillnets as the major fishing gear. The analysis of investment, cost, revenue and return on demersal and pelagic fishing operations shows that (a) returns differ markedly among size of fishing boats and types of fishing gear; (b) ability to generate profit is greater in large fishing boats than small due to their higher ability to adjust to both economic (investment) and biological (fishing ground) changes; and (c) among the trawlers, medium and large boats can best adapt to maintain continuous profit, while for push nets, all size of boats show declining net profit. In pelagic fishing operations, purse seiners have been developed to make high profits and yield a higher return than trawlers and gillnet fishing operations. The Schaefer Model was applied to estimate the maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and maximum economic yield (MEY) for demersal fish and trash fish in the Gulf of Thailand. Results indicated that the present catch and the corresponding effort of demersal fishing in the Gulf of Thailand surpassed both MEY and MSY. In order to obtain the maximum net benefit in the long run, the present fishing effort of catching demersal fish must be reduced to about 50 % of present levels. This would lead to the rehabilitation of marine resources and minimize the by-catch.
