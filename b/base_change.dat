We have found that the nifH promoter can be weakly activated by the ntrC product; this activation shows the same down response to <b>base</b> <b>changes</b> seen with ntrC activation of the nifL promoter.

The other (malTp 7) is located in the Shine and Dalgarno sequence, which precedes the malT cistron. It probably created a more favourable ribosome binding site on malT mRNA. A correlate of these observations is that the promoter and the ribosome binding site are both inefficient in a wild-type malT gene.

The accuracy of change detection solely depends on the image registration accuracy yet image misalignment is still a major challenge in change detection analysis. In change detection analysis, if change detection is performed on misaligned images, problems such as false changes and missed changes may occur which strongly affect the actual change detection accuracy. Object <b>based</b> <b>change</b> detection has been reported as one the best way to reduce the influence of effects of image misalignment. This is because of its capability to deal with misregistration errors that result into false change and missed changes. In this paper, a tiled object <b>based</b> <b>change</b> detection technique is proposed to reduce the influence of image misalignment on the tile pixel <b>based</b> <b>change</b> detection.
