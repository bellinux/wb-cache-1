The real part of dielectric permittivity was assessed from the 380 – 440 MHz, while the <b>bulk</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> was calculated from the 165 – 325 MHz range. The FDR technique allows determination of <b>bulk</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> from the imaginary part of the complex dielectric permittivity, without disregarding the dielectric losses. The soil salinity status was determined using the salinity index, defined as a partial derivative of the soil <b>bulk</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> with respect to the real part of the soil complex dielectric permittivity. The salinity index method enables determining the soil water electrical conductivity value. For the five sandy mineral soils that have been tested, the relationship between <b>bulk</b> electrical <b>conductivity</b> and the real part of dielectric permittivity is essentially linear.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the {{bulk electrical conductivity}} and microbial population distribution in sediments at a site contaminated with light nonaqueous-phase liquid (LNAPL). The <b>bulk</b> <b>conductivity</b> was measured using in-situ vertical resistivity probes; the most probable num ber method was used to characterize the spatial distri bution of aerobic heterotrophic and oil-degrading mi crobial populations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess if high conductivity observed at aged LNAPL-impacted sites may be related to microbial degradation of LNAPL. The results show higher bulk conductiv ity coincident with LNAPL-impacted zones, in contrast to geoelectrical models that predict lower conductivity in such zones. The highest <b>bulk</b> <b>conductivity</b> was ob served to be associated with zones impacted by resid ual and free LNAPL. Data from bacteria enumeration from sediments close to the resistivity probes show that oil-degrading microbes make up a larger percentage (5 – 55 %) of the heterotrophic microbial community at depths coincident with the higher conductivity compared to � 5 % at the uncontaminated location. The coincidence of a higher percentage of oil-degrading microbial popu lations in zones of higher <b>bulk</b> <b>conductivity</b> suggests that the higher conductivity in these zones may result from increased fluid conductivity related to microbial degra dation of LNAPL, consistent with geochemical studies that suggest that intrinsic biodegradation is occurring at the site.
