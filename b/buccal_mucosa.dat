5|$|This is {{the most}} common type of aphthous stomatitis, {{accounting}} for about 80–85% of all cases. This subtype is termed minor aphthous ulceration (MiAU), or minor recurrent aphthous stomatitis (MiRAS). The lesions themselves may be referred to as minor aphthae or minor aphthous ulcers. These lesions are generally less than 10mm in diameter (usually about 2–3mm), and affect non-keratinized mucosal surfaces (i.e. the labial and <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa,</b> lateral borders of the tongue and the floor of the mouth). Usually several ulcers appear at the same time, but single ulcers are possible. Healing usually takes seven to ten days and leaves no scar. Between episodes of ulceration, there is usually an ulcer-free period of variable length.|$|E
5|$|Other tumors {{can include}} trichodiscomas (tumors {{of the hair}} disc, which may be {{identical}} to fibrofolliculomas), angiofibromas, and perifollicular fibromas. However, angiofibromas are more common in tuberous sclerosis. Along with the tumors, other skin conditions are seen in people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome. Approximately 40% of people or families with the disease have papules in their mouth, which can be located on the cheeks (<b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa),</b> tongue, gums, or lips. Either white or mucosa-colored, they are discrete, small, and soft and consist of fibrous tissue covered in thickened epithelium. Collagenomas of the skin are also found in some families. Many people with BHD have skin lesions {{that appear to be}} acrochordons (skin tags), but may instead be fibrofolliculomas. These lesions are usually found in the armpit, on the eyelids, and in folds of skin. Not all individuals develop the facial tumors; some families with the mutation that causes BHD develop only kidney tumors or spontaneous pneumothorax.|$|E
25|$|There is a diffuse, gray-white, milky {{opalescent}} {{appearance of}} the mucosa which usually occurs bilaterally on the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa.</b> Less often, the labial mucosa, the palate or the floor of mouth may be affected. The surface of the area is folded, creating a wrinkled, white streaked lesion. Apart from the appearance, the lesion is entirely asymptomatic.|$|E

40|$|The transbuccal {{delivery}} of drugs could assist several categories of chronic, especially elderly, patients in adhering to a correct dosage regimen. In particular, patients suffering from dementia have several difficulties in following the prescribed dosage, {{in addition to}} problems associated with swallowing tablets. Galantamine is currently used for treating patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's-type dementia. The transbuccal {{delivery of}} this drug could be an interesting non- invasive and safe administration route. Several studies have been performed in vitro and ex vivo {{within the framework of}} a European Commission funded Project (IntelliDrug-FP 6), aimed at developing a device which would be fitted for controlled delivery of drugs by an electronic and software-driven system. The primary objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the efficacy of a prototype of the IntelliDrug device in vivo on 6 pigs, following a single Galantamine dose to be delivered through the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosae,</b> as compared to intravenous drug injection. The secondary objectives were: a) to verify Galantamine bioavailability through buccal delivery; b) to evaluate the permeation enhancement effect of iontophoresis; and, finally, c) to assess any histomorphological changes in the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosae</b> after transbuccal delivery. The results suggested that transbuccal delivery has the potential to cause long-lasting and controlled blood levels of Galantamine. The latter crosses the entire <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosae,</b> reaching systemic circulation after about 30 minutes and its plasmatic peak approximately 120 minutes after administration. The histological analysis of the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosae</b> did not reveal any evidence of flogosis or tissue injury. Our results have clearly confirmed that the buccal delivery of Galantamine is a reliable tool with which to overcome the drawbacks associated with the conventional administration route. In general, transbuccal drug delivery has been shown to be an interesting, non-invasive and safe administration route for delivering systemically-acting drug...|$|R

25|$|There are no {{symptoms}} {{associated with the}} lesion itself, although many and varied symptoms and signs {{may be associated with}} the underlying cause of immunosuppression. The lesion is a white patch, which almost exclusively occurs on the lateral surfaces of the tongue, although rarely it may occur on the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa,</b> soft palate, pharynx or esophagus. The lesion may grow to involve the dorsal surface of the tongue. The texture is vertically corrugated ("hairy") or thickly furrowed and shaggy in appearance.|$|E
25|$|Thermal burns usually {{result from}} placing hot food or {{beverages}} in the mouth. This may occur {{in those who}} eat or drink before a local anesthetic has worn off. The normal painful sensation is absent and a burn may occur. Microwave ovens sometimes produce food which is cold externally and very hot internally, and {{this has led to}} a rise in the frequency of intra-oral thermal burns. Thermal food burns are usually on the palate or posterior <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa,</b> and appear as zones of erythema and ulceration with necrotic epithelium peripherally. Electrical burns more commonly affect the oral commissure (corner of the mouth). The lesions are usually initially painless, charred and yellow with little bleeding. Swelling then develops and by the fourth day following the burn the area becomes necrotic and the epithelium sloughs off.|$|E
25|$|Actiq is {{produced}} by the pharmaceutical company Cephalon on a plastic stick; this provides {{the means by which}} the drug can maintain its placement while it dissolves slowly in the mouth for absorption across the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa,</b> {{in a manner similar to}} sublingual buprenorphine/naloxone film strips. An Actiq lozenge contains two grams of sugar (eight calories). Actiq has been linked to dental decay, with some users who had no prior dental issues suffering tooth loss, and in the U.S many users have started their own Facebook pages to educate users about the severe dental issues caused by the so-called fentanyl lollipops. CBS News reported the issue 28 September 2009. The status of a sugar-free version, called Actiq-SF, is unclear. Since the release of Fentora—an effervescent buccal fentanyl tablet for breakthrough cancer pain—Cephalon has indefinitely postponed plans to release a sugar-free version of Actiq.|$|E

40|$|Abstract ! The buccal {{mucosal route}} offers several {{advantages}} but {{the delivery of}} certain drugs can be limited by low membrane permeability. This study investigated the buccal permeability properties of didanosine (ddI) and assessed the potential of Aloe vera gel (AVgel) as a novel buccal permeation enhancer. Permeation studies were performed using Franz diffusion cells, and the drug was quantified by UV spectroscopy. Histomorphological evaluations were undertaken using light and transmission electron microscopy. The permeability of ddI was concentration-dependent, {{and it did not}} have any adverse effects on the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosae.</b> A linear relationship (R 2 = 0. 9557) between the concentrations and flux indicated passive diffusion as the mechanism of drug transport. AVgel at concentrations of 0. 25 to 2 %w/v enhanced ddI permeability with enhancement ratios from 5. 09 (0. 25 %w/v) to 11. 78 (2 %w/v) but decreased permeability at 4 and 6 %w/v. Ultrastructural analysis of the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosae</b> treated with phosphate buffer saline pH 7. 4 (PBS), ddI/ PBS, and ddI/PBS/AVgel 0. 5 %w/v showed cells with normal plasmalemma, well-developed cristae, and nuclei with regular nuclear envelopes. However, cells from 1, 2, and 6 %w/v AVgel-treated mucosae showed irregular nuclear outlines, increased intercellular spacing, and plasmalemma crenulations. This study demonstrates the potential of AVgel as a buccal permeation enhancer for ddI to improve anti-HIV and AIDS therapy...|$|R
25|$|One way of {{administering}} resveratrol {{in humans}} may be buccal delivery, that is without swallowing, by direct absorption through tissues {{on the inside}} of the mouth. When one milligram of resveratrol in 50 ml 50% alcohol/ water solution was retained in the mouth for one minute before swallowing, 37nbsp&ng/ml of free resveratrol was measured in plasma two minutes later. This level of unchanged resveratrol in blood can only be achieved with 250nbsp&mg of resveratrol taken in a pill form. However, the viability of a buccal delivery method is called into question due to the low aqueous solubility of the molecule. For a drug to be absorbed transmucosally it must be in free-form or dissolved. Resveratrol fits the criteria for oral transmucosal dosing, except for this caveat. The low aqueous solubility greatly limits the amount that can be absorbed through the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa.</b> Resveratrol that is attempted to be taken buccally was expected to pass through the mucous membrane of the mouth and be absorbed as an oral dose, however, the need to explore buccal delivery in future pharmaceutical formulations was expressed.|$|E
2500|$|Leukoedema (also spelled leucoedema) is a blue, grey {{or white}} {{appearance}} of mucosae, particularly the <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa</b> (the {{inside of the}} cheeks); it may also occur on the mucosa of the larynx or vagina. It is a harmless and very common condition. Because it is so common, {{it has been argued}} that it may in fact represent a variation of the normal appearance rather than a disease, but empirical evidence suggests that leukoedema is an acquired condition caused by local irritation. It is found more commonly in black skinned people and tobacco users. The term is derived from the Greek words λευκός leukós, [...] "white" [...] and οἴδημα oídēma, [...] "swelling".|$|E
2500|$|Many {{surgical}} procedures {{have been developed}} to create a neovagina, as none of them is ideal. [...] Surgical intervention should be considered only after non-surgical pressure dilation methods have failed to produce a satisfactory result. [...] Neovaginoplasty can be performed using skin grafts, a segment of bowel, ileum, peritoneum, , <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa,</b> amnion, or dura mater. [...] Success of such methods should be determined by sexual function, and not by vaginal length alone, as has been done in the past. [...] Ileal or cecal segments may be problematic because of a shorter mesentery, which may produce tension on the neovagina, leading to stenosis. [...] The sigmoid neovagina is thought to be self-lubricating, without the excess mucus production associated with segments of small bowel. [...] Vaginoplasty may create scarring at the introitus (the vaginal opening), requiring additional surgery to correct. [...] Vaginal dilators are required postoperatively to prevent vaginal stenosis from scarring. [...] Other complications include bladder and bowel injuries. [...] Yearly exams are required, as neovaginoplasty carries a risk of carcinoma, although carcinoma of the neovagina is uncommon. [...] Neither neovaginoplasty nor vaginal dilation should be performed before puberty.|$|E

40|$|The titres of {{rabies virus}} in the saliva of kudu {{are higher than}} those of the salivary glands.

2500|$|Although {{symptoms}} {{can vary}} greatly between affected individuals, even those {{within the same}} family, symptoms normally begin in infancy and are typically a result of thickening skin and mucous membranes. [...] The first symptom is often a weak cry or a hoarse voice due to a thickening of the vocal cords. [...] The hoarse voice {{can be one of}} the most striking clinical manifestations of the disease. Lesions and scars also appear on the skin, usually the face and the distal parts of the limbs. This is often the result of poor wound healing and the scarring continues to increase as the patient ages, leaving the skin with a waxy appearance. [...] Skin may be easily damaged as a result of only a minor trauma or injury, leaving many blisters and additional scars. The skin is also usually very dry and wrinkly. [...] White or yellow infiltrates form on the lips, <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosa,</b> tonsils, uvula, epiglottis and frenulum of the tongue. This can lead to upper respiratory tract infection and sometimes requires tracheostomy to relieve the symptom. Too much thickening of the frenulum can restrict tongue movement and may result in speech impediments. Beading of the papules around the eyelids is a very common symptom and is often used as part of a diagnosis of the disease. [...] Some other dermatological symptoms that are sometimes seen but less common include hair loss, parotitis and other dental abnormalities, corneal ulceration, and focal degeneration of the macula.|$|E

5000|$|It is {{characterized}} by a coating or individual patches of pseudomembranous white slough that can be easily wiped away to reveal erythematous (reddened), and sometimes minimally bleeding, mucosa beneath. These areas of pseudomembrane are sometimes described as [...] "curdled milk", or [...] "cottage cheese". The white material is made up of debris, fibrin, and desquamated epithelium that has been invaded by yeast cells and hyphae that invade to the depth of the stratum spinosum. Due to the fact that an erythematous surface is revealed beneath the pseudomembranes, some consider pseudomembranous candidiasis and erythematous candidiasis stages of the same entity. Some sources state that if there is bleeding when the pseudomembrane is removed, then the mucosa has likely been affected by an underlying process such as lichen planus or chemotherapy. Pseudomembraneous candidiasis can involve any part of the mouth, but usually it appears on the tongue, <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosae</b> or palate.|$|R

A total of 24 men underwent urethroplasties for strictures averaging 7. 7  cm (range, 5 – 17  cm) in length, using FTSGs from the inner arm, inner thigh, or abdominal skin. Each of these cases had at least one failed urethroplasty. Twenty-four patients underwent surgery for 26 urethral strictures, with a mean follow-up period of 23. 2 (5 – 44) months and a mean operation time of 140 (115 – 180) minutes.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} “in vivo” the oral microcirculatory characteristics in patients with oral lichen planus (OLP) and to discover any differences in microcirculation in comparison with healthy patients. Study design. Twenty patients with established diagnosis of OLP and 20 healthy patients were examined in our laboratory by means of contact optical probe videocapillaroscopy. The examined areas for each patient were the right and the left <b>buccal</b> <b>mucosae.</b> Capillary density and total capillary diameter, as well as afferent and efferent loop diameter were studied; the discovery of characteristic (tortuous, branched) loops was also investigated. Results. The results were observed by 2 different researchers using the capillaroscope’s software. Capillary density and the diameter of the afferent and efferent ansa were found to be significantly increased in OLP patients compared with controls. There was also a significant difference between the study of capillary tortuousity and the discovery of characteristic branched loops, indicating angiogenesis. Conclusions. Our methodology allowed an in vivo observation of the angiogenesis. Angiogenesis was interpreted as an increase in capillary density, total vascular caliber, and afferent and efferent loop caliber; the discovery of tortuous, branched loops, indicating the angiogenic phenomenon in vivo, was particularly significant.
