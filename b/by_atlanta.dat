The National Cycling Centre includes a velodrome, BMX Arena and Mountainbike trials and {{is the home of}} British Cycling, UCI ProTeam Team Sky and Sky Track Cycling.

5|$|Wiggins {{was moved}} to second base in 1984. That move made room for rookie Carmelo Martínez in the outfield. Until that season, Martínez had been a first baseman, but the Padres already had a strong player there with Garvey, {{and they wanted to}} get Martínez's bat into the lineup to improve their outfield's home run production. Wiggins {{retained}} the leadoff spot in the lineup, hitting ahead of Tony Gwynn. During a May game, Wiggins became the fifth 20th-century MLB player to steal five bases in one game, tying an NL record. In an August game, Wiggins unwittingly became a party to a series of fights. Wiggins was hit with the first pitch of the game <b>by</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Braves pitcher Pascual Pérez. The teams retaliated against each other throughout the game with brushback pitches and beanballs. The tension resulted in three fights and several ejections.|$|E

25|$|None of the Tournament's top seeds {{advanced}} to the Final Four, {{the first time since}} 1980 that this occurred. For the second time in history, a team seeded 11th {{advanced to}} the Final Four as George Mason of the Colonial Athletic Association won the Washington, D.C. region. They were joined <b>by</b> <b>Atlanta</b> region winner LSU (who was the first team to advance to the Final Four as an 11-seed in 1986), Oakland region winner UCLA, who had not made the Final Four since they won the National Championship in 1995, and Minneapolis region winner Florida, who had not made the Final Four since their runner-up finish in 2000 also in Indianapolis.|$|E
25|$|Early in {{the fourth}} quarter, Atlanta trailed 17–6. Facing 3rd & 8 at their own 19-yard line, an unusual play occurred. Matt Ryan {{completed}} a 20-yard pass to Roddy White. White fumbled, and it was recovered by Sabby Piscitelli of the Buccaneers. Piscitelli then ran 3 yards and attempted a lateral to Cato June. The lateral was actually an illegal forward pass, and fell incomplete to the ground. Thought to be a live ball, it was recovered once more <b>by</b> <b>Atlanta,</b> meanwhile a flag for a personal foul by Tampa Bay was also on the field. After several minutes of confusion and discussion by the officials, they awarded the ball to Atlanta at the Tampa Bay 48-yard line. Atlanta continued the drive and managed a field goal, trimming the lead to 17–9.|$|E

500|$|The Atlanta Falcons {{also had}} a [...] "frustrating" [...] team history, as {{described}} <b>by</b> <b>Atlanta</b> sports journalist Terence Moore. Moore singled out the 1980 divisional playoff game against the Dallas Cowboys, in which the Falcons gave up a 14-point lead {{en route to a}} defeat, as well as a 6-turnover performance during their 1991 divisional playoff defeat against the Washington Redskins as notable examples of frustration. Prior to the 1998 season, the Falcons had never played in a Super Bowl. Dan Weiner, an Atlanta Falcons fan writing for Bleacher Report, noted that [...] "For most of the franchise's history, Atlanta was the whipping boy of the 49ers in the old, and geographically , NFC West." ...|$|E
500|$|ATL is a 2006 American comedy-drama film, and {{the feature}} film {{director}}ial debut of music video director Chris Robinson.

The film is a coming-of-age tale concerning Rashad, played <b>by</b> <b>Atlanta</b> native and hip hop artist T.I. in his film debut, and his friends in their final year in high school and on the verge of adulthood. The film also stars Antwan Andre Patton, aka Big Boi of the hip hop group OutKast, Evan Ross, Jackie Long, Lauren London, and Mykelti Williamson.|$|E
500|$|Tolliver {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} worth about $1 million with the Shreveport Pirates of the Canadian Football League [...] before the 1995 season began. Early in the season, Tolliver got to compete against former teammate David Archer in the San Antonio Texans' CFL debut. He finished the season having thrown for 3,767 yards, 16 touchdowns, and 15 interceptions. After the team folded following a 5–13 season, Tolliver was again without a team. In October 1996, Tolliver rejoined the Falcons as the third-string quarterback, this time sitting behind Bobby Hebert and Browning Nagle. He spent the 1996 season on the bench, and did not take a snap in a game. He was re-signed <b>by</b> <b>Atlanta</b> in April and given a one-year contract worth $325,000.|$|E

500|$|Keyes {{was also}} {{especially}} critical of Pat Buchanan, once saying {{during an interview}} on the Talk from the Heart program with Al Kresta (simulcast on KJSL St. Louis and WMUZ Detroit) that Buchanan had a [...] "black heart." [...] Keyes's entry into the Republican race after Buchanan had secured victories in New Hampshire and Louisiana led many to believe that Keyes was a stalking horse for neoconservative elements in the Republican Party, since Buchanan had been a well-known ardent foe of abortion and had suffered political fallout for bringing abortion and [...] "cultural war" [...] {{to the center of}} the public policy debate. [...] Later during the primaries, Keyes was briefly detained <b>by</b> <b>Atlanta</b> police when he tried to force his way into a debate to which he had been invited, and then uninvited.

During an interview with Rolling Stone, Kanye West himself recalled that it was [...] "a very serious moment." [...] When asked for his opinion, Jay-Z replied that he considered [...] "Big Brother" [...] a fair portrayal from a little brother's perspective. Jay-Z {{went on to say that}} he also thought that the song was [...] "brilliantly written" [...] and believed that it was West's best song since [...] "Jesus Walks" [...] as far as structure and emotion.|$|E
500|$|In the 1975–76 NBA {{season the}} Rockets finally had a {{permanent}} home in Houston as they moved into The Summit, which they would call home for the next 29 years. During the period, the franchise was owned by [...] Kenneth Schnitzer, developer of the Greenway Plaza which included The Summit. After missing the 1976 playoffs, Tom Nissalke {{was hired as a}} coach, and pressed the team to add a play-making guard in college standout John Lucas and a rebounding center through Moses Malone, who he had coached in the ABA. The additions had an immediate impact, with the 1976–77 Rockets winning the Central Division and going {{all the way to the}} Eastern Conference Finals, losing to the Julius Erving's Philadelphia 76ers 4 games to 2. The following season had the team regressing to just 28wins due to an injury to captain Tomjanovich, who got numerous facial fractures after being punched by [...] Kermit Washington of the Los Angeles Lakers and wound up spending five months in rehabilitation. After trading Lucas to the Golden State Warriors in exchange for Rick Barry, the Rockets returned to the playoffs in 1978–79, with [...] "The Chairman Of The Boards" [...] Moses Malone receiving the 1979 MVP Award, but the team was swept 2–0 <b>by</b> <b>Atlanta</b> in the first round. Nissalke was let go, and assistant Del Harris was promoted to head coach.|$|E
