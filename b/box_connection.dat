50|$|Bass {{effects are}} {{electronic}} effects units {{that are designed}} for use with the low pitches created by an electric bass or for an upright bass used with a bass amp or PA system. Two examples of bass effects are fuzz bass and bass chorus. Some bass amplifiers have built-in effects, such as overdrive or chorus. Upright bassists in jazz, folk, blues and similar genres may use a bass preamplifier, a small electronic device that matches the impedance between the piezoelectric pickup and the amp or PA system. Bass preamps also allow for the gain of the signal to be boosted or cut. Some models also offer equalization controls, a compressor, and a DI <b>box</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E
50|$|Upright bassists in jazz, folk, {{blues and}} similar genres {{typically}} use a piezoelectric pickup, which {{is mounted on}} the wooden bridge or between the bridge and the body. The pickup is then plugged into a bass amp or the PA system. Before the signal is plugged into a bass amp or PA system, many players use a bass preamplifier, a small electronic device that matches the impedance between the pickup and the amp or PA system. Bass preamps also allow for the gain of the signal to be boosted or cut. Some models also offer equalization controls, a compressor, and a DI <b>box</b> <b>connection,</b> which allows the signal to be plugged directly into a PA system or mixing board with an XLR cable.|$|E

The effective yield of future FPGA architectures considering configurable logic blocks, switch <b>boxes,</b> <b>connection</b> <b>boxes</b> and routing segments is estimated in this paper. The results show that some degree of redundancy for logic blocks, routing and switch boxes is necessary. However, no more than one spare logic block per cluster, and at most one spare wire is required to obtain a satisfactory effective yield. The results also indicate that it is beneficial to increase logic cluster size of future FPGA architectures for better yield. 1...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{signs and}} signals are often {{supported}} by flexible cantilevered structures that are susceptible to wind-induced vibration and fatigue. The latest version of the design specifications published by the American Association of State Transportation Officials (AASHTO) now considers fatigue as a limit state. However, most of the fatigue classifications for welded details were not based on full-scale testing, and {{are thought to be}} overly conservative. This research will address the fatigue resistance of two common mast arm-to-pole connections used in the state of Minnesota. The resistance attained experimentally aligned with current predictions using AASHTO procedures, except for in-plane loading of <b>box</b> <b>connection</b> details. As a consequence of specimen design, a variety of tube-to-transverse plate connections were also tested using multi-sided tube cross-sections with different tube diameters, tube thicknesses, as well as base plate thicknesses. The standard tube-to-transverse plate connection exhibited Category K 2 resistance, two categories lower than the E specified by AASHTO. This resistance was enhanced to Category E through impact treatment or Category E by doubling the base plate thickness. Gusset plates could not prevent cracking of the tube at the base plate, but the tips of the gusset plate exhibited Category E resistance. Minnesota Department of Transportatio...|$|E

40|$|We are {{currently}} exploring {{and developing a}} new statistical mechanics approach to designing self organizing and self assembling systems that is unique to SNL. The primary application target for this ongoing research {{is the development of}} new kinds of nanoscale components and hardware systems. However, a surprising out of the <b>box</b> <b>connection</b> to software development is emerging from this effort. With some amount of modification, the collective behavior physics ideas for enabling simple hardware components to self organize may also provide design methods for a new class of software modules. Large numbers of these relatively small software components, if designed correctly, would be able to self assemble into a variety of much larger and more complex software systems. This self organization process would be steered to yield desired sets of system properties. If successful, this would provide a radical (disruptive technology) path to developing complex, high reliability software unlike any known today. The special work needed to evaluate this high risk, high payoff opportunity does not fit well into existing SNL funding categories, as it is well outside of the mainstreams of both conventional software development practices and the nanoscience research area that spawned it. We proposed a small LDRD effort aimed at appropriately generalizing these collective behavior physics concepts and testing their feasibility for achieving the self organization of large software systems.

40|$|In {{this study}} we created a new routing fabric for {{reducing}} power and delay. The power consumed in a FPGA core consists of both static and dynamic components. Static power contributes only 10 % of the total power consumed in a FPGA. On the other hand, dynamic power contributes over 90 % of the total power consumed {{and it is the}} main source for their power inefficiency. By reducing net length and/or programming overhead the power consumption reduced. Routed net length reduced by using short intersects segments in the routing channels. By decreasing the switch <b>box</b> and/or <b>connection</b> <b>box</b> flexibilities programming overhead reduced. In this study,we concentrated on achieving 1. 80 times lower consumption of dynamic power and 1. 50 times less significant average net delays by re-architecting the programmable routing fabrics such that both routed net lengths and programming overhead reduced without adversely affecting delay...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we present the Collaborative Routing Architecture (CRA), a routing {{architecture}} specially designed to achieve high efficiency in hardware and competitive delay performance for a FPGA. This {{is done by}} enabling routing resource sharing between different types: (1) Long interconnects can be constructed with short bypass interconnects without sacrificing delay performance. (2) Switch <b>boxes</b> and <b>connection</b> <b>boxes</b> both are embedded in the switching core of the routing modules. Therefore routing resources such as MUXs can be shared between them on a per-mapping basis. (3) The switching core in CRA can dynamically extend its switching capability, whereas in a conventional switch box, switch matrix is predetermined and therefore static. These architectural features demonstrate significant performance improvements. Using the same logic placement, the CRA yields about 25 % reduction in the minimum routing channel width, 20 % improvement in overall delay performance for 20 largest MCNC benchmark circuits, when compared with a virtex-II style baseline FPGA.
