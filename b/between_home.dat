5|$|AFL teams won {{the next}} two Super Bowls, and in 1970, the two leagues merged {{to form a new}} 26-team league. The {{resulting}} newly expanded NFL eventually incorporated some of the innovations that led to the AFL's success, such as including names on player's jerseys, official scoreboard clocks, national television contracts (the addition of Monday Night Football gave the NFL broadcast rights on all of the Big Three television networks), and sharing of gate and broadcasting revenues <b>between</b> <b>home</b> and visiting teams.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is {{referred}} to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the infield; the area farther beyond the infield is the outfield. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height (many amateur games are played on unfenced fields). The fair territory <b>between</b> <b>home</b> plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.|$|E
5|$|According to Dekema, {{planning}} for I-805 began in 1956. The original routing for I-805 was approved as an Interstate Highway in July1958. It {{was added to}} the state highway system and the Freeway and Expressway System in 1959 as Route241. I-805 was expected to reduce traffic on what was then US101 between Los Angeles and San Diego, when the former was opened. Route241 was renumbered to Route805 in the 1964 state highway renumbering, and I-5 was designated along the route from Los Angeles to San Diego. Further planning was underway in 1965, with the goal to have the route built by 1972, the federal highway funding deadline. This was to be the first freeway in the area with no prior road along its route that it would replace; the goal was to provide a bypass around San Diego for those traveling to Mexico, and improve access for local residents. By June, houses along the route in the North Park area were being sold, as the land was needed for the first stretch of the freeway to be constructed. The next year, Dekema confirmed that the first portion of what was known as the Inland Freeway to be built would be <b>between</b> <b>Home</b> and Adams avenues.|$|E

25|$|Because cities rely on {{specialization}} and {{an economic}} {{system based on}} wage labour, their inhabitants must {{have the ability to}} regularly travel <b>between</b> <b>home,</b> work, commerce, and entertainment. Citydwellers travel foot or by wheel on roads and walkways, or use special rapid transit systems based on underground, overground, and elevated rail. Cities also rely on long-distance transportation (truck, rail, and airplane) for economic connections with other cities and rural areas.|$|E

Prime Minister David Cameron intervened {{to resolve the}} row, insisting that May sack her Special Advisor Fiona Cunningham (now Hill) for releasing on May's website a confidential letter to May's colleagues, and that Michael Gove, the Education Secretary, apologise to the Home Office's head of Security and Counter-Terrorism, Charles Farr, for uncomplimentary briefings of him appearing {{on the front page}} of The Times.|$|E
25|$|Circular {{migration}} or repeat {{migration is}} the temporary and usually repetitive movement of a migrant worker <b>between</b> <b>home</b> and host areas, typically {{for the purpose}} of employment. It represents an established pattern of population mobility, whether cross-country or rural-urban. There are several benefits associated with this migration pattern, including gains in financial capital, human capital, and social capital. There also costs associated with circular migration, such as brain drain, poor working conditions, forced labor, and the inability to transfer acquired skills to home economies. Socially, there are strong connections to gender, health outcomes, development, poverty, and global immigration policy.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} agreement <b>between</b> <b>Home</b> Oil and British Gas was a 15-year contract {{valued at}} £27million for {{the delivery of}} 75 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) (2.1 million m3/d) of gas with a maximum flow of 100 MMSCFD (2.8 million m3/d). By 1974 aquifer water ingress into the gas reservoir had significantly reduced gas production to about 1 MMSCFD (28,300 m3/d). The production and gas treatment facility was permanently shutdown in October 1974. Over three years it had produced 11.3 billion standard cubic feet of gas (320 million standard m3), only 4.5% of the estimated recoverable reserves.|$|E
25|$|In the Reich, {{sports are}} the sole {{province}} of the Aryans and are controlled by the German Federation of Sport — which favors German sportsmen over sportsmen from other states. It {{has the power to}} reserve the right to withdraw from competition with foreign teams; and to withhold the rights of foreign teams to tour the Reich when political relations sour. An example is boycotting Italian sports teams after a riot at a football match in Milan <b>between</b> <b>home</b> team fans and the visiting Leipzig team fans. Deprivation of the right to tour the Reich, and of having Reich teams visit, is financially hurtful. Germany won a recent World Cup but now is challenged by a powerful, multi-racial Brazil comprising Negroes and Native Americans, and others.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary {{income is}} a net income concept, {{meaning that it}} will be {{deduction}} for costs incurred to acquire income. There is therefore a deduction for expenses related to acquisition of income if these are higher than the basic allowance. There is also several other deductions from ordinary income; special allowance for disability, special tax allowance for pensioners, the tax limitation rule for the disabled, seamen’s allowance, fishermen’s allowance, special allowance for self-employed within agriculture, special allowance for high expenses linked to illness, allowance for payments to individual pension schemes, allowance for travel <b>between</b> <b>home</b> and work, allowance for donations to voluntary organisations, allowance for paid union fees, allowance for home investment savings scheme for people under 34 years, parental allowance for documented expenses for childminding and childcare, etc.|$|E

25|$|While the Snows {{were settled}} back in America, Ed would {{continue}} to travel back and forth <b>between</b> <b>home</b> and Europe. His books and reporting on China had earned him critical acclaim in the U.S. This success made Ed a very valuable asset as a war correspondent. President Roosevelt often looked to Ed for his understanding on matters in Asia. Roosevelt personally suggested Ed become a war correspondent once again, to which Ed agreed. Though {{he did not want}} to report on World War II directly after his time in China, his personal struggles with Helen and encouragement from Roosevelt pushed Ed to travel and cover the war. In 1945, the couple legally separated. Ed started a new relationship with actress Lois Wheeler and sought a divorce from Helen. The divorce proceedings took several years as the two were stalemated in terms of settlement. The couple formally divorced in 1949. Ed married Lois less than ten days after the official date of the divorce. He lived in exile in Switzerland until he died from cancer in 1972.|$|E
500|$|By March 1970, the {{original}} section <b>between</b> <b>Home</b> Avenue and near I-8 was almost finished. The Mission Valley portion extending north of US395, {{as well as}} from Otay Valley Road and J Street in Chula Vista, were still under construction. The portion immediately north of US395 was contracted to A.A. Baxter Corporation, E.C. Young, and Young and Sons, Inc. for $7.9million (equivalent to $ in [...] ). On July 6, the first section to begin construction was dedicated, and was to be opened from El Cajon Boulevard to Wabash Boulevard soon thereafter; the rest of the section would not open until the Mission Valley interchange with I-8 was finished.|$|E

500|$|In March 1858, the National Association of Base Ball Players (NABBP) {{was formed}} at another convention. Adams {{was one of}} the Knickerbockers' two delegates, having been {{selected}} at a February meeting attended by representatives from 25 clubs. He held the chairmanship of the association's rules and regulations committee, and drafted the new organization's initial set of rules. These included a clarification of the prescribed distance between bases, which under Knickerbocker Rules had been set at [...] "forty-two paces" [...] <b>between</b> <b>home</b> plate and second base, and [...] "forty-two paces, equidistant" [...] between first and third base. Historians differ on whether the bases were roughly [...] apart, or a shorter distance. Thorn has written that the pace itself may have been [...] "an imprecise and variable measure, to gauge distances by 'stepping off'," [...] and Adams described the rule as [...] "rather vague." [...] At the 1857 convention, it was decided that bases would be [...] "securely fastened upon the four corners of a square whose sides are roughly thirty yards." [...] As rules committee chairman for the new NABBP, Adams made the baselines [...] from one base to another, the distance seen in modern baseball. He ruled on the distance <b>between</b> <b>home</b> plate and the pitcher's mound as well, making them [...] apart. In addition, the committee mandated that clubs have nine players per side, which became the norm. It also created the called strike rule, in an effort to reduce pitch totals and the time required to play games.|$|E
500|$|Plans {{to replace}} Anfield were {{originally}} initiated by Liverpool F.C. in May 2002.

Several attempts were made between 2003 and 2007 by the Liverpool City Council to instigate a groundshare of the proposed stadium with local rivals Everton, but this move was rejected, as neither club favoured it. On 30 July 2004 Liverpool was granted planning permission {{to build a new}} stadium [...] away from Anfield at Stanley Park. On 8 September 2006 Liverpool City Council agreed to grant Liverpool F.C. a 999-year lease of the land on the proposed site.|$|E
500|$|In September 1970, bidding began for {{the final}} portion of the {{northern}} half of I-805 between Miramar Road and I-5; a month later, the segments <b>between</b> <b>Home</b> Avenue and SR94, and SR54 to 12th Street had funding allocated. By {{the end of the}} year, Hazard, Maxwell, and Matich had submitted the low bid of around $7.2million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for the northernmost portion. The Chula Vista portion of the freeway from Main Street to LStreet was completed in February 1971; by then, the estimated date for completing the entire freeway had slipped to 1975 from 1972. By March, the projected completion date for the Mission Valley bridge was revised to July 1972. A 102-home mobile home park was approved by the City Council a few weeks later to house those who were displaced by the freeway construction.|$|E

500|$|... apply 2-satisfiability to {{a problem}} of sports scheduling, in which the pairings of a {{round-robin}} tournament have already been chosen and the games must be assigned to the teams' stadiums. In this problem, it is desirable to alternate home and away games to the extent possible, avoiding [...] "breaks" [...] in which a team plays two home {{games in a row}} or two away games in a row. At most two teams can avoid breaks entirely, alternating <b>between</b> <b>home</b> and away games; no other team can have the same home-away schedule as these two, because then it would be unable to play the team with which it had the same schedule. Therefore, an optimal schedule has two breakless teams and a single break for every other team. Once one of the breakless teams is chosen, one can set up a 2-satisfiability problem in which each variable represents the home-away assignment for a single team in a single game, and the constraints enforce the properties that any two teams have a consistent assignment for their games, that each team have at most one break before and at most one break after the game with the breakless team, and that no team has two breaks. Therefore, testing whether a schedule admits a solution with the optimal number of breaks can be done by solving a linear number of 2-satisfiability problems, one for each choice of the breakless team. A similar technique also allows finding schedules in which every team has a single break, and maximizing rather than minimizing the number of breaks (to reduce the total mileage traveled by the teams).|$|E
