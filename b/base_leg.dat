25|$|On June 18, 1993, upon {{approach}} for landing on Grass Runway 22, a Glasflügel H-101 glider registered N101AZ, encountered a powered airplane, which {{had entered the}} landing pattern. The pilot extended his <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> to the approach to accommodate the aircraft. He then decided {{that it would be}} difficult to complete the landing on the planned runway, so he switched to a site he was unfamiliar with. During this landing, the glider impacted a ditch. The ultra-light aircraft suffered damage to its tail section.|$|E

5000|$|These {{approaches}} {{include both}} ground-based and satellite-based systems and include criteria for terminal areas (TAAs), basic approach criteria, and final approach criteria. The TAA is {{a transition from}} the en route structure to the terminal environment which provides minimum altitudes for obstacle clearance. The TAA is a [...] "T" [...] or [...] "basic T" [...] design with left and right <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> IAFs on initial approach segments perpendicular to the intermediate approach segment {{where there is a}} dual purpose IF/IAF for a straight-in procedure (no procedure turn NoPT), or hold-in-lieu-of procedure-turn (HILO) course reversal. The <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> IAFs is 3 to 6 NM from the IF/IAF. The basic-T is aligned with the runway centerline, with the IF 5 NM from the FAF, and the FAF is 5 NM from the threshold.|$|E
5000|$|In Canada, {{aircraft}} at uncontrolled airports usually {{cross the}} airport at midfield at pattern altitude from the upwind side, turning onto the downwind leg. Although joining straight in downwind {{is also a}} possibility.

The American (also called [...] "contemporary") Burmese is a noticeably stockier cat, with a much broader head, round eyes and distinctively shorter, flattened muzzle; the ears are wider at the <b>base.</b> <b>Legs</b> and tail should be proportionate to the body, medium-length, and the paws also rounded.|$|R

50|$|At high altitudes, {{there is}} plenty of space for recovery. But during the final approach, when the {{airplane}} is close to the ground, a stall-spin accident is often fatal. A common cause of this accident is to enter a skidding turn in the airfield traffic pattern on the turn from <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> to final approach, unconsciously using excessive rudder in an attempt to tighten the turn and avoid overshooting the runway centreline.|$|E
5000|$|In a {{standard}} airport landing pattern, {{which is usually}} used under visual meteorological conditions (VMC), aircraft turn from <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> to final within one-half to two miles of the airport.

40|$|Robots {{can help}} to {{demonstrate}} and prove concepts on human locomotion such as concepts <b>based</b> on springlike <b>leg</b> behavior. Hopping is a fundamental requirement for run-ning in two basic functions: bouncing and balancing. In addition, for robust hopping against perturbations, swing-ing the leg in flight/swing phase is observed. These three elements need to be integrated for stable/robust locomotion in bipeds. Unlike running [1] and walking [2], stable hop-ping cannot be achieved with a fixed angle of attack {{with respect to the}} ground. So, finding an appropriate leg direc-tion during the flight phase is needed for stable hopping in place. In this study, different methods of leg adjustment dur-ing swing phase are compared both in simulation with SLIP (Spring Loaded Inverted Pendulum) model and in human experiment. Because of the lack of space and since we re-ported the simulation results previously [3], in this paper, it is just reported with a few sentences. Our presented method called VBLA (Velocity <b>Based</b> <b>Leg</b> Adjustment) shows better performance in modeling and is also closer to what humans do. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Based on the {{importance}} of the robot for the elderly and the disabled, a quadruped walking robot using 3 -RPS parallel mechanism as the basic leg mechanism is proposed. The structure of the basic leg is described, and the whole structure of the quadruped walking robot is formed. Then taking the workspace of the basic leg as the standard, the optimum size parameters of the upper platform and the lower platform of the <b>based</b> <b>leg</b> are achieved. Meanwhile the workspace of the basic leg is obtained by the anti-solution search method. Taking the basic leg as analysis object and applying the virtual organization method, the kinematic expression is got. All of these analyses lay a theoretical foundation for the further study on the quadruped walking robot with parallel leg mechanism...|$|R

50|$|At 19:57, Funchal {{cleared the}} crew to descend to 3500 ft and {{informed}} them that the QNH was 1014.0 mb. Apparently, during the landing checklist, the crew forgot to set the altimeter to that value, and proceeded to the final 180° turn to the downwind leg well below the correct altitude, losing sight of the runway lights. Relying only on instruments, the pilot descended below the 720 ft required during circling and reached the <b>base</b> <b>leg</b> below 200 ft, impacting the sea soon after that. At the time of impact, the altimeter was reading 500 ft. The aircraft had its landing gear down and the flaps were extended at 20 degrees.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} perform {{efficient}} and robust locomotion is crucial condition for real-world legged robots. Unlike running and walking [1], stable hopping cannot be achieved with a fixed angle of attack with respect to ground. Also, the region of attraction for stable running is quite small with fixed angle of attack. This drawback and sensitivity to running velocity and control parameters exist in common leg adjustment methods. In this study, {{the superiority of the}} new method regarding aforementioned concerns is shown for running and hopping SLIP model. Its similarity to human hopping strategy to cope with perturbation was shown in [2]. The presented method, called VBLA (Velocity <b>Based</b> <b>Leg</b> Adjustment) can achieve dead beat response for perturbed hopping.
