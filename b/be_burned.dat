5|$|After {{ordering}} {{almost all}} civilians {{to leave the}} city in September, Sherman gave instructions that all military and government buildings in Atlanta <b>be</b> <b>burned,</b> although many private homes and shops were burned as well. This was to set a precedent for future behavior by his armies.|$|E
5|$|Charged {{with the}} crime of heresy, based on her claim of visions and signs from God, she is tried in an ecclesiastical court proceeding, which is forced by the English {{occupation}} government. The English wish to quickly condemn and execute Joan since English soldiers are afraid to fight while she remains alive, based on their belief that she could supernaturally affect battles even while in prison. Bishop Cauchon expresses his fear of wrongfully executing someone who might have received visions from God. About to <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> for heresy, Joan is distraught {{that she will be}} executed without making a final confession. The Bishop tells her she must recant her visions before he can hear her confession. Joan signs the recantation. The relieved Bishop shows the paper to the English, saying that Joan can no longer <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> as a heretic. Whilst in her cell, Joan is confronted by an unnamed cloaked man (Dustin Hoffman), who is implied to be Joan's conscience. The man makes Joan question whether she was actually receiving messages from God.|$|E

5|$|George V disliked {{sitting for}} {{portrait}}s and despised modern art; {{he was so}} displeased by one portrait by Charles Sims that he ordered it to <b>be</b> <b>burned.</b> He did admire sculptor Bertram Mackennal, who created statues of George for display in Madras and Delhi, and William Reid Dick, whose statue of George V stands outside Westminster Abbey, London.|$|E
5|$|In massive stars, heavier {{elements}} {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> in a contracting core through the neon-burning process and oxygen-burning process. The final {{stage in the}} stellar nucleosynthesis process is the silicon-burning process that results {{in the production of}} the stable isotope iron-56, an endothermic process that consumes energy, and so further energy can only be produced through gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|NEERC is {{expected}} to be capable of handling up to 190,000 tonnes of waste per year. This waste will <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> to generate electricity for the National Grid and cogenerate to provide heat for local industries in the form of steam. NEERC will have two processing lines, capable of generating 21MW of electricity, enough to provide for 37,500 homes. This means that over the two facilities, 640,000 tonnes of waste will <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> annually, and over 50MW of electricity generated. This would make Teesside the largest operational EfW centre in the UK outside London. The plant will be a mirror image of the current one, and will create 160 jobs; 25 in South Tyne and Wear, 100 {{in the construction of the}} plant, and the rest once the plant is operational.|$|E

5|$|Tongue {{piercing}} was {{practiced by}} the Aztec, Olmec and Mayan cultures as a ritual symbol.

5|$|Bowie perished {{with the}} rest of the Alamo {{defenders}} on March 6, when the Mexicans attacked. Most of the noncombatants in the fort, including Bowie's relatives, survived. Santa Anna ordered the alcalde of San Antonio, Francisco Antonio Ruiz, to confirm the identities of Bowie, Travis, and Crockett. After first ordering that Bowie be buried, as he was too brave a man to <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> like a dog, Santa Anna later had Bowie's body placed with those of the other Texians on the funeral pyre.|$|E

5|$|Chinautla Viejo was {{attacked}} by the invading Spanish in 1525; the first two attacks against the heavily fortified city were unsuccessful. The besieged city received Poqomam reinforcements that were comprehensively defeated on an open field of battle, with the Spanish cavalry being decisive. The capture of Poqomam prisoners allowed the Spanish to discover {{the location of a}} cave providing a secret entrance to the city. A third assault broke the month-long siege, allowing the Spanish to take the city. The surviving inhabitants were moved to another settlement and Pedro de Alvarado ordered the city to <b>be</b> <b>burned.</b>|$|E

5|$|Heating {{oil shale}} to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature causes the chemical process of pyrolysis {{to yield a}} vapor. Upon cooling the vapor, the liquid shale oil—an unconventional oil—is separated from combustible oil-shale gas (the term shale gas can also refer to gas occurring naturally in shales). Oil shale can also <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> directly in furnaces as a low-grade fuel for power generation and district heating or used as a raw material in chemical and construction-materials processing.|$|E

In 2005, Nelson and several other business partners formed Willie Nelson Biodiesel ("Bio-Willie"), a company that is marketing bio-diesel bio-fuel to truck stops.

5|$|In 2008, it was {{announced}} SITA had plans to build another EfW plant adjacent to the current one, named the North East Energy Recovery Centre (NEERC). SITA UK began consulting key partners, stakeholders and local residents on these plans in April 2008, before submitting a formal planning application that summer. Permission for the plant's construction was granted on 15 October 2008. On 17 September 2010, it {{was announced}} that SITA had signed a contract with the South Tyne and Wear Waste Management Partnership for their waste to <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> at NEERC once the plant was completed. Construction is expected to begin in early 2011, in time for a 2013 completion date.|$|E
5|$|On 9 January 1942, the 718th Infantry Division issued {{orders to}} both its regiments that defined the {{following}} groups as hostile: all non-residents and residents {{that had been}} absent from their localities until recently; all identifiable Chetniks or communists with or without weapons or ammunition; and anyone concealing, supplying or providing information to those groups. Any captured Partisans were to be briefly interrogated and summarily shot, as were any other insurgents that had attacked the Germans, been caught carrying ammunition or messages, or who resisted or fled. Also, any houses from which shots were fired at German troops were to <b>be</b> <b>burned.</b>|$|E
5000|$|This {{allows the}} {{emergency}} medical provider {{to obtain a}} quick estimate of how much body surface area <b>is</b> <b>burned.</b> For example, if a patient's entire back (18%) and entire left leg (18%) <b>are</b> <b>burned,</b> about 36% of the patient's BSA is affected. The BSAs assigned to each body part refer to the entire body part. [...] So, for example, if half of a patient's left leg <b>were</b> <b>burned,</b> it would <b>be</b> assigned a BSA value of 9% (half the total surface area of the leg). Thus, if a patient's entire back (18%), but only half of their left leg (9%) <b>was</b> <b>burned,</b> the amount of BSA affected would be 27%.|$|R

Mulder heads inside the boxcar, finding a pile of the dead creatures, each with smallpox vaccination scars on their arms. The Smoking Man arrives by helicopter with eight armed commandos and, not finding Mulder inside, orders the boxcar to <b>be</b> <b>burned.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Tripurarahasya, a south Indian Shakta text, retells the story, {{giving more}} {{importance}} to the Goddess. When Shiva wishes to see Vishnu's Mohini form again, Vishnu fears that he may <b>be</b> <b>burned</b> to ashes like Kamadeva by the ascetic Shiva. So, Vishnu prays to goddess Tripura, who grants half of her beauty to Vishnu, begetting the Mohini-form. As Shiva touches Mohini, his seed spills, indicating a loss of the merit gained through of all his austerities.|$|E
5|$|The {{frustrated}} English devise {{another way}} to have Joan executed by the church. English soldiers go into Joan's cell room, rip her clothes and give her men's clothing to wear.
