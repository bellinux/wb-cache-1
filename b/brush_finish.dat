50|$|Commonly brushed metals include {{stainless}} steel, aluminium and nickel. <b>Brushed</b> <b>finishes</b> {{are popular}} in both small appliances and whiteware, and feature in architecture and automotive design. The Gateway Arch and DeLorean DMC-12 are both clad in brushed stainless steel. The {{intensity of the}} <b>brushed</b> <b>finish</b> is specified as a surface roughness and is typically 0.5-1.5 micrometres Ra.|$|R

50|$|A <b>brushed</b> <b>finish</b> is {{susceptible}} to damage. <b>Brushed</b> <b>finishes</b> also typically have a detrimental effect on corrosion resistance. In particular the brushed texture limits the ability of fluid to bead on the material surface. In the case of stainless steel the grooves of the finish can accumulate chloride ions which break down the chromium oxide passivation layer, enabling rusting to occur.|$|R
50|$|Grade 430 {{is popular}} grade, low cost {{alternative}} to series 300's grades. Used when high corrosion resistance {{is not a}} primary criteria. Common grade for appliance products, often with a <b>brushed</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like rays of light, this {{sculpture}} rises boldly {{with strong}} vertical lines that fan upwards and outwards. Water passes {{over the top}} edges and glides down the sculpture’s surfaces. With its <b>brushed</b> <b>finish,</b> “Ray of Light” emits a brilliant shimmering light, magnified by its multiple articulated surfaces.|$|R
50|$|Its density, {{similar to}} that of gold, allows {{tungsten}} to be used in jewelry as an alternative to gold or platinum. Metallic tungsten is hypoallergenic, and is harder than gold alloys (though not as hard as tungsten carbide), making it useful for rings that will resist scratching, especially in designs with a <b>brushed</b> <b>finish.</b>|$|R
40|$|Grinding {{and turning}} {{as well as}} shot peening, work hardening, diamond {{burnishing}} and power <b>brush</b> <b>finishing</b> are changing the microstructure and residual stresses in machined parts. Beside {{the depth of the}} influenced perpheral layer also the surface distribution of microstructure and residual stress have to be measured by rapid scanning nondestructive testing systems. The employed methods should be sensitive to changes in the influenced layers up to about 200 MilliMy and should have a local resolution of about 1 mm. Because microstructure and residual stress states both influence the measured signals, only multiparameter strategies can garantee unambiguous testing results...|$|R
2500|$|For platinum, gold, {{and silver}} jewellery, {{there are many}} {{techniques}} to create finishes. The most common are high-polish, satin/matte, brushed, and hammered. High-polished jewellery {{is the most common}} and gives the metal a highly reflective, shiny look. Satin, or matte finish reduces the shine and reflection of the jewellery, and this is commonly used to accentuate gemstones such as diamonds. <b>Brushed</b> <b>finishes</b> give the jewellery a textured look and are created by brushing a material (similar to sandpaper) against the metal, leaving [...] "brush strokes". Hammered finishes are typically created by using a rounded steel hammer and hammering the jewellery to give it a wavy texture.|$|R

5000|$|The {{stainless}} steel cabinet surrounding of each letter {{is made from}} thin gauge {{stainless steel}} fascia panels with a non-directional <b>brushed</b> <b>finish.</b> These panels provide a [...] "dimple" [...] like protective coating and are attached with a hi-bond adhesive to the frame structure. The frame structure is a 2" [...] x 6" [...] section welded together. The thin gauge painted steel [...] "letterforms" [...] are welded to the monolithic frame. A steel leveling plate was used to mount each letter into a 46” x 18” x ¼” base plate configuration using gussets, vinyl tape, and silicone. The leveling plate {{is attached to a}} concrete footer. [...] Each of the five of the letters are 7.5 feet in height, 3.5 feet in length, with the main steel cabinet having a depth of 5.875 inches. If all five sculptures were placed side by side the length would total 17.5 feet.|$|R
25|$|Like marimbas, {{professional}} vibraphones have bars of graduated width. Lower {{bars are}} made from wider stock, and higher notes from narrower stock, to help balance volume and tone across {{the range of the}} instrument. The bars are anodized, typically in silver or gold color, after fine tuning, and may have a smooth or <b>brushed</b> (matte) <b>finish.</b> These are cosmetic features with a negligible effect on the sound.|$|R

50|$|The {{paintings}} of Pejić are much darker {{and full of}} symbols than his sculptures. Through years, his works became ever more expressive. Colours gradually became purer and more intensive. He centred his work on a fight against the loss of human virtues and the dehumanisation of man. Pejić's paintings were much influenced by his sculpture work. There is no single redundant stroke there. Colors were squeezed directly from tubes and mixed on canvas. He started the images with <b>brushes</b> and <b>finished</b> them with fingers and hands.|$|R
40|$|Machining of {{components}} like grinding, turning, shot peening, work hardening, diamond burnishing and power <b>brush</b> <b>finishing</b> {{as well as}} thermal treatments such as laser-, induction- and case hardening or nitriding change the microstructure and the residual stress state in surface layers up to approximately one millimeter of depth. Nondestructive techniques {{have the ability to}} characterize microstructure and residual stress in these layered structures and because of the numerous rather complex interactions with the material, multiparametrical strategies are applied. Using at least two, in major applications up to eight parameters derived from different micromagnetic quantities like Barkhausen noise, incremental permeability and tangential field strenght, satisfying results have been achieved. Investigations using mechanically machined components as well as those with laserhardened surfaces are performed. The results like the quantitative evaluation of the stress states, of the hardness va lues and of the depth of the hardened layers agree well with the results of x-ray and other conventional tests. In order to meet the requirements of applications under workshop conditions, a portable system (3 MA-PC) has been developed. Handy multiparameter probes are available to meet different geometrical conditions. Data acquisition and evaluation is supported by a PC with Window-surface to facilitate the application...|$|R

50|$|The Onix Audio/Onix Hifi and Onix Amplifiers were {{characterized}} by a minimalistic, simple, slim design, without visible screws on the casings. The amplifiers housed unusually large power supplies and were constructed using high quality components. Onix cases were always made from aluminium. They used a powder coat finish in matt black, and the front was originally in the same finish with a screen print word ONIX. In 1987, Onix changed the finish of most products to a <b>brushed</b> anodized <b>finish,</b> as well as making subtle cosmetic and electronic changes to the overall original design as the years passed.|$|R
