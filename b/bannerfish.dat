2500|$|The Chaetodontidae can be, {{but are not}} usually, {{divided into}} two {{lineages}} that arguably are subfamilies. The subfamily name Chaetodontinae is a little-used leftover from the period when the Pomacanthidae and Chaetodontidae were united under the latter name as a single family. Hence, Chaetodontinae is today considered a junior synonym of Chaetodontidae. In any case, one lineage of Chaetodontidae (in the modern sense) contains the [...] "typical" [...] butterflyfish around Chaetodon, while the other unites the <b>bannerfish</b> and coralfish genera. As the Perciformes are highly paraphyletic, the precise relationships of the Chaetodontidae as a whole are badly resolved.|$|E
2500|$|Butterflyfish are {{group of}} about 120 species {{belonging}} to the family Chaetodontidaeof Perchiformes. They include <b>bannerfish</b> and coralfish. They are widespread on coral reefs. Butterflyfish are mostly between [...] in length. The largest species, the lined butterflyfish and saddle butterflyfish, grow to [...] Many species are brightly coloured and strikingly patterned, though other species are dull in colour. Many have eyespots on their flanks and dark bands across their eyes, not unlike the patterns seen on butterfly wings. Their deep, laterally narrow bodies are easily noticed through the profusion of reef life. The conspicuous colouration of butterflyfish may be intended for interspecies communication. Butterflyfish have uninterrupted dorsal fins with tail fins that may be rounded or truncated, but are never forked. Generally diurnal and frequenting waters of less than [...] (though some species descend to [...] ), butterflyfish stick to particular home ranges. The corallivores are especially territorial, forming mated pairs and staking claim to a specific coral head. Contrastingly, the zooplankton feeders form large conspecific groups. By night butterflyfish hide in reef crevices and exhibit markedly different colouration. Their colouration also makes butterflyfish popular aquarium fish. However, most species feed on coral polyps and sea anemones, which can result in problems for the hobby aquarists.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the origins and}} maintenance of the high diversity of coral reef fishes in the Indo-Australian Archipelago (IAA), the largest marine biodiversity hotspot. Bayesian age estimation techniques, combining molecular and palaeontological data, were used to reconstruct an evolutionary timeline for four conspicuous coral reef fish families: the Labridae (wrasses), Chaetodontidae (butterflyfishes), Pomacentridae (damselfishes) and Apogonidae (cardinalfishes). First, the evolutionary origins of trophic novelty and habitat preference were explored in the Labridae and Chaetodontidae. Then, to assess congruence in patterns of cladogenesis, rates of diversification and lineage accumulation were compared for the four families. Finally, to gain a biogeographic perspective, ancestral range reconstruction {{was used to compare}} global patterns of origination and dispersal. Specifically, the origins and progression of biodiversity in the IAA was compared to other marine provinces. Combined, these data provided an insight into the evolution of this complex association between fishes and coral reefs. A chronogram of the Labridae identified molecular origins in the late Cretaceous, with both major lineages (hypsigenyine and julidine) present shortly after the K/T boundary (63 MY). All major lineages were in place {{by the beginning of the}} Miocene (23 MY) with most diversification in extant lineages occurring within the Miocene. Multiple origins of novel feeding modes were revealed with two distinct pulses. The Palaeocene/Eocene saw the origins of feeding modes that are well represented in other families: gastropod feeders, piscivores and browsing herbivores. A second wave of innovation in the Oligocene/Miocene resulted in more specialised feeding modes: coral feeding, foraminifera feeding and fish cleaning. There is little evidence of a general relationship between trophic specialisation and species diversity. All major feeding modes on present day reefs were probably already in place 7. 5 million years ago. The Chaetodontidae stem lineage has origins in the Eocene and by the early Oligocene the two major lineages have diverged: <b>bannerfishes</b> and butterflyfishes. Optimisation of recent ecological data reveal that corallivory has arisen at least five times over a period of 12 MY, from 15. 7 to 3 MY. Significantly higher diversity was recorded in lineages of the genus Chaetodon, in which the greatest number of corallivores are found. However, it was the move onto coral reefs in the Miocene, not corallivory that foreshadowed rapid cladogenesis within Chaetodon. This coincides with a global reorganisation of coral reefs and the expansion of fast-growing corals. This historical association underpins the sensitivity of specific butterflyfish clades to global coral decline. Previous chronologies of the Labridae and Chaetodontidae were reassessed with increased taxon sampling, and added fossil data. For the first time, the timing of diversification within the Pomacentridae and Apogonidae were estimated using Bayesian inference. Lineage through time plots for these four families revealed a possible late Eocene/early Oligocene cryptic extinction event coinciding with the collapse of the ancestral Tethyan/Arabian hotspot. Rates of diversification analysis revealed elevated cladogenesis in all four families in the Oligocene/Miocene. In this rebound, lineages with a high percentage of coral reef associated taxa display significantly higher diversities and higher net diversification rates than expected, throughout the Miocene epoch. Similar patterns were found in other reef associated fish and gastropod groups. The development of a complex mosaic of reef habitats in the IAA during the Oligocene/Miocene period appears to have been a significant driver of cladogenesis at this time. Patterns of diversification among taxa suggest that coral reefs also acted as a refuge from high extinction, as reef taxa are able to sustain significant diversity at higher extinction rates than their non-reef counterparts. As such, the IAA appears to support both cladogenesis and survival in associated lineages, laying the foundation for the Recent IAA marine biodiversity hotspot. Ancestral range reconstruction of the Chaetodontidae, Pomacentridae and Labridae revealed temporal patterns of origination and dispersal between the East Pacific, Atlantic, Indian Ocean, IAA and Central Pacific. The IAA acts as both a centre of origination and as a source of diversity to the Indian Ocean and Central Pacific, for all three families. The Atlantic and East Pacific both show high relative rates of origination, however, on a global scale these regions support significantly lower origination than the IAA. Inferred palaeodiversity of ancestral lineages is masked by the extinction of lineages following the closure of the Tethys seaway and decline of ancestral biodiversity hotspots. Lineages of Eocene and Oligocene origin that appear restricted to the IAA would have been peripheral at the time to the Tethyan hotspot. However, it was the proliferation and expansion of these restricted lineages throughout the Miocene that underpins the diversity in the IAA hotspot and across the entire Indo-Pacific. The distribution of vicariance events across known historical barriers highlights the lack of temporal congruence among taxa in the Isthmus of Panama, the East Pacific Barrier and the Terminal Tethyan Event, but much greater congruence between the IAA, Indian and Pacific Oceans. In summary, for three of the four families, initial divergences following the K/T boundary represent the origins of generalised feeding strategies. During this time there was the potential for panmixia between all ocean regions. The apparent slowdown in net speciation rate throughout the Eocene may reflect a late Eocene/Oligocene cryptic extinction event. The survival and subsequent proliferation of Eocene lineages restricted to the IAA during the Miocene underpins much of the current biodiversity on coral reefs and laid the foundation for a wave of trophic innovation in the Labridae and Chaetodontidae. In all four families, Recent patterns are a result of evolutionary, geological and ecological factors spanning over 40 to 60 MY. Today's hotspot is the product of long history of division, decline and diversification...|$|R
