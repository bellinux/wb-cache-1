40|$|We {{adopt an}} individual-differences {{perspective}} and introduce {{a model that}} links types of <b>biases</b> and types of people. We propose that <b>biases</b> are created {{in the course of}} people's attempts to satisfy basic motivations, and that three such motivation categories underlie many of the <b>biases</b> discussed in the literature. Accordingly, our organizing framework integrates findings from previous research and classifies <b>biases</b> into: verification <b>biases,</b> simplification <b>biases,</b> and regulation <b>biases.</b> Individual differences in core self-evaluations, in approach/avoidance temperament, and in cognitive ability and style help explain how <b>biases</b> come about and why some {{people are more likely to}} exhibit particular <b>biases...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{perceived}} {{direction of}} a motion step (probe stimulus) can be influenced by an earlier motion step or a brief motion sweep containing {{a series of steps}} (<b>biasing</b> stimulus). Depending upon experimental conditions, the <b>biasing</b> of the direction of the probe step (a phase shift of 180 °±Φ) by a <b>biasing</b> stimulus which precedes it by approximately 250 ms can either increase (positive filter <b>biasing)</b> or decrease (negative filter <b>biasing)</b> the tendency to see the probe move in the <b>biasing</b> direction as computed with a motion filter with a biphasic temporal impulse response. In a series of experiments it was found that <b>biasing</b> motions traversing 90 ° of phase angle in fewer than six steps in less than 100 ms produced positive filter <b>biasing.</b> Also, <b>biasing</b> of the probe direction could be dissociated from the consciously reported direction of the <b>biasing</b> stimulus, and it did not occur when the probe preceded rather than followed the <b>biasing</b> stimulus. A <b>biasing</b> sweep containing more than six steps traversing 90 ° or a sweep traversing 270 ° produced negative filter <b>biasing.</b> Perceptual fusion of the steps of the sweep was not a necessary condition for obtaining negative filter <b>biasing.</b> In general, the negative filter <b>biasing</b> effects were found to be the most pervasive for the conditions investigated, and they are suggestive of a direction-specific, adaptation-like (gain-control) process in first-order motion filters. The exception to the negative <b>biasing</b> rule was found only with <b>biasing</b> stimuli which were short in duration or distance spanned...|$|R
40|$|<b>Biased</b> agonism {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing topics in G protein-coupled {{receptor}} pharmacology; moreover, <b>biased</b> agonists are used in the clinic today: carvedilol (Coreg®) is a <b>biased</b> agonist of beta-adrenergic receptors. However, there is a general lack of understanding of <b>biased</b> agonism when compared to traditional pharmacological terminology. Therefore, this review is designed to provide a basic introduction to classical pharmacology as well as G protein-coupled receptor signal transduction in order to clearly explain <b>biased</b> agonism for the non-scientist clinician and pharmacist. Special emphasis is placed on <b>biased</b> agonists of the beta-adrenergic receptors, as these drugs are highly prescribed, and a hypothetical scenario based on current clinical practices and proposed mechanisms for treating disease is discussed in order to demonstrate the need for a more thorough understanding of <b>biased</b> agonism in clinical settings. Since <b>biased</b> agonism provides a novel mechanism for treating disease, greater emphasis is being placed to develop <b>biased</b> agonists; therefore, it is important for <b>biased</b> agonism to be understood in equal measure of traditional pharmacological concepts. This review, along with many others, can be used to teach the basic concepts of <b>biased</b> agonism, and this review also serves to introduce the subsequent reviews that examine, in more depth, the relevance of <b>biased</b> agonism towards the angiotensin type 1 receptor, parathyroid hormone receptor, and natural <b>biased</b> ligands towards chemokine receptors...|$|R

5|$|Most known Albertosaurus {{individuals}} were aged 14 {{years or more}} {{at the time of}} death. Juvenile animals are rarely found as fossils for several reasons, mainly preservation <b>bias,</b> where the smaller bones of younger animals {{were less likely to be}} preserved by fossilization than the larger bones of adults, and collection <b>bias,</b> where smaller fossils are less likely to be noticed by collectors in the field. Young Albertosaurus are relatively large for juvenile animals, but their remains are still rare in the fossil record compared with adults. It has been suggested that this phenomenon is a consequence of life history, rather than <b>bias,</b> and that fossils of juvenile Albertosaurus are rare because they simply did not die as often as adults did.|$|E

5|$|Mutation <b>bias</b> {{effects are}} {{superimposed}} on other processes. If selection would favor either {{one out of}} two mutations, {{but there is no}} extra advantage to having both, then the mutation that occurs the most frequently is the one that is most likely to become fixed in a population. Mutations leading to the loss of function of a gene are much more common than mutations that produce a new, fully functional gene. Most loss of function mutations are selected against. But when selection is weak, mutation <b>bias</b> towards loss of function can affect evolution. For example, pigments are no longer useful when animals live in the darkness of caves, and tend to be lost. This kind of loss of function can occur because of mutation <b>bias,</b> and/or because the function had a cost, and once the benefit of the function disappeared, natural selection leads to the loss. Loss of sporulation ability in Bacillus subtilis during laboratory evolution appears to have been caused by mutation <b>bias,</b> rather than natural selection against the cost of maintaining sporulation ability. When there is no selection for loss of function, the speed at which loss evolves depends more on the mutation rate than it does on the effective population size, indicating that it is driven more by mutation <b>bias</b> than by genetic drift. In parasitic organisms, mutation <b>bias</b> leads to selection pressures as seen in Ehrlichia. Mutations are biased towards antigenic variants in outer-membrane proteins.|$|E

40|$|For mobile radar, offset <b>biases</b> and {{attitude}} <b>biases</b> influence radar measurements simultaneously. Attitude <b>biases</b> {{generated from the}} errors of the inertial navigation system (INS) of the platform can be converted into equivalent radar measurement errors by three analytical expressions (range, azimuth, and elevation, resp.). These expressions are unique and embody the dependences between the offset {{and attitude}} <b>biases.</b> The dependences indicate that all the attitude <b>biases</b> {{can be viewed as}} and merged into some kind of offset <b>biases.</b> Based on this, a unified registration model (URM) is proposed which only contains radar “offset biases” in the form of system variables in the registration equations, where, in fact, the “offset biases” contain the influences of the attitude <b>biases.</b> URM has the same form as the registration model of stationary radar network where no attitude <b>biases</b> exist.

40|$|AbstractAn {{enhanced}} sampling method—biased Brownian dynamics—is {{developed for}} the calculation of diffusion-limited biomolecular association reaction rates with high energy or entropy barriers. <b>Biased</b> Brownian dynamics introduces a <b>biasing</b> force {{in addition to the}} electrostatic force between the reactants, and it associates a probability weight with each trajectory. A simulation loses weight when movement is along the <b>biasing</b> force and gains weight when movement is against the <b>biasing</b> force. The sampling of trajectories is then <b>biased,</b> but the sampling is unbiased when the trajectory outcomes are multiplied by their weights. With a suitable choice of the <b>biasing</b> force, more reacted trajectories are sampled. As a consequence, the variance of the estimate is reduced. In our test case, <b>biased</b> Brownian dynamics gives a sevenfold improvement in central processing unit (CPU) time with the choice of a simple centripetal <b>biasing</b> force...|$|R
