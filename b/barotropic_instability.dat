40|$|Abstract The {{main goal}} of this work is to {{appraise}} the finite element method {{in the way it}} represents <b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities.</b> To that end, three different formulations are employed. The free-surface formulation solves the prim-itive shallow-water equations and is of predominant use for ocean modeling. The vorticity–stream function and velocity–pressure formulations resort to the rigid-lid approximation and are presented because theoretical results are based on the same approximation. The growth rates for all three formulations are compared for hyperbolic tangent and piecewise linear shear flows. Structured and unstruc-tured meshes are utilized. The investigation is also extended to time scales that allow for instability meanders to unfold, permitting the formation of eddies. We find that all three finite element formulations accurately represent barotropic instablities. In particular, convergence of growth rates toward theoretical ones is observed in all cases. It is also shown that the use of unstructured meshes allows for decreasing the computational cost while achieving greater accuracy. Overall, we find that the finite element method for free-surface models is effective at representing <b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities</b> when it is combined with an appropriate advection scheme and, most importantly, adapted meshes...|$|R

40|$|International audienceGent and McWilliams have {{identified}} the mechanism of internal <b>barotropic</b> <b>instability</b> for axisymmetric vortices which are purely barotropic, but are immersed in a stratified environment. The energy source is the kinetic energy of the barotropic vortex, which can be converted into baroclinic energy by growing oscillations of finite vertical scale. This occurs when the eddy is too tall and thin. The present paper deals with the generalized instability problem of surface-intensified eddies, presenting a complex vertical structure. We first consider the class of eddies whose horizontal size is either close to (or smaller than) the first radius of deformation. On an f-plane, such eddies are more stable than their purely barotropic counterpart to internal <b>barotropic</b> <b>instability,</b> {{all the more so}} that they are fat. This result, which is fond through the identification of the linearly unstable normal modes, is also confirmed through direct numerical simulations. The β-effect acts asymmetrically with regard to internal <b>barotropic</b> <b>instability</b> between purely barotropic and surface-intensified eddies: it stabilizes purely barotropic vortices, wile it enhances the instability of surface-intensified ones. Nonlinear destabilization of vortices can also occur when they undergo finite-amplitude perturbations, for instance, through their interaction with other structures. The Tourbillon eddy is shown to be weakly unstable to linear <b>barotropic</b> <b>instability,</b> but can be destabilized nonlinearly by finite-amplitude perturbations. Finally, eddies whose horizontal size is at least twice as large as the radius of deformation are shown to be primarily unstable to baroclinic instability...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the flow induced by an east–west-oriented oceanic thermal front {{in a highly}} idealized baroclinic model. Previous work showed that thermal fronts could produce energetic midlatitude jets in an equivalent-barotropic atmosphere and that <b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities</b> of this jet had dominant periods of 25 – 30 and 65 – 75 days. The present study extends this work to a two-mode baroclinic free atmosphere. The baroclinic jet produced {{in this case is}} subject to both <b>barotropic</b> and baroclinic <b>instabilities.</b> A <b>barotropic</b> symmetric <b>instability</b> propagates westward with periods of roughly 30 days and is similar to those found in the equivalent-barotropic model. A baroclinic instability results in standing-dipole anomalies and oscillates with a period of 6 – 8 months. A mixed barotropic–baroclinic instability results in anomalies that propagate northward, perpendicular to the jet, with a period of 2 – 3 months. The later anomalies are reminiscent of the 70 -day oscillation found over the North Atlantic in observed fields. The atmospheric flow has two distinct states: the flow in the high-energy state exhibits two large gyres and a strong eastward jet; its antisymmetric component is dominant. The low-energy flow is characterized by small gyres and a weak jet. The model’s dynamics depends on the layer-depth ratio. When the model is nearly equivalent-barotropic, symmetric oscillatory modes dominate. As the two layers become nearly equal, antisymmetric oscillatory modes become significant and the mean energy of the flow increases. When the oceanic thermal front’s strength T * is weak (T * � 1. 5 °C), the flow is steady. For intermediate values of the strength (1. 5 °C � T * � 3 °C), several oscillatory instabilities set in. As the frontal strength increases further (T * � 3 °C), the flow becomes more turbulent. These results all depend on the atmospheric model’s horizontal resolution being sufficiently high. 1...|$|R

40|$|Current {{climate models}} employ {{horizontal}} grid resolutions of about 1 deg {{in the ocean}} component which do not allow for the explicit representation of mesoscale processes such as eddies. It is likely that this limitation implies an underestimation of the variability of crucial climate quantities (e. g. the global mean temperature) since eddy-resolving ocean models enable specific modes of internal low-frequency variability that are not excited in non-eddy-resolving ocean models. Recently, {{the emergence of the}} so-called Southern Ocean Mode (SOM) in a state-of-the-art global eddy-resolving ocean model was described.

In this study we continue the analysis of the SOM by exploring, for the first time, the time evolution of the mechanical energy cycle (the Lorenz energy cycle, LEC) in a realistic global eddy-resolving ocean model.

Hurricanes, with their low-vorticity cores (the eye of the storm), are naturally occurring examples of such vortices. The instability is for asymmetric perturbations of azimuthal wavenumber-one about the vortex, and grows in amplitude as t 1 / 2 for long times, {{despite the fact that}} there can be no exponentially growing wavenumber-one instabilities in inviscid, two-dimensional vortices. This instability is further studied in three fluid flow models: with high-resolution numerical simulations of two-dimensional flow, for linearized perturbations in an equivalent shallow-water vortex, and in a three-dimensional, baroclinic, hurricane-like vortex simulated with a high-resolution mesoscale numerical model. The instability is found to be robust in all of these physical models. Interestingly, the algebraic instability becomes an exponential instability in the shallow-water vortex, though the structures of the algebraic and exponential modes are nearly identical. In the three-dimensional baroclinic vortex, the instability quickly leads to substantial inner-core vorticity redistribution and mixing. The instability is associated with a displacement of the vortex center (as defined by either minimum pressure or streamfunction) that rotates around the vortex core, and thus offers a physical mechanism for the persistent, small-amplitude trochoidal wobble often observed in hurricane tracks. The instability also indicates that inner-core vorticity mixing will always occur in such vortices, even when the more familiar higher-wavenumber <b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities</b> are not supported. 1...|$|R

For strong and positive forcing only, centrifugal instability sets in. a single disc is used, one of the circulation cells is typically much stronger than the other and the flow is strongly asymmetric in radius.

The preferred spatial scale of the instability is that of the oceanic baroclinic Rossby radius of deformation. It can only be represented in numerical models, when the dynamics at this scale is resolved in the atmosphere and ocean. The dynamics are studied using two superposed shallow water layers: one for the ocean and one for the atmosphere. The interaction is due to the shear between the two layers. The shear applied to the ocean is calculated using the velocity difference between the ocean and the atmosphere and the quadratic drag law. In one-way interaction, the shear applied to the atmosphere neglects the ocean dynamics; it is calculated using the atmospheric wind only. In two-way interaction, it is opposite to the shear applied to the ocean. In one-way interaction, the atmospheric shear leads to a <b>barotropic</b> <b>instability</b> in the ocean.

In a self-contained way, this study introduces it to the atmospheric dynamical diagnostics, with important theoretical updates. Multiscale energy equations are derived using a new analysis apparatus, namely, multiscale window transform, with respect to both the primitive equation and quasi-geostrophic models. A reconstruction of the "atomic" energy fluxes on the multiple scale windows allows for a natural and unique separation of the in-scale transports and cross-scale transfers from the intertwined nonlinear processes. The resulting energy transfers bear a Lie bracket form, reminiscent of the Poisson bracket in Hamiltonian mechanics, we hence would call them "canonical". A canonical transfer process is a mere redistribution of energy among scale windows, without generating or destroying energy as a whole. By classification, a multiscale energetic cycle comprises of available potential energy (APE) transport, kinetic energy (KE) transport, pressure work, buoyancy conversion, work done by external forcing and friction, and the cross-scale canonical transfers of APE and KE which correspond respectively to the baroclinic and <b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> among others, in geophysical fluid dynamics. A buoyancy conversion takes place in an individual window only, bridging the two types of energy namely KE and APE, it does not involve any processes among different scale windows, and is hence basically not related to instabilities.

Modeling of shelf-fjord dynamics was performed with the Bergen Ocean Model. Observations show a rapid and overwhelming intrusion of Atlantic Water across the shelf and into the fjord during midsummer giving rise to intense seasonality.

This geostrophic control mechanism is found to be more important than the hydraulic control common to many fjords. Slow modification of the fjord water during spring reduces the effectiveness of geostrophic control, and by midsummer, Atlantic Water intrudes into the fjord, switching from being Arctic dominant to Atlantic dominant. Atlantic Water continues to intrude throughout the summer and by September reaches some quasi steady state condition.

40|$|A superrotating {{atmosphere}} with equatorial {{winds of}} ∼ 35 m s- 1 is simulated using a simplified Venus general circulation model (GCM). The equatorial superrotation {{in the model}} atmosphere is maintained by <b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the midlatitude jets which transport angular momentum toward the equator. The midlatitude jets are maintained by the mean meridional circulation, and the momentum transporting waves are qualitatively similar to observed midlatitude waves; an equatorial Kelvin wave is also present in the atmosphere. The GCM is forced by linearized cooling and friction parameterizations, with hyperdiffusion and a polar Fourier filter to maintain numerical stability. Atmospheric superrotation is a robust feature of the model and is spontaneously produced without specific tuning. A strong meridional circulation develops {{in the form of}} a single Hadley cell, extending from the equator to the pole in both hemispheres, and from the surface to 50 km altitude. The zonal jets produced by this circulation reach 45 m s- 1 at 60 km, with peak winds of 35 m s- 1 at the equator. A warm pole and cold collar are also found in the GCM, caused by adiabatic warming in the mean meridional circulation. Wave frequencies and zonal wind speeds are smaller than in observations by cloud tracking but are consistent with a Doppler shifting by wind speeds in the generating region of each wave. Magnitudes of polar temperature anomalies are smaller than the observed features, suggesting dynamical processes alone may not be sufficient to maintain the large observed temperature contrasts at the magnitudes and periods found in this GCM.

In the first part, the problem of the vertical structure of tropical waves generated by cumulus heating is treated for the following two cases: 1) heating is controlled by large-scale low-level convergence and 2) heating receives no feedback from large-scale motion. In the first case it is shown that waves which have a short vertical wavelength relative to the vertical scale of heating are stable, and the structure of the most unstable solution is computed [...] .

40|$|Solitary meanders of the Agulhas Current, {{so-called}} Natal pulses, {{may play}} an important role in the overall dynamics of this current system. Several hypotheses concerning the triggering of these pulses are tested using sea surface height and temperature data from satellites. The data show the formation of pulses in the Natal Bight area at irregular intervals ranging from 50 to 240 days. Moving downstream at speeds between 10 and 20 km day− 1 they sometimes reach sizes of up to 300 km. They seem to play a role in the shedding of Agulhas rings that penetrate the South Atlantic. The intermittent formation of these solitary meanders is argued to be most probably related to <b>barotropic</b> <b>instability</b> of the strongly baroclinic Agulhas Current in the Natal Bight. The vorticity structure of the observed basic flow is argued to be stable anywhere along its path. However, a proper perturbation of the jet in the Natal Bight area will allow <b>barotropic</b> <b>instability,</b> because the bottom slope there is considerably less steep than elsewhere along the South African east coast. Using satellite altimetry these perturbations seem to be related to the intermittent presence of offshore anticyclonic anomalies, both upstream and eastward of the Natal Bight...|$|E
40|$|Inertial {{instability}} in a rotating shear flow redistributes absolute linear momentum {{in such a}} way as to neutralize the instability. In the absence of other instabilities, the final equilibrium can be predicted by a simple construction based on conservation of total momentum. Numerical simulations, invariant in the along-stream direction, suppress <b>barotropic</b> <b>instability</b> and allow only inertial instability to develop. Such simulations, at high Reynolds numbers, are used to test the theoretical prediction. Four representative examples are given: a jet, a wall-bounded jet, a mixing layer and a wall-bounded shear layer...|$|E
40|$|Planetary waves with periods {{between two}} and four days in the middle {{atmosphere}} over Antarctica are characterized using one year of data from the medium-frequency spaced antenna (MFSA) radars at Scott Base, Rothera, and Davis. In order to investigate {{the origin of the}} observed waves, the ground-based data are complemented by temperature measurements from the Earth Observing System Microwave Limb Sounder (EOS MLS) instrument on the Aura satellite as well as wind velocity data from the United Kingdom Met. Office (UKMO) stratospheric assimilation. Observed characteristics of waves with a period of approximately two days in summer are consistent with the quasi-two-day wave (QTDW) generally found after the summer solstice at low- and mid-latitudes. The Scott Base observations of the QTDW presented here are the highest-latitude ground-based observations of this wave to date. Waves with preferred periods of two and four days occur in bursts throughout the winter with maximum activity in June, July, and August. The mean of the two- and four-day wave amplitudes is relatively constant, suggesting constant wave forcing. When several waves with different periods occur at the same time, they often have similar phase velocities, supporting suggestions that they are quasi-non-dispersive. In 2005, a “warmpool” lasts from late July to late August. An alternative interpretation of this phenomenon is the presence of a structure propagating with the background wind. Consideration of the role of vertical shear (baroclinic instabilities) and horizontal shear (<b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities)</b> of the zonal wind suggests that instabilities are likely {{to play a role in}} the forcing of the two- and four-day waves, which are near-resonant modes and thus supported by the atmosphere...|$|R
40|$|Oceanic large- and meso-scale flows {{are nearly}} {{balanced}} in forces between Earth’s rotation and density stratification effects (i. e. geostrophic, hydrostatic balance associated with small Rossby and Froude numbers). In this regime advective cross-scale interactions mostly drive energy toward larger scales (i. e. inverse cascade). However, viscous energy dissipation occurs at small scales. So {{how does the}} energy reservoir at larger scales leak toward small-scale dissipation to arrive at climate equilibrium? Here we solve the linear instability problem of a balanced flow in a rotating and continuously stratified fluid far away from any boundaries (i. e. an interior jet). The basic flow is unstable not only to geostrophic baroclinic and <b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities,</b> but also to ageostrophic instabilities, leading {{to the growth of}} small-scale motions that we hypothesize are less constrained by geostrophic cascade behaviours in a nonlinear regime and thus could escape from the inverse energy cascade. This instability is investigated in the parameter regime of moderate Rossby and Froude numbers, below the well-known regimes of gravitational, centrifugal, and Kelvin–Helmholtz instability. The ageostrophic instability modes arise with increasing Rossby number through a near-degeneracy of two unstable modes with coincident phase speeds. The near-degeneracy occurs in the neighbourhood of an identified criterion for the non-integrability of the ‘isentropic balance equations’ (namely A- S= 0 with A the absolute vertical vorticity and S the horizontal strain rate associated with the basic flow), beyond which development of an unbalanced component of the flow is expected. These modes extract energy from the basic state with large vertical Reynolds stress work (unlike geostrophic instabilities) and act locally to modify the basic flow by reducing the isopycnal Ertel potential vorticity gradient near both its zero surface and its critical surface (phase speed equal to basic flow speed) ...|$|R
40|$|The role of short-wave instabilities on geostrophic {{turbulence}} is {{studied in}} a simplified model consisting of three layers in the quasi-geostrophic approximation. The linear stability analysis shows that short-wave instabilities {{are created by}} the interplay between the shear in {{the upper and lower}} layers. If the stratification is non-uniform, in particular surface intensified, the linear growth rate is larger for short-wave instabilities than for long-wave instabilities and the layers are essentially decoupled, with the small scales growing independently. The fully developed homogeneous turbulence is studied in a number of numerical experiments. Results show that in both the case of equal layer depths and surface intensified stratification an inverse cascade in kinetic energy is observed. The modal kinetic energy spectra for the case with surface intensified stratification show higher energy for higher baroclinic numbers at small scales, due to the decoupling of the layers. As a result, while the case with equal layer depths shows large <b>barotropic</b> <b>instabilities</b> with large scale gradients of potential temperature, the surface intensified stratification is characterized by a transition from surface dynamics, characterized by a patchy distribution of vorticity, to interior dynamics, characterized by vorticity filamentation. The effect of the short-wave instabilities {{can be seen in the}} probability distribution functions of the potential vorticity anomaly, which reduces to a Gaussian distribution when the growth rate of the short-wave instabilities is larger than the growth rate for the long-wave instabilities. The surface intensified stratification also alters the vertical structure of the potential vorticity fluxes and shows deviations of the fluxes from a scaling obtained assuming that the turbulence acts as a downgradient diffusion. Experiments with a passive tracer shows a dominance of the coherent structures at large scales, and of filamentation at smaller scales, in the tracer dispersion...|$|R
