5|$|The new Order {{was again}} struck {{down by the}} Divisional Court and Court of Appeal before {{proceeding}} to the House of Lords where it was heard by Lords Hoffmann, Bingham, Rodger, Carswell and Mance between 30 June and 3 July 2008. In their judgment, issued on 22 October 2008, the Lords decided by a 3-2 majority to uphold the new Order in Council, stating that it was valid and, although judicial review actions could look at Orders in Council, the national security and foreign relations issues in the case barred them from doing so. In addition, Cook's statement had not <b>been</b> <b>clear</b> and unambiguous enough to provide legitimate expectation.|$|E
5|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long <b>been</b> <b>clear.</b> In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. As production of TV movies expanded {{with the introduction of}} the ABC Movie of the Week in 1969, soon followed by the dedication of other network slots to original features, time and financial factors shifted the medium progressively into B picture territory. Television films inspired by recent scandals—such as The Ordeal of Patty Hearst, which premiered a month after her release from prison in 1979—harkened {{all the way back to}} the 1920s and such movies as Human Wreckage and When Love Grows Cold, FBO pictures made swiftly in the wake of celebrity misfortunes. Many 1970s TV films—such as The California Kid (1974), starring Martin Sheen—were action-oriented genre pictures of a type familiar from contemporary cinematic B production. Nightmare in Badham County (1976) headed straight into the realm of road-tripping-girls-in-redneck-bondage exploitation.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{contention}} arose {{over what}} kind of institution the Hurva would be. Secularist and nationalist-religious activists opposed the notion of another synagogue in the Old City and wanted the site to become a museum presenting the historical saga of the Jewish Quarter and displaying archaeological finds unearthed there. They viewed the appointment of Kook as the rabbi while the structure was still a shell as a move aimed at preventing a Modern Orthodox rabbi, {{who would have been}} more amenable to a broader utilisation of the site, from getting the position. Rabbi of the Jewish Quarter, Avigdor Nebenzahl, has <b>been</b> <b>clear</b> that he wants the building to serve as a synagogue and a house of study.|$|E

25|$|Alexander VI staked {{the hopes}} of the Borgia family on Cesare's brother Giovanni, who was made captain general of the {{military}} forces of the papacy. Giovanni was assassinated in 1497 in mysterious circumstances. Several contemporaries suggested that Cesare might have been his killer, as Giovanni's disappearance could finally open to him a long-awaited military career and also solve the jealousy over Sancha of Aragon, wife of Cesare's younger brother, Gioffre, and mistress of both Cesare and Giovanni. Cesare's role in the act has never <b>been</b> <b>clear.</b> However, he had no definitive motive, as he {{was likely to be}} given a powerful secular position, whether or not his brother lived. It is more likely that Giovanni was killed {{as a result of a}} sexual liaison.|$|E
25|$|Whereas Archelaus {{was deemed}} incompetent by Augustus and {{replaced}} with a prefect in 6 AD, Antipas would govern Galilee and Perea for forty-two years. These territories were separated by {{the region of the}} Decapolis, with Galilee to the north and Perea to the south (see map). Threats to stability in both areas would have <b>been</b> <b>clear</b> to Antipas when he took office. While he had been making his case to Augustus in Rome, dissidents led by one Judas son of Hezekiah had attacked the palace of Sepphoris in Galilee, seizing money and weapons with which they terrorised the area. In a counterattack ordered by Quinctilius Varus, Roman governor of Syria, Sepphoris was destroyed by fire and its inhabitants sold as slaves. Perea, meanwhile, bordered on the kingdom of Nabatea, which had long had uneasy relations with Romans and Jews.|$|E
25|$|In the 21st century, {{major changes}} to the ice pack due to climate change have stirred {{speculation}} that the passage may become clear enough of ice to permit safe commercial shipping for {{at least part of}} the year. On August 21, 2007, the Northwest Passage became open to ships without the need of an icebreaker. According to Nalan Koc of the Norwegian Polar Institute, this was the first time the Passage has <b>been</b> <b>clear</b> since they began keeping records in 1972. The Northwest Passage opened again on August 25, 2008. However, drifting chunks of ice, especially in springtime, remain problematic as they can clog straits or severely damage a ship's hull. Cargo's routes may therefore be slower and uncertain, depending on conditions. Because most of the containerized traffic operates in a just-in-time mode, which does not tolerate delays well, and the relative isolation of the passage (which impedes shipping companies from optimizing their operations by grouping multiple stopovers on a same itinerary), the NWP and other Arctic routes are not usually seen as promising shipping lanes.|$|E

25|$|On television, the {{parallels}} between the weekly series that became the mainstay of prime-time programming and the Hollywood series films of an earlier day had long <b>been</b> <b>clear.</b> In the 1970s, original feature-length programming increasingly began to echo the B movie as well. While there had been dramatic feature presentations made especially for TV {{since the beginning of}} the medium's mass commercialization in the late 1940s, they had by and large not crossed over with the realm of the B movie. In the 1950s, the live television drama—a unique amalgam of cinematic and theatrical elements exemplified by Playhouse 90 (1956–1961)—had predominated. Over the course of the 1960s, there was a transition to prerecorded features; most of those produced by the major networks either aspired to the prestige of major motion pictures (e.g., CBS's 1965 Cinderella) or were intended as pilots for projected series. During this period, AIP produced a number of low-grade genre pictures such as Zontar, The Thing from Venus (1966) intended for the first-run TV syndication market.|$|E
25|$|According to others, {{the first}} sign of a Soviet–German {{political}} détente was the conversation between Soviet ambassador Aleksey Merekalov and Ernst von Weizsäcker, State Secretary in the German Foreign Ministry, on April 17, 1939, when the former hinted at possible improvement of the relations. This was followed by a series of perceived German signals of goodwill and the replacement of Litvinov with Molotov. According to Geoffrey Roberts, recently released documents from the Soviet diplomatic files show that western historians have been mistaken in assuming that the Merekalov-Weiszäcker meeting of April 1939 was the occasion for Soviet signals of a desire for détente with Nazi Germany. His point of view, supported by Derek Watson and Jonathan Haslam, is that {{it was not until the}} end of July 1939 – August 1939 that the policy change occurred and that it was a consequence rather than a cause of the breakdown of the Anglo-Soviet-French triple alliance negotiations. It must have <b>been</b> <b>clear</b> to Molotov and Stalin in August 1939, that an agreement with Germany avoided an immediate war with that country and could satisfy Soviet territorial ambitions in eastern Poland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, and Bessarabia; whereas an alliance with Britain and France offered no territorial gains and risked a war with Germany in which the USSR was most likely to bear the brunt of a German attack.|$|E
