40|$|Using U. <b>S.</b> {{cross-border}} <b>bank</b> exposure data, {{this study}} establishes {{a line of}} arguments and findings, which together constitute the following observation: "Deregulation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks,</b> via consolidation and a volatile earnings stream, increased volatility in bank lending to emerging economies, and, in due course, worsened the financial crises in emerging economies. " The volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending to emerging economies has increased during the past twenty years. To explain the across-the-board, increasing volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market claims, this study turns to the supply side of the equation: the deregulation in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> sector that imparted this commonality to their banks' investment patterns to emerging economies. In so doing, it unveils the linkages through which U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation ratcheted up the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies. It starts with the detection of a particular feature of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> emerging market lending that warrants further attention [...] increasing volatility over time. Unlike bank lending from Europe or Japan, U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending exhibited the unique feature of increasing volatility over time, regardless of its destination. By looking into domestic push factors that could have contributed to this characteristic, this study identified a temporal association between important deregulation initiatives in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> industry and the volatility of emerging market lending by U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> during the same period. This association was then explained by the linkages between the major outcomes of deregulation [...] consolidation of the banking industry and diversification of banking activities [...] and the increased volatility of lending into emerging economies. Together, it argues that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>banking</b> deregulation had the unintended and unanticipated side effect of increasing the volatility of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> lending into emerging economies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{documents}} the changing international exposures of U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> balance sheets since the mid- 1980 <b>s.</b> U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> have foreign positions heavily concentrated in Europe, with more volatile flows to {{other regions of}} the world. In recent years some cross-border claims on Latin American countries have declined, while claims extended locally by the branches and subsidiaries of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> have grown. The foreign exposures of larger U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> tend to be less volatile than claims of smaller banks, and locally-issued claims tend to be more stable than cross-border flows. Business cycle variables have mixed influence on U. <b>S.</b> <b>bank</b> cross-border and local claims. The cross-border claims of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> on European customers tend to be procyclical. By contrast, locally generated and cross border claims on Latin American customers of U. <b>S.</b> <b>banks</b> are not robustly related to either U. S. or country-specific business cycle variables.

The Federal Reserve’s actions to support financial marketsand the broader economy have resulted in a large increasein bank reserves—both total reserves and reserves held in excess of legal requirements—since September 2008. 1 Excess reserves have risen from an average of less than 5 percent of total reserves during the 5 years ending in August 2008 to more than 90 percent since November 2008. Many observers contend that the large increase in excess reserves poses a significant inflation risk. A look back at a similar episode during the 1930 s provides some insights about how not to reduce excess reserves. As in the current situation, excess reserves grew rapidly and became a high percentage of total reserves during the mid- 1930 <b>s.</b> <b>Depositor</b> runs on <b>banks</b> and gold outflows caused reserves to contract sharply between 1929 and early 1933; subsequently, reserves began to grow in 1933 with the introduction of federal deposit insurance.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how the lending activities of a multinational <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> affiliates located abroad {{are affected by}} funding difficulties {{in view of the}} financial crisis.

We find that affiliates local deposits and profitability have been stabilizing loan supply. By contrast, relying on short-term wholesale funding has increasingly proven to be a disadvantage in the crisis, as inter-bank and capital markets froze. Besides, the more an affiliate abroad takes recourse to intra-bank funding in the crisis, the more it becomes dependent on a stable deposit and long-term wholesale funding position of its parent bank. We furthermore detect competition for intra-bank funding across the affiliates abroad as well as an increasing focus on the parent <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> home market activities...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} an {{open economy}} portfolio balance model with endogenous asset supply. Domestic producers choose an optimal capital structure and finance capital goods through credit, bonds and equity assets. Private households hold {{a portfolio of}} domestic and foreign assets, shift balances depending on risk-return considerations, and maximise real consumption {{in accordance with the}} law of one price. Within this general equilibrium model, it will be shown that central bank interventions may promote an inefficient international allocation of real capital. The application of expansive monetary interventions throughout the course of economic crises maintains the domestic stock of real capital at the cost of inflation, currency devaluation, distortions of interest rates and asset prices, and risk clusters on the central <b>bank</b> <b>s</b> balance sheet. Exchange rate stabilising interventions have the result that the central bank can also stabilise the domestic stock of real capital.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{contributes to}} the discussion on financial stability and regulation {{in the form of}} five independent articles that empirically explore different facets of systemic risk of banks and insurers. An overview and motivation is given in chapter one. In chapter two, systemic risk for an international panel of insurers is empirically investigated using three prominent measures of systemic risk proposed in the literature as dependent variables in panel regressions. These analyses employ key indicators of systemic relevance suggested by regulators including insurers’ size, leverage, and interconnectedness. The third chapter is a follow-up study to the first analysis and explores the methodology of regulators to detect systemically important financial institutions. Chapter four is dedicated to the relation of stock performance and differences in regulation and supervision of banks around the world. Chapter five of the dissertation introduces two measures of individual and market-level “crisis sentiment” and analyzes its impact on insurer stock prices. Finally, the analyses in chapter six make use of internet search volume data on the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to proxy for the attention and knowledge of U. <b>S.</b> <b>depositors</b> on deposit insurance schemes.
