What about political regimes? Are they taken into account by private banks when they decide whether to invest in a country? Put another way, do private banks have democratic political preferences? In this article, we focus on cross-border lending from international <b>bank(er)</b> <b>s.</b> The questions asked are as follows. Do <b>bank(er)</b> <b>s</b> react positively (that is by increasing their lending) when an emerging democracy appears? Do we witness increased bank lending after democratic transitions?

Our study is also concerned with what kind of support is helpful to high-functioning autistic children and their parents. A total of 11 mothers of children with high-functioning autistic children participated in this study. The 11 autistic children had been diagnosed according to currently used criteria（DSMIV, 1994 ）. The age of these children was from 6 -years-old to 19 -years-old. We are supporting these children in our remedial education class for disability or educational guidance. These mothers gave retrospective answers to a written questionnaire {{with the process of}} acceptanceof their children' s disabilities. The results indicated that the process of parental acceptance of their children' s disabilities involves various factors, such as the characteristics of the child' s disability and the availability of support, and that it is important for us to look at the process of parent' <b>s</b> <b>acceptance</b> of autistic children in relation to their children' s developmental critical period.

The present study examined whether stereotypical {{images of women}} that promote the thinness ideal affect body dissatisfaction and the acceptance of abusive behaviors in romantic relationships in African American women in college. Participants consisted of female students attending Spelman College. Participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} the two levels of the independent variable female image type, thin or average. Participants viewed thirteen female images and then completed three surveys that assessed their body dissatisfaction and acceptance of abusive behaviors. Women 2 ̆ 7 s body dissatisfaction was measured using the PASTAS and the Thompson and Gary Contour Drawing Scale. Women 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>acceptance</b> of abusive behaviors was measured using an adaptation of the IPV Compendium C 3 Index of Psychological Abuse Survey.

40|$|Today 2 ̆ 7 s Western European {{countries}} {{have the world}} 2 ̆ 7 s most extensive government Social welfare systems, beginning with Germany as the forerunner. Prior to the eventual 20 th century German welfare state, Germany was not devoid of distributing aid to combat the effects of poverty. Religious and public benevolent institutions, several centuries earlier, managed local poverty, resulting in an interesting relationship between the German citizens and these charities. The willingness of these institutions to address the poverty issue {{opened the door for}} the 20 th century German welfare state to emerge. This study examines the evolution of the attitudes towards poverty in nineteenth century Germany. Utilizing a longitudinal approach, this work demonstrates that perceptions people held toward poverty in turn shaped welfare policy. This work seeks to connect the changes in the perceptions towards poverty in the nineteenth century with the development of the welfare state in the twentieth century. Through a combination of the shifting political, Social, and economic climate, the issue of poverty was {{at the forefront of the}} German mind from the 1830 s to World War I.
