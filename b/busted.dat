50|$|<b>Busts</b> {{themselves}} {{could have}} detachable wigs. There {{have been many}} suggestions as to why some <b>busts</b> have been created with detachable wigs and some without.

It would have been too expensive to commission a new <b>bust</b> every time hair fashion changed, so a mix-and-match <b>bust</b> would have been preferable for women with less money. Perhaps another reason was to accommodate the Syrian ritual of anointing the skull of the <b>bust</b> with oil.|$|R
