5|$|Three {{positions}} {{are specific to}} the field goal and PAT (point-after-touchdown) unit: the placekicker (K or PK), holder (H) and long snapper (LS). The long snapper's job is to snap the football to the holder, who will catch and position it for the placekicker. There is not usually a holder on kickoffs, because the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> kicked off of a tee; however, a holder {{may be used in}} certain situations, such as if wind is preventing the ball from remaining upright on the tee. The player on the receiving team who catches the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> known as the kickoff returner (KR).|$|E

5|$|A {{field goal}} (FG), worth three points, is scored when the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> placekicked or dropkicked through the {{uprights}} {{and over the}} crossbars of the defense's goalposts. After a PAT attempt or successful field goal the scoring team must kick the ball off to the other team.|$|E
5|$|A {{player is}} only allowed {{to catch a}} fly ball on {{the first step of}} the dugout. If the player has one foot on the first step and his other foot on the second step the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> ruled non-playable and the player is not allowed to catch it.|$|E
5|$|Any runners {{already on}} base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, {{before or after}} the ball lands. A runner on first base must attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes dead and any runners must return to the base they were at when the play began. If the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has flied out and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they tag up or touch the base they were at when the play began, as or after the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> caught. Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher {{is in the process of}} {{delivering}} the ball to home plate—a successful effort is a stolen base.|$|E

By 2000, more than 126 million copies of its tankōbon volumes had been sold in Japan alone. By 2016, this number had grown to pass 156 million in Japan and 240 million worldwide, making it the second best-selling Weekly Shōnen Jump manga of all time. Dragon <b>Ball</b> <b>is</b> credited as {{one of the}} main reasons for the period when manga circulation was at its highest in the mid-1980s and mid-1990s.

5|$|The {{presence}} of charge {{gives rise to}} an electrostatic force: charges exert a force on each other, an effect that was known, though not understood, in antiquity. A lightweight ball suspended from a string can be charged by touching it with a glass rod that has itself been charged by rubbing with a cloth. If a similar <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> charged by the same glass rod, it is found to repel the first: the charge acts to force the two balls apart. Two balls that are charged with a rubbed amber rod also repel each other. However, if one <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> charged by the glass rod, and the other by an amber rod, the two balls are found to attract each other. These phenomena were investigated {{in the late eighteenth}} century by Charles-Augustin de Coulomb, who deduced that charge manifests itself in two opposing forms. This discovery led to the well-known axiom: like-charged objects repel and opposite-charged objects attract.|$|E
5|$|The {{touchdown}} (TD), worth six points, is {{the most}} valuable scoring play in American football. A touchdown is scored when a live <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> advanced into, caught in, or recovered {{in the end zone}} of the opposing team. The scoring team then attempts a try or conversion, more commonly known as the point(s)-after-touchdown (PAT), which is a single scoring opportunity.|$|E

5|$|After {{his time}} with the Indians ended, Coveleski spent three seasons with the Senators and one with the Yankees before {{retiring}} after the 1928 season. He retired to South Bend, Indiana, where he died in 1984. A starting pitcher, Coveleski specialized in throwing the spitball, a pitch where the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> altered with a foreign substance such as chewing tobacco. It was legal when his career began and outlawed in 1920, but {{he was one of}} 17 pitchers permitted to continue throwing the pitch.|$|E
5|$|Another {{feature of}} the <b>ball</b> <b>is</b> its rubber layer; it was {{designed}} to allow a better response while retaining the impact energy and releases it in the coup. Its support material of cross-linked nitrogen-expanded foam improves its retention and durability of its shape. Polyester support fabric enhances structure and stability. The asymmetrical high-contrast graphic around the ball creates an optimal flicker as the ball rotates for a more powerful visual signal, allowing the player to more easily identify and track the ball.|$|E

50|$|In 1961 {{a member}} of the German Underwater Club (DUC) in Cologne, Ludwig von Bersuda, {{came up with the idea}} of an {{underwater}} ball game. Air-filled <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> not suitable for underwater games, as they are buoyant and always return to the surface. The first underwater <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> invented when Bersuda filled the ball with saltwater. Since the density of the <b>ball</b> <b>was</b> now greater than that of normal water, it no longer floated to the surface, but slowly sank to the bottom. The sink rate could, within certain limits, be controlled by the concentration of the salt solution. As soccer <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> too large to <b>be</b> practical, waterpolo <b>balls</b> <b>are</b> used.|$|R
