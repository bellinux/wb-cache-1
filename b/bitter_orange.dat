50|$|The extract of <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> (and <b>bitter</b> <b>orange</b> peel) {{has been}} marketed as dietary {{supplement}} purported {{to act as}} a weight-loss aid and appetite suppressant. <b>Bitter</b> <b>orange</b> contains the tyramine metabolites N-methyltyramine, octopamine and synephrine, substances similar to epinephrine, which act on the α1 adrenergic receptor to constrict blood vessels and increase blood pressure and heart rate.
