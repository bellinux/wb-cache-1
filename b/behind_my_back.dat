500|$|With Disney's backing, the {{production}} team was {{given access to}} 36 hours of Travers' audio recordings of herself, the Shermans, and co-writer Don DaGradi that were produced during the development of Mary Poppins, in addition to letters written between Disney and Travers from the 1940s through the 1960s. Richard M. Sherman also worked on the film as a music supervisor and shared his side of his experiences working with Travers on Mary Poppins. Initially, Hancock had reservations about Disney's involvement with the film, believing that the studio would edit the screenplay in their co-founder's favor. However, Marcel admitted that the studio [...] "specifically didn't {{want to come in}} and sanitize it or change Walt in any way." [...] Hancock elaborated, [...] "I was still worried that they might want to chip away at Walt a little bit...I thought the portrayal of Walt was fair and human so I came in and they said, ‘No, we like it.’ But still, every step of the way, I had my fist balled up <b>behind</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> ready to fight in case it happened, but it didn’t." [...] Although the filmmakers did not receive any creative interference from Disney regarding Walt Disney's depiction, the studio did request that they omit any onscreen inhalation of cigarettes due to the company's policy of not directly depicting smoking in films released under the Walt Disney Pictures banner, and to avoid receiving an R-rating from the Motion Picture Association of America. Instead, Disney is shown extinguishing a lit cigarette in one scene, and his notorious smoker's cough is heard off-screen several times throughout the film.|$|E
2500|$|Police held Verburgh for 48hours of questionings and beatings that {{severely}} injured him, including a separated shoulder. Throughout, Verburgh denied {{involvement in the}} murder. Verburgh's Janitor Union lawyer got Verburgh released on a writ of habeas corpus. Verburgh said of the experience:Oh, they hanged me up, they blindfolded me ... I can't put up my arms, they are sore. They had handcuffs on me for hours and hours. They threw me in the cell and blindfolded me. They handcuffed my hands <b>behind</b> <b>my</b> <b>back</b> and pulled me up on bars until my toes touched the floor. I no eat, I go to the hospital. Oh, I am so sick. Any more and I would have confessed to anything.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{completing}} his army service, Chikatilo {{returned to his}} native village {{to live with his}} parents. He soon became acquainted with a young divorcee, and the pair began a three-month relationship, which ended after several unsuccessful attempts at intercourse, when the woman innocently asked her friends for advice as to how Chikatilo might overcome his inability to maintain an erection. As a result, most of his peers discovered his impotence. In a 1993 interview regarding this incident, Chikatilo stated: [...] "Girls were going <b>behind</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> whispering that I was impotent. I was so ashamed. I tried to hang myself. My mother and some young neighbours pulled me out of the noose. Well, I thought no one would want such a shamed man. So I had to run away from there, away from my homeland." ...|$|E

50|$|The idea <b>behind</b> the Scratch <b>My</b> <b>Back</b> {{project is}} a song {{exchange}} where each artist would cover one of Gabriel's songs in return for his covering one of theirs; the other artists' renditions of Gabriel's songs were to appear on an album entitled I'll Scratch Yours. Initially planned to be released simultaneously with Scratch <b>My</b> <b>Back</b> in 2010, several artists were late in delivering their songs or ultimately declined to participate, necessitating changes to the companion album's concept. With several new artists aboard, the slightly retitled And I'll Scratch Yours was released in September 2013.|$|R
2500|$|In {{her second}} memoir, This 'N That (1987), Davis wrote, [...] "I am still {{recovering}} {{from the fact that}} a child of mine would write about me <b>behind</b> <b>my</b> <b>back,</b> to say nothing about the kind of book it is.

[...] Her memoir concluded with a letter to her daughter, in which she addressed her several times as [...] "Hyman", and described her actions as [...] "a glaring lack of loyalty and thanks for the very privileged life I feel you have been given". She concluded with a reference to the title of Hyman's book, [...] "If it refers to money, if my memory serves me right, I've been your keeper all these many years. I am continuing to do so, as my name has made your book about me a success." ...|$|E

60|$|Whatever {{is it that}} we are {{all looking}} for? I fancy that it is really quite close. When I was a boy I had a fancy that Heaven or Fairyland or {{whatever}} I called it, was immediately <b>behind</b> <b>my</b> own <b>back,</b> and that this was why I could never manage to see it, however often I twisted and turned to take it by surprise. I had a notion of a man perpetually spinning round on one foot like a teetotum in the effort to find that world behind his back which continually fled from him. Perhaps this is why the world goes round. Perhaps the world is always trying to look over its shoulder and catch up the world which always escapes it, yet without which it cannot be itself.|$|R

The blast set them off so that the air rush that came up through the shaft brought the tear gas with it and also collapsed the wall.|$|R
