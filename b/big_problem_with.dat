500|$|Other critics {{felt that}} the film was mediocre in regards to its story and characters, and that it failed to deliver as a non-musical to Disney's {{traditional}} audience. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly gave the film a C+ rating, writing that the film had [...] "gee-whiz formulaic character" [...] and was [...] "the essence of craft without dream". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said the storyline and characterizations were [...] "old-fashioned" [...] and the film had the retrograde look of a Saturday-morning cartoon, but these deficiencies were offset by its [...] "brisk action" [...] and frantic pace. Todd McCarthy of Variety wrote, [...] "Disney pushes into all-talking, no-singing, no-dancing and, in the end, no-fun animated territory." [...] Stephanie Zacharek of Salon wrote of Disney's attempt to make the film for an adult audience, [...] "The <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> Disney's latest animated feature, Atlantis: The Lost Empire, is that it doesn't seem geared to kids at all: It's so adult that it's massively boring." [...] Rita Kempley of The Washington Post panned the film, calling it a [...] "new-fashioned but old-fangled hash" [...] and wrote, [...] "Ironically Disney had hoped to update its image with this mildly diverting adventure, yet the picture hasn't really broken away from the tried-and-true format spoofed in the far superior Shrek."In 2016, watchmojo.com ranked it as the 9th best sci-fi animated film.|$|E

2500|$|The AI-20 is a {{single-shaft}} turboprop with a ten-stage {{axial compressor}} and a three-stage power turbine, {{and is designed}} to run at a constant speed. A <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> early production engines was the poor reliability of the AI-20 engines, which had a time between overhauls (TBO) {{in the range of}} 600 to 750 hours. The AI-20K engine variant was finally introduced, with a TBO of 2,000 hours – unimpressive by modern standards, but a big improvement. One issue that was never addressed was noise; turboprops are relatively noisy and high noise levels were a [...] problem for the passengers. As mentioned, the overhaul life of the engine was initially poor compared with contemporary western engines, being reported as 600–750 hours in 1964, but was later improved by continuous development to 8,000 hours, with a service life of 22,000 hours in the AI-20D series 5M.|$|E
2500|$|While at Stanford, Thiel {{encountered}} René Girard, whose mimetic theory influenced him.

Girard notes the productive potential of competition: [...] "It is because of this unprecedented capacity to promote competition within limits that always remain socially, if not individually, acceptable that {{we have all the}} amazing achievements of the modern world," [...] but states that competition stifles progress once it becomes an end in itself: [...] "rivals are more apt to forget about whatever objects are the cause of the rivalry and instead become more fascinated with one another." [...] Thiel applied this theory to his personal life and business ventures, stating: [...] "The <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> competition is that it focuses us on the people around us, and while we get better at the things we're competing on, we lose sight of anything that's important, or transcendent, or truly meaningful in our world." ...|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately for loyal Oldsmobile customers, GM {{management}} on Woodward Avenue in Detroit were {{focusing on}} cost savings per vehicle by this time, a philosophy later called [...] "less car for more money" [...] by the 1970s. [...] One drawback of this thinking {{was that the}} 1961 through 1964 Oldsmobiles lost their dependable (but expensive to build) Jetaway Hydramatic transmissions. [...] Replacing those time-tested four speed units was a much cheaper to build three speed unit, the Roto Hydramatic. [...] This transmission had no front fluid coupling at all, and utilized a single [...] "fill-and-dump" [...] coupling to perform double duty as both a fluid coupling in third speed while having a third reaction member, which Olds called an [...] "Accel-O-Rotor," [...] which was actually a small stator, thus giving some limited torque multiplication in first. [...] In theory, the [...] "Accel-O-Rotor" [...] would provide the same multiplication range in first as both {{the first and second}} gears of the four speed unit without all the hardware...and cost. [...] It was also unique at that time, in that second speed was pure mechanical connection from engine to rear end...no fluid coupling involved. [...] The <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> this unit in the Oldsmobiles (and lower line Pontiacs of the same era) was engine speed would race wildly in first, and then hit a [...] "brick wall" [...] of a very steep RPM decline in second, which was equivalent to third gear in the four speed Jetaway Hydramatic. [...] This unit was very trouble prone and unreliable, and cost a great deal of performance otherwise obtainable from the Rocket. [...] It would linger for only these three years, when it was replaced by the much more reliable, but less efficient, Turbo Hydramatic in 1965. [...] Customer complaints caused many dealers and independent transmission shops to wholesale replace the Roto Hydramatic in these cars with older (or contemporary, from a Pontiac Star Chief or Bonneville) HM315 four speed Hydramatic.|$|E
2500|$|When it debuted, Fallen Angels {{received}} mixed {{to critical}} notices. In his review for the Associated Press, Scott Williams wrote, 'We're {{asking a lot}} of TV to deliver entertainment about that stylish, moral abyss. Fallen Angels delivers. It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness". The Chicago Sun-Times gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, [...] "Part {{of the problem is}} the series' arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a '90s interpretation of film noir, [...] "Fallen Angels" [...] offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds". In his review for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor called it, [...] "uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level". In his review for the Houston Chronicle, Louis B. Parks wrote, [...] "The <b>big</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. Fallen Angels has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, [...] "Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now for the gifted artisans of Hollywood. Even by today's commonplace high standards, however, {{the look and feel of}} the six Fallen Angels films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, they at least look darn good". Newsweek magazine's David Gates wrote, [...] "no show this summer will do a better job of whisking you away from the increasingly unacceptable '90s. These half hours are all too short". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don't be fooled, this is a boys' fantasy production) dressed up in their dads' big suits".|$|E
