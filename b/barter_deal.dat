40|$|Barter {{trade is}} on the {{increase}} worldwide in both developed and developing countries. This study is aimed at investigating the management practices used by firms involved in barter trading {{in order to ensure}} that they take optimal advantage of benefits of barter trade and minimise its potential problems. Data was collected from 61 barter trade practitioners from the South African media industry. The findings show that most of the firms realise the need to have dedicated personnel responsible for barter trade in their firms. Having dedicated personnel responsible for barter trade helps ensure accountability. The findings also show that most of the firms actively search for barter opportunities, have top management support in their barter trading activities, make use of in-house specialists to negotiate <b>barter</b> <b>deals</b> and have in place clearly defined policies on managing barter trade. Nearly all the policies prescribe products that can be bartered, maximum value of deals acceptable, evaluation criteria for <b>barter</b> <b>deals,</b> accounting and tax treatment of <b>barter</b> <b>deals</b> as well as barter trade authorisation procedures. The findings of the study have practical significance to firms considering using barter trade in their organisations. These have been highlighted in the paper...|$|R

The original order, including options, was for 24 aircraft, but after seeing that the aircraft did not perform well, the Norwegian authorities refused to accept any further Ca.310s. Instead, a delivery of 12 Caproni Ca.312s with upgraded engines and improved performance was substituted, but not delivered before the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940. A similar scenario occurred with other export contracts, especially with a hoped-for Royal Air Force order for bomber trainers being curtailed during negotiations with Caproni when Italy entered the war as an Axis power.|$|E

50|$|Barter is {{the direct}} {{exchange}} of goods between two parties in a transaction. The principal exports are paid for with goods or services supplied from the importing market. A single contract covers both flows, in its simplest form involves no cash. In practice, supply of the principal exports is often held up until sufficient revenues have been earned {{from the sale of}} bartered goods. One of the largest barter deals to date involved Occidental Petroleum Corporation's agreement to ship sulphuric acid to the former Soviet Union for ammonia urea and potash under a 2 year deal which was worth 18 billion euros. Furthermore, during negotiation stage of a <b>barter</b> <b>deal,</b> the seller must know the market price for items offered in trade. Bartered goods can range from hams to iron pellets, mineral water, furniture or olive-oil all somewhat more difficult to price and market when potential customers must be sought.|$|E

Neither deal went through due to an unfavourable regional security environment and high costs; inflation and the budget deficit rose but privatisation was resisted. In the late 1990s the government renegotiated its export and price arrangements with Gazprom and renewed deliveries to Georgia, Ukraine, and some other countries. It also opened its first pipeline not to pass through Russia, the Korpezhe-Kurt Kui Pipeline.|$|R

50|$|Day 14 {{begins with}} most of the {{container}} structure completed, but one notable project that hasn't even started is the firefly. Geoff had put off the project for a long time, and he's forced to use the rest of his $500 for steel studs to build the firefly. As for his orders {{to the rest of the}} team, John is tasked with finding the rest of the sinks needed for the sink wall (as Gordie's chances of finding enough sinks is starting to slim), Katrina with a boardroom table, while Tom and Merv are tasked with preparing the container for installation at the brickworks. John is able to secure a <b>barter</b> <b>deal</b> for the needed sinks, but they do not have the stainless steel needed for bartering. Gordie heads to various sites around Toronto (a Toronto Works and Emergency Services storage locker and a storage space for old Toronto Santa Claus Parade floats) for the stainless steel, but unfortunately he returns with no stainless steel (though he does manage to find parts for the firefly). In a turn of events, Paul receives an offer for the bicycle chair built by Andy that will give them the cash needed to buy the sinks, but Andy refuses to give his consent to sell (despite the clients having stated their dislike for the chair). However, they may not have to sell the chair at all: they had earlier recovered two fudge machines, which contains enough stainless steel that they can trade for the sinks. Unfortunately, at the scrapyard they only have 33 of their 70 sinks, but they had managed to save four stainless steel augers that Andy had fought so hard to keep (as well as $230 in their account).|$|E

Meanwhile, Michelle's frustrations with the project quality reaches a breaking point {{with the rest of the}} crew: when arguing about whether to a tile backsplash, Geoff and Michelle argue for an extended length of time, only for both to be silenced by Cam when he suggests to use the freecycled stainless steel instead. Anthony's junk runs prove fruitful, and a <b>barter</b> <b>deal</b> with a mechanic across the street from the job site allows Jean-Marc to finish his last project—an exercise bike that could also recharge laptop batteries. The budget issue is resolved when Ross suggests that Michelle should [...] "charm" [...] Ron for the money when Ron refuses to answer Geoff's calls; Michelle's plea nets them $500, which they spend on cleaning up the floor and finding some cheap fabrics for upholstery. In the end, all of the projects are completed; however, Ron and a group of his clients will be making the final inspection together. On the final day, the team decides to throw a party in preparation for their arrival, with catering to be provided by one of the restaurants Cam runs. Gordie, however, leaves at the last moment, returning with some freegan food that he found on one last junk run. Though the team is appalled by what Gordie had done, they admit that the food that Gordie had found, which included more expensive items such as proscuitto, was not as bad as they had imagined (it was not until after the party that Gordie reveals that the food was, in fact, not freegan; he had also swapped some of the food for new food). In the end, Ron and his guests were split on whether to order a total tearout, but they eventually decide that the loft should stay. The Junk Raiders experiment is now complete, taking roughly $5400 to build from start to finish.|$|E

40|$|At {{least eight}} {{soapstone}} carvings of birds furnished a shrine, Great Zimbabwe, in the 19 th century. This large stonewalled settlement, once {{a political and}} urban centre, had been much reduced for four centuries, although the shrine continued to operate as local traditions dictated. The Zimbabwe Birds were handed down from a past that has only been partially illuminated by archaeological inquiry and ethnography, as has the site as such. This thesis publishes the first detailed catalogue of the Birds and attempts to reconstruct their provenance at the site based on the earliest written accounts. A modern history of the Birds unfolds when the European settlers removed them from the site in dubious transactions, claiming them as rewards of imperial conquest. As the most treasured objects from Great Zimbabwe, {{the fate of the}} Birds has been intertwined with that of the site in a matrix of contested meanings and ownership. This thesis explores how the meanings of cultural objects have a tendency to shift and to be ephemeral, demonstrating the ability of those in power to appropriate and determine such meanings. In turn, this has a bearing on ownership claims, and gives rise to an “authorized heritage discourse” syndrome.   The forced migrations of the Zimbabwe Birds within the African continent and to Europe and their subsequent return to their homeland decades later are characterised by melodramatic episodes of manoeuvring by traders, politicians and theologians, and of the return of stolen property cloaked as an amicable <b>barter</b> <b>deal,</b> or a return extolled as an act of generosity. International doctrines that urge the return of cultural property are influenced by Western hegemonic ideologies. Natural justice is perverted, as stolen property acquires a (superior) significance in its new context, which merits the extinction of the original provenance. This leaves “generosity” and goodwill as the promises of the future, holding the fate of one Zimbabwe Bird still kept in exile in South Africa. ...|$|E

Based on pricing data of 165 <b>barter</b> <b>deals</b> we find no systematic difference in the pricing behaviour in non-cash transactions across sectors.

50|$|The {{ancestor}} of today’s GEA AG was Metallgesellschaft AG (MG), {{established as a}} metal trading company in 1881 in Germany. Between 1881 and 1914, MG was already represented on all continents, and invested in mines and metallurgical plants. Due to World War I, it lost {{a large proportion of}} foreign investments and started chemical trading. In 1920, Gesellschaft für Entstaubungsanlagen (GEA) was founded by Otto Happel, to produce de-dusting equipment. Due to World War II, MG’s and GEA’s production facilities suffered an extensive destruction. Production started up again with about 70 employees in a small, undamaged building {{a few weeks after the}} war ended. At that time, many business transactions--including salaries--were <b>barter</b> <b>deals.</b> While reconstruction work progressed in the following years, the company was hit hard once again.

5000|$|Only since 2000 has {{the wartime}} Irish economy been studied, {{away from the}} grander issues of {{diplomacy}} and warfare. Being still largely dependent on Britain for coal, manufactured goods and fuel oils, supplies of these were reduced {{after the fall of}} France in mid-1940, causing price inflation and a busy black market. It was said that [...] "the poor are like hunted rats looking for bread", as wheat supplies fell, and that the introduction of full rationing was [...] "seriously belated". Typhus reappeared and the government started planning for famine relief in late 1941. John Betjeman, the British press attaché in Dublin, reported [...] "No coal. No petrol. No gas. No electric. No paraffin. Guinness good." [...] In March 1942 the government banned the export of beers, and decided that more wheat should be grown, and less barley. The prospect of a shortage of beer led on to <b>barter</b> <b>deals</b> whereby Britain supplied wheat suitable for making bread flour, and coal, and in return Ireland allowed the export of beers. [...] "These supplies were to keep neutral Ireland afloat during World War II and enable the continuance of Irish neutrality".|$|R
50|$|Although Hitler was {{credited}} with lowering unemployment from 6 million (some sources claim the real figure was as high as 11m) to virtually nil by conscription and by launching enormous public works projects (similar to Roosevelt's New Deal), as with the Autobahn construction he {{had little interest in}} economics and Germany's 'recovery' was in fact achieved primarily by rearmament and other artificial means conducted by others. Because Germany was nowhere as wealthy in real terms as she had been a generation earlier, with very low reserves of foreign exchange and zero credit, Hjalmar Schacht, and later Walther Funk, as Minister of Economy used a number of financial devices - some very clever - to manipulate the currency and gear the German economy towards Wehrwirtschaft (War Economy). One example was the Mefo bill, a kind of IOU produced by the Reichsbank to pay armaments manufacturers but which was also accepted by German banks. Because Mefo bills did not figure in government budgetary statements, they helped maintain the secret of rearmament and were, in Hitler's own words, merely a way of printing money. Schacht also proved adept at negotiating extremely profitable <b>barter</b> <b>deals</b> with many other nations, supplying German military expertise and equipment in return.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we survey the common {{explanations}} of barter in transition economies and {{expose them to}} detailed survey data on 165 <b>barter</b> <b>deals</b> in Ukraine in 1997. The evidence {{does not support the}} notion that soft budget constraints, lack of restructuring, or that the virtual economy are the driving forces behind barter. Further, tax avoidance is only weakly associated with the incidence of barter in Ukraine. We then explore an alternative explanation of barter as a mechanism to address transitional challenges where capital markets and economic institutions are poorly developed. First, barter helps to maintain production by creating a deal-specific collateral which softens the liquidity squeeze in the economy when credit enforcement is prohibitively costly. Second, barter helps to maintain production by preventing firms being exploited by their input suppliers when the suppliers' bargaining position is very strong due to high costs of switching suppliers. Thus, in the absence of trust and functioning capital markets barter is a self-enforcing response to imperfect input and financial markets in the former Soviet Union. The paper concludes by discussing potential long-term costs of barter arrangements, and by suggesting particular pitfalls of expansionary monetary policy in barter economies such as Ukraine and Russia.

40|$|The author dwells on {{the causes}} of the {{growling}} importance of bilateral barter agreements in East-Wiest tirade. To the principle clauses in the development of barter trade belong: the economic recession in the capitalist countries the rampant inflation in the western world and last but mot least the depreciation of western currencies. The said factors reawakened interest in barter transactions. The bilateral barter arrangements, of course, have always been broadly practised in trade transactions between socialist countries and in trade relations of the latter with Third World countries. The paper contains a few examples of the numerous barter arrangements with western countries. The author next proceeds to describe and analyse the main types of <b>barter</b> <b>deals,</b> that is to say clearing, switch operations, compensatiom and buy back barter. Finally, tine author drawls attention to the fact, that barter arrangements are being not only commonly used in foreign trade but also — as the American practice shows it — in purely internal trade transactions. The big concerns are switching to barter in order to secure for themselves regular and big supplies of rare raw materials and semi-finished goods, thus depriving small and medium enterprises access to needed vital supplies.

40|$|Industry in Ukraine {{is among}} the world's most energy intensive. Energy was {{plentiful}} and cheap in Soviet times and little {{effort was made to}} conserve it. Rising energy prices have had a major impact on profits and production, which also creates a tremendous market potential for energy efficient products and services. Yet Ukrainian industry has not implemented significant energy efficiency measures in recent years. The Ukrainian government has placed energy efficiency and industrial development at the top of its priorities. Energy efficiency can help Ukraine improve its security, economy and environment. Ukraine's energy imports represent a key national security issue because Ukraine imports over half its energy from Russia, making it vulnerable to that nation's demands. Energy efficiency can provide jobs and can help make Ukrainian industry more competitive internationally. Industrial production has plummeted as a result of economic collapse and inefficiency; some of this production and energy demand may never return because of economic restructuring. Ukraine would like to minimise the drop in production to reduce the nation's economic pains. Energy efficiency can also help protect the environment, both in Ukraine and globally. In short, Ukraine has many good reasons for improving its market for industrial energy efficiency. This paper examines the forces influencing energy efficiency decision making in the industrial sector and suggests effective means of changing old energy habits and buying patterns. Important aspects of this issue include ownership, organisational structure, financial performance, compensation, barter, and taxation. Tax policy provides an incentive to conduct business through <b>barter</b> <b>deals</b> because such transactions can evade high taxes. Thus, a plant [...] ...|$|R
