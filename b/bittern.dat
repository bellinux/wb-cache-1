5|$|Folklorist Campbell of Islay has {{speculated that}} {{descriptions}} of the boobrie may be based on sightings of the great auk. The bellowing sound made by the boobrie, more like a bull than a bird, may have its origin in the strange call of the common <b>bittern,</b> which was a rare visitor to Scotland.|$|E

5000|$|A [...] "Bird Conservation Area" [...] at {{the park}} protects {{breeding}} habitat for several regionally-threatened bird species, including pied-billed grebes, American <b>bitterns,</b> least <b>bitterns,</b> and black terns.|$|R
5000|$|The marsh {{is also an}} {{important}} breeding site for black terns and least <b>bitterns.</b> [...] At least 1% of the breeding pairs of least <b>bitterns</b> in Canada nest in the Wye Marsh.|$|R
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian <b>bittern</b> and bearded reedling, and the island-nesting avocet. Other birds nesting in the wetland include northern lapwing, common redshank and sedge, reed and Cetti's warblers. Eurasian spoonbills, ruffs and black-tailed godwits are present {{for much of the}} year, and a pair of little egrets bred {{for the first time in}} 2010–2012.|$|E
5|$|In {{anticipation}} of the restoration, the spare A3 boiler had been dispatched in June 2005 to Riley & Son to be completely rebuilt. It was to be used instead of the A4 boiler both out of the desire to restore the locomotive to original condition, {{and because it was}} deemed that the A4 boiler had deteriorated into a worse state than the spare due to the higher operating pressures the locomotive had experienced following the up-rating of the locomotive to 250psi during its last private overhaul. Deemed surplus to requirements, the A4 boiler was sold to Jeremy Hosking for potential use on his locomotive, LNER Class A4 4464 <b>Bittern.</b>|$|E
5|$|It has two {{landscaped}} picnic areas. Facilities {{include a}} tea shop, with {{indoor and outdoor}} seating areas {{with a view of}} the lake, and information centre. There are a souvenir shop and small art gallery and two nature trails. The Grebe Trail is a hard-surfaced, all-weather path suitable for pedestrians, pushchairs and wheelchairs and covers a circuit 0.75miles (1.2km) long, starting and finishing at the wooded picnic area. The <b>Bittern</b> Trail is reached from the Grebe Trail by the footbridge over Hollow Brook. The grassy path is often waterlogged in winter, but there is a boardwalk over a short section. The trail runs along the east shore, visits an open bird hide and returns to the footbridge, making a 1-mile (1.5-kilometre) circuit. Bristol Water imposes conditions on visitors, particularly related to the areas where dogs are allowed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bitterns</b> are a {{classification}} of {{birds in the}} heron family of Pelican order of wading birds. Species named <b>bitterns</b> {{tend to be the}} shorter-necked, often more secretive members of this family. They were called hæferblæte in Old English; the word [...] "bittern" [...] came to English from Old French butor, itself from Gallo-Roman butitaurus, a compound of Latin būtiō and taurus. <b>Bitterns</b> form a monophyletic subfamily in the heron family, the Botaurinae.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bitterns</b> were {{recorded}} as breeding in 2016.|$|R
50|$|Herons, <b>bitterns,</b> little <b>bitterns,</b> ducks, geese and swans are {{commonly}} {{seen on the}} Eiswoog. Osprey, on the other hand, are only seen occasionally. One strictly protected species, the kingfisher, nests by the lake. The wheatear, which is rare in Germany, has been registered as a passage migrant.|$|R
5|$|Other British Birds rarities {{that have}} been sighted (single records unless {{otherwise}} indicated) are: Little <b>bittern,</b> glossy ibis, gyrfalcon (3 records), little and Baillon's crakes, collared pratincole, semipalmated (5 records), least (2 records), white-rumped and Baird's (2 records) sandpipers, Wilson's phalarope, laughing gull, bridled tern, Pallas's sandgrouse, great spotted, black-billed and yellow-billed (3 records) cuckoos, European roller, olive-backed pipit, citrine wagtail, Alpine accentor, thrush nightingale, red-flanked bluetail, black-eared (2 records) and desert wheatears, White's, Swainson's (3 records), and grey-cheeked (2 records) thrushes, Sardinian (2 records), Arctic (3 records), Radde's and western Bonelli's warblers, Isabelline and lesser grey shrikes, red-eyed vireo (7 records), two-barred crossbill, yellow-rumped and blackpoll warblers, yellow-breasted (2 records) and black-headed (3 records) buntings, rose-breasted grosbeak (2 records), bobolink and Baltimore oriole (2 records).|$|E
5|$|The River Brue and {{its tributaries}} support a {{population}} of European eels (Anguilla anguilla). Reptiles found include the European adder (Vipera berus) and grass snake (Natrix natrix). Multiple bird species include Bewick's swan (Cygnus columbianus bewickii), Eurasian <b>bittern</b> (Botaurus stellaris), Eurasian bullfinch (Pyrrhula pyrrhula), *Eurasian wigeon (Anas penelope), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), gadwall (Anas strepera), grasshopper warbler (Locustella naevia), hen harrier (Circus cyaneus), house sparrow (Passer domesticus), linnet (Carduelis cannabina), marsh harrier (Circus aeruginosus), marsh tit (Poecile palustris), merlin (Falco columbarius), northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), peregrine (Falco peregrinus), reed bunting (Emberiza schoeniclus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), skylark (Alauda arvensis), song thrush (Turdus philomelos), teal (Anas cracca), willow tit (Poecile montanus) and yellowhammer (Emberiza citrinella).|$|E
5|$|The key {{breeding}} {{species are}} reed bed specialists {{such as the}} marsh harrier, Eurasian <b>bittern</b> and bearded reedling, together with the avocet, the RSPB's symbolic bird. Bitterns stopped breeding on the reserve in 1989 due to inadequate habitat {{and a lack of}} sufficient large food fish; although European eels, a favoured food, are present, the numbers are too low. These problems were addressed by managing water levels and excavating some of the reed bed to create open, reed-fringed pools, and stocking the lagoon with the common rudd; breeding recommenced in 2004. In 2011, there were 80 avocet nests, two pairs of Eurasian bitterns, and four pairs of marsh harriers, the latter successfully fledging seven young.|$|E

5|$|Wanting {{to reunite}} with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking {{him back to}} the Land of the Living by pretending he wants her to meet his parents. She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, to return Victor and Emily {{temporarily}} to the Land of the Living. Once back home, Victor asks Emily to wait in the forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings. Just as they are about to share a kiss, Emily arrives and sees the two of them together. Feeling betrayed and hurt, she angrily drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead. Victoria tells her parents that Victor has been forcibly wed to a dead woman, but no one believes her. With Victor gone, Victoria's parents decide to marry her off against her will to a presumed-wealthy newcomer in town named Lord Barkis <b>Bittern,</b> who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.|$|E

His crew rowed all 36 hours without a break, not even for meals, and covered some 60 miles without the assistance of any wind.|$|E
