500|$|During {{the sixth}} {{hour of the}} race Gary Hirsch lost power in his Greaves Gibson-Nissan through the Esses {{and came to a}} halt; the car would later be {{abandoned}} after Hirsch was unable to repair a broken <b>battery</b> <b>terminal.</b> The No. 71 Ferrari was forced to the garage to fix starter motor problems, bowing out of its battle with Corvette and Aston Martin in LMGTE Pro. As dusk settled on the circuit, the No. 18 Porsche of Dumas braked too late for Mulsanne Corner and hit a tyre barrier. The car was able to return to the pit lane, only requiring new front bodywork, but the car fell to fifth position. Not long after Paul-Loup Chatin crashed his Signatech Alpine at Mulsanne Corner, bringing the safety cars out for the third time of the race. During this slow period Rob Bell pulled the No. 97 Aston Martin off course and onto the inside run-off area at the Mulsanne Straight and retired. When racing resumed, Hülkenberg was able to attack the leaders, first overtaking Webber's Porsche around the outside on the opening lap then passing Rast when he made a scheduled pit stop. Webber was later given a one-minute stop and go penalty for passing in a yellow flag zone, dropping him to fourth place. Nissan lost one of their three LMP1 entries when Tsugio Matsuda's No. 21 car stopped at Arnage with a suspension failure that caused its front-left wheel to detach from the vehicle and was unable to continue.

50|$|Page's {{innovation}} was {{to construct}} a spiral conductor having cups filled with mercury (element) as electrical connectors that were placed at various positions along its length. He then connected one terminal from an electrochemical cell battery to the inner cup of the spiral, and put the other <b>battery</b> <b>terminal</b> into some other cup of the spiral. The direct battery current flowed through the spiral, from cup to cup. He held a metal wand in each hand, and put these wands into the same two cups as where the battery terminals went — or any other pair of cups. When an assistant removed one of the battery terminals, stopping the current from going in the spiral, Page received a shock. He reported stronger shocks when his hands covered more of the spiral's length than where direct battery current went. He even felt shocks from parts of the spiral where no direct battery current passed. He used acupuncture needles, pierced into his fingers, to amplify his sense of shock. While Page advocated {{the use of this}} shocking device as a medical treatment, an early form of electrotherapy, his own interest lay in its heightening of electrical tension, or voltage above that of the low voltage battery input, and in its other electrical behaviors. Page went on to improve the instrument, giving it the name 'Dynamic Multiplier'.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a new {{mathematical}} model in semi-empirical form for lead-acid batteries is presented, which describes {{the relationship between}} the <b>battery</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage and the variable discharge current. Based on the proposed model, a new estimation method of the battery available capacity (BAC) in the presence of variable discharge currents is developed. The method involves the real-time identification of the model parameters which are then used to estimate the BAC according to the predefined cutoff voltage and the trend of <b>battery</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage during discharging. Thus, both temperature and aging influences on the BAC are considered inherently. Comparisons between the calculated results and the measured data confirm that the proposed method can provide an accurate real-time estimation of the BAC under variable discharge currents. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|Abstract — We propose and {{experimentally}} validate a {{new class}} of models for the total thrust generation in multi-rotor UAVs which is suitable for low- and middle-end platforms. Differently from typical models assuming to instantaneously control the rotor spinning velocity, in the proposed class we consider that the total thrust has its own dynamics and its final value explicitly depends both on the pseudo-setpoint commands given to the motor driver and the measurement of the <b>battery</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage. We compare the different model instances within the class using a principled experimental setup in which the total thrust is precisely measured using a motion capture system as ground truth, instead of relying on a setup based or noise-prone force sensors. We then show that the use of a dynamical model that includes also the <b>battery</b> <b>terminal</b> voltage significantly improves the prediction ability of the model in terms of accuracy. Finally we show how the proposed model can be identified using on-board only acceleration measurements, achieving a surprisingly good accuracy when compared with the ground truth case. We expect that the use of the proposed model will be important both in case of precise flight control {{and in the case of}} aerial physical interactive tasks. I...|$|E
