The letters stand for asymmetry, border, color, and diameter. Sometimes, the letter E (for elevation or evolving) is added. According to the American Academy of Dermatology, if a mole starts changing in size, color, shape or, especially, if the border of a mole develops ragged edges or becomes larger than a pencil eraser, it would be an appropriate time to consult with a physician. Other warning signs include a mole, even if smaller than a pencil eraser, that is different from the others and begins to crust over, bleed, itch, or become inflamed. The changes may indicate developing melanomas. The matter can become clinically complicated because mole removal depends on which types of cancer, if any, come into suspicion.|$|E

[...] Much of Brown's work was given a nihil obstat and an imprimatur (the [...] "nihil obstat" [...] is a statement by an official reviewer, appointed by a bishop, that [...] "nothing stands in the way" [...] of a book being given an imprimatur; the [...] "imprimatur," [...] which must normally be issued by a bishop of the diocese of publication, is the official endorsement – [...] "let it be printed" [...] – that a book contains nothing damaging to Catholic faith and morals).

Thus the models do not necessarily belong to a single bibliographical source, but may be combinations of similar ideas represented by different sources.
