5|$|Wooden casks {{were still}} in use in the 1960s. The cask beer line was removed in 1976, but {{restored}} in 1984. In 1984 the original <b>brewhouse</b> was converted into a brewery museum. In November 1985 a new £5 million <b>brewhouse</b> opened. Production of Foster's Lager began in 1987. By 1989 the brewery had a production capacity of 1.2 million barrels per annum. Scottish & Newcastle used the John Smith's Brewery to brew many of its ale brands. In 2004, a new £24 million bottling facility was opened in 2004, described as the most modern bottling facility in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the John Smith's brands {{included}} Yorkshire Bitter, Magnet Pale Ale, Export Pale, Sweet Stout, Double Brown and Magnet Old. In December 1983, John Smith's Cask (3.8% ABV) was re-introduced, {{seven years}} after it had been phased out. By June 1985, John Smith's produced 1.7 million hectolitres of beer annually. In November that year, a new <b>brewhouse</b> was opened, {{at the cost of}} £5 million. Production of Foster's lager began in 1987.|$|E
5|$|Several sites {{along the}} River Tone {{are set to}} undergo renovation. Firepool Weir lock— long silted up— will be dredged during 2011 to allow boats to pass from the navigable section of the Tone through Taunton to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. Goodland Gardens has {{received}} a makeover and a new cafe, The Shed, has opened. Projects to develop Somerset Square (the paved area next to the <b>Brewhouse</b> Theatre) and Longrun Meadow (country park near to SCAT) have already been delivered.|$|E

40|$|The {{complementarity}} of simulation {{and analytical}} methodologies {{is illustrated by}} a study following the general objective of modelling and optimizing the <b>brewhouses</b> of an industrial brewery. During this study, an extensive simulation model of the <b>brewhouses</b> of an industrial Belgian brewery has been developed {{within the framework of}} the simulation package BATCHES. The use of this simulation model has been complemented by the use of a simple analytical method in order to achieve a quick and efficient design of a new optimized configuration for the <b>brewhouses,</b> representing a notable reduction of the number of equipment items. A series of simulation runs have finally been used to refine this alternative configuration and prove its operability. While such a dual methodology is shown to be easily implemented and used, an economic study has shown that the unit price of production capacity of the <b>brewhouses</b> can consequently be reduced by about 30 % in comparison to the base case...|$|R
40|$|While {{following}} the general objective of modelling and optimizing the ''hot part'' of the brewing process, a detailed simulation {{model of the}} <b>brewhouses</b> of an industrial Belgian brewery has been developed {{within the framework of}} the simulation package Batches, The use of this simulation model has made possible a thorough study of the utilization rates of the <b>brewhouses</b> equipment which have clearly appeared to be generally under-used and sometimes largely oversized. Taking into account these observations, a new optimized configuration for the <b>brewhouses,</b> representing a notable reduction of the number of equipment items, has been suggested, A very large series of simulation runs have proven the feasibility of this alternative configuration, provided that a strict control of the production planning be enforced. An economic study has shown that the unit price of production capacity can be reduced by about 30 % in comparison with the base case, when adopting the suggested configuration...|$|R
5|$|The area by {{the river}} north of the centre is {{surrounded}} by Morrisons supermarket, retirement housing and the <b>Brewhouse</b> Theatre. Towards the centre, is the Zinc Nightclub, Bridge Street and Goodlands Gardens. Currently a regeneration programme is being executed, north of Bridge Street, which will include redeveloping the County Cricket Ground. The cricket ground has hosted large open-air music concerts for Elton John in 2006 and 2012, and for Rod Stewart in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{house was}} built over the old cloisters and the main rooms are on the first floor. It is a stone house with stone slated roofs, twisted chimney stacks and mullioned windows. Throughout {{the life of the}} building, many {{architectural}} alterations, additions, and renovations have occurred so that the house is a mish-mash of different periods and styles. The Tudor stable courtyard {{to the north of the}} house has retained many of its original features including the old <b>brewhouse</b> and bakehouse.|$|E
5|$|The theatre in Taunton {{town centre}} is the <b>Brewhouse</b> Theatre. This closed in February 2013 due to {{financial}} difficulties but was reopened in April 2014 by the Taunton Theatre Association (TTA) who were granted the lease from Taunton Deane Borough Council who {{had bought the}} 61-year lease of the site and its contents from administrator. Tacchi-Morris Arts Centre is a professional theatre based at Heathfield Community School hosting touring theatre, dance and comedy, as well as productions by South West schools and colleges. Tacchi-Morris Arts Centre also runs numerous community classes. The Creative Innovation Centre CIC has an arts and culture venue in the town centre.|$|E
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{simulation model}} of the four <b>brewhouses</b> of an industrial brewery has been developed {{with the help of}} BATCHES, a software dedicated to the simulation of batch and semi-continuous processes. The use of this model has allowed a thorough study of the utilization rates of the pieces of equipment of the <b>brewhouses</b> as well as an analysis of the energy consumption profiles. Taking into account that the utilization rates are generally quite low and that some pieces of equipment are largely oversized, two new configurations for the <b>brewhouses</b> have been proposed, reducing by up to one third the number of pieces of equipment. On the side of the energy study, the combination of the proposed modifications of the process, namely a better standardization of the brewing plant, an adequate production planning and a voluntary limitation of the steam availability level, permits a considerable reduction of the peak energy demands. From the most unfavourable to the most favourable situation encountered during this simulation study, the global reduction amounts to 46 %...|$|R
50|$|The tower {{house was}} {{extended}} {{in the late}} 14th century to add additional private chambers and a prison. The outer courtyard (called more properly the barmkin) was completed and ancillary buildings (stables, bakehouses, <b>brewhouses,</b> smithy, etc.) built against the barmkin wall.|$|R

25|$|Despite an {{announcement}} in June 2007 that the fourth <b>Brewhouse</b> stout would be launched in October that year, no new beer appeared and, {{at the end}} of 2007, the <b>Brewhouse</b> series appeared to have been quietly cancelled.|$|E
25|$|The renovated <b>Brewhouse</b> was {{completed}} in November 2002, {{after two years of}} extensive renovations. The west side of the Brewhouse's low as developed into Brewery Tower, an office building. The upper floors of the historic buildings are office space, and the first floors contain retail. Henry's 12th Street Tavern, in the <b>Brewhouse</b> building, continues the building's historical connection to beer. The building was awarded an LEED certification.|$|E
25|$|The firm of Whidden & Lewis, Portland's {{pioneering}} architects, {{designed the}} <b>Brewhouse.</b> The building is designed in a medieval Tuscan style. Completed in 1908, other {{businesses in the}} area hired architects to emulate this design theme when building their own warehouses and industrial buildings. At its highest level, the structure has six floors. The structure is actually two buildings that appear as one: The <b>Brewhouse</b> (on {{the north side of}} the block), and the Malt and Hop Building (facing Burnside Street).|$|E
50|$|Process engineeringBreweries can be {{completely}} equipped with <b>brewhouses,</b> including fermenting and storage cellar equipment, along with assigned supply installations. Further, the company supplies syrup areas, mixing and carbonising equipment for manufacturing plants of non-alcoholic beverages.

40|$|A {{detailed}} {{simulation model}} of the <b>brewhouses</b> of an industrial Belgian brewery has been developed {{within the framework of}} the simulation package Batches. The use of this model in combination with a custom coded software has made possible an energy integration study focused on a better control of the steam consumption profiles in the <b>brewhouses.</b> These profiles were shown to exhibit a verify irregular behaviour with some demand peaks of very short duration which greatly exceed the mean demand. However, the choice of an adequate production planning can give rise to a considerable reduction (up to 44 % in the case studied) of the highest steam consumption peaks. Finally, some economic considerations are presented about the cost benefits that can be expected from a better control of the steam consumption profiles, as well from the point of view of the boiler house investment costs as from that of the operating costs...|$|R
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed {{in order to achieve}} peak utility load reduction in batch processes operated periodically and under uncertainty. Based on a combination of computer simulation and an analytically based approach, the former {{with the help of the}} BATCHES simulator, this methodology has been applied while following the general objective of modelling and optimizing the <b>brewhouses</b> of an industrial brewery. The steam consumption profiles in these <b>brewhouses</b> exhibit a very irregular behaviour with some demand peaks of very short duration which greatly exceed the average demand. The use of the presented methodology has enabled us to suggest a series of measures resulting in a considerable reduction of the steam consumption peaks. These measures are: a better standardization of the equipment, the choice of an optimized production schedule and the acceptance of a voluntary limitation of the steam availability level. From the most unfavourable situation to the most favourable encountered in our study, the global reduction amounts to 55 %...|$|R

40|$|While {{following}} the general objective of modelling and optimizing {{the operation of}} the hot part of the brewing process, we have suggested a new concept for the configuration of the <b>brewhouses,</b> quite different from the one currently in operation, The latter is based on the use of multipurpose vessels that could be used indiscriminately as mash mixers, mash coppers or boiling coppers, Moreover, none of these vessels would be equipped with heat exchange surfaces, but external heat exchangers (cookers) would rather be used, With the help of a very detailed simulation model, a large series of simulation runs have been performed {{on the basis of this}} new configuration, and have proven its practical operability, The use of such a configuration with 9 multipurpose vessels would give rise to an increased flexibility of the <b>brewhouses</b> and to large savings in investment costs, which have been evaluated and reach 41 % in terms of unit price of production capacity...|$|R
50|$|Between the 15th and 16th centuries, {{after the}} Plague brought {{the commercialization of}} brewing, non-married brewsters began slowly disappearing from the trade. Non-married brewsters' {{part-time}} or occasional status, lack of accessibility to capital, and lack of a centralized physical location in which to sell their product led to their marginalization by the 16th century. By this time, many non-married women seeking to participate in brewing and the ale trade became tapsters, tipplers, and wageworkers in <b>brewhouses</b> for commercial male brewers.|$|R
50|$|Tadcaster {{has a long}} {{association}} with the brewing industry because of the quality and accessibility of the local water supply. Rich in lime sulphate after filtering through limestone, in the right conditions freshwater springs - known locally as popple-wells - still bubbling up near St Mary's church. Tax registers from 1341 record the presence of two thriving breweries or <b>brewhouses</b> in the town, one paying 8d in tax and the other 4d. Today it is second in importance only to Burton-upon-Trent as an English brewing centre.|$|R

25|$|In early 2000, local {{developers}} Gerdling-Edlen {{purchased the}} entire brewing complex, {{which consisted of}} five blocks {{by the end of}} brewing operations. GBD proceeded to develop a mixed-use area consisting of offices, retail, and condo towers known as the Brewery Blocks. As part of the project, historic buildings were to be preserved and integrated into the new development. The <b>brewhouse's</b> historical importance was recognized with a listing on the National Register of Historic Places, along with the A.B. Smith Building's art deco facade, in August 2000, a year after brewing had ceased.|$|R
50|$|He died in 1478 and {{was buried}} in the church of the Augustine friars, within the ward of Broad Street in London. He had married Elizabeth, the {{daughter}} and coheiress of Alderman Philip Malpas, {{one of the leaders of}} the Lancastrian party within the city. They had one daughter and four sons, the eldest of whom was Philip, who was afterwards knighted. Thomas Cook'e will stated that he owned at least four <b>brewhouses,</b> taverns, and beerhouses, besides fishing-weirs on the Colne, a large farm at Gidea Hall, and numerous properties and manors in London, Surrey, Essex, and Kent.|$|R
50|$|The run off tubes {{should be}} evenly {{distributed}} across the bottom, with one tube servicing about 1 m2 of area. Typically, these tubes have a wide, shallow cone around them to prevent compaction of the grain directly above the outlet. In the past, the run-off tubes flowed through swan-neck valves into a wort collection grant. While visually appealing, this system {{led to a}} lot of oxygen uptake. Such a system has mostly been replaced either by a central wort-collection vessel or the arrangement of outlet ports into concentric zones, with each zone having a ring-shaped collection pipe. <b>Brewhouses</b> in plain public view, particularly those in brewpubs, often maintain the swan-neck valves and grant for their visual effect.|$|R
25|$|The cloister, frater (refectory) {{and kitchen}} were totally rebuilt. A new abbot's lodging {{and a great}} hall were added. In the early 14th century, land was {{acquired}} for a cellarer's range (living and working quarters for the cellarer {{who was responsible for}} provisioning the abbey's cellarium), a <b>brewhouse,</b> a bakehouse, and a new walled vineyard. A Lady chapel was built to the east of the church.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s Tetley {{benefited from}} the {{increase}} in sales of cask ale. An impartial customer survey in the 1980s concluded that Tetley had achieved an almost irrational level of customer support, particularly in West Yorkshire, {{in part because of}} traditional loyalty, partly because of highly effective television campaigns such as the Tetley Bittermen, and also because of a consistently high quality product. The <b>brewhouse</b> was updated in 1984.|$|E

50|$|Monastery <b>brewhouses,</b> from {{different}} religious orders, have existed across Europe since the Middle Ages. From the very beginning, beer was brewed in French Cistercian monasteries following the Strict Observance. For example, the monastery of La Trappe in Soligny already {{had its own}} brewery in 1685. Breweries were later introduced in monasteries of other countries as the Trappist order spread from France {{into the rest of}} Europe. The Trappists, like many other religious orders, originally brewed beer to feed the community, in a perspective of self-sufficiency. Nowadays, Trappist breweries also brew beer to fund their works and charitable causes. Many of the Trappist monasteries and breweries were destroyed during the French Revolution and the World Wars. In the last 300 years, there were at least nine Trappist breweries in France, six in Belgium, two in the Netherlands, one in Germany, one in Austria, one in Bosnia and possibly other countries.|$|R
