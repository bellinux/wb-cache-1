"My {{favorite}} {{thing that we}} ever recorded, ever—or wrote—is 'Oh Father'... <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> when we did it, {{that there was something}} about this that was in a way kind of the most *real* thing. [...] that song, the 'record' button was only pressed three times. That's it. So it's real. It's something that I really wanted to do and she was kind enough to say 'let's try this,' and it was not easy." ...|$|E

[...] They got {{matching}} tattoos of each other's initials; in Wood's case, a [...] "J" [...] on her left ankle. After a year together, the relationship ended in 2006. Wood later commented that, [...] "We had matching tattoos <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> our love would last forever. Trouble is, it didn't, things happened, we split. But I don't regret the tattoo. It {{reminds me of a}} great, great period in my life." ...|$|E
500|$|Alesi {{attacked}} Briatore's role {{in preventing}} the drivers from abiding by the pact {{that was to}} see no overtaking {{in the first two}} chicanes and told the Italian and French media that some team principals threatened their drivers if they did not race. Nevertheless, he was relieved that the race passed without any major incident and said the reason why the majority of the drivers supported Michael Schumacher was that he [...] "behaved like a perfect leader". Villeneuve said to British television station ITV that he felt discussing a no overtaking pact at the race circuit was not the appropriate place: [...] "We are race car drivers, Because we signed contracts before the season and everyone was happy to be a race car driver and to earn millions of dollars. <b>Because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> a year ago {{that there would be a}} race at Monza and nobody complained." [...] FIA president Max Mosley stated that he disagreed with the pact and said that the drivers should have raised the concerns in the months leading up to the Grand Prix.|$|E

500|$|As Petrucci and Rudess {{felt that}} the album needed real string lines and choirs, {{as well as other}} organic sounds, they enlisted the help of veteran {{composer}} David Campbell to assist with aspects of the orchestration and handle the logistics of recording all of the necessary musicians. Reflecting on the process for Keyboard, Rudess explained, [...] "Our initial thought was, let’s do it all on rock instruments and let David arrange it, but that wasn’t really thinking ahead in terms of who we are. When we go into the studio, we tend to work on things until they’re pretty polished. So we got into what we called pre-orchestrating. I’d use any sound at my disposal to place strings where we wanted to hear strings, choir where we wanted choir, and so forth—but without getting overly specific about a certain patch or instrument library being the one, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> it was all going to be replaced with real players." [...] Once the album's arrangements were complete, they were performed and recorded in studios around the world, with Campbell conducting and leading the sessions from Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{previous}} Israeli withdrawal, Palestinian militants had prepared by boobytrapping both {{the town and}} camp's streets {{in a bid to}} trap Israeli soldiers. Following his surrender to Israeli forces, Thabet Mardawi, an Islamic Jihad fighter, said that Palestinian fighters had spread [...] "between 1000 and 2000 bombs and booby traps" [...] throughout the camp, some big ones for tanks (weighing as much as 113 kilograms), most others the size of water bottles. [...] "Omar the Engineer", a Palestinian bombmaker, said that some 50 homes were booby trapped: [...] "We chose old and empty buildings and the houses of men who were wanted by Israel <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>knew</b> the soldiers would search for them." [...] More powerful bombs with remote detonators were placed inside trash bins in the street and inside the cars of wanted men. Omar said that everyone in the camp, including children, knew where the explosives were located, and noted that this constituted a major weakness to their defenses, since during the Israeli incursion, the wires to {{more than a third of}} the bombs were cut by soldiers guided by collaborators.|$|E

Carlos Moya (2006) attributes some such theory to Richard Moran (2001) and criticises it {{on the grounds of}} circularity. In this paper, I examine the view attributed to Moran.
