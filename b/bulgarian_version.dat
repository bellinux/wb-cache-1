5|$|Meksi did {{not live}} to see the 1827 {{publication}} of his translation of the New Testament; he had died a bachelor six years earlier, at the age of about 51. The first publication of a Bible translation from Greek to a modern Balkanic language, it ran to 2,000copies, a huge number for the time. It preceded the modern <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>version</b> by two years and the Romanian translation by twenty. A second edition was published in 1858 in Athens, but as it had not been revised by any native speakers of Albanian it was full of errors.|$|E

500|$|Legend {{also has}} it that Marko {{acquired}} his strength after he was suckled by a vila. King Vukašin threw him into a river {{because he did not}} resemble him, but the boy was saved by a cowherd (who adopted him, and a vila suckled him). In other accounts, Marko was a shepherd (or cowherd) who found a vilas children lost in a mountain and shaded them against the sun (or gave them water). As a reward the vila suckled him three times, and he could lift and throw a large boulder. An Istrian [...] version has Marko making a shade for two snakes, instead of the children. In a <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>version,</b> each of the three draughts of milk he suckled from the vilas breast became a snake.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{validate}} Holland’s hexagonal and Tracey’s spherical model of vocational interests in young adults in Serbia and Bulgaria. To this end, 1250 participants, 560 from Serbia and 690 from Bulgaria, filled in Serbian and <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>versions</b> of the Personal Globe Inventory (PGI, Tracey, 2002). Hubert and Arabie’s randomization test of hypothetical orders, multidimensional scaling with fixed coordinates, Myors test and exploratory factor analysis were used. The results showed that the hexagonal and spherical models well explained the structure of vocational interests in both samples. The level of fit of the hexagonal model to the data obtained by using the PGI was generally higher than those established in the studies that used other Holland-based instruments. Furthermore, the levels of fit of both hexagonal and spherical model were in the same range like those obtained in previous studies in other countries. The results also pointed out a remarkable similarity in the structure of vocational interests in the Bulgarian and Serbian samples. [Projekat Ministarstva nauke Republike Srbije, br. 179002...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{explores the}} United Nations Convention {{on the rights}} of persons with disabilities (CRPD) from a phenomenological perspective. It argues for {{complementing}} the predominant juridical approach to the CRPD with attention to the extra-juridical dimension of the constitution of its meaning. The core argument is that disabled people's collectives should be recognised and admitted as important stakeholders and contributors in the community of interpretation that gives the CRPD its meaning. After briefly introducing the CRPD, {{the first part of the}} paper highlights the ubiquity of interpretation and the limits of its juridical regulation. The second part explores some extra-juridical factors that influence the interpretation of the CRPD. Two cases are considered: the socially embedded materiality of the interpretive work of the CRPD Committee; and the politics of interpretation inherent in the CRPD's translation between languages. The latter is backed up by comparing the English, French, Russian and <b>Bulgarian</b> <b>versions</b> of several CRPD provisions. In conclusion, some methodological and programmatic inferences are drawn from the analysis. In particular, it is argued that disabled people's civic self-organising is indispensable for sustaining the interpretation of the CRPD along transformative and emancipatory lines...|$|R

The two main versions of the distribution of the book are presented – without interpretations and with the interpretations of St. Andrew of Caesarea, while the specifics of the basic versions of the book are also presented (East Slavonic and South Slavic versions with commentaries, Bosnian Cyrillic version, the earliest Serbian transcript, Croatian Glagolitic fragments, <b>Bulgarian</b> calendar <b>version).</b> An opinion has been expressed that a common initial translation is at the root of all these versions of the book, which was accompanied by interpretations, and probably made in Bulgaria at the end of 9 th– 10 th C. Subsequently, it has been edited at different Times and in different locations, placed in the composition of different collections, or as a separate book...|$|R

5000|$|The {{decline of}} the Ottoman Empire from the mid-19th century coincided with Slavic {{resistance}} {{to the use of}} Greek in Orthodox churches and schools, and a resistance amongst some Macedonians to the introduction of standard Bulgarian in Vardar Macedonia. During the period of Bulgarian National Revival many Christians from Macedonia supported the struggle for creation of Bulgarian cultural, educational and religious institutions, including Bulgarian schools that used the version of Cyrillic adopted by other Bulgarians. The majority of the intellectual and political leaders of the Macedonian <b>Bulgarians</b> used this <b>version</b> of the Cyrillic script, which was also changed in the 19th and early 20th century.

40|$|This study {{reports on}} the {{development}} and cross-national utility of a Likert type scale measuring attitudes toward unauthorized migration into a foreign country in two samples from "migrant-sending" nations. In the first phase a pool of 86 attitude statements were administered {{to a sample of}} 505 undergraduate students in Bulgaria (22. 5 % male; M age = 23, SD = 4. 8). Exploratory factor analysis resulted in six factors, and a reduction to 34 items. The results yielded an overall alpha of (0. 92) and alpha for subscales ranging from 0. 70 to 0. 89. In the second phase the 34 -item scale was administered in a survey of 180 undergraduates from Sofia University in Bulgaria (16. 7 % male, M age = 23, SD = 4. 8), plus 150 undergraduates from Hanoi State University in Vietnam (14. 7 % male, M age = 19, SD = 1. 8). Results yielded a 19 -item scale with no gender differences, and satisfactory alpha coefficients for a Vietnamese and Bulgarian sample of 0. 87 and 0. 89 respectively. This scale, equally applicable in both samples, includes items that reflect salient topics of concept of attitudes towards unauthorized migration. An exploratory principal component analysis of the <b>Bulgarian</b> and Vietnamese <b>version</b> of the 19 -item scale yielded three factors accounting for 54 % and 47 % of the variance respectively. A procrustes analysis indicates high conceptual equivalence in the two samples for factor 1 and 2, and moderate for factor 3. This study lends support to the idea that despite different cultural meanings there is a common meaning space in culturally diverse societies. © 2008 The Scandinavian Psychological Associations...|$|R
