The mathematical model of hydrodynamic action {{in the process of}} the free abrasive wiresaw slicing was founded, displacement caused under distributed radial load of every node on the wire is embodimented through self-compliance influence coefficient, which is beneficial to found the film thickness equation. The distributions of hydrodynamic pressure and film thickness in the free abrasive wiresaw slicing process are yielded by using the finite difference numerical methods to solve the two-dimension Reynolds equation. The results show that the minimum film thickness increases with the increase of wire speed, and slurry viscosity, while decreases with the increase of <b>wire</b> <b>bow</b> angle.

Lucas van Tol, music supervisor and senior sound designer, provided the composers with a game design document, insisting on an intimate sound for the score. For the tribal theme, they experimented with <b>bows</b> on piano <b>wire</b> and resonator guitars (with layered tracks of harmonicas {{on top of the}} latter) and playing cellos with plectrums or the back of a bow to convey how contemporary instruments would be played by someone to whom the instruments were unknown; de Man also used a contrabass flute and made synth pads from blowing on a Thai bamboo flute, noting [...] "distant pads and ambiences, and wide, spread out chords seemed to work well". Circuit-bent synthesizers and percussive loops, run through impulse responses of metal and iron being beaten, were devoted to making a thematic identifier for the machines based on technology and metal. Van Tol required that the music be supplied in stems so that different pieces could be combined. The positive response to the first E3 trailer's main theme led it {{to be included in the}} main menu. The composers also did the motion capture for diegetic music vignettes, portraying in-game tribal musicians.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the solar modules are based on crystalline silicon (c-Si) wafers. Whereas the c-Si technology can offer a high efficiency, its main drawback (compared to traditional means to produce electricity) is the cost. The wafers account for {{one third of the}} total module cost, as high purity (thus expensive) silicon is required. One way to decrease the solar electricity cost is to decrease the amount of silicon needed for a wafer, for instance by sawing thinner wafers. Another way is to increase the solar cell production line yield by producing stronger wafers and hence reducing the breakage rate. From a technological point of view, both ways are equivalent, as thinner wafers have to be comparatively stronger to sustain the processing stresses. The core of this work is the analysis and understanding of the impact of wire-sawing parameters on the wafer’s mechanical properties with the aim of sawing thinner and stronger wafers. Wafer wire-sawing consists of a wire transporting a slurry, made of abrasive silicon carbide particles and lubricant, through a silicon brick. Such a process is complex, as it involves dynamic processes, fracture mechanics, fluid dynamics as well as tribological aspects on various length-scales. In {{the first part of the}} work, characterisation methods were developed to quantify the wafer quality: roughness, crack depth distribution, breakage stress, wafer thickness and Raman measurements were carried out. Furthermore, a TEM study was made to get a precise view of the silicon just below the wafer surface, and the surface at the top of the sawing groove was analysed to get a fundamental understanding of the material removal mechanisms. Two parametric studies were carried out to get insight into the influence of the sawing parameters on these wafer properties. The parameters that were studied were the abrasive size distribution, the slurry density, the wire tension and the feed rate. The first campaign focused on large parameter variations in order to have a global view of the variables determining wire-sawing, whereas the second campaign concentrated on lower variations and a more thorough study of these parameters closer to their standard values. From these data, mechanisms of crack creation are proposed and a novel semi-analytical model describing the wafer strength as a function of the sawing parameters is given. It is based on physical interactions and allows a deeper understanding of the sawing mechanisms. Furthermore, the effect of the sawing parameters on the wafer thickness is analysed. From these campaigns, it is seen that stronger wafers are obtained by using a fine abrasive, a low wire tension and a slow feed rate. A third study about the silicon debris impact on the wafer quality was carried out. It is found that below a given debris amount, they have no effect, but over this threshold, sawmarks appear and the wafer strength quickly decreases. This is put in relation with the findings from the two first sawing campaigns and a novel mechanism explaining the saw-mark creation is proposed: the debris prevents the abrasive particles from removing silicon as fast as required by the feed rate. This makes the wire pressure on the particle increase, until a second material removal mechanism appear. This mechanism is faster than the usual one and allow the <b>wire</b> <b>bow</b> (as well as the pressure on the particles) to decrease so that the sawing proceeds in fits and stops. From all the analysis done, a better general picture of the sawing process was gained. Differences between the top and the side of the sawing groove are explained, as well as differences between the wire entrance and exit side of the ingot. At the top of the groove, the roughness is lower and presents more facets and sharp angles than at the side (which is also the wafer surface). This is explained by a faster material removal rate at the top of the groove and by a lower maximal pressure on the particles. At the side, the particles can apply large pressure on the silicon when there is not enough room for the wire and several large particles overtaking each other. On the other hand, the slow material removal rate at the groove side leaves the smaller particles enough time to smooth the angles. The particles are progressively ejected from the groove side, which accounts for a roughness diminution and a wafer thickness increase in the first half of the wafer length. In the second half of the wafer length, the roughness is constant but the thickness still increases, indicating that the abrasive particle volume fraction in the slurry diminishes, without a notable change in particle size. Finally, near the wafer edges, the wire vibrations outside the silicon also account for a thickness deacrease. In the last part, diamond-wire wafering was studied as an alternative to the standard slurry sawing. The wafer surface characteristics were analysed and compared with slurrysawn wafers. On the diamond-wire sawn wafer, a thick layer of amorphous silicon was found. It has repercussions on topography, as smooth grooves are forming the surface, but also on the internal stress near the wafer surface: large stress has been measured by Raman spectroscopy and by EBSD, over 1 GPa. By applying the conclusions from this work, it is possible to saw thin and strong wafers. This study brings a better understanding of the material removal process at the micrometer level, helping the optimisation of the sawing. Furthermore, the developped semi-analytical model giving the impact of the sawing parameters on the wafer strength is a useful tool for producing stronger wafers. Finally, the presented study on diamond-wire sawn wafers brings relevant insights into the challenges that have to be faced before this technology can be successfully used by the industry...|$|R
40|$|Although {{at least}} thirty-five women {{were buried in}} the earlier {{necropolis}} at Vron during the period between ca. 370 / 75 and ca. 435 / 45, only {{three of them were}} equipped with typically Germanic brooches or other elements of dress. Such a low proportion of women whose dress was secured according to the Germanic custom by means of brooches, is not unusual in the burial sites of Northern Gaul, and indeed clearly distinguishes these from the burial grounds on the right bank of the Rhine in free Germania, where practically all the women used one or more brooches to fasten their clothing, and were subsequently buried with them. The evidence from Vron, as from other comparable military burial sites {{to the west of the}} Rhine (e. g. Oudenburg, Vermand, Vireux-Molhain), attesting how few women were buried with brooch jewellery, may indicate either that in actual fact very few Germanic women had accompanied their men-folk into Northern Gaul, or that the majority of women of barbaric origin had, in the process of cultural assimilation, abandoned their exotic costume at a very early date and now favoured Gallo-Roman dress. Among the typically Germanic dress ornaments observed at Vron, one may distinguish five different brooch types and one hairpin type, analysed below : 1. Simple cross-bow brooches belong to the most frequently attested and geographically widespread group of Germanic women’s brooches in the 4 th and 5 th centuries (mid- 4 th to mid- 5 th centuries) between the Elbe and the Loire (fig. 2). They are almost invariably made of bronze, as are the two examples from Grave 163 A and Pit 9. The brooch from Grave 163 A, worn as a single item, is remarkable for its greater length, its short spring, and upper chord. These rather unusual features appear most frequently in the simple cross-bow brooches from the Lower Rhine and Westphalia. There, this unusual form may be dated chiefly to the first half of the 5 th century. This corresponds to the chronology proposed by Cl. Seillier, who attributes, on other evidence, Grave 163 A to his Phase 3 (= ca. 415 / 20 - 435 / 45). 2. Cross-bow brooches with a trapezoid foot-plate represent a further typological development of the simple cross-bow brooch. The silver brooch from Grave 242 A possesses in addition a beaded wire decoration on the bow, together with a stamped metal plaque covering the trapezoid foot-plate, features which enable it to be classed with the Vert-la-Gravelle variant (fig. 3). This form of brooch, known almost exclusively by the archaeological evidence from the left bank of the Rhine is probably to be interpreted as the product of workshops in Northern Gaul, which are known to have manufactured other types of Germanic costume ornaments for the wives of foederati (see below). Comparison with the very similar brooches from Grave 7 at Vert-la-Gravelle (Mame) enable this example from Vron to be dated at the earliest to the last third of the 4 th century or to the turn of the century. The location of the inhumation within the burial ground suggests a date within Seillier’s Phase 2 (= ca. 390 - 415 / 20). 3. The bronze hairpin from the same grave, over 17 cm long, with a small round head, belongs to the Fecamp type (fig. 4), known chiefly from the Germanic female burials and other archaeological evidence found in Westphalia and the Lower Rhine. Presumably this heavy bronze hair-pin was used to secure a large headdress on the right side of the head, as in the depiction of the so-called Ubier costume found on Roman stelae. These accessories, which it would be better to refer to as head-dress pins, seem to have been a characteristic feature of the Frankish women’s costume, as, unlike numerous brooch types, they are not found in the graves of Saxon women. The fact that Fecamp type head-dress pins appear regularly in the graves of Germanic women who secured their clothing with a combination of tutulus and cross-bow brooches (see below) suggests they may be dated to the last third of the 4 th century and the beginning of the 5 th. 4. Tutulus brooches developed in the course of the 4 th century from an earlier type of brooch current in the 3 rd century to the east of the Rhine, and from the mid- 4 th century on represented the most frequently attested and most striking form of Germanic brooch between the Elbe and the Loire (fig. 5). Tutulus brooches were invariably worn in pairs at shoulder level to secure the peplos. They generally consisted of two thin silver coneor trumpet-shaped plaques, between which was set a large amber bead. The various parts were held together by an iron or bronze peg. In the course of the 4 th and early 5 th centuries the tutulus brooch developed ever larger forms, to which was eventually added a small terminal disc (fig. 6) with a niello pattern that suggest that the type originated in the workshops of Northern Gaul. The pair of brooches from Grave 269 A belongs in size and shape to the Cortrat-Oudenburg type, the majority of which can be dated to the late 4 th or early 5 th centuries. 5. In the graves of Northern Gaul as in those of Gennania east of the Rhine, tutulus brooches were fairly regularly found in association with cross-bow brooches (fig. 8). To the West of the Rhine, the majority of Germanic women wore two similar but rarely identical brooches, generally of bronze (Gaulish type B), occasionally silver (Gaulish type A). The two different brooches from Grave 269 A belong unequivocally to Gaulish type B and are decorated on the bow with niello fir twig patterns. Like the tutulus brooches, they may be dated to the late 4 th and early 5 th centuries. 6. The large cross-bow brooch from Grave 269 A (fig. 7) is unique in the whole region between the Lower Elbe and the Loire, which means that any typological and chronological classification is bound to be based exclusively on the analysis of particular formal details. This splendid brooch must be regarded as a unique, specially made creation which was of particular value to its wearer. a) The unusual system used to reinforce and stabilise an extremely long spring is part of a long tradition going back to the 3 rd century in the Germanic area (Westphalia, Lower Saxony, the region of the Elbe, Scandinavia). As this example from Vron shows, the tradition of using excessively long springs was apparently far from being forgotten even in the late 4 th century. b) The ornamental application of a disc on the bow or a beaded wire cuff is a technique used among the Germanic peoples of the Elbe and in Scandinavia from the late 3 rd century. Further west, these techniques seem to have still been in use among Germanic silversmiths in the late 4 th century, as one of the three cross-bow brooches with trapezoid foot-plate from Grave 7 at Vert-la-Gravelle proves. c) The elongated rhomboid foot-plate is a not unusual feature of the brooches of the Elbe Germans and in Southern Scandinavia in the late 3 rd and 4 th centuries. The peculiar form of the foot-plate may thus be interpreted as a legacy from the Elbe Germans. d) The ornamental use of small blue glass beads or larger blue glass stones inlaid in stamped sheet silver plaques is widely attested from the 2 nd to the 4 th century among numerous Germanic tribes (Southern Scandinavia, the region of the Elbe, Bohemia) and seems to have spread in the 4 th and 5 th centuries between the Elbe and the Seine. It is found not only in the mountings of late-Roman military belts at this period (especially buckles of the Misery type) but also in various brooch types, and may thus be considered as a commonly used decorative technique in Northern Gaul also. e) On the stamped silver plaque that covers the elongated foot-plate, on either side of the blue glass bead, one may recognise a stylised animal head, full-face (eyes, pricked up ears, clearly delineated muzzle). Such simplified animal heads are occasionally found on discoid brooches with stamped metal overlay of the Perlberg and Mahndorf type from the right bank of the Rhine. However, almost identical with the Vron motif is the animal head that appears on the stamped silver plaque of the two cross-bow brooches from Grave 7 at Vert-la-Gravelle. Because of the poor state of preservation of the artefact, this head had been wrongly interpreted hitherto as a vase motif. Thus metal plaques stamped with animal motifs originating in the region between the Lower Elbe and the Seine are much more common than was previously believed and belong to the familiar and widespread repertoire of the craftsmen working there. Taking into account all the details of the exceptionally magnificent brooch from Vron, one may establish that, even if certain ornamental details (disc on the <b>bow,</b> beaded <b>wire,</b> elongated foot-plate with stamped metal overlay) occur widely over a region stretching from the Elbe to Southern Scandinavia, and had their beginnings in the late 3 rd century, we may observe other features hitherto associated exclusively with Germanic brooches from west of the Lower Elbe. For this reason, one need no longer interpret this unusual brooch as a product from Northern Europe as was suggested some years ago. All things considered, one should rather assume the brooch originated in the region between the Elbe and the Seine, which would suggest the workshop in Belgica II. In the 4 th century and even up until the middle of the 5 th, Germanic women living in their homeland to the East of the Rhine wore a costume consisting of several garments, including a peplos and a shoulder cape or cloak, secured by brooches. The position of these brooches within the graves (fig. 9) suggests that the peplos dress was always held in place at shoulder level by two tutulus brooches, while one or two other brooches (in Northern Gaul a majority of cross-bow brooches with trapezoid foot) fastened the cloak or cape at the breast. Gallo-Roman women, on the other hand, wore a tunic that required no brooches. Of course, the proportion of Germanic women|$|R
