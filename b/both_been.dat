5000|$|In {{regard to}} whether two given propositions {{can have the}} same truth value, there are four {{separate}} logical possibilities: the propositions <b>are</b> subalterns (possibly <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true, and possibly <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false); subcontraries (it <b>is</b> possible that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true, but not that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false); contraries (it <b>is</b> possible that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false, but not that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true); or contradictories (it is not possible that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> true, {{and it is not}} possible that <b>both</b> <b>are</b> false).|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{square of}} opposition demonstrates {{two sets of}} contradictories A and O, and E and I (i.e. they cannot <b>both</b> <b>be</b> true and cannot <b>both</b> <b>be</b> false), two contraries A and E (i.e. they can <b>both</b> <b>be</b> false, but cannot <b>both</b> <b>be</b> true), and two subcontraries I and O (i.e. they can <b>both</b> <b>be</b> true, but cannot <b>both</b> <b>be</b> false) according to Aristotle’s definitions.

5|$|A {{large part}} of the team's support base {{consists}} of fans of Hajduk Split and Dinamo Zagreb, the two best-supported clubs in the Croatian domestic league, the Prva HNL. The clubs' ultra-style supporter groups, the Bad Blue Boys of Zagreb and The Torcida from Split, have <b>both</b> <b>been</b> associated with hooliganism, though violence between the two groups does not usually occur at international games. Heavy support for the Croatian national team also comes from Croats in Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly from fans of Zrinjski Mostar. The official Croatia supporters' club endorsed by the Croatian Football Federation is called Uvijek Vjerni (Always Faithful).|$|E
5|$|According to a 2007 article, the mite Varroa {{destructor}} {{remains the}} world's most destructive honey bee killer, {{due in part}} to the viruses it carries, including deformed wing virus and acute bee paralysis virus, which have <b>both</b> <b>been</b> implicated in CCD. Affliction with Varroa mites also tends to weaken the immune system of the bees. Dr. Enesto Guzman, an entomological researcher at the University of Guelph in Canada, studied 413 Ontario bee colonies in 2007–08. The presence of Varroa mites within colonies before winter was observed to weaken the immune systems of bees and introduce viruses that led to colony death during the winter. About 27% of hives did not survive the winter, and the Varroa mite was identified as the cause in 85% of the cases. Varroa mites also affect the queen's ability to reproduce, which is detrimental to the survival of the hive. As such, Varroa mites have been considered as a possible cause of CCD, though not all dying colonies contain these mites.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{research}} complied by meteorologist and tornado expert Thomas P. Grazulis, the New Richmond Tornado was the first determined F/EF5 in American history to cause a death toll exceeding 100, as the rating for the Natchez tornado has never been officially determined and the St. Louis-East St. Louis tornado ranked as only an F/EF4. In addition, the Amite-Purvis, 1908 Dixie tornado outbreak and Gainesville, 1936 Tupelo–Gainesville tornado outbreak tornadoes have also <b>both</b> <b>been</b> classified as only F/EF4 tornadoes, making the New Richmond Tornado the fifth deadliest F/EF5 in American history.|$|E

60|$|It {{is also to}} be observed, that {{towards the}} end of Charles II.'s reign, the High Churchmen and the Catholics {{regarded}} themselves as on the same side in political questions, and not greatly divided in their temporal interests. <b>Both</b> <b>were</b> sufferers in the Plot, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> enemies of the sectaries, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> adherents of the Stuarts.|$|R
50|$|The {{temporary}} union between Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Georgy Zhukov {{was founded}} on their similar backgrounds, interests and weaknesses: <b>both</b> <b>were</b> peasants, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> ambitious, <b>both</b> <b>were</b> abused by Stalin, both feared the Stalinists, and both wanted to change these things. Khrushchev and Zhukov needed one another to eliminate their mutual enemies in the Soviet political elite.|$|R
5|$|As Minerve {{turned back}} towards the British convoy with the {{intention}} of cutting off the rearmost ships, Astell passed her more damaged companions to become the first ship in line. This left Windham, now at the rear, to face Minerve alone. Fortunately for Stewart, Minerve lost two topmasts as she turned to face his ship and had to pull away from the British to effect repairs. An hour and a half later, at 18:30, Bellone joined the action, attacking Windham directly. Victor supported Bellone and accompanied the flagship as she moved ahead to attack Ceylon and Astell. By 19:00, with Ceylon damaged so severely that she could no longer effectively sail or fight, third officer Tristam Fleming hauled the ship out of the battle line and ordered his crew to cease firing: Meriton and his second officer Thomas Oldham had <b>both</b> <b>been</b> seriously wounded by grape shot.|$|E

Schumacher and Marceau, who have <b>both</b> <b>been</b> expelled from the estate after a fight over Lisette, watch Octave and Christine in the greenhouse.

5|$|Bisley and Henley had <b>both</b> <b>been</b> {{previously}} used as venues {{during the}} 1908 Games. Bisley hosted {{most of the}} shooting events while Henley hosted the rowing competition. Henley continues to host the Royal Regatta, which started in 1839, and remains in use as of 2010 for global competition, including the Diamond Sculls event. The Harringay Arena was built in 1928 and staged sporting events until its demolition in 1958. Built in 1891, the Herne Hill Velodrome hosted track cycling. After falling into disrepair by 2011, a modernization plan was implemented to make extensive structural repairs to the site and install a new track surface {{so that it could}} used by British Cycling, the national sport governing body.|$|E
