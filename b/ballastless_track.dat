25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of traditional track structures is the heavy demand for maintenance, particularly surfacing (tamping) and lining {{to restore the}} desired track geometry and smoothness of vehicle running.

30|$|Continuously welded rails (CWRs) are an {{important}} technology in modern railway track structures. Nowadays, most new railways worldwide belong to super long continuously welded rail tracks. In addition, along with the rapid development of high-speed railways in recent years, new technologies in track structure {{have been widely used}} for <b>ballastless</b> <b>tracks,</b> large-sized welded turnouts, CWRs on long-span bridges, etc. As there is an additional longitudinal rail force caused by track-bridge interaction, it poses important challenges to preventing the expansion and breaking of CWRs, especially track buckling and breakage on long-span bridges which severely threat the track structures of high-speed railways based on <b>ballastless</b> <b>tracks</b> [1, 2, 3]. In high-temperature seasons, an excessively high longitudinal tension in rail bars may cause track buckling, lifting, rail-pad shifting, part damage and malfunction, etc. In low-temperature seasons, rail bars under an excessively high longitudinal tension are likely to cause track breakage. The accurate measurement of longitudinal rail stress and rail temperature is the key to scientific evaluation, management and maintenance of CWRs [4, 5].|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Creep {{will lead}} to {{increasing}} deflection of prestressed concrete girder, which may induce rails uneven, especially to <b>ballastless</b> <b>tracks</b> in high-speed railways. In this paper, two creep models, CEB-FIP 90 and ACI 209, were used in a finite element model to analyze influences of creep on simply supported prestressed concrete box girders which are used in high-speed railway in China. Sensitivity analysis was carried on towards curing age, secondary dead load, loading time and prestressing method on deformation of the girder. The results show creep should be controlled in engineering to ensure driving security...|$|R
25|$|These systems {{offer the}} {{advantage}} of superior stability and almost complete absence of deformation. <b>Ballastless</b> <b>track</b> systems incur significantly lower maintenance costs compared to ballasted track. Due {{to the absence of}} any ballast, damage by flying ballast is eliminated, something that occurs at speeds in excess of 250km/h (150mph). It is also useful in renovating existing railroad tunnels. Because slab track allows shallower construction than ballasted track, it may provide the extra overhead clearance necessary for converting a line to overhead electrification, or allow the passage of trains with a greater loading gauge.|$|E

A review of other LCC researches has been done analysing their results in order to adapt previous experimental tracks costs to the present study which is focused on construction and maintenance costs in Spain. Even though several ballastless systems are introduced and analysed in terms of costs, and environmental impacts; only four of them are deeply compared with ballasted tracks: Japanese Shinkansen, Rheda 2000, EDILON embedded rail system and LVT. The comparisons are established using ratios (ballastless/ballasted track costs) instead of total costs due to their lack of validation among countries and years. Furthermore, two case studies have been presented: one using 3 % as discount rate which favours ballastless choice and another using 6 % which in contrast, favours the traditional option.

2500|$|Conventional {{ballasted}} tunnel-track {{was ruled}} out {{owing to the}} difficulty of maintenance and lack of stability and precision. [...] The Sonneville International Corporation's track system was chosen based on reliability and cost-effectiveness based on good performance in Swiss tunnels and worldwide. The type of track used is known as Low Vibration Track (LVT). Like ballasted track the LVT is of the free floating type, held in place by gravity and friction. Reinforced concrete blocks of 100kg support the rails every 60cm and are held by 12mm thick closed cell polymer foam pads placed at the bottom of rubber boots. The latter separate the blocks' mass movements from the lean encasement concrete. <b>Ballastless</b> <b>track</b> provides extra overhead clearance necessary for the passage of larger trains. The corrugated rubber walls of the boots add a degree of isolation of horizontal wheel-rail vibrations, and are insulators of the track signal circuit in the humid tunnel environment. UIC60 (60kg/m) rails of 900A grade rest on [...] rail pads, which fit the RN/Sonneville bolted dual leaf-springs. The rails, LVT-blocks and their boots with pads were assembled outside the tunnel, in a fully automated process developed by the LVT inventor, Mr. Roger Sonneville. About 334,000 Sonneville blocks were made on the Sangatte site.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} meet the {{expected}} severe environment of future maintenance work such as labor shortages due to low birthrates and tendencies of avoiding dirty, dangerous and difficult work, JR East developed TC-type low-maintenance track with the aim of minimizing maintenance needed. Beginning with introduction to the Yamanote Line in 1997, the track has been laid on lines where relatively lightweight trains run. From 2006, areas where it is laid have been expanded to lines on which freight trains run, including the Tokaido Line, and currently it has been laid over more than 230 km. Railways outside Japan, those in developed countries in particular, mainly adopt <b>ballastless</b> <b>tracks</b> such as slab tracks and Rheda 2000 tracks when constructing new lines.

40|$|Soil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, Sept. 2010 - Special Issue {{in honour of}} Prof. Anestis Veletsos. PostprintThe use of <b>ballastless</b> slab <b>track</b> is {{significantly}} increasing in HST line technology. This development is due to some structural and operational advantages over ballasted track. In addition, floating slab tracks {{can be used to}} control ground-borne vibrations generated by surface and underground rail transportation systems. In this paper, a general and fully three dimensional multi-body-finite element-boundary element model is used to study vibrations due to train passage on ballast and non-ballast tracks. The vehicle is modelled as a multi-body system, the track, in both cases, using finite elements and the soil is represented using boundary elements. The three components of the load are considered; the quasi-static excitation (force generated by moving axle loads), the parametric excitation due to discrete supports of the rails and the excitation due to wheel and rail roughness and track unevenness. Track receptances are computed for both track systems and vibrations induced by high-speed train passage at the track and the free-field are evaluated for different train speeds. Soil behaviour changes significantly with the track system. Finally, a floating slab track is studied to show how this type of solution leads to a significant vibration reduction for surface tracks.

40|$|In {{the last}} 40 years an {{increase}} in train speed and axle load {{around the world and}} other challenges in the conventional ballasted track system gave birth to <b>ballastless</b> railway <b>track</b> system. This study examines in depth the various slab track systems that are being used today. Their design characteristics as well as the various requirements for efficient use are thoroughly explained. At least 34 different ballastless systems have been recorded in many railway networks throughout the world. The most significant slab track systems are analysed in detail and compared. Slab track designs have significant advantages comparing to ballasted tracks. The most significant are the high stability of the track, the almost non-existent need for maintenance, the long life cycle (60 years) and the reduced weight and height of the track. Their disadvantages against the ballasted tracks are mainly summarized in their higher construction costs. The Finite Element package ABAQUS/CAE is used to model a 3 -D slab track design under static traffic loading. The results suggest that slab tracks have profoundly better stability and durability comparing to ballasted tracks mainly due to their higher stiffness and strength.
