5000|$|Acquisition of dive {{equipment}} {{is done in}} phases {{over an extended period}} of time and is subject to considerable <b>budgetary</b> <b>constraint.</b> A fully compliant DIR based system costs more than a simple recreational setup, meaning that moving through the phases of kit acquisition focused on DIR approval leads to having less personally owned equipment for much of the acquisition period. It has been argued that the lack of necessity to purchase a dive computer reduces DIR costs(Jablonski: [...] "Dive computers are expensive, and prevent divers with limited resources from purchasing truly useful equipment" [...] "), it has also been argued that the lack of a dive computer adds to the risk of diving for recreational divers. Recreational dive equipment manufacturers provide equipment designed to provide a wide range of costs and performance characteristics in equipment, targeted at the range of uses and demands that recreational divers transition through as they acquire kit.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we propose}} a {{flexible}} framework to assess Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) context. We address the substantive and modeling challenges {{that arise in}} this setting, namely (a) multiple-discreteness, (b) brand-switching, and (c) budget constrained consumption. Using a Bayesian estimation, we are also able to infer the consumer’s latent <b>budgetary</b> <b>constraint</b> using only transaction information, thus enabling managers to understand the customer’s <b>budgetary</b> <b>constraint</b> without having to survey or depend on aggregate measures of budget constraints. Using the proposed framework, CPG manufacturers can assess CLV at the focal brand-level {{as well as at}} the category-level, a departure from CLV literature which has mostly been firm-centric. We implement the proposed model on panel data in the carbonated beverages category and showcase the benefits of the proposed model over simpler heuristics as well as conventional CLV approaches. Finally, we conduct two policy simulations describing the role of the budget constraint on CLV as well as the asymmetric effects of pricing in this setting and develop managerial insights in this context...|$|E

30|$|Given that {{armed forces}} are often used to {{maintain}} internal law and order, internal security determinants such as civil war, insurgencies, civil strife often affect the levels of such spending. To this, one may also add the political inclinations of the incumbent government and hence its defence and broader policy traits (inter alia: Kauder and Potrafke 2016; Albalate et al. 2012; Bove and Nisticò 2014; Yildirim and Sezgin 2005). Clearly, the inevitable <b>budgetary</b> <b>constraint</b> that influences the level of public expenditures, also affects the annual defence budget and the resources allocated to the military (Christie 2017).|$|E
