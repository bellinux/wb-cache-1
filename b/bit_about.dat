25|$|The {{inscription}} {{mentions that}} Dhanga's descendant Jayavarman had it re-written in clear letters in 1173 VS. It states that Dhanga constructed a magnificent Shiva temple with two lingas (symbols of Shiva). One linga – Marakateshvara ("Emerald Lord") – {{was made of}} emerald. The other linga – Pramathanatha ("Lord of Pramathas or goblin-like spirits") – was made of stone. The inscription {{appears to have been}} issued after Dhanga's death: it states that after living for more than a hundred years, Dhanga attained moksha by abandoning his body in the waters of Ganga and Yamuna. Unlike some other Chandela temple inscriptions, it does not mention the Pratihara overlords of the Chandelas. This suggests that the Chandelas were no longer vassals of the Pratiharas by this time. The <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the emerald linga (possibly an emerald-studded linga) also supports this theory. According to the Puranas, a jewel-studded linga is an appropriate donation to be made upon the fulfilment of a desire. This suggests that Dhanga built the temple after attaining a high political status as a sovereign.|$|E

500|$|However, Hergé knew {{as little}} about China {{as he did}} about the Soviet Union or the Belgian Congo. At the time most Belgians held to a {{negative}} stereotype of China, viewing it as [...] "a distant continent of a nation, barbaric, overpopulated, and inscrutable", and Hergé had long believed this view. He had included Chinese characters in two previous Adventures, in both instances depicting them according to traditional European clichés. In Tintin in the Land of the Soviets, he included two pigtailed Chinese men hired by the Bolsheviks to torture Tintin, while in Tintin in America he featured two Chinese hoodlums who plotted to eat Snowy. Hergé learned a <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the country from Albert Londres' book China Madness, based on Londres' experiences in the country. He was also influenced in his portrayal of China by the 1933 German film Flüchtlinge (At the End of the World).|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Party" [...] was {{directed}} by Beyoncé and Alan Ferguson.

Solange Knowles, Beyoncé's younger sister, and Kelly Rowland, former Destiny's Child member, both made cameos.

40|$|The {{function}} of the primate hippocampus and related structures was analysed by making recordings from the hippocampus, subiculum, presubiculum, and parahippocampal gyrus in monkeys actively walking in the laboratory. Head direction cells {{were found in the}} presubiculum. The firing rate of these cells was a {{function of}} the head direction of the monkey, with a response that was typically 10 [...] 100 times larger to the best as compared to the opposite direction. The mean half-amplitude width of the tuning of the cells was 76. The response of head direction cells in the presubiculum was not influenced by the place where the monkey was, there being the same tuning to head direction at different places in a room, and even outside the room. The response of these cells was also independent of the "spatial view" observed by the monkey, and also the position of the eyes in the head. The average information about head direction was 0. 64 <b>bits,</b> <b>about</b> place was 0. 10 <b>bits,</b> <b>about</b> spatial view was 0. 27 <b>bits,</b> and <b>about</b> eye position was 0. 04 bits.

In spite of the album's success, Miguel did not want to release a follow-up record that was similar to Romance.

500|$|Around 1895, {{football}} {{was introduced in}} the Philippines by English sportsmen. [...] In addition, some Filipinos sent to college in Hong Kong and China returned home and taught their friends a little <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> the game of football. [...] Within a year, there were two or three football clubs established in Manila. In 1898, the U.S. Navy battleship Maine was anchored in Havana harbor to protect the Americans from a riot between Cuba and Spanish officers, and after the ship sank resulting in significant casualties, the Americans declared war against Spain, beginning the Spanish–American War. They damaged every ship in Manila Bay, This ended Spanish colonization of the Philippines, and replaced the colonizing Spaniards with Americans. When the war broke out, those football teams disbanded and abandoned the city, either to save themselves and their families from the bombardment they expected at any moment, or to cast their lot with the Filipino troops outside the city limits. After the war when peace reigned again, six football teams were formed, among them the Manila Sporting Club, the Paris Club, and the Manila Jockey Club. In 1906, the Sandow football team was established (further developed as Sandow Athletic Club in 1909).|$|E

[...] A reviewer from Sify.com found the film's depiction of fashion industry [...] "superficial"; noting that the film does {{not talk about the}} clothing, the creativity, or the passion for work in the fashion industry. However, according to Bhandarkar the film was [...] "not about [...] fashion industry as such. It only has fashion as a backdrop. The film is more about the story of models, designers and people.

[...] Critics also {{said that the}} film explores drug abuse, homosexuality and gay relationships. Designer Vineet Bahl complained about the male characters, most of whom are portrayed as [...] "gay designers and exploitative agency owners".

500|$|The {{idea for}} The Lion King was {{conceived}} in late 1988 during {{a conversation between}} Jeffrey Katzenberg, Roy E. Disney and Peter Schneider {{on a plane to}} Europe to promote Oliver & Company. During the conversation, the topic of a story set in Africa came up, and Katzenberg immediately jumped at the idea. The idea was then developed by Walt Disney Feature Animation's vice president for creative affairs Charlie Fink. Katzenberg decided to add elements involving coming of age and death, and ideas from personal life experiences, such as some of his trials in his bumpy road in politics, saying about the film, [...] "It is a little <b>bit</b> <b>about</b> myself." [...] In November of that year Thomas Disch (author of The Brave Little Toaster) wrote a treatment entitled King of the Kalahari, and afterwards, Linda Woolverton spent a year writing drafts of the script, which was titled King of the Beasts and then King of the Jungle. The original version of the film was very different from the final film. The plot was centered in a battle being between lions and baboons with Scar being the leader of the baboons, Rafiki being a cheetah, and Timon and Pumbaa being Simba's childhood friends. Simba would also not leave the kingdom but become a [...] "lazy, slovenly, horrible character" [...] due to manipulations from Scar, so Simba could be overthrown after coming of age. By 1990, producer Thomas Schumacher, who had just completed The Rescuers Down Under, decided to attach himself to the project [...] "because lions are cool". Schumacher likened the script for King of the Jungle to [...] "an animated National Geographic special".|$|E
