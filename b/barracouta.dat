5|$|Following {{the orders}} of {{the captain of the}} <b>Barracouta,</b> Waddell {{immediately}} converted the warship back to a merchant ship, storing her cannon below, discharging all arms, and repainting the hull. At this point, Waddell decided to sail back to England and surrender the Shenandoah in Liverpool. Surrendering in an American port carried the certainty of facing a court with a Union point of view and the very real risk of a trial for piracy, for which he and the crew could be hanged. Sailing south around Cape Horn and staying well off shore to avoid shipping that might report Shenandoah's position, they saw no land for another 9,000 miles until they arrived back in England, having logged a total of over 58,000 miles around the world in a year's travel—the only Confederate ship to circumnavigate the globe.|$|E

25|$|On August 3, 1865, Waddell finally {{learned of}} the war's end when he met at sea the Liverpool barque <b>Barracouta,</b> which was bound for San Francisco. He {{received}} the devastating news of the surrender of General Joseph E.

500|$|Waddell finally {{learned of}} Lee's {{surrender}} on June 27 when {{the captain of}} the prize Susan & Abigail produced a newspaper from San Francisco. [...] The same paper contained Confederate President Jefferson Davis's proclamation that the [...] "war would be carried on with re-newed vigor". Shenandoah proceeded to capture a further ten whalers in the following seven hours. [...] Wadell then steered Shenandoah south, intending to raid the port of San Francisco which he believed to be poorly defended. [...] En route they encountered an English barque, <b>Barracouta,</b> on August 2 from which Wadell learned of the final collapse of the Confederacy including the surrenders of Johnston's, Kirby Smith's, and Magruder's armies and the capture of President Davis. The long log entry of the Shenandoah for August 2, 1865, begins [...] "The darkest day of my life." [...] Captain Waddell realized then in his grief that they had taken innocent unarmed Union whaling ships as prizes {{when the rest of the}} country had ended hostilities.|$|E

2500|$|The Cherokee-class of 10-gun brig-sloops was {{designed}} by Sir Henry Peake in 1807, and eventually over 100 were constructed. The working drawings for HMS Beagle and HMS <b>Barracouta</b> were issued to the Woolwich Dockyard on 16 February 1817, and amended in coloured ink on 16 July 1817 with modifications to increase {{the height of the}} bulwarks (the sides of the ship extended above the upper deck) by an amount varying from [...] at the stem to [...] at the stern. The Beagles keel was laid in June 1818, construction cost £7,803, and the ship was launched on 11 May 1820. In July of that year she took part in a fleet review on the River Thames, celebrating the coronation of King George IV of the United Kingdom.|$|E
2500|$|While {{cruising}} off the Chinese coast, the Arrow incident occurred, {{the prelude}} to the Second Opium War, and the British decided to bombard the port of Canton. [...] Bate {{was put in charge}} of the landing parties, and whilst overseeing operations from HMS <b>Barracouta,</b> was struck on the hand by some shot, and was slightly wounded. After the subduing of resistance, Bate took over and garrisoned a fort with 300 men. He held the fort under siege for five months, before the Admiralty ordered him to evacuate. He returned to the Actaeon, then at Hong Kong. As a reward for his services, he was promoted to Captain. Bate returned to Canton in November 1857, and delivered Lord Elgin's ultimatum to the Chinese officials. There being no reply, the navy began to bombard the port on 28 December.|$|E
60|$|The guard-boat lay {{across the}} mouth of the bathing-pool, her crew idly spanking the water with the flat of their oars. A red-coated militia-man, rifle in hand, sat at the bows, and a petty officer at the stern. Between the snow-white cutter and the flat-topped, honey-coloured rocks on the beach the green water was troubled with shrimp-pink prisoners-of-war bathing. Behind their orderly tin camp and the electric-light poles rose those stone-dotted spurs that throw heat on Simonstown. Beneath them the little <b>Barracouta</b> nodded to the big Gibraltar, and the old Penelope, that in ten years has been bachelors' club, natural history museum, kindergarten, and prison, rooted and dug at her fixed moorings. Far out, a three-funnelled Atlantic {{transport}} with turtle bow and stern waddled in from the deep sea.|$|E
60|$|We rowed on {{past the}} Boca de Monos, {{by which we}} had entered the gulf at first, and looked out eagerly enough for sharks, which are said to swarm at Chaguaramas. But no warning fin {{appeared}} above the ripple; only, more than once, close to {{the stern of the}} boat, a heavy fish broke water with a sharp splash and swirl, which was said to be a <b>Barracouta,</b> following us up in mere bold curiosity, but perfectly ready to have attacked any one who fell overboard. These Barracoutas--Sphyraenas as the learned, or 'pike' as the sailors call them, though they are no kin to our pike at home--are, when large, nearly as dangerous as a shark. In some parts of the West Indies folk dare not bathe for fear of them; for they lie close inshore, amid the heaviest surf; and woe to any living thing which they come across. Moreover, they have this somewhat mean advantage over you, that while, if they eat you, you will agree with them perfectly, you cannot eat them, at least at certain or uncertain seasons of the year, without their disagreeing with you, without sickness, trembling pains in all joints, falling off of nails and hair for years to come, and possible death. Those who may wish to know more of the poisonous fishes of the West Indies may profitably consult a paper in the Proceedings of the Scientific Association of Trinidad by that admirable naturalist, and--let me say of him (though I have not the honour of knowing him) what has long been said by all who have that honour--admirable man, the Hon. Richard Hill of Jamaica. He mentions some thirteen species which are more or less poisonous, at all events at times: but on the cause of their unwholesomeness he throws little light; and still less on the extraordinary but undoubted fact that the same species may be poisonous in one island and harmless in another; and that of two species so close as to be often considered as the same, one may be poisonous, the other harmless. The yellow-billed sprat, {102} for instance, is usually so poisonous that 'death has occurred from eating it in many cases immediately, and in some recorded instances even before the fish was swallowed.' Yet a species caught with this, and only differing from it (if indeed it be distinct) by having a yellow spot instead of a black one on the gill-cover, is harmless. Mr. Hill attributes the poisonous quality, in many cases, to the foul food which the fish get from coral reefs, such as the Formigas bank, midway between Cuba, Hayti, and Jamaica, where, as you 'approach it from the east, you find the cheering blandness of the sea-breeze suddenly changing to the nauseating smell of a fish- market.' There, as off similar reefs in the Bahamas and round Anegada, as we'll as at one end of St. Kitts, the fish are said to be all poisonous. If this theory be correct, the absence of coral reefs round Trinidad may help to account for the fact stated by Mr. Joseph, that poisonous fish are unknown in that island. The statement, however, is somewhat too broadly made; for the Chouf- chouf, {103a} a prickly fish which blows itself out like a bladder, and which may be seen hanging in many a sailor's cottage in England, is as evil-disposed in Trinidad as elsewhere. The very vultures will not eat it; and while I was in the island a family of Coolies, in spite of warning, contrived to kill themselves with the nasty vermin: the only one who had wit enough to refuse it being an idiot boy.|$|E
