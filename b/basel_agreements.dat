At the same time, Britain floated the pound sterling. According to Chancellor of the Exchequer Anthony Barber, this was to halt a recent increase in capital outflow to other parts of the sterling area.|$|E

40|$|A well {{functioning}} banking {{sector is}} crucial to the functioning of our financial system, but yet the banking sector has been very troubled by different crises during the last 20 years. Even though more stringent rules and requirements develop through increasingly stringent <b>Basel</b> <b>agreements</b> the global financial crisis of 2008 show that it still exist a problem of financial risk management. Further several financial organizations have run into financial problem because of failures in internal control and monitoring systems. Therefore it is worth highlighting the question of centralization or decentralization since this is a factor that affects the control an organization has. Based on this background we believe {{that it is important to}} investigate the effect these variables have on financial risk management.   The purpose of this study therefore is to outline the relationship between the degree of centralization and the risk management structure at three major banks in Sweden. Further we want to show the effect more stringent rules and regulations, stemming from the <b>Basel</b> <b>agreements,</b> have on the degree of centralization in the banks risk management. Further we wish to increase the general knowledge of which of the risks facing the banks that are most likely to be managed at the different levels and contrast on the differences between the banks.   Our main concepts presented in the theoretical frame of reference are rules and regulations, which mainly consists of the <b>Basel</b> <b>agreements,</b> financial risk and financial risk management, where we presents the main financial risks a bank is exposed to and how these risks mainly are handled. Lastly the concept of organizational structure is presented, where our main focus is on the concept of centralization/decentralization. From the above-mentioned concepts a semi-structured interview guide was deducted, which we used to gather our empirical data. Our main focus was to highlight the problem from the banks point of view and therefore the questions mainly focused on the effects for the banks and not for their customers.   The data gathered from the interviews is presented in the three broad categories of risk, rules and regulation and lastly organizational structure. From the empirical findings and analysis we could conclude that the banks seem to have similar risk management structures and the degree of centralization and the overall organizational structure do not seem to have a big impact on how the banks manage financial risks. Rather it is the nature of the risk that determines where in the hierarchy the risk is managed and how it is managed. Further the increasingly stringent rules and regulations contribute to increasing control functions, increased importance for central risk units and changes in risk management due to new methods for calculating risk exposures. Nevertheless the increasingly stringent rules and regulations do not affect where in the hierarchy business decisions are made...|$|E

40|$|Historically, much of {{the banking}} {{regulation}} that {{was put in place}} was designed to reduce systemic risk. In many countries capital regulation {{in the form of the}} <b>Basel</b> <b>agreements</b> is currently one of the most important measures to reduce systemic risk.

Another is that it represents regulatory arbitrage and the concentration of risk that may result from this could increase systemic risk.

The risks implied by the banking activity have a multiple determination, starting from the specific features of their own operations, to {{the features of the}} internal and external environment. Under the <b>Basel</b> <b>Agreement,</b> the operational risk is approached depending on the category of events in which it is included. The <b>Basel</b> II <b>Agreement</b> uses three measuring methods: a fixed percentage (15 %) of the average anual bank income (over the last three years), a variable percentage (between 12 and 18 %) of the gross bank income (corresponding to the category in which the bank is included) and a combined methos based on the validity of the bank income.

40|$|Research {{regarding}} the capital structure of banks {{points to the}} regulatory minimum capital requirement established by the <b>Basel</b> <b>agreements</b> as its main determinant. For other kinds of enterprise, capital structure is pointed to by several theories as a tax planning alternative, since the use of debt allows tax savings. Given the debt characteristics of banks, which prevent the deduction {{of interest in the}} calculation of income taxes and thus prevent tax savings through debt, the use of capital structure for tax planning by financial institutions is less evident. In view of this, in addition to contributing to research on the determinants of the capital structure of banks, this study has the objective of examining the relationship between overall debt, taxation and the BIS ratio of financial institutions located in Brazil. The initial sample consisted of the 50 largest banks, identified by the criterion of net income in 2012; but due to lack of availability of information and adjustments made to assure the efficacy of the study, the final sample was made up of 34 financial institutions. The baseline for analysis was the mean values of data from 2010 to 2012 and data were analyzed using correlation analysis and multiple linear regression.
