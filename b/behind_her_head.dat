25|$|In 1997, Anita {{developed}} the Body Shop's most successful campaign ever, creating Ruby, the size 16 doll, who {{was thought to}} bear a passing resemblance to Barbie. The campaign evolved from a new strategic positioning developed by ethical communications consultancy Host Universal, who created {{the image of the}} naked red-haired doll, hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and wind in her hair, that became the embodiment of the campaign. The photographer was Steve Perry.|$|E
25|$|The Viennese oyster {{position}} requires great flexibility {{from the}} woman to perform. The female lies {{on her back and}} moves her legs <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> with the groin area being completely exposed. The male partner penetrates the vagina from the top. This is a deep penetrating position and may not be suitable for men with larger than average penis size. However, in most cases, the female will not be flexible enough to achieve this position fully, and will need to stop well before the legs are behind the head. If that is the case, the male partner can help hold the legs in a comfortable position and continue on with intercourse.|$|E
25|$|One {{possible}} scenario on how direct insemination {{evolved in}} insects {{is seen in}} scorpions. The male deposits a spermatophore on the ground, locks its claws with the female's claws and then guides her over his packet of sperm, making sure it comes in contact with her genital opening. When the early (male) insects laid their spermatophores on the ground, {{it seems likely that}} some of them used the clasping organs {{at the end of their}} body to drag the female over the package. The ancestors of Odonata evolved the habit of grabbing the female <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> as they still do today. This action, rather than not grasping the female at all, would have increased the male's chances of spreading its genes. The chances would be further increased if they first attached their spermatophore safely on their own abdomen before they placed their abdominal claspers behind the female's head; the male would then not let the female go before her abdomen had made direct contact with his sperm storage, allowing the transfer of all sperm.|$|E
60|$|He {{struck a}} note, and Anna responded. Playing {{with one hand}} he turned on his stool to glance at her. Instinctively she {{had fallen into the}} posture of the poster, <b>her</b> hands <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> bent {{slightly}} forward, her chin uplifted, her eyes bright with the drollery of the song. Mr. Earles closed the piano with a little bang.|$|R
60|$|So {{our little}} {{procession}} was re-formed. Mabane, and Arthur {{with his hands}} deep {{in his pockets and}} an angry frown upon his forehead, walked on ahead. Behind came Isobel and I--Isobel with <b>her</b> hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> a little thrown back, a faint, wistful smile lightening the unusual gravity of her face. I looked at her in wonder.|$|R
50|$|The Coat of Arms of Nowy Targ, {{a town in}} {{southern}} Poland, shows a woman (Saint Catherine of Alexandria) dressed in white with a red cape with white dots, wearing a crown and holding a sword at her side. She holds a large green olive leaf, {{and there is a}} yellow wheel <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b> <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> is encircled by a halo, indicating her sainthood.|$|R
2500|$|Selene is {{commonly}} depicted with a crescent moon, {{often accompanied by}} stars; sometimes, instead of a crescent, a lunar disc is used. Often a crescent moon rests on her brow, or the cusps of a crescent moon protrude, horn-like, from her head, or from <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> or shoulders. [...] Selene's head is sometimes surrounded by a nimbus, and from the Hellenistic period onwards, she is sometimes pictured with a torch.|$|E
2500|$|Russell's {{measurements}} were 38D-24-36, {{and she stood}} 5ft 7 in (97-61-91cm and 1.7 m), making her more statuesque than most of her contemporaries. Her favorite co-star Bob Hope once introduced her as [...] "the two and only Jane Russell". He joked, [...] "Culture {{is the ability to}} describe Jane Russell without moving your hands." [...] Howard Hughes said, [...] "There are two good reasons why men go to see her. Those are enough." [...] A publicity still for the movie showed her lying on a pile of straw, her blouse stretched tight across her voluptuous breasts. Her right hand was <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> of black hair and her left hand held a revolver. The image was a popular pin-up photo with servicemen during World War II. She did not appear in another movie until 1946, when she played Joan Kenwood in Young Widow for RKO.|$|E
60|$|Lady Peggy {{reached out}} for a cushion and placed it <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|I {{bent forward}} {{and looked into}} her face. There was in her {{wonderful}} eyes a glint of laughter which became her well. She walked with slow graceful ease, <b>her</b> hands <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> almost on a level with my own. I found myself studying her with a new pleasure. Then our eyes met, and I looked away, momentarily confused. Was it my fancy, or was there a certain measure of rebuke in her cool surprise, a faint indication of her desire that I should remember {{that she was the}} Lady Angela Harberly, and I her father's secretary? I bit my lip. She should not catch me offending again, I determined.|$|R
60|$|Knowing {{this to be}} a fiction, Mrs. Goodman made no remark, {{and hearing}} a slight noise <b>behind,</b> turned <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Seeing <b>her</b> aunt's action, Paula also looked round. The door had been left ajar, and De Stancy was {{standing}} in the room. The last words of Mrs. Goodman, and Paula's reply, must have been quite audible to him.|$|R
6000|$|But afterward, {{when they}} had adjourned to a suite that had now been given them, and which {{included}} a cosy little sitting room, and after the Colonel had been ordered to light his cigar, which always composed his nerves, the O'Gorman girl suddenly turned serious and {{from the depths of}} an easy chair, with <b>her</b> hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> red <b>head,</b> she said: ...|$|R
60|$|Stephanie {{threw herself}} {{back in her}} easy-chair and clasped her hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|Edith {{clasped her}} hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and looked fixedly {{up at the}} blue sky.|$|E
60|$|Cleopatra {{placed her}} hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and, leaning back, {{looked at me}} with half-shut eyes.|$|E
60|$|Before {{she reached}} the grounds the storm came. There was a crash of thunder, which seemed to tear apart the heavens above, and then the big raindrops began to fall upon her bare {{shoulders}} and her clothes as light and airy as butterfly's wings. She abandoned herself to the ruin of a Paquin gown without a thought of regret; she even laughed softly with pleasure as she lifted her burning face to the cool sweet deluge, and lessened her pace in the avenue, walking with <b>her</b> hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> still upraised. It was a wonderful night, this. She had found something of her lost girlhood.|$|R
60|$|Margaret did {{not notice}} at first. She was too deeply absorbed in her own {{troubles}} to think that {{anyone else in the}} world could be miserable too. She curled up in the deep easy-chair by the fire, and clasped <b>her</b> hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> curly <b>head</b> with a sigh of physical comfort and mental unhappiness, while Aunt Beatrice, warily sitting {{with her back to the}} light, took up her work again.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{the wife}} of Talaloo heard a faint hiss <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b> Turning <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> she saw <b>her</b> former husband in the bushes. He beckoned to her, and dis{{appeared}}. None {{of the other women}} appeared to have heard or observed the man. Presently, Talaloo's wife rose, and going into the woods, joined her husband. She found him in company with Timoa.|$|R
60|$|He stopped {{because his}} wife had clasped again her hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and was no longer looking at him.|$|E
60|$|She {{turned away}} and sat in a low chair, her hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> her eyes fixed upon vacancy.|$|E
60|$|But she was interrupted. With {{an angry}} spurt, a bullet {{embedded}} {{itself in the}} upholstery of the car just <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
60|$|He didn't overdo it. He took {{leave in}} ten minutes--to find good {{influences}} in a Kelly pool-parlor on Third Avenue. He {{returned to his}} room at ten, and, sitting with his shoeless feet cocked up on his bed, read a story in Racy Yarns. While beyond the partition, about four feet from him, Una Golden lay in bed, <b>her</b> smooth arms <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> aching <b>head,</b> and worried about Phil's lack of opportunity.|$|R
60|$|Kirstie, {{her eyes}} shining with unshed tears, {{stretched}} {{out her hand}} towards him appealingly; the bright and the dull gold of her hair flashed and smouldered in the coils <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> comely <b>head,</b> like the rays of an eternal youth; the pure colour had risen in her face; and Archie was abashed alike by her beauty and her story. He came towards her slowly from the window, took up {{her hand in his}} and kissed it.|$|R
6000|$|While {{still we}} sat in silence, another voice uttered a wail of {{infinite}} terror and despair. [...] "I didn't do it! Don't kill me! It was not my work." [...] And then, still more horrible to hear, a sound like the gurgling of blood came from the psychic's lips, mixed with babbled, frantic, incoherent words. I had a perfectly definite impression that she was impersonating some one with his throat cut. Her grimaces were disgusting and terrifying. The women shivered with horror. A few seconds later and her face changed; the hideous mask became white, expressing rigid, exalted terror. Her arms were drawn back as if tied at the elbow <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> back. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> was uplifted, and in a low, monotonous, hushed voice she prayed: [...] "Lord Jesus, receive--" ...|$|R
60|$|She {{was leaning}} back in her chair, her hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> a posture she often assumed. She {{looked up at me}} amusedly.|$|E
60|$|She seated {{herself on}} a stone bench facing a sun-dial, and leaning hack, her hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> {{looked at me and}} laughed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Eighteen." [...] She {{continued}} to watch him, unblinking, her arms <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> She had on Russian army pants and shirt. Gray-green. Thick leather belt with counter and cartridges. Medicine kit.|$|E
60|$|So {{intent was}} Eustacia upon Wildeve's {{fortunes}} that she forgot how {{much closer to}} her own course were those of Clym; and instead of walking on {{to meet him at}} once she sat down upon a stone. She was disturbed in her reverie by a voice <b>behind,</b> and turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> beheld the old lover and fortunate inheritor of wealth immediately beside her.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} I thought that her desire was another shilling, {{but by a}} piece of {{pantomime}} she showed that {{she wanted me to}} lift my hat to her. So I lifted it, and when I looked <b>behind</b> she had <b>her</b> <b>head</b> in the air and her neighbour was gazing at her awestruck. These little creatures are really not without merit.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned to}} watch him as he came along the aisle <b>behind</b> the boxes; <b>her</b> <b>head</b> still throbbed with the dying {{pulsations}} of the music. Everybody seemed to know and greet him with cordial readiness of hand. He came along easily, his handsome blonde face showing little more expression at meeting her than the others, yet {{when he saw her}} rapt and flushed face he was touched.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Merrick did not reply. She {{stitched}} {{away in a}} methodical manner, as if abstracted, and Louise {{crossed her}} delicate hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and gazed at her mother reflectively. Presently she said: ...|$|E
60|$|The model threw {{aside the}} paper {{she had been}} reading, La Petite Republique, and sulkily, {{throwing}} off her gown, got on to the stand. She stood, squarely on both feet with her hands clasped <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "I never {{pity the}} dead," [...] said Mrs. Jarvis, {{shifting}} the cushion at her back, and clasping her hands <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> Betty Flanders did not hear, for her scissors {{made so much}} noise on the table.|$|E
60|$|The ladies {{should all}} have kept their seats. Mrs. Woodward did do so. Linda jumped up, and being {{next to the}} barge, was pulled up into it {{by one of the}} men. Katie stood bolt upright, with the tiller-ropes still in her hand, awe-struck at the misfortune she had caused; but while she was so standing, the stern of the boat was lifted nearly out of the water by the weight of the barge, and Katie was pitched, <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> mother's back, <b>head</b> {{foremost}} into the water.|$|R
25|$|On New Year's Day 1972, Tutuila {{departed}} Vung Tau {{after six}} years of combat support duties. Many times she had hoisted PCFs or other patrol craft onto pontoons alongside for complete overhauls; her crew had taught their Vietnamese counterparts the intricacies of diesel power plants and generators. Her guns had even conducted one offensive shore bombardment. Vietnam lay <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> as she <b>headed</b> for Hong Kong on 1 January 1972. Six days of bad weather jostled her before she finally made port at the British Crown Colony on 7 January.|$|R
5000|$|One {{hallmark}} of Mishkutionok/Dmitriev's style was their creative spins, especially {{one in which}} Mishkutionok would do a split and point <b>her</b> <b>head</b> down, with an arm around Dmitriev's calf so that they were both vertical and aligned; this signature move, called [...] "Natasha's spin" [...] was incorporated into most of their programs. Another signature move was a backwards inside death spiral in which Mishkutionok bent backwards, holding <b>her</b> foot <b>behind</b> and above <b>her</b> <b>head</b> while Dmitriev also held her raised skate blade and her free hand. Mishkutionok/Dmitriev competed before, during, and after {{the breakup of the}} Soviet Union, thus, they competed for the Soviet Union, the Unified Team, and Russia, all within a four-year period.|$|R
