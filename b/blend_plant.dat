Este projeto traz consigo resultados que v??o al??m da ??rea financeira, ao utilizar, da melhor forma, as cadeias log??sticas j?? existentes na regi??o, reduzindo, assim, o seu impacto na natureza. Uma vez que este projeto foi identificado ainda na sua fase de desenvolvimento, o m??todo de pesquisa utilizado foi a pesquisa-a????o. Neste tipo de m??todo, usam-se as teorias existentes para planejar as interven????es de campo, ao mesmo tempo que se aproveitam os resultados para gerar avan??os te??ricos. Os objetivos espec??ficos deste trabalho buscam estudar, primeiramente, as empresas fornecedoras de res??duos, analisando as suas localiza????es, bem como os tipos de produtos disponibilizados. A partir da??, ver o melhor lugar para instalar a planta produtora de mistura (blend), levando em considera????o as restri????es ambientais, os custos envolvidos e a oferta de modais de transporte, e por fim, analisar as empresas cimenteiras consumidoras de tal mistura. Os resultados mais importantes est??o relacionados ?? mudan??a de localiza????o da planta de coprocessamento, ao processo log??stico de coleta dos res??duos bem como do produto final e o desenvolvimento de uma embalagem para o seu transporte. As implica????es finais s??o ambientais, financeiras e estrat??gicas. Este projeto viabiliza o uso de uma parte significativa de res??duos que antes teriam como destino, na melhor das op????es, os aterros sanit??rios da regi??o, e agora passam ser uteis como combust??veis em uma nova cadeia de produ????o. J?? os resultados econ??micos atingiram as duas principais empresas estudas. Para a primeira, houve uma redu????o de 27 % no custo log??stico dos produtos produzidos. J?? para a segunda, 8 % no custo de combust??vel utilizado em fornos. Por fim, as estrat??gicas garantem, para a unidade de blendagem, um diferencial perante poss??veis novos entrantes no mercado. Para garantir tudo isso, esta pesquisa passa pelos conceitos de log??stica e log??stica reversa, fazendo um apanhado sobre a produ????o de cimento e relatando os combust??veis utilizados nestas plantas, com as suas futuras op????es de substitui????o, uma vez que este ?? um tipo de ind??stria altamente demandante de energia e calor. Finalmente, o caso analisado ?? a primeira planta de coprocessamento do Rio Grande do Sul que far?? uso de diversos tipos de res??duos na confec????o de um combust??vel alternativo para fornos de clinquer. This {{dissertation}} aims {{to study}} a waste co-processing, and develop {{a way to make}} it economically sustainable within the logistic and reverse logistics theory. This brings together results that go beyond the financial area, when the logistics chains in the region are used at best {{in order to reduce the}} impact on the environment. Once this research project has already been identified in its development phase, the method of research is action-research. In this type of method, they use existing theories to plan interventions in the field, while the results take advantage to generate theorist advancements. The specific aims of this paper target the study, firstly, of the waste suppliers, analyzing their locations as well as the kinds of available products. From this point of view, we can see the best place to install the production <b>blend</b> <b>plant,</b> taking into consideration the environmental restrictions, the costs and the offering of different types of transport, and finally it analyzes the cement consumer companies of such blend. The most important results are related to the changing of the co-processing plant location, the logistic process of waste collection as well as the final product and the development of a kind of suitable wrapping for its transport. The final consequences are environmental, financial and strategic. This project enables the use of a significant portion of waste that would previously have as destination, at best, the region's landfills, and are now being useful as fuels in a new production chain. Since the economic results achieved two major companies studied. For the first, there was a 27 % reduction in logistics costs of products produced. As for the second, 8 % of the cost of fuel. Finally, the strategic guarantee, for the blending unit, a differential to possible new entrants in the market. So, this study analyses the concepts on logistics and reverse-logistics, making an overview on the cement production and the different kinds of fuel used in these plants, with its future replacement options - once this is a type of industry that demands high amounts of energy and heating. Finally, the case study talks about the first co-processing plant in Rio Grande do Sul, which is going to use several sorts of waste in the manufacturing of an alternative kind of fuel for clinker kilns...|$|E

40|$|Problem statement: Kuwait is an arid {{country with}} limited natural water resources. As such, Kuwait {{produces}} its drinking water using the Multi-Stage-Flash method (MSF) in distillation plants to produce distilled water from sea water. The distilled water is blended with the brackish groundwater in different blending ratios, to produce drinking water, {{as recommended by}} World Health Organization (WHO). Approach: The main {{purposes of this study}} were to determine the best blending ratios in the <b>blending</b> <b>plants</b> of Kuwait to get the best quality of drinking water according to the WHO guidelines and to reveal and control the corrosivity of the produced drinking water. In order to find out the best blending ratio, samples of drinking water from the different <b>blending</b> <b>plants</b> and groundwater samples from water well fields have been collected during 2007 - 2008 and analyzed for the determination of basic cations and anions. Moreover, water samples collected from the main pump stations were analyzed for Langelier Index, to reveal the corossivity level of the drinking water. Results: It was found that the best blending ratio between distilled water and brackish groundwater to obtain drinking water is in the range of 7 - 8 % at Shuwaikh <b>blending</b> <b>plant,</b> 8 - 9 % at Shuaiba <b>blending</b> <b>plant</b> and 8 % at Doha <b>blending</b> <b>plant</b> respectively. While the best blending ratio at Az-Zour blending lines is between 3 - 4 % and between 4 - 5 % at Sabiya blending lines. Conclusion: It was found that the produced distilled water is corrosive and causing red water problem. In addition, {{it was found that the}} mean value of the Langelier Index at Shuaiba pump station is (- 0. 6) and the mean value of the total alkalinity is 21. 4 mg L - 1 as CaCO 3, which reveals that the drinking water from Shuaiba plant is more corrosive than the drinking water from the other plants...|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} the {{grotesque}} originated in medieval Italy {{with the discovery of}} early-Christian period Roman artifacts that <b>blended</b> <b>plant,</b> human, and architectural forms into simultaneously comic and terrifying amalgams. By the 16 th century, European writers began applying these distortions to literary works. Early examples are found in Rabelais and Cervantes, and later in Sterne and Hugo. As a literary term, “grotesque” has come to indicate a confluence of incompatible contents that evoke an ambivalent reader response: half laughter, half revulsion. This capacity to comedically unsettle is perhaps one reason for its popularity among authors of the 20 th and 21 st centuries such as Beckett, Kafka, Pynchon, and Ballard. However, one aspect of the modern grotesque remains largely unexamined: distortions of syntactic and grammatical form, as opposed to those of character and imagery. This project looks therefore at the formal-grotesque quality of indeterminacy in one element of David Foster Wallace’s 1996 opus Infinite Jest. The novel presents anomalous anaphoric narrative breaks, wherein breaks in the text are immediately followed by incomplete sentences that lack the orienting information of traditional narration. Employing the theories of Bakhtin, Shklovsky, and Iser, this project aims to elucidate this grotesque formal indeterminacy...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The odor {{produced}} by a plant under herbivore attack is often used by parasitic wasps to locate hosts. Any type of surface damage commonly causes plant leaves to release so-called green leaf volatiles, whereas blends of inducible compounds are more specific for herbivore attack and can vary considerably among plant genotypes. We compared the responses of naı̈ve and experienced parasitoids of the species Cotesia marginiventris and Microplitis rufiventris to volatiles from maize leaves with fresh damage (mainly green leaf volatiles) vs. old damage (mainly terpenoids) in a six-arm olfactometer. These braconid wasps are both solitary endoparasitoids of lepidopteran larvae, but differ in geographical origin and host range. In choice experiments with odor <b>blends</b> from maize <b>plants</b> with fresh damage vs. <b>blends</b> from <b>plants</b> with old damage, inexperienced C. marginiventris showed a preference for the volatiles from freshly damaged leaves. No such preference was observed for inexperienced M. rufiventris. After an oviposition experi-ence in hosts feeding on maize plants, C. marginiventris females were mor...|$|R
40|$|Beneficial soil-borne microbes, such as {{mycorrhizal}} fungi or rhizobacteria, {{can affect}} the interactions of plants with aboveground insects at several trophic levels. While the mechanisms of interactions with herbivorous insects, that is, the second trophic level, are starting to be understood, it remains unknown how plants mediate the interactions between soil microbes and carnivorous insects, that is, the third trophic level. Using Arabidopsis thaliana Col- 0 and the aphid Myzus persicae, we evaluate here the underlying mechanisms involved in the plant-mediated interaction between the non-pathogenic rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens and the parasitoid Diaeretiella rapae, by combining ecological, chemical and molecular approaches. Rhizobacterial colonization modifies {{the composition of the}} <b>blend</b> of herbivore-induced <b>plant</b> volatiles. The volatile blend from rhizobacteria-treated aphid-infested plants is less attractive to an aphid parasitoid, in terms of both olfactory preference behaviour and oviposition, than the volatile <b>blend</b> from aphid-infested <b>plants</b> without rhizobacteria. Importantly, the effect of rhizobacteria on both the emission of herbivore-induced volatiles and parasitoid response to aphid-infested plants is lost in an Arabidopsis mutant (aos/dde 2 - 2) that is impaired in jasmonic acid production. By modifying the <b>blend</b> of herbivore-induced <b>plant</b> volatiles that depend on the jasmonic acid-signalling pathway, root-colonizing microbes interfere with the attraction of parasitoids of leaf herbivores...|$|R
