25|$|In bioinformatics, the <b>basic</b> <b>method</b> of {{information}} processing is to contrast the sequence data. It {{has a very}} important significance when biologists use it to discover the function, structure and evolutionary information in biological sequences. From the sequence assembly, the phylogenetic analysis, the haplotype comparison, and the prediction of RNA structure are all based on sequence alignment, so the efficiency of sequence alignment, especially multiple sequence alignment, will directly affect {{the effect of these}} problems’ solution. Therefore, to design a rational and efficient sequence alignment algorithm becomes a very important branch of research in the field of bioinformatics.|$|E

25|$|The early Christian monks adapted {{techniques}} {{common in}} the art of memory as an art of composition and meditation, which was in keeping with the rhetorical and dialectical context in which it was originally taught. It became the <b>basic</b> <b>method</b> for reading and meditating upon the Bible after making the text secure within one's memory. Within this tradition, the art of memory was passed along to the later Middle Ages and the Renaissance (or Early Modern period). When Cicero and Quintilian were revived after the 13th century, humanist scholars understood the language of these ancient writers {{within the context of the}} medieval traditions they knew best, which were profoundly altered by monastic practices of meditative reading and composition.|$|E
25|$|In late 1936, Percival {{transferred}} {{production to}} larger facilities at the newly built Luton Corporation Airport in Bedfordshire. A two-bay hangar was constructed {{to accommodate the}} workshops while the design offices were {{set up in the}} original Georgian farmhouse situated nearby. Production at Luton was then primarily focused on the Vega Gull. A small twin-engined machine, the Q6 was also produced in limited quantities, using a pair of de Havilland Gipsy Six Series II powerplants equipped with variable-pitch airscrews. Again, the same <b>basic</b> <b>method</b> of construction was employed and the finished result was an aesthetically pleasing and aerodynamically clean feederliner of its day that represented the final new design produced by the company prior to Edgar Percival selling his interests in the company.|$|E
25|$|Probably {{the oldest}} and most <b>basic</b> <b>method</b> of holding the work is a planing stop or dog ear, which is simply a peg or small piece of wood or metal that stands just above the surface {{at the end of the}} bench top. The work is placed on the bench with the end pushed against the stop. The force of the planing keeps the board in place, so long as the force is always toward the stop. Planing against a stop gives the woodworker good {{feedback}} - he can tell a lot about what is going on just by the pressure, force and balance required. A stop can take the form of a batten attached to the end of the bench, or it can be adjustable, able to be moved up and down according to the size of the work - or pushed down below the surface when not needed. A simple bench dog can serve as a planing stop.|$|E

25|$|Relative dating {{techniques}} (based on {{a presumption}} that technology progresses over time) suggest that Acheulean tools followed on from earlier, cruder tool-making methods, {{but there is}} considerable chronological overlap in early prehistoric stone-working industries, with evidence in some regions that Acheulean tool-using groups were contemporary with other, less sophisticated industries such as the Clactonian and then later with the more sophisticated Mousterian, as well. It is therefore important not to see the Acheulean as a neatly defined period or one that happened {{as part of a}} clear sequence but as one tool-making technique that flourished especially well in early prehistory. The enormous geographic spread of Acheulean techniques also makes the name unwieldy as it represents numerous regional variations on a similar theme. The term Acheulean does not represent a common culture in the modern sense, rather it is a <b>basic</b> <b>method</b> for making stone tools that was shared across much of the Old World.|$|E
25|$|Differential {{cryptanalysis}} {{is usually}} a chosen plaintext attack, meaning that the attacker {{must be able to}} obtain ciphertexts for some set of plaintexts of their choosing. There are, however, extensions that would allow a known plaintext or even a ciphertext-only attack. The <b>basic</b> <b>method</b> uses pairs of plaintext related by a constant difference; difference can be defined in several ways, but the eXclusive OR (XOR) operation is usual. The attacker then computes the differences of the corresponding ciphertexts, hoping to detect statistical patterns in their distribution. The resulting pair of differences is called a differential. Their statistical properties depend upon the nature of the S-boxes used for encryption, so the attacker analyses differentials (ΔX, ΔY), where ΔY = S(X ⊕ ΔX) ⊕ S(X) (and ⊕ denotes exclusive or) for each such S-box S. In the basic attack, one particular ciphertext difference is expected to be especially frequent; in this way, the cipher can be distinguished from random. More sophisticated variations allow the key to be recovered faster than exhaustive search.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} <b>basic</b> <b>method</b> of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. Gust locks are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have gust locks fitted as part of the control system.|$|E

2500|$|The most <b>basic</b> <b>method</b> of {{checking}} the primality {{of a given}} integer n is called trial division.
