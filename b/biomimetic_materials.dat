50|$|For example, {{proteins}} {{constitute the}} elementary {{building blocks of}} a vast variety of biological materials such as cells, spider silk or bone, where they create extremely robust, multi-functional materials by self-organization of structures over many length- and time scales, from nano to macro. Some of the structural features are commonly found in many different tissues, that is, they are highly conserved. Examples of such universal building blocks include alpha-helices, beta-sheets or tropocollagen molecules. In contrast, other features are highly specific to tissue types, such as particularfilament assemblies, beta-sheet nanocrystals in spider silk or tendon fascicles. This coexistence of universality and diversity—referred to as the universality-diversity paradigm (UDP)—is an overarching feature in biological materials and a crucial component of materiomics. It might provide guidelines for bioinspired and <b>biomimetic</b> <b>material</b> development, where this concept is translated into the use of inorganic or hybrid organic-inorganic building blocks.|$|R
40|$|Cuttlebone signifies {{a special}} class of ultra-lightweight {{cellular}} natural material possessing unique chemical, mechanical and structural properties, which have drawn considerable {{attention in the}} literature. The aim {{of this paper is}} to better understand the mechanical and biological roles of cuttlebone. First, the existing literature concerning the characterisation and potential applications inspired by this remarkable biomaterial is critiqued. Second, the finite element-based homogenisation method is used to verify that morphological variations within individual cuttlebone samples have minimal impact on the effective mechanical properties. This finding agrees with existing literature, which suggests that cuttlebone strength is dictated by the cuttlefish habitation depth. Subsequently, this homogenisation approach is further developed to characterise the effective mechanical bulk modulus and biofluidic permeability that cuttlebone provides, thereby quantifying its mechanical and transporting functionalities to inspire bionic design of structures and materials for more extensive applications. Finally, a brief rationale for the need to design a <b>biomimetic</b> <b>material</b> inspired by the cuttlebone microstructure is provided, based on the preceding investigation...|$|R
50|$|A {{chemical}} sensor is a self-contained analytical device {{that can provide}} information about the chemical composition of its environment, that is, a liquid or a gas phase. The information is provided {{in the form of}} a measurable physical signal that is correlated with the concentration of a certain chemical species (termed as analyte). Two main steps are involved in the functioning of a {{chemical sensor}}, namely, recognition and transduction. In the recognition step, analyte molecules interact selectively with receptor molecules or sites included in the structure of the recognition element of the sensor. Consequently, a characteristic physical parameter varies and this variation is reported by means of an integrated transducer that generates the output signal.A chemical sensor based on recognition material of biological nature is a biosensor. However, as synthetic <b>biomimetic</b> <b>materials</b> are going to substitute to some extent recognition biomaterials, a sharp distinction between a biosensor and a standard chemical sensor is superfluous.
