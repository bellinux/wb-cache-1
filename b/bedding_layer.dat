The contact time is an important parameter when analysing the influence of the fluidstructure interaction on a fouling process. The contact time for a particle hitting a bed {{of particles}}is defined as the time it takes for the incident particle to bounce off the bed. The contact time fora particle hitting a bed of particles arranged in a rectangular and a hexagonal array is measuredexperimentally and calculated numerically based on the discrete element method.

40|$|The present {{research}} {{deals with the}} influence of local liquefaction in the surface ground on the underground structures by use of a linear finite element method. In the calculation, {{it is assumed that}} shear wave propagation velocity decreases with the degree of liquefaction. A summary of the results is given as follows. The distribution of the shearing stress and strain in the locally liquefied surface ground is very complicated. This is especially so in the liquefied area where the shear stress increases and the shearing strain decreases according to the degree of liquefaction of the adjacent area. In such a caisson structure that vibrates with the <b>bed</b> <b>layer,</b> the place in contact with the liquefied layer has a large shearing stress. On the other hand, in a tunnel structure that vibrates independently of the <b>bed</b> <b>layer,</b> the shearing stress and strain do not increase so much even if the layer in contact with it liquefies. The earth pressure acting on the structures is greatest when the surface ground incompletely liquefies and reverberates with an earthquake motion. From the above results, the authors think that the possibility of a resonance between a structure-ground system and an earthquake motion in a liquefaction process is very important. Furthermore, it is thought that local liquefaction of the surface ground has considerable effect upon the structures that vibrate with the <b>bed</b> <b>layer...</b>|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 Caissons on {{permeable}} seabeds {{have been}} designed and constructed {{for a variety of}} needs in coastal and offshore engineering. An evaluation of the adequacy of the foundation beneath the structure is required for an economic and safe design. To address this requirement, a two-dimensional analytical model of the foundation response is developed. The caisson is assumed to be placed on a rubblemound <b>bedding</b> <b>layer</b> overlying a soil of finite depth. The soil is considered to be homogeneous, isotropic, and linearly poroelastic. The soil responses, including displacements, stresses and porewater pressure, are modeled by Biot consolidation theory. This theory couples the soil skeleton motion and fluid flow. A boundary layer approximation technique is employed which enables the soil motion and pore pressure in the Biot theory to be solved separately. Linearity allows the wave-soil-caisson system to be decomposed into scattering and radiation problems. In the scattering problem, the caisson is assumed to be fixed and the soil response depends on the wave pressure on the mudline alone. In the radiation problem, the soil and wave forces on the caisson determined in the scattering problem impose caisson motion which in turn forces the soil response. Both problems are solved for the total stress employing classical elasticity. In the vicinity of the mudline, the boundary layer approximation yields one-dimensional Terzaghi consolidation theory to adjust the soil response due to fluid flow. In solving both scattering and radiation problems, a mixed-type boundary condition arises at the mudline. This mathematical complication is simplified by applying a solution technique developed for a contact problem of a rectangular stamp on a thin elastic layer. This thin layer limitation is to ensure negligible shear stress and vertical normal stress along the exposed surface of the seabed. The analytical solution is verified by comparison with a numerical solution developed for an elastic soil of finite depth. Results are in good agreement. In addition, large-scale experiments were conducted at the 0. H. Hinsdale Wave Research Facility at Oregon State University. The wave flume is 342 ft long, 12 ft wide, and 15 ft deep. A 10 -ft-high, 8 -ft-long and 4 -ft-wide caisson was placed on a <b>bedding</b> <b>layer</b> and 1 to 3 ft of underlying soil. The caisson was exposed to 0. 68 to 4. 40 ft waves with periods of 1. 77 to 8. 84 sec. Wave pressures were measured {{on the face of the}} caisson.

30|$|In {{terms of}} {{foundation}} design and settlement analysis, shallow-buried immersed tube tunnels generally have a requirement of low-additional load and low-bearing capacity, and so their foundation treatment adopts common cushion methods, including scraping the ground layer, the sand flow method, grouting method, sand filling method, and sand blasting method [74, 75].

40|$|Lafarge Gruntar™ {{material}} is proposed {{in this paper}} as a new thermal backfill component, and different mass fractions such as 5 %, 10 %, and 15 % are examined. The thermal properties of the developed backfill are determined by experiments with respect to water content and time. Based on the experimental data {{it is found that}} the 15 % mass fraction Lafarge Gruntar™ material provides the most favorable thermal conductivity i. e. over 1. 00 W/(m K) in the dry state. This paper also presents a thermal performance optimization procedure for the high voltage underground power cable system. The new thermal backfill {{material is}} considered to be installed within the cable system to improve its thermal performance. The analyzed system consists of three underground power cables situated in a flat formation (in−line arrangement) in thermal backfill, buried in the native soil. To avoid extensive mechanical loads caused by vibrations, when locating beneath a paved ground (e. g. under road crossings), the cables are situated in High Density Polyethylene (HDPE) casing pipes filled with sand−bentonite mixture. The pipes are then placed into a thermal backfill and buried in the native soil. The Installation of thermal backfill material is relatively expensive since in many cases the buried line is installed over many kilometers. Therefore, it is important to determine the optimal dimensions of the cable <b>bedding</b> <b>layer</b> to minimize the material and installation costs while keeping efficient heat dissipation from the cables. The momentum-type Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) solver, with a dynamic penalty function, is used to minimize the cable backfill cross-sectional area while not exceeding the allowable temperature of the cable operation. The performed optimization procedure obtains the converged solution. The temperature distribution in soil, cables, and the cable backfill layer is determined using the Finite Element Method. The Campbell − de Vries thermal conductivity model is employed for the soil surrounding the underground power cable system. An MATLAB code is written for solving the heat conduction equation and to determine the temperature distribution within the underground power cable system. By using the momentum-type Particle Swarm Optimization algorithm, it is possible to design the best-found dimensions of the cable <b>bedding</b> <b>layer</b> (width and height). Moreover, the dynamic penalty function employed in the optimization procedure has assured the determination of the maximum temperature of cable conductor close to its best-found value...|$|E

Results are presented from a forensic investigation of a permeable interlocking concrete paving (PICP) system {{that has been in}} service for over eight years. The aims were to quantify the sediment accumulation processes that occurred in the different pavement layers and to improve understanding of the change in the pavement hydraulic conductivity due to the trapped sediments. The majority of the sediment (by mass) was retained in the 2 – 5 mm aggregate <b>bedding</b> <b>layer,</b> irrespective of the pavement blockage conditions. While geofabrics are efficient at retaining sediment particles less than 33 µm in diameter, a maximum of only 8. 3 % of the total sediment mass was retained in the geofabric layers. Over 90 % of the sediments were trapped in the paving and bedding aggregate layers. The beneficial role of geofabric in filtering out sediments and protecting the integrity of the underlying basecourse may not be significant enough to warrant its inclusion in permeable pavement installations. The PICP system was very effective at filtering and retaining sediments from stormwater runoff. While this resulted in reduced permeability over time, the overall infiltration performance of the PICP system was still satisfactory after eight years of continuous service...|$|E

An Acoustic Concentration and Velocity Profiler (ACVP) is used to measure time-resolved profiles of collocated 2 C velocity (u,w) and sediment concentration and to measure the time evolution of the bed interface position. Ensemble averaging over eleven similar experiment realisations is done to evaluate the mean profiles of streamwise velocity, concentration, sediment flux and Reynolds shear stress. The repeatability, stationarity and uniformity of the flow are carefully checked for a Shields number θ ≈ 0. 5 and a suspension number of S = 1. 1. The mean profile analysis allows to separate the flow into two distinct layers: a suspension layer dominated by turbulence and a <b>bed</b> <b>layer</b> dominated by granular interactions. The <b>bed</b> <b>layer</b> can be further subdivided into a frictional layer capped by a collisional layer. In the suspension layer, the mixing length profile is linear with a strongly reduced von Karman parameter equal to 0. 225.

However, the strong intermittency of the flow observed in the <b>bed</b> <b>layer</b> under the impact of turbulent large-scale coherent flow structures suggests the limitations of averaged steady two-phase flow models...|$|R

Concrete block pavements (CBP) have historically been hics. used in low trafficked applications as an alternative to asphalt and concrete pavement because of their aesthetic quality. However, concrete block pavements have not been used for high volume, urban streets {{because of the lack of}} a design procedure that can accurately predict the performance of the pavement. This thesis presents a step by step design procedure that can be used to construct a concrete block pavement that is to allow water to infiltrate into the subbase thereby reducing the amount of surface water runoff. The pavement design considers the vehicle loads and intensities, subgraph strength, material strengths, and environmental conditions. Most importantly the design procedure provides a measure of the pavement's performance by predicting the amount of rutting. This thesis also presents the analysis of the structural performance of a concrete block pavement that was constructed at Texas A&M's Riverside campus. The empirical data indicates that the rutting of a concrete block pavement will decrease as the thickness of the subbase increases. It also indicates that an angular jointing sand will provide better interlock 01 the paver blocks than a s 11300 th, rounded jointing sand. The test data also shows that a paver block that interlocks on four sides will rut less than a paver block that interlocks on two sides. It is also apparent that most of the pavement's rutting occurred in the <b>bedding</b> <b>layer.</b> Computer modeling of the empirical data indicates that the concrete block pavement behaves like a flexible pavement and can be modeled as linear elastic with an equivalent asphalt layer 1 - 1. 5 times the thickness of the paver blocks...|$|E

The GI installed in Louisville are suffering from extensive and rapid surface clogging and in order to optimize current and future GI, an understanding of the factors affecting the performance of the system is required. The study used the current literature to determine the surrounding factors and those of the permeable surface that had not been investigated enough, and used several configurations of GI {{to determine the effects of}} these variables on the surface clogging. The module used to test these variables was a wooden flume, specifically designed and constructed from plywood so that the variables of the experiment could be incorporated in testing. The flume simulates a permeable pavement system with storage gallery and a <b>bedding</b> <b>layer,</b> and is paved with three different interlocking concrete pavements that provide gaps of three different sizes. The flume’s longitudinal slope can be adjusted, and the permeable joint material can be included. The performance of the flume was measured using 7 time domain reflectometer (TDRs) instruments, manufactured by Campbell Scientific, which are located inside the storage gallery. After conducting 21 experiments with various configurations, the data was analyzed to reveal meaningful information. As expected, the experiments with permeable joint material show a clear separation for the sediment deposited on the surface, where empty gaps resulted in inorganics being deposited on the up gradient and organics on the down gradient. The Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) of the progression of clogging and progression of infiltration edge on the permeable surface showed that the increase of gap size from 6 mm to 9 mm did not result in a significant change, but the change to 12 mm gaps resulted in a significantly different rate for the progression of the first rate.

The construction of the test section consisted of: (a) Construction of a cement-treated base (CTB), (b) Preparation of a sand <b>bedding</b> <b>layer,</b> (c) Placement of the pre-cast slabs, (d) Application of grout materials for the bedding and for the dowel/tie bars, (e) Diamond grinding the test pads, (f) Filling the joints, and (g) Construction of an asphalt concrete shoulder. Subgrade evaluation was carried out with a dynamic cone penetrometer (DCP) and indicated a strong granular subgrade, with CBR (California Bearing Ratio) between 45 and 80. Average backcalculated elastic modulus for the CTB was about 2, 200 MPa (tested on the pre-cast panels) and presented great variation. Subgrade modulus was 70 MPa (tested on CTB, consistent with results of testing on pre-cast panels). FWD testing showed deflections of 0. 3 to 0. 6 mm on the slabs, which after grouting were reduced to approximately 0. 2 mm. The backcalculated elastic modulus of the concrete was found to be between 19, 000 and 23, 500 MPa (after grouting, averaging morning, and afternoon FWD data). Load Transfer Efficiency (LTE) values in the range of 5 % to 40 % were observed before grouting, and consistently near 100 % after grouting, revealing that the grouting process mobilized the dowel bars so that they provided effective LTE. The materials used for the dowel grout and for the bedding grout showed flexural strengths at 28 -days of 5. 1 and 1. 7 MPa, respectively. The slabs were instrumented with displacement sensors (vertical and horizontal) and with thermocouples. Thermal deformations were collected, and revealed that the slab curl reduced from a range of ± 1. 5 mm before grouting to ± 0. 5 mm after grouting. The responses to traffic load also improved greatly after grouting. The wheel-induced deflections at the transverse joint decreased to one-quarter of the initial value at the standard load of 60 kN (from about 1. 0 mm to 0. 25 mm). Rocking of the slabs, present before grouting, was also eliminated by grouting. Two HVS tests were performed on the ungrouted slabs and indicated that the Super-Slab® System is able to withstand at least 86, 500 ESALS in the ungrouted condition.

Preston Lake, Van Nostrand Lake and Musselman Lake are three such examples.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the later}} {{part of the}} Lower Jurassic, {{southern}} Africa {{was the scene of}} massive volcanism, resulting in extensive lava flows (so called flood basalts) that covered much of southern Africa and Antarctica. These basalt formations are known as the Karoo-Ferrar large igneous province. Vulcanodon comes from the [...] "Vulcanodon beds", a fossil-bearing sediment unit within the Batoka Formation, which is composed primarily of flood basalts. The skeleton was found near the top of a 30 m (98.5 ft) thick <b>bedded</b> <b>layer</b> of sand- and siltstone that is over- and underlain by flood basalts.|$|R
40|$|Sediment cores {{recovered}} from three holes drilled during Ocean Drilling Program Leg 136 include volcaniclastics probably {{derived from the}} Hawaiian islands. The volcaniclastics shallower than 10 meters below seafloor are fresh and are composed of basaltic glass (sideromelane), basaltic fragments (mainly tachylite), plagioclase, olivine, pyroxene, and opaque minerals. Most of these glasses are probably products of hydrovolcanism. Visibly, some of these volcaniclastics are recognized as <b>bedded</b> ash <b>layers</b> having thicknesses that range from 5 to 10 cm. However, many volcaniclastics are disrupted by bioturbation to some degree, and are sometimes totally mixed with ambient brown clays. No visible correlative ash layer among these holes was found. It seems that many ash layers thinner than the <b>bedded</b> <b>layers</b> were disrupted by bioturbation because of the low sedimentation rate of volcaniclastics. The volcaniclastics were probably transported one of two ways: through air fall and pelagic settling or through turbidity-current transport. Other archipelagic apron volcaniclastic sediments of volcanic seamounts suggest that turbidite transport is the favored explanation of origin...|$|R
