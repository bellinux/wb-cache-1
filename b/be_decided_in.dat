5|$|In 1823, Wickliffe {{was elected}} to the U.S. House of Representatives and served five {{consecutive}} terms. Again he succeeded his cousin and friend, Ben Hardin. Though a Whig, he disagreed with many of the positions of the party's founder, Henry Clay. When no candidate received a majority of the electoral votes in the 1824 presidential election, the constitution mandated that the election <b>be</b> <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> the House. Wickliffe bucked Clay's advice to vote for him and instead voted for Andrew Jackson, who was the choice of the Kentucky legislature.|$|E

The fourth game was won by Toronto to lead the series 3–1.|$|E

5|$|The tournaments {{follow the}} rules used by the IIHF. At the 1969 IIHF Congress, {{officials}} voted to allow body-checking in all three zones in a rink similar to the NHL. Before that, body-checking was only allowed in the defending zone in international hockey. Several other rule changes were implemented in the early 1970s: players were required to wear helmets starting in 1970, and goaltender masks became mandatory in 1972. In 1992, the IIHF switched to using a playoff system to determine medalists and decided that tie games in the medal round would <b>be</b> <b>decided</b> <b>in</b> a shootout. In 1998, the IIHF passed a rule that allowed two-line passes. Before then, the neutral zone trap had slowed the game down and reduced scoring.|$|E
