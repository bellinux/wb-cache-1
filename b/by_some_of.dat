Biko's position as an individual who had never been convicted of a crime led to the death being reported in the international press; he thus became one of first anti-apartheid activists widely known internationally.|$|E

5|$|An {{emergency}} subscription {{fund was}} established <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the city's wealthiest citizens.

5|$|Blonde on Blonde is {{the seventh}} studio album by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan, {{released}} on May 16, 1966, on Columbia Records. Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, {{including members of}} Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded.|$|E
5|$|During his lifetime, Rodin was {{compared}} to Michelangelo, and was widely recognized as the greatest artist of the era.

The sense of incompletion offered <b>by</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his sculpture, such as The Walking Man, influenced the increasingly abstract sculptural forms of the 20th century.|$|E
