Soon the women bought some equipment for the <b>business,</b> <b>like</b> utensils, cupboards, stoves, etc. In the first year, the organisation's annual sales were Rs. 6196.

25|$|Utility-scale {{wind farms}} must {{have access to}} {{transmission}} lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install extra equipment or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line. The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether {{to hold on to}} the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big <b>business</b> <b>like</b> GE, for example.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{establishing}} Strategic Marine in 2001, Mark was the Executive Director of Geraldton Boat Builders (GBB) and {{his experiences in}} that business convinced him {{that there was more}} opportunity for a <b>business</b> <b>like</b> Strategic Marine in Asia as opposed to Australia, provided the company had its own, more cost-effective shipyards overseas. In 2005 a Singapore shipyard was acquired and is developing the reputation of delivering vessels well ahead of schedule. The company also has a Vietnam shipyard, with over 1000 staff working to a full order book, including a $62 million contract for the Western Australian Government.|$|E
25|$|His {{start in}} show <b>business,</b> <b>like</b> his early life, is also {{shrouded}} in myth. Most sources cite his first female role originally having {{been at the}} age of ten with the Boston Cadets Review at the Tremont Theater in Boston. He is reported to have played the role so well that the next year the revue was written around him which led to minor roles elsewhere. But as to how he came to perform as a female a decade later with the Boston Cadets, sources differ. In some versions he was taking cakewalk lessons from a Mrs. Wyman's dance studio when he impressed upon his teacher an incredible ability to emulate females. It is said to be Mrs. Wyman who encouraged young William to study the art of female impersonation. Boys often play female roles in all male theater groups.|$|E

500|$|In his autobiography, Hardee {{claimed he}} was the first to attempt the 'banger-up-the-bum' routine, later perfected and {{performed}} by Greatest Show on Legs co-star Chris Lynam, in which a firework (occasionally a three-stage Roman Candle) was clenched between the buttocks and lit to a recording of Ethel Merman singing [...] "There's No <b>Business</b> <b>Like</b> Show Business".|$|E
500|$|On occasion, {{the episodes}} {{will be used}} to {{showcase}} special animation, such as the [...] "Treehouse of Horror VI" [...] segment [...] "Homer3", in which a computer-animated Homer is shown in a non-animated setting. At the time (1995), it was groundbreaking, as it was unusual for a television show to use such animation. The segment was executive producer Bill Oakley's idea and included live action directed by David Mirkin. [...] "Treehouse of Horror XX" [...] included the segment [...] "There's No <b>Business</b> <b>Like</b> Moe Business", which was the first to be musically-themed.|$|E
500|$|The way {{she treated}} the serial's {{teenagers}} as adults also endeared {{her to the}} younger viewers. Daphne gave up {{her career as a}} stripper to run the coffee shop, which her grandfather Harry Henderson (Johnny Lockwood) gave to her, after he won it in a poker game. Kingsley commented that Daphne ran the <b>business</b> <b>like</b> [...] "a pro". Daphne's position in the coffee shop meant that customers often confided in her and she helped mediate between several parents and their children. She also gained the trust and affection of the teenage characters, most notably Mike Young (Guy Pearce), who she took under her wing, later becoming his legal guardian.|$|E

500|$|Monroe's {{next film}} was Otto Preminger's Western River of No Return, {{which had been}} filmed prior to her {{suspension}} and featured Robert Mitchum as her co-star. She called it a [...] "Z-grade cowboy movie in which the acting finished second to the scenery and the CinemaScope process", although it was popular with audiences. The first film she made after returning to Fox was the musical There's No <b>Business</b> <b>Like</b> Show Business, which she strongly disliked but the studio required her to do in exchange for dropping The Girl in Pink Tights. The musical was unsuccessful upon its release in December, and Monroe's performance was considered vulgar by many critics.|$|E
500|$|Some {{similarities}} {{exist between}} the character of W.P. Mayhew and novelist William Faulkner. Like Mayhew, Faulkner became known as a preeminent writer of Southern literature and later worked in the movie <b>business.</b> <b>Like</b> Faulkner, Mayhew is a heavy drinker and speaks contemptuously about Hollywood. Faulkner's name appeared in the Hollywood 1940s history book City of Nets, which the Coens read while creating Barton Fink. Ethan explained in 1998: [...] "I read this story in passing that Faulkner was assigned to write a wrestling picture.... That {{was part of what}} got us going on the whole Barton Fink thing." [...] Faulkner worked on a wrestling film called Flesh (1932), which starred Wallace Beery, the actor for whom Barton is writing. The focus on wrestling was fortuitous for the Coens, as they participated in the sport in high school.|$|E
500|$|In mid-November, they {{performed}} at the Bag O'Nails nightclub in London, with Clapton, John Lennon, Paul McCartney, Jeff Beck, Pete Townshend, Brian Jones, Mick Jagger, and Kevin Ayers in attendance. Ayers described the crowd's reaction as stunned disbelief: [...] "All the stars were there, and I heard serious comments, you know 'shit', 'Jesus', 'damn' and other words worse than that." [...] The successful performance earned Hendrix his first interview, published in Record Mirror with the headline: [...] "Mr. Phenomenon". [...] "Now hear this... we predict that [...] is going to whirl around the <b>business</b> <b>like</b> a tornado", wrote Bill Harry, who asked the rhetorical question: [...] "Is that full, big, swinging sound really being created by only three people?" [...] Hendrix commented: [...] "We don't want to be classed in any category... If it must have a tag, I'd {{like it to be}} called, 'Free Feeling'. It's a mixture of rock, freak-out, rave and blues". After appearances on the UK television shows Ready Steady Go! and the Top of the Pops, [...] "Hey Joe" [...] entered the UK charts on December 29, 1966, peaking at number six. Further success came in March 1967 with the UK number three hit [...] "Purple Haze", and in May with [...] "The Wind Cries Mary", which remained on the UK charts for eleven weeks, peaking at number six.|$|E
