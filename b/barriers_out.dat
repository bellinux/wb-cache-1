A further difference is that, historically, members of the programmer subculture of hackers were working at academic institutions and used the computing environment there. In contrast, the prototypical computer security hacker had access exclusively to a home computer and a modem. However, since the mid-1990s, with home computers that could run Unix-like operating systems and with inexpensive internet home access being available for the first time, many people from outside of the academic world started to take part in the programmer subculture of hacking.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Forty-five {{percent of}} {{patients}} in Canada are admitted to hospital already malnourished. Compared to well-nourished patients, those with diminished nutritional status are at {{an increased risk of}} in-hospital mortality and several medical complications. As a result, malnourished patients take longer to recover, stay hospitalized longer, {{and are more likely to}} be readmitted to hospital after discharge, costing the healthcare system more to care for them. Improving nutritional status in hospital can improve recovery and shorten length of stay. Insufficient food intake (FI) is common in hospital and has also been associated with longer lengths of stay (LOS), leading to further declines in nutritional status. Thus, ensuring sufficient patient FI could improve patient outcomes and reduce costs of care by reducing nutritional decline. However, current FI monitoring practices in hospital are generally ad hoc. Most hospitals don’t have the resource capacity to have staff monitor every patient’s FI, so monitoring practices are sparsely or inaccurately completed for only a portion of patients. There are also barriers to FI that occur in hospital, which include a range of potential mealtime issues patients could experience that further prevent them from consuming enough food. These barriers are simple issues that can easily go unrecognized by staff and their existence isn’t formally assessed or monitored in current practice. Creating practices that allow 1) the accurate monitoring of all patients’ FI, and 2) the identification and removal of FI barriers, could increase the efficacy of hospitals to provide sufficient nutrition care and fight the prevalence of malnutrition through increased patient FI. PURPOSE: The purpose of this thesis was to complete key steps in the development and testing of two novel hospital nutrition care tools. The My Meal Intake Tool (M-MIT), a patient-completed FI monitoring tool, was tested for feasibility and criterion validity in a clinical setting. The Mealtime Audit Tool (MAT), a hospital staff-completed tool for the identification of FI barriers, was tested for feasibility and inter-rater reliability in a clinical setting. METHODS & MAJOR FINDINGS: Two studies were conducted as part of this thesis work. 	Study 1 : Patients from four Canadian hospitals (n= 120) were recruited to participate in the feasibility testing of both the M-MIT and the MAT, as well as the criterion validation of the M-MIT. Participants estimated their food and fluid intake using the M-MIT at one mealtime. M-MIT results were validated against dietitian visual estimations of their FI for the same meal. At a separate mealtime, a dietitian completed the MAT with the participants, identifying the barriers that they experienced at that mealtime. 78 % of participants were able to estimate their FI on the M-MIT without error. Sensitivity and specificity of M-MIT’s ability to identify participants who consumed < 50 % of their meal were 76. 2 % and 74. 0 % (p < 0. 001) respectively, indicating sufficient criterion validity; sensitivity analyses including those who did not complete the tool resulted in a range of sensitivity from 53. 3 % to 83. 3 % and specificity from 60. 0 % to 78. 9 %. The results of the validity analyses, in combination with patient follow-up interviews and clinician feedback, were used to make revisions to the tool to improve the feasibility and ease of use of M-MIT. Descriptive analyses were conducted to characterize barriers experienced by participants according to the MAT, and clinician feedback was used to make revisions to the MAT before Study 2. 	Study 2 : Ninety patients from multiple medical and surgical units in a Canadian hospital were recruited to participate in the inter-rater reliability testing of the MAT across 30 different mealtimes. Two auditors completed the MAT with each of the 90 participants within a few minutes of each other after the participants had completed their meals. The MAT tabulates a total score of the number of <b>barriers</b> (<b>out</b> of 18) experienced at a mealtime. Total MAT scores between the two auditors showed good agreement, with an intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0. 68 (0. 52 - 0. 79). About two-thirds of the 18 barrier items listed on the MAT showed good to excellent agreement between the two auditors, according to calculated kappa statistics. The inter-rater reliability analyses, descriptive analyses, and clinician feedback from Study 1 and Study 2 were used to make revisions to improve functionality and ease of use of the MAT. OVERALL CONCLUSIONS: The studies within this thesis have shown the M-MIT and MAT have good potential for use in clinical practice. If implemented into use, the tools have the potential to play a role in improving nutrition care. These tools could help standardize processes (FI monitoring, assessment of FI barriers) that are currently ad hoc or non-existent. However, changing existing care practices is an extremely complex task. There is still work to be done to further test and refine the tools, as well as to determine whether these tools can feasibly be integrated into routine practices, and if their use leads to improvement in patient outcomes...|$|E
40|$|In {{this report}} the {{possibilities}} of sustainable heat supply in South-Holland are reviewed. The province of South-Holland has set ambitious targets to reach 20 PJ sustainable heat in 2020, which {{is defined by the}} province as renewable heat plus waste heat. On the longer term a sustainable heat and cold share of 50 % in 2050 is aimed for. This is based on opportunities such as a large demand for heat, a large availability of waste heat and the specific opportunities in the horticultural sector in the region. However the low existing sustainable heat consumption in South-Holland as well as the existence of numerous barriers to the implementation of sustainable heat means there is a long way to go. After analysing the existing and planned sustainable heat and cold projects and taking into account the business as usual growth of different sustainable heat technologies, it is clear that reaching the 2020 targets will indeed be extremely difficult. By continuing on the current track just over half of the targeted amount will be reached, if all planned projects follow through. In order to increase the chance of meeting the targets, focus must lie with those areas in which large potentials can be reached, such as geothermal energy in the horticultural sector. However, the rest of the technologies and sectors must not be forgotten. In the end the targets can only be reached if all different technologies fulfil their share and if all sectors become significantly more sustainable. This being said, large shares of the total heat demand are unfitted for sustainable heat supply because of practical barriers, for instance retrofitting existing buildings with sustainable heat technologies is impractical and expensive. This {{must be taken into account}} and policy should initially be targeted at those shares of the build environment that are more suitable, such as large office buildings and apartment complexes to be build. Considering the long term sustainable heat targets merely stimulating the separate sustainable heat technologies is not sufficient, instead a transition to a sustainable heat regime must be aimed for. In order to keep on the right track towards this transition, but also to increase the effectiveness of policies on the short term, an analysis of the barriers in place should be the starting point to base policy upon. By basing this barriers analysis on transition and innovation theories the focus will lie with transformative change, this reduces the risk of policies that provide short term gains without constructively adding to a long term solution for the problems resulting from fossil fuel use. This barriers analysis takes into account the limits of the role of the province by acknowledging the existence of barriers that cannot be influenced, such as the low price of fossil fuels as a result of the externalization of negative costs. The most important barriers are found to be the complexity of the heat network, the lack of coordination between policies and activities on different governmental and sectoral levels and the lack of focus on the demand side of the heat system. There are of course more barriers that play a role and most barriers are to some extent interconnected. For instance the lack of sustainable heat infrastructure can partly be overcome by targeting this problem in association with other parties, reverting back to the complex network barrier. In order to reduce these barriers, measures and policies need to be implemented. The program office that is set up in South-Holland must be used to unite the complex network, by recognizing shared goals and profitable projects, the network can be better used to realise and promote sustainable heat. By aligning provincial policies with the national government and municipalities in the province the aim to stimulate transformative change will be shared between parties and embedded in policies. This should reduce opposing policies and aid the development of long term stable policies towards a sustainable heat regime. Furthermore, by carrying out research into the demand side needs and perceptions, by increasing the promotion of sustainable heat and cold and by making sustainable heat better suited to the needs of users, the extent of sustainable heat in the built environment can be increased. Lastly practical barriers such as the lack of infrastructure should be overcome as much as possible, for instance by setting up a provincial guarantee scheme for geothermal energy and by supporting the development of local thermal grids. If the province would succeed in largely overcoming the barriers in place, a sustainable heat potential of over 18 PJ in 2020 and 48 PJ in 2050 can be reached. This is clearly in reach of reaching the provincial sustainable heat targets, reaching this potential would form a good starting point towards significantly more sustainable heat in South-Holland in a way that is supportive of a system transition. However, for the province of South-Holland it is considered foremost important not to focus too much on the actual number of PJs but to focus more on the process of sustainable heat supply and the desired transition. The output of sustainable heat depends to a large extent on external factors and <b>barriers</b> <b>out</b> of scope. By focusing not on the target but on the process, the province can clear the way for a transition towards a sustainable heat regime that can be reached over time by coupling efforts with other parties and by moving in the right direction together...|$|E
40|$|There are 4 {{billion people}} with income less than $ 3000 per year, which {{belong to the}} Base of Pyramid (BoP) market segment. These people share similar {{characteristics}} such as experiencing health problems, lack of education and poor living conditions. This state is realized by several entrepreneurs as potential business opportunities, which come in form of technology solutions such as solar lanterns, drinking-water purifiers, and biomass cook stoves. Through the provision of these technologies, entrepreneurs focusing on the BoP aim at getting profit, {{while at the same}} time consciously provide technologies that can solve the aforementioned issues. On the other hand, even though there is an increasing trend and influx of investment by these social enterprises, many companies still find it difficult to scale their solution to the poor. For example, many technologies are only sold in constrained geographic markets and unable to be replicated to other markets or regions to achieve an appropriate scale of business. Thus, the research aims to understand on how technology firms focusing on BoP can solve the barriers of scaling and implementing niche strategies to grow their business. To understand the matter, the research will identify and analyze barriers, strategies and also the linkage between them. In addition, the research also establishes the relative importance of each barrier and strategy that is relevant in the BoP market. From the research, it is understood that the issue of scaling from these BoP companies can be approached by using niche concept. Niche is defined as an application of technology to small number of people that precedes the diffusion of these products to a mass-market. The approach is known to be used for analyzing technology introduction in the western market. This research aims to extend the application of the niche concept in the new field at the BoP. The research is conducted in three steps; the first phase is the theoretical gap identification from the previous studies of strategic niche management, high-technology diffusion and BoP literatures. Second phase is the identification on barriers and strategies, in which a draft list of barriers and strategies is identified and validated by conducting interviews with BoP experts and desk research of secondary case studies. The last phase is the validation of barriers and strategies & identification of their relative importance. In this last phase, six primary case studies are conducted through interviews with companies that sell three kinds of products: solar lantern, drinking water purifier and biomass cook stove. The final outcome of the research is a total of identified 21 barriers, which are grouped into three categories: market, consumer and company <b>barriers.</b> <b>Out</b> of 21 barriers that have been identified, 9 barriers are categorized as essential barriers at the BoP: Financial Capital, Affordability, Consumer’s Awareness, Institutional aspects, Knowledge of Application, Production system, Consumer's Demand, Natural Resources Labor & Employee and Infrastructure. From the aforementioned barriers, the financial capital is found to be the most important barrier as companies require funding for working capital in the form of credit for their partners, material for their products and also marketing funding for promotion to consumers. Moreover, 15 niche strategies are also identified, with 8 of them are considered to be essential niche strategies: partner network strategy, access to finance, education approach, demo experiment and develop, explore multiple markets, geographic approach, technology complementary strategy and upper-income BoP market segment approach. ? From the aforementioned strategies, partner network strategy is identified as the most important strategy. Partners can come in different forms such as distributors, resellers, NGOs and local organizations. Partners are required due to the need for the company to access local market. For example, several companies require cooperation with local entrepreneurs or informal organizations to help promote and sell their product to local society. Partners also provide flexibility, as one region may require different approaches in relation to the condition or consumer preference. In this research, the linkage between barriers and strategy is obtained. In most situations, it is found that a strategy can solve more than one barrier. For example, partner network strategy is found to be relevant to help solve the essential barrier of financial capital and affordability. These linkages also indicate geographic approach as an important strategy as its implementation can solve several barriers of government policy, consumer’s demand and natural resources & labor. In addition, from the six study cases, the notion of context-specific barriers & strategies is known. The notion indicates that barriers and strategies can be affected by the context of company, region, products and time. Those factors give the notion of dynamic barriers, which means that barriers are changing over time depending on the condition of the company and market. This revelation thus can affect the kind of strategies that company needs to develop overtime. The research extends this notion by identifying several possible stages that companies need to go through in their quest to pursue a large-scale market. The implication of findings is important for both managers and academic society. From managerial perspective, the findings of the research are important as tools to help managers identify a solution for specific barrier that companies encounter in the BoP market. From an academic perspective, this research enriches the application of strategic niche management theory by applying it in the new domain of the Base of Pyramid market. In addition, it is found that the notion of the dynamic barriers, which is still not quite covered in this research, will be an important step for further research. Understanding and predicting the stages and development of barriers that a company encounters can shed light for many companies to scale their product in this market. Next, the need of universal product design that may be relevant for different markets can be crucial in company’s attempt to achieve a large-scale market. Lastly, the understanding of the current BoP firms operation extends the idea for the companies to implement global scale niche market strategy, in which firms operate by selling small number of products in number of countries to develop their product and market.

50|$|In the Second World War, RAF Leiston, 1 mi north-west of {{the town}} in the {{neighbouring}} village of Theberton, sent fighter squadrons of the American 357th Fighter Group to fight the Luftwaffe. Famous American test pilot and fighter ace General Chuck Yeager (later, first to break the sound <b>barrier)</b> flew <b>out</b> of RAF Leiston. The Friends of Leiston Airfield hold a memorial service and flying display {{at the end of}} May each year, with veterans and their families attending.|$|R
50|$|To {{prevent the}} convicts from {{escaping}} he orders his 12 most powerful magicians {{to erect a}} magical dome over the mining colony. However, the <b>Barrier</b> goes <b>out</b> of control and grows large {{enough to cover the}} entire valley, trapping the magicians inside, and giving the convicts a chance to kill the distracted guards and take control over the colony. The king is thus forced to come to an agreement with the prisoners, trading goods for ore.|$|R
6000|$|I don't stop at this illustration. I {{come to the}} State of Indiana; {{and what}} I have said as between Kentucky and Ohio, I repeat as between Indiana and Kentucky: it is equally applicable. One {{additional}} argument is applicable also to Indiana. In her Territorial condition she more than once petitioned Congress to abrogate the Ordinance entirely, or {{at least so far}} as to suspend its operation for a time, in order that they should exercise the [...] "popular sovereignty" [...] of having slaves if they wanted them. The men then controlling the General Government, imitating the men of the Revolution, refused Indiana that privilege. And so we have the evidence that Indiana supposed she could have slaves, {{if it were not for}} that Ordinance; that she besought Congress to put that <b>barrier</b> <b>out</b> of the way; that Congress refused to do so; and it all ended at last in Indiana being a free State. Tell me not then that the Ordinance of '87 had nothing to do with making Indiana a free State, when we find some men chafing against, and only restrained by, that barrier.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} general {{framework}} for the generation, alignment, comparison, and hybridization of motion pathways between two known protein conformations. The framework, which is rooted in probabilistic motion-planning techniques in robotics, allows for the efficient generation of collision-free motion pathways, while considering {{a wide range of}} degrees of freedom involved in the motion. Within the framework, we provide the means to hybridize pathways, thus producing, the motion pathway of the lowest energy <b>barrier</b> <b>out</b> of the many pathways proposed by our algorithm. This method for comparing and hybridizing pathways is modular, and may be used within the context of molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. The framework was implemented within the Rosetta software suite, where the protein is represented in atomic detail. The K-channels switch between open and closed conformations, and we used the overall framework to investigate this transition. Our analysis suggests that channel-opening may follow a three-phase pathway. First, the channel unlocks itself from the closed state; second, it opens; and third, it locks itself in the open conformation. A movie that depicts the proposed pathway is available in the Supplementary Material (Movie S 1) and at [URL]...|$|R
