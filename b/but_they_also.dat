5|$|As the DVD {{featurette}} Within a Minute illustrates, {{the film}} required 910 artists and 70,441 man-hours to create 49 seconds of footage for the Mustafar duel alone.

Benefits included not only special articles, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> received access to a webcam that transmitted a new image every 20 seconds during {{the time it was}} operating in Fox Studios Australia. Many times the stars, and Lucas himself, were spotted on the webcam.|$|E
5|$|Competition {{from new}} superpredators, such as macropredatory sperm whales which {{appeared}} in the Miocene, and killer whales and great white sharks in the Pliocene, may have also contributed to the decline and extinction of megalodon. Fossil records indicate that the new whale-eating cetaceans commonly occurred at high latitudes during the Pliocene, indicating that they could cope with the increasingly prevalent cold water temperatures; <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> occurred in the tropics (e.g., Orcinus sp. in South Africa).|$|E
5|$|Historians hold differing {{views as}} to whether the mounted police were neutral in these {{disputes}} or sided with the employers, although all agree that the position of the police in managing the strikes became more difficult as organised labour became better established. The mounted police disliked labour agitators and strikers with eastern or southern European backgrounds, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> had some sympathy for the difficulties faced by ordinary workers, and were often unwilling to actively assist the company owners if there was a risk it might cause disturbances to break out.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the giant}} panda, they cannot digest cellulose, {{so they must}} consume a large volume of bamboo to survive.

Occasionally, they {{supplement}} their diets with fish and insects. They {{do little more than}} eat and sleep due to their low-calorie diets.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{a number}} of other Australians were {{subsequently}} involved in the Malleson Mission under Major General (Sir) Wilfrid Malleson in Turkestan during 1918â€“1919, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> saw little fighting. Malleson's aim was to block possible German-Turkish thrusts towards India and Afghanistan, but instead his soldiers became involved in fighting the Bolsheviks around Merv. The force withdrew by April 1919.|$|E
5|$|Needle {{receiving}} tubes: A hollow tube made of metal, shatter-resistant {{glass or}} plastic, needle receiving tubes, like forceps, {{are used to}} support the tissue at the piercing site and are common in septum and some cartilage piercings.

The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. Instances of river otters eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds {{have been reported}} as well.|$|E
5|$|Not {{only were}} such monasteries an {{expression}} of David's undoubted piety, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>also</b> functioned to transform Scottish society. Monasteries became centres of foreign influence, and provided sources of literate men, able to serve the crown's growing administrative needs. These new monasteries, and the Cistercian ones in particular, introduced new agricultural practices. Cistercian labour, for instance, transformed southern Scotland into one of northern Europe's most important sources of sheep wool.|$|E
