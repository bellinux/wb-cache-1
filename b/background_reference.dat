40|$|Abstract â€” This paper {{presents}} a moving object detection method with background subtraction and shadow removal. Accurate background subtraction {{is necessary to}} detect and track various objects. Objects and shadows similar in color are major problems in background subtraction and tracking. Firstly, this method uses background subtraction to detect moving objects that have casted shadows. A background reconstruction scheme is developed secondly, to create a dynamically updated <b>background</b> <b>reference</b> image. And thirdly, shadows are removed by comparing and analyzing the reference image with the original video frame. We propose a new method for shadow removal by clubbing two existing methods which provides more accuracy thus improving the performance consistently...|$|E
