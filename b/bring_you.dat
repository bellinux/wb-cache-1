5|$|After the war, of course, {{the roads}} were all bad. There were cobbles from the moment you left Paris, or Senlis where we started in those days. There'd be {{stretches}} of surfaced roads and often there'd be a cycle path or a pavement and sometimes a thin stretch of something smoother. But you never knew where was best to ride and you were for ever switching about. You could jump your bike up on to a pavement but that got harder the more tired you got. Then you'd get your front wheel up but not your back wheel. That happened to me. And then you'd go sprawling, of course, and you could bring other riders down. Or they'd fall off and <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> down with them. And the cycle paths were often just compressed cinders, which got soft {{in the rain and}} got churned up by so many riders using them and then you got stuck and you lost your balance. And come what may, you got covered in coal dust and other muck. No, it's all changed and you can't compare then and now.|$|E

Buses on route 363 from Crystal Palace also pass near the entrance at an adjacent 'Crescent Wood Road' stop. The wood can also be reached from Sydenham Hill railway station.

25|$|Cunningham's cruiser {{squadron}} {{was asked}} to reinforce the Home Fleet under Admiral Sir Charles Forbes and assigned to the Norwegian campaign. He {{took part in the}} evacuation of allied troops from Namsos in May 1940 and the following month embarked King Haakon VII and his government ministers in Devonshire under orders to convey them to the United Kingdom. Shortly after his departure from Tromsø on this voyage, the aircraft carrier HMS Glorious and her two screening destroyers HMS Acasta and HMS Ardent were attacked and sunk on June 8 by Scharnhorst and Gneisenau; the thirty nine sailors who survived after two days on rafts in the cold sea were rescued by Norwegian ships making for the Faeroe Islands. The analysis of the action, supported by eyewitnesses from Devonshire, concludes that Glorious sent a sighting signal that was received only by Devonshire. Cunningham took steps to suppress the signal and continued on his way. According to a Norwegian history there were 461 passengers on board and Cunningham showed the signal to King Haakon who asked what his orders were: Cunningham replied, 'to <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> safely to England'. The King later remarked, 'I realised this was not to Admiral Cunningham's liking'. Cunningham was mentioned in despatches on 11 July 1940.|$|E
25|$|The {{town has}} a strong Non-conformist tradition, in 1672 a survey {{found that there were}} 400 Anglian conformists and 150 Non-conformists in Berkhamsted, when such beliefs could <b>bring</b> <b>you</b> foul of the law. The Baptist {{community}} in Berkhamsted, dates from 1640 {{making it one of the}} oldest nationally; first gathering in secret, they built a large chapel in 1722, and moved to their current place of worship at the junction of Ravens Lane on the High Street in 1864. A Quaker community is present in the town from the second half of the 17th century, they opened their Meeting House in 1818 on the High Street opposite St John's Well Lane. The Congregationlists can be traced back to 1780, they now worship combined with the Presbyterian church at St Andrew's United Reformed Church on the corner of Castle Street and Chapel Street. The Methodists arrived with the hundreds of men who came to build the railway, via various places of worship, today they share All Saints' Church with the Anglians. The Evangelist (Latter Day Saints) began life has part of the Plymouth Bretheren, their Hope Hall opened in 1875, which was rechristened the Kings Road Evangelical Church in 1969. The Roman Catholic tradition from the 17th to 20th century appears to be limited, General de Gaulle worshiped at their original Church of the Sacred Heart in Park View Road, they moved to a larger modern church in 1980 on Park Street.|$|E

500|$|As Harvey {{embarked}} on her solo career, she explored collaborations with other musicians. In 1995 she released her third studio album, To <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love, featuring former bandmate John Parish, Bad Seeds multi-instrumentalist Mick Harvey and French drummer Jean-Marc Butty, {{all of whom}} would continue to perform and record with Harvey throughout her career. The album was also her first material to be produced by Flood. Simultaneously a more blues-influenced and more futuristic record than its predecessors, To <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love showcased Harvey broadening her musical style to include strings, organs and synthesisers. Rolling Stone said in its review that [...] "Harvey sings the blues like Nick Cave sings gospel: with more distortion, sex and murder than you remember. To <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love was a towering goth version of grunge." [...] During the successive tours for the album, Harvey also experimented with her image and stage persona.|$|E

500|$|Aside from collaborations, Harvey {{has also}} {{embarked}} {{on a number of}} projects as a composer. In January 2009, a new stage production of Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler opened on Broadway.

500|$|She is {{also known}} for {{changing}} her physical appearance for each album by altering her mode of dress or hairstyle, creating a unique aesthetic that extends to {{all aspects of the}} album, from the album art to the live performances. She works closely with friend and photographer Maria Mochnacz to develop the visual style of each album. Around the time of To <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love, for example, Harvey began experimenting with her image and adopting a theatrical aspect to her live performances. Her former fashion style, which consisted of simple black leggings, turtleneck sweaters and Doc Martens boots, was replaced by ballgowns, catsuits, wigs and excessive make-up. She also began using stage props like a Ziggy Stardust-style flashlight microphone. She denied the influence of drag, Kabuki or performance art on her new image, a look she affectionately dubbed [...] "Joan Crawford on acid" [...] in an interview with Spin in 1996, but admitted that [...] "it's that combination of being quite elegant and funny and revolting, all at the same time, that appeals to me. I actually find wearing make-up like that, sort of smeared around, as extremely beautiful. Maybe that's just my twisted sense of beauty." [...] However, she later told Dazed & Confused magazine, [...] "that was kind of a mask. It was much more of a mask than I've ever had. I was very lost as a person, at that point. I had no sense of self left at all", and has never repeated the overt theatricality of the To <b>Bring</b> <b>You</b> My Love tour.|$|E
