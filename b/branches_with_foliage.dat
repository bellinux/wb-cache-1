The name {{eventually}} was Hispanicized to Cuernavaca. The coat-of-arms of the municipality is based on the pre-Columbian pictograph emblem of the city which depicts a tree trunk (cuahuitl) with three <b>branches,</b> <b>with</b> <b>foliage,</b> and four roots colored red. There is a cut in the trunk {{in the form of a}} mouth, from which emerges a speech scroll, probably representing the language Nahuatl and by extension the locative suffix [...] "-nāhuac", meaning [...] "near".|$|E
40|$|Recently, the {{red deer}} (Cervus elaphus) {{population}} has increased considerably and caused serious damage in forest stands in Slovakia {{as well as}} in other Central-European countries. Rowan (Sorbus aucuparia L.) is the tree species that is most intensively browsed and stripped by deer, especially during young stages of tree development. Our research focuses on estimating rowan mass consumption by red deer in young stands which developed after large-scale wind disturbance that occurred in the Tatra National Park in 2004. New models were developed for estimating the mass of tree components that are potentially edible by red deer using tree-base diameter as an independent variable. The results showed that the mass contribution of particular tree components to accessible deer forage depended on tree size (tree-base diameter). At stand level, total forage potential increased with an increase in tree size. However, whereas the quantity of bark available for stripping increased with tree size, the total mass accessible for browsing (leader shoot and <b>branches</b> <b>with</b> <b>foliage)</b> decreased. For instance, the contribution of stem bark to total forage potential in stands with a mean tree-base diameter of 20 mm and 50 mm was 15 % and 50 %, respectively. Theoretically, if all tree mass potential is consumed by red deer, young rowan stands (considering tree coverage of 50 %) growing within an area of 100 m 2 might provide sufficient forage for one adult deer for ca. 10 days. It is suggested that rowan species should not be removed from forest stands in territories with a high deer population in order to decrease the potential damage of other, commercially important, tree species. </p...|$|E
40|$|The Panel on Plant Health {{conducted}} a pest risk assessment for Liriomyza huidobrensis and Liriomyza trifolii in the European Union and identified and evaluated the phytosanitary measures listed in Council Directive 2000 / 29 /EC. Entry on the principal pathways (plants for planting, cut flowers and leafy vegetables) is assessed {{as likely as}} the pests are regularly associated with the pathways at origin, survival during transport or storage is high and only partially affected by current pest management procedures, {{and transfer to a}} suitable host is likely as their hosts are so widespread. Establishment is rated as very likely because both species have established populations in most countries of the EU, with transient populations occurring outdoors in non-Mediterranean areas. Spread within the EU is considered to be likely because the pests can readily be moved with plant material. The magnitude of the potential consequences is rated as minor for both species in Mediterranean areas. In non-Mediterranean countries it is moderate for both species in protected crops but, outdoors, impacts are minor for L. huidobrensis and minimal for L. trifolii. The current regulations to prevent entry and spread were found to be only partially effective as interceptions are still being made, cut <b>branches</b> <b>with</b> <b>foliage</b> and leafy vegetables other than celery are excluded, and the methods for inspection and the treatments required to confirm pest free areas, places of production and consignments are not clearly specified. Removal of the legislation would have some advantages and disadvantages but may not have a major effect. The regulations could be tightened by including additional commodities, clearly prescribing the inspection procedures and the appropriate treatments to be used and combining these with other measures, e. g. screening. The application of protected zones to areas where the pests are not yet present can be applied to help prevent further spread...|$|E

40|$|Summary Gas {{exchange}} {{was measured}} on a pruned Pinus radiata D. Don hedge and on a long-branch P. radiata tree near Hamilton, New Zealand, in spring 1993 when soil water con-tent was close to field capacity. Foliage {{at the end of}} long branches (9. 0 m) showed a marked drop in net photosynthetic rate and stomatal conductance as the saturation deficit in-creased, whereas foliage on short branches (0. 5 m) showed little change. Mean foliage d 13 C was- 30. 1 ‰ for short branches and- 26. 3 ‰ for long branches. Foliage d 13 C was correlated <b>with</b> <b>branch</b> length in two ge-netically improved P. radiata seedlots at four stocking densi-ties. The multinodal seedlot had shorter branches and more 13 C-depleted <b>foliage</b> compared <b>with</b> <b>branches</b> and <b>foliage</b> from the long internode seedlot. There was a strong effect of stock-ing density on carbon isotope composition in both seedlots.

50|$|The 4th-century mosaics on the {{ambulatory}} vault are contemporary {{with the}} building, and show {{a stark contrast}} to those in the apses, being essentially secular, with panels containing geometric patterns, small heads or figures within compartmented frames, birds <b>with</b> <b>branches</b> of <b>foliage,</b> vases and other objects, and vine patterns with cherubs harvesting and wine-making. This last type of scene also appears on Constantina's sarcophagus, as it does on the ends of the Sarcophagus of Junius Bassus. While the mosaics of the apses have very clear Christian imagery, those in the ambulatory are much more secular and could be considered Dionysiac with their images of grapes, fruit, birds, and mythological figures. This is especially true of the floor mosaics which were similar in style to those in the ambulatory, filled with cupids, birds, and Bacchus and grapevines. This shows the merging of pagan and Christian values in Rome. These mosaics probably represent the sort of decoration found in the Imperial palaces of the period, and in general have needed little restoration.|$|R

5000|$|Van Gogh {{completed}} {{two versions}} of the corner of Saint-Remy hospital gardens. Van Gogh was descriptive in a letter to Émile Bernard of the setting for these paintings: [...] "A view of the garden of the asylum where I am, on the right a gray terrace, a section the house, some rosebushes that have lost their flowers; on the left, the earth of the garden - red ochre - earth burnt by the sun, covered in fallen pine twigs. This edge of the garden is planted with large pines with red ochre trunks and <b>branches,</b> <b>with</b> green <b>foliage</b> saddened by a mixture of black. These tall trees stand out against an evening sky streaked with violet against a yellow background. High up, the yellow turns to pink, turns to green. A wall - red ocher again - blocks the view, and there’s nothing above it but a violet and yellow ochre hill. Now, the first tree is an enormous trunk, but struck by lightning and sawn off. A side branch, thrusts up very high, however, and falls down again in an avalanche of dark green twigs. This dark giant - like a proud man brought low - contrasts, when seen as the character of a living being, with the pale smile of the last rose on the bush, which is fading in front of him. Under the trees, empty stone benches, dark box. The sky is reflected yellow in a puddle after the rain. A ray of sun - the last glimmer - exalts the dark ocher to orange - small dark figures prowl here and there between the trunks." [...] "You’ll understand that this combination of red ochre, of green saddened with grey, of black lines that define the outlines, this gives rise a little to the feeling of anxiety from which some of my companions in misfortune often suffer, and which is called 'seeing red'." [...] And what’s more, the motif of the great tree struck by lightning, the sickly pink and green smile of the last flower of autumn, confirms this idea.|$|R
