60|$|Mr. Pendyce rode slowly; his feet, {{in their}} well-blacked boots, his nervous legs in <b>Bedford</b> <b>cord</b> and mahogany-coloured leggings, moved in rhyme to the horse's trot. A long-tailed coat fell clean and full over his thighs; {{his back and}} {{shoulders}} were a wee bit bent to lessen motion, and above his neat white stock under a grey bowler hat his lean, grey-whiskered and moustachioed face, with harassed eyes, was preoccupied and sad. His horse, a brown blood mare, ambled lazily, head raking forward, and bang tail floating outward from her hocks. And so, in the June sunshine, they went, all three, along the leafy lane to Worsted Scotton....|$|E

60|$|The farmer, who {{was indeed}} attired in a bowler hat and <b>Bedford</b> <b>cords,</b> {{continued}} to gaze over his land, unconscious of Mr. Lavender's presence.|$|R
5000|$|Because of its stiff construction, it {{is often}} used in {{upholstery}} or in outerwear that does not require draping. Trousers made with <b>Bedford</b> <b>cord</b> are sometimes called [...] "Bedford cords." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{trousers}} that Potter {{had worn}} on 14 February {{were described as}} being made from <b>Bedford</b> <b>cord.</b> There were two marks on the front that Professor Webster believed were blood stains; however, he {{reported that they had}} been cleaned too thoroughly for a positive analysis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bedford</b> <b>cord,</b> {{named after}} the town of Bedford in England, is a durable fabric that resembles corduroy. The weave has faint {{lengthwise}} ridges, but without the filling yarns that make the distinct wales characteristic of corduroy. It can have the appearance of narrow-width stripes with thin lines between.|$|E
6000|$|How {{long the}} next scene lasted, I could never tell. Salé {{was always trying}} to steal away with our canoe and leave the other four, {{probably}} for six hours, in an empty, leaky boat, without so much as an orange or a cocoanut on board, and under the direct rays of the sun. I had at last to stop him by taking the spare paddle off the outrigger and sticking it in the ground--depth, perhaps two feet--width of the bay, say three miles. At last I bid him land me and my mother and go back for the other ladies. [...] "The coast is so rugged," [...] said Salé.--"What?" [...] I said, [...] "all these villages and no landing-place?"--"Such is the nature of Samoans," [...] said he. Well, I'll find a landing-place, I thought; and presently I said, [...] "Now we are going to land there."--"We can but try," [...] said the bland Salé, with resignation. Never saw a better landing-place in my life. Here the boat joined us. My mother and Salé continued in the canoe alone, and Belle and I and Tauilo set off on foot for Malie. Tauilo was about the size of both of us put together and a piece over; she used us like a nurse with children. I had started barefoot; Belle had soon to pull off her gala shoes and stockings; the mud was as deep as to our knees, and so slippery that (moving, as we did, in Indian file, between dense scratching tufts of sensitive) Belle and I had to take hands to support each other, and Tauilo was steadying Belle from the rear. You can conceive we were got up to kill, Belle in an embroidered white dress and white hat, I in a suit of <b>Bedford</b> <b>cords</b> hot from the Sydney tailors; and conceive us, below, ink-black to the knees with adhesive clay, and above, streaming with heat. I suppose it was better than three miles, but at last we made the end of Malie. I asked if we could find no water to wash our feet; and our nursemaid guided us to a pool. We sat down on the pool side, and our nursemaid washed our feet and legs for us--ladies first, I suppose out of a sudden respect to the insane European fancies: such a luxury as you can scarce imagine. I felt a new man after it. But before we got to the King's house we were sadly muddied once more. It was 1 P.M. when we arrived, the canoe having beaten us by about five minutes, so we made fair time over our bog-holes.|$|R

5000|$|In 1893 a dress made of <b>Bedford</b> <b>cord</b> figured {{into the}} trial of Lizzie Borden. Various testimonies about [...] "the Bedford Cord" [...] gave {{conflicting}} ideas as to if the dress, which was burned by Borden after the murders of her father and stepmother, was stained by blood or by paint.|$|E
5000|$|Looms ran in {{the town}} from about 1850 until 2003. At one time the town had eleven mills, the last to be built being Progress Mill in 1915. On {{the lower part of}} Station Road [...] "The Last Loom" [...] of Kirkham is on {{permanent}} display. This loom, a crossrod type from the 1920s, with the use of tappets at the side, could produce an extensive range of fabrics including velvets, twills and <b>Bedford</b> <b>cord.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Daimler {{had always}} built {{their own bodies}} though as usual in that period to suit {{customers}} they provided {{a large number of}} chassis to external coach builders. In the second quarter of 1924 Daimler began building Weymann flexible framed fabric bodies for their [...] "natural silence, the entire absence of drumming and all those attributes which make for comfortable long-distance touring with a minimum of fatigue". Seats were Dryad basket-chairs of wicker button-quilted in <b>Bedford</b> <b>cord.</b> Daimler chose to name its Weymann bodies Construction Z.|$|E
50|$|The 66 and 68 were {{renamed the}} Dynamic 66 and 68 in 1948. The Dynamic 60 series were the {{smallest}} Oldsmobiles available and offered the greatest variety or body styles. Either 6-cylinder or 8-cylinder engines were available and were designated 66 or 68. Standard 60 Series equipment included: dual horns, dual sun visors and a cigarette lighter. The Deluxe equipment package added foam rubber seat cushions, Deluxe steering wheel, Deluxe instrument cluster, clock and chrome wheel trim rings. Standard tires were 6.00 x 16 inches. Upholstery was <b>Bedford</b> <b>cord</b> or broadcloth.|$|E

50|$|Optional extras were a luggage rack, chrome bumpers and Stevenson Jacking system. The {{upholstery}} was {{leather cloth}} with leather seating. The only known Super 9 to have <b>Bedford</b> <b>Cord</b> throughout is the prototype; this {{also has a}} smokers vent in the roof which is shown on brochures, but is not seen on any production 9’s. Instruments consisted of a speedometer, clock, oil gauge and ammeter. After 1931 a petrol gauge was added, prior to this a fuel tap was incorporated to give a reserve supply. Dash switches consisted of, a dash light, interior light, ignition, and a starter button, also choke and fast running control. External lights switching, battery charge rate, and ignition timing were all at {{the centre of the}} steering wheel.|$|E
