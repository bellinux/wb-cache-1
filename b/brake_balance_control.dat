40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} dc capacitor voltage <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy for cascade multilevel static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) and it also offers a general analytical method for <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy. The focus area of concern for this study starts {{with the development of}} imbalance of dc capacitor voltage. This imbalance arises due to non-uniformity of active power consumed by chain and absorbed by it. Thus, as a solution to this problem a <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy is discussed in this paper, which is based on Phase shift angle regulation. A general analytical method based on vector analysis is also presented. By this method of vector analysis the performance of Phase shift angle regulation <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy can be analysed, together with its regulation capacity. To find out the importance of applying <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy, a comparison assessment which is based on vector analysis between a system which is using <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy and a system which is devoid of any <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy is provided. This comparison comprehends that using <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy is much better for the system. Another inference of comparison is that <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy which is based upon Phase shift angle regulation, has the benefit of strong regulation capacity. After the comparison via vector analysis, the same comparison is done by using Simulink in MATLAB. The result of the simulations is the same as of vector analysis. The simulated data also verifies that application of a <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategy delivers better performance of cascade multilevel STATCOM rather than not using it.

40|$|Even though {{maintaining}} upright quiet stance {{might be}} considered by humans as a trivial task, it requires a complex <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> mechanism, in which sensory, nervous and muscle subsystems continuously cooperate and interchange environmental information to stabilize posture. Age, diseases and medication often degrade the related subsystems and affect <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> System redundancy in the closed-loop control system allows for corrections and, as such, certain <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> compensation strategies are employed by humans to regain stability. However, there are {{cases in which the}} compensation strategies are not sufficient, resulting in impaired human balance and increased risk of falling. Therefore, there is a need of an efficient model of human <b>balance</b> <b>control,</b> able to disentangle the underlying systems involved in standing balance and detect the primary source of <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> impairment. In the context of this study, first a multi-segmental human <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> model was developed, based on an experimental setup, which highly resembled <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> hazards encountered by humans in daily life. The model’s ability to describe the dynamics of the <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> subsystems and to quantify <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> parameters of physiological relevance was subsequently tested on simulated and experimental data, using system identification and parameter estimation techniques.

40|$|Maintaining {{dynamic balance}} is an {{important}} component of walking function that is likely impaired in chronic stroke survivors, evidenced by an increased prevalence of falls. Dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> requires maintaining the center of mass (COM) within the base of support during movement. During walking, dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> is achieved largely by modifying foot placement to adjust the base of support. However, chronic stroke survivors have difficulty with both precision control of foot placement, as well as reduced control of COM movement. The objective of this dissertation was to characterize dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> strategies during walking in chronic stroke survivors. Additionally, we evaluated whether altered sensory feedback could be used to improve <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> in stroke survivors. Dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> was characterized during challenging walking conditions in stroke survivors and age-matched neurologically intact individuals. Adaptations to perturbations in frontal plane COM, induced using a custom cable-driven device, were used to further probe mechanisms of dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> Despite larger amounts of COM movement and step widths, chronic stroke survivors produced a similar ratio of step width to COM sway, indicating that simply increasing step width does not produce a safer walking pattern for the stroke group. Placement of the paretic limb was unchanged in response to the external perturbations of trunk movement, which might underlie deficits in dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> Augmented sensory feedback improved paretic foot placement and COM control, when applied during a stepping or treadmill walking task. These results provide insight into differences in dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> in stroke while also demonstrating that augmented sensory feedback signals might be used to improve <b>balance</b> <b>control,</b> and thus walking function for chronic stroke survivors...|$|R
40|$|Deteriorated <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> is {{the most}} {{frequent}} cause of falls and injuries in the elderly. <b>Balance</b> <b>control</b> comprises a complex interplay of several underlying systems (ie, the sensory systems, the motor system, and the nervous system).

In addition, PD patients show a reduced ability to anticipate to self-induced disturbances, {{but it is not clear}} whether these anticipatory responses can be asymmetric too. Furthermore, it is not known how reactive <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> and anticipatory <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> are related in PD patients. Therefore, we investigated whether reactive and anticipatory <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> are asymmetric to the same extent in PD patients. 14 PD patients and 10 <b>controls</b> participated. Reactive <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> (RBC) was investigated by applying external platform and force perturbations and relating the response of the left and right ankle torque to the body sway angle at the excited frequencies. Anticipatory postural adjustments (APAs) were investigated by determining the increase in the left and right ankle torque just before the subjects released a force exerted with the hands against a force sensor. The symmetry ratio between the contribution of the left and right ankle was used to express the asymmetry in reactive and anticipatory balance control; the correlation between the two ratio's was investigated with Spearman's rank correlation coefficients. PD patients were more asymmetric in anticipatory (p = 0. 026) and reactive <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> (p = 0. 004) compared to controls and the symmetry ratios were significantly related (ρ = 0. 74; p = 0. 003) in PD patients.

40|$|Human bipedal {{balance is}} a complex {{sensorimotor}} task controlled by the central nervous system. Balance impairments, caused by aging or neuromuscular diseases, often lead to falls which {{are one of the}} leading causes of injury and subsequent increases in health care costs. Hence, understanding the mechanisms underlying human bipedal <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> has many functional and clinical implications. Traditionally, it was believed that <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> is mediated by subcortical structures. However, evidence from research {{in the past few decades}} has shown that the cerebral cortex plays a major role in bipedal <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> Nevertheless, the cortical contributions in <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> are still unclear. Hence, the purpose of this thesis was to extend the understanding of cortical involvement in human bipedal <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> Specifically, the two overarching goals of this thesis were to examine evidence of a cortical network involvement and its generalizability across reactive and predictive <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> These two overarching goals were addressed through four different studies. Study 1 explored the frequency characteristics and mechanisms underlying the generation of perturbation-evoked potentials. Study 2 investigated cortical activity linked to ‘automatic’ balance reactions that occur continuously while standing still and its dependence on the amplitude of these balance reactions. Study 3 examined the cortical activations related to the preparation and execution of anticipatory postural adjustments that precede a step and whether the activations are dependent on the context of control. Study 4 was designed to examine the functional connectivity in <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> and whether similar networks underlie reactive and predictive <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> Studies were conducted on young healthy adults and cortical activations were acquired using electroencephalography during feet-in-place balance reactions, standing still, and voluntary stepping. Overall, the findings of these studies provided direct and indirect evidence for the involvement of a cortical network in <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> and its generalizability across different classes of <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> This work reinforces the view that cortical networks likely play an important role in the control of stability. It is proposed that the synchronized activation of neural assemblies distributed across the cortex might have contributed to the balance-related cortical activations. The findings of this thesis extend the understanding of cortical control of human bipedal balance that may help to inform future, more precise models of the cortical contributions to <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> This, in turn, can inform future diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to improve mobility among those with balance impairments...|$|R

This could {{be caused by a}} lack of insight into the influence of orthoses on the underlying impairments. These impairments can be assessed with dual plate posturography to determine the relative contribution of each lower limb to <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> and weight-bearing. This study examined the effects of ankle-foot orthoses on functional balance, static and dynamic weight-bearing asymmetry and dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> of the paretic and non-paretic lower limbs. Methods Twenty stroke subjects (time since stroke 5 – 127 months) completed the study. Subjects were assessed with and without ankle-foot orthosis. Functional balance was assessed using the Berg Balance Scale, Timed Up & Go test, Timed Balance Test, 10 -m walking test and Functional Ambulation Categories. Weight-bearing asymmetry and dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> were assessed with force plates on a movable platform. Findings No significant effects of ankle-foot orthoses were found for weight-bearing asymmetry and dynamic <b>balance</b> <b>control,</b> but significant differences in favour of ankle-foot orthosis use were found for most functional tests. Interpretation Although ankle-foot orthoses had no effect on weight-bearing asymmetry or dynamic balance contribution of the paretic lower limb, functional tests were performed significantly better with orthoses.

To investigate the relationship among somatosensory function, <b>balance</b> <b>control,</b> and adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA. <b>Balance</b> <b>control</b> requires the contribution of somatosensory, visual, and vestibular inputs. Previous {{studies have shown that}} abnormal somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEPs) were associated with AIS. METHODS. A total of 105 girls with AIS and 57 normal girls aged 11 - 14 years entered the study, and were evaluated with bilateral tibial nerve evoked cerebral SSEPs and standing <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> under reduced or conflicting sensory conditions (i. e., the sensory organization test). One-way analysis of variance was conducted to evaluate the effects of scoliosis and somatosensory function tested by SSEPs on the performance of sensory organization test. RESULTS. There were 15 patients with AIS who had abnormal SSEPs. Postural sway was measured on all subjects under normal, reduced, or conflicting somatosensory, visual, and vestibular conditions. One-way analysis of variance indicated no significant effect of spinal deformity or SSEPs on the <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> when there was an increased reliance on the somatosensory, visual, and vestibular systems during stance (P > 0. 05). However, in the patients with abnormal SSEPs, a significant effect was found when subjects had to rely on somatosensory input for their <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> (P = 0. 023). The effect of scoliosis by itself was not found to be significant (P = 1. 0). CONCLUSIONS. The finding of significantly larger difference in bilateral SSEP latencies in patients with AIS indicated the association of abnormal SSEPs with AIS. The finding of a significant effect of SSEPs on the <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> further indicated the presence of abnormal somatosensory function in a subgroup of patients with AIS.

The objective {{in this study is}} to determine the individual contribution of the ankle torques generated by both legs in <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> during dynamic conditions. Methods Subjects (6 transfemoral and 8 transtibial amputees) stood on a force platform mounted on a motion platform and were instructed to stand quietly. The experiment consisted of 1 static and 3 perturbation trials of 90 s duration each. The perturbation trials consisted of continuous randomized sinusoidal platform movements of different amplitude in the sagittal plane. Weight distribution during the static and dynamic perturbation trials was calculated by dividing the average vertical force below the prosthesis foot by the sum of forces below both feet. The Dynamic <b>Balance</b> <b>Control</b> represents the ratio between the stabilizing mechanism of the prosthetic leg and the stabilizing mechanism of the non-amputated leg. The stabilizing mechanism is calculated from the corrective ankle torque in response to sway. The relationship between the prosthetic ankle stiffness and the performance during the platform perturbations was calculated. Findings All patients showed a (non-significant) weight bearing asymmetry in favor of the non-amputated leg. The Dynamic <b>Balance</b> <b>Control</b> ratio showed that the contribution of both legs to <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> was even more asymmetrical.

In contrast to existing approaches, this control strategy reduces the need to carry out complex computations in real time (replacing the iterated solution of quadratic optimization problems by a simple linear controller), and it does not require knowledge of a dynamic model of the robot. Therefore it can handle unforeseen changes in the dynamics of the robot that may arise for example from wind or other external forces. We demonstrate the feasibility of this novel approach to humanoid <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> through simulations of the humanoid robot HOAP- 2 for tasks that require <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> under disturbances by unknown external forces.

40|$|Statement of the problem: Balance {{impairments}} and falls are common {{among people with}} stroke. Muscle spasticity is also common and may influence <b>balance</b> <b>control.</b> However, the effect of spasticity on <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> among people with stroke is not well understood. Methods: Twenty-seven post-stroke individuals with low or high spasticity at the ankle completed quiet standing trials with eyes open and closed. <b>Balance</b> <b>control</b> was measured by estimating centre of pressure (COP) movement and trunk sway. Results: Individuals with high spasticity had greater COP velocity, trunk sway velocity, and trunk sway velocity frequency, particularly in the eyes closed condition. These effects were predominantly in the mediolateral direction (vision by group interaction effects p= 0. 033, p= 0. 037, and p= 0. 015 respectively). Main effect of group revealed that individuals with high spasticity had higher mediolateral mean power frequency measures (p= 0. 045). Conclusion: Individuals with high spasticity post-stroke demonstrated greater <b>balance</b> <b>control</b> challenges especially in absence of vision. Furthermore, these challenges were specifically noted in the frontal plane...|$|R
