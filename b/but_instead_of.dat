5|$|Instead {{of being}} sobered by their 3,000 casualties, Archduke John {{and his staff}} became {{convinced}} that the enemy was on the run. The Austrian general ordered a pursuit of the French through forested terrain. <b>But,</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> fleeing, Moreau and his troops {{were waiting for the}} Austrians.

5|$|Lichtenstein {{made several}} {{alterations}} {{to the source}} images as he compiled them into this composition. He used themes in this work that relate to those expressed in several of his other works.

5|$|The last {{sentence}} {{of the passage}} is similar to one from the Republican era Biography of Song Yue, Prince of E. <b>But</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> teaching them his own technique, it states Yue taught what he had learned from Zhou to his soldiers who were victorious in battle.|$|E

5|$|Yellow tea: This tea is {{processed}} {{in a similar}} manner to green tea, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> immediate drying after fixation, it is stacked, covered, and gently heated in a humid environment. This initiates oxidation in the chlorophyll of the leaves through non-enzymatic and non-microbial means, which results in a yellowish or greenish-yellow colour.|$|E
5|$|After a few skirmishes, the {{opposing}} forces met in earnest at Edgehill, on 23 October 1642. Charles's nephew Prince Rupert of the Rhine {{disagreed with the}} battle strategy of the royalist commander Lord Lindsey, and Charles sided with Rupert. Lindsey resigned, leaving Charles to assume overall command assisted by Lord Forth. Rupert's cavalry successfully charged through the parliamentary ranks, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> swiftly returning to the field, rode off to plunder the parliamentary baggage train. Lindsey, acting as a colonel, was wounded and bled to death without medical attention. The battle ended inconclusively as the daylight faded.|$|E
5|$|Being {{exceedingly}} {{alarmed at}} the misery into which I had fallen, {{and much more}} at that which threatened me in view of eternal death, I, duty bound, made it my first business to betake myself to your way, condemning my past life, not without groans and tears. And now, O Lord, what remains to a wretch like me, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> defence, earnestly to supplicate you not to judge that fearful abandonment of your Word according to its deserts, from which in your wondrous goodness you have at last delivered me.|$|E

5|$|Bouvet was {{the last}} member {{of a group of}} five battleships built to a broadly similar design, but {{different}} enough to be considered unique vessels. The first ship was , which formed the basis for Bouvet and three other ships. Design specifications were identical for each of the ships, but different engineers designed each vessel. The ships were based on the previous battleship , <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> mounting the main battery all on the centerline, the ships used the lozenge arrangement of the earlier vessel , which moved two of the main battery guns to single turrets on the wings. The five ships were built in response to the British s.|$|E
5|$|Brand {{testified in}} 1954 at the {{controversial}} libel trial in Jerusalem of Malchiel Gruenwald, who was sued by the Israeli government {{on behalf of}} Rezső Kasztner. Gruenwald was a Hungarian Holocaust survivor who had moved to Israel after the war. In a self-published pamphlet in 1952 he accused Kasztner, by then an Israeli civil servant, of having collaborated with the Nazis by dealing with Eichmann. Brand testified for Kasztner, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> defending him {{took the opportunity to}} accuse the Jewish Agency, whose officials became the first Israeli government, of having helped the British scupper the blood-for-goods proposal.|$|E

5|$|Flooding {{caused by}} Connie {{generally}} did not attract much media attention; however, the floods were important {{in setting the}} conditions for later significant flooding across the northeastern United States. Just five days after Connie struck North Carolina, Hurricane Diane affected the same area, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> continuing to the northwest it turned to the northeast. Diane produced further rainfall in already wet areas from Connie. Damage from Diane totaled at least $700million, and six states were declared federal disaster areas from the combined hurricanes' impact; this allowed federal assistance for the affected areas.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the game, Atlus decided to create a sequel, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> {{continuing}} to adapt Nishitani's work, they created an original story with an expanded narrative and refined gameplay. Titled , the game was released for the Famicom in 1990. Digital Devil Story: Megami Tensei was the first game in the Megami Tensei series, with Atlus eventually buying the rights to the franchise and turning the series into their most famous intellectual property. Megami Tensei has been called the third most popular RPG series in Japan after Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy, and gone on to include multiple subseries and expansions into other media.|$|E

A few plays later, Miami scored its first touchdown of the game. In the fourth quarter Miami finally took the lead on a 10-play, 70-yard drive. The Hokies were unable to answer the Hurricanes' score, and Miami won the 1966 Liberty Bowl, 147.|$|E

Ehlers' doctoral work was on the construction and characterization of solutions of the Einstein field equations. He earned his doctorate in physics from Hamburg University in 1958.|$|E
5|$|Long-range atomic {{exchange}} {{is a process}} involving an adatom inserting into the surface as in the normal atomic exchange mechanism, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> a nearest-neighbor atom it is an atom some distance further from the initial adatom that emerges.

In spite of this long range atomic exchange, as well as a variety of other exotic diffusion mechanisms, are anticipated to contribute substantially at temperatures currently too high for direct observation.|$|E

On 15 June he fought with the militia at Axminster, taking the town before the militias could join up. More recruits joined his disorganised force, which was now around 6,000, consisting mostly of nonconformists, artisans, and farm workers armed with farm tools (such as pitchforks). One famous supporter was the young Daniel Defoe.|$|E

Lansdale attempted to have his group exempted from this, but when he failed, Groves had Lansdale's unit reassigned to the Manhattan Project, creating a new Counter Intelligence Corps (CIC) unit within the Project. Groves had Lansdale transferred to the Manhattan District, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> placing him {{in charge of the}} new CIC unit, Groves made Lansdale his special assistant for security at Manhattan Project headquarters in Washington, D.C.
