25|$|The 2003 Saturn Ion quad coupe {{production}} car first {{appeared at the}} 2002 New York International Auto Show. The 2003 Ion came standard with a 2.2 L 140hp (104kW) DOHC Ecotec I4 engine. The Ion's instrument panel was mounted on the top center of the dashboard, rather than <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> The Ion is available in sedan level 1, 2, or 3; level three signified a more user friendly setup with power windows and power locks, while lower levels included crank windows and plastic wheel covers. Other extras included fog lights, sunroof, and spoiler. The Saturn Ion Quad Coupe has half-sized rear suicide doors while the sedan has conventionally hinged doors.|$|E
25|$|The Insight’s Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) {{provides}} infinite ratios to {{keep the}} engine operating within its most efficient range. Forward gear ratios are infinitely variable between 3.172–0.529 and reverse gear ranges from 4.511~1.693. Final drive is 4.20:1. On Insight EX models, paddle shifters mounted <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> allow the driver to engage a manual shift mode and select from seven simulated gear ratios for full control over acceleration and engine braking. Since the CVT’s gear ratios are continuously variable the system electronically directs the transmission to up- or downshift into pre-determined ratios when the driver taps the shift paddles. In normal driving, the CVT allows the engine and IMA motor {{to stay in their}} most efficient operating range thereby providing superior fuel efficiency to that of a conventional automatic transmission with fixed gear ratios. The CVT’s variable gear ratios allow for both quick, initial acceleration and efficient, low-rpm cruising.|$|E
500|$|... "Until It Beats No More" [...] is {{featured}} as background music in Lopez's commercial for the Fiat 500. The commercial, entitled [...] "My World", depicts Lopez leaving Manhattan and {{making her way}} to The Bronx, her hometown. Lopez is seen <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> of the car, gazing out at the scenery of The Bronx passing by. A voice-over says the words: [...] "Here, this is my world. This place inspires me to be tougher, to stay sharper, to think faster. They may be just streets to you but to me, they're a playground." ...|$|E

50|$|As a {{teenager}} Willi Weber trained his negotiating skills buying up worn military uniforms and selling those off to collectors. At {{the same time}} he was in an apprenticeship in hotel management in order to learn the business with the target to run his own gastronomic establishment. He succeeded as an entrepreneur with his businesses being based near Stuttgart, Germany, and became a wealthy man with franchises.As a motorsport fan he spent time and good part of his wealth <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> of race cars. In 1983 engineer Klaus Trella talked Weber into a partnership and they founded their Formula 3 team WTS (Weber-Trella Stuttgart). Realising that he wasn't a front-runner on the track, Weber made room for ambitious youngsters, and enjoyed his status as team owner. The first success came in 1988 with talented Swabian driver Joachim Winkelhock who won the team's first German F3 Championship title.|$|R
50|$|Federal {{prohibition}} officers arranged {{an undercover}} purchase of liquor from George Carroll, an illicit dealer under investigation, but the transaction was not completed. They later saw Carroll and one Kiro {{driving on the}} highway from Detroit to Grand Rapids, Michigan, which they regularly patrolled. They pursued, pulled them over, and searched the car, finding illegal liquor <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> rear <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Mechanically, the Mk III C's {{transmission}} {{was a major}} improvement {{from the}} older car. [...] A new 6-speed gearbox built by X-Trac {{was part of the}} package, replacing the previous 5-speed. [...] This gearbox was further enhanced by the option of a pneumatically actuated gear change system developed by Megaline which was activated by paddles <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> rather than by a traditional gear stick.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{generation}} Gallardo came {{with an even}} firing 5 litre 90 degree V10 (4961cc). The Gallardo offers two choices of transmissions, a conventional (H-Box) six-speed manual transmission, and an advanced six-speed electro-hydraulically controlled semi-automatic robotized manual, which Lamborghini abbreviates to [...] "E-gear". The [...] "E-gear" [...] allows the driver to make shifts much faster than they could with a manual transmission. The driver shifts up and down via paddles <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> but can also change to an automatic mode. The vehicle was designed by Luc Donckerwolke and {{was based on the}} 1995 Calà prototype by Italdesign Giugiaro.|$|E
2500|$|The {{transmission}} is a dual-clutch direct-shift gearbox computer-controlled automatic with seven gear ratios, with magnesium paddles <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and a shift time {{of less than}} 150milliseconds, built by Ricardo of England rather than Borg-Warner, who designed the six speed DSG used in the mainstream Volkswagen Group marques. The Veyron can be driven in either semi-automatic or fully automatic mode. A replacement transmission for the Veyron costs just over [...] It also has permanent all-wheel drive using the Haldex Traction system. It uses special Michelin PAX run-flat tyres, designed specifically to accommodate the Veyron's top speed, and cost [...] per set. The tyres [...] can be mounted on the wheels only in France, a service which costs [...] Kerb weight is [...] This gives the car a power-to-weight ratio, according to Volkswagen Group's figures, of [...] per ton.|$|E
60|$|The {{accident}} {{had occurred}} at a point about one hundred yards from where Pat and Sparrer were about to emerge from a thicket of bushes lining the drive and {{at the sound of}} the crash they sprang out. An instant later a big roadster tore past and they caught a fleeting glimpse of a strained white face <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> big <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and beyond, partly raised and half turned to look back, a fur-coated figure, evidently that of a young man. For just a second his face turned toward them, then hastily turned away. But that brief glimpse was enough to show them that it bore the stamp of guilty fear.|$|R
40|$|The {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the medial constructs and images of the motor racing in der popular culture of the Third Reich. The images of the victorious racing drivers and triumphant German technology in films, books or newspapers came {{together to form a}} powerful mental construct that reinforced national self-confidence. Bernd Rosemeyer or Rudolf Caracciola, the drivers from the German automotive companies Auto Union and Mercedes-Benz, became modern masculine heroes. <b>Behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheels</b> of fast and powerful machines, they represented a strong, modern, and capable industrial nation, which - in the discourse of the time - as an organically grown and socially classless community of German workers (2 ̆ 2 Volksgemeinschaft, 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Werkmänner 2 ̆ 2) never lost its roots to tradition, history and the virtues of workmanship and handmade, high-quality-products (2 ̆ 2 Deutsche Wertarbeit 2 ̆ 2). The 2 ̆ 2 motor battles 2 ̆ 2 (2 ̆ 2 Motorenschlachten 2 ̆ 2) at the Avus in Berlin and the Nürburgring were more popular than the usual mass party rallies of the Nazis in Nuremberg or other cities. In comparison to the stiff rituals there, the marching uniformed, disciplined bodies and the ideologically unequivocal acclamation of the total hegemony of one party, car races were a demonstration of the joy of life. They manifested the so-called 2 ̆ 2 Volksgemeinschaft 2 ̆ 2 as a national community of joy and fun. Motor sport as a mass media construct moreover shows the effective strategy of the Nazis and the significance of modernity...|$|R
2500|$|Drive output {{passes through}} a {{modified}} ZF 6HP26A six-speed tiptronic automatic transmission. The parts code 9is 09E and the identification code is KZQ or KZH. The gear ratios are: 1st: 4.171, 2nd: 2.340, 3rd: 1.521, 4th: 1.143, 5th: 0.867, 6th: 0.691, with shortened shift times, with [...] "Dynamic Shift Programme" [...] (DSP) and [...] "Sport" [...] mode. [...] It has paddle-shifts mounted <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> flat-bottomed <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> similar in design to the Audi B7 RS 4. [...] The gearbox is set by default, in conventional automatic mode, to delay up-changes during acceleration, and change down earlier to maximise engine braking. [...] Downchanges in all modes of operation include the Powertrain Control Module electronic control unit (ECU) [...] "blipping" [...] the Bosch [...] "E-Gas" [...] drive by wire throttle, for smoother shift changes. [...] The hydraulic torque converter includes a lock-up function in all forward gears, {{and is able to}} completely disconnect when the vehicle is stationary, thus saving fuel.|$|R
2500|$|To commemorate its {{passing the}} Ford Model T's record sales mark and its {{victories}} in the Baja 1000 Mexican races from 1967 to 1971, Volkswagen produced its first limited-edition Beetle. It was marketed as the [...] "Baja Champion SE" [...] in the United States and the [...] "Marathon" [...] Superbeetle {{in the rest of}} the world. It featured unique [...] "Marathon Blau" [...] metallic blue paint, steel-pressed 10-spoke 15-inch (38cm) magnesium-alloy wheels, a commemorative metal plate mounted on the glovebox and a certificate of authenticity presented to the original purchaser. Dealer-installed options for this limited-edition Superbeetle included the following: white stripes running the length of the rocker-panel, a special shifter knob, bumper overriders, tapered exhaust tips, fake walnut inserts in the dashboard (<b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and the glovebox cover) as well as Bosch fog lights mounted on the front bumper.|$|E
2500|$|The Aura XR was the {{top-line}} Aura model. The XR {{was fitted}} with the 3.6L DOHC V6 with VVT, rated at [...] at 6200 rpm and [...] of torque at 3100 rpm. [...] This engine {{was first used}} in the Cadillac CTS {{as well as the}} Cadillac STS and marks its third use in a North American GM car. [...] With this 3.6L engine, the Aura was the first front-wheel drive GM passenger car to use the new Hydra-Matic 6T70 six-speed automatic transmission. The transmission featured TAPshift, which allowed the driver to manually select gears by using paddles located <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> [...] The Aura XR was the performance-oriented version with a taut, but not harsh, suspension and the more powerful engine. [...] Available interior colors in the XR were tan and grey leather (available in the XE), along with the XR-specific black or Morocco Brown leather. [...] Cloth was standard. [...] Other standard features included the Advanced Audio Package, 18inch alloy wheels, chrome exterior door handles, and remote vehicle start. Given the 2007 Saturn AURA's European roots—the car's chassis was also used for the Saab 9-3. The Aura also used hydraulic power steering (V-6 models only) that provided more feedback and a more linear feel than the fussy electric power-assist units. For 2009, an entry level XR became available. [...] It included the 17 inch 10 spoke alloy wheels available on the XE and the 2.4 L LE5 Ecotec engine mated to GM's all new 6T40 6-speed automatic transmission with TAPshift. [...] The 3.6L VVT with 18" [...] wheels was optional.|$|E

2500|$|While 250 GT Lusso was {{a civilized}} sport car, it was {{nevertheless}} [...] "recommended in preference to young and flexible passengers" [...] {{due to the}} fixed-position seatbacks. Despite this, the pedals were adjustable to , as in the racing versions. The design of the instrument panel, covered with soft and black leather was unusual; the tachometer, with a red zone beginning at 8,000rpm, and the speedometer were placed at the center slightly tilted towards the driver. [...] Five additional gauges were positioned in front of <b>the</b> driver, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> three-spoke Nardi <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> made of wood and aluminum, placed almost vertically.|$|R
50|$|A higher {{steering}} ratio means that <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned {{more to get}} the wheels turning, {{but it will be}} easier to turn <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> A lower <b>steering</b> ratio means that <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned less to get the wheels turning, but it will be harder to turn <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Larger and heavier vehicles will often have a higher {{steering ratio}}, which will make <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> easier to turn. If a truck had a low steering ratio, it would be very hard to turn <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> In normal and lighter cars, the wheels are easier to turn, so <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> ratio doesn't have to be as high. In race cars the ratio is typically very low, because the vehicle must respond to steering input much faster than in normal cars. <b>The</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is therefore harder to turn.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{automotive}} <b>steering</b> {{column is}} a device intended primarily for connecting <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> mechanism or transferring the driver's input torque from <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{driver was}} {{situated}} on heightened seat <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> while the passenger's seat was much {{lower on the}} frame, so his legs were sticking out under the car.|$|E
5000|$|... 1969: Saab {{creates an}} {{ignition}} system near the gearstick - instead of <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> like most cars - {{in an attempt}} to reduce the very common serious and permanent knee injuries during collisions, caused by the knee impacting the key.|$|E
50|$|The {{six-speed}} transaxle gearbox has computerized {{gear selection}} {{by means of}} levers <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and {{may be used in}} Manual-Normal; Manual-Sport; Automatic-Normal; Automatic-Sport and Wet modes. The gearbox can shift in 175 milliseconds when using Sport mode. The 8C also has a limited slip differential.|$|E
50|$|There are two wheels, {{the larger}} driving wheel for {{travelling}} in a forward direction, and a trailing <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and 90 degrees to this one. Both the drive <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> however are constructed of multiple smaller 'planet' wheels {{that allow the}} wheel to be moved laterally. When moving forward the main wheel will be powered and the smaller planet <b>wheels</b> on <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> will rotate to avoid <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> dragging. To turn <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is rotated. To balance from side to side, or to self-balance laterally, the planet wheels on the drive wheel will be powered appropriately.|$|R
50|$|The first button {{added to}} <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was a switch to {{activate}} the car's electric horn. Traditionally located on <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> hub or center pad, the horn switch was sometimes placed on the spokes or activated via a decorative horn ring which obviated the necessity to move a hand away from the rim. Electrical connections are made via a slip ring. A further development, <b>the</b> Rim Blow <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> integrated <b>the</b> horn switch into <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> rim.|$|R
50|$|Also {{known as}} a crook lock, or club lock, the first {{generation}} of steering-wheel locks, known as canes, consisted of a lockable bar that connected <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to <b>the</b> brake pedal or clutch pedal. Later models include devices which are even more visible as they lock across <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and extend out over the dashboard to prevent <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> being turned.|$|R
50|$|Similar to the California, 458 Italia, FF and LaFerrari, the F12berlinetta transmits {{power through}} a 7-speed dual-clutch {{automated}} semi-automatic gearbox {{operated by the}} driver using paddle shifters <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> Compared to similar models, the F12berlinetta uses shortened gear ratios to match {{the power of the}} engine.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} of the new Civic likewise features major design changes. Unlike the split bi-level speedometer and tachometer of its predecessor, the tenth generation Civic consolidates these instruments into a fully customisable, all digital interface incorporating a 7-inch LCD screen positioned directly <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and in the driver's line of sight.|$|E
5000|$|A further upgrade {{took place}} in 1968. The {{instrument}} panel and steering wheel were redesigned. [...] The large speedometer previously positioned <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{was replaced by a}} horizontal row of four circular dials/displays of varying detail and complexity according to the model specified. [...] The right-hand dial, the speedometer, was now {{to one side of the}} driver's normal sightline, while one multi-functional stalk on the right side of the steering column replaced the two control stalks that had been directly <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> one on each side. [...] The earlier Imp had been praised for the good ergonomic quality of its dash-board/fascia, and its replacement reflected similar trends in other new and modified UK vehicles at a time of [...] "production rationalization". On the Imp, the more modern arrangement was seen by some as a missed opportunity.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>steering</b> {{ratio is}} <b>the</b> {{ratio of the}} number of degrees of turn of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to <b>the</b> number of degrees the wheel(s) turn as a result. In motorcycles, delta {{tricycles}} and bicycles, <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> ratio is always 1:1, because <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> is fixed to <b>the</b> front <b>wheel.</b> A <b>steering</b> ratio of x:y means that a turn of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> x degree(s) causes the wheel(s) to turn y degree(s). In most passenger cars, the ratio is between 12:1 and 20:1. For example, if one complete turn of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> 360 degrees, causes the wheels to turn 24 degrees, the ratio is then 360:24 = 15:1.|$|R
50|$|Without {{mechanical}} {{connection between}} <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> and <b>the</b> road wheel, {{it is less}} likely {{that the impact of}} a frontal crash will force <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to intrude into the driver's survival space.|$|R
5000|$|In a head-on {{collision}} accident in 2007 that demolished her truck, she escaped serious injury by [...] "pushing <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{away from her}} body as the crash occurred, leaving <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> broken and crumpled." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{driver was}} faced by a {{steering}} wheel linked to its central boss by {{three sets of}} four thin spoke like rods. The design of the steering wheel, reminiscent of the early Porsches, ensured minimal disruption of {{the view of the}} instruments behind it. Also <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> was the column-mounted gear lever.|$|E
50|$|Branca competed at a {{lower level}} until the mid-1950s, racing in hillclimbs and participated twice in the 24 Hours of Le Mans race. Racing with a Moretti 750cc, in 1955 the car was not ready {{and could not be}} brought to the {{starting}} line {{at the time of the}} start, and in 1956 the car broke down before his turn <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|Citroën {{produced}} {{a number of}} variants on semi-automatic transmission. The Citroën DS, introduced in 1955, used a hydraulic system to select gears and operate the conventional clutch using hydraulic servos. There was also a speed controller and idle speed step-up device, all hydraulically operated. This allowed clutchless shifting with a single selector mounted <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> This system was nicknamed 'Citro-Matic' in the U.S.|$|E
40|$|A <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> has a ring portion, spoke {{portions}} and a hub portion. <b>The</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> {{is provided}} with a thermoelectric reversible heat pump to heat or cool a fluid. A closed hydraulic circuit includes a hydraulic pump {{and at least one}} duct extending along the ring portion of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> <b>The</b> fluid is heated or cooled by the thermoelectric heat pump and is circulated by the hydraulic pump within the ring portion of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> to heat or cool the ring portion...|$|R
50|$|The new S-Class has touch-sensitive {{controls}} in <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> They respond to swiping motions like {{the screen of}} a smartphone and enable the driver to control the entire infotainment system without having to take their hands off <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} tilt wheel {{was developed}} by Edward James Lobdell in the early 1900s. A 7-position tilt wheel was introduced by the Saginaw Division of General Motors in 1963 for all passenger car divisions except Chevrolet which received the tilt wheel in 1964. This tilt wheel was also supplied to the other US automakers (except Ford). [...] Originally a luxury option on cars, the tilt function helps to adjust <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> by moving <b>the</b> wheel through an arc in an up and down motion. Tilt <b>Steering</b> <b>Wheels</b> rely upon a ratchet joint located in <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> column just below <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel.</b> By disengaging <b>the</b> ratchet lock, the wheel can be adjusted upward or downward while <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> column remains stationary below the joint. Some designs place the pivot slightly forward along the column, allowing for {{a fair amount of}} vertical movement of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with little actual tilt, while other designs place the pivot almost inside <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel,</b> allowing adjustment of the angle of <b>the</b> <b>steering</b> <b>wheel</b> with almost no change it its height.|$|R
