5|$|Drivers can {{get away}} with this rule-breaking due to their paper-based log books. As a driver records their time spent <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> there is very little to stop them from forging their log books. There is very {{superficial}} oversight and some drivers take advantage of this fact. Surveys indicate that between 25% and 75% of drivers violate the HOS. Other drivers maintain more than one log book, showing falsified versions to enforcement officers.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} lesser known {{details about the}} Wreck that are easily missed when it rambles down Techwood Drive. Specific {{physical}} details and the actual person <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> are often missed or overlooked. The Wreck is financially maintained through Ramblin' Reck Club appearances and fundraisers. There is no official source of funding from the Institute, Athletic Association, or Alumni Association. This gives the Wreck a unique level of independence that is atypical amongst college mascots.|$|E
5|$|Three days later, on September 23, 1970, {{the group}} robbed {{a bank in}} Brighton, Massachusetts, {{carrying}} handguns, a shotgun and a submachine gun. The first police officer on the scene, Boston police officer Walter Schroeder, {{was shot in the}} back by Gilday when he attempted to stop the robbery. He subsequently died from his wounds. The group escaped with $26,000 in cash that they planned to use to finance an overthrow of the federal government.

5|$|Speed Racer is an 18-year-old {{whose life}} and love has always been {{automobile}} racing. His parents Pops and Mom run the independent Racer Motors, in which his brother Spritle and his pet monkey Chim Chim, mechanic Sparky, and girlfriend Trixie are also involved. As a child Speed idolized his record-setting older brother, Rex Racer, who was killed while racing in the Casa Cristo 5000 (AKA The Crucible), a deadly cross-country racing rally. Now embarking on his own career, Speed Racer is quickly sweeping the racing world with his skill <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> of his brother's cars, the Mach 5 and his own Formula One car the Mach 6, but remains primarily interested {{in the art of}} the race and the well-being of his family.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1991 season, Zerex {{ended their}} {{sponsorship}} of Kulwicki's team. Junior Johnson came calling again, {{looking for a}} driver for his revived second team that had last seen Neil Bonnett <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> in 1986. Kulwicki turned down Johnson's $1 million offer thinking that he had secured a sponsorship deal with Maxwell House Coffee. Johnson then went to Maxwell House himself and obtained the sponsorship for his new car, which Sterling Marlin was hired to drive instead. Kulwicki was forced to begin the season without a sponsor, paying all of the team's expenses {{out of his own}} pocket. At the opening race of the season, the 1991 Daytona 500, fivecars raced with paint schemes representing different branches of the United States military to show support for the American forces involved in the Gulf War. It was the first use of special paint schemes in NASCAR history. Kulwicki's car was sponsored by the United States Army in a one-race deal. After running the second and third races of the season in a plain white unsponsored car, Kulwicki's luck finding a sponsor changed for the better at Atlanta Motor Speedway.|$|E

5|$|The next morning, on 24 December 1972, two {{tracking}} teams {{arrived at}} Whistlefield to assist Buttenshaw and Sachse in a 360-degree search: one {{was from the}} SAS, and led by Ron Marillier, while {{the other was a}} British South Africa Police (BSAP) team including tracking dogs. The security forces searched for tracks while also investigating reported sightings. The tracks of the ZANLA fighters were discovered on 27 December on the western side of the farm and the trackers asked Buttenshaw and Sachse to bring the vehicles carrying the heavy equipment around to meet them. On the way the truck carrying Buttenshaw ran over a mine with one of its rear wheels, causing it to detonate. Buttenshaw himself, who was sitting on the bonnet of the vehicle, was thrown clear but Corporal Norman Moore and Trooper Pete Botha, sitting in the back, were not as fortunate, taking the brunt of the blast. Captain Gordon Holloway, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel,</b> and Trooper Rod Boden in the passenger seat went into severe shock but were ultimately unharmed. Moore, on the other hand, died two days later from his wounds, while Botha survived but lost both legs.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Rihanna walking towards a white Jeep Wrangler, but stops {{due to her}} mobile phone ringing. As Rihanna answers, she converses with a male friend, presumably her boyfriend. As she tells him {{that she needs to}} do some things before meeting with him, Rihanna hangs up and the screen cuts to a black screen. As a visual of Rihanna driving along a bridge in the Florida Keys, the song begins to play. During the first verse, {{different}} scenes are intercut of Rihanna, including a close-up shot of the singer driving <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> is shown, walking along the beach and dancing in a black dress against a white backdrop, as she sings about how her boyfriend has been seeing another girl without Rihanna knowing. For the first chorus, in addition to the other three scenes, one shot is shown of Rihanna dancing with a man in a nightclub. During the second verse, Rihanna is shown lying down on the beach and playing in the water, as well as dancing with a male dancer against a white backdrop, this time wearing a lace dress.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Peter, Quagmire and Joe discuss killing Jeff, with Joe (as {{a police}} officer), {{against the idea}} saying that Quagmire could be arrested for murder and it doesn't matter, while Quagmire says that it does and {{explains}} that people like Jeff never change. Joe is still against the idea but when the trio witness an infuriated Jeff severely attack Brenda for simply changing the channel on Quagmire's TV, he renounces his hesitance and agrees to murder him. The three decide to talk Jeff into a hunting trip {{in an attempt to}} kill him, and make it look like an accident. Having expected it, however, Jeff reveals his own gun, and knocks Peter and Joe out so that he can kill Quagmire in a deeper part of the woods. Once there, Quagmire talks Jeff into fighting him instead, during which Quagmire is seemingly strangled to death. Jeff then goes to dig a grave to put Quagmire's body in, until he sees an angry Quagmire, alive and well, <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheel</b> of Peter's car. Quagmire reveals that he chokes himself everyday and kills Jeff by running him over, smashing his head into a tree with the car. Peter, Joe and Quagmire return home the next day, and present Brenda with a forged note from Jeff stating that he has decided to leave her. As Brenda breaks down in tears over Jeff, Peter notes that he wishes he could kill someone else and gets an idea about Mort before the episode ends.|$|E

30|$|With the {{development}} of robotics, the autonomous mobile robot has been widely used [1, 2]. Intelligent [3, 4], high pass [5] and large load-ratio [6] robots have been gradually regarded as an important developing factor for the engineering of mobile robots.

In the aspect of theoretical research and practical application, the legged robots relatively lag <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheeled</b> ones [8], and the legged robots fall <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheeled</b> ones in depth and lack an extensive degree of research, especially the heavy-duty multi-legged robots. The technology parameters of the heavy-duty multi-legged robots, such as BigDog [9], Ambler [10], ATHLETE [11, 12], and Dante II [13], concludes that the heavy-duty multi-legged robots have three major characteristics comparing to the non-heavy-duty or small multi-legged robots; they are the larger volume, bigger mass, and larger load to mass ratio [14].|$|R
