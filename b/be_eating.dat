The Gate reappears and the two leave Snow White's world, following the light back to their world, which leads them to Erika. Rei questions why they would leave her behind, but then realizes it must be because she is not the Seventh Princess.|$|E

25|$|Psychiatric and {{emotional}} consequences can be apparent immediately after rape {{and it may}} be necessary to treat these very early in the evaluation and treatment.

Professional counseling and on-going treatment by trained health care providers is often sought by the victim.|$|E
500|$|American kestrels are bred {{in captivity}} {{for use in}} falconry, and are among the easier falcons to breed. [...] They are also {{sufficiently}} common that [...] "passage" [...] birds {{in their first year}} are relatively easy to trap. [...] Wild caught kestrels [...] "tame down" [...] fairly quickly. [...] They will usually <b>be</b> <b>eating</b> from a falconer's hand the day after capture, be training within a week, and be ready to hunt in three to five weeks. [...] A very tame American kestrel will allow itself to be picked up around the body with one hand, while accepting tidbits from the other hand. Such tameness is very useful when checking or treating the bird for injury or illness.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} {{positive to}} mixed reviews. Writing for Entertainment Weekly, critic Ken Tucker noted and appreciated that [...] "many key details {{were provided by}} characters who don’t often serve that function", such as with Broyles and the numbers stations. He called it [...] "a terrific, almost Astrid-centric episode." [...] Los Angeles Times writer Andrew Hanson enjoyed the episode's many puzzles and expressed appreciation for the [...] "First People" [...] revelation as well as Walternate's [...] "long con" [...] concerning the doomsday device. Hanson was skeptical that Peter had not yet figured out Fauxlivia's true identity, but praised Anna Torv's performance ("Anyone who doubted [...] acting chops in {{the first couple of}} seasons should <b>be</b> <b>eating</b> their words").|$|E

500|$|In round 4 Hunt had a 20-possession display against Brisbane.

[...] Hunt continued to contribute to his side with a 22-disposal display against Fremantle in round 6 that included a goal. [...] Going into round 7, Greater Western Sydney coach Kevin Sheedy commented that the in form Hunt, rather than star player Ablett was the key threat in the match and would assign defensive taggers to him. Despite another consistent 16 disposal game, Hunt struggled to break the tag and some media commentators suggested {{that he had been}} outperformed by fellow league to Aussie Rules convert Israel Folau.|$|E

2500|$|Dining {{etiquette}} in Korea can {{be traced}} back to the Confucian philosophies of the Joseon period. Guidebooks, such as Sasojeol (士小節, Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (이덕무; 李德懋), comment on the dining etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as [...] "when you see a fat cow, goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it", [...] "when you are having a meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or diarrhea," [...] "when eating a meal, neither eat so slowly as to appear to <b>be</b> <b>eating</b> against your will nor so fast as if to be taking someone else's food. Do not throw chopsticks on the table. Spoons should not touch plates, making a clashing sound", amongst many other recommendations which emphasized proper table etiquette.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{the end of}} 2009 {{when the}} {{government}} began soliciting expert opinion for the Animal Protection Act, the focus of public debate has always been on whether one should <b>be</b> <b>eating</b> cats or not, or whether cat-eating is a Chinese tradition or not. There are even people who would {{go as far as}} to say that the call to stop eating cat meat is [...] "imposing the will of the minority on the majority". Yet the [...] "majority" [...] does not understand the complete truth of cat-meat trading chains: cat theft, cat trafficking, killing cats, selling cats, and eating cats, all the various stages of the trade and how they are distributed across the country, in cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Rugao, Wuhan, Guangzhou, and Hebei. This well-organized, smooth-running industry chain of cat abuse, cat killing and skinning has already existed among ordinary Chinese folks for 20 years, or perhaps even longer.|$|E

With ten laps {{to go in the}} event, the Busches were racing against each other, their cars made contact; eventually their contact resulted in the two crashing out of contention to win. Kevin Harvick went by to win the event; but the center of the attention and media was on Kurt and Kyle's feud. Kyle and Kurt were livid with each other in the post-race ceremonies, and were arguing on pit road. When Kurt was interviewed he stated he [...] "wasn't going to <b>be</b> <b>eating</b> any Kellogg's [...] soon", and said that Kyle was fighting dirty. When Kyle was interviewed he said that he wanted to cleanly get by Kurt and that Kurt shoved up his car for no reason.
