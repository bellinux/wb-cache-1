5|$|Upheaval {{within the}} band {{occurred}} from 1983 onwards. First Bill McDonough left, then his brother Guy McDonough died in 1984, then various other members left. Their 1985 release Between a Rock and a Hard Place was expensive but sales were disappointing; and they disbanded early in 1986. The band's {{status as an}} icon on the Australian music scene was acknowledged <b>by</b> <b>induction</b> into the 1996 Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) Hall of Fame. Founding guitarist Brad Robinson was unable to attend the Hall of Fame induction in person, as he was hospitalised with lymphoma and died two weeks later.|$|E
5|$|The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York honors {{individuals}} who have excelled in playing, managing, and serving the sport, and is the central point {{for the study of}} the history of baseball in the United States and beyond, displaying baseball-related artifacts and exhibits. Elections of worthy individuals to be honored <b>by</b> <b>induction</b> into the hall of fame commenced in 1936, although the first induction ceremonies were not held until the hall opened in 1939. Through the elections for , a total of 319 people have been inducted, including 220 former major league players, 32 executives, 35 Negro League players and executives, 22 managers, and 10 umpires. Each is listed showing his primary position; that is, the position or role in which the player made his greatest contribution to baseball according to the Hall of Fame.|$|E

25|$|In this way, {{the problem}} of {{induction}} is not only concerned with the uncertainty of conclusions derived <b>by</b> <b>induction,</b> but doubts the very principle through which those uncertain conclusions are derived.|$|E

25|$|The modern {{formulation}} of proof <b>by</b> <b>induction</b> was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it implicit {{in some of}} Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes.|$|E
25|$|Control of an operon {{is a type}} of gene {{regulation}} that enables organisms to regulate the expression of various genes depending on environmental conditions. Operon regulation can be either negative or positive <b>by</b> <b>induction</b> or repression.|$|E
25|$|A multi{{dimension}}al {{case can}} be proved <b>by</b> <b>induction</b> on the dimension of a simplex. We apply the same reasoning, as in the two-dimensional case, to conclude that in a n-dimensional triangulation there is an odd number of full-colored simplices.|$|E
