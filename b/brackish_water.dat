5|$|The species easily {{attaches}} {{itself to}} stones, which {{allows it to}} live in fast-running waters and in wave zone in lakes. The ability of Theodoxus fluviatilis to live in freshwater and also in <b>brackish</b> <b>water</b> demonstrates the phenotypic plasticity of this species. This small snail can live in up to 60 m depth in coastal waters. <b>Brackish</b> <b>water</b> populations can live in salinities of up to 15‰ in the Baltic Sea or up to 18‰ in the Baltic Sea and in Black Sea. Populations from <b>brackish</b> <b>water</b> can tolerate higher salinity than populations from freshwater. <b>Brackish</b> <b>water</b> populations have much higher accumulation of ninhydrin-positive substances in the foot.|$|E

5|$|The {{shell of}} Theodoxus fluviatilis is {{somewhat}} depressed (with an usually low spire), strongly calcified, and has 3–3.5 whorls (including the protoconch). Larger specimens are usually eroded. The width {{of an adult}} shell is usually 5–9mm, but can reach up to 11–13mm. The height of the shell is 4–6.5mm, or up to 7mm. These mean values vary among populations depending on the environment: the maximum width of the shell of <b>brackish</b> <b>water</b> populations is 9.3mm. <b>Brackish</b> <b>water</b> shells are somewhat shorter, reaching up to 5.8mm, and the maximum weight of the shell is 124mg. In freshwater populations, the maximum recorded shell width is 13.1mm, and maximum height is 9.3mm. The maximum weight of freshwater shells is 343mg.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis, {{common name}} the river nerite, is {{a species of}} small {{freshwater}} and <b>brackish</b> <b>water</b> snail with a gill and an operculum, an aquatic gastropod mollusk in the family Neritidae, the nerites.|$|E

5|$|This widely {{distributed}} neritid snail species occurs from Europe to Central Asia. It has a thick shell with a calcified operculum. The coloration {{pattern on the}} shell is very variable. Theodoxus fluviatilis lives in freshwater and in <b>brackish</b> <b>water,</b> in rivers and lakes on stones. It feeds mainly by grazing on biofilms and diatoms.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit <b>brackish</b> <b>water,</b> {{but there are no}} true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters. Such {{was the case with the}} Black Sea invasion of the natural hybrid Pelophylax esculentus reported in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Next is the Menefee Formation, {{the middle}} {{formation}} whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of <b>brackish</b> <b>water,</b> such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional {{environment and the}} organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.|$|E

40|$|The {{numbers of}} exotic species {{introduced}} into <b>brackish</b> <b>waters</b> (5 - 20 psu) and high-salinity waters (> 20 psu) in the Netherlands are hypothesized to reflect species richness in such waters {{elsewhere in the}} world. Notwithstanding the fact that species numbers in <b>brackish</b> <b>waters</b> {{all over the world}} are lower than in high-salinity waters, the numbers of introduced species in these waters in the Netherlands are about equal. Alternative hypotheses to explain this phenomenon are: (1) because most ports are situated in brackish regions, brackish-water species stand a better chance of being transported; (2) because brackish-water species are more tolerant of conditions in ballast water tanks, these species have a better chance of being transported alive than high-salinity species; and (3) because <b>brackish</b> <b>waters</b> have few species, it is easier for an introduced species to establish itself in <b>brackish</b> <b>waters.</b> None of the latter three hypotheses can be rejected and probably they all play a part in explaining the phenomenon. The third hypothesis, however, seems most likely...|$|R
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae deposited in a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to <b>brackish</b> <b>water.</b> Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been deposited in a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis littoralis (Linnaeus, 1789)– was {{described}} from <b>brackish</b> <b>water</b> by Linnaeus {{as a separate}} species, originally named Nerita littoralis. A study by Zettler (2008) proved that {{its status as a}} subspecies is unjustified, being regarded as a synonym of Theodoxus fluviatilis. Although these so-called forms (form fluviatilis and form littoralis) differ in morphology, ecology, reproductive strategy and behaviour, they are probably just ecomorphs.|$|E
5|$|Theodoxus fluviatilis serves an {{indicator}} species for river monitoring (in Germany); however the spreading populations {{also have a}} high tolerance for degraded habitats. Theodoxus fluviatilis has a large phenotypic plasticity: it was found living on stones and on dead wood in freshwater environments; whereas it lives on stones and on Fucus vesiculosus, Potamogeton spp. and Zostera marina in <b>brackish</b> <b>water</b> in the Baltic Sea. The species {{can also be found}} on aggregates of Mytilus.|$|E

5|$|As {{distance}} between {{the mouth of the}} St. Johns and the middle and upper basins increases, the salinity in the river gradually decreases. Marine water measures at 35parts per thousand (ppt) or more while fresh water measures below 2ppt. What ranges in between is characterized as <b>brackish</b> <b>water.</b> Near the center of Jacksonville, average measures have been collected at 11.40ppt. Farther south at the Buckman Bridge, joining the south side of Jacksonville to Orange Park, it decreases to 2.9ppt and falls again to 0.81ppt at the Shands Bridge near Green Cove Springs.|$|E
5|$|Bivalves {{appear in}} the fossil record first in the early Cambrian more than 500 million years ago. The total number of living species is about 9,200. These species are placed within 1,260 genera and 106 families. Marine {{bivalves}} (including <b>brackish</b> <b>water</b> and estuarine species) represent about 8,000 species, combined in four subclasses and 99 families with 1,100 genera. The largest recent marine families are the Veneridae, with more than 680 species and the Tellinidae and Lucinidae, each with over 500 species. The freshwater bivalves include seven families, the largest of which are the Unionidae, with about 700 species.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in <b>brackish</b> <b>water</b> marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E

5|$|It is {{uncertain}} how ctenophores control their buoyancy, but experiments {{have shown that}} some species rely on osmotic pressure to adapt to water of different densities. Their body fluids are normally as concentrated as seawater. If they enter less dense <b>brackish</b> <b>water,</b> the ciliary rosettes in the body cavity may pump this into the mesoglea to increase its bulk and decrease its density, to avoid sinking. Conversely if they move from brackish to full-strength seawater, the rosettes may pump {{water out of the}} mesoglea to reduce its volume and increase its density.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are a very}} widespread {{group of}} fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or <b>brackish</b> <b>water.</b> They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses, having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E
