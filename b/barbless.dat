5|$|Jack jumper ants are {{primarily}} active {{during the day}} and live in open habitats, nesting in bushland, woodland and dry open forests, surrounded by gravel and sandy soil, which can be found in rural areas and are less common in urban areas. They prey on small insects and use their <b>barbless</b> stinger to kill other insects by injecting venom. Other ants and predatory invertebrates prey on the jack jumper. The average worker has a life expectancy of over one year. Workers are gamergates, allowing them to reproduce with drones, whether or not a queen is present in the colony. The ant {{is a part of the}} Myrmecia pilosula species complex; this ant and other members of the complex are known to have a single pair of chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|In some jurisdictions, in the Canadian {{province}} of Manitoba, for example, catch and release is mandatory for some {{species such as}} brook trout. Many of the jurisdictions which mandate the live release of sport fish also {{require the use of}} artificial lures and <b>barbless</b> hooks to minimise the chance of injury to fish. Mandatory catch and release also exists in the Republic of Ireland where it was introduced as a conservation measure to prevent the decline of Atlantic salmon stocks on some rivers. In Switzerland, catch and release fishing is considered inhumane and was banned in September 2008.|$|E
25|$|The Clearwater River {{remained}} almost {{devoid of}} fish {{for the next}} 30 years. An assessment in 1992 showed that the river downstream from the Mahood confluence had far fewer fish than upstream, proving the serious effect of the Clearwater River Road. In 1994, new regulations came into effect which called for catch and release, a bait ban, a single <b>barbless</b> hook, and no fishing prior to July 15 each year. Another 10 years passed before the fishing improved, but in 2010 the regulations were still being enforced. These rules apply only to the Clearwater River downstream from Clearwater Lake.|$|E
25|$|Pole {{and line}} vessels – are used mainly to catch tuna and skipjack. The fishers {{stand at the}} railing or on special {{platforms}} and fish with poles and lines. The lines have hooks which are baited, preferably with live bait. Caught tuna are swung on board, by two to three fishermen if the tuna is big, or with an automated swinging mechanism. The tuna usually release themselves from the <b>barbless</b> hook {{when they hit the}} deck. Tanks with live bait are placed round the decks, and water spray systems are used to attract the fish. The vessels are 15 to 45 metres o/a. On smaller vessels fishers fish from the main deck right around the boat. With larger vessels, there are two different deck styles: the American style and the Japanese style.|$|E
25|$|Some {{recreational}} fishing groups are also promoting a catch and release {{practice for the}} giant trevally, with this becoming an increasingly popular option for charter boat operators, who have also begun to tag giant trevally for scientific purposes. At large sizes, the species {{is more likely to}} be ciguatoxic, so if the fish is kept, it must be disposed of or sent to a taxidermist if it is a trophy fish. A catch and release approach has also been adopted by operators outside of Hawaii, with Australian operators who target the species by popping and jigging rarely keeping any fish. Careful fish handling techniques have also been implemented by anglers so as not to damage the fish; such techniques include supporting the fish's weight, using <b>barbless</b> single, rather than treble, hooks and restricting the time the fish spends out the water to a minimum.|$|E
2500|$|Australian bass {{fishermen}} {{almost exclusively}} practice catch and release, which {{is necessary for}} the preservation of wild Australian bass stocks. [...] The use of <b>barbless</b> hooks (which can be created by crushing the barbs flat with a pair of needle-nosed pliers) is essential as Australian bass hit lures with great ferocity and are consequently almost impossible to unhook on barbed hooks. [...] Conversely, Australian bass are swiftly and easily released if <b>barbless</b> hooks are used.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Barbless</b> hooks, {{which can}} be created from a {{standard}} hook by removing the barb with pliers or can be bought, are sometimes resisted by anglers {{because they believe that}} increased escapement results. <b>Barbless</b> hooks reduce handling time, thereby increasing survival. [...] Concentrating on keeping the line taut while fighting fish, using recurved point or [...] "triple grip" [...] style hooks on lures, and equipping lures that do not have them with split rings can significantly reduce escapement.|$|E
2500|$|The hook {{point is}} {{probably}} {{the most important part of}} the hook. It is the point that must penetrate fish flesh and secure the fish. The profile of the hook point and its length influence how well the point penetrates. The barb influences how far the point penetrates, how much pressure is required to penetrate and ultimately the holding power of the hook. Hook points are mechanically (ground) or chemically sharpened. Some hooks are <b>barbless.</b> Historically, many ancient fish hooks were <b>barbless,</b> but today a <b>barbless</b> hook is used to make hook removal and fish release less stressful on the fish. Hook points are also described relative to their offset from the hook shank. A kirbed hook point is offset to the left, a straight point has no offset and a reversed point is offset to the right.|$|E
2500|$|Some [...] "catch and release" [...] anglers flatten the barb {{of their}} hook. Such [...] "barbless hooks" [...] are {{much easier to}} remove from the fish (and from the angler, {{in the event of}} mishap). Many rivers with special {{regulations}} mandate that fishermen use <b>barbless</b> hooks in an effort to conserve a healthy fish population.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{they have}} very sharp and {{numerous}} teeth, care is required in unhooking a pike. <b>Barbless</b> trebles are recommended when angling for this species, as they simplify unhooking. This is undertaken using long forceps, with 30-cm artery clamps the ideal tool. When holding the pike from below on the lower jaw, it will open its mouth. It should be {{kept out of the}} water for the minimum amount of time possible, and should be given extra time to recover if being weighed and photographed before release. If practicing live release, calling the fish [...] "caught" [...] when it is alongside a boat is recommended. Remove the hook by grabbing it with needle-nosed pliers while the fish is still submerged and giving it a flip in the direction that turns the hook out of the mouth. This avoids damage to the fish and the stress of being out of water.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{the hook}} in angling is descended, historically, from what would today be called a [...] "gorge." [...] The word [...] "gorge", in this context, comes from the French word meaning [...] "throat." [...] Gorges were used by ancient peoples to capture fish and animals like seal, walrus and birds. A gorge was a long, thin piece of bone or stone {{attached}} by its midpoint to a thin line. The gorge would be baited {{so that it would}} rest parallel to the lay of the line. When the game would swallow the bait, a tug on the line would cause the gorge to orient itself at right angles to the line, thereby sticking in the fish or animal's throat or gullet. [...] Some laws and regulations require hooks to be <b>barbless.</b> [...] This rule is commonly implemented to protect populations of certain species. [...] A barbed hook could kill a fish if it were to penetrate the gills.|$|E
2500|$|Anglers {{visiting the}} park to fish will {{encounter}} westslope cutthroat, Yellowstone cutthroat, rainbow, brown, brook and lake trout, mountain whitefish and Arctic grayling. [...] The park's fishing season runs from the Saturday in May associated with Memorial Day to the first Sunday in November each year. [...] The National Park Service regulates angling {{in the park and}} classifies different fish available to the angler as either native or non-native species. [...] Any native species—cutthroat trout, grayling and whitefish—caught must be immediately released unharmed. [...] Non-natives—rainbow, brown, brook and lake trout have different bag limits depending on the waters fished. [...] Some non-natives are also subject to catch and release regulations and all lake trout caught in Yellowstone Lake or river must be killed. [...] All hooks used in the park must be <b>barbless</b> or have their barbs pinched down. [...] Many specific waters or sections of waters are closed either permanently for either safety reasons, wildlife management or to protect thermal features. [...] The National Park Service may also enact emergency closures and restrictions because of low water, high temperatures or fires.|$|E

6000|$|The Japs are the {{greatest}} market fishermen in the world. And some five hundred boats put out of San Pedro every day, to scour the ocean for [...] "the chicken of the sea," [...] as albacore are advertised {{to the millions of}} people who are always hungry. It must be said that the Japs mostly fish square. They use a hook, and a <b>barbless</b> hook at that. Usually four Japs constitute the crew of one of these fast eighty-horse-power motor-boats. They roam the sea with sharp eyes ever alert for that thin white line on the horizon, the feeding albacore. Their method of fishing is unique and picturesque. When they sight albacore they run up on the school and slow down.|$|E
6000|$|Now a [...] "Chinese line" [...] is a cunning device {{invented by}} the people whose name it bears. By a simple system of floats, weights, and anchors, {{thousands}} of hooks, each on a separate leader, are suspended {{at a distance of}} from six inches to a foot above the bottom. The remarkable thing about such a line is the hook. It is <b>barbless,</b> and in place of the barb, the hook is filed long and tapering to a point as sharp as that of a needle. These hoods are only a few inches apart, and when several thousand of them are suspended just above the bottom, like a fringe, for a couple of hundred fathoms, they present a formidable obstacle to the fish that travel along the bottom.|$|E
60|$|In {{the stern}} of the boat stands a huge tank, usually painted red. I have become used to seeing dots of red all over the ocean. This tank is kept full of fresh sea-water by a pump {{connected}} with the engine, and it is used to keep live bait--no other than the little anchovies. One Jap, using a little net, dips up live bait and throws them overboard to the albacore. Another Jap beats on the water with long bamboo poles, making splashes. The other two Japs have short, stiff poles with a wire attached and the <b>barbless</b> hook at the end. They put on a live bait and toss it over. Instantly they jerk hard, and two big white albacore, from fifteen to thirty pounds, come wiggling up on to {{the stern of}} the boat. Down goes the pole and whack! goes a club. It is all done with swift mechanical precision. It used to amaze me and fill me with sadness. If the Japs could hold the school of albacore they would very soon load the boat. But usually a school of albacore cannot be held long.|$|E
5000|$|The use of <b>barbless</b> hooks is an {{important}} aspect of catch and release; <b>barbless</b> hooks reduce injury and handling time, increasing survival. Frequently, fish caught on <b>barbless</b> hooks can be released without being removed from the water, and the hook(s) effortlessly slipped out with a single flick of the pliers or leader. <b>Barbless</b> hooks can be purchased from several major manufacturers or can be created from a standard hook by crushing the barb(s) flat with needle-nosed pliers. Some anglers avoid <b>barbless</b> hooks because of the erroneous belief that too many fish will escape. Concentrating on keeping the line tight at all times while fighting fish, equipping lures that do not have them with split rings, and using recurved point or [...] "Triple Grip" [...] style hooks on lures, will keep catch rates with <b>barbless</b> hooks as high as those achieved with barbed hooks.|$|E

5000|$|The {{vessel was}} built in 1961 by Ditmar-Donaldson in Costa Mesa as a {{personal}} fishing boat for Gilbert C. Van Camp III, the CEO of the Van Camp Seafood Company and makers of [...] "Chicken of the Sea" [...] tuna. As a fishing boat, the Vantuna was configured for albacore fishing. The vessel held two large, 2500 gal live bait tanks and a 15-ton refrigerated fish hold. Metal racks attached to the stern provided platforms for fishermen close to the water's surface. They used long fishing poles with stainless steel leaders and <b>barbless</b> hooks. When large schools of albacore were located, live bait thrown into the water caused the fish {{to go into a}} feeding frenzy where they would bite anything, including the <b>barbless</b> hooks of the fishing poles. Fish that were hooked were quickly pulled onboard by the fisherman. The <b>barbless</b> hooks would easily fall out of the fish's mouth, and then the fish was moved into the refrigerated hold. Although this was his personal fishing boat, Mr. Van Camp took the fish he caught to the factory where they were used by his company.|$|E
50|$|To make a hook <b>barbless,</b> the barb {{is simply}} crushed flat {{with a pair}} of needle-nosed pliers, a trivial task. Medium grit {{sandpaper}} can be further used to ensure complete removal of the barb, but this is not necessary and is rarely done.|$|E

Care needs to be taken when handling hooks as they can 'hook' the user. If a hook goes in deep enough below the barb, pulling the hook out will tear the flesh. There are three methods to remove a hook. The first is by cutting the flesh to remove it. The second is to cut the eye of the hook off and then push the remainder of the hook through the flesh and the third is to place pressure on the shank towards the flesh which pulls the barb into the now oval hole then push the hook out the way it came in.|$|E
