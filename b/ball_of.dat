5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, but the final day started poorly when Compton edged the second <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the next}} over, Compton bowled a googly to deceive Bradman, who {{expected}} {{the ball to}} turn in. However, it went the other way, took the outside edge and ran away past slip for four. Bradman leg glanced the next ball for another boundary, before again failing to read a googly on the third <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> the over. This time the edge went to Crapp, who failed {{to hold on to}} the catch. The sixth <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> Compton's over beat Bradman and hit him on the pads. Compton had control of Bradman for the over, but went unrewarded. At the other end, Morris continued to plunder Hutton's inaccurate leg breaks, and Australia reached lunch at 121/1, with Morris on 63 and Bradman on 35. Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs, and in the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs. Both Morris and Bradman had been given lives. Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.|$|E

5|$|She then {{played in}} the three T20s held at Bellerive Oval in Hobart. The first of these matches was a curtain-raiser to the match between the Australia and West Indies men teams, {{and was the first}} match to be shown live on free-to-air {{television}} in Australia. New Zealand batted first and Australian fast bowler Ellyse Perry extracted an outside edge from captain Aimee Watkins from the first <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> the match. The ball flew straight to Healy's mid-riff and she dropped it. Watkins went on to score 44 from 36 balls as New Zealand made 7/117 and Healy's only dismissal was to catch Nicola Browne from Sthalekar's off spin. Healy came to the crease at 6/107 {{at the end of the}} 19th over and had scored three runs from as many balls and found herself on strike for the final <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> the match, bowled by Browne, with Australia needing three runs for the win. The delivery was wide outside off and Healy's expansive shot took the outside edge of the bat and flew towards the vacant first slip area. It would have gone for a match-winning four runs but for New Zealand wicket-keeper Rachel Priest diving across and catching the ball one-handed in her right glove, handing the tourists a two-run victory.|$|E

40|$|The notion <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> convexity, {{considered}} in finite dimensional real Banach spaces, {{is a natural}} and useful extension of usual convexity; one replaces intersections of half-spaces by suitable intersections <b>of</b> <b>balls.</b> A subset $S$ of a normed space is called ball convex if it coincides with its ball hull, which is obtained as intersection <b>of</b> all <b>balls</b> (<b>of</b> fixed radius) containing $S$. Ball convex sets {{are closely related to}} notions like ball polytopes, complete sets, bodies of constant width, and spindle convexity. We will study geometric properties <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> convex bodies in normed spaces, for example deriving separation theorems, characterizations of strictly convex norms, and an application to complete sets. Our main results refer to minimal representations <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> convex bodies in terms <b>of</b> their <b>ball</b> exposed faces, to representations <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> hulls <b>of</b> sets via unions <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> hulls <b>of</b> finite subsets, and to <b>ball</b> convexity <b>of</b> increasing unions <b>of</b> <b>ball</b> convex bodies...|$|R

5|$|The Bal des Ardents (<b>Ball</b> <b>of</b> the Burning Men) or Bal des Sauvages (<b>Ball</b> <b>of</b> the Wild Men) was a {{masquerade}} ball held on 28January 1393 in Paris {{at which}} Charles VI of France {{performed in a}} dance with {{five members of the}} French nobility. Four of the dancers were killed in a fire caused by a torch brought in by a spectator, Charles's brother Louis, Duke of Orléans. Charles and another of the dancers survived. The ball was {{one of a number of}} events intended to entertain the young king, who the previous summer had suffered an attack of insanity. The event undermined confidence in Charles's capacity to rule; Parisians considered it proof of courtly decadence and threatened to rebel against the more powerful members of the nobility. The public's outrage forced the King and his brother Orléans, whom a contemporary chronicler accused of attempted regicide and sorcery, to offer penance for the event.|$|E

England also ended with 2/6 after a run out {{in an attempt to}} secure the winning run on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the matchJess Cameron scored the solitary six.|$|E
5|$|Adidas Terrestra Silverstream was the {{official}} match ball {{used in the}} final.

The ball's design was created by British independent brand specialist company Design Bridge, and influenced by the waters, in the Netherlands and Belgium. The ball contains synthetic foam layers, making it more comfortable to grip and smoother to control.

50|$|A perfect code may be {{interpreted}} as {{one in which the}} <b>balls</b> <b>of</b> Hamming radius t centered on codewords exactly fill out the space (t is the covering radius = packing radius).

5|$|Around 1:00am (evidence on {{the precise}} time conflicts) on Monday, 8 January, a {{rumbling}} or cracking noise was {{heard from the}} vessel, followed shortly by a huge explosion within its hull. The force of the explosion was seen to blow men from the jetty into the sea. Local residents reported seeing Betelgeuse engulfed in a <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> fire a few moments later. A series of further explosions followed, breaking the vessel in half. Much of the oil cargo still on board ignited and this generated temperatures estimated to exceed 1,000°C. The concrete unloading jetty crumbled and firefighters, arriving on the scene from several neighbouring towns, were unable to get near the vessel. The firefighters concentrated their efforts on preventing the fire from spreading to the tanks of the storage farm and on containing the oil spillage. Local families living on the island fled for their lives.|$|E
5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives the rotation of the central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E
5|$|Burton's death left Metallica's {{future in}} doubt.

Roughly 40 people, including Hammett's childhood friend, Les Claypool of Primus, Troy Gregory of Prong, and Jason Newsted, formerly of Flotsam and Jetsam, auditioned for the band. Newsted learned Metallica's entire set list; after the audition Metallica invited him to Tommy's Joynt in San Francisco. Hetfield, Ulrich, and Hammett decided on Newsted as Burton's replacement; Newsted's first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California. The members initiated Newsted by tricking him into eating a <b>ball</b> <b>of</b> wasabi.|$|E
