5|$|No gamma-ray <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> {{within our}} own galaxy, the Milky Way, has been observed, and the {{question}} of whether one has ever occurred remains unresolved. In light of evolving understanding of gamma-ray bursts and their progenitors, the scientific literature records a growing number of local, past, and future GRB candidates. Long duration GRBs are related to superluminous supernovae, or hypernovae, and most luminous blue variables (LBVs), and rapidly spinning Wolf–Rayet stars are believed to end their life cycles in core-collapse supernovae with an associated long-duration GRB. Knowledge of GRBs, however, is from metal-poor galaxies of former epochs of the universe's evolution, and it is impossible to directly extrapolate to encompass more evolved galaxies and stellar environments with a higher metallicity, such as the Milky Way.|$|E
5|$|After {{a period}} of air-to-air {{exercises}} and practice the Wing undertook a Circus operation on 3 August 1941. In the evening the Wing crossed out over Manston at 18,000ft and then dropped to 13,000ft over the coast at Gravelines and set course for Saint Omer. Near Ambleteuse five Bf 109Fs were sighted one thousand feet above and in front travelling past the Spitfires. The German fighters shadowed the flight before three detached and dived to attack, curving in from behind. The Spitfires turned into them. Finucane missed with his first burst of fire and chased the leading Bf 109 into cloud while following the Bf 109's condensation trail. Hitting the enemy with another <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> 200 yards the Bf 109 burst into flames. He sighted another formation of 18 Bf 109s above and climbed to attack supported by six Spitfires. Finucane scored hits on the tail unit of one which went down vertically and into a cloud layer at 2,000ft at which point contact was lost. Finucane claimed one destroyed and one probably destroyed. The operation elevated his tally to 7. The day was best remembered in Fighter Command {{for the loss of}} Flight Lieutenant Eric Lock who was shot down by ground-fire in the morning patrol.|$|E
5|$|Following David and Shaw's exodus for the Engineer home world, {{they arrive}} at a temple {{surrounded}} by scores of Engineers. David carpet bombs them with the mutagen, resulting in the extinction of all non-floral life on the planet, as well as mutations in the flora that can infect and impregnate organisms with Neomorphs. The Engineer ship crashes afterwards and Shaw dies from unknown means, though David preserves and utilizes her body in his eugenics experiments. Ten years later, a team from the colony ship Covenant is attacked by two Neomorphs that <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> two of their bodies. David intervenes by frightening them away with a flare gun. He urges the survivors to follow him to the temple, where he has established his laboratory. Sporting overgrown hair, David introduces himself and offers them shelter, while learning about the 2,000 colonists and hundreds of embryos in stasis aboard Covenant. He takes {{a special interest in}} the successor model from his own synthetic line, Walter, and tells him that Shaw died when the Engineer ship crashed. David claims to have loved Shaw and compares it to Walter's attachment to the terraforming expert Daniels, which Walter dismisses as being impossible. David attempts to bond with Walter by teaching him to play the flute. They recognize that while Walter is more advanced, he has been inhibited from creating, due to disturbances caused by David models with that feature.|$|E

Davis, Richard Lawrence, an unemployed and deranged housepainter from England, either <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> a crowd or stepped out from hiding behind a column and aimed a pistol at Jackson which misfired. Lawrence then pulled out a second pistol which also misfired. It has since been postulated that the moisture from the humid weather of the day contributed to the double misfiring. Lawrence was then restrained, with legend saying that Jackson attacked Lawrence with his cane, prompting his aides to restrain him. Others present, including Davy Crockett, restrained and disarmed Lawrence.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Britain {{revealed}} the Bf 110's fatal weaknesses as a daylight fighter against single-engine aircraft. A relatively large aircraft, it lacked the agility of the Hurricane and Spitfire and was easily seen. The World War I-era Bristol Fighter had done {{well with a}} rear gunner firing a rifle-caliber machine gun, but by World War II, this was insufficient to deter the eight-gun fighters facing the Bf 110. Its size and weight meant that it had high wing loading, which limited its maneuverability. Furthermore, although it had a higher top speed than contemporary RAF Hurricanes, it had poor acceleration. However, it was unique {{at the time as}} a long-range bomber escort, and did not have the problems of restricted range that hampered the Bf 109E. Although outclassed, it was still formidable as a high escort for bombers using the tactic of diving upon an enemy, delivering a long-range <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> its powerful forward-facing armament, then breaking contact to run for it.|$|E

40|$|The {{repetitive}} X-ray <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> the accretion-powered pulsar GRO J 1744 − 28 show {{similarities to}} the type II X-ray <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> the Rapid Burster. Several authors (notably Lewin et al.) {{have suggested that the}} <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> GRO J 1744 − 28 are type II <b>bursts</b> (which arise <b>from</b> the sudden release of gravitational potential energy). In this paper, we present another similarity between these sources. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer observations of GRO J 1744 − 28 show that at least 10 out of 94 bursts are followed by quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) with frequencies of ∼ 0. 4 Hz. The period of the oscillations decreases over their ∼ 30 – 80 s lifetime, and they occur during a spectrally hard “shoulder ” (or “plateau”) which follows the burst. In one case the QPO show a modulation envelope which resembles simple beating between two narrow-band oscillations at ∼ 0. 325 and ∼ 0. 375 Hz. Using EXOSAT observations, Lubin et al. found QPO with frequencies of 0. 039 to 0. 056 Hz following 10 out of 95 type II <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> the Rapid Burster. As in GRO J 1744 − 28 the period of these oscillations decreased over their ∼ 100 s lifetime, and they occurred only during spectrally hard “humps ” in the persistent emission. Even though the QPO frequencies differ by a factor of ∼ 10, we believe that this is further evidence that a similar accretion disk instability is responsible for the type II <b>bursts</b> <b>from</b> these two sources.

25|$|On 14 June 1807, Marchand led his {{division}} at the Battle of Friedland. Ney's corps formed the right flank, hidden in the Sortlack Wood. At 5:30 PM, Emperor Napoleon ordered a 20-gun battery to fire a salvo, signalling Ney to attack Bennigsen's left flank. As the VI Corps <b>burst</b> <b>from</b> the forest, Marchand took position on the right while Bisson formed to his left. Sweeping Russian light troops before him, Marchand diverged slightly {{to the right to}} push his opponents into the river. This opened a gap between the two divisions, which Russian cavalry tried to exploit. With the help of Marie Victor de Fay, marquis de Latour-Maubourg's cavalry, the enemy horsemen were dispersed. As Ney's troops advanced, they were enfiladed from the opposite bank of the river by a storm of cannon fire. As the soldiers hesitated, Bennigsen hurled a mass of cavalry at Bisson's left flank, causing Ney's corps to recoil. However, Claude Perrin Victor's I Corps arrived to beat back the Russians. This gave Ney and his officers time to rally the VI Corps and repulse the Russian Imperial Guard. At 8:30 PM, the troops of Marchand and Bisson seized Friedland itself.|$|E
25|$|On 6 July, he {{was flying}} one of eight Spitfires that were {{scrambled}} to intercept three Italian Cant bombers and 30 Macchi 202s, Italy's top-line fighter. The eight Spitfires dived straight into the Italians. In seconds, with one burst Beurling had damaged a bomber. Then, suddenly {{he was on the}} tail of a Macchi whose pilot (probably Sergente Maggiore Francesco Pecchiari from 51° Stormo), spotting the Spitfire, plunged into a dive.

Although he wasn't aware that he had been fired on, when Beurling inspected his Spitfire back at Takali, he found it riddled with bullets. Undaunted, that evening, just before dusk, he was in the air again in a patrol of four Spitfires. Radar had shown two German JU 88s and 20 Messerschmitts Bf 109Fs, heading towards Malta. After the four Spitfires dived and split up the formation, Beurling followed a fighter trying to escape at low level over the sea.
