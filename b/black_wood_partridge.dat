5000|$|The buffy-crowned <b>wood</b> <b>partridge</b> (Dendrortyx leucophrys) is {{a species}} of bird in the Odontophoridae family. It is found in Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and Nicaragua. Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests. Small groups forage in underbrush, secondary growth, near forest clearings and coffee plantations. The species local name is [...] "chir-ras-qua" [...] after its noisy call. It has a chicken-like appearance due to its long tail and legs. Its pale iris and streaked neck differentiates it from other quail like birds.|$|R
40|$|This {{study focused}} on removal of color, COD, and lignin in {{wastewater}} of pulp and paper mill using white <b>wood</b> ash and <b>black</b> <b>wood</b> ash that generated from boilers unit in the pulp and paper mill. Batch experiments were setup for studying the equilibrium time, pH, quantity of wood ash and adsorption isotherm. The results from the equilibrium time experiment concluded that the equilibrium time of the white wood ash is much more rapid than the <b>black</b> <b>wood</b> ash indicated as 2 minutes and 25 minutes, respectively. The effect of pH on the removal of such studied parameters was different for the white and <b>black</b> <b>wood</b> ash. Variation in pH of wastewater at the levels of 2 to 10 had no influence in removal of color (89 - 93 %), COD (66 - 70 %) and lignin (78 - 82 %) when white wood ash was used, whereas the effect of pH on the removal was evident when using <b>black</b> <b>wood</b> ash. The highest removal of color (42. 2 %), lignin (31. 1 %) and COD (29. 7 %) was found when the initial pH was adjusted to 2 and such removal was gradually decreased when pH was raised. The optimum dose of white wood ash for the highest removal efficiency was 20 g ash /L of wastewater. This amount of wood ash can remove color 95 %, lignin 80 % and COD 69 %. The reason for high removal efficiency of white wood ash might occur from the precipitation of lignin by CaO which is the major component of the ash. For the <b>black</b> <b>wood</b> ash, the optimum dose was calculated from the isotherm equation of adsorption, both by Langmuir and Freundlich isotherm. These isotherms were applicable to color and lignin, while they were inapplicable to COD. The isotherm for adsorption of color and lignin indicate that the removal mechanism by <b>black</b> <b>wood</b> ash {{was likely to be}} physical adsorption. The results indicated that the white wood ash was better than the <b>black</b> <b>wood</b> ash in treating the pulp and paper wastewater...|$|R

Sequence and phylogenetic analysis identified four genetically distinct genotypes, avian genotypes I to IV, from various avian hosts. In addition, the host range for Cryptosporidium galli was extended.
