5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing the repeal by a considerable margin. In the Senate, the repeal of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his <b>better</b> <b>judgment</b> to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold.

40|$|In {{philosophy}} of action, we typically aim to explain action {{by appealing to}} conative attitudes whose contents are either logically consistent propositions or can be rendered as such. Call this “the logical criterion. ” This is especially difficult to do with clear-minded, intentional incontinence since we have to explain how two judgments can have non-contradicting contents yet still aim at contradictory outcomes. Davidson devises an innovative way of doing this but compromises his ability to explain how our <b>better</b> <b>judgments</b> can cause our continent behaviors. In this essay, I preserve Davidson’s approach to the logical criterion but deviate from his broader theory of action by developing a default-interventionist dual systems theory of action. To do this, I focus on the dynamical relationship between System 1 and System 2 : the logical construction of value judgments in System 2 from System 1 and the imaginative construction of non-propositional conative attitudes in System 1 from System 2. I draw on Street’s Humean constructivism and Peacocke’s theory of imagination for logical and imaginative construction, respectively. Within this framework, I provide a new definition of continence and incontinence that satisfies the logical criterion and explains how our <b>better</b> <b>judgments</b> can cause our continent behaviors...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} self-efficacy and task complexity on audit judgment performance. Self-efficacy refers {{to the belief that}} a person has the capacity to organise and execute the course of action required to produce the desired outcome. The study employs a field experiment involving auditors from small and medium audit firms to evaluate internal control audit tasks. Using hierarchical regression analysis, the results indicate that auditors with high self-efficacy perform <b>better</b> audit <b>judgments</b> than those with low self-efficacy. The results also show the negative effects of task complexity on audit judgment performance. High self-efficacy contributes to <b>better</b> audit <b>judgment</b> performance when the tasks are simple. For complex tasks, however, high self-efficacy does not contribute to <b>better</b> audit <b>judgment</b> performance. This paper enhances the theoretical development of the concepts of audit judgment and decision-making by recognising the role of self-efficacy within the framework of social cognitive theory...|$|R

Against his <b>better</b> <b>judgment,</b> Ælfric agreed because he knew it would be done regardless of whether he helped or not. This, the Old English Hexateuch, was revolutionary, for {{it was the first time}} that the Bible was translated from Latin into the vernacular, that is, into Old English. To his translation of Genesis, he wrote a preface. This preface was to ensure that the uneducated who might read this translation of the Old Testament would understand that they ought not believe that the practices of the ancient Israelites were still acceptable for Christians. In his preface, Ælfric employs the same writing techniques that King Alfred used in his preface to a translation of the Cura Pastoralis. Also notable is that in his translation of Genesis Ælfric did not just translate it word for word from the Latin, which was common due to the belief that the word order of sacred Scripture was itself sacred. Rather, he translated much of it by its meaning; he recognized that the meaning of what the Bible said was the most important thing to be conveyed, not the word order.|$|E

Galton con-nected this {{phenomenon}} to the phrase vox populi in a 1907 paper. Arguably, {{an example of the}} phenomenon may be found in recent stabilization of the frequency of antidepressant use, following decades of increases. There is no evidence that a change in physician behaviour has caused this stabilization. The stable frequency more likely reflects decisions made by thousands of individual people based on their personal experiences. This may provide a statement from the vox populi on an optimal frequency of antidepressant use in contemporary populations under current conditions, a topic that has eluded the consensus of experts...|$|R

[...] Gosling sought to imbue his character with [...] "quiet strength" [...] and was inspired by the performance of Sam Shepard in Days of Heaven. Shepard co-starred in The Notebook. Filming took place in Charleston, South Carolina, in late 2002 and early 2003. Although Gosling and McAdams became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on the set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was uncooperative. The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads and noted that, [...] "against your <b>better</b> <b>judgment,</b> you root for the pair to beat the odds against them." [...] Desson Thomson of The Washington Post praised Gosling's [...] "beguiling unaffectedness" [...] and noted that [...] "it's hard not to like these two or begrudge them a great love together".
