Introduction The Unified Modelling Language (UML 1. 1, [Rational 97]) has recently been accepted by the OMG as an industry standard. It features a unified notation of widely accepted models such as class diagrams, use case diagrams, statecharts, sequence diagrams (or event traces) and so on.

40|$|Abstract. In {{implementation}} of elliptic curve cryptography, {{three kinds of}} finite fields have been widely studied, i. e. prime field, binary <b>field</b> and optimal <b>extension</b> <b>field.</b> In pairing-based cryptography, however, pairingfriendly curves are usually chosen among ordinary curves over prime fields and supersingular curves over <b>extension</b> <b>fields</b> with small characteristics. In this paper, we study pairings on elliptic curves over <b>extension</b> <b>fields</b> {{from the point of}} view of accelerating the Miller’s algorithm to present further advantage of pairing-friendly curves over <b>extension</b> <b>fields,</b> not relying on the much faster field arithmetic. We propose new pairings on elliptic curves over <b>extension</b> <b>fields</b> can make better use of the multi-pairing technique for the efficient implementation. By using some implementation skills, our new pairings could be implemented much more efficiently than the optimal ate pairing and the optimal twisted ate pairing on elliptic curves over <b>extension</b> <b>fields.</b> At last, we use the similar method to give more efficient pairings on Estibals’s supersingular curves over composite <b>extension</b> <b>fields</b> in parallel implementation...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY This paper {{proposes a}} Weil descent attack against {{elliptic}} curve cryptosystems over quartic <b>extension</b> <b>fields.</b> The scenario {{of the attack}} is as follows: First, one reduces a DLP on a Weierstrass form over the quartic extention of a finite field k to a DLP on a special form, called Scholten form, over the same field. Second, one reduces the DLP on the Scholten form to a DLP on a genus two hyperelliptic curve over the quadratic extension of k. Then, one reduces the DLP on the hyperelliptic curve to one on a Cab model over k. Finally, one obtains the discrete-log of original DLP by applying the Gaudry method to the DLP on the Cab model. In order {{to carry out the}} scenario, this paper shows that many of elliptic curve discrete-log problems over quartic <b>extension</b> <b>fields</b> of odd characteristics are reduced to genus two hyperelliptic curve discrete-log problems over quadratic <b>extension</b> <b>fields,</b> and that almost all of the genus two hyperelliptic curve discrete-log problems over quadratic <b>extension</b> <b>fields</b> of odd characteristics come under Weil descent attack.
