Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way.

500|$|Neil McCormick of The Telegraph {{classified}} {{the track}} as [...] "equating clumsiness with bumping and grinding sex," [...] where [...] " [...] switches {{back and forth}} between the two approaches so frequently that it almost sound like a duet between sweet and tough alter egos." [...] The National Si Hawkins confessed that [...] "Clumsy" [...] is [...] "a return to quirky form," [...] while John Murphy of musicOMH emphasized that the song was an [...] "undoubted highlight". Jonathan Riggs, penning for Idolator, opined that [...] "although none of the more manic moments match the frenzied brilliance of 'Toxic' (<b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>could,</b> really?), Britney keeps control of the pulsating 'Clumsy'." [...] While noting that [...] "Britney holds her own on the sexually charged 'Clumsy'," [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine suggested that Christina Aguilera would match better with the recording. Entertainment Weekly Nolan Feeney observed that [...] "the generic bass drop" [...] of the track is a [...] "missed opportunity." [...] Alex Macpherson of The Guardian was largely positive towards [...] "Clumsy", mentioning that it [...] "brings out grinding, Justice-style metallic synths, verses that jitter and hop uncontrollably, beery chants and an absurd moment when Spears' voice gets pitch-shifted thither and yon. But if much of her post-Blackout work seems to have had an absence of character as its end goal, [...] Spears sounds like she’s having the time of her life sparring with and riding the kitchen-sink beat.|$|E

The screams pierced the heart of the heavens. We didn't know what to do…. They were going from door to door, slaughtering everyone who was inside. The screams and the moans were terrible. People were crying Help! Help! <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> we do?" ...|$|E

In a telex to Bronfman, {{he said that}} his past had been “deliberately misinterpreted.” Nevertheless, he admitted that he had known about German reprisals against partisans: [...] "Yes, I knew. I was horrified. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> I do? I had either to continue to serve or be executed." [...] He said that he had never fired a shot or even seen a partisan. His former immediate superior at the time stated that Waldheim had [...] "remained confined to a desk".|$|E

2500|$|As one of {{the first}} music {{producer}} auteurs, he (along with George Martin) popularized the idea of the recording studio as a compositional tool. Only 21-years-old when he received the freedom to produce his own records with total creative autonomy, Wilson ignited an explosion of like-minded California producers, supplanting New York as the center of popular records, and becoming the first rock producer to use the studio as a discrete instrument. The Beach Boys were thus {{one of the}} first rock groups to exert studio control. Brother Carl Wilson explained the significance of Brian's control over the group's productions: [...] "Record companies were used to having absolute control over their artists. It was especially nervy, because Brian was a 21-year-old kid with just two albums. It was unheard of. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>could</b> they say? Brian made good records." [...] Music producers after the mid 1960s would draw on Wilson's influence, setting a precedent that allowed bands and artists to enter a recording studio and act as producers, either autonomously, or in conjunction with other like minds. In the late 1960s, Wilson also started a trend of [...] "project" [...] recording, where an artist records by himself instead of going into an established studio.|$|E
