5|$|Bikini waxing is the {{epilation}} of {{pubic hair}} beyond the bikini line {{by use of}} waxing. The bikini line delineates {{the part of a}} woman's pubic area to be covered by the bottom part of a bikini, which means any pubic hair visible <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of a swimsuit. Visible pubic hair is widely culturally disapproved, considered to be embarrassing, and often removed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, the {{countries}} of the Iberian peninsula began to sponsor exploration <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of Europe. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Cape Verde during his lifetime. After his death, exploration continued; Bartolomeu Dias (d. 1500) went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 and Vasco da Gama (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498. The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of exploration by Christopher Columbus (d. 1506) in 1492 that discovered the Americas. The English crown under Henry VII sponsored the voyage of John Cabot (d. 1498) in 1497, which landed on Cape Breton Island.|$|E

5|$|Kelbajar lay {{outside the}} contested enclave {{of the former}} Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast, but within Nagorno-Karabakh {{geographic}} region of Azerbaijan, that Armenian and Azerbaijani forces had been fighting over for five years. The offensive {{was the first time}} Armenian forces from Nagorno-Karabakh had advanced <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the enclave. Kelbajar rayon, located between Armenia and the western border of former NKAO, was composed of several dozen villages and its provincial capital, also named Kelbajar. According to Russian sources mountain troops from the 128th Regiment (7th Russian Army) stationed in Armenia participated in the seizure of Kelbajar in a blitzkrieg operation. After initial heavy resistance, the Azerbaijani defenses quickly collapsed and the provincial capital fell on April 3, 1993. Kelbajar is currently {{under the control of the}} Nagorno-Karabakh Republic.|$|E
5|$|Like its predecessor, Super Smash Bros. Melee {{differs from}} {{traditional}} fighting games as {{the objective is}} to force their opponents <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the stage. Most attacks inflict damage and can, if enough damage is dealt, knock back the enemy. Each character's health is measured by a meter that represents the damage received as a percentage. The higher the percentage value, the farther the player gets knocked back, and the easier they are to knock off the stage, which will result in the character's death and the loss of a stock, or life. Unlike other games of the same genre, in which moves are entered by button-input combinations, most moves in Super Smash Bros. Melee can be accessed via one-button presses and a joystick direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{roles of}} each deity were fluid, and each god could expand its nature {{to take on}} new characteristics. As a result, gods' roles are {{difficult}} to categorize or define. But despite their flexibility, the gods had limited abilities and spheres of influence. Not even the creator god could reach <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the cosmos that he created, and even Isis, though {{she was said to}} be the cleverest of the gods, was not omniscient. Richard H. Wilkinson, however, argues that some texts from the late New Kingdom suggest that, as beliefs about the god Amun evolved, he was thought to approach omniscience and omnipresence and to transcend the limits of the world in a way that other deities did not.|$|E

5|$|Cristina Kirchner is {{considered}} to be a populist leader and, like other contemporary populists in Latin America, built a system of propaganda to legitimize her actions: the Relato K. This propaganda works around a number of usual themes: the glorification of the state to the detriment of the individual rights; use of conspiracy theories to explain mistakes as attacks from others; blaming neoliberalism for the poverty; and glorifying democracy in speeches while maintaining only the appearance of it (procedural democracy). The political world is divided in two halves, the people and those against the people, with the Kirchners described as the saviors of the people. Under this vision, the people are treated like a homogeneous group, with a unified collective will, that the leader interprets <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of parliaments and parties. Kirchnerite writer Ernesto Laclau considers this the perfect form of democracy. This division is used to justify the rejection of those described as being against the people, and to polarize the population. The problems caused by her policies, such as inflation, are always explained as the result of class conflict and imperialism. Economic activity is described as a zero-sum game, where any wealth is the result of the exploitation of someone else, which justifies economic interventionism. Kirchner's victory in the 2011 election was used to justify authoritarian policies, as those policies would be the general will; opposition and criticism was often described as antidemocratic or even as the plotting of a coup d'état. Laclau's vision of the people has been criticized by other writers because it left little room for opposition or criticism, and because the citizen is actually reduced to a mere spectator unable to contest government policies.|$|E

25|$|The Force Recon platoons operate farther inland {{than their}} Division Recon counterparts, {{penetrating}} deeper into enemy territory from their assigned littoral (coastal) region within a force commander's 'tactical area of responsibility' (TAOR).

25|$|The Royal Burmese Army was {{organized}} into three general tiers: the Palace Guards, the Capital Defense Corps, {{and the field}} levies. Only the first two were the standing military.

The third, the field levies or conscripts, were usually raised just prior to or during wartime, and provided manpower to resist attacks and project power <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of the empire. Most of the field levy served in the infantry but the men for the elephantry, cavalry, artillery and naval corps were drawn from specific hereditary villages that specialized in respective military skills.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the non-Euclidean geometries had a ripple effect which went far <b>beyond</b> <b>the</b> <b>boundaries</b> of mathematics and science. The philosopher Immanuel Kant's treatment of human knowledge had a special role for geometry. It was his prime example of synthetic a priori knowledge; not derived from the senses nor deduced through logic— our knowledge of space was a truth that we were born with. Unfortunately for Kant, his concept of this unalterably true geometry was Euclidean. Theology was also affected by the change from absolute truth to relative truth {{in the way that}} mathematics is related to the world around it, that was a result of this paradigm shift.|$|E
