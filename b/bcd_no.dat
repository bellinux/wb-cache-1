50|$|Very soon or {{immediately}} after iron production ceased, habitation {{of the site}} resumed. This later Iron Age II phase seems to form the last extensive occupation of Tell Hammeh. Based on examination of the extensive pottery finds from this post-smelting phase, it can be assumed that the iron production activities must have ended no later than 750 <b>BC.</b> <b>No</b> settlement structures contemporary to the iron smelting phase are presently known from Tell Hammeh.|$|R

2500|$|In ancient times, the {{constellation}} {{was considered an}} asterism within Centaurus, and was considered {{to have been an}} arbitrary animal, killed, or about to be killed, on behalf of, or for, Centaurus. An alternative visualization, attested by Eratosthenes, saw this constellation as a wineskin held by Centaurus. [...] It was not separated from Centaurus until Hipparchus of Bithynia named it Therion (meaning beast) in the 3rd century <b>BC.</b> <b>No</b> particular animal was associated with it until the Latin translation of Ptolemy's work identified it with the wolf.|$|R
2500|$|Seleucus {{apparently}} minted coins {{during his}} stay in India, as several coins {{in his name}} are in the Indian standard and have been excavated in India.

Some of them also mention Seleucus in association with his son Antiochus as king, which would also imply a date as late as 293 <b>BC.</b> <b>No</b> Seleucid coins were struck in India thereafter and confirm the reversal of territory west of the Indus to Chandragupta.|$|R
50|$|During {{the reign}} of the Babylonian king Abieshu (c.1711-1684 BC) Babylonia lost its territories on the middle Euphrates where the kingdom of Khana was formed.

The appearance of the triple-disc cuirass in tombs and other representative artifacts from Campania, Lucania and Apulia coincides with the conquest of these regions by Samnite peoples.|$|R

5000|$|The Hallstatt plateau is a {{term used}} in {{archaeology}} that refers to a consistently flat area on graphs that plot radiocarbon dating against calendar dates.

A graffito dating to about 201 BC on a wall of the mortuary Temple of Seti I at Abydos, in which he is called by the Greek name Hyrgonaphor, is an attestation to the extent of his influence.

40|$|Interpretation of Radiocarbon dates can {{be rather}} complex. For example, {{variations}} in the natural 14 C content cause the 14 C clock rate to vary throughout time, causing the need for calibration of the 14 C timescale.

Radiocarbon dates of around 2450 BP always calibrate to ca. 800 - 400 <b>BC,</b> <b>no</b> matter the measurement precision.
