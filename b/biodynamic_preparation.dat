The experiment was conducted near Bonn, on a Fluvisol using a {{randomised complete block design}} (n= 6). Our results showed that plots which received either prepared or non-prepared FYM (30 Mg ha− 1 year− 1) had significantly increased soil pH, P and K concentrations, microbial biomass, dehydrogenase activity, decomposition (cotton strips), earthworm cast production and altered earthworm community composition than plots without FYM application.

40|$|This thesis {{work has}} the {{objective}} to study {{alternative ways of}} managing the organic matter in diverse agro-ecosystems, focusing on both quantitative and qualitative aspects. The effect of several organic matter-based farming practices, that are characteristic of the organic and biodynamic method, on biomass production, productivity, and soil microbial activity has been investigated through a multidisciplinary approach that embraced on-farm trials as well as reductionist greenhouse and laboratory experiments. The open field trials have been conducted in organic commercial farms in the Marche region and in low inputs small subsistence farms in the African Kingdom of Swaziland. In both cases, the farmers were involved as "partners" in the research, which allowed to get a system perception on the efficacy and feasibility of the investigated techniques, and helped to highlight main constraints in organic matter management. Over the {{three years of the}} PhD study, five experiments were carried out: 	Laboratory experiment to test phytoxocity effect due to diverse organic matters; 	Greenhouse experiment to assess the effect of one <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparation</b> on the germination of a highly-diversified green manure mixture; 	On-farm research in two biodynamic and organic farm in the Marche region (Italy) to investigate the effect on arable crops productivity and olive growth of diverse combinations of organic matters (qualitative and quantitative); 	Laboratory experiment to investigate the effect of one <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparation</b> on soil microbial metabolism; 	On-farm research in Swaziland (Africa) to assess alternative organic matter managements in a small-scale subsistence farming system, through a community-based approach. It is concluded that when low inputs cropping systems have to be performed, the appropriate use and recycling within the farm of organic matter becomes crucial to optimize nutrients flows as well as maintain overall soil fertility at acceptable levels. Highly humified organic matter showed to be quite effective in stimulating soil microbial activity, even in low doses, whereas the practice of "massive" green manuring proved to promote plant production although its feasibility is highly bound to the site characteristics. The on-farm methodology turned to be useful in formulating applicable research objectives, close to the farmers needs, and to test the field feasibility and adaptability of the technical solutions under the farmers' perspective in two far socio-economic and cultural contexts. However, the inevitable experimental simplification did not allow to achieve highly significant statistical results. ...|$|E

40|$|Author {{also known}} as Gillian Leslie ColeMore {{research}} {{attention has been paid}} to development of indicators of soil quality in relation to environmental sustainability than to food quality. Challenges in measuring and showing relationships between soil quality, food quality and human health are discussed. Comparative and long-term studies have shown that organic and biodynamic farming methods and use of composts and manures favourably affect soil quality, enhancing organic matter content and soil organism activity. However, measured effects on food quality have been lacking or inconsistent. Antioxidants, nitrates, trace elements, protein quality and ratios between element concentrations can be measured in assessing food quality. Many of these factors vary considerably with growing conditions and soil management techniques. Effects of factors such as water, light, soil type, variety and nutrient supply on lettuce growth, lettuce nutrient requirements, and recent research into effects of light on plant signalling and nitrogen metabolism arc reviewed and discussed. Recent research into factors influencing food quality has focussed on integration of growth and differentiation forces into "Vital quality" food. The biodynamic field-spray preparations 500 and 501 are used to balance effects of growth or "shade" forces from humus and fertilisers with the differentiating or "light' forces on plants. Literature indicates that the preparation 501 (silica-spray) appears to increase plant nutrient assimilation and production of more complex organic acids. Similar effects have been found for silica compounds applied to soil or nutrient solution. The main objective of the experimental work conducted for this thesis was to investigate whether relationships exist between soil management techniques and application of biodynamic sprays and plant product quality. Transplanted lettuces (cv. Canasta) were grown in a factorial designed field trial on Te Puke Series sandy loam with six treatments: control, soluble fertilisers (DAPCAN) and compost, each with, or without, biodynamic field-sprays 500 (twice) and 501 (3 times). High variability between plants within treatments and small differences between treatment means for most parameters measured prevented many statistically significant differences or relationships being found. Compost amendments appeared to enhance water and nutrient uptake during a dry season. However compost application at a rate to provide equivalent nitrogen to the soluble fertilisers resulted in high leaf concentrations of nitrates and potassium and low DM% and concentrations of sugars, antioxidants, calcium and magnesium. Plants in treatments given compost had highest yields; highest N, P and K concentrations at 28 days from transplanting (DAT); and highest K at 48 DAT. Plants in treatments given soluble fertilisers had highest Ca, Mg, Fe, Zn. and Cu concentrations and greater Ca: P and K: Ca + Mg ratios at 48 DAT. Application of biodynamic field-sprays appeared to have different effects on the plants in plots, depending upon whether they received compost or not. Plants in treatments given field-sprays but no compost had generally small head weight, greater dry matter % and root: shoot ratios at 28 DAT, and highest crude protein and Ferric reducing ability of plasma (FRAP) antioxidant concentration at 48 DAT. Plants in the biodynamic treatment, given compost and field-sprays, had highest P uptake between 28 and 48 DAT and highest fresh-weight at 48 DAT. Measurements of nitrate and sugar contents of leaf cell sap and amino acid concentrations in leaves yielded few, or no, significant differences between treatment means. Microbial activity measured by soil respiration ex situ at 28 DAT was highest in composted plots and lowest in sprayed plots. Measurement of AM fungi colonisation of roots gave inconclusive results. In a sensory evaluation, no significant differences in taste, bitterness, sweetness and preference ranking were found between lettuces from the different treatments. A greenhouse pot trial was undertaken to study the effects of the biodynamic silica spray in more detail. Lettuce transplants (cv. Cos Little Gem) were grown in the same soil and biodynamic compost as were used in the first trial and preparation 500 applied. Half the plants were sprayed 3 times with preparation 501. Measurements before and after the last spray time yielded insignificant differences in light absorption at most wavelengths, net photosynthesis and nitrate, sugar and amino acid concentration in leaves. Silica sprayed plants had higher rates of transpiration and stomatal conductance and higher estimated light absorption of blue and near infrared wavelengths 21 / 2 hours after spraying. Mainly inconclusive effects of treatments were due partly to the large natural plant to plant (within replication) variation. It was concluded that organic and biodynamic management of lettuces may result in some favourable quality attributes compared to soluble fertilisers but not necessarily all. Results are likely to be specific to particular climatic and soil conditions. It is recommended that further trials be carried out to evaluate influences of biodynamic practices on vegetable food quality in controlled, well-replicated conditions, to improve likelihood of showing statistical differences between treatments. Such trials are needed in a variety of soil, climatic and management conditions, to better understand how different conditions and their interactions affect food quality parameters. Relationships between <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparation</b> application, soil biota populations and activity, plant metabolism and food product quality, particularly nitrogen assimilation into complex molecules such as essential amino acids, should be explored...|$|E

RT caused stratification of soil organic carbon (Corg), microbial properties and soil nutrients in the soil profile. Under RT, Corg in the 0 - 10 cm soil layer increased from 2. 19 to 2. 61 % (w/w) from 2002 to 2008, whereas it remained constant under CT. In both tillage treatments, Corg remained constant in the 10 - 20 cm soil depth. Microbial biomass C increased by 37 % under RT in the 0 - 10 cm soil depth and microbial activity [dehydrogenase activity (DHA) ] was enhanced by 57 %. Soil microbial biomass C and DHA in the 10 - 20 cm soil depth were also higher under RT (+ 10 and + 17 %, respectively). Soluble soil P and K were 72 and 40 %, respectively, higher in 0 - 10 cm soil depth under RT when compared with CT.

CPMAS-NMR spectra of <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparations</b> showed a carbon distribution with an overall low hydrophobic character and significant contribution of lignocellulosic derivatives. The results of thermochemolysis confirmed the characteristic highlighted by NMR spectroscopy, revealing a molecular composition based on alkyl components of plant and microbial origin and the stable incorporation of lignin derivatives. The presence of biolabile components and of undecomposed lignin compounds in the preparation 500 should be accounted to its particularly slow maturation process, as compared to common composting procedures. Our results provide, for the first time, a scientific characterization of an essential product in biodynamic agriculture, and show that biodynamic products appear to be enriched of biolabile components and, therefore, potentially conducive to plant growth stimulation...|$|R
40|$|Type {{and rate}} of {{fertilizers}} influence the level of soil organic carbon (Corg) and total nitrogen (Nt) markedly, but the effect on C and N partitioning into different pools is open to question. The objectives of the present work were to: (i) 	quantify the impact of fertilizer type and rate on labile, intermediate and passive C and N pools by {{using a combination of}} biological, chemical and mathematical methods; (ii) 	explain previously reported differences in the soil organic matter (SOM) levels between soils receiving farmyard manure with or without <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparations</b> by using Corg time series and information on SOM partitioning; and (iii) 	quantify the long-term and short-term dynamics of SOM in density fractions and microbial biomass as affected by fertilizer type and rate and determine the incorporation of crop residues into labile SOM fractions. Samples were taken from a sandy Cambisol from the long-term fertilization trial in Darmstadt, Germany, founded in 1980. The nine treatments (four field replicates) were: straw incorporation plus application of mineral fertilizer (MSI) and application of rotted farmyard manure with (DYN) or without (FYM) addition of <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparations,</b> each at high (140 – 150 kg N ha- 1 year- 1; MSIH, DYNH, FYMH), medium (100 kg N ha- 1 year- 1; MSIM, DYNM, FYMM) and low (50 – 60 kg N ha- 1 year- 1; MSIL, DYNL, FYML) rates. The main findings were: (i) 	The stocks of Corg (t ha- 1) were affected by fertilizer type and rate and increased in the order MSIL (23. 6), MSIM (23. 7), MSIH (24. 2) FYML > MSIH, MSIL for all sampling dates in 2008 (March, May, September, December). However, statistical significance of treatment effects differed between the dates, probably due to dif-ferences in the spatial variation throughout the year. The high proportion of LFOC on total Corg stocks (45 – 55 %) highlighted the importance of selective preservation of OM as a stabilization mechanism in this sandy Cambisol. The apparent turnover time of LFOC was between 21 and 32 years, which agreed very well with studies with substantially longer vegetation change compared to our study. Overall, both approaches; (I) the combination of incubation, chemical fractionation and simple modelling and (II) the density fractionation; provided complementary information on the partitioning of SOM into pools of different stability. The density fractionation showed that differences in Corg stocks between FYM and MSI treatments were mainly located in the light fraction, i. e. induced by higher recalcitrance of the organic input in the FYM treatments. Moreover, the use of the combination of biological, chemical and mathematical methods indicated that effects of fertilizer rate on total Corg and Nt stocks may be short-lived, but that the effect of fertilizer type may persist for longer time spans in the sandy Cambisol.

In the conventional cotton arena the {{genetically modified cotton}} is growing at an unprecedented rate. Considering the above factors it was considered necessary {{to carry out a}} `System’ comparisons in which the four systems can be compared. Further the research hopes to answer the larger questions o Put the discussion regarding the benefits and drawbacks of organic agriculture on a rational footing; o Help to identify challenges for organic agriculture that can then be addressed systematically; o Provide physical reference points for stakeholders in agricultural research and development and thus support decision-making and agricultural policy dialogue at different levels. At the farmers level the following outcomes are expected: What happens to yields of the crops when you stop using fertilizers and pesticides ? What happens to the pests when you don’t usefertilizers and pesticides? How do the crops grow when only farmyard manure or compost is used? Can we effectively control pests in the organic and biodynamic systems using a range of botnaical sprays ? Are the <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparations</b> effective?

40|$|In a {{recently}} started long-term field trial (2002 - 2011), located in Frick (1000 mm mean annual precipi-tation) near Basle (Switzerland), {{the effect of}} reduced tillage on crop yield, weed infestation, and oc-currence of toxigenic fusaria was studied on a heavy soil (45 % clay) in a crop rotation under organic farming conditions. Here, we present results {{of the first two}} experimental years (2003 - 2004), which are considered as the conversion period. Wheat yield was 16 % higher (p < 0. 001) in ploughed plots than in the plots with reduced tillage (chisel and rotary harrow). In the following year, sunflower yield was enhanced by 5 % (p = 0. 06) in reduced tilled plots. Reduced tilled plots manifested a higher weed infestation, in particular with Convolvulus arvensis and Stellaria media. With the exception of low levels of Fusarium poae, no toxigenic fusaria were detected in wheat grains possibly due to the excep-tionally dry and hot summer 2003. The deoxynivalenol (DON) content was low in all treatments. While the DON content in wheat straw was increased after reduced tillage, it was decreased after ap-plication of <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparations</b> (p < 0. 05). Overall, we assume that even on heavy soils, reduced tillage systems may be applicable on organic farms, but with a considerably higher input of labour...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Over {{the period}} of 2014 - 2015, on the {{experimental}} field of the Institute of Agriculture in Karnobat, Bulgaria, was set a field trial with twenty cultivars of barley – 15 two-row: Obzor, Emon, Perun, Orfey, Lardeya, Asparuh, Kuber, Zagorets, Imeon, Sayra, Devinya, Sitara, Krami, Vicky, Potok; 3 four-row: Veslets, Aheloy 2, Tamaris; and 2 six-row cultivars – IZ Bori and Bozhin. All the cultivars were grown in three types of farming: conventional, organic and biodynamic. In conventional farming were applied pesticides and nitrogen fertilization. In the organic production were not used pesticides, mineral and organic fertilizers; and in biodynamic farming was applied biodynamic compost prepared from manure and <b>biodynamic</b> <b>preparations</b> (also organic). In conventional farming, the seeds were disinfected before sowing with Kinto plus (Triticonazole 20 g/l + Prochloraz 60 g/l), {{at a rate of}} 150 ml/ 100 kg seeds. In organic and biodynamic farming were used nondisinfected seeds. In the phenophase of full maturity of barley was conducted monitoring survey for plants infected with loose smut in all 2 the trial variants, the number of infected plants per m were counted and the infection rates were calculated. Infected plants of Tamaris grown in the three types of farming underwent microscopic analysis and measurement of 100 teliospores from each variant. The aim of this experiment was to investigate varietal susceptibility of barley to Ustilago nuda, grown in three types of farming, and to establish if the growing method affects the size of the teliospores of the pathogen. With two-row barley were found plants of Lardeya, Kuber, Devinya, Krami and Vicky infected with Ustilago nuda. Krami manifested the lowest resistance in the three types of farming. With four-row barley, Tamaris was found to be highly susceptible and Veslets was poorly resistant. Both cultivars expressed weaker susceptibility in conventional and biodynamic farming and stronger in organic. With six-row cultivars was found no infection. The cultivars of Obzor, Emon, Perun, Orfey, Asparuh, Zagorets, Imeon, Sayra, Sitara, Potok, Aheloy 2, IZ Bori and Bozhin were resistant to Ustilago nuda and are suitable to be grown in the three types of farming. The size of teliospores in organic farming exceeded the ones in conventional farming with 5. 28...|$|R
