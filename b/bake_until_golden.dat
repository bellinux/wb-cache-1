Traditional recipes usually involve brushing the log with the egg white {{left over from the}} yolk used in the dough. Other recipes use different washes, or an icing added after baking. The unbaked log is gently transferred to a sheet pan, left to rise, then <b>baked</b> <b>until</b> <b>golden</b> brown.|$|R
