40|$|When Yugoslavia was {{expelled}} from the Cominform in 1948, the Western Powers (Britain, the USA, France) were taking action to counter a perceived Soviet threat. This included the policy of liberating Eastern Europe from Communist domination. Tito's expulsion was misinterpreted by the Western Powers: assuming that Tito had initiated it, the Western Powers hoped for similar "defections" by other Communis regimes. The sowing of discord between the Satellite leaders (including Mao) and Stalin became a new facet of the Liberation policy. Yugoslavia was treated as show-case to demonstrate to Satellite leaders that they could obtain aid from the West if they ceased to support Stalin. In {{the case of the}} European Satellite leaders, this policy was a miscalculation: they had no intention of breaking with Stalin and the alternative of obtaining help from the Western Powers had little credibility in view of their anti-Communist propaganda and subversive secret operations. The Americans for other reasons failed to encourage existing emancipatory trends among the Chinese Communist leaders. British recognition of Mao's regime was not enough to draw Mao away from Stalin. Yugoslavia's other role was strategic and it gained particular importance for the West in the context of increased defensive measures after the outbreak of the Korean War. The Western Powers gave Yugoslavia arms and economic aid to strengthen her as a shield for the defence of NATO territory. Yet Yugoslavia was discouraged from committing herself to the West by Western reluctance to give away NATO information. Italo- Yugoslav defence co-ordination would have been necessary but was made impossible by disagreements about Trieste, also involving the Western Powers. The Trieste crisis of late 1953 set back Western-Yugoslav relations significantly, perhaps irretrievably. The ephemeral <b>Balkan</b> <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> of 1954 between Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey was no substitute, and with the waning of the Soviet threat for Yugoslavia after Stalin's death in 1953 Tito became less interested in defence-cooperation with the Western Powers. </p...|$|E
50|$|In 1999 Namibia {{signed a}} mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> with its {{northern}} neighbour Angola.This affected the Angolan Civil War {{that had been}} ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Both being leftist movements, SWAPO wanted to support the ruling party MPLA in Angola to fight the rebel movement UNITA, whose stronghold was in southern Angola. The <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking UNITA.|$|R

50|$|Western Europe, therefore, {{sought a}} new mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> {{involving}} the United States, a powerful military force {{for such an}} alliance. The United States, concerned with containing {{the influence of the}} USSR, was responsive.|$|R
50|$|In March 1939, Britain and France {{guaranteed}} {{the independence of}} Poland. Hitler's claims {{in the summer of}} 1939 on Danzig and the Polish provoked yet another international crisis. On August 25, Britain signed the Polish-British Common <b>Defence</b> <b>Pact.</b>|$|R
50|$|Uzbekistan and Russia {{signed a}} mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> in 2005, that will also result in closer {{military}} cooperation.

50|$|Following the Samu Incident, Jordan and Egypt, in {{signing a}} mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> on 30 May 1967, agreed to {{revitalise}} the UAC, placing {{it under the}} command of Abdul Munim Riad, {{chief of staff of the}} Egyptian military. Nonetheless, when the 1967 Six-Day War began, the UAC was no longer considered an active body.|$|R
50|$|In {{that same}} year Ahmad bin Yahya forged {{connections}} and signed agreements during a tour to Soviet bloc countries. In April 1956 he signed a mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> with Egypt, involving a unified military command, and in 1958 incorporated Yemen with the United Arab Republic of Egypt and Syria into what then became the United Arab States.|$|R
50|$|The conference quashed a {{proposal}} of a two-tier structure {{that would have}} had the traditional Commonwealth realms, perhaps with <b>defence</b> <b>pacts,</b> on one tier, and the new members which opted for a republic, on the second tier. The final compromise is perhaps best seen from the title finally accepted for the King, as Head of the Commonwealth.|$|R

25|$|When the {{division}} of Europe into two opposing camps became unavoidable, {{the threat of the}} Soviet Union became much more important than concerns over German rearmament. Western Europe therefore sought a new mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> involving the United States. The United States recognized the growing threat of the USSR and was responsive to this concept. Secret meetings began by the end of March 1949 between American, Canadian and British officials to negotiate such a trans-Atlantic mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact.</b> Eventually, it would lead to the formation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) with the North Atlantic Treaty signed in Washington, D.C. in 1949. NATO began forming its own military command structure in 1951, at which time the headquarters, personnel and plans of the WUDO were transferred to Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE), and SHAPE took over responsibility for the defence of Western Europe.|$|R
50|$|As a result, {{relations}} between India and Sri Lanka became extremely sour and India {{vowed never to}} offer any military help to Sri Lanka again. This policy has not been changed since and no <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> has been signed between India and Sri Lanka. India has never been {{directly involved in the}} peace talks between the LTTE and Sri Lanka but has supported Norway's efforts.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{creation}} of the Pan American Union mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> in July 1940 and entry into the war on the Allied side after the attack on Pearl Harbor, Costa Rica, El Salvador and the Dominican Republic offered diplomatic recognition of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo which was not recognized as a legitimate state by a majority of the world’s nations at the time, including the United States.|$|R
50|$|The Western European Union {{was formed}} by the Treaty of Brussels on 17 March 1948. Belgium, France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom were the {{original}} signers of the treaty. It was further amended by the Protocol signed at Paris on 23 October 1954, which modified and completed the treaty, adding Germany and Italy to the treaty. Part of this frame work was a mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> amongst the signatories.|$|R
50|$|Namibia borders Angola to the south. In 1999 Namibia {{signed a}} mutual defense pact with its {{northern}} neighbor Angola.This affected the Angolan Civil War {{that had been}} ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Namibia's ruling party SWAPO sought to support the ruling party MPLA in Angola against the rebel movement UNITA, whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering to Namibia. The <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking Jonas Savimbi's UNITA.|$|R
25|$|The plan {{assumed that}} Polish forces {{would be able}} to hold for several months but due to German {{numerical}} and technical superiority would be pushed back (it was estimated Germans would have two to threefold advantage), until pressure from Western Allies (France and United Kingdom) who were obliged (through the Franco-Polish Military Alliance and Polish-British Common <b>Defence</b> <b>Pact)</b> to launch an offensive from the West would draw enough German forces away from the Polish front to allow Polish forces to launch a counteroffensive.|$|R
50|$|The Byzantine-Venetian Treaty of 1082 was a {{trade and}} <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> signed between the Byzantine Empire and the Republic of Venice, {{in the form}} of an {{imperial}} chrysobull, or golden bull, issued by Emperor Alexios I Komnenos. This treaty, which provided the Venetians with major trading concessions in exchange for their help in the wars against the Normans, would have a major impact on both the Empire and the Republic that would later dictate their histories for several centuries to come.|$|R

50|$|The {{latter half}} of the {{resolution}} addressed African nations. The Council encouraged African states to African Union Non-Aggression and Common <b>Defence</b> <b>Pact</b> of 31 January 2005 and to work with the United Nations Secretariat and regional offices to implement measures for establishing peace, security, stability, democracy and sustainable development. Meanwhile, the international community was called upon to support African nations in the aforementioned objectives, and to develop the capacities of African regional and subregional organisations to deploy civilian and military assets when needed.|$|R
5000|$|The ANZUS Treaty {{between the}} United States, Australia, and New Zealand {{was signed in}} 1951, locking the three {{countries}} into a mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact.</b> This increased social and political ties between Australia and the United States and led to Australia and New Zealand committing troops to the Vietnam War in the 1960s and 1970s — these connections and increased worldwide travel encouraged greater numbers of United States citizens to migrate permanently and in 1971 there were 39,035 United States-born residents in Australia ...|$|R
5|$|As Belgium had {{suffered}} so much damage in World War I, {{there was little}} appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict. In October 1936, King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral {{in the event of}} another war in Europe as part of what he termed an Independent Policy (Politique d'Indépendance). To this end, the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances: leaving the Locarno Treaty, repudiating a <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937.|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} August 1939, the German pre-dreadnought {{battleship}} [...] {{sailed to}} Danzig under the pretext of a courtesy visit and anchored in the channel [...] from Westerplatte. On board was the Marinestosstruppkompanie with orders to launch an attack against the Westerplatte {{on the morning of}} August 26. However, shortly before disembarkation, the order to attack was rescinded. As a result of Britain and Poland having signed the Polish-British Common <b>Defence</b> <b>Pact</b> on August 25, and also being informed that Italy was hesitant in fulfilling its obligations regarding the Pact of Steel, Adolf Hitler postponed the opening of hostilities.|$|R
50|$|Fraser was a {{key player}} in the {{negotiations}} with the South African Republic and President Kruger in the late 1880s. He provides much detail in his book Episodes in My Life (Cape Town: Juta, 1922) about negotiations regarding the proposed Customs Union, the building of railways and <b>defence</b> <b>pacts.</b> Fraser distrusted Kruger. Fraser stood for election to the position of President of the Orange Free State in 1896 and was defeated by Marthinus Theunis Steyn (the husband of his niece Rachel Isabella Fraser). He resigned his position as President of the Volksraad in 1896. He remained in Bloemfontein during the Anglo-Boer War.|$|R
50|$|As {{an effort}} towards European postwar {{security}} co-operation, the treaty was {{a precursor to}} NATO in that it promised European mutual defence. However, it greatly differed from NATO in that it envisaged a purely-European mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> primarily against Germany. When NATO took shape the next year, on the other hand, it was recognised that Europe was being unavoidably divided into two opposing blocks (western and communist), and the USSR was a much greater threat than {{the possibility of a}} resurgent Germany, and Western European mutual defence would have to be Atlanticist and so include North America.|$|R

50|$|By {{the late}} 1930s when world war {{was once again}} {{becoming}} inevitable, {{the government of the}} Second Polish Republic requested the necessary military aid from the British government; as Poland was still rebuilding civilian infrastructure from the aftermath of World War I. The government also signed a three-way mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> with the United Kingdom and France with the original intent being to make sure an independent and sovereign, democratic Poland would never again have to stand alone against a German invasion. Thus, much of the bureaucracy surrounding these pre-war pacts found itself centred in the halls and corridors of number 47, Portland Place.|$|R
50|$|Hertzog's {{problem was}} that South Africa was constitutionally obligated to support Great Britain against Nazi Germany. The Polish-British Common <b>Defence</b> <b>Pact</b> obligated Britain, and in turn its dominions, to help Poland if {{attacked}} by the Nazis. When Adolf Hitler's forces attacked Poland on 1 September 1939, Britain declared war on Germany two days later. A short but furious debate unfolded in South Africa, especially {{in the halls of}} power in the Parliament of South Africa. It pitted those who sought to enter the war on Britain's side, led by Smuts, against those who wanted to keep South Africa neutral, if not pro-Axis, led by Hertzog.|$|R

To defeat his rival Goukouni, probably persuaded by Acyl, signed on June 15 a <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> with Libya; as a result 7,000 Libyan troops and 7,000 members of the Libyan-raised Islamic Legion were in Chad by the end of 1980, and helped expelling Habré from N'Djamena on December 16, after a week of harsh fighting.|$|R
5000|$|After {{increasingly}} acrimonious debates, in August 1986 the United States formally suspended {{its security}} obligations to New Zealand {{that it had}} under the ANZUS mutual <b>defence</b> <b>pact.</b> This suspension remains in effect today, although the US no longer carries nuclear weapons aboard its surface naval vessels. In 1987 New Zealand passed legislation making the country a nuclear free zone, namely the New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone, Disarmament, and Arms Control Act; {{in the same year}} the US retaliated with the Broomfield Act, designating New Zealand as a [...] "friend" [...] rather than an [...] "ally". Relations between New Zealand and the US have had several ups and downs since then.|$|R

[...] Tensions {{between the two countries}} remained intense over the issue of foreign hostages in Iraq. During 2004-05, 14 Pakistani citizens were made hostages out of which two were killed.

50|$|He {{played a}} role in the 1949 coup that removed Husni al-Zaim from power and took over the {{personnel}} department of Adib Shishakli's government in 1952. When Shishakli was ousted, Sarraj was temporarily sent to Paris as an assistant military attache. However, in March 1955, he was appointed head of the Syrian military intelligence. From this position, he was able to play a crucial role in preventing conspiracies against the government. Sarraj did not join any political parties, but cooperated with the ones in power, in particular against the Ba'ath. In September 1957, he helped negotiate the landing of 4,000 Egyptian troops in Latakia as part of <b>defence</b> <b>pact</b> made between the two countries.|$|R
