5|$|Beer {{was such}} an {{important}} consumable to Americans that they would closely watch the stocks of barley held by farmers to ensure quality beer production. In John Adams' correspondence with his wife Abigail, he asked {{about the quality of}} barley crops to ensure adequate supply for the production of <b>beer</b> <b>for</b> himself and their friends. However, hops, essential to production of beer, did not grow well in the colonies. It only grew wild in the New World, and needed to be imported from England and elsewhere. In addition to these alcohol-based products produced in America, merchants imported wine and brandy. Beer was not only consumed for its flavor and alcohol content, but because it was safer to drink than water, which often harbored disease-causing microorganisms. Even children drank small beer.|$|E

5|$|The Free City of Danzig made Hitler {{an honorary}} {{citizen of the}} city as a {{birthday}} gift. Hitler received the citizenship papers from the hands of Albert Forster, the city's Nazi leader. Political and military tension between Germany and Poland was heightened at the time, and Time Magazine reported the possibility of Danzig being returned to Germany. Martin Bormann, Hitler's private secretary, had the Eagle's Nest constructed as the Nazi Party's birthday gift. Hitler, however, did not like the location, as he had a fear of heights. Because of his indigestion, Hitler did not drink alcohol, so a Munich brewery created a special batch of low alcohol <b>beer</b> <b>for</b> his birthday. The brew became a regular order.|$|E

25|$|In some sectors brewers are {{reluctant}} to embrace new technology for fear of losing the traditional characteristics of their <b>beer.</b> <b>For</b> example, Marston's Brewery in Burton on Trent still uses open wooden Burton Union sets for fermentation {{in order to maintain}} the quality and flavour of its beers, while Belgium's lambic brewers go so far as to expose their brews to outside air in order to pick up the natural wild yeasts which ferment the wort. Traditional brewing techniques protect the beer from oxidation by maintaining a carbon dioxide blanket over the wort as it ferments into beer.|$|E
25|$|Milwaukee became {{synonymous with}} Germans and beer {{beginning}} in the 1850s. The Germans had long enjoyed beer and set up breweries when they arrived in Milwaukee. By 1856, {{there were more than}} two dozen breweries in Milwaukee, most of them owned and operated by Germans. Besides making <b>beer</b> <b>for</b> the rest of the nation, Milwaukeeans enjoyed consuming the various beers produced in the city's breweries. As early as 1843, pioneer historian James Buck recorded 138 taverns in Milwaukee, an average of one per forty residents. Today, beer halls and taverns are abundant in the city, but only one of the major breweries—Miller—remains in Milwaukee.|$|E
25|$|The Japanese brought beer to Colonial Korea in the 1930s in {{the form}} of German lager beers.

Until the mid-1990s when the state rationing system started to crumble, North Koreans would receive one bottle of Korean liquor soju and three bottles of <b>beer</b> <b>for</b> every major public holiday in North Korea. All North Korean beers are bottled in domestic made glass bottles that are of poor quality. During the North Korean famine, beer bottles were used for intravenous therapy (IV) due to the shortage of proper hospital equipment.|$|E
