40|$|Thyroid hormone regulates {{a number}} of {{physiological}} functions during smolting in salmonids. However, the target sites and roles of thyroid hormone in {{the central nervous system}} (CNS) are not known in detail. We detected thyroid hormone-specific binding sites (i. e. thyroid hormone receptors) in the olfactory epithelium and the brain (the olfactory bulb, the telencephalon, the mid-brain and the cerebellum) of wild masu salmon, Oncorhynchus masou (Brevoort), during smolting by means of in vitro autoradiography with frozen sections. A saturation experiment with the brain indicated the presence of a single class of binding sites of high affinity. T 3 -specific binding was detected in the olfactory epithelium and in all regions of the brain except the olfactory bulb. The T 3 -specific <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> in the olfactory epithelium was higher than in all other regions of the brain. This <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> in the olfactory epithelium increased at the full-smolt stage. The presence of thyroid hormone receptors in various regions of the CNS suggests that thyroid hormone {{plays an important role in}} the functional change in the brain and the olfactory epithelium during smolting...|$|E
40|$|An immunoradiometric assay for IgG class {{autoantibody}} to liver membrane antigens, {{based on}} serum binding to glutaraldehyde treated monkey hepatocytes, {{was used to}} examine sera from patients with chronic active hepatitis (CAH) and other acute and chronic liver diseases. All sera from normals and patients showed binding, up to a titre of 1 / 2, 048. For comparison of assays, results were normalized by selecting two reference sera, one {{with a high degree of}} binding, and one from a healthy subject with a low degree of binding: at a dilution of 1 / 2, 048, these sera were given binding values of 100 % and 0 %. The values for the binding of unknown sera at the same dilution were calculated from these two reference values. For 26 patients with autoimmune CAH, the mean (+/- s. d.) percentage <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> (70 +/- 33 %) was significantly higher than the mean value for 26 healthy subjects (10 +/- 15 %), and high binding values were significantly associated with biochemically active hepatitis.

At a cut-off <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> of 65 %, the assay as a single diagnostic procedure was shown to have a 70 % sensitivity and a 95 % specificity for the diagnosis of autoimmune CAH.

40|$|Adenosine is a {{nucleoside}} displaying various biological effects via {{stimulation of}} four G-protein–coupled receptors, A 1, A 2 A, A 2 B, and A 3. Adenosine also modulates voltage-gated (Kv) and small conductance calcium-activated (SKCa) potassium channels. The {{effect of these}} potassium channels on the expression of adenosine receptors is poorly understood. We evaluated the action of BgK (a natural Kv channel blocker) and Lei-Dab 7 (a synthetic SKCa channel blocker) on the expression of adenosine A 2 A receptors (A 2 AR) in Jurkat human T cells. We found that Lei-Dab 7, but not BgK, increased the maximal <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> of the tritiated ligand ZM 241385 to A 2 AR in a dose-dependent manner (+ 45 % at 5 nM; + 70 % at 50 nM as compared to control).

The ligand affinity-related dissociation constant and A 2 AR mRNA amount were not significantly modified by either drug.

[3 H]Spiroperidol was bound by sections of rat mesentery {{in a manner consistent with}} the labeling of DA- 2 receptors, with a Kd value of 2. 48 nM and with a maximum <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> of 159 fmol/mg of protein. Light microscopic autoradiography revealed specific [3 H]spiroperidol binding sites primarily in the adventitial layer and in the adventitial-medial border as well as in the intimal layer. Adventitial and adventitial-medial binding sites disappeared after 6 -hydroxydopamine sympathectomy. In contrast, chemical sympathectomy was without effect on intimal [3 H]spiroperidol binding sites. The density of adventitial and adventitial-medial binding sites was higher in medium and small sized vessels than in larger ones. These findings are indicative of the existence of DA- 2 receptors sites located both prejunctionally (6 -hydroxydopamine-sensitive) and in the intimal layer. Prejunctional mesenteric DA- 2 receptors may be involved in the inhibition of noradrenaline release from sympathetic neuroeffector junctions.

The 18 kDa antigen was purified from M. paratu-berculosis as previously described. Serum was obtained from 40 patients with Crohn's disease, 15 with ulcerative colitis, 25 coeliac patients, and 21 normal blood donors.

We performed in vivo PET imaging with [18 F]DPA- 714 to determine {{the time course of}} PBR/TSPO expression over several days after induction of cerebral ischemia in rats. In vivo PET imaging showed significant increase in DPA (N,N-diethyl- 2 -(2 -(4 -(2 -fluoroethoxy) phenyl) - 5, 7 -dimethylpyrazolo[1, 5 -a]pyrimidin- 3 -yl) acetamide) uptake on the injured side compared with that in the contralateral area on days 7, 11, 15, and 21 after ischemia; the maximal <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> was reached 11 days after ischemia.

Furthermore, they only give protection to certain serogroups, not to all types of meningitis-inducing bacteria. Recently, research on epitope-based vaccines has been developed intensively. Such vaccines have potential advantages over conventional vaccines in that they are safer to use and well responded to the antibody. In this study, we developed epitope-based vaccine candidates against various meningitis-inducing bacteria, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitidis, and Haemophilus influenzae type b. The epitopes were selected from their protein of polysaccharide capsule. B-cell epitopes were predicted by using BCPred, while T-cell epitope for major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I was predicted using PAProC, TAPPred, and Immune Epitope Database. Immune Epitope Database was also used to predict T-cell epitope for MHC class II. Population coverage and molecular docking simulation were predicted against previously generated epitope vaccine candidates. The best candidates for MHC class I- and class II-restricted T-cell epitopes were MQYGDKTTF, MKEQNTLEI, ECTEGEPDY, DLSIVVPIY, YPMAMMWRNASNRAI, TLQMTLLGIVPNLNK, ETSLHHIPGISNYFI, and SLLYILEKNAEMEFD, which showed 80 % population coverage.

40|$|Differences in amylase action {{pattern on}} {{amylopectin}} were {{demonstrated by the}} relation between the decrease in potassium iodide-iodine binding of waxy maize starch and the increase in reducing value during hydrolysis, as expressed by the RV 80 value (i. e., the reducing value for a potassium iodide-iodine <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> of 80 % of that of the starting material). In the initial stages of the hydrolysis, the ratio of the increase in the level of reducing polysaccharicles to the increase in the total level of reducing sugars formed during amylolysis of amylopectin can be considered as a measure of the level of inner chain attack (LICA) in the overall hydrolysis of the amylopectin structure and correlated with the respective RV 80 value. Bacillus amyloliquefaciens alpha-amylase and Aspergillus oryzae alpha-amylase, with the lowest RV 80 and the highest LICA values, hydrolysed the inner chains of amylopectin {{to a greater extent than}} did porcine pancreatic alpha-amylase. In the initial stages of hydrolysis, Bacillus stearothermophilus maltogenic amylase, like the Bacillus cereus beta-amylase, did not display any significant degree of internal hydrolysis of amylopectin, in line with the high RV 80 and very low LICA values for these enzymes. However, at the later stages of hydrolysis, the maltogenic amylase probably exhibited a significant degree of internal hydrolysis of amylopectin, which itself seems to depend on temperature. The temperature dependence of the hydrolysis pattern of this enzyme is relevant for interpretation of its action as antifirming enzyme in bread-making applications. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

Accepting policy as a CEDM avenue the requirements of environmental understanding, information and perception are developed through aspects of the environment and sustainable development with rational ecology ultimately providing the guideposts and criteria whereby CEDM may be judged. Citizens are those environmental professionals where an ethic is shaped through systems learning with the Environmental Management System used as a framework to establish the CEDM network of relationships in the workplace. The professional's socially <b>binding</b> <b>value</b> is hypothesized as an obligation not to do harm. With this value orientation, rational ethics and systems thinking provide guidelines that direct the professional in evaluating and optimizing policy and business structures. The CEDM paradigm is illustrated as a social choice mechanism suited to the 1990 s and beyond by using case studies to apply policy directions...|$|E
40|$|The {{applicability}} {{of a new}} method of approximating the two-body t-matrix in separable form for general local short-range interaction, as suggested earlier, has been tested in the calculation of triton binding energy with Faddeev formalism. The square well potential is considered since convergent theoretical <b>binding</b> energy <b>values</b> by Sturmian expansion method is available for this potential. Using a two term and three term expansion, the <b>binding</b> energy <b>values</b> of triton have been evaluated taking the triplet plus singlet states of deuteron. It is observed that the <b>binding</b> energy <b>values</b> for the second case {{is very close to}} the result obtained by Kharchenko and Storozhenko for the same potential using the Sturmian expansion method. The present method her: the advantage over the Sturmian method that it is applicable to more general type short-range potentials and to higher partial waves...|$|R

For all viruses examined, {{we found that the}} half-maximal <b>binding</b> <b>values</b> of the anti-V 2 and anti-CD 4 -binding site antibodies with virion-associated gp 120 were higher than those with monomeric gp 120, but the maximum amount of antibodies bound was diminished only for one of the anti-V 2 antibodies tested. These observations suggest that upon gp 120 oligomerization, the V 2 loop and CD 4 -binding site undergo conformational changes and that particular epitopes within these domains are occluded in the oligomeric gp 120. In contrast, although the overall binding patterns and half-maximal <b>binding</b> <b>values</b> of the anti-V 3 loop antibodies tested were similar with monomeric and oligomeric gp 120, all the V 3 loop epitopes examined were less accessible to antibody binding on the virion surface. This masking of the V 3 loop is more pronounced for the primary-like macrophage-tropic isolates examined. Lastly, we observe that upon soluble receptor-virion binding, specific V 3 loop epitopes that differ for viruses displaying different tropisms are exposed...|$|R
40|$|UV-vis-spectra {{evolution}} of Nile Red loaded into Tween 20 micelles with pH and [Tween 20] have been analysed in a non-conventional manner by exploiting the deconvolution method. The number of buried sub-bands {{has been found}} to depend on both pH and bio-surfactant concentration, whose positions have been associated to Nile Red confined in aqueous solution and in the three micellar solubilisation sites. For the first time, by using an extended classical two-pseudo-phases-model, the robust treatment of the spectrophotometric data allows the estimation of Nile Red binding constant to the available loci. Hosting capability towards Nile Red is exalted by the pH enhancement. Comparison between <b>binding</b> constant <b>values</b> classically evaluated and those estimated by the deconvolution protocol unveiled that overall <b>binding</b> <b>values</b> perfectly match with the mean values of the local binding sites. This result suggests that deconvolution procedure provides more precise and reliable values, which are more representative of drug confinement...|$|R
