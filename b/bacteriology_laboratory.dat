25|$|During {{these years}} he {{travelled}} widely as a World Health Organization consultant to most {{countries in which}} childhood diarrhoea is a major problem. He established The WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Rotaviruses, (known as The WHO Lab), at his laboratory which was supported by The World Health Organisation from 1980 {{until his retirement in}} 1987. This laboratory was formerly a small tuberculosis <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratory.</b>|$|E
25|$|Upon the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in 1915, Cust left Ireland to volunteer at the front and appears to have aided in the treatment and care of horses, working with the YMCA from a base near Abbeville. In 1917 she was appointed to an army <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratory</b> which was associated with a veterinary hospital. She is listed {{as a member of the}} Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps from January to November 1918 and it has been suggested that it was her war time work that aided in her acceptance into the RCVS after the war.|$|E
25|$|In February 1912, he {{was hired}} as a {{professor}} at the bacteriology department of the University of Iași medical faculty. The department lacked a physical space and a laboratory, and for nearly thirteen years had been staffed by substitute professors. Working in a room in Corneliu Șumuleanu's chemistry department, he offered a popular course attended by doctors as well as students. In 1913, during the Second Balkan War, he was sent to the front in Bulgaria {{in order to deal with}} a cholera epidemic. Decorated with the Military Virtue Medal in gold, he returned in 1914 and began to set up a <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratory.</b> He trained the first assistants and rented and furnished a house. Although the initial 10,000 lei and the additional 3000 lei per year received from the Education Ministry were woefully inadequate, he supplemented these with personal funds, private donations and substantial grants from the health department of the Interior Ministry, managing to set up a suitable laboratory for a country that had entered World War I by 1916. His textbook of epidemiology and vaccination, coauthored with Constantin Ionescu-Mihăești and Mihai Ciucă, had come out in 1915.|$|E

In 1899 the plant genus Arechavaletaia was named in his honor by Carlos Luigi Spegazzini.|$|R
40|$|The Ba(OH) 2 {{indicator}} system was demonstrated to be a practical procedure in assisting clinical bacteriologists in the accurate and rapid {{identification of the}} pathogenic Neisseria from clinical specimens.

2500|$|In November 1893 it was {{reported}} that the Colonial Secretary, Horace Tozer, had [...] "decided to establish a Stock Institute in Brisbane for pathological and bacteriological purposes", and that , who had conducted a microscopy class in Brisbane, was preferred as scientist to take charge (Adrien Loir being unavailable). C. J. Pound FRMS had been principal assistant to Edgar Crookshank at Britain's first <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratory,</b> King's College London, and briefly studied vaccines at the Pasteur Institute in Paris. Establishment and maintenance costs were paid out of the Brands and Sheep Fund and a building in Turbot Street (Brisbane central business district) was leased for the institute.|$|E
2500|$|Depending on {{the nature}} of infection, an {{appropriate}} specimen is collected and sent to a <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratory</b> for identification. As with most bacteriological specimens, a Gram stain is performed, which may show Gram-negative rods and/or white blood cells. P. aeruginosa produces colonies with a characteristic [...] "grape-like" [...] or [...] "fresh-tortilla" [...] odor on bacteriological media. In mixed cultures, it can be isolated as clear colonies on MacConkey agar (as it does not ferment lactose) which will test positive for oxidase. Confirmatory tests include production of the blue-green pigment pyocyanin on cetrimide agar and growth at 42°C. A TSI slant is often used to distinguish nonfermenting Pseudomonas species from enteric pathogens in faecal specimens.|$|E

40|$|Mass {{spectrometry}} (MALDI-TOF/MS) is {{a recent}} technology especially adapted to identify microbial pathogens. It has rapidly established itself as a must for most medical <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratories.</b> Its ease of use and speed of execution typically permit providing pathogen identification one day earlier to the clinicians. MALDI-TOF/MS facilitates identification of filamentous fungi and mycobacteria that require particular lab expertise when using conventional methods.

40|$|A {{combination}} of lysozyme and Streptomyces albus filtrate {{has been shown}} effective in extracting group-specific antigen for all commonly occurring serologically groupable streptococci. A prospective comparison of this method with that of Rantz and Randall (1955) for grouping 761 clinical isolates has confirmed its accuracy, which in our hands exceeded that of the latter more complicated method of serogrouping. Its rapidity and simplicity and the relatively low cost of the reagents involved make it practical for routine use in clinical <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratories...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for identifying {{members of the}} family Enterobacteriaceae isolated from clinical specimens. The methods are based on primary differentiation of the various groups of bacteria by the use of Kligler Iron Agar and lysine-iron-agar.

40|$|The biochemical, serological, and {{epidemiological}} {{characteristics of}} 95 strains of Serratia marcescens isolated at the Boston City Hospital were examined.

The appearance of resistance to kanamycin and nalidixic acid among endemic strains was demonstrated. The nosocomial nature of Serratia infections, particularly those involving the urinary tract, was confirmed.

40|$|Background Infections {{caused by}} non-O 1 Vibrio cholera are uncommon.

Methods The clinical charts of all patients with non-O 1 V. cholera infections and who were treated in two hospitals in Taiwan were retrospectively reviewed.

40|$|In this study, we {{describe}} a simple method for {{the identification of}} Candida albicans in clinical samples. A total of 383 clinical isolates of Candida species were streaked onto chocolate agar and incubated for 48 h at 37 degrees C {{in the presence of}} an atmosphere of 6 % CO 2. All 208 of the C. albicans isolates tested, developed an easy to identify filamentous colony morphology. Of 175 other Candida species tested, 172 (98. 3 %) were distinguishable from C. albicans by their smooth colony morphology. Three isolates (1. 7 %) exhibited weak filamentation after prolonged incubation. Although not a routine medium in medical mycology a significant advantage of using chocolate agar lies in its use in clinical <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratories</b> for the isolation of fastidious bacteria. Implementation of the proposed method is applicable across a range of specimen types, thus allowing the direct identification of C. albicans in clinical samples. This simple method may allow a quicker entry into directed treatment...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{pathology}} laboratory {{services in the}} U. K. have experienced large increases in demand. But {{the extent to which}} U.

This paper presents the results of a survey of all 343 NHS <b>bacteriology</b> <b>laboratories</b> which records the extent to which such operations management controls are now in place. The survey shows large differences between laboratories. Quality controls over inputs, the use of screening tests as a culture substitute, the use of direct susceptibility testing, controls over routine antibiotic susceptibility testing, and controls over reporting of results all vary widely. The survey also records the prevalence of hospital antibiotic policies, the extent to which laboratories produce antibiograms for user clinicians, the degree of computerisation in data handling, and the degree of automation in processing specimens. Finally, the survey uncovers a large variation between NHS labs in the percentage of bacteriology samples which prove positive and lead to antibiotic susceptibility tests being carried out. efficiency operations management pathology laboratories automation...|$|R
