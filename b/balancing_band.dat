40|$|A recent {{trend has}} seen {{products}} marketed towards {{the health and}} fitness industry that proclaim beneficial effects through properties and mechanisms more commonly associated with complementary and alternative medicine. These claims are largely unsubstantiated {{with a lack of}} scientific research to support them. The Ionic <b>Balance</b> <b>Band</b> is one of several relatively new products that would appear to have a more plausible basis for an effect based upon the available literature. The Ionic <b>Balance</b> <b>Band</b> is claimed to improve the health and function of its wearer through generation of negative air ions, far infrared rays and alpha waves. This study investigated the efficacy of the Ionic <b>Balance</b> <b>Band</b> to improve selected health and fitness parameters following a two week exposure intervention under randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions. A sample of 60 men and women, consisting primarily of sport and exercise science students, were randomly assigned to wear an Ionic <b>Balance</b> <b>Band</b> or a placebo control band for a two week period between pre- and post-test sessions. The test battery assessed physical performance parameters of; balance, lower and upper body power, muscular strength, anaerobic power and heart rate recovery as well as cognitive function and general health outcomes. Analysis of the data revealed that no significant improvements were gained from wearing an Ionic <b>Balance</b> <b>Band</b> compared to a placebo control band for any of the parameters assessed. The results did not support the claims of improved health or function that have been anecdotally reported from wearing an Ionic <b>Balance</b> <b>Band.</b> Further research is required to evaluate and understand the broader efficacy of negative air ions, far infrared rays and alpha waves to provide beneficial effects.

40|$|Abstract—A {{frequency}} synthesizer incorporating one single-sideband (SSB) mixer generates seven bands of clock distributed from 3 to 8 GHz with 1 -ns switching time. An efficient frequency synthesizing technique producing <b>balanced</b> <b>bands</b> around one center frequency is employed, and the SSB mixer uses double degeneration topology {{to increase the}} linearity. Fabricated in 0. 18 - m CMOS technology, this circuit achieves a sideband rejection of 37 dB while consuming 48 mW from a 2. 2 -V supply. Index Terms—Frequency synthesizer, phase-locked loop (PLL), single-sideband (SSB) mixer, ultra-wideband (UWB). I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A plasma {{enhanced}} atomic layer {{deposition process}} has been demonstrated for Lanthanum oxide films using La(thd) 3 precursor and oxygen plasma. The chemical and electrical properties of La 2 O 3 ultra-thin films on Si (100) substrates before and after post-annealing in N 2 ambient have been investigated. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic revealed that interface reactions take place after annealing process which lead to oxygen insufficiency, {{as well as the}} <b>balance</b> <b>band</b> offset decreases with the increase of annealing temperature. The capacitance-voltage and current-voltage characteristics show La 2 O 3 capacitors annealed at 900 °C have negligible hysteresis, smaller interface trap density in comparison with as-deposited samples, but larger flat band voltage and higher gate-leakage current density due to the appearance of oxygen vacancy in the La 2 O 3 films...|$|R

A suggested sequence of increasingly binder-adaptive DSM steps appears herein to assist and motivate DSL service providers and equipment vendors to progress in use of DSM. In particular, studies of bounds of spectral <b>balancing</b> find <b>Band</b> Preference as a practical method that provides the highest possible Level 2 performance in bundled or unbundled DSL environments. Investigations of vectoring begin with differential vectoring and show very high DSL data rates.
