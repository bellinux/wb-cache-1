25|$|Bioprospecting is {{the process}} of {{discovery}} and commercialization of new products based on biological resources. Despite indigenous knowledge being intuitively helpful, bioprospecting has only recently begun to incorporate such knowledge in focusing screening efforts for bioactive compounds. Bioprospecting may involve <b>biopiracy,</b> the exploitative appropriation of indigenous forms of knowledge by commercial actors, and also includes the search for previously unknown compounds in organisms that have never been used in traditional medicine before.|$|E
25|$|<b>Biopiracy</b> {{describes}} a practice in which indigenous knowledge of nature, originating with indigenous peoples, {{is used by}} others for profit, without permission from and {{with little or no}} compensation or recognition to the indigenous people themselves. For example, when bioprospectors draw on indigenous knowledge of medicinal plants which is later patented by medical companies without recognizing the fact that the knowledge is not new, or invented by the patenter, and depriving the indigenous community to the rights to commercial exploitation of the technology that they themselves had developed. Critics of this practice, such as Greenpeace, claim these practices contribute to inequality between developing countries rich in biodiversity, and developed countries hosting companies that engage in 'biopiracy'.|$|E

2500|$|In {{response}} to concerns of <b>biopiracy</b> raised by research into turmeric, neem and basmati rice, the Government of India has been translating and publishing ancient manuscripts containing old remedies in electronic form, and in 2001 the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library {{was set up}} as a repository of 1200 formulations of various systems of Indian medicine, such as Ayurveda, Unani and Siddha. The texts are being recorded from Tamil, Sanskrit, Urdu, Persian and Arabic; made available to patent offices in English, German, French, Japanese and Spanish. The aim is to protect India's heritage from being exploited by foreign companies. Hundreds of yoga poses are also kept in the collection. The project has been criticized by {{a spokesman for the}} pharmaceutical industry as [...] "a solution in search of a problem". The library has also signed agreements with leading international patent offices such as European Patent Office (EPO), United Kingdom Trademark & Patent Office (UKTPO) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office to protect traditional knowledge from <b>biopiracy</b> as it allows patent examiners at International Patent Offices to access TKDL databases for patent search and examination purposes. [...] The database is not available to the general public, but the articles to which it refers are (though typically in a not widely understood language such as Sanskrit). [...] In this way the database prevents subsequent patenting without making the information to which it refers readily available for public use.|$|E
2500|$|The CBD {{came into}} force in 1993. It secured rights to control access to genetic {{resources}} for the countries in which those resources are located. One objective of the CBD is to enable lesser-developed countries to better benefit from their resources and traditional knowledge. Under {{the rules of the}} CBD, bioprospectors are required to obtain informed consent to access such resources, and must share any benefits with the biodiversity-rich country. However, some critics believe that the CBD has failed to establish appropriate regulations to prevent <b>biopiracy.</b> [...] Others claim that the main problem is the failure of national governments to pass appropriate laws implementing the provisions of the CBD. The Nagoya Protocol to the CBD (negotiated in 2010, expected to come into force in 2014) will provide further regulations. [...] The CBD has been ratified by all countries in the world except for Andorra, Holy See and United States.|$|E

50|$|Central to Shiva’s work is {{the idea}} of seed freedom, or the {{rejection}} of corporate patents on seeds. She has campaigned against the implementation of the WTO 1994 Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement, which broadens the scope of patents to include life forms. Shiva has criticised the agreement as having close ties with the corporate sector and opening the door to further patents on life. Shiva calls the patenting of life ‘biopiracy’, and has fought against attempted patents of several indigenous plants. In 2005, Shiva’s was one of the three organisations that won a 10-year battle in the European Patent Office against the <b>biopiracy</b> of Neem by the US Department of Agriculture and the corporation WR Grace. In 1998, Shiva’s organisation Navdanya began a campaign against the <b>biopiracy</b> of Basmati rice by US corporation RiceTec Inc. In 2001, following intensive campaigning, RiceTec lost most of its claims to the patent.|$|E

50|$|The Maya ICBG {{bioprospecting}} controversy {{took place}} in 1999-2000, when the International Cooperative Biodiversity Group led by ethnobiologist Dr. Brent Berlin was accused of engaging in unethical forms of bioprospecting (<b>biopiracy)</b> by several NGOs and indigenous organizations. The ICBG had as its aim to document the biodiversity of Chiapas, Mexico and the ethnobotanical knowledge of the indigenous Maya people - to ascertain whether there were possibilities of developing medical products based {{on any of the}} plants used by the indigenous groups.|$|E

50|$|Foreign {{interests}} have patented many varieties of quinoa, {{and it is}} sold globally. Due to emphasis on export-oriented production, Bolivian farmers are increasingly excluded from control or consultation over quiona genetic resources. As farmers are encouraged to cultivate market-favoring varieties, native varieties are put at risk of disappearance. As quinoa grows in popularity, the risk of <b>biopiracy</b> and patenting indigenous Andean genetic material increases. This possibility has influenced Bolivian farmers to be reluctant to work with scientist sand groups researching to improve quinoa varieties.|$|E
