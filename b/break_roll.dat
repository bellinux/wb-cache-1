40|$|The {{effect of}} enzyme in temper water on wheat milling {{performance}} and flour quality was studied. Five independent variables, enzyme concentration, incubation time, incubation temperature, tempered wheat moisture content, and tempering water pH, were studied. An enzyme cocktail consisting of cellulase, xylanase, and pectinase was used at 5 different concentrations. A single pure variety of hard red winter wheat was tempered under defined conditions following an RSM central composite design which required 33 tests including 7 replicates. Each treatment had 5 levels: high, medium high, medium, medium low, and low. After tempering, the physical {{characteristics of the}} wheat kernel were determined by using the Single Kernel Characterization System. An experimental laboratory mill (Ross Mill) was used to mill wheat into flour. Thirteen streams of flour, and additional streams of bran, shorts, red dog, and germ were obtained. Product yield, protein, ash, and flour color were evaluated. The data were analyzed and compared using the software SAS and RSM Plus. The data showed that incubation time was the only significant factor affecting the tempered wheat hardness (p< 0. 05). The treatments affected the flour yield from the <b>break</b> <b>roll...</b>|$|E
40|$|Children’s {{acquisition}} of the transitivity status of novel verbs was examined to test whether preemption helps children learn to avoid non-conventional uses of verbs. Given that many English verbs alternate between transitive and intransitive usage (e. g. <b>break,</b> <b>roll),</b> how do children learn the fixed transitive status of verbs such as hit or the fixed intransitive status of verbs such as fall? 48 four-year-olds and 48 six-and seven-year-olds learned two novel verbs, with one verb modelled as transitive and the other as intransitive. Exposure conditions varied the occurrence and type of preemptive evidence potentially facilitating learning of the verbs ’ transitivity status. In comparison to a No Preemption group, only six- to seven-year-olds exposed to novel verbs in alternative constructions (that allowed them {{to talk about the}} actions {{from the perspective of the}} agent or patient without changing the verbs’ assigned transitivity) produced fewer utterances violating the verbs’ fixed transitivity. The results identify limits in children’s usage of indirect negative evidence in acquiring verb argument structure con-structions. introduction Children seem to learn languages faster, and more effortlessly than most adults.

40|$|Despite {{considerable}} {{gains in}} wheat flour milling yield through conventional breeding strategies and milling technologies, the theoretical maximum yield {{still has not}} been attained. Discovery of genes in wheat that control flour yield would provide a means for breeders to develop new wheats that fulfill their potential in relation to this trait. A more targeted approach {{is to improve the}} understanding of the role of grain microstructure in determining high flour yield. Previous research has shown that increased flour yield in hard wheat is associated with increased endosperm rheology index, calculated from strength and stiffness as measured by the SKCS (Osborne et al, 2005; Osborne et al, 2007). Edwards et al (2007) demonstrated, through microscopy and particle size analysis of the crushed material from the SKCS 4100 and a first <b>break</b> <b>roll</b> stand, that the SKCS data for unconditioned wheat averaged over 300 grains provided a useful indicator of milling performance of a wheat sample. The Pina-D 1 and Pinb-D 1 alleles, tightly linked to the Ha locus on the short arm of Chromosome 5 D, determine the hardness phenotype (Greenwell and Schofield, 1986). However, this does not fully account for the observed genetic variation in hardness, especially within each hardness class, and it is thought that additional modifying genes account for the range of hardness within hard or soft classes (Martin et al, 2001). Others have investigated the relationship between endosperm starch granule size and hardness. Igrejas et al (2002) reported that harder wheat had a higher content of small starch granules but could not find a QTL for starch granule size on the 5 D Chromosome; they concluded that “starch size distribution is influenced by genes which have yet to be analysed”. The aim {{of the present study was}} to test the hypothesis that a genetic association exists in hard wheat between starch granule type and flour yield...|$|E
