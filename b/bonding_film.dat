50|$|The fourth EVA of Volkov's {{career was}} during Expedition 46, with veteran {{cosmonaut}} Yuri Malenchenko. The spacewalkers performed {{works with the}} experiment Test at two locations: they took away samples from the outer surface of the docking compartment Pirs hatch and {{in the area of}} the cover window #8 at the service module Zvezda. The goal of the experiments was to develop methods for detecting leaks and control of elements of the exterior surface of the ISS.The cosmonauts also dismantled a monoblock responsible for exposing samples of organic and biological materials in open space (experiment Expose-R) and set the unit samples #2 from an experiment for the study of space influence on the mechanical properties of materials. At the same module, they had to replace a removable cassette container, where the samples are placed on the exterior of stations in conditions of prolonged exposure, change the orientation of the pressure control unit on the module Poisk.One of the important tasks were works on an experiment with the goal to develop technologies for sticking film thermal control coating, secure package screen-vacuum thermal insulation on the surface to be repaired and transactions that require <b>bonding</b> <b>film</b> materials in space flight.For more convenient travel on the outer surface of the ISS the spacewalkers installed handrails on the soft part of the conical device of the Functional Cargo Block Zarya. Upon completion of the main tasks, the cosmonauts started a photo documentation of the external surface of the ISS Russian segment. The spacewalk concluded after 4 hours 45 minutes.|$|E

40|$|The co-products {{produced}} in the processing industry of Dosidicus gigas muscle, is {{a good source of}} polymeric material for film developing. The objective of this work was to compare different ways of protein recovery to find the best conditions of material for edible film developing. The proteins were recovered by water, salt, alkaline and acidic solubilisation. The highest protein solubilisation was obtained at alkaline conditions (≥ 70 %) and DSC confirmed a partial denaturalization in saline and alkaline solution and total at acidic conditions, while SDS-PAGE confirmed a hydrolysis effect at pH 3. According to FTIR, the loss of secondary structure at pH 10 led to a stronger <b>bonding</b> <b>film</b> network and the hydrolysis at pH 3 resulted in more protein-plasticizer and protein-water interactions. Both alkaline and acidic conditions led to transparent and microbiologically stable films, the alkaline-film being more water resistant and with less protein release in water contact. Both alkaline- and acidic-films resulted in the more flexible and more resistant, especially at alkaline conditions. While salt-extract did not improve any mechanical property of the corresponding film compared with water-film, both films presented the lower solubility and the more water resistance but were not microbiologically stable and had poorer mechanical properties. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Traditional {{multilayer}} (ML) circuitry provides increased den-sity, reduced {{signal path}} and optimum high speed performance re-quired for today's electronic assemblies. Products ranging from supercomputers to automotive engine controllers now depend on multilayer technology. But the modern multilayer circuit, with its full length Plated-Through Boles (PTH), {{is a highly}} stressed structure, prone to del-amination, barrel fracture and other modes of self [...] destruction. The plating of copper into smaller and smaller diameter holes, of ever increasing length, has brought us close to the practical lim-its of this technology. Cumulative stress and plating limitations combine to make layer count and yield an inverse relationship. Worse yet, reliability is often dramatically compromised as layer count increases. Advances in anisotropic bonding materials and a fresh approach to ML constructions, now make a reliable 100 - layer circuit pos-sible. Stress-free multilayer circuitry can now be fabricated in a simple process utilizing anisotropic technology and other inter-connects. Multilayer circuitry is fabricated by laminating double-sided circuits together with special anisotropic <b>bonding</b> <b>film.</b> Opposing conductor pads on adjacent layers are electrically connected and mechanically bonded during the laminating process. Solder microspheres, dispersed within a dimensionally stable thermosetting dielectric adhesive, provide permanent interlayer connections. A host of benefits accrue for most applications without penal-ties. Reduced cost and increased reliability are key attributes of the new process. A remarkable characteristic of the construc-tion is that stress is non-cumulative and totally independent of the layer count. The resulting interconnection is remarkably du-rable and easily passes MIL- 50884 -C criteria. Blind and buried vial are an intrinsic feapire of the process with no extra steps or added cost. The Z-LINK { 	 process will be thoroughly described...|$|E
