50|$|In {{the ancient}} past, {{the valley floor}} was blocked. This caused a {{residual}} alluvial deposit, which resulted in relatively deep and fertile soils. The tall mountain <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> deanei) trees in the gully may reach 50 m in height.

Additionally, the outside land was covered with sand dunes which needed to be reclaimed and replaced by forest trees. 60,000 trees had been planted by 1875 (<b>Blue</b> Gum <b>Eucalyptus,</b> Monterey pine and Monterey cypress). Plantings continued and there were 155,000 trees planted by 1879.|$|R

50|$|The main {{trees in}} the {{southern}} part of the forest are Messmate (Eucalyptus oblique), Manna Gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> viminalis), and <b>Blue</b> Gums (<b>Eucalyptus</b> st johnii). In the north, which is drier, there are Yellow Box (Eucalyptus melliodora), and Red Stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorryncha). There is also the rare Mount Cole Grevillea, Grevillea montis-cole. On the high peaks there are groups of Snow Gums (Eucalyptus pauciflora).|$|R
50|$|The {{reserve is}} the most {{significant}} remnant of the <b>eucalyptus</b> <b>Blue</b> Gum High Forest which dominated much of the shale based forests north of Sydney. Only 1% of the original forest remains.|$|R
5000|$|Blue gum - {{peppermint}} dry grass/shrub forest. This ecosystem {{exists on}} soils underlain by granite rock. Common plant species include <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> bicostata), broad-leaved peppermint (Eucalyptus dives), red stringybark (Eucalyptus macrorhyncha), narrow-leaved peppermint (Eucalyptus robertsonii ssp. robertsonii), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata), shiny cassinia (Cassinia longifolia), Austral bracken fern (Pteridium esculentum), guinea flower (Hibbertia obtusifolia), prickly broom-heath (Monotoca scoparia) and snow grass (Poa sp.).|$|R
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{eucalyptus}} trees dominate areas of this large ecoregion, including: in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales - tallowwood (Eucalyptus microcorys), blackbutt (Eucalyptus pilularis), brush box (Lophostemon confertus), flooded gum (Eucalyptus grandis), and Gympie messmate (Eucalyptus cloeziana); southern New South Wales - Sydney <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> saligna), the grey ironbark (Eucalyptus paniculata), and blackbutt; {{and on the}} New South Wales coast a stringybark (Eucalyptus eugenioides).|$|R
50|$|Eucryphia lucida, {{commonly}} known as leatherwood is a species of trees or large shrubs endemic to forests of western Tasmania. An attractive plant utilised in both the horticulture and apiculture industries, it was promoted by the Tasmanian Branch of the then SGAP {{as an alternative to}} the Tasmanian <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus) for Tasmania's floral emblem. It was described as E. billiarderi at one stage, this now being a synonym.|$|R
5000|$|Riparian gully forest. This {{ecosystem}} {{exist on}} deep colluvium or soils underlain by granite rock. Common plant species include black wattle (Acacia melanoxylon), <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> bicostata), apple box (Eucalyptus bridgesiana), Austral mulberry (Hedycarya angustifolia), Austral bracken fern (Pteridium esculentum), silver wattle (Acacia dealbata), hazel pomaderris (Pomaderris aspera), shiny cassinia (Cassinia longifolia), weeping grass (Microlaena stipoides var. stipoides), snow grass (Poa meionectes), Senecio species and common wheatgrass (Elymus scaber var. scaber).|$|R
50|$|Commersonia fraseri {{is found}} in {{rainforest}} and wet eucalypt forest along and east of the Great Dividing Range in New South Wales and southeastern Queensland. In the latter habitat, it is associated with trees such as rough-barked apple (Angophora floribunda), turpentine (Syncarpia glomulifera), and Sydney <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> saligna). A fast-growing plant, {{it is able to}} colonise disturbed ground, particularly areas where vegetation has been partly cleared such as under power lines.|$|R
50|$|There O'Keefe Open Space Preserve {{protects the}} {{riparian}} habitat along an 800 foot {{section of the}} creek below I-280. It is an 8.2 acre nature preserve. This section of the creek has been invaded by non-native species that compete with the native vegetation for its water, including Canary Island Palms (Phoenix canariensis), Common fig (Ficus carica), Plum (Prunus), <b>Blue</b> Gum <b>Eucalyptus</b> (Eucalytpus globulus), European Olive (Olea europaea) and Siberian Elm (Ulmus pumila).|$|R
50|$|Thousands of <b>Blue</b> Gum <b>Eucalyptus</b> {{trees were}} {{planted on the}} Nipomo Mesa in 1908 by two men who formed the Los Berros Forest Company {{with the idea of}} selling the trees as hardwood. Groves of these {{non-native}} trees still exist, even in rows as they were originally planted. These tall trees are often removed as needed for space, but also since they present a falling hazard during high winds and can suppress native flora.|$|R
5000|$|The forest {{consists}} predominantly of towering Mountain <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> deanei) trees, with an understory of shrubs. The forest can {{be accessed}} only on foot, with several trails {{from different parts of}} the Grose Valley and adjacent canyons meeting in the forest. The most direct route into the forest from Blackheath is by the Perrys Lookdown track, which descends 656 m to the forest. The return walk uphill is rated as [...] "hard".|$|R
50|$|The Parade is {{flanked by}} Victorian <b>blue</b> gum <b>eucalyptus</b> trees on gently sloping banks {{either side of the}} three-lane, one-way roads centred by a wide parade ground topped with {{granulated}} rock (similar to scoria), with planted boxes of a low bush called Hebe. The eucalypts are Australian; and the hebe comes from New Zealand. The Parade is also flanked by the streets of Anzac Park West and Anzac Park East on either side of Anzac Park.|$|R
5000|$|Eucalyptus grandis {{was first}} {{described}} by W. Hill in 1862. The species name grandis [...] "large" [...] relates to this tree's large size. It is {{commonly known as}} the flooded gum, and is also called rose gum in Queensland. It has been classified in the subgenus Symphyomyrtus, Section Latoangulatae, Series Transversae (eastern blue gums) by Brooker and Kleinig. Its two closest relatives are the Sydney <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> saligna) and the mountain blue gum (E. deanei).|$|R
5000|$|The {{region is}} noted for agriculture, principally wheat, sheep (wool and meat), beef cattle, wine, canola and olives. Silviculture, {{especially}} plantations of Tasmanian <b>Blue</b> Gums (<b>Eucalyptus</b> globulus), {{was a major}} industry in the shire although some recent silviculture enterprises (Great Southern Plantations and Timbercorp) [...] have gone into receivership. Local tourist attractions include the Porongurup Range and Stirling Range, a museum based within the original police station, and other pioneer structures such as St Werburghs Chapel.|$|R
500|$|Widely found native reeds, sedges {{and rushes}} along the upper river are bulrush, knobby club rush, spike rush, common reed, sea rush and pale rush. River red gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> camaldulensis) and <b>blue</b> gum (<b>Eucalyptus</b> leucoxylon) trees are found along the riverbanks, {{although}} sparser than the forest that {{was seen by}} European discoverers. Still present are many of the original vegetation species like: Sheoak (Casuarina stricta), native cherry (Exocarpos cupressiformis), native pine (Callitris preissii) and Australia's floral emblem the golden wattle (Acacia pycnantha) ...|$|R
