40|$|Endophytic fungi were {{isolated}} from the medicinal plants Nothapodyte foetida and Hypericum mysorense, collected from the cold peaks of the Western Ghats of India, which is considered as one among ten important biodiversity hotspots of the world. The diversity of foliar endophytic biota in both plants was assessed using various indices. Endophytes were screened for the antimicrobial and free radical-scavenging activity. Ethyl acetate extracts of the culture broths of two isolates Bionectria ochroleuca NOTL 33 from N. foetida and Chaetomium globosum HYML 55 from H. mysorense were further characterized for their composition and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) based on their significant activities during primary screening. MIC of both extracts ranged from 78 to 625 µg/ml, {{with the exception of}} Pseudomonas aeruginosa (5 mg/ml). 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and 2, 2 ’-azinobis- 3 -ethylbenzothiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid (ABTS) free radical quenching by the extracts were dose dependent. 2 -heptanone, furfural, methyl furfural, benzyl pentyl ketone, <b>benzyl</b> <b>decanoate,</b> amyl isovalerate and palmitic acid were identified in NOTL 33 extract by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis. A yellow amorphous powder (HYML 8 A) was purified from HYML 55 extract and further characterized for MIC and minimum cidal concentrations against the test bacteria. The yield of the compound in different media was estimated...|$|E
40|$|Micelles are {{aggregates}} of surfactant molecules used {{to increase}} the solubility and bioavailability of poorly soluble pharmaceutical compounds. Past {{studies have suggested that}} a micelle is an oil droplet surrounded by a layer of water. To further investigate the microenvironment of a micelle, the thickness of water penetration was not clearly understood. To study the mechanism of micellar solubilization, we have purchased and synthesized several benzyl esters derivatives. Alkyl chain length of the acid segment was increased from one as in benzyl acetate to ten carbons as in <b>benzyl</b> <b>decanoate.</b> Partition coefficients of each benzyl ester were determined from kinetic data using pseudo phase mathematical model. Degradation studies were conducted using borate buffer at pH 9 and constant temperature (40 ºC). Surfactants (SDS) were dissolved in the buffer solution at varying concentrations to extend the concentration range below and above the critical micelle concentration. Reaction products were analyzed using high performance liquid chromatography HPLC and detected using UV detector at 254 nm. Hydrolysis reaction rate constants followed pseudo first order mechanism. Rate constants decreased as the surfactant concentrations have increased. Also, water solubility decreased as the alkyl chain length was increased which consequently caused the water-micelle partition coefficients to increase. To further understand the interaction between benzyl esters and micelles we introduced a linear interaction model where we proposed that each benzyl ester will fit into the micelle with linear orientation where the alkyl chain is pointed towards the core interacting with the hydrophobic region while the benzene ring is located in the hydrophilic region of the micelle...|$|E
