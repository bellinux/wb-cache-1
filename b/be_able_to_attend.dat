5|$|Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Sheldon, Raj (Kunal Nayyar) and Howard (Simon Helberg) are in Leonard and Sheldon's apartment, {{waiting for}} Comic-Con tickets {{to go on}} sale online. After ten minutes of trying, Leonard finally gets in the queue but is 15,211th in line. Tickets run out and the four men are {{disappointed}} {{that they will not}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend,</b> especially as they had spent so much time on their costumes, intending to go as different versions of the Hulk as portrayed by Lou Ferrigno, Eric Bana, Edward Norton, and Mark Ruffalo.|$|E
5|$|Roy faced {{challenges}} {{before entering}} college. His parents {{and his older}} brother had not attended college, and due to a learning disability Roy had difficulty with the SAT; his reading comprehension was slow, which increased the time he needed for tests. He had taken the test four times (with tutors) before finally meeting the NCAA requirements. Unsure whether he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> a four-year college, Roy worked on the Seattle docks, cleaning shipping containers for $11/hour.|$|E
5|$|Squidward gets a {{call from}} his former high school classmate, Squilliam Fancyson, who is very {{successful}} and has succeeded in everything in which Squidward has failed, such as music. Squilliam reveals to Squidward that he has become {{the leader of a}} band and that they are supposed to play at the Bubble Bowl; but he will be busy at that time and will not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> so Squilliam asks Squidward to allow his band to substitute for his at the Bubble Bowl, believing that Squidward does not have one. However, Squidward insists that he has a band and accepts the offer. He assembles a large marching band composed of various Bikini Bottom residents.|$|E

5|$|The {{birth of}} her {{daughter}} in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention {{to be held in}} Providence, but because she would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> it, she handed responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony’s plan to move the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman’s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the terms}} agreed in December 1974, the talks between the Rhodesian {{government}} and the UANC were to take place within Rhodesia, but in the event the black nationalist leaders were loath to attend a conference on ground they perceived as not neutral. The Rhodesians, however, were keen {{to adhere to the}} accord and meet at a Rhodesian venue. In an effort to placate both sides, Kaunda and Vorster relaxed the terms so that the two sides would instead meet aboard a train provided by the South African government, placed halfway across the Victoria Falls Bridge, on the Rhodesian–Zambian border. The Rhodesian delegates could therefore take their seats in Rhodesia and the nationalists, {{on the opposite side of}} the carriage, would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> without leaving Zambia. As part of the détente policy, Kaunda and Vorster would act as mediators in the conference, which was set for 26 August 1975.|$|E
5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend.</b> As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and to go ahead and fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi {{was the only one who}} wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event.|$|E

25|$|The {{plan was}} for {{education}} of children in three successive stages corresponding with three types of schools: primary schools, which all children, regardless of their parents' financial ability, would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> {{for at least three}} years; intermediate schools, for students who excelled in primary school, as well as for children whose parents are willing and able to pay for it; and the university, for students whose parents were willing to pay.|$|E

Beginning with the merest elements, he led his hearers on until, almost unknown to themselves, they were themselves extending the bounds of the subject: above all he impressed on his pupils the advantage of always using general methods expressed in a symmetrical notation.|$|E
25|$|Only 15% of {{high school}} {{students}} are admitted to college in China, so the entrance exams are fiercely competitive and those who do enter university graduate at a rate of 99%. Much pressure is put on children and adolescents to study and <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> college and this pressure is a central school counseling focus in China. An additional stressor is that there are not enough places for students to attend college, and over 1/3 of college graduates cannot find jobs, so career and employment counseling and development are central in school counseling.|$|E
25|$|The {{demand for}} seats always exceeds the number available. Members {{of the public}} are {{admitted}} to the College through the main gate on King's Parade from 7:30 am (though some start queueing the night before), and each person is given an information leaflet which must be retained and shown to the duty porter for re-entry {{if he or she}} desires to leave the queue temporarily. People joining the queue before 9:00 am will usually gain admission to the Chapel, but this is not guaranteed. Porters monitor the number of people joining the queue, and once there are as many people as there are seats available, the others are advised that it is unlikely they will <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> the service. Members of Collegium Regale (the Choral Scholars of King's College Choir) usually sing Christmas carols to entertain the people who are queueing.|$|E

500|$|The old village church {{from the}} 14th century {{is now known}} as The Sand-Covered Church as only its tower can still be seen. [...] Sand began {{drifting}} in from Råbjerg Mile around 1600, the area surrounding the church becoming affected by the desertification which destroyed the fields. In 1775, the church door had to be dug free for the congregation to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend</b> the service, and for the following 20 years, the Skageners struggled to keep the church free from sand, without being allowed to close it down. In 1795 the church was closed by royal decree and the body of the church demolished.|$|E

500|$|As such, three {{candidates}} {{appeared on the}} general election ballot: Peduto, Wander and Ludwig. From the outset, Peduto was heavily favored by local media and political observers {{to win the election}} owing to the Democratic Party's voter registration advantage in Pittsburgh, although Wander stated that it was not his sole intention to win the race, but rather to [...] "convey a message that there is a choice." [...] Two debates had been scheduled in October 2013, but Wander—who had been running his campaign from Israel, where he was working as a security consultant—and Ludwig did not attend. As a result, Peduto was the only candidate to attend the events, reformatting them as town hall events, and local television station WTAE-TV cancelled an October 29 debate as Wander did not confirm that he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>attend.</b> Ultimately, Bill Peduto defeated both Wander and Ludwig to be elected as the 60th Mayor of Pittsburgh and was inaugurated to succeed Luke Ravenstahl in January 2014.|$|E

[...] Tom leaves the canvassing group to call prospective contractors about the park project, hinting at accepting bribes and making corrupt deals. [...] Several residents express a lack of support for the park. [...] Resident Kate Speevak (Lennon Parham) vows to attend the public meeting and voice her disapproval after a frustrated Leslie says, [...] "You don't care about your kids if you don't support this park".
