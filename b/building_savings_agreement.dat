In previous development, {{it comes to the}} permanently increasing growth in the market of deposits and loans of <b>building</b> <b>saving.</b> 2. 	Concentration in the market of <b>building</b> <b>saving</b> decreases. Analyses is made on two partial markets : deposit market and market of <b>building</b> <b>saving</b> loans.
