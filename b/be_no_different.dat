5|$|R.I.P. 35E {{and other}} citizens' groups {{continued}} to oppose a direct connection, {{arguing that it}} would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from a typical freeway, since drivers {{would be more likely}} to exceed the speed limit if it was a continuous roadway to I-94. Saint Paul changed its mind again in September 1981, supporting a direct connection, along with Mn/DOT and the Metropolitan Council. A bill passed in March 1982 removed the stipulation that the parkway shall not connect to I-94, and allowed Route390 (I-35E) to use Route382 (the parkway). The final EIS was approved at about that time, and several groups including R.I.P. 35E filed suit in early 1983.|$|E

25|$|Detroit had {{defeated}} Dallas 34–10 in {{the regular}} season, and this meeting would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> Quarterback Erik Kramer led the Lions to their first postseason victory since 1957 by completing 29 out of 38 passes for 341 yards and three touchdowns. Dallas quarterback Steve Beuerlein completed just seven of 13 passes for 91 yards and an interception, before being replaced by Troy Aikman, who was unable to lead the team to any points after stepping on the field. Overall, Detroit outgained the Cowboys in total yards 421-276 and forced four turnovers, without losing any of their own.|$|E
25|$|A {{naltrexone}} treatment {{study by}} Anton et al., {{released by the}} National Institutes of Health in February 2008 and published in the Archives of General Psychiatry, has shown that alcoholics having a certain variant of the opioid receptor gene (G polymorphism of SNP Rs1799971 in the gene OPRM1), known as Asp40, demonstrated strong response to naltrexone and were {{far more likely to}} experience success at cutting back or discontinuing their alcohol intake altogether, while for those lacking the gene variant, naltrexone appeared to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from placebo. The G allele of OPRM1 is most common in individuals of Asian descent, with 60% to 70% of people of Chinese, Japanese, and Indian ancestry having at least one copy, as opposed to 30% of Europeans and few Africans.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{his support}} among {{elements}} of the party, Zuma remained a powerful political figure, retaining a high position in the ANC even after his dismissal as the country's deputy president. A panel of political analysts convened in November 2005 agreed {{that if he was}} to be found innocent of the corruption charges brought against him, {{it would be hard for}} any other potential ANC candidate to beat Zuma in the race for the country's presidency in 2009. However, these analysts also questioned whether Zuma was indeed a left-wing candidate of the sort that many of his supporters seem to seek, and noted that the global and national economic constraints that have shaped Mbeki's presidency would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> in the next presidential term.|$|E

25|$|Women {{were also}} {{distinct}} {{because of the}} titles by which they were addressed in the army, although these tended to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from their male counterparts. They wore the same rank insignia as their male counterparts. Many members of the ATS were respected by the units they were attached to despite their different insignia. The only major difference between an ATS member and a male member of the Regular Army was discipline: a woman {{was not allowed to}} be court marshalled unless she herself chose to be. The women in the service were also under the authority of the women officers of the ATS, instead of the male officers they served directly under. This meant any disciplinary action was entirely {{in the hands of the}} ATS, removing male influence from the process.|$|E
25|$|People {{with early}} {{keratoconus}} typically notice a minor blurring of their vision {{and come to}} their clinician seeking corrective lenses for reading or driving. At early stages, the symptoms of keratoconus may <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from those of any other refractive defect of the eye. As the disease progresses, vision deteriorates, sometimes rapidly. Visual acuity becomes impaired at all distances, and night vision is often poor. Some individuals have vision in one eye that is markedly worse than that in the other. The disease is often bilateral, though asymmetrical. Some develop photophobia (sensitivity to bright light), eye strain from squinting in order to read, or itching in the eye, but there is normally little or no sensation of pain. It may cause luminous objects to appear as cylindrical pipes with the same intensity at all points.|$|E
500|$|Carl Meissner placed B.caleyi {{in series}} Quercinae in his 1856 {{arrangement}} of the genus on account of its strongly dentate, cuneate to obovate leaves. As they were defined on leaf characters alone, all of Meissner's series were highly heterogeneous. Meissner also described B.caleyi variety sinuosa from material collected by James Drummond, which was reviewed by Alex George and found to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from the other collections of B.caleyi. Drummond also collected material identified as B.caleyi that was named as a distinct species—Banksia aculeata—in 1981. No subspecies of [...] B.caleyi itself are recognised.|$|E

Nylund had 15 weeks to write the book, as opposed to the 7 weeks for , but he claimed he still [...] "lost sleep... ate a bunch of chocolate and drank too much coffee." [...] Tor's editors also had more time than those of Del Rey and helped [...] "untangle" [...] the complicated plot of Onyx. On writing, Nylund pointed out that [...] "tension is the cornerstone of any good story", and that Ghosts of Onyx would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b>|$|E
500|$|On July 17, 2011, Cordray was {{selected}} over Warren {{as the head}} of the entire CFPB. However, his nomination was immediately in jeopardy because 44 Senate Republicans had previously vowed to derail any nominee in order to push for a decentralized structure to the organization. [...] This was part of a pattern of conflict between Republicans in the Senate and the Obama administration that had led to record numbers of blocked and failed nominations. On July 21, 2011, Senator Richard Shelby wrote an op-ed article for The Wall Street Journal affirming continued opposition (that went back to a May 5 letter to the President) to a centralized structure, noting that both the Securities Exchange Commission and Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had executive boards and that the CFPB should <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> Politico interpreted Shelby's statements as saying that Cordray's nomination was [...] "Dead on Arrival". In October, as the nomination continued to be on hold, the National Association of Attorneys General endorsed Cordray. On December 8, 2011, the Senate failed to secure cloture on Cordray's nomination. The final vote was 53-45, with 50 out of 51 Democrats voting for cloture, and 45 out of 47 Republicans voting against.|$|E
500|$|On September 10, Eleanor Roosevelt, {{the late}} president's widow and the gubernatorial candidate's mother, arrived in California {{for a quick}} {{campaign}} swing to support her son and Douglas before she {{had to return to}} New York as a delegate to the United Nations. Douglas hoped that the former first lady's visit would mark {{a turning point in the}} campaign. At a Democratic rally featuring Mrs. Roosevelt the next day in Long Beach, Nixon workers first handed out a flyer headed [...] "Douglas–Marcantonio Voting Record", printed with dark ink on pink paper. The legal-size flyer compared the voting records of Douglas and Marcantonio, principally in the area of national security, and concluded that they were indistinguishable. In contrast, the flyer said, Nixon had voted entirely in opposition to the [...] "Douglas–Marcantonio Axis". It implied that sending Douglas to the Senate would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from electing Marcantonio, and asked if that was what Californians wanted. The paper soon became known as the [...] "Pink Sheet". Chotiner later stated that the color choice was made at the print shop when campaign officials approved the final copy, and [...] "for some reason or other it just seemed to appeal to us for the moment". An initial print run of 50,000 was soon followed by a reprint of 500,000, distributed principally in heavily populated Southern California.|$|E

500|$|The costumes {{go through}} a natural {{evolution}} in the series. There is a shift {{at the end of}} the first season to a darker look, and all the characters have [...] "definitely grown up" [...] during the second season. In the third season [...] there is another shift, [...] "from the ragtag group of soldiers and scientists to [...] more precise militaristic outfit". This change is also reflected in the series' color palette, going from [...] "a much lighter tone, much more patterns" [...] in the first season to having [...] "stripped away a bit of color" [...] by the third. Despite this increasing darkness in the costumes, Foley intended to define each character as they are introduced and to have them always be recognizable and identifiable. With the start of the fourth season, Foley said that [...] "each season definitely has its own feel and this season will <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> I think that you're going to see some subtle differences in the costumes of the characters"; she felt like Fitz and Simmons, in particular, had become [...] "more adult looking", while all the cast had [...] "a pretty specific ... civilian look" [...] that would become more prominent as S.H.I.E.L.D. is re-legitimized and becomes more public. Foley left the series after the thirteenth episode of the fourth season, to work on a television adaptation of Altered Carbon, and was replaced with Amanda Riley. Riley used her previous experience recreating costumes to [...] "blend in" [...] with Foley's established look.|$|E

2500|$|In most countries, it {{is legal}} for three or more people to form and share a sexual {{relationship}} (subject sometimes to laws against homosexuality or adultery if {{two of the three}} are married). About 25% of countries recognize marriages between a man and more than one woman, although with only minor exceptions no developed countries permit marriage among more than two people, nor do the majority of countries give legal protection (e.g., of rights relating to children) to non-married partners. Individuals involved in polyamorous relationships are generally considered by the law to <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> from people who live together, or [...] "date", under other circumstances. In 2017 John Alejandro Rodriguez, Victor Hugo Prada, and Manuel Jose Bermudez were married in Colombia, thus becoming Colombia's first polyamorous family to have a legally recognized relationship.|$|E

2500|$|Donegal's defence {{of their}} All-Ireland title began against Tyrone on 26 May 2013.

Donegal brushed aside Tyrone with {{relative}} ease. McGuinness said afterwards: [...] "In {{the last two years}} the exact same thing was said. The only difference this year was that we were relegated [...] There was {{a lot of talk about}} putting all the eggs into one basket, but it was the same last year and the same the year before. That's what we do – it's championship football. It will <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different</b> next year. It was a media spin that got the whole debate going. Next year we will put all our eggs in that basket again." ...|$|E
2500|$|On May 16, 1912, Senator Augustus Octavius Bacon of Georgia {{submitted}} a {{resolution in the}} U.S. Senate authorizing private persons to construct a memorial to Butt and Millet on federally owned land somewhere in the District of Columbia. [...] Bacon argued that Butt (who was an aide to the president) and Millet (who was {{vice chair of the}} United States Commission of Fine Arts {{at the time of his}} death) were both public servants who deserved to be memorialized separately from the rest of the dead. Bacon also said that a number of memorials in the city had been financed by private dollars, and the Butt-Millet memorial would <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>different.</b> As originally introduced, the resolution barred the memorial from being placed on the grounds of the Capitol, Library of Congress, or White House. Bacon asked that the resolution be adopted by the Senate immediately, but Senator William Borah objected and the resolution was referred to the Committee on the Library (which had the authority to accept any work of the fine art on behalf of Congress and designate a location for its placement).|$|E
