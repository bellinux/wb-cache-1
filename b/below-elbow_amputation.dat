40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} intermanual transfer {{effects in}} patients with a <b>below-elbow</b> <b>amputation</b> using a myoelectric prosthesis, and to establish whether laterality affects these effects. DESIGN: Case-control. SETTING: A standardized setting in a rehabilitation clinic. PARTICIPANTS: A convenience sample of experienced myoelectric prosthesis users (n= 22) and matched controls (n= 22). Controls were matched on sex, age (+/- 5 years) and hand dominance. INTERVENTIONS: Both the experienced group and the control group performed several tasks using a prosthesis simulator attached to their non-affected arm. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: movement time, force control, Box and Blocks test (BBT) -scores and duration of hand opening. RESULTS: Movement times of myoelectric prosthesis users were shorter and these users had significantly higher BBT-scores and shorter hand opening durations compared to controls. No intermanual transfer effects on force control and no laterality effects were found. CONCLUSION: Intermanual transfer effects were present in experienced myoelectric prosthesis users with a <b>below-elbow</b> <b>amputation,</b> independent of laterality. These findings support the clinical relevance of intermanual transfer training, which may facilitate persons with an upper limb amputation to start training directly after the amputation...|$|E

40|$|As the {{development}} of dexterous prosthetic hand and wrist units continues, {{there is a need}} for command interfaces that will enable a user to operate these multi-joint devices in a natural, coordinated manner. In this study, myoelectric signals and hand kinematics were recorded as three able-bodied subjects performed a variety of individuated movements and simulated functional tasks. Time-delayed artificial neural networks (TDANNs) were designed to simultaneously decode the movement trajectories for seven distal degrees of freedom (pronation-supination, wrist ulnar-radial deviation, wrist flexion-extension, thumb rotation, thumb abduction-adduction, finger MCP flexion-extension, and finger PIP flexion-extension). Performance was quantified by calculating the variance accounted for (VAF) and normalized root-mean-square error (NRMSE) between the decoded and actual movements. Accurate predictions were achieved (VAF: 0. 57 - 0. 80, NRMSE: 0. 04 - 0. 11), suggesting that it may be possible to provide an intuitive EMG-based scheme that provides continuous and simultaneous multi-joint control for individuals with <b>below-elbow</b> <b>amputations...</b>|$|R

We report the functional benefits achieved over a mean follow-up period of 7. 6 years (range 4 - 13 years), up to December 31 st, 2013. Clinical measurement is hampered {{by the lack of}} specific validated assessment tools, obliging us to use non-specific standardized evaluation means. Our assessment shows that the restoration of motion, strength, and sensibility are fair. Functional results (Carroll upper extremity function test, 400 -point test, Activities of daily living) are good, as well as quality of life evaluation (RAND- 36). Subjective and overall results explored with questionnaires - Disabilities of the Arm Shoulder and Hand (DASH), Hand Transplantation Score System (HTSS), are very good. Improvement was seen to continue during the first three years, and then tend to become stable. Continued efforts should be directed at designing comprehensive, condition-specific, reliable outcome measurement tools.

40|$|Purpose: To {{develop a}} system for refined motor control of {{artificial}} hands based on multiple electromyographic (EMG) recordings, allowing multiple patterns of hand movements. Methods: Five subjects with traumatic <b>below-elbow</b> <b>amputations</b> and 1 subject with a congenital below-elbow failure of formation performed 10 imaginary movements with their phantom hand while surface electrodes recorded the EMG data. In a training phase a data glove with 18 degrees of freedom was used for positional recording of movements in the contralateral healthy hand. These movements were performed {{at the same time}} as the imaginary movements in the phantom hand. An artificial neural network (ANN) then could be trained to associate the specific EMG patterns recorded from the amputation stump with the analogous specific hand movements synchronously performed in the healthy hand. The ability of the ANN to predict the 10 imaginary movements off line, when they were reflected in a virtual computer hand, was assessed and calculated. Results: After the ANN was trained the subjects were able to perform and control 10 hand movements in the virtual computer hand. The subjects showed a median performance of 5 types of movement with a high correlation with the movement pattern of the data glove. The subjects seemed to relearn to execute motor commands rapidly that had been learned before the accident, independent of how old the injury was. The subject with congenital below-elbow failure of formation was able to perform and control several hand movements in the computer hand that cannot be performed in a myoelectric prosthesis (eg, opposition of the thumb). Conclusions: With the combined use of an ANN and a data glove, acting in concert in a training phase, amputees rapidly can learn to execute several imaginary movements in a virtual computerized hand, this opens promising possibilities for motor control of future hand prostheses...|$|R
40|$|Total {{scaphoid}} excision and radial advancement osteotomy {{has been}} investigated in a eadaverie and clinical study. In three <b>below-elbow</b> fresh <b>amputation</b> specimens, the technique was utilized and stability was checked by radiographs. Instability on ulnar deviation was prevented by extensor carpi radialis longus tenodesis. Four patients were treated in this way. The wrist was immobilized in a below-elbow splint for 45 days, then active motion was encouraged. After 10 months, three patients had excellent results and one patient had good result using the criteria of Cooney et al (1987). Journal of Hand Surgery (British and European Volume, 1995) 20 B.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study aims to {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of trans-electric nerve stimulation (TENS) for phantom limb pain applied to contralateral limb (nonamputated limb). DESIGN: Two detailed single case studies using TENS on the contralateral limb are reported in a longitudinal study with one-year follow-up. Five variables were measured across this period. The study comprised of five sequential stages (Pre-assessment, Preliminary baseline, Start of intervention, Extended assessment, One-year follow-up). SETTING AND PATIENTS: Patients were identified at the Rookwood Hospital in Cardiff. They subsequently received regular home visits. The first patient was a 24 -year-old male who had suffered a left <b>below-elbow</b> <b>amputation</b> following a car crash. The second patient was a 38 -year-old male who had a transfemoral right amputation further to a viral infection. MEASURES: The following semistructured interview and questionnaires were used: McGill Comprehensive pain questionnaire part A and B; The Cambridge Phantom Limb Profile; The Groningen Questionnaire: Problems after Arm Amputation; and 13 Visual Analog Scales. CONCLUSIONS: Both patients showed a significant improvement in their perception of phantom limb pain and sensations that was maintained at one-year follow-up.

40|$|Background: The osseointegration {{programme}} for {{upper extremity}} amputation started in Sweden in 1990, when a titanium fixture was first implanted into a thumb. This method {{has since been}} used for transhumeral and <b>below-elbow</b> <b>amputation.</b> The treatment involves two surgical procedures. During the first a titanium fixture is surgically attached to the skeleton, and a second procedure six months later involves a skin penetrating abutment to which the prosthesis is attached. Objectives: To describe the osseointegration procedure for surgery, prosthetics and rehabilitation. Methods: Patients with short stumps and previous problems with prosthetic fitting were selected. From 1990 to April 2010, 37 upper limb cases were treated and fitted with prosthesis: 10 thumbs, 1 partial hand, 10 transradial and 16 transhumeral amputations. Of these, 7 patients are currently not prosthetic users. Results: Patients indicated that function {{and quality of life}} had improved since osseointegration. Conclusion: Osseointegration is an important platform for present and future prosthetic technology. The prosthetic situation is improved due to the stable fixation, freedom of motion and functionality. Clinical relevance The two-stage osseointegration procedure has the potential to change the rehabilitation strategy for selected upper limb amputees. The method eliminates the need for a socket and the prosthesis will always fit. The stable prosthetic fixation and increased freedom of motion generates improved function. Specially designed components and rehabilitation pro-cedures have been developed...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} the study was to assess the cases that were amputated in our clinic due to primary {{malignant}} and metastatic bone and soft tissue tumor. Material and Method: 24 cases that were amputated due to primary malignant and metastatic bone and soft tissue tumor between January 1987 and January 2012 were examined retrospectively. The cases were assessed in terms of age, gender, pathological diagnosis, localization, type of amputation, survival and characteristics. The data obtained were transferred to SPSS 15. 0 program and analyzed. Normality distributions of the data were analyzed with Shapiro-Wilk test. Results: Of the 24 cases, 17 (70 %) were men, while 7 (30 %) were women and the average age was 42 (between 12 and 68). The most common reasons for amputation were skin cancer (25 %), Ewing sarcoma (20. 8 %), Osteosarcoma (16. 6 %) and others (Malignant mesenchymal tumor, chondrosarcoma, synovial sarcoma, metastatic tumor). 16 of these patients had previously received an intervention in a different centre at least once. The most common type of amputation was above-knee amputation (58. 3 %), below-knee amputation (25 %) and others (hip disarticulation, <b>below-elbow</b> <b>amputation).</b> 8 patients were found to have skin problems and debridement was performed on 6. 14 cases died within the postoperative first year. Discussion: Amputation can be performed for the treatment of the patient’s other health problems and fast and local controls of advanced malignant extremity tumors...|$|E
