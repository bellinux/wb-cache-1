40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new algorithm for detection and compensation of <b>backlight</b> images. The proposed technique attacks {{the weakness of}} the conventional <b>backlight</b> image processing methods such as over-saturation, losing contrast and so on. The proposed algorithm consists of two operation phases: detection and compensation phases. In the detection phase, we use the spatial position characteristic and histogram of <b>backlight</b> image to obtain two image indices, which can determine the <b>backlight</b> degree of an image. Fuzzy logic is then used to integrate these two indices into a final <b>backlight</b> index deter-mining the final <b>backlight</b> degree of an image precisely. Second, in the compensation phase, to solve the over-saturation problem that exists usually in conventional image compensation methods, we propose the adaptive compensation-curve scheme to com-pensate and enhance the brightness of <b>backlight</b> images. The luminance of a <b>backlight</b> image is adjusted according to the compensation curve, which is adapted dynamically according to the <b>backlight</b> degree indicated by the <b>backlight</b> index estimated in the detection phase. The performance of the proposed technique is tested on 100 <b>backlight</b> images covering various kinds of <b>backlight</b> conditions and degrees. The experimental and comparison results clearly show the superiority of the proposed technique...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — For {{a typical}} {{portable}} handheld device, the <b>backlight</b> {{accounts for a}} significant percentage of the total energy consumption (e. g., around 30 % for a Compaq iPAQ 3650). Substantial energy savings can be achieved by dynamically adapting <b>backlight</b> intensity levels on such low-power portable devices. In this paper, we analyze the characteristics of video streaming services and propose an adaptive scheme called Quality Adapted <b>Backlight</b> Scaling (QABS), to achieve <b>backlight</b> energy savings for video playback applications on handheld devices. Specifically, we present a fast algorithm to optimize <b>backlight</b> dimming while keeping the degradation in image quality to a minimum so that the overall service quality is close to a specified threshold. Additionally, we propose two effective techniques to prevent frequent <b>backlight</b> switching, which negatively affects user perception of video. Our initial experimental results indicate that the energy used for <b>backlight</b> is significantly reduced, while the desired quality is satisfied. The proposed algorithms can be realized in real time. I...|$|R

25|$|The {{optical effect}} of a TN device in the voltage-on state is far less {{dependent}} on variations in the device thickness than that in the voltage-off state. Because of this, TN displays with low information content and no <b>backlighting</b> are usually operated between crossed polarizers such that they appear bright with no voltage (the eye is much more sensitive to variations in the dark state than the bright state). As most of 2010-era LCDs are used in television sets, monitors and smartphones, they have high-resolution matrix arrays of pixels to display arbitrary images using <b>backlighting</b> with a dark background. When no image is displayed, different arrangements are used. For this purpose, TN LCDs are operated between parallel polarizers, whereas IPS LCDs feature crossed polarizers. In many applications IPS LCDs have replaced TN LCDs, in particular in smartphones such as iPhones. Both the liquid crystal material and the alignment layer material contain ionic compounds. If an electric field of one particular polarity is applied {{for a long period}} of time, this ionic material is attracted to the surfaces and degrades the device performance. This is avoided either by applying an alternating current or by reversing the polarity of the electric field as the device is addressed (the response of the liquid crystal layer is identical, regardless of the polarity of the applied field).|$|E
