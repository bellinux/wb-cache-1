40|$|The {{extended}} mild slope equation was solved {{using the}} Gaussian elimination method with partial pivoting {{and a special}} <b>book-keeping</b> <b>procedure</b> for simulating water wave refraction, diffraction, shoaling, reflection, and resonance. This finite difference model only requires sufficient hard disk space to handle realistic applications using small computers. Three verification tests were selected to demonstrate the performance of this numerical model. Comparisons between the model results and available experimental or analytical results indicated a satisfactory agreement. Because of the finite difference method and the direct approach to solve the governing equation, this model is simple to maintain. More importantly, it will be easy to upgrade with other processes in the future, e. g., bottom friction, tidal current influence, and spectrum waves...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{describes}} the computation of various fluxes {{of energy and}} water balance components in the boundary layer over Delhi, for the years 1997 – 98 and 1998 – 99. Bulk-aerodynamic method {{has been used for}} the computation of sensible heat (H) and la-tent heat (LE) fluxes. Soil heat flux (G) has been directly measured using heat flux plate and also estimated using conductivity equation for comparison. <b>Book-keeping</b> <b>procedure</b> of Thornthwaite’s has been used for water balance evaluation. Potential evapotranspira-tion (PE) is computed using Thornthwaite’s method and compared with Penman’s for the representative station. The results of the computed fluxes of energy and water bal-ance components were compared with UREMBS- 94 (Urban Rural Energy and Moisture Balance Studies- ES/ 63 / 018 / 84 – 1994) results for both the winter and summer seasons for urban (dry) and rural (moist) areas. It was found that there persists an energy imbalance in both the seasons for urban/dry as well as rural/moist areas. However, urban areas showed positive (+V e) energy imbal-ances and act as heat/pollution sources, whereas the rural/moist areas showed negative (−V e) energy imbalances and act as heat/pollution sinks. These results are in good agreement with the UREMBS– 94 results. On the other hand, water balance analysis for urban/dry and rural/moist areas showed the same ranges of moisture indices indicating hardly any shift in climate. However, UREMBS– 94 results showed climatic shift in the urban regions...|$|E
40|$|Forestry {{has been}} {{monitored}} in agricultural profitability book-keeping {{as a separate}} business area since 1912 by the Economic Research of the MTT Agrifood Research Finland. At present, the monitoring {{is based on the}} accounting data collected annually from approximately 1050 book-keeping farms. The monitoring is grounded on the profitability book-keeping application, MARTTI, and an Internet based reporting system, EconomyDoctor. Since 1995, the Finnish data for the Farm Accountancy Data Network (FADN) of the member states of the European Union (EU) has also been supplied by MTT Economic Research, which is the authorized Finnish Agency in the FADN network. The book-keeping data collected from farms is used to calculate the closing of accounts, i. e. the profit and loss statement and balance sheet, as well as key economic ratios for each production line. Forestry incomes and expenditures are collected, as well as labour and property data. The key element of developments forest accounting is the availability of the forest inventory contained in the forest management plan (FMP) of a forest holding. Moreover, owners report all updates, such as fellings and silvicultural activities, after the forest inventory. Using the updated forest inventory, the MELA FMP software of the Finnish Forest Research Institute (Metla) provides the values of the growing stock and bare land and returns these to the MARTTI accounting system. These information systems have been integrated via the Internet using the XML protocol and service procedures, firewalls, etc. information and communication technologies (ICT). The established forestry <b>book-keeping</b> <b>procedure</b> provides reliable information for the purpose of financial statements. The financial statements have been drawn up using the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and especially its International Accounting Standards (IAS) 41 - Agriculture for the growing stock and IAS 16 - Property, Plant and Equipment for the bare land. The key IAS notion of fair value as the evaluation basis can, in the case of forestry be interpreted loosely as net present value (NPV). The fair value of the growing stock fluctuates annually according to the impact of the net increase and fellings. Both physical and price changes affect the net profit according to IAS 41. The key aspect of the development is the evaluation of the IAS fair value of the growing stock, classified as mature and immature biological assets, and their annual changes. The changes due to stumpage price and physical change in the growing stock are also to be disclosed separately. Moreover, the fair value of bare land is also estimated annually for each stand. The {{purpose of this study is}} to apply all relevant IAS/IFRS statutes and relevant theoretical contributions to determine whether the international accounting standards (IASs) are applicable in profitability book-keeping for forest holdings in order to support rural entrepreneurship. The structure of the financial statement reports accords to the IAS standards. The applicability of the IAS standards have been tested with the data and technical framework of the profitability book-keeping system of the MTT Economic Research. vo...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{operation of}} the accounting staff in a corporate management envi-ronment of a free-market enterprise {{is determined by the}} accountants’ job skills, i. e. not just their knowledge of <b>book-keeping</b> regulations and <b>procedures,</b> but rather, in their problem-solving ability, effective decision-making with regard to production, finance and investment, as well as the drive to make an impact on the development strategy of enter-prises in a competitive environment and the readiness to provide information for different groups of users. This paper discusses the core competencies of accounting officers and studies what makes accounting practices effective. The findings presented in this paper will be used to substantiate the competence-based approach to the method of providing accounting officers with the type of skills and abilities which are essential to the smooth operation of an accounting department. ...|$|R
