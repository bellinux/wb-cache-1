Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E
25|$|Precoding is multi-stream <b>beamforming,</b> in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) <b>beamforming,</b> the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of <b>beamforming</b> are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In line-of-sight propagation, <b>beamforming</b> results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by multipath propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit <b>beamforming</b> cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas, and precoding with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that precoding requires knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E

An environment chamber was built and other precautions were taken to protect the sensitive condenser microphones from rain, thunderstorms and other environmental elements during prolonged stay in the outdoor test stand. A camera mounted {{at the center of}} the array was used to photograph the plume. In the first phase of the study the array was placed in an anechoic chamber for calibration, and validation of the indigenous Matlab(R) based <b>beamform</b> software. It was found that the "advanced" <b>beamform</b> methods, such as CLEAN-SC was partially successful in identifying speaker sources placed closer than the Rayleigh criteria. To participate in the field test all equipments were shipped to NASA Marshal Space Flight Center, where the elements of the array hardware were rebuilt around the test stand. The sensitive amplifiers and the data acquisition hardware were placed in a safe basement, and 100 m long cables were used to connect the microphones, Kulites and the camera. The array chamber and the microphones were found to withstand the environmental elements as well as the shaking from the rocket plume generated noise. The <b>beamform</b> map was superimposed on a photo of the rocket plume to readily identify the source distribution. It was found that the plume made an exceptionally long, > 30 diameter, noise source over a large frequency range. The shock pattern created spatial modulation of the noise source. Interestingly, the concrete pad of the horizontal test stand was found to be a good acoustic reflector: the <b>beamform</b> map showed two distinct source distributions- the plume and its reflection on the pad. The array was found to be most effective in the frequency range of 2 kHz to 10 kHz. As expected, the classical <b>beamform</b> method excessively smeared the noise sources at lower frequencies and produced excessive side-lobes at higher frequencies. The "advanced" <b>beamform</b> routine CLEAN-SC created a series of lumped sources which may be unphysical.

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, new pre- and {{post-processing}} schemes {{are developed}} to process shallow-water sonar data {{to improve the}} accuracy of target detection. A multichannel subband adaptive filtering is applied to preprocess the data in order to isolate the potential target returns from the acoustic backscattered signals and improve the signal-to-reverberation ratio. This is done by estimating the time delays associated with the reflections in different subbands. The preprocessed results are then <b>beamformed</b> to generate an image for each ping of the sonar. The testing results on both the simulated and real data revealed the efficiency of this scheme in time-delay estimation and its capability in removing most of the competing reverberations and noise. To improve detection rate while significantly minimizing the incident of false detections, a high-order correlation (HOC) method for postprocessing the <b>beamformed</b> images is then developed. This method determines the consistency in occurrence of the target returns in several consecutive pings. The application of the HOC process to the real <b>beamformed</b> sonar data showed the ability of this method for removing the clutter {{and at the same}} time boosting the target returns in several consecutive pings. The algorithm is simple, fast, and easy to implement. Index Terms—Adaptive filtering, high-order correlation, sonar, target detection, wavelet transform. I...|$|R
25|$|Diversity coding {{techniques}} are used {{when there is}} no channel knowledge at the transmitter. In diversity methods, a single stream (unlike multiple streams in spatial multiplexing) is transmitted, but the signal is coded using techniques called space-time coding. The signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with full or near orthogonal coding. Diversity coding exploits the independent fading in the multiple antenna links to enhance signal diversity. Because there is no channel knowledge, there is no <b>beamforming</b> or array gain from diversity coding.|$|E
25|$|Understanding {{the channel}} allows for {{manipulation}} of the phase and amplitude of each transmitter in order to form a beam. To correctly form a beam, the transmitter needs to understand {{the characteristics of the}} channel. This process is called channel sounding or channel estimation. A known signal is sent to the mobile device that enables it to build a picture of the channel environment. The mobile device sends back the channel characteristics to the transmitter. The transmitter can then apply the correct phase and amplitude adjustments to form a beam directed at the mobile device. This is called a closed-loop MIMO system. For <b>beamforming,</b> it is required to adjust the phases and amplitude of each transmitter. In a beamformer optimized for spatial diversity or spatial multiplexing, each antenna element simultaneously transmits a weighted combination of two data symbols.|$|E
25|$|Massive MIMO is a {{technology}} where {{the number of}} terminals is {{much less than the}} number of base station (mobile station) antennas. In a rich scattering environment, the full advantages of the massive MIMO system can be exploited using simple <b>beamforming</b> strategies such as maximum ratio transmission (MRT), maximum ratio-combining (MRC) or zero forcing (ZF). To achieve these benefits of massive MIMO, accurate CSI must be available perfectly. However, in practice, the channel between the transmitter and receiver is estimated from orthogonal pilot sequences which are limited by the coherence time of the channel. Most importantly, in a multicell setup, the reuse of pilot sequences of several co-channel cells will create pilot contamination. When there is pilot contamination, the performance of massive MIMO degrades quite drastically. To alleviate the effect of pilot contamination, the work of proposes a simple pilot assignment and channel estimation method from limited training sequences.|$|E

40|$|Appraisal of {{the noise}} {{produced}} at the combustion stage in a jet engine is becoming more important, as fan and jet noise have been significantly reduced over many years. Therefore, combustion noise is contributing more to overall noise, especially at low jet velocities. Environmental regulations stipulate that gas emissions from a jet engine should be reduced. Thus, new techniques have been introduced in their operation, especially concerning the combustion process. Accordingly, {{there is a need}} for improved processing methods in order to extract combustion noise from other sources in new build engines. A novel processing technique to extract turbofan engine combustion noise called 3 S-Array is presented. It has been developed using a multiple coherence technique with data acquired in the in-duct and external sound fields of a jet engine. In-duct sensors are located in the combustion chamber and in the nozzle of the engine, and external data is acquired using an array of microphones. A <b>beamformed</b> signal focused on the nozzle of the engine is generated with the data from the external array. Jet noise and in influences of the room on the array output are reduced using this focusing technique, which is referred to as Focused <b>Beamformed</b> Output (FBO).

40|$|Abstract. In prior work, we {{developed}} a speaker tracking system based on an extended Kalman filter using time delays of arrival (TDOAs) as acoustic features. While this system functioned well, its utility was lim-ited to scenarios in which a single speaker was to be tracked. In this work, we remove this restriction by generalizing the IEKF, first to a probabilistic data association filter, which incorporates a clutter model for rejection of spurious acoustic events, {{and then to a}} joint probabilistic data association filter (JPDAF), which maintains a separate state vector for each active speaker. In a set of experiments conducted on seminar and meeting data, the JPDAF speaker tracking system reduced the multiple object tracking errror from 20. 7 % to 14. 3 % with respect to the IEKF system. In a set of automatic speech recognition experiments conducted on the output of a 64 channel microphone array which was <b>beamformed</b> using automatic speaker position estimates, applying the JPDAF track-ing system reduced word error rate from 67. 3 % to 66. 0 %.

40|$|Collaborative {{localization}} {{and discrimination}} of multiple acoustic sources {{is an important}} problem in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs). Localization approaches can be categorized as signal-based and feature-based methods. The signal-based methods are not suitable for collaborative localization in WSNs because they require transmission of raw acoustic data. In feature-based methods, signal features are extracted at each sensor and the localization is done by multisensor fusion of the extracted features. Such methods are suitable for WSNs due to their lower bandwidth requirements. In this paper, we present a feature-based localization and discrimination approach for multiple harmonic acoustic sources in WSNs. The approach uses acoustic <b>beamform</b> and Power Spectral Density (PSD) data from each sensor as the features for multisensor fusion, localization, and discrimination. We use a graphical model to formulate the problem, and employ maximum likelihood and Bayesian estimation for estimating {{the position of the}} sources as well as their fundamental and dominant harmonic frequencies.

40|$|Recently, {{there have}} been reports of six bright, {{dispersed}} bursts of coherent radio emission found in pulsar surveys with the Parkes Multibeam Receiver. Not much is known about the progenitors of these bursts, but they are highly energetic, and probably of extragalactic origin. Their properties suggest extreme environments and interesting physics, but in order to understand and study these events, more examples need to be found. Fortunately, the recent boom in radio astronomy means many 'next-generation' radio telescopes are set to begin observing in the near future. In this paper we discuss the prospects of detecting short extragalactic bursts, in both <b>beamformed</b> and imaging data, using these instruments. We find that often the volume of space probed by radio surveys of fast transients is limited by the dispersion measure of the source, rather than its physical distance (although the two quantities are related). This effect is larger for low-frequency telescopes, where propagation effects are more prominent, but their larger fields-of-view are often enough to compensate for this. Our simulations suggest that the low-frequency component of Square Kilometre Array Phase 1 could find an extragalactic burst every hour. We also show that if the sensitivity of the telescope is above a certain threshold, imaging surveysmay prove more fruitful than <b>beamformed</b> surveys in finding these sorts of transients...|$|R
