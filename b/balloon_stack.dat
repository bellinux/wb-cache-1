50|$|After the war ended, the General was {{repaired}} {{and continued}} {{service on the}} Western and Atlantic. In the 1870s, the General was completely rebuilt, it had received a new pilot, boiler, and other components. Most notably, its three dome configuration was reduced to two domes, and its Radley-Hunter style <b>balloon</b> <b>stack</b> was replaced with a diamond stack, as the engine had been converted to burn coal. Indeed, the rebuilt engine had little resemblance to its original form.|$|E
50|$|The first {{portion of}} the {{railroad}} connecting Chicago to Joliet was completed by October, 1952 and on October 10, 1852, an American-type locomotive (4-4-0) called the Rocket, was coupled to six newly built yellow coaches. At ten {{o'clock in the morning}} the Rocket belched a cloud of wood smoke from its <b>balloon</b> <b>stack</b> and headed west over the 58-pound iron rails that had been imported from England. The trip took two hours and the train was cheered by thousands along the way. It had to make the return trip as a back-up movement because there was yet no turning facilities at Joliet.|$|E
5000|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was built}} in 1964 for the Six Gun Territory Amusement park in Silver Springs, Florida, who had given it the number 7, and the name [...] "Robert E. Lee". The park had closed in the early 1980s and the engine was sold to the Jefferson Railway in 1985, though the engine retains both the name and number originally given. Her <b>balloon</b> <b>stack</b> suggests a wood-burner, but the wood on the tender is strictly ornamental, as she has been converted to burn propane. (The use of feminine pronouns when referring to locomotives carried over from ships).|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Dolly Parton {{became part}} owner of the property, and the park was renamed Dollywood. The ride, {{to go with the}} new name, was renamed Dollywood Express. After the 2004 {{operating}} season, the park removed the <b>balloon</b> <b>stacks,</b> which were proving to be unpopular, and gave the locomotives a new coat of paint. Since the removal of the <b>balloon</b> <b>stacks,</b> the locomotive's paint schemes have been constantly changing.|$|R
50|$|In 1976, Jack and Pete Herschend bought Gold Rush Junction, {{renaming}} it Silver Dollar City Tennessee, {{making it}} a sister park to its Branson, Missouri attraction Silver Dollar City. The ride was renamed again. This time, instead of a minor text change, #192 was given a complete new look. She was painted black instead of Tweetsie green. She was also fitted with <b>balloon</b> <b>stacks</b> {{to give her a}} more western look. In 1977, the ride acquired two new locomotives from the WP&YR, #70 and #71.|$|R
5000|$|Balloon DecoratingBalloons {{are used}} for decorating {{birthday}} parties, weddings, corporate functions, school events, and for other festive gatherings. The artists who use the round balloons to build are called [...] "stackers" [...] and the artists who use pencil balloons to build are called [...] "twisters." [...] Most commonly associated with helium balloon decor, more recently balloon decorators have been moving towards the creation of air-filled balloon decorations due to the non-renewable natural resource of helium limited in supply. The most common types of balloon decor include arches, columns, centerpieces, balloon drops, sculptures, and balloon bouquets. With the increased aptitude for balloon twisting as well as <b>balloon</b> <b>stacking,</b> {{the rise of the}} deco-twister manifests itself as the combination of stacking techniques as well as twisting techniques to create unique and interesting balloon decor option. Party balloons are mostly made of a natural latex tapped from rubber trees, and can be filled with air, helium, water, or any other suitable liquid or gas. The rubber's elasticity makes the volume adjustable.|$|R
5000|$|The #12 engine, {{also known}} as the [...] "Kenny Van Meter", {{features}} a propane-fired boiler and has a total weight of 25 tons (engine and tender). It is a 2/3 scale replica of The General. It is painted blue. The locomotive's original name was Tecumseh after the Shawnee leader. Originally, it featured a balloon-style stack but it was replaced in the late 1980s or early 1990s to make it stand apart from the green engine. The blue engine also originally had two blue domes but were painted red to match the wheels in the late 1980s or early 1990s, when the <b>balloon</b> <b>stack</b> was removed.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was originally}} a wood-burner with a tender that held just two cords of wood. Often the tenders wood was used before the train could reach a wood pile, forcing {{the crew to}} make use of the wooden right-of-way fences to keep the train moving. Later the locomotive was converted into a coal-burner. As built, the engine had a straight boiler (not tapered from a larger diameter at the firebox end to a smaller diameter at the smokebox end), had the <b>balloon</b> <b>stack</b> typical of wood burning engines, and three domes—the center of which was for sanding the rails to improve traction when needed. As the engine aged and parts replaced, the engines appearance changed. The engine received a diamond stack for burning coal, its boiler replaced with a tapered design, and was reduced to a two dome configuration.|$|E
50|$|The General was {{retired from}} service in 1891 and stored on a siding in Vinings, GA where it awaited its final fate. Early the next year, E. Warren Clark, a {{professional}} photographer, discovered the engine in Vinings, and approached John W. Thomas, {{president of the}} Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway (which had won the lease on the Western and Atlantic Railroad of the State of Georgia in 1890), with the proposal of restoring the General for exhibition at the upcoming World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Thomas approved of the idea, and the General was soon taken to the NC&StL Ry Shops at West Nashville to be restored. At this time, the engine was given a Radley-Hunter style <b>balloon</b> <b>stack</b> similar to the engine's original, and was reverted to a wood burner. The engine had been restored by 1892, {{a year before the}} exposition. During this time, the engine traveled to Chattanooga to attend a reunion of the Army of the Cumberland veterans. This trip made apparent the difficulties associated with wood burning, so the engine was returned to a coal burner {{by the end of the}} year. The engine was given a unique new stack at this time, one that, while designed for coal burning, was styled like the original so as to give the appearance of a wood burner.|$|E
40|$|This article details {{steps in}} {{creating}} low-power artificial muscles using 3 D printing. It describes a manufacturing {{system that can}} be used to fabricate seamless tubular dielectric elastomer actuators (DEA), for eventual use in biorobotic devices. The focus is on producing passive elastomeric components of DEA and the dimensional changes that occur after printing is complete. A four-axis printing system is described, capable of spray depositing multilayer tubular silicone membranes onto an air-permeable mandrel. Mechanical strain was imparted in the membranes by means of inflation. A laser measurement system was constructed to act as a 3 D scanner, which measured the shape of the inflated ‘‘balloon. ’’ The surface shape was reconstructed in software using the parametric modeling tool Grasshopper. Seamless auxetic tessellations were calculated across the entire surface, and then converted to CNC GCode. These toolpaths were then physically extruded over the surface of the <b>balloon,</b> <b>stacked</b> five layers high. When the extruded silicone structure was completely cured, the pneumatic strain was released, allowing the structure to collapse evenly. The compression in the printed structure was balanced by the tension in the stretched membranes, thus producing a minimum energy structure...|$|R

50|$|American {{historic}} carpentry is {{the historic}} methods with which wooden buildings {{were built in}} what is now the United States since European settlement. A number of methods were used to form the wooden walls and the types of structural carpentry are often defined by the wall, floor, and roof construction such as log, timber framed, <b>balloon</b> framed, or <b>stacked</b> plank. Some types of historic houses are called plank houses but plank house has several meanings which are discussed below. Roofs were almost always framed with wood, sometimes with timber roof trusses. Stone and brick buildings also have some wood framing for floors, interior walls and roofs.|$|R
5000|$|The engine {{has been}} {{restored}} to its 1880s appearance, {{as opposed to the}} wartime appearance it had from the 1936 restoration. As such, it has received a new diamond stack similar to the one it had when retired, as well as a new cowcatcher with vertical wooden slats (similar to that currently worn by the General), a black paint scheme, and was returned to its 1870s number, 12, though retains the Texas name, with a newly fabricated number plate to reflect the number. The old <b>balloon</b> <b>stack,</b> cowcatcher, and other removed elements from the 1936 restoration will remain in the history centers collection, and may be exhibited separately. [...] The engines new look caused a controversy, with critics saying the Texass new look erased its Civil War history. Commenting on the engines new appearance, Gordon Jones, of the Atlanta History museum, noted that the Texas was in service for fifty years, the Great Locomotive Chase occupying but a few hours of its service life, and said [...] "We’ve already got one locomotive General telling the story of the Great Locomotive Chase. We can utilize the Texas to tell a different story.” The fully restored Texas was publicly unveiled by the North Carolina Transportation Museum on April 28, 2017, during a weekend long celebration in which it was exhibited alongside other engines at the museum, including the visiting Lehigh Valley No. 126 and the Norfolk and Western Railway no. 611, another engine restored at the museum.|$|E
5000|$|In 1868 a fire {{partially}} {{destroyed the}} William Crooks. Albion B. Smith was tasked with restoring the locomotive {{and became the}} locomotives engineer once it returned to service. He became a personal friend to James J. Hill through his works and service with the William Crooks. The old locomotive had served almost 50 years and had eventually been assigned to runs in Montana and Washington. The William Crooks was in passenger service until September 30, 1897, after which it was retired, and {{by the turn of}} the century was sitting decommissioned in a corner of the Great Northern yard in St. Paul. [...] The locomotive was restored to operation for Hills 70th birthday in 1908, as he had insisted when informed of its condition. Smith, who worked a regular schedule for the Great Northern Railway, would be reassigned to duty with the William Crooks for special events such as this and, later, the Alaska-Yukon-Pacific Exposition. [...] After he received word that the William Crooks was to be scrapped, it was Smith who spoke to Hill about it, with Hill declaring, [...] "Not as long as I live". [...] After Hills death in 1916, the Great Northern continued to exhibit the train at special events. [...] The railroad gave the engine a <b>balloon</b> <b>stack</b> similar in appearance to its original, but internally designed to be suitable for coal as well as wood. In 1924 the locomotive went on an exhibition tour from Chicago to Seattle. [...] For this event, the railroad rebuilt the engine to further resemble its original form, restoring it to the original three-dome configuration, though it retained the tapered boiler. The William Crooks was displayed at the Baltimore and Ohio Railroads [...] "Fair of the Iron Horse" [...] in 1927, then at the 1939 New York Worlds Fair, and finally at the Chicago Railroad Fair in 1948 as part of the [...] "Wheels A-Rolling" [...] pageant, traveling to and from all three events under its own power. Though the locomotive had been converted from burning wood to burning coal as fuel, its headlight remained lit by kerosene; this restricted the William Crooks travel to daylight hours only.|$|E
