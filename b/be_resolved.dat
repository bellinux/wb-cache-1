5|$|Self-harm is not {{typically}} suicidal behaviour, {{although there is}} the possibility that a self-inflicted injury may result in life-threatening damage. Although the person may not recognise the connection, self-harm often becomes a response to profound and overwhelming emotional pain that cannot <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> in a more functional way.|$|E
5|$|The States may, if they wish, permit {{abortion}} on demand, but the Constitution {{does not require}} them to do so. The permissibility of abortion, and the limitations upon it, are to <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> like most important questions in our democracy: by citizens trying to persuade one another and then voting.|$|E
50|$|The Hero System uses Champions {{key system}} features. Tasks <b>are</b> <b>resolved</b> using three six-sided dice and power effects (especially damage) <b>are</b> <b>resolved</b> by rolling {{a number of}} dice based on the powers strength.|$|R
50|$|XRIs <b>are</b> <b>resolved</b> to XRDS {{documents}} {{using the}} HTTP(S) protocol {{in the same}} way as URLs <b>are</b> <b>resolved</b> to resource records using the DNS protocol. This lookup process can be configured by passing parameters.|$|R
50|$|Turns are alternate. In {{their turn}} a player dices for Player Initiative Points (PIPs), spell casting and {{shooting}} <b>is</b> <b>resolved</b> and finally close combat <b>is</b> <b>resolved.</b> A player's PIPs {{are used to}} move elements, cast spells and perform certain other actions. Shooting, spell casting and close combat <b>is</b> <b>resolved</b> using the same mechanisms; shooting and spell casting <b>are</b> <b>resolved</b> between any elements in range, close combat between adjacent elements. Combat results generally cause elements to recoil, flee or be destroyed outright. An army loses if its general is lost, half its points are lost or, if the defender, its stronghold is lost. A game generally lasts less than an hour.|$|R
5|$|Both sides cite strong evidence, and the {{conflict}} {{has yet to}} <b>be</b> <b>resolved.</b> The shell of testudines distinguishes them from other vertebrates. The shell is not an exoskeleton, but a modified ribcage {{and part of the}} vertebral column. Because of the shell, the pectoral and pelvic girdles are located within the ribcage. The limb bones are also modified to accommodate to the shell.|$|E
5|$|Brennan then {{noted that}} the {{principles}} of statutory construction as regards to Indians were very specific. Any differences in possible interpretation must <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> {{in favor of the}} tribe or the Indian. Since Minnesota's interpretation did not meet any of these tests regarding either the consent of Congress to tax or of statutory construction, Brennan stated that the Supreme Court would not follow the state's reasoning, and reversed the lower court's decision.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the Dubna team {{carried out}} {{chemical}} experiments on element 102 {{and concluded that}} it behaved as the heavier homologue of ytterbium. The Russian scientists proposed the name joliotium (Jo) for the new element after Irène Joliot-Curie, who had recently died, creating an element naming controversy that would not <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> for several decades, which each group using its own proposed names.|$|E
50|$|In post-Proto-Greek times, the {{resulting}} palatal consonants and clusters <b>were</b> <b>resolved</b> in varying ways. Most notably, *ň and *ř <b>were</b> <b>resolved</b> into plain sonorants plus a palatal on-glide, which eventually turned the preceding vowel into a diphthong.|$|R

5|$|In a {{book titled}} Militarism U.S.A. (1970), Shoup and Donovan {{elaborated}} their criticisms. Shoup said the country was seeking military solutions to issues that could <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> politically. He accused military leaders of propagating the war for their own career advancement, and accused the veterans group Veterans of Foreign Wars of propagandizing for the armed forces establishment. Shoup blamed the American education system for {{what he saw as}} discouraging independent thought and stressing obedience.|$|E
5|$|In addition, isotopic {{analysis}} of exposed terrestrial rocks has demonstrated the cosmogenic (cosmic ray) production of 21Ne. This isotope {{is generated by}} spallation reactions on magnesium, sodium, silicon, and aluminium. By analyzing all three isotopes, the cosmogenic component can <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> from magmatic neon and nucleogenic neon. This suggests that neon will be a useful tool in determining cosmic exposure ages of surface rocks and meteorites.|$|E
5|$|Japanese website ITmedia {{reviewed}} the beta version in September 2004. The reviewer enjoyed the experience overall and found communication with other players easy, but {{found a few}} faults with the game that they hoped would <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> later, and generally found the female characters less effective in battle. During its first day of operation, the game registered 200,000 users, making it the best-selling mobile game up until that time, and was accessed 1.6 million times. According to Ito, by 2006, the game was still highly popular in Japan.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{classification}} of static polymorphism {{in which a}} function call <b>is</b> <b>resolved</b> using the ''''best match technique'''', i.e. the function <b>is</b> <b>resolved</b> depending upon the argument list. Method overloading is usually associated with statically-typed programming languages that enforce type checking in function calls. When overloading a method, you are really just making {{a number of different}} methods that happen to have the same name.

5|$|Later in 1883, Steinitz took {{second place}} in the {{extremely}} strong London 1883 chess tournament behind Zukertort, who made a brilliant start, faded at the end but finished 3 points ahead. Steinitz finished 2½ points ahead of the third-placed competitor, Blackburne. Zukertort's victory again led some commentators to suggest that Zukertort should be regarded as the world chess champion, while others said the issue could only <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> by a match between Steinitz and Zukertort.|$|E
5|$|No {{historical}} attestation of Sheshi {{is known}} for certain. Sheshi is absent from the Turin canon, a list of kings written on papyrus during the Ramesside period and which serves as the primary historical source for the second intermediate period. This is because {{the section of the}} papyrus covering the 13th to 17th Dynasties is heavily damaged and the problem of Seshi's chronological position cannot <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> from the document.|$|E
5|$|Scientists at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory {{think that}} Voyager 1 entered the {{termination}} shock in February 2003. This marks {{the point where}} the solar wind slows down to subsonic speeds. Some other scientists expressed doubt, discussed in the journal Nature of November 6, 2003. The issue would not <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> until other data became available, since Voyager 1s solar-wind detector ceased functioning in 1990. This failure meant that termination shock detection would have to be inferred from the data from the other instruments on board.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed {{to the site of the}} reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} team {{followed up}} their initial identification of Eris with spectroscopic observations {{made at the}} 8m Gemini North Telescope in Hawaii on January 25, 2005. Infrared light from the object revealed the presence of methane ice, indicating that the surface may be {{similar to that of}} Pluto, which at the time was the only TNO known to have surface methane, and of Neptune's moon Triton, which also has methane on its surface. No surface details can <b>be</b> <b>resolved</b> from Earth or its orbit with any instrument currently available.|$|E
