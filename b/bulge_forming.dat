50|$|A {{circular}} sheet (blank) of 118 mm diameter was {{cut from}} the alloy sheet and the cut surfaces polished to remove burrs. The blank {{was placed on the}} die and the top chamber brought in contact. The furnace was switched on to the set temperature. Once the set temperature was reached the top chamber was brought down further to effect the required blank holder pressure. About 10 minutes were allowed for thermal equilibration. The argon gas cylinder was opened to the set pressure gradually. Simultaneously, the linear variable differential transformer (LVDT), fitted {{at the bottom of the}} die, was set for recording the sheet bulge. Once the LVDT reached 45 mm (radius of bottom die), gas pressure was stopped and the furnace switched off. The formed components were taken out when the temperature of the die set had dropped to 600 °C. Easy removal of the component was possible at this stage. Superplastic <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> of hemispheres were carried out at temperatures of 1098, 1123, 1148, 1173, 1198 and 1223 K (825, 850, 875, 900, 925 and 950 °C) at forming pressures of 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 and 0.87 MPa. As the <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> process progresses, significant thinning in the sheet material becomes obvious. An ultrasonic technique was used to measure the thickness distribution on the profile of the formed component. The components were analyzed in terms of the thickness distribution, thickness strain and thinning factor.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} three qualitatively {{different}} scenarios for bulge formation: a secular evolution {{model in which}} <b>bulges</b> <b>form</b> after disks and undergo several central starbursts, a primordial collapse model in which <b>bulges</b> and disks <b>form</b> simultaneously, and an early bulge formation model in which <b>bulges</b> <b>form</b> prior to disks.

40|$|<b>Bulge</b> <b>forming</b> is a {{manufacturing}} {{process that is}} becoming increasingly important as a technology {{that can be used}} to produce seamless, lightweight and near-net-shape industrial components. The process is being increasingly applied in the automotive and aerospace industries where the demands for increased structural strength and decreased vehicle weight make it a very attractive manufacturing method. This work is concerned with increasing knowledge of the deformation mechanisms during <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> processes using numerical simulation. A number of complex <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> operations which have not been satisfactorily analysed in published research were identified and subsequently analysed using commercial finite element software. A non-linear explicit solution method was used in each case. The processes chosen for simulation were: hydraulic <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> of cross joints, <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> using a solid bulging medium, <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> of bimetallic tubes and the behaviour of the die during these <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> processes. In each case a number of process parameters were varied and their effect on the process identified. Where possible the finite element results were validated against results from experimental trials. It was found that the simulations predicted the experimental results with accuracy, thus indicating that the models developed here can be used with confidence to predict the behaviour of <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> operations. From the results of the finite element simulations it was concluded that when designing processes to bulge form cross joint components that compressive axial loading should be used in conjunction with pressure loading where possible, friction between the die and workpiece should be kept to a minimum where maximum branch height is required and greater tube thickness should be used when seeking to reduce stress and thinning behaviour in the formed component. The results also indicate that, where possible a solid bulging medium should be used as it results in much more favorable forming conditions, which can allow the realisation of greater branch heights. The simulations of <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> of bimetallic tubes showed that the relative thickness of the two metal layers has a significant effect on the shape of the final component. It was also found that varying the relative strength of the two metallic layers had a significant effect on the branch height obtained. The development of stress in the die during various <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> process was detailed at various stages during the process. It was found that generally a stress concentration moves towards the die bend as the process progresses. The effect of using different die materials was examined and it was concluded that certain materials are unsuitable for use as die materials due to the fact that their yield stress is exceeded during the forming process...|$|E

40|$|AbstractRecent {{theoretical}} {{assessments of}} metal/polymer bilayers indicate a potentially significant {{delay in the}} onset of ductile failure modes, especially under dynamic loading, due to strain hardening of the polymer. The response of copper/polyurethane bilayers under dynamic and quasi-static loadings is investigated via static tensile, static <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> and dynamic <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> tests. Two polyurethanes PU 1 and PU 2 were chosen with a significant contrast in stiffness and ductility: PU 1 has a glass transition temperature Tg close to − 56 °C and at room temperature it has a low modulus, low strength and a high tensile failure strain. In contrast, PU 2 has a Tg of 49 °C and at room temperature it has a high modulus and strength but a much smaller tensile failure strain. In most of the tests, the polymer coatings were approximately twice {{the thickness of the}} metal layer. Under static loadings (tensile and <b>bulge</b> <b>forming)</b> the PU 2 bilayer outperformed the uncoated metal plate of equal mass while the PU 1 bilayer had a performance inferior to the equivalent uncoated plate. We attribute this {{to the fact that the}} PU 2 retards the necking of the copper layer and thus increases its energy absorption capacity while the PU 1 coating provides no such synergistic effect. The dynamic <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> tests indicate that on an equal mass basis, the dynamic performance of the PU 2 bilayers with a weakly bonded polymer coating were comparable to the uncoated plates but intriguingly, when the PU 2 was strongly adhered to the copper plates the performance of these bilayers was inferior to that of the uncoated plates. Thus, the coatings do not provide dynamic performance benefits on an equal mass basis. However, it is shown that increasing the mass of a plate by adding a polyurethane layer can improve the performance for a given total blast impulse. Given the ease of applying polyurethane coatings they may provide a practical solution to enhancing the blast resistance of existing metallic structures...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{and application of}} finite element methods {{in the area of}} material processing has increased rapidly in recent years. Application of FEM is reported in the processing of most engineering materials including new materials like metal matrix composites. In metal forming, FEM is mostly applied to conventional forming situations like forging and upsetting, extrusion, drawing, rolling, sheet metal forming, casting and moulding and machining Most of these forming operations are also well analysed by theories of plastic deformation like limit theorems, slip-line field theory etc. In contrast, new and unconventional metal forming cases, which are often very complex, are relatively under-analysed either by the theoretical methods mentioned above or by numerical methods like finite element. This work is mainly devoted to computer simulation and study of one of the unconventional metal forming process called <b>bulge</b> <b>forming.</b> There are various type of industrial products made by <b>bulge</b> <b>forming</b> process. In some processes the main forming load is the hydrostaic pressure {{on the surface of the}} blank plate or shell. While in others, an in-plane compressive load is also applied simultaneously with the pressure load.

These simulations include explicit treatment of metal-line cooling in addition to dust and self-shielding, H_ 2 based star formation. The 4 simulated halos have masses ranging from a few times 10 ^ 10 to nearly 10 ^ 12 solar masses. Using a kinematic decomposition of these galaxies into present-day bulge and disk components, we find that the typical pressure of the star-forming ISM in the present-day bulge is higher than that in the present-day disk by an order of magnitude. We also find that pressure of the star-forming ISM at high redshift is on average, higher than ISM pressures at low redshift. This explains the why the <b>bulge</b> <b>forms</b> at higher pressures: the disk assembles at lower redshift, when the ISM is lower pressure and the <b>bulge</b> <b>forms</b> at high redshift, when the ISM is at higher pressure.
