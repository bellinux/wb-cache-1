40|$|This paper {{describes}} a Monte Carlo {{study of the}} thermal conductivity and impurity transport in a tokamak with an optimized <b>bundle</b> <b>divertor</b> configuration. This configuration {{has been designed to}} obtain the best plasma performance. When collisions and electric fields are included, the thermal conductivity was found to be 40 % larger than that of an axisymmetric neoclassical value. Without a divertor the oxygen impurity was found to diffuse toward's the center of the plasma as predicted theoretically. However, this impurity diffused outwardly when the divertor was turned on. Few impurity particles diffused into the plasma when launched in the scrape-off layer. This optimized <b>bundle</b> <b>divertor</b> meets the engineering constraints of a power producing reactor. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{high-order}} {{dependence of}} toroidal ripple from a <b>bundle</b> <b>divertor</b> on the magnet shield thickness increases {{the desirability of}} a magnet technology with minimal shielding requirements. A jacketed conductor with MgO powder insulation has been used successfully in highly irradiated environments. Its properties and limitations are described. A thermal and electrical sizing code has been developed for magnet design with this technology. Two design examples for ETF and FED missions show reduced recirculating power from previously reported designs. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{some general}} aspects of MARFE formation and bifurcation of temperature in stellarators. The {{starting point is}} the three-dimensional heat conduction equation with a conduction matrix depending on temperature and position. The existence, uniqueness and stability of steady state solutions are discussed. Marfes in stellarators predominantly exist on rational magnetic surfaces if the shear is low. Outside the last magnetic surface bifurcation of temperature can arise on flux <b>bundles</b> between two <b>divertor</b> target plates. The number of solutions depends on the non-linearity of the boundary conditions and {{the details of the}} radiation function, especially its dependence on the temperature. Numerical solutions of the one-dimensional heat conduction equation in a slab and a cylindrical fusion plasma, using the shooting method, illustrate the various aspects of bifurcation. (orig.)
