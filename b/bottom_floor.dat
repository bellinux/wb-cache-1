5|$|The player picks one of {{the three}} {{brothers}} to play as; Pixie can also be unlocked as a playable character. They traverse six areas within a time limit to make it back to the fairy world in time. The areas all consist of a number of floors; the player needs to collect all keys on each floor, before being allowed to jump down to a lower floor. To find the keys, the player uses a radar that displays their locations; once all have been collected, it shows the location of the exit. Once the player reaches the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor,</b> they are faced with a boss character they need to defeat, after which they can proceed to the next area.|$|E
5|$|The {{tower was}} terraced {{into the side}} of a mound, so the {{northern}} side of the basement is partially below ground level. As was typical of most keeps, the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{a two-year}} project {{to rebuild the}} {{property}} above the shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, {{carried out by the}} architects Maguire & Co., the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students. The new JCR, about twice the size of the previous one, can be partitioned into smaller rooms or kept open for large meetings; there is also a kitchen, a student committee room and a glazed conservatory extending onto the adjoining terrace. Above the JCR are three floors of new student rooms. The two rooms of the old JCR, each of which contain war memorials, have been converted into seminar and meeting rooms, and are now known as the Harold Wilson Room and the Memorial Room.|$|E

5|$|The Old Members' Building, which {{contains}} a music room, 24 study-bedrooms and some lecture rooms, was built between 1969 and 1971. It was built after a fundraising appeal to Old Members {{to mark the}} college's quatercentenary, and was opened by the Prince of Wales in 1971. The Fellows' Garden is between the Old Members' Building and {{the rear of the}} rooms {{on the west side of}} the second quadrangle. In 2002, a two-year project to rebuild the property above the college-owned shops on Ship Street was completed. As part of the work, the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> was converted from rooms occupied by students and fellows into a new Junior Common Room (JCR), to replace the common room in the second quadrangle, which was by then too small to cope with the increased numbers of students.|$|E
5|$|When {{the group}} lands in Kuldahar, they {{discover}} {{it has been}} invaded by the Legion of the Chimera. They meet the Archdruid of Kuldahar, who tells them that a portal has been opened to allow yuan-ti from the Jungles of Chult to assault Kuldahar. After the group prevents the attack, the Archdruid tells them that they may reach the Severed Hand through an exit at the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> of the Dragon's Eye. The group travels through Dragon's Eye, and proceeds to the Severed Hand. Once inside, they learn that the war between the Ten Towns and the Legion of the Chimera {{was caused by the}} mayor of Bryn Shander, who had sent Isair and Madae poisoned food. They also discover that a mythal that was cast on the Severed Hand has been corrupted, and the structure will be transported to the plane of limbo. Eventually, the group finds Isair and Madae, and kills them.|$|E
5|$|Climbing the tower, {{the party}} discovers {{the remains of}} a family that {{attempted}} to reach Paradise but failed, and a library suggesting Ashura is controlled by someone else. They encounter him at the top, guarding the final door; he offers each of them control of one of the worlds, but they refuse and defeat him. Before they can pass through the door, a trap drops them to the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor.</b> Encountering the allies they made along their journey, they decide to rescale the tower. As they climb stairs that wrap outside of the tower, they engage each of the fiends revived and defeat them. They find the Creator at the summit, and learn that the fiends and the tower itself are actually part of a game created by him to see heroes defeat evil; for succeeding they would be granted a wish as a reward. Angry at his manipulation, they reject the reward and challenge the Creator, who insists that because he created everything he was allowed to use them as he saw fit. They then attack and defeat the Creator in a fierce battle. The heroes then discover a door leading to an unknown location; they consider entering, but decide to return to their own world.|$|E

5|$|The detectives {{are shocked}} {{at the lack of}} homicide-related calls they are {{receiving}} throughout the night. Bolander (Ned Beatty) tries several times throughout the night to call Medical Examiner Blythe (Wendy Hughes) and ask her out on a date, but he cannot build up the courage. With encouragement from Howard (Melissa Leo), he finally asks Blythe out and is shocked when she accepts. Crosetti (Jon Polito) gets agitated when his daughter calls and wants her boyfriend to sleep over. Gee comforts Crosetti and lets him go home to take care of her. Gee finds a baby boy in a small animal carrier-like cage on the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> of the police department. The baby is very popular with the detectives, who take care of him while they wait for social services to arrive.

25|$|The {{double-deck}} design usually includes {{lowering the}} <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> to below {{the top level}} of the wheels, closer to the rails, and then adding an upper floor above. Such a design will fit under more bridges, tunnels and power wires (structure gauge). For cost and safety, this design also minimizes car height (loading gauge) and lowers the centre of gravity.|$|E
25|$|The G. Burke Johnston Student Center (most {{commonly}} called GBJ) contains student activities rooms also used as classrooms during the day, a Subway food court, and study areas. On the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> of this three-story building is {{the entrance to}} the Pamplin tunnel, which connects this building with the adjacent Pamplin Hall; there is also a bridge on the third floor connecting it to Burruss Hall.|$|E
25|$|The {{city was}} once home to two Carnegie libraries, the Main Building and the Cooper Library in Johnson Park. The city's once {{extensive}} library {{system has been}} beleaguered by financial difficulties and in 2010 threatened to close {{at the end of}} the year, but was incorporated into the county system. The main branch closed in February 2011, and was later reopened by the county in the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> of the Paul Robeson Library at Rutgers University.|$|E
50|$|Construction on the {{building}} started in March, 1970, {{and was ready to}} be moved in on January 22, 1973.

Tables with computers and spaces for students or staff to use as desks are available on all floors.|$|E
25|$|The Fuller-White House (built 1905) at 229 West Union Street in Minden, {{is located}} {{down a hill}} from the front campus of Minden High School. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The house has five upstairs bedrooms, with parlors, a study, and kitchen on the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor.</b> It is not open for public touring, but the {{caretaker}} may conduct individual tours when {{he is on the}} property. Fuller lived there for at least the last five years of his life. After his death, Alma Fuller resided there as she continued publishing The Webster Signal.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} each room is {{interpreted}} {{based primarily on}} its design. As a result, there can be some ambiguity in what individual chambers were used for. Each floor was divided into three chambers, {{the largest in the}} west, a smaller room in the north-east, and the chapel taking up the entrance and upper floors of the south-east. As was typical of most keeps, the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> was an undercroft used for storage. One of the rooms contained a well. Although the layout has remained the same since the tower's construction, the interior of the basement dates mostly from the 18thcentury when the floor was lowered and the pre-existing timber vaults were replaced with brick counterparts. The basement is lit through small slits. The sole access to the floor was via the north-east staircase turret.|$|E
5000|$|... == Architecture == Trods Katholm is {{an example}} of {{classical}} architecture with a strong symmetry. It {{is believed to be the}} first brick building south of the Aarhus River, built on the edge of the city as it was expanding towards the coast. Originally the building was both longer and taller and today only the two <b>bottom</b> <b>floors</b> are preserved.|$|R

25|$|The {{university}} runs twelve different residence halls, {{ranging from}} undergraduate residence halls (both themed and non-themed) and family student housing, to re-entry student housing and optional international student housing at the International House. Undergraduate residence halls are located off-campus {{in the city}} of Berkeley. Units 1, 2 and 3, located {{on the south side of}} campus, offer high-rise accommodations with common areas on every other floor. Units 1 and 2 share a common dining hall, called Crossroads. The oldest unit, Unit 3, is the oldest of the three and has its own dining hall on the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> called Cafe 3. Further away and also on the south side of campus is Clark Kerr, an undergraduate residence hall complex that houses many student athletes and was once a school for the deaf and blind.|$|E
25|$|When {{sales of}} the Sylvia Stretcher declined, Kenny {{returned}} to home nursing. During one of her sales journeys, she met a family who arranged for her to visit their station west of Townsville in 1929 {{to care for their}} niece Maude, who was disabled by polio. After 18 months under Kenny's care, Maude was able to walk, return to Townsville, marry and conceive a child. The newspapers in Townsville took up the story, referring to it as a cure. In 1932, Queensland suffered its highest number of polio cases in 30 years; the following year, several local people helped Kenny set up a rudimentary polio-treatment facility under canopies behind the Queens Hotel in Townsville. In a few months (after further success with local children), she moved into the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> of the hotel. The first official evaluation of Sister Kenny's work took place in Townsville in 1934, {{under the auspices of the}} Queensland Health Department (QHD). This evaluation of her work led to the establishment of Kenny clinics in several cities in Australia. The Sister Kenny Clinic in the Outpatients Building of the Rockhampton Base Hospital is now listed on the Queensland Heritage Register.|$|E
25|$|The {{remains of}} the canon's dorter or {{dormitory}} are slight. It was probably a two-storey building, with the <b>bottom</b> <b>floor</b> used for storage – like the frater – and for a warming house. At the northern end, the dorter is backed by Longnor's Garden, the area set out by the abbot for culinary and medicinal herbs, which contained a dovecote in the 15th century. The present guidebook suggests that the dorter was divided in the 15th century to provide quarters for the prior, the abbot's deputy. However, {{the text of the}} 1459 agreement between Abbot Richard Burnell and the canons, covering the responsibilities of the prior, suggests that the prior's quarters were under the dorter, with an entrance from the cloister, next to the parlour, and access to Longnor's garden at the rear. They had been refurbished at considerable cost and effort by a former prior, William of Shrewsbury, then still living, and were to pass to his successors only after his death. At {{the southern end of the}} dorter, a doorway led to the reredorter, the communal washing and latrine block. Although the facilities themselves have gone, there is a very clear length of stone drain, still supplied by a diverted stream.|$|E
50|$|In the West End, it {{was clear}} {{from the start of the}} {{building}} behind the castle and in Homansbyen that businesses - with the exception of grocery stores - were not allowed. The intention was to avoid dirt, noise and an outlook strongly reflecting the worker class. In the East End, the <b>bottom</b> <b>floors</b> and inner yard buildings were dominated by small businesses and there were factory areas, such as those along the Akerselva river and in Dælenenga.|$|R
25|$|The school {{conducted}} a controlled evacuation at approximately 4:00p.m. in which classes were evacuated {{one by one}} while being escorted by heavily armed police officers. ERT officers were standing and patrolling in NWSS's hallways along the way. Students and staff were instructed by the principal to follow ERT officers' directions to leave the school in the quickest way possible. The top floor of Pearson wing was evacuated first, followed by the top floor in Massey wing, and then the <b>bottom</b> <b>floors</b> of Pearson wing, and Massey wing.|$|R
