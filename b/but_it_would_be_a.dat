5|$|It was {{customary}} in {{mid-19th century}} America {{for a candidate}} for high office not to appear to seek it. Thus, Fillmore remained at the comptroller's office in Albany, and made no speeches; the 1848 campaign was conducted in the newspapers and with addresses made by surrogates at rallies. The Democrats nominated Michigan Senator Lewis Cass for president, with General William O. Butler his running mate, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> three-way fight as the Free Soil Party, opposed {{to the spread of}} slavery, chose former president Van Buren. There was a crisis among the Whigs when Taylor also accepted the presidential nomination of a group of dissident South Carolina Democrats. Fearing that Taylor would be an party apostate like Tyler, Weed in late August scheduled a rally in Albany aimed at electing an uncommitted slate of presidential electors, but Fillmore interceded with the editor, assuring him that Taylor was loyal to the party.|$|E
5|$|With {{the worst}} of the aircraft's {{problems}} believed to have been resolved, the XR-1 was submitted for service testing by the Army Air Forces in 1943. During the course of the Army's evaluations, the XR-1's empennage failed during structural testing, the surfaces being strengthened as a result and testing, following the repairs, resuming in 1944. Despite the modifications to the design, however, the XR-1 still proved to be deficient in control authority. In July 1943, the XR-1 program suffered a setback when the aircraft crashed, seriously injuring test pilot Jim Ray, who had replaced Leavitt following the latter's dismissal from the company. The crash was caused by an inspector's error in leaving a suspect part on the aircraft, the rotor hub failing in flight {{as a result of the}} decision. The aircraft was repairable, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> year before the XR-1 was ready to fly again.|$|E
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. One advertisement claimed, likely in error, that this film {{was based on the}} play The Man of the Hour. Written by George Broadhurst, the play focused on political corruption in the form of graft, but the play itself was apparently inspired by politicians of New York. The plot of the film includes a nod to the Women's suffrage movement, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> decade before the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibited any United States citizen from being denied the right to vote on the basis of sex. The character, Congressman Casey, would later be seen again in Orator, Knight and Cow Charmer. The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. There are no known credits for the cast, but Anna Rosemond and Frank H. Crane are two possible actors that were prominent players in 1910. Credits may have included Anna Rosemond, one of two leading ladies of the Thanhouser company in this era. Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company and also involved since the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions. A surviving film still leaves open the possibility of identifying two characters.|$|E

25|$|In 1973, the city's {{graffiti}} epidemic surged {{to levels}} never seen before; nearly every subway car was tagged with graffiti {{by the end}} of the year. It was aided by the budgetary restraints on New York City, which limited its ability to remove graffiti and perform transit maintenance. Mayor John Lindsay declared the first war on graffiti in 1972, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> while before the city was able and willing to dedicate enough resources to that problem to start impacting the growing subculture. The MTA tried rubbing the graffiti off with an acid solution, but maintaining the cars to keep them relatively graffiti-free was costing them around $1.3 million annually. In winter 1973, the car-washing program was stopped. In September 1974, exterior washing with an acid solution started, but the solution was found to have caused more harm than good.|$|E

500|$|Although {{the loss}} of Asia Minor proved irreversible, successes in Epirus and Thessaly led to a {{consolidation}} of the Empire in the Greek-speaking lands of the southern Balkans. Andronikos III and Kantakouzenos planned further campaigns to recover the Latin principalities of southern Greece, a project of major long-term importance, for, as the historian Donald Nicol writes, [...] "if the whole peninsula of Greece could be united under Byzantine government then the Empire would once again be a homogeneous structure, {{able to stand up}} to the Serbians, the Italians and its other enemies. It would be small, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> compact and manageable economic and administrative unit running from Cape Matapan to Thessalonica and Constantinople".|$|E
500|$|Around 796, Æthelhard was deposed by King Eadberht III Præn of Kent because Æthelhard {{had been}} {{appointed}} by Offa. Offa had died in 796, and Eadberht seized control of Kent, forcing Æthelhard to flee {{to the court of}} Offa's son Ecgfrith of Mercia. Ecgfrith himself died before 796, and a distant relative Coenwulf took the throne. Alcuin encouraged Æthelhard to return to Canterbury, and suggested a compromise over the status of Lichfield, which had been established by Offa in rivalry to Canterbury. Alcuin's plan would have allowed Hygberht to retain archiepiscopal status during his lifetime, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> purely ceremonial rank. In this proposal, Canterbury would regain its status as the only archbishopric south of the Humber and Æthelhard would return to Canterbury. However, Æthelhard was unable to do this while Eadberht was still in power. Alcuin had previously stated that Lichfield had been elevated because of a [...] "lust for power", presumably by Offa, and not through any consideration of the merits of the plan.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the Democrats had {{assembled}} in Chicago on July 8, 1884 to begin their convention, the Republicans had already picked their nominee: James G. Blaine of Maine. [...] Blaine's nomination turned many reform-minded Republicans (known as Mugwumps) away from their party. [...] Bayard and Cleveland, seen as honest politicians, were the Democrats most favored by the renegade Republican faction. [...] Bayard was optimistic {{at the start of}} the convention, but the results of the first ballot ran heavily against him: 170 votes to Cleveland's 392. [...] The reason was the same as in 1880: as Congressman Robert S. Stevens of New York said, [...] "I believe if he were President his Administration would be one in which every American citizen would take pride. I believe he is a patriot, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> suicidal attempt to nominate him. His [...] Dover speech would be sent into every household in the North." [...] The voting the next day demonstrated the point, as Cleveland was nominated on the second ballot.|$|E

500|$|Mrs. Puff's {{development}} {{originated with}} {{a request by}} Nickelodeon that SpongeBob attend a school. Nickelodeon initially wanted to make SpongeBob a child since their most successful cartoons at the time focused on young, school-age characters. Hillenburg stated that the network wanted SpongeBob to be like [...] "Arnold [...] under the sea," [...] but he told them, [...] "No, that's not the show." [...] As a compromise, Hillenburg decided to [...] "put him in school - <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] driving school"; this allowed him to keep writing SpongeBob as an adult while also using the school as a main plot element. Showrunner Vincent Waller suggested that if the network had creative control over the show, almost every episode would take place at Mrs. Puff's school, not {{at a variety of}} locations. The choice to make Mrs. Puff a blowfish, who inflates into a ball when SpongeBob crashes, was made to evoke the appearance of car airbags. Because she was created late in production, her design incorporates elements of the earlier characters' appearances, such as the same type of skirt as Pearl and the same rounded teeth as Squidward.|$|E

2500|$|A British railway {{historian}} [...] {{claims that}} the Soviet objective was to limit investment in railway improvements so that railways could barely meet the new and heavy demands for increased transport placed on them by industrialization, thereby allowing more capital for such industrialization. [...] While there were significant investments made in railways, they were not enough to avoid the failure at times to transport all the goods, especially in early 1931 and 1933 which were called [...] "crises". [...] Some of these resulted in shutdowns of production. [...] However, in other cases [...] "crisis" [...] was used to describe {{a situation where the}} stocks of inputs stored at a plant (such as iron ore at a steel mill) almost ran out due the railways failure to deliver on time.

2500|$|Dapu (打譜) is the transcribing of old tablature into a playable form. Since qin tablature {{does not}} {{indicate}} note value, tempo or rhythm, the player must work it out for him/herself. Normally, qin players will learn the rhythm of a piece through a teacher or master. They sit facing one another, with the student copying the master. The tablature will only be consulted if the teacher is not sure of how to play a certain part. Because of this, traditional qinpu do not indicate them (though {{near the end of}} the Qing dynasty, a handful of qinpu had started to employ various rhythm indicating devices, such as dots). If one did not have a teacher, then one had to work out the rhythm by themselves. <b>But</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> mistake to assume that qin music is devoid of rhythm and melody. By the 20th century, there had been attempts to try to replace the [...] "jianzi pu" [...] notation, but so far, it has been unsuccessful; since the 20th century, qin music is generally printed with staff notation above the qin tablature. Because qin tablature is so useful, logical, easy, and the fastest way (once the performer knows how to read the notation) of learning a piece, it is invaluable to the qin player and cannot totally be replaced (just as staff notation cannot be replaced for Western instruments, because they developed a notation system that suited the instruments well).|$|E
