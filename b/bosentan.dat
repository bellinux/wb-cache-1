25|$|Pulmonary {{hypertension}} may {{be treated}} with epoprostenol, treprostinil, <b>bosentan</b> and possibly aerolized iloprost.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostaglandin}} iloprost is used {{to manage}} critical ischemia and pulmonary hypertension in RP, and the endothelin receptor antagonist <b>bosentan</b> {{is used to}} manage severe pulmonary hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma.|$|E
25|$|NET is {{partially}} metabolized via hydroxylation by CYP3A4, and inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can significantly alter circulating levels of NET. For instance, the CYP3A4 inducers rifampicin and <b>bosentan</b> {{have been found}} to decrease NET exposure by 42% and 23%, respectively, and the CYP3A4 inducers carbamazepine and St. John's wort have also been found to accelerate NET clearance.|$|E
25|$|Mesuximide {{increases}} plasma {{levels of}} phenobarbital in primidone users, both primidone and phenobarbital accelerate the metabolism of carbamazepine via CYP3A4, and lamotrigine's apparent clearance is increased by primidone. In {{addition to being}} an inducer of CYP3A4, {{it is also an}} inducer of CYP1A2, which causes it to interact with substrates such as fluvoxamine, clozapine, olanzapine, and tricyclic antidepressants. It also interacts with CYP2B6 substrates such as bupropion, efavirenz, promethazine, selegiline, and sertraline; CYP2C8 substrates such as amiodarone, paclitaxel, pioglitazone, repaglinide, and rosiglitazone; and CYP2C9 substrates such as <b>bosentan,</b> celecoxib, dapsone, fluoxetine, glimepiride, glipizide, losartan, montelukast, nateglinide, paclitaxel, phenytoin, sulfonamides, trimethoprim, warfarin, and zafirlukast. It also interacts with estrogens.|$|E
25|$|Co-administration of {{atorvastatin}} {{with one}} of CYP3A4 inhibitors such as itraconazole, telithromycin, and voriconazole, may increase serum concentrations of atorvastatin, which may lead to adverse reactions. This {{is less likely to}} happen with other CYP3A4 inhibitors such as diltiazem, erythromycin, fluconazole, ketoconazole, clarithromycin, cyclosporine, protease inhibitors, or verapamil, and only rarely with other CYP3A4 inhibitors, such as amiodarone and aprepitant. Often, <b>bosentan,</b> fosphenytoin, and phenytoin, which are CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Only rarely, though, barbiturates, carbamazepine, efavirenz, nevirapine, oxcarbazepine, rifampin, and rifamycin, which are also CYP3A4 inducers, can decrease the plasma concentrations of atorvastatin. Oral contraceptives increased AUC values for norethisterone and ethinylestradiol; these increases should be considered when selecting an oral contraceptive for a woman taking atorvastatin.|$|E
2500|$|Topical {{treatment}} for the skin changes of scleroderma do not alter the disease course, but may improve pain and ulceration. A range of NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) {{can be used to}} ease painful symptoms, such as naproxen. There is limited benefit from steroids such as prednisone. Episodes of Raynaud's phenomenon sometimes respond to nifedipine or other calcium channel blockers; severe digital ulceration may respond to prostacyclin analogue iloprost, and the dual endothelin-receptor antagonist <b>bosentan</b> may be beneficial for Raynaud's phenomenon. The skin tightness may be treated systemically with methotrexate and ciclosporin. and the skin [...] thickness treated with penicillamine.|$|E

50|$|By 2013 {{worldwide}} {{sales of}} <b>bosentan</b> were $1.57 billion. The patents on <b>bosentan</b> started expiring in 2015.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bosentan</b> is a {{competitive}} antagonist of endothelin-1 at the endothelin-A (ET-A) and endothelin-B (ET-B) receptors. Under normal conditions, endothelin-1 binding of ET-A or ET-B receptors causes constriction of the pulmonary blood vessels. By blocking this interaction, <b>bosentan</b> decreases pulmonary vascular resistance. <b>Bosentan</b> {{has a slightly}} higher affinity for ET-A than ET-B.|$|E
50|$|People taking {{cyclosporine}} or glyburide cannot also {{be prescribed}} <b>bosentan.</b>|$|E

5000|$|... dual antagonists (<b>bosentan,</b> macitentan, tezosentan), which affect both endothelin A and B receptors.|$|E
5000|$|Sitaxentan {{is a small}} {{molecule}} {{that blocks}} the action of endothelin (ET) on the endothelin-A (ETA) receptor selectively (by a factor of 6000 compared with the ETB). [...] It is a sulfonamide class endothelin receptor antagonist (ERA) and is undergoing Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for treating pulmonary hypertension. The rationale for benefit compared with <b>bosentan,</b> a nonselective ET blocker, is negligible inhibition of the beneficial effects of ETB stimulation, such as nitric oxide production and clearance of ET from circulation. In clinical trials, the efficacy of sitaxentan has been {{much the same as}} <b>bosentan,</b> but the hepatotoxicity of sitaxentan outweighs its benefits. Dosing is once daily, as opposed to twice daily for <b>bosentan.</b>|$|E
50|$|Sitaxentan, ambrisentan and <b>bosentan</b> {{are mainly}} {{used for the}} {{treatment}} of pulmonary arterial hypertension, while atrasentan is an experimental anti-cancer drug.|$|E
50|$|Macitentan has slow {{association}} kinetics. Its potency increases 6.3-fold {{when it is}} pre-incubated with pulmonary arterial {{smooth muscle}} cells for 120 minutes compared to 10 minutes with pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells. Macitentan also has a high receptor occupancy half-life (approximately 17 minutes) compared to <b>bosentan</b> (approximately 70 seconds) and ambrisentan (approximately 40 seconds). This increased receptor occupancy half-life allows macitentan {{to act as a}} non-competitive antagonist of ET receptors. <b>Bosentan</b> and ambrisentan are both competitive antagonists.|$|E
50|$|Endothelin-1 {{receptor}} antagonists (<b>Bosentan)</b> {{are used}} in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension. Inhibition of these receptors prevents pulmonary vasculature constriction and thus decreases pulmonary vascular resistance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{prostaglandin}} iloprost is used {{to manage}} critical ischemia and pulmonary hypertension in RP, and the endothelin receptor antagonist <b>bosentan</b> {{is used to}} manage severe pulmonary hypertension and prevent finger ulcers in scleroderma.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{to the risk of}} causing birth defects and of causing liver damage, <b>bosentan</b> has a high risk of causing edema, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease, decreasing sperm counts, and decreases in hemoglobin and hematocrit.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bosentan</b> is used {{to treat}} people with {{moderate}} pulmonary arterial hypertension and {{to reduce the number}} of digital ulcers — open wounds on especially on fingertips and less commonly the knuckles — in people with systemic scleroderma.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bosentan</b> {{belongs to}} {{a new class of}} drug and works by {{blocking}} the receptors of the hormone endothelin. It is specifically indicated only for the treatment of pulmonary artery hypertension in patients with moderate to severe heart failure.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bosentan</b> was {{studied in}} heart failure {{in a trial}} called REACH-1 that was {{terminated}} early in 1997 due to toxicity at the dose that was being studied; as of 2001 {{the results of that}} trial had not been published.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bosentan</b> causes harm to fetuses and {{pregnant}} women must not take it, and women must not become pregnant while taking it (Pregnancy Category X). It may render hormonal contraceptives ineffective so {{other forms of}} birth control must be used.|$|E
50|$|NTCP is a cell surface {{receptor}} {{necessary for}} the entry of hepatitis B and hepatitis D virus. This entry mechanism is inhibited by myrcludex B, cyclosporin A, progesterone, propranolol, <b>bosentan,</b> ezetimibe, as well as NTCP substrates like taurocholate, tauroursodeoxycholate and bromosulfophthalein.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bosentan</b> is a dual endothelin {{receptor}} antagonist used in {{the treatment}} of pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). It is licensed in the United States, the European Union and other countries by Actelion Pharmaceuticals for the management of PAH under the trade name Tracleer.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{treatments}} {{have been investigated}} {{in the past for}} IPF, including interferon gamma-1β, <b>bosentan,</b> ambrisentan, and anticoagulants, but these are no longer considered effective treatment options. Many of these earlier studies were based on the hypothesis that IPF is an inflammatory disorder.|$|E
50|$|Sildenafil {{has shown}} promise in the {{treatment}} of congestive cardiac failure. A study showed that effective treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension with sildenafil improved functional capacity and reduced right ventricular mass in patients. The effects on right ventricular remodeling were significantly greater in comparison with the non-selective endothelia receptor antagonist <b>bosentan.</b>|$|E
50|$|There is no cure. Treatment {{depends on}} the type of disease. A number of {{supportive}} measures such as oxygen therapy, diuretics, and medications to inhibit clotting may be used. Medications specifically for the condition include epoprostenol, treprostinil, iloprost, <b>bosentan,</b> ambrisentan, macitentan, and sildenafil. A lung transplant may be an option in certain cases.|$|E
50|$|NET is {{partially}} metabolized via hydroxylation by CYP3A4, and inhibitors and inducers of CYP3A4 can significantly alter circulating levels of NET.

50|$|The dual (ETA and ETB) endothelin {{receptor}} antagonist <b>bosentan</b> {{was approved}} in 2001. Sitaxentan (Thelin) was approved {{for use in}} Canada, Australia, and the European Union, {{but not in the}} United States. In 2010, Pfizer withdrew Thelin worldwide because of fatal liver complications. A similar drug, ambrisentan is marketed as Letairis in the U.S. by Gilead Sciences.|$|E
50|$|Overproduction of endothelin in {{the lungs}} may cause {{pulmonary}} hypertension, which can sometimes be treated {{by the use of}} an endothelin receptor antagonist, such as <b>bosentan,</b> sitaxentan or ambrisentan. The latter drug selectively blocks endothelin A receptors, decreasing the vasoconstrictive actions and allowing for increased beneficial effects of endothelin B stimulation, such as nitric oxide production. The precise effects of endothelin B receptor activation depends on the type of cells involved.|$|E
50|$|In {{pharmaceutical}} technology acidic pharmaceutical substances {{are often}} converted into sodium salts, {{because they are}} more stable, more soluble or membrane-permeable than the drug itself. Example of such sodium salts are (selection): Bispyribac, bithionol, <b>bosentan,</b> brequinar, bromfenac, Cefmenoxime, ceftiofur, citicoline, diclofenac , Floxacillin, fosinopril, naproxen, Netobimin, ozagrel, pantoprazole, pemetrexed, sitamaquin, sitaxentan, sulfamiderazin, sulfapyridine, sulfaquinoxaline, sulfathiazole, sulfazecin, thiamylal and mesna. The disodium salt of cromolyn is also used as drug. Most of these salts are sodium salts of organic carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids.|$|E
50|$|Macitentan (trade name Opsumit) is an endothelin {{receptor}} antagonist (ERA) {{approved for}} the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). The other two ERAs marketed as of 2014 are <b>bosentan</b> and ambrisentan. Macitentan is a dual ERA, meaning that it acts as an antagonist of two endothelin (ET) receptor subtypes, ETA and ETB. However, macitentan has a 50-fold increased selectivity for the ETA subtype compared to the ETB subtype. The drug received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on October 13, 2013.|$|E
5000|$|In the US {{it is only}} {{available}} from doctors who follow an FDA-mandated risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) with respect to risks to fetuses and its risks of causing liver damage. The doctor must document a negative pregnancy test for women before prescribing the drug, counsel about contraception, and give regular pregnancy tests. [...] Because {{there is a high}} risk that <b>bosentan</b> causes liver damage, the REMS plan also requires pre-testing for elevated transaminases and regular testing while the drug is being taken.|$|E
50|$|The newest {{generation}} in PPH pharmacy shows great promise. <b>Bosentan</b> is a nonspecific endothelin-receptor antagonist capable of neutralizing the most identifiable cirrhosis associated vasoconstrictor, safely and efficaciously improving oxygenation and PVR, especially {{in conjunction with}} sildenafil. Finally, where the high pressures and pulmonary tree irritations of PPH cause a medial thickening of the vessels (smooth muscle migration and hyperplasia), one can remove the cause -control the pressure, transplant the liver - yet those morphological changes persist, sometimes necessitating lung transplantation. Imatinib, designed to treat chronic myeloid leukemia, {{has been shown to}} reverse the pulmonary remodeling associated with PPH.|$|E
