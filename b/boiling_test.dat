40|$|The {{main purpose}} of asphalt mixture {{production}} is the coating of mineral aggregates with asphalt binder within a reasonable time frame. Coating is required as it affects mixtures workability (e. g., lubricant effect of binder film), as well as durability (e. g., preventing mixtures from moisture damage). However, mixing time needs to be controlled since it greatly influences both plant productivity (i. e., amount of mixture produced per hour) and binder aging, which {{is caused by the}} loss in volatiles due to temperature and air flow during mixing. In light of this, mixing temperature is selected to properly reduce binder?s viscosity below a limit to ensure proper coating in a time frame of 90 seconds. Current viscosity limits used for selecting mixing and compaction temperatures are valid only for unmodified binders, which generally exhibit a linear Newtonian behavior; furthermore, the literature indicates that these limits were introduced solely based on practical considerations without a fundamental understanding of the physical and chemical processes driving the production of this material. A guideline for the selection of compaction temperatures for modified binders, which are nowadays very popular, is not available to practitioners. Mixing temperatures calculated based on current recommendations for viscosity limits are often higher than 150 �C and they become even more excessive when modified binders are used. The usage of these temperatures raises concerns in terms of energy cost, sustainability and safety. Thus, transportation agencies and practitioners are currently challenged with the need of reducing the mixing temperatures during production without negatively affecting the level of coating or performance of mixtures. This can only be accomplished by providing a clear understanding of the main factors and variables that affect coating, and by showing the influence of coating on the susceptibility of asphalt mixtures to moisture damage. Reducing mixing temperatures will result in increasing viscosity. The effect of increased viscosity on both coating and the adhesive bond between the binder and aggregates has not been properly investigated in the past. In this thesis, effects of coating are considered based on two different points of view: (a) extent of coating, which is defined as the amount of dry aggregates coated by binder after mixing for a given time before compaction; and (b) the quality of coating which is defined as a qualitative description of the adhesive bond between binder and aggregate. Initially a procedure based on aggregates water absorption (ASTM C 127 ? 07) was developed for determining the extent of coating. Results from this procedure showed that the extent of coating is affected by low shear viscosity and asphalt content, but highlighted that the extent of coating is not sufficient for assessing moisture susceptibility of mixtures. It was determined that moisture damage of mixtures is more dependent on the binder-aggregate bond strength rather than the extent of coating. For this reason, a modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> procedure based on the ASTM D 3625 ? 1996 was introduced and developed for evaluating the quality of coating. Results from the modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> have shown that the quality of coating is highly affected by low shear viscosity, binder modification, and aggregate type. Furthermore, a time-dependency effect of the quality of coating was observed for certain combinations of asphalt binders and aggregates. The analysis of the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> results, which is based on visual inspection of aggregates surface post boiling, was validated using the acid ? base titration procedure recommended in the UNI EN 12697 - 11 2012 (E). In addition, the Bitumen Bond Strength (BBS) test (AASHTO TP 91 - 12), was included in the experimental study to evaluate if the application/production temperature affects the moisture susceptibility of the inderaggregates systems. Results showed that the modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> and the BBS test are correlated. Furthermore, the boiling procedure was validated using the Indirect Tensile Strength (ITS) test, (AASHTO T 283). A preliminary correlation between the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> and the ITS showed that the proposed procedure is promising for the evaluation of the quality of coating and {{can be used as a}} surrogate for estimating the susceptibility of asphalt mixtures to moisture damage. The ITS results in combination with the analysis from the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> were used to provide preliminary design limits. Results from this thesis show that quantifying the extent of coating is not sufficient for predicting moisture susceptibility. Indeed, the quality of coating needs to be considered when assessing moisture damage of mixtures. Findings from the modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> have pointed out that the quality of coating is affected not only by viscosity, but also by binder modification and aggregate type. In summary, the developed modified <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> can be used as a simple procedure for selecting mixing temperature that will ensure sufficient extent and quality of coating, both of which have significant effect on asphalt-aggregate mixture moisture susceptibility...|$|E

40|$|Executive Summary Cold Mix Asphalt (CMA) {{serves as}} a {{promising}} alternative {{for a wide range}} of paving applications from preventative maintenance and repair, to full-scale pavement construction. Compared to traditional Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) and Warm Mix Asphalt (WMA), CMA provides a number of benefits that make it a promising alternative to conventional paving technologies, including reduction in heating energy and longer working time for transportation and placing. However, the reported higher air void content and higher moisture susceptibility of CMA relative to traditional HMA present legitimate concerns that has limited more widespread use of CMA to date. To mitigate the potential for moisture damage in CMA, it is necessary to include a simple and effective method for evaluating moisture susceptibility in the material selection phase of the mix design process. The most direct way to prevent moisture sensitivity is to require a minimum threshold of aggregate coating as part of CMA mix design in regards to both extent and quality of coating. This study refines a recently developed method to quantify aggregate coating extent in CMA using Digital Image Analysis Methods and applies the procedure to several aggregate-emulsion systems to isolate factors most directly affecting aggregate coating. After identifying the most significant factors, a regression analysis of the experimental results is used to develop quantitative models to predict coating of aggregates in CMA as a function of mix design parameters. Results show that not only Image Analysis Method {{serves as a}}n effective and reliable tool in identifying aggregate coating, but also that the regression models developed to predict coating are sensitive to emulsion type, aggregate gradation and residual asphalt content. Including evaluation of coating quality is a generally accepted practice in mix design for conventional HMA, WMA, and CMA. This study introduces the concept that it is necessary to assess quality of coating as a means to ensure adequate bonding between the asphalt and aggregate to truly assess potential for moisture damage. To evaluate quality of coating, a Modified <b>Boiling</b> <b>Test</b> procedure on cured CMA loose mixture that involves application of the Image Analysis Method to quantify the coating before and after boiling was developed. Results reveal that after curing is achieved as indicated by negligible moisture loss in the mixture, the bonding between emulsion residue and aggregate continues to increases with curing time. Modified <b>Boiling</b> <b>Test</b> results on fully cured CMA loose mixture indicate that CSS- 1 hl performs much better than CSS- 1 h and CSS- 2 emulsion, showing the best coating quality. The results were also verified by Binder Bond Strength (BBS) test on emulsion residues and asphalt emulsions. The relationship between coating quality and mixture performance was verified through comparison of <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> results to mixture moisture damage as measured by the Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR). Prior to conducting this comparison a CMA mix design method was proposed to ensure a uniform process for selection of design emulsion content and preparation of mixture samples. The proposed CMA mix design method determines the design emulsion content (DEC) based on volumetric analysis and mixture indirect tensile strength. The Tensile Strength Ratio (TSR) test based on this mix design shows consistency with Modified <b>Boiling</b> <b>test</b> result and correlation between TSR test and Modified <b>Boiling</b> <b>test</b> is also established...|$|E

30|$|Fiberboards were {{prepared}} from acetylated fibers with various weight gains: 0, 4.7, 9.4, 18.5, and 24.8 weight percent gain (WPG). The effects of low bondability of acetylated fibers on mechanical properties and dimensional changes were determined. The decreased mechanical properties of acetylated fiberboard are mainly due to low bondability. To improve bending strength, high face density is also needed. The thickness swelling according to JIS and the linear expansion under relative humidity changes decreased with increasing WPG. As for accelerated weathering and the outdoor exposure test, the thickness changes in 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards were {{much higher than}} those in OWPG board and 24.8 WPG board. The high thickness change in 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards is due to low bondability. Although 24.8 WPG board also has low bondability, the thickness change of 24.8 WPG board decreased. The high dimensional stability of acetylated fibers, caused by high WPG, probably outweighs the dimensional change caused by low bondability. On the other hand, during the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> the thickness changes in 24.8 WPG board and the 4.7 – 18.5 WPG boards were higher than those in 0 WPG board. The effect of the <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> on the boards is more severe than that seen with the accelerated weathering and outdoor exposure test; therefore, {{the effects of the}} low bondability probably cancel the effects of the high WPG.

No significant effect was found of the applied modification of the core on bending strength or modulus of elasticity (MOE) determined for the longer axis. In turn, such properties as modulus of rupture (MOR) and MOE, determined for the shorter axis, as well as internal bond (IB) were rapidly reduced. In the case of boards containing 100 % recycled chips in the core, a reduction was found in values of MOR, MOE, and IB by 45 %, 30 %, and 45 %, respectively. In turn, the application of small chips, which previously had not been resinated, makes it possible to manufacture boards with internal bond lower by only 30 %, even at the 100 % substitution.

Bulk raw milk was collected monthly at 50 dairy farms from January 2007 to October 2009 and physicochemical attributes, somatic cell (SCC), and total bacterial counts (TBC) were determined. Milk samples were classified into low, medium, and high stability to ethanol test when coagulation occurred at 72 °GL, between 74 and 78 °GL, and above 78 °GL, respectively. Univariate analysis was performed considering the effects of year, months, and interaction in a completely randomized design. Principal factor analysis and logistic regression were done. There was an interaction between months and years for stability to the ethanol test and coagulation time. All samples were stable at the <b>boiling</b> <b>test.</b> <b>Boiling</b> <b>test</b> was not related to ethanol and coagulation time tests. Coagulation time was weakly but positively correlated with ethanol test.

The respective mean values (±sd) at parturition were 0. 20 ± 1 %, 13. 00 ± 1. 03 %, 2. 68 ±. 19 %. Clot on <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> gave a high positive result at the first day, after which, clot intensity steadily decreased till no more clot was observed after 48 hours. A tenfold increase was shown by fat content during the first 24 hours. A sharp decrease was shown by each of the protein, TS, chloride, Sp. gr. and viscosity values during the first 24 hours. Lactose and the freezing point value increased significantly during 48 hours. In contrast, ash and TA decreased significantly during 48 and 36 hours respectively...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an overview of}} the model development and validation of an advanced Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) computer code (CFD-BWR) that allows the detailed analysis of two-phase flow and heat transfer phenomena in Boiling Water Reactor (BWR) fuel bundles. The CFD-BWR code is being developed as a customized module built on the foundation of the commercial CFD-code STAR-CD which provides general two-phase flow modeling capabilities. The model development strategy that has been adopted by the development team for the prediction of boiling flow regimes in a BWR fuel bundle includes the use of local flow topology maps and topology-specific phenomenological models specifically designed for a 3 -dimensional CFD code. The paper reviews the key boiling phenomenological models and focuses on several key experiment analyses for the validation of two-phase BWR phenomena models including flow regime experiments, cladding-to-coolant heat transfer and Critical Heat Flux experiments, and the BWR Full-size Assembly <b>Boiling</b> <b>Test</b> (BFBT). 1...|$|E
40|$|This study {{presents}} {{development of}} a unique, powerful method for cooling high-frequency, AC conductors that can benefit end users of transformer windings, electrical machine windings, and magnet coils. This method of heat removal involves boiling a dielectric, fluorinert refrigerant that is {{in direct contact with}} litz wire conductors. A pool <b>boiling</b> <b>test</b> vessel is constructed, which provides for temperature control of the pool of fluorinert liquid. The test vessel is fitted with viewing ports so that the experiments are observed and studied with the aid of high-speed photography. Tests are performed on a variety of litz wire conductors. The boiling heat transfer coefficient is dependent on the conductor surface roughness. The size of the features on the conductor surface depends on the single-strand wire gage from which the conductor is constructed. All tests are performed with the conductors mounted horizontally. These tests are performed using a DC power supply. The results of these experiments will aid in the design of future cooling systems...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} relations occurring between <b>boiling</b> water <b>test,</b> standard germination test and field emergence of leek (Allium porrum L.) and onion (Allium cepa L.) seeds. In this study, seeds of six lots ('Kalem', 'Ala', '&# 205;neg&# 246;l-A, B, C and D') from three cultivars of leek and seven onion cultivars ('Early Texas Grano' (ETG), 'Panku', 'Storm', 'Banko', 'Aki', 'Kisag&# 252;n' and 'Banka') seeds were used as plant material and their viability was evaluated in <b>boiling</b> water <b>test</b> (BWT), standard germination test (SGT) and field emergence (FE). The percentage of field emergence was evaluated at three sowing times: 20 May (FE-I), 10 June (FE-II) and 20 July (FE-III). The mean germination of leek seeds varied from 77. 5 % to 100. 0 % and from 36. 0 % to 61. 0 % in SGT and BWT, respectively. While the range of results obtained in the <b>boiling</b> water <b>test</b> was from 38. 5 % to 60. 0 %, the range of results of the standard germination test was from 81. 0 % to 100. 0 % in onion seeds. The range of field emergence was between 18. 5 % ('Kisag&# 252;n', FE-III) and 72. 0 % (İnegöl-C', FE-II). Besides, the <b>boiling</b> water <b>test</b> was correlated highly significantly with SGT (r = 0. 670 **), FE-I (r = 0. 923 **), FE-II (r = 0. 906 **) and FE-III (r = 0. 939 **) in leek seeds. Similarly, BWT showed positive correlation with SGT (r = 0. 568 **), FE-I (r = 0. 844 **), FE-II (r = 0. 933 **) and FE-III (r = 0. 858 **) in onion seeds. In conclusion, the <b>boiling</b> water <b>test</b> is a new and reliable technique to test seed viability and it has a great potential to test rapidly germination and field emergence of leek and onion seeds at different sowing times...|$|R
40|$|Medium density fibreboards (MDF) from pine wood {{were made}} using fibres {{generated}} by the conventional thermomechanical pulping (TMP) and chemo-thermomechanical pulping (CTMP). As binders alkaline curing phenolformaldehyde resin (PF-resin), tanninformaldehyde resin (TF-resin) and a binder based on polymeric diphenylmethane diisocyanate (PMDI) were used. The results reveal that boards prepared from CTMP are superior in bending strength, transverse tensile strength and transverse tensile strength after <b>boil</b> <b>test</b> (V 100 value) compared to boards from TMP. However, boards prepared from CTMP are slightly higher in thickness swelling and water absorption, the degree depends on the used resin. Further, {{the results indicate that}} using the blender gluing technique leads to better physical-mechanical properties of the boards than the conventional blowline gluing technique...|$|R
40|$|The sensory {{determination}} of ammonia in raw, steamed and boiled ray wings using a scoring system {{appeared to be}} a valuable method of quality assessment. The borderline of acceptability was reached after 10 (± 1) days in ice. A combination of the steaming and <b>boiling</b> <b>tests</b> (with addition of acetic acid and salt) was useful to confirm definite spoilage or to indicate the approach to the borderline of acceptability. The chemical {{determination of}} ammonia {{appeared to be a}} useful objective method in addition to the organoleptic tests. Thornback ray was borderline at a concentration of 60 – 70 mg N. From the other related parameters determined (urea, pH, redox potential, total bacterial count, a-amino nitrogen) only pH appeared to be of value...|$|R
