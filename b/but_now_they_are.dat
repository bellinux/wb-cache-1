The elections {{used to take}} place every three years, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> held every four years. The municipality mayors are elected by municipality councils. Also, municipality councils appoint elders {{to be in charge}} of an eldership. Currently it is proposed that both mayors and elders should be elected in direct elections.|$|E

In the 19th and 20th centuries egg cases were seen along the entire British coastline in high numbers, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only found in a few selective areas.|$|E
25|$|There {{are about}} 45 subdivisions in the {{municipality}} of low, medium and high density category. The existing residential hub occupies 1,360hectares (13.60km²) of land distributed unevenly in its 12 barangays. These subdivisions used {{to occupy the}} stretch of the roads <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> now developing the inner portions of their barangays. It is expected that within the next ten years, land use development in Santa Maria will represent the sub-urban mix {{which means that the}} government will provide development where the level of accessibility is very high. This will provide for the clustering of lower density land uses to help meet housing, employment and public services needs of the people.|$|E

25|$|In {{the nineteenth}} century, Ibrahim Altynsarin, a {{prominent}} Kazakh educator, first introduced a Cyrillic alphabet for transcribing Kazakh. Russian missionary activity, {{as well as}} Russian-sponsored schools, further encouraged the use of Cyrillic in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries. The alphabet was reworked by Sarsen Amanzholov and accepted in its current form in 1940. It contains 42 letters: 33 from the Russian alphabet with 9 additional letters for sounds of the Kazakh language: Ә, Ғ, Қ, Ң, Ө, Ұ, Ү, Һ, І (until 1957 Ӯ was used instead of Ұ). Initially, Kazakh letters came after letters from the Russian alphabet, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> placed after Russian letters similar in sound or shape.|$|E
25|$|Merlin (Merrdyn) - Merlin is a {{powerful}} warlock who is several hundred years old {{and may have been}} born in Atlantis. Merlin has been an influential figure for a very long time, working towards a greater goal known to no-one but himself. He was advisor to Vortigern, the last great king of Britain. When Ambrosius Aurelianus and Uther Pendragon killed Vortigen and stole his throne, Merlin appeared to change his allegiance and support Ambrosius until his death, and then Uther when he succeeded him. It is rumoured that he and Morgana had a short, explosive affair, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> sworn enemies. Merlin is hard drinking and often is callous when dealing with other people.|$|E
500|$|The {{national}} colours constitute the portable variants of the National Flag {{for use on}} parades by the military units. In the past, the colours had a practical function, {{being used as a}} signal to guide the military units in battle. Originally, the colours were referred as [...] "regimental flags" [...] (bandeiras regimentais) or [...] "military units flags" [...] (bandeiras das unidades militares), <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> referred as [...] "national standards" [...] (estandartes nacionais). The colours are always carried in parade by a junior officer, escorted by a colour guard.|$|E

500|$|Martingales mathematically formalize {{the idea}} of a fair game, and they were {{originally}} developed to show that {{it is not possible to}} win a fair game. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used in many areas of probability, which is one of the main reasons for studying them. [...] Many problems in probability have been solved by finding a martingale in the problem and studying it. Martingales will converge, given some conditions on their moments, so they are often used to derive convergence results, due largely to martingale convergence theorems ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2006, {{more than}} 30 {{restaurant}} patrons, including {{a group of}} tourists and Democratic Alliance councillor Masizole Mnqasela, were arrested in a police raid for drinking in public. The restaurant did not sell alcohol, but Ngcawuzele explained {{that he could not}} stop people from bringing their own. [...] The incident generated controversy in the local press. Tour operator Ryan Hunt claimed that police swore at the patrons and threatened people for asking questions. [...] "The police created a dangerous situation. People are always encouraged to visit township attractions, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> turned away with that kind of situation," [...] he said. Mnqasela, a member of Cape Town's economic development committee, added, [...] "Mzoli's is internationally acclaimed and is key to township tourism. What kind of message is the police sending?" [...] The African National Congress approved the police actions, citing a need to curtail public drunkenness.|$|E

Similarly, these peoples were a great affliction to Europe; and at the time of Alexander, the Greeks did not have the courage to subjugate them. <b>But</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> much diminished and do not have the reputation they formerly had.

2500|$|On 18 March 2014, Svoboda members posted {{an online}} video of party MPs beating acting National Television Company of Ukraine {{president}} Oleksandr Panteleymonov {{and trying to}} force him to sign a letter of resignation because he broadcast the Crimea ascension to the Russian Federation ceremony in the Kremlin. In the video Panteleymonov's broadcast was called [...] "state treason" [...] by Svoboda MP Miroshnychenko, deputy head of the Parliamentary Committee on Freedom of Speech and Information. Tyahnybok condemned the attack ("Such actions were fine yesterday (during the protests), <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> inappropriate"), which was also condemned by Amnesty International and acting prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk. On 20 March 2014 Svoboda withdrew as observers from the Alliance of European National Movements (AENM) over sympathy by several alliance members for the Russian military intervention, and in June the party formed the Sich Battalion to fight the war in Donbass.|$|E

2500|$|In a 2008 study {{paid for}} by the National Science Foundation in the United States, {{researchers}} found that [...] "girls perform as well as boys on standardized math tests. Although 20 years ago, high school boys performed better than girls in math, the researchers found that is no longer the case. The reason, they said, is simple: Girls used to take fewer advanced math courses than boys, <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> taking just as many." [...] However, the study indicated that, while boys and girls performed similarly on average, boys were over-represented among the very best performers as well as among the very worst. A 2011 meta-analysis with 242 studies from 1990 to 2007 involving 1,286,350 people found no overall sex difference of performance in mathematics. The meta-analysis also found that although there were no overall differences, a small sex difference that favored males in complex problem solving is still present in high school.|$|E
2500|$|Initially, {{the motive}} of the rioters was {{attributed}} to racial tensions <b>but</b> <b>now</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> considered one factor in a larger status quo conflict. Urban sociologist Joel Kotkin agrees, [...] "This wasn't a race riot, it was a class riot." [...] Supporting this is the large misconception that rioters were only African-American; many groups in fact participated. Newsweek reported that [...] "Hispanics and even some whites—men, women and children—mingled with African-Americans." [...] "When residents who lived near Florence and Normandie were asked why they believed riots had occurred in their neighborhoods, they responded of the perceived racist attitudes they had felt throughout their lifetime and empathized with the bitterness the rioters felt. Residents who had respectable jobs, homes, and material items still felt like second-class citizens. A poll by Newsweek asked whether black people charged with crimes were treated more harshly or more leniently and results revealed that 75% of blacks voted more harshly versus 46% of whites.|$|E
