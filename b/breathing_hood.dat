40|$|To {{assess the}} {{influence}} of clothing on dermal uptake of semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), we measured uptake of selected airborne phthalates for an individual wearing clean clothes or air-exposed clothes and compared these results with dermal uptake for bare-skinned individuals under otherwise identical experimental conditions. Using a <b>breathing</b> <b>hood</b> to isolate dermal from inhalation uptake, we measured urinary metabolites of diethylphthalate (DEP) and di-n-butylphthalate (DnBP) from an individual exposed to known concentrations of these compounds for 6 [*]h in an experimental chamber. The individual wore either clean (fresh) cotton clothes or cotton clothes that {{had been exposed to}} the same chamber air concentrations for 9 days. For a 6 -h exposure, the net amounts of DEP and DnBP absorbed when wearing fresh clothes were, respectively, 0. 017 and 0. 007 [*]μg/kg/(μg/m 3); for exposed clothes the results were 0. 178 and 0. 261 [*]μg/kg/(μg/m 3), respectively (values normalized by air concentration and body mass). When compared against the average results for bare-skinned participants, clean clothes were protective, whereas exposed clothes increased dermal uptake for DEP and DnBP by factors of 3. 3 and 6. 5, respectively. Even for non-occupational environments, wearing clothing that has adsorbed/absorbed indoor air pollutants can increase dermal uptake of SVOCs by substantial amounts relative to bare skin...|$|E

50|$|A smoke hood is a {{protective}} device similar in concept to a gas mask. A translucent airtight bag seals around {{the head of}} the wearer while an air filter held in the mouth connects to the outside atmosphere and is used to <b>breathe.</b> Smoke <b>hoods</b> are intended to protect victims of fire from the effects of smoke inhalation.|$|R
5000|$|In the 1990s, {{on behalf}} of the UK fire service, studies were carried out of the {{physiological}} and ergonomic impacts of <b>breathing</b> apparatus, fire <b>hoods</b> and protective clothing. The studies on fire hoods showed that, contrary to common belief, they did not affect the ability of firefighters to localise sound. This led to a recommendation by the UK Home Office that all fire fighters should routinely be issued with such hoods, advice which is now followed throughout the UK. The IOM has helped to assess Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (CBRN) protective clothing for the Home Office, and has recently assisted London Fire Brigade in the ergonomic assessment for selection of new protective clothing [...]|$|R
5000|$|Hooding is the placing of a hood {{over the}} entire head of a prisoner. Hooding is widely {{considered}} to be a form of torture, one legal scholar considers the hooding of prisoners to be a violation of international law, specifically the Third and Fourth Geneva Conventions, which demand that persons under custody or physical control of enemy forces be treated humanely. Hooding is also potentially dangerous, especially when a prisoner's hands are also bound. It is {{considered to be a}}n act of torture when its primary purpose is sensory deprivation during interrogation; it causes [...] "disorientation, isolation, and dread." [...] According to the International Committee of the Red Cross, hooding is used to prevent people from seeing and to disorient them, and also to prevent them from <b>breathing</b> freely. <b>Hooding</b> is sometimes used in conjunction with beatings to increase anxiety as to when and where the blows will fall. Hooding also allows the interrogators to remain anonymous and thus to act with impunity. Moreover, if a group of prisoners is hooded, the interrogator can play them off against each other by pretending, for instance, that some of them are cooperating, which the prisoners will be unable to verify.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a new method for controlling and administering olfactory stimuli [...] -namely, the hood system. The hood system involves a stream of vaporized odor (at known concentrations) mixed with odorless air and pumped (at a constant flow rate) into an oxygen therapy hood. It is designed to be used with odorants in solution, such as essential oils, as the olfactory stimulus. The use of oxygen therapy hoods allows for the precise control of a constant concentration of odorized air over time, while allowing subjects to <b>breathe</b> normally. The <b>hood</b> system provides a natural administration of olfactory stimuli and the exact determination of the stimulus concentration. The use of this system will allow experimental conditions to be completely defined and results and replication studies to be accurately interpreted. The hood system is portable, cost effective, and constructed from readily available components. It is proposed that the hood system could be adopted to suit a wide range of olfactory research, particularly that in which the effects of chronic exposure to olfactory stimuli on cognition are examined...|$|R
