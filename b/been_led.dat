5|$|An {{experimental}} vaccine {{was found}} to clear the amyloid plaques in early human trials, {{but it did not}} have any significant effect on dementia. Researchers have <b>been</b> <b>led</b> to suspect non-plaque Aβ oligomers (aggregates of many monomers) as the primary pathogenic form of Aβ. These toxic oligomers, also referred to as amyloid-derived diffusible ligands (ADDLs), bind to a surface receptor on neurons and change the structure of the synapse, thereby disrupting neuronal communication. One receptor for Aβ oligomers may be the prion protein, the same protein that has been linked to mad cow disease and the related human condition, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, thus potentially linking the underlying mechanism of these neurodegenerative disorders with that of Alzheimer's disease.|$|E

During the minority of emperor PedroII in the 1830s, however, there had been internal rebellions driven by local disputes for power within a few provinces.

5|$|In 1001, Edward's relics (for he was {{considered}} a saint, although never canonized) were translated to a more prominent place within the nunnery at Shaftesbury. The ceremonies {{are said to have}} <b>been</b> <b>led</b> by the then-Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige III, accompanied by a senior cleric whom the Passio calls Elsinus, sometimes identified with Ælfsige, the abbot of the New Minster, Winchester. King Æthelred, preoccupied with the threat of a Danish invasion, did not attend in person, but he issued a charter to the Shaftesbury nuns late in 1001 granting them lands at Bradford on Avon, which is thought to be related. A 13th-century calendar of saints gives the date of this translation as 20 June.|$|E
5|$|In the 1890s, List {{initially}} {{devised the}} idea that ancient German society had <b>been</b> <b>led</b> by a hierarchical system of initiates, the Armanenschaft, an idea which had developed into {{a key part of}} his thinking by 1908. List's image of the Armanenschaft's structure was based largely on his knowledge of Freemasonry. He claimed that the ancient brotherhood had consisted of three degrees, each with their own secret signs, grips, and passwords. He believed that the Armanenschaft had societal control over the ancient German people, acting as teachers, priests, and judges. In List's interpretation of history, the Christian missionaries persecuted the Armanenschaft, resulting in many fleeing northward into Scandinavia and Iceland. He believed that they developed a secretive language for transmitting their teachings, known as kala.|$|E
