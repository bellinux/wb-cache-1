5000|$|All of {{the dinosaurs}} are life-sized, and are animatronic. Some of the animatronic dinosaurs are interactive, {{allowing}} visitors to press buttons on the dinosaur's sign that will control the movement of various body parts depending on where the button is located (e.g. <b>button</b> on <b>snout</b> opens jaws, <b>button</b> on throat thrashes neck, and button on rear makes the tail sway). The non-interactive animatronic dinosaurs are activated when a special sensory camera {{in front of them}} captures movement, and they will begin to move in various ways, depending on which dinosaur or species they are. Accompanying the various movements are roaring, bellowing, and/or shrieking sound effects erupting from hidden speakers to make it seem as though the dinosaurs are calling noisily to one another.|$|R
