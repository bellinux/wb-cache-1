50|$|The area is {{specially}} {{noted for}} {{two species of}} wildlife, the <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> and the long-tailed macaque.|$|E
50|$|Natural {{definitive}} hosts are: dogs, red fox Vulpes vulpes japonica, Japanese {{raccoon dog}} Nyctereutes procyonoides viverrinus, <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> Milvus migrans lineatus, and humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} {{not found in}} the Indonesian {{archipelago}} between the South East Asian mainland and the Wallace Line. Vagrants, most likely of the <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite,</b> on occasion range far into the Pacific, out to the Hawaiian islands.|$|E
50|$|The {{best time}} to be here is the late {{afternoon}} after a fine, clear day. Then, the sun westering over Shing Mun, gaps between the trees show Kowloon Reservoir at its best. Mirror waters reach across to a turreted dam - the woodland shimmers with emerald greens - <b>black-eared</b> <b>kites</b> wheel overhead. As zephyrs fade, stillness gathers up the land.|$|R
50|$|<b>Black-eared</b> <b>kites</b> in Japan {{were found}} to {{accumulate}} nearly 70% of mercury accumulated from polluted food in the feathers, thus excreting it in the moult process. Black kites often perch on electric wires and are frequent victims of electrocution. Their habit of swooping to pick up dead rodents or other roadkill leads to collisions with vehicles. Instances of mass poisoning {{as a result of}} feeding on poisoned voles in agricultural fields have been noted. They are also a major nuisance at some airports, where their size makes them a significant birdstrike hazard.|$|R
40|$|<b>Black-eared</b> <b>kites</b> Milvus migrans lineatus were {{observed}} 122 times over 5 days foraging from Victoria Harbour and Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong. They {{were found to}} forage significantly more in Kowloon Bay and take flight paths parallel to the shore, though over the water, at lower altitudes. Their preferential foraging suggests that their food (refuse) may be clumped and not randomly distributed. We tentatively suggest that this species might help identify refuse hotspots in Hong Kong waterways, although we have not drawn a direct link between refuse distribution and kite foraging behavior...|$|R
50|$|The lake sustains a rich {{population}} of birds. Terrestrial birds observed {{around the lake}} include the <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite,</b> Eurasian sparrowhawk, short-toed eagle, Himalayan golden eagle, Himalayan monal, chukar partridge, koklass pheasant, rock dove, common cuckoo, alpine swift, Indian roller, Himalayan woodpecker, hoopoe, barn swallow, golden oriole and others.|$|E
50|$|The <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> is a {{migratory bird}} found in Asia and Australia. It is a scavenger, feeding on offal, carrion, refuse and dead {{fish in the}} harbour. Eagle's Nest, a well wooded ridge in the park, {{is one of the}} popular nesting areas near the harbour, {{probably}} {{because of the presence of}} tall pine trees.|$|E
50|$|The {{woods in}} the area are frequented by birds, and are {{especially}} a favourite of the <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> which can be seen flying around the two reservoirs. Other birds frequenting the area are the greater coucal, hwamei, magpie-robin, magpie, crested mynah and kingfisher. Occasionally visitors may also {{catch a glimpse of the}} pangolin or squirrel.|$|E
50|$|The park {{also provide}} habitat for forest animals found in few {{other parts of}} Hong Kong. Among these are {{protected}} species like the crested goshawk (Accipiter trivirgatus). Other birds found in the park include the <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> (Milvus migrans lineatus), house swift (Apus (affinis) nipalensis), greater coucal (Centropus s.sinensis), common kingfisher (Alcedo atthis), rufous-backed shrike (Lanius schach) and common tailorbird (Orthotomus sutorius).|$|E
50|$|The {{yellow-billed kite}} is {{apparently}} a separate species, {{as indicated by}} mtDNA phylogeny showing two supported clades, biogeography, and morphology. The <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> is somewhat distinct morphologically, but is better considered a well-marked parapatric subspecies. The status of the Cape Verde kite is in doubt; while not a completely monophyletic lineage according to mtDNA data, it is still best regarded as a distinct species. Whatever its status, this population is extinct.|$|E
50|$|Recent DNA {{studies suggest}} that the yellow-billed African races parasitus and aegyptius differ {{significantly}} from black kites in the Eurasian clade, and should be considered a separate allopatric species: yellow-billed kite, M. aegyptius. They occur throughout Africa except for the Congo basin and the Sahara Desert. There have been some suggestions that the <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> (M. m. lineatus) should be elevated to full species status as M. lineatus, but this is not well supported.|$|E
50|$|The {{species is}} found in Europe, Asia, Africa and Australia. The {{temperate}} populations of this kite tend to be migratory while the tropical ones are resident. European and central Asian birds (subspecies M. m. migrans and <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> M. m. lineatus, respectively) are migratory, moving to the tropics in winter, but races in warmer regions such as the Indian M. m. govinda (small Indian/pariah kite), or the Australasian M. m. affinis (fork-tailed kite), are resident. In some areas {{such as in the}} United Kingdom, the black kite occurs only as a wanderer on migration. These birds are usually of the nominate race, but in November 2006 a juvenile of the eastern lineatus, not previously recorded in western Europe, was found in Lincolnshire.|$|E
40|$|Food {{habits of}} the <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> Milvus migrans lineatus were {{analysed}} based on the stomach contents obtained from 241 kites, which were shot to reduce strike damage to aircraft or hit by aircraft at Nagasaki Airport, Nagasaki Prefecture, during the five-year period from 1977 to 1981. Most of the samples were collected in summer and autumn {{when the number of}} the kites was large. The kites fed mainly on fishes and insects in this period : especially in August and September, the former was their main diet. This fact was presumed {{to be related to the}} following two factors : 1) a mass death of fishes due to both an outbreak of a red tide and a lack of oxygen dissolved in bottom waters, and 2) abandonment of a quantity of worthless fishes, which thronged into well-conditioned environments owing to deterioration in water quality and consequently became easily captured by fishermen. In October and November the kite chiefly preyed on locusts. During this period, a large number of them inhabited green belts in the airport; thus the kite seemed to eat preferentially locusts which were easy to catch. It was concluded that the <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite</b> fed on prey animals obtained easily according to habitats and/or seasons...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of homeothermy {{was investigated in}} a hand-reared <b>black-eared</b> <b>kite,</b> Milvus migrans lineatus. The 20 -day-old nestling was capable of thermoregulating at about 95 % of the adult ability at the ambient temperature of 20 ℃. In effect, the kite {{which is one of}} large altricial birds acquires the homeothermy in an earlier growth stage than do small altricial ones, Such precocious {{development of}} homeothermy in the kite appears to be caused by the large body mass resulting in decreased surface to volume ratio and in increased heat production, and it allows the parents to increase the foraging time early in the nestling period. In other words, the precocious development of homeothermy plays an important part in the growth and survival of the kite nestling which requires more food and energy than do the nestlings of small altricial birds...|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} we {{describe}} our data on observations of birds of prey in Eastern-Kazakhstan Upland and Northern Balkhash Lake area collected mostly in 2013, May–June and September, and also in 2012, March and May. In total we have recorded 15 species of birds of prey: Steppe Eagle (Aquila nipalensis), Golden Eagle (Aquila chrysaetos), Imperial Eagle (Aquila heliaca), Booted Eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus), Short-Toed Eagle (Circaetus gallicus), Long-Legged Buzzard (Buteo rufinus), <b>Black-Eared</b> <b>Kite</b> (Milvus migrans lineatus), Pallid Harrier (Circus macrourus), Montagu’s Harrier (Circus pygargus), Western Marsh Harrier (Circus aeruginosus), Eurasian Sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), Saker Falcon (Falco cherrug), Steppe Merlin (Falco columbarius pallidus), Lesser and Common Kestrels (Falco naumanni, F. tinnunculus), and also 4 owl species: Eurasian Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo), Short-Eared Owl (Asio flammeus), Little Owl (Athene noctua), and Scops Owl (Otus scops). Nesting peculiarities (data on nests' locations and breeding) are described for some species...|$|E
40|$|Winter raptor {{migration}} and movement is poorly documented for peninsular India, mainly {{due to the}} lack of geographical bottlenecks. We describe, for the first time, the use of a garbage dump in a metropolitan city as an alternative visual winter raptor monitoring station. The daily count, adult to juvenile ratios and species composition of three migratory raptor species, Steppe Eagle Aquila nipalensis, <b>Black-eared</b> <b>Kite</b> Milvus migrans lineatus and Tawny Eagle Aquila rapax are presented. Ground temperatures at the garbage dump site and surrounding area, and the wing beat rate of migratory raptors before and after arrival in the early morning were measured. A total of 355 raptors migrating over a period of six observation days with 250 adults and 105 juveniles were recorded. The temperature of the garbage dump was significantly higher than the surrounding area, while the wing flapping rate was significantly lower over the garbage dump area. It is possible that migrating raptors use garbage dump thermals in the early morning to save energy with soaring and gliding flight (versus flapping flight). We propose that such sites may be used as visual winter migration monitoring stations in metropolitan cities in peninsular India...|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the avifauna {{in and around}} the Nagasaki Airport, and investigated the behavior and food habits of the <b>Black-eared</b> <b>Kite,</b> Milvus migrans, which roosted in Usu-jima Islet near the airport from June, 1977 to March, 1979. The results obtained are as follows: 1. Sixty-two bird species belonging to twenty-six families were observed {{in and around the}} airport. In the course of census, we found wintering of the American Golden Plover Pluvialis dominica from 1977 to 1978, and the Chinese Great-grey Shrike Lanius sphenocercus on January 10, 1978 which had been rarely observed in Kyushu, Japan. In the airport the dominant species were always the Skylark, Alauda arvensis, and the Tree Sparrow, Passer montanus. 2. The Black-eared Kites left the roost in Usu-jima early in the morning, and flew to the feeding area, but some kites remained on and around Usu-jima all day long. The maximum number of kites is highest between September and November, and they decreased markedly in December; they increased again from January to February, but only a few individuals were observed between March and July. These changes in abundance of kites probably reflect their migratory movements. 3. Between September and October many kites moved in a wide area, but less so in other months. Especially in December, all kites lived within a very restricted area. Accordingly, the extension and reduction of the daily movement seem to relate to the feeding area, which changes with fluctuations in kite 2 ̆ 7 s abundance. We found another roost in Osaki Peninsula, north to the Nagasaki Airport, and there seemed to be other two roosts. The kites roosting here seemed not to move so far. Since there is abundant food for the kites along the coast, it seems enough for their existence to feed within a narrow area. 4. Fishes were most abundant as food items of the Black-eared Kites and a kind of gobies, Chaeturichthys hexanema, occupied the highest percentage of them, being followed by insects. Especially in October, a number of kites gathered at the airport in order to feed on locusts which inhabited the grassland, so that the ratio of kites with stomachs including insects temporarily increased. Other foods detected were the kite (probably fed after death), skylark and a kind of pill-bugs, Armadillidium vulgare. 1. 1977 年 6 月から 2 ̆ 779 年 3 月まで,長崎空港周辺の鳥相および臼島を塒とするトビの行動と食性について調べた. 2. 長崎空港周辺で確認された鳥種は 26 科 62 種に達したが,特筆すべきこととしてムナグロの越冬(1977 年から 2 ̆ 778 年にかけての冬) とオオカラモズの確認(1978 年 1 月 10 日) を挙げた. 空港内ではヒバリとスズメが常に優占種であつた. 3,トビは朝早く臼島の塒から飛び立ちえさ場へ向かうが,同島やその周辺で終日生活する個体も多く確認された. 月別に見た 1 日のうちのトビの最大個体数は 9 月～ 11 月に多く, 12 月になると激減し, 1, 2 月には再び増加し, 3 月以降 7 月まで少なかつた. その原因としては渡りが考えられた. 4. 個体数の最も多い 9, 10 月には直線距離にして最大 10 km程度の飛翔を行なつて広範囲に行動する個体が増加するが,それ以外の月にはそれほど遠くへ出て行く個体は見られず,特に 12 月にはすべての個体は 1 ～ 2 kmの範囲内で生活していることが知られた. 従つて,これら行動範囲の拡張と縮小は個体数の増減に対応したえさ場の確保と関係があると考えられた. 車によるライン・センサスの結果,臼島のほかに確実に 1 ヵ所,また明示はできないが更に 2 ヵ所の塒があると推察されたが,それらの塒の個体もさほど遠距離まで行動しないと思われた. 恐らく,海岸沿いには常に餌が豊富に存在し,ある程度までの個体数は塒の近距離内で許容されるためと考えられた. 5. トビの食物としては魚類が最も多く,その中でもアカハゼが主食となつていることが知られた. 次いで昆虫類が多く,特に 10 月には空港の草原に生息するバッタ類を採食しに飛来するトビが増加し,昆虫を採食している個体の割合が一時的に増大した. そのほかの食物としては鳥類のトビとヒバリ,甲殻類のダンゴムシが確認された...|$|E
