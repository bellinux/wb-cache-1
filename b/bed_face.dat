25|$|The two men {{returned}} to Bradley's flat, where Ireland {{suggested that he}} tie Bradley up; Bradley expressed his displeasure at the idea. In order to get Bradley to comply, Ireland {{told him that he}} was unable to perform sexually without elements of bondage. Bradley hesitantly cooperated and was soon trussed up on his own <b>bed,</b> <b>face</b> down, with a noose around his neck. After Ireland had secured Bradley, he demanded money and a PIN number under the threat of torture. Ireland assured Bradley that he was merely a thief and would leave after stealing Bradley's money. After Bradley gave Ireland his PIN, which Ireland later used to steal £200, along with £100 in cash stolen from Bradley's flat, Ireland told him that he should go to sleep, as he wouldn't be leaving his flat for hours. Bradley eventually did fall asleep and Ireland momentarily thought of leaving Bradley unharmed. Ireland then realised that Bradley could identify him and used the noose, which he had earlier attached around Bradley's neck, to strangle him. Before leaving Bradley's flat, he placed a doll on top of the dead man's body.|$|E
6000|$|But Donald Farfrae admired her, too; and {{altogether}} {{the time}} was an exciting one; sex had never before asserted itself in her so strongly, for in former days she had perhaps been too impersonally human to be distinctively feminine. After an unprecedented success one day she came indoors, went upstairs, and leant upon her <b>bed</b> <b>face</b> downwards quite forgetting the possible creasing and damage. [...] "Good Heaven," [...] she whispered, [...] "can it be? Here am I setting up as the town beauty!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was dark}} when supper was ready, and {{still no sign}} of Anne, coming hurriedly over the log bridge or up Lover's Lane, breathless and repentant with a sense of {{neglected}} duties. Marilla washed and put away the dishes grimly. Then, wanting a candle to light her way down the cellar, she went up to the east gable for the one that generally stood on Anne's table. Lighting it, she turned around to see Anne herself lying on the <b>bed,</b> <b>face</b> downward among the pillows.|$|E

60|$|Timothy was {{propped up}} in bed, {{with his hands}} joined before his chest, and {{his eyes fixed on}} the ceiling, where a fly was {{standing}} upside down. Soames stood {{at the foot of the}} <b>bed,</b> <b>facing</b> him.|$|R
60|$|He {{felt like}} a court in which some {{overwhelmingly}} revolutionary piece of evidence had been tendered. All the elaborate defence had broken down at one blow. He sat up {{on the edge of}} his <b>bed,</b> <b>facing</b> the new fact.|$|R
60|$|He {{received}} me {{with absolute}} enthusiasm. He was too rheumatic to be shaken hands with, but he begged me {{to shake the}} tassel {{on the top of}} his nightcap, which I did most cordially. When I sat down by the side of the bed, he said that it did him a world of good to feel as if he was driving me on the Blunderstone road again. As he lay in <b>bed,</b> <b>face</b> upward, and so covered, with that exception, that he seemed to be nothing but a face--like a conventional cherubim--he looked the queerest object I ever beheld.|$|E
6000|$|She got up, {{and before}} he could stop her, was gone. With {{the closing of the}} door, his anger evaporated, and {{distress}} took its place. Poor child! What to do with this wayward chicken just out of the egg, and wanting to be full-fledged at once? The thought that she would be lying miserable, crying, perhaps, beset him so that he went out into the passage and tapped on her door. Getting no answer, he went in. It was dark but for a streak of moonlight, and in that he saw her, lying on her <b>bed,</b> <b>face</b> down; and stealing up laid his hand on her head. She did not move; and, stroking her hair, he said gently: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, that is {{the strange}} thing. When I left her last night she was--she was lying across the <b>bed,</b> <b>face</b> downward. I had just told her that I was going away and that I wanted her to go with me. She refused {{to do this and}} tried to get The Voices to speak to her. They would not come, and so she, being hurt, I suppose, by what I said, ran into the room and flung herself down on the bed, weeping. I was angry at her and did not speak to her again. I went to sleep out here on the couch, and did not see her again till morning. When I looked in at eight o'clock she was lying just as she is now." ...|$|E
60|$|When Eunice {{had placed}} the candle {{on the shelf}} and drawn down the ugly blue paper blinds, {{shutting}} out the strips of violet sky where a score of glimmering points were now visible, {{she sat down on}} the foot of the <b>bed,</b> <b>facing</b> her mother.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a detailed mapping {{of the class}} II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding site using site-directed mutagenesis in conjunction with high-resolution CD 4 structural data. Residues on all lateral surfaces of domain 1 and the neighboring portions of domain 2 participate in contacting class II MHC. Thus, {{in addition to the}} C'C" ridge that forms the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 gp 120 binding site, apparent MHC contacts extend over the <b>BED</b> <b>face</b> of domain 1 and across the interdomain groove onto the FG loop of domain 2. Several models of the CD 4 /class II MHC interaction accounting for the extent of the CD 4 surface involved are discussed, including the possibility that CD 4 may contact more than one class II MHC molecule using different surfaces...|$|E

50|$|This routine did {{not alter}} {{from one day}} to the next - up at 6am and return to their cells at 7pm.Hourly checks were made on the girls at night, causing sleep deprivation, and they were {{required}} to lie in their <b>beds</b> <b>facing</b> the door. No education or schooling was provided and girls who resisted, or who showed any form of attitude, were locked in isolation, placed on a restricted diet and had their sentences extended.|$|R
40|$|Soil-cement blocks {{are used}} for the load bearing masonry of 2 – 3 -story buildings. Flexural and shear {{strength}} of such walls greatly depend upon the bond strength between the block and the mortar. This paper deals with the methods of improving the shear-bond strength of soil-cement block masonry without altering the mortar characteristics {{and the influence of}} shear-bond strength on masonry compressive strength. Altering the texture of bed faces of the block, size and area of the frog, and certain surface coatings have been attempted to enhance the shear-bond strength. The results indicate that: (1) rough textured <b>bed</b> <b>face</b> of the blocks yields higher shear-bond strength than the plain surface; (2) use of fresh cement-slurry coating on the bed faces improves the shear-bond strength considerably; (3) no significant changes are noticed in the compressive strength and stress-strain characteristics of soil-cement block masonry due to changes in shear-bond strength; and (4) masonry has a higher straining capacity than that of the block and the mortar...|$|E

25|$|The present garden {{follows a}} layout {{established}} by Mellon. Each flower bed is planted {{with a series}} of Littleleaf lindens and Kennedy saucer magnolias bordered by low hedges of boxwood and American Holly. The outer edge of the flower <b>bed</b> <b>facing</b> the central lawn are edged with boxwood. Perennial flowering plants include delphinium, hollyhock, lavender, and roses. Many seasonal flowers are interspersed to add nearly year round color. Spring blooming bulbs planted in the rose garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and squill. Summer blooming annuals change yearly. In the fall chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color until early winter.|$|R

40|$|This {{project was}} to reduce readmissions for {{patients}} who are discharged to home. This is an organizational project for the University Medical Center at Princeton, which is an acute facility in Plainsboro, NJ with 319 licensed <b>beds.</b> <b>Faced</b> with pay for performance program payment reductions, a multidisciplinary steering committee was formed to develop a readmission reduction program. Through the use of evidence based guidelines and tools, the committee has base-lined the organization maturity in its readmission reduction efforts, and found opportunities for improvement related to the identification of at-risk patients, medication reconciliation, post-discharge follow-up calls and {{end of life care}} planning. Focus groups have been formed to address these findings, and are early in the action plan phase of the program. Presentation: 45 : 4...|$|R
5000|$|The new '30 Suzuki Carry (the [...] "Suzulight" [...] label {{was being}} retired) {{was a full}} cab-over design, with the same FB engine mounted {{horizontally}} underneath the load area. The starter and generator were combined and mounted directly {{on the front of}} the crankshaft. Introduced in February 1966, the L30 was built alongside its more traditional predecessor until they were both replaced by the L40. A canopied L30H, similar to the L20H but with the seats in the <b>bed</b> <b>facing</b> each other, was available right from the start. There was also an L31, with a drop-side bed. Performance and mechanics were very similar to its bonneted sister, but the load area was considerably larger. Maximum load capacity was still 350 kg.|$|R

40|$|In Japan, many {{hospitals}} with under 200 licensed <b>beds</b> <b>face</b> {{a variety of}} problems. Most of them {{are related to the}} quality of nursing. Last time, to investigate nurses' educational conditions in hospitals and to find the key to improvement, a nursing quality improvement committee, including Osaka Prefectural Office staff, sent out questionnaires to nurses in hospitals in Osaka. But there were a small number of answers from nurses who worked in hospitals with under 200 licensed beds. Then, {{to find out how to}} revitalize these nurses by educational systems, we conducted a focus group interview for 10 nurses. The results indicate that the quality of continuing education systems is not effective, with the result that nursing staffs face low motivation for improvement and a nurse shortage as well...|$|R
