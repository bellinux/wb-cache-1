It was reported that Chung, under contract with Emperor Entertainment Group in 2008, did not receive any salary {{for the duration of}} the scandal, and even struggled to pay rent.|$|E

2500|$|When {{television}} came to Australia in 1956, many radio figures {{sought and}} achieved {{employment in the}} new medium. Pearce was no exception, moving to HSV Channel 7 in Melbourne working as a newsreader and quiz show host. Pearce provided the first TV news report for that channel on 4 November 1956. The Argus reviewer F. Keith Manzie described Melbourne's first TV broadcast [...] "I liked Eric Pearce as a compere. His easy-mannered, genial personality came right through the viewing screen in the quiz show, I've Got a Secret ... reading of the news was illustrated with appropriate newsreel shots". In 1956 he was also co-host of the series Eric and Mary, and in 1957 he was host of <b>Be</b> <b>My</b> <b>Guest.</b> Pearce resigned from HSV-7 in the late 1950s. He believed that newsreaders required credibility and that doing anything other than news for a job was ill-advised. When GTV Channel 9 offered him employment as chief news reader without him having to do any other shows, he took it. In 1961, he appeared in Let Me Read to You, {{in which he would}} read from popular works.|$|E
60|$|TARLETON. Well, is she? A woman I {{bring into}} <b>my</b> house <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest.</b> A woman you bring into <b>my</b> house <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest.</b> But {{a woman who}} drops bang {{down out of the}} sky into my {{greenhouse}} and smashes every blessed pane of glass in it must take her chance.|$|R
6000|$|... "No {{one will}} hurt you. There are no Danes here. You <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> <b>my</b> friend, my brother. Look up! here <b>is</b> <b>my</b> own Fru Astrida." ...|$|R
6000|$|It evidently <b>was.</b> <b>My</b> <b>guests</b> <b>were</b> all rising with difficulty. The {{floor of}} the veranda was covered with some glutinous substance. It was--sirup! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{he shall}} <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> here in Tulagi, until he changes {{his mind and}} heart, and does pay, and listens to an entire course of lectures." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young man," [...] {{said the}} King, [...] "you are welcome, whoever you may be. Do me the favor to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> {{as long as}} you remain in my capital." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It waxes late," [...] said Lord de Clarenham, rising; [...] "bring out the horses, Miles; and you, {{my young}} kinsman, Arthur, {{you are to}} <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> from henceforth. Come, therefore, prepare for the journey." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, {{that is all}} right, Miss Smithers," [...] {{said the}} captain, with a jolly laugh. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> and I shall take no denial." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Porter and {{his friends}} <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guests,</b> Mr. Merwell. When you insult them, you insult me." [...] And Belle held her head high in the air.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so, not so," [...] he answered, [...] "you <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> to-night. Also, fear not, Hernan will be away. He {{has gone}} a journey upon some business." ...|$|R
6000|$|Torrance smiled drily. [...] "Then {{if you are}} not {{too proud}} to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> to-night, I should be glad of your company and will find you a horse to take you back to Fremont when it suits you." ...|$|E
6000|$|This threat threw Simeon into a panic. [...] "Of {{course you}} will remain private. You will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> {{the same as}} your mother. No one but my own family shall know of your {{wonderful}} powers. I will see to that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hush!' said Fakredeen, {{with an air}} of real or {{affected}} alarm. 'He {{is going}} to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> at my principal castle. What do you mean by captive? You mean whom I have saved from captivity, or am about to save? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't see {{anything}} ridiculous in it. A physician need not charge anything unless he chooses, or she; and if I choose to make Louise <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> here it's {{quite the same}} as if she <b>were</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gunrig," [...] {{said the}} king, drawing himself up, and {{speaking}} impressively, [...] "remember that you <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> {{and that it}} ill becomes you to insult my women before my face." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The sheriff {{is present}} and {{can speak for}} himself. He <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> last night and made an {{agreement}} with me, which, as an honorable man, he is disposed to keep." ...|$|R
60|$|We voted {{that the}} old man should bunk with us, and <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> and Hillyer's. I shall keep my own counsel, naturally; but as soon as he is well rested and nourished, I shall take him to Denver and {{rehabilitate}} his fortunes.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I am {{condemned}} to do this, for neither I {{nor any of}} my kindred can die till I have rooted up this great tree,' replied {{the king of the}} eagles. 'But it is now evening, and I need work no more to-day. Come to my house with me, and <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> for the night.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Let us be friends," [...] he said. [...] "You shall <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> at Blentz {{for a long}} time. I {{doubt if}} Peter will care to release you soon, for he has no love for your father--and {{it will be easier}} for both if we {{establish}} pleasant relations from the beginning. What do you say?" ...|$|E
60|$|STEPHEN: (With {{elaborate}} gestures, breathing {{deeply and}} slowly) You <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guests.</b> Uninvited. By {{virtue of the}} fifth of George and seventh of Edward. History to blame. Fabled by mothers of memory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Lay platters for me {{and these}} two young gentlemen," [...] said the Augustinian. [...] "Ye <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guests,</b> ye wot," [...] he added, [...] "since ye tarried not for meat at Hyde." ...|$|R
6000|$|Stoller {{asserted}} {{himself to}} say: [...] "That's all right, then. I {{want you to}} <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guests,</b> and I'll see about the carriages." [...] He turned to Burnamy: [...] "Will you order them?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We," [...] {{corrected}} Psmith. [...] "I {{will explain}} all {{at a little}} luncheon at which I trust that you will <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest.</b> Already, such is the stress of this journalistic life, I hear my tissues crying out imperatively to be restored. An oyster {{and a glass of}} milk somewhere round the corner, Comrade Jackson? I think so, I think so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I saw {{you come}} in, {{but the work}} was pressing, and I could not stop to speak to you. To-day you must <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> and I will show you {{something}} {{of the way in}} which I live. Wait here for a moment, while I lay aside these dirty clothes.' With these words he unlocked a door in the cave, and bade Hans pass in before him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am glad to}} hear it," [...] resumed Touchwood; [...] "you shall <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> and I {{will make}} them look after you in proper fashion--You {{seem to be a}} very civil sort of fellow, and I do not find your arm inconvenient--it is the {{rheumatism}} makes me walk so ill--the pest of all that have been in hot climates when they settle among these d--d fogs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} quite understand, Sir Percy, that you <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> here to-night," [...] Chauvelin had said suavely, [...] "and {{that you are}} free to come and go, just as you please." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because I forbid you. They <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guests,</b> {{and must}} <b>be</b> {{protected}} and well treated. And {{even if this}} were not so, the larks {{are too small to}} satisfy your hunger, you little gluttons." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maria, my dear," [...] he said, with a deferential urbanity, [...] "Mr. Allen <b>is</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> and {{a gentleman}}. When a gentleman gives his {{word that he}} is not a criminal, it is sufficient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What matters?" [...] {{she said}} gently. [...] "You have progressed {{so well in}} your work that you can finish it elsewhere. I have no great desire to stay in France with a {{frontier}} garrisoned by troops while I have a villa in Switzerland where you could still <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest.</b> Paris can teach you nothing more, my friend; you have only to create now--and be famous." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will go {{home with}} you, if you like," [...] pursued the minister, though his mind misgave him {{that this was an}} extreme which Mrs. Sewell would not have {{justified}} him in. [...] "I will go with you, and explain all the circumstances to your friends, in case there should be any misunderstanding--though in that event I should have to ask you to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> till Monday." [...] Here the unhappy man laid hold of the sheep, which could not bring him greater condemnation than the lamb.|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{effort of}} mine to {{be worthy of}} that sacred trust was left untried. How could I hope to succeed where she had failed? My house in London and my house in the country were both open to Beaucourt; I entreated him to live with me, or (if he {{preferred}} it) to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> {{for a short time}} only, or (if he wished to be alone) to choose the place of abode which he liked best for his solitary retreat. With sincere expressions of gratitude, his inflexible despair refused my proposals.|$|E
60|$|The hour of dejeuner has arrived. I entreat them to <b>be</b> <b>my</b> <b>guests.</b> I can run to it, you understand, {{for there}} <b>are</b> still in <b>my</b> pockets plenty of my uncle's francs. They consent. I am in 'eaven.|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>was</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest,</b> it <b>is</b> true, {{but none}} the less, {{he was a}} {{stranger}} to me," [...] Wolfenden explained. [...] "He brought a letter from my cousin, {{who seems to have}} considered him a decent sort of fellow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is nothing," [...] Alvarez {{replied in}} a deprecatory tone. [...] "You <b>are</b> <b>my</b> <b>guest</b> {{and we try}} to take care of foreigners, because if they meet with {{accidents}} their consuls ask embarrassing questions. Besides, watching them serves two objects." ...|$|R
