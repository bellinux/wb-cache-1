5|$|Jones {{returns to}} his {{teaching}} position at a New England college, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant – the Nazis <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra {{is the key to}} finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried.|$|E
5|$|The next season, Bradman made an {{abortive}} bid to {{join the}} Victoria state side. The Melbourne Cricket Club advertised the position of club secretary and he was led to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> he applied, he would get the job. The position, which had been held by Hugh Trumble {{until his death in}} August 1938, {{was one of the most}} prestigious jobs in Australian cricket. The annual salary of £1,000 would make Bradman financially secure while allowing him to retain a connection with the game. On 18 January 1939, the club's committee, on the casting vote of the chairman, chose former Test batsman Vernon Ransford over Bradman.|$|E
25|$|As stated above, apraxia {{should not}} be {{confused}} with aphasia; however, they frequently occur together.

Sportswriters <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> McKinney - who was assigned to guard Kurland - could play well enough defense and Dillon make enough shots, the Tar Heels would have a chance at winning.|$|R
25|$|The Ojibwe crafted the dreamcatcher.

25|$|If {{there had}} been no Ashes and £1,000 a man for winning today's game, I daresay {{there would have been a}} result. the fact that these matches are played in a series is a damper. The fact that the Ashes must be fought for is a further damper. I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a series is drawn, then the Ashes should at least go into pawn so that no one holds them.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Talmudic rabbis are divided between those who seek {{the purpose of the}} mitzvot {{and those who do not}} question them. The latter argue that if the reason for each mitzvah could be determined, people might try to achieve what they see as the purpose of the mitzvah, without actually performing the mitzvah itself (lishmah), which would become self-defeating. The former <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> people were to understand the reason and the purpose for each mitzvah, it would actually help them to observe and perform the mitzvah (some mitzvot are given reasons in the Torah).|$|E

25|$|Gender {{roles in}} {{traditional}} Bezanozano families are strictly defined. Men are the {{active participants in}} discussions about public affairs, and are responsible for house construction, earning {{money to pay for}} basic family needs, and preparing the paddy fields for planting. Women are responsible for weaving, tending crops, collecting water, tending the hearth and preparing meals. Similarly, women were traditionally expected to follow behind when walking with a man. Bezanozano men working as porters used to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> a woman passed in front of him while he worked, he would be injured the next time he attempted to carry a load.|$|E
25|$|Judging {{others by}} themselves, the English, who are blinded by their loyalty, have {{always thought that}} the Germans did not abide by their pledges inscribed in the Versailles Treaty because they had not frankly agreed to them...We, on the contrary, <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Germany, far from making the {{slightest}} effort {{to carry out the}} treaty of peace, has always tried to escape her obligations, it is because until now she has not been convinced of her defeat...We are also certain that Germany, as a nation, resigns herself to keep her pledged word only under the impact of necessity.|$|E
25|$|In March 2008, the {{government}} approved Resolution 24/2008, which {{created a new}} natural gas market called “Gas Plus” to encourage private investment in natural gas exploration and production. The Gas Plus regime applies to new discoveries and to “tight gas” fields. The price of the new gas, whose commercialization will be restricted to the domestic market, will {{not be subject to}} the conditions established in the “Agreement with Natural Gas Producers 2007-2011” but will be based on costs and a reasonable profit. Experts <b>believe</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> the Gas Plus regime is successful, it could stimulate new investments in electricity generation plants under the Energy Plus regime as it could ensure fuel supply to the new plants.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{precedent}} {{set by the}} Treaty of Punakha, on August 8, 1949, Thimphu signed the Treaty of Friendship Between the Government of India and the Government of Bhutan, according to which external affairs, formerly guided by Britain, were to be guided by India. Like Britain, India agreed not to interfere in Bhutan's internal affairs. India also agreed to increase the annual subsidy to 500,000 rupees per year. Important to Bhutan's national pride was the return of Dewangiri. Some historians <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> India had been at odds with China at this time, {{as it was to}} be a decade later, it might not have acceded so easily to Bhutan's request for independent status.|$|E
25|$|While honeymooning in Africa, Ellen Rimbauer {{fell ill}} (from an {{unspecified}} {{sexually transmitted disease}} given to her by her unfaithful husband) and made the acquaintance of Sukeena, a local tribeswoman. The two women became very close while Sukeena nursed Ellen back to health, and Sukeena accompanied the Rimbauers back to the newly completed Rose Red to work there full-time as a servant. The Rimbauers soon had two children, Adam and April (born with a withered arm), but Ellen quickly became unhappy with her marriage to her philandering and neglectful, misogynistic husband. After a spiritualist seance, Ellen came to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> she continued to build and expand the house, she would never die (echoing {{the story of the}} Winchester Mystery House).|$|E
25|$|In {{his review}} (collected in The Present as History, 1953) Marxist Paul Sweezy joked that Hayek {{would have you}} <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> there was an {{over-production}} of baby carriages, the central planners would then order the population to have more babies instead of simply warehousing the temporary excess of carriages and decreasing production for next year. The cybernetic arguments of Stafford Beer in his 1974 CBC Massey Lectures, Designing Freedom – that intelligent adaptive planning can increase freedom – are {{of interest in this}} regard, as is the technical work of Herbert A. Simon and Albert Ando on the dynamics of hierarchical nearly decomposable systems in economics – namely, that everything in such a system is not tightly coupled to everything else.|$|E

25|$|Apparently {{dizzy and}} disoriented, Tunney grabbed {{on to the}} ring's top rope with his left hand. Dempsey, who used to stand over opponents and rush right back at them after they got up, looked down on Tunney. Referee Dave Barry ordered Dempsey into a neutral corner to no avail; Dempsey just stood there, observing his opponent. This gave Tunney {{precious}} seconds to recuperate. By the time Dempsey finally walked to a neutral corner, Tunney had been down for around 3 to 8 seconds. Barry could not start to count on Tunney until Dempsey reached the neutral corner, {{but he was still}} able to count to nine before Tunney got up. Some <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> Dempsey had responded to the referee's orders in time, he would have likely regained the world Heavyweight crown with a seventh round knockout of Tunney. The validity of this argument has been debated even to this day. In the fight film, a clock was superimposed that recorded Tunney's time on the floor as 13 seconds, from the moment he fell until he got up. Because of this delay, it became known as The Long Count Fight.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the growing concerns about human health risks from pharmaceutical drugs via environmental exposures, many researchers have speculated {{about the potential for}} inducing an antibiotic resistance. One study found 10 different antibiotics in sewage treatment effluents, surface water, and sediments. Some microbiologists <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> antibiotic concentrations are higher than the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of a species of pathogenic bacteria, a selective pressure would be exerted and, as a result, antibiotic resistance would be selectively promoted. It has also been proven that at even sub-inhibitory concentrations (e.g., one-fourth of the MIC), several antibiotics are able to have an effect on gene expression (e.g., as shown for the modulation of expression of toxin-encoding genes in Staphylococcus aureus). For reference the MIC of erythromycin that is effective against 90 percent of lab grown Campylobacter bacteria, the most common food-borne pathogen in the United States, is 60ng/mL. One study found that the average concentration of erythromycin, a commonly prescribed antibiotic, was 0.09ng/mL in water treatment plant effluents,. Additionally, transfer of genetic elements among bacteria has been observed under natural conditions in wastewater treatment plants, and selection of resistant bacteria has been documented in sewers receiving wastewaters from pharmaceutical plants. Moreover, antibiotic resistant bacteria may also remain in sewage sludge and enter the food chain if the sludge is not incinerated but used as fertilizer on agricultural land.|$|E

500|$|Shortly thereafter, Information Minister Ahmad Shabery Cheek {{insisted that}} ketuanan Melayu did not imply a {{master-slave}} relationship {{in any sense}} between the Malays and non-Malays. Instead, he suggested, it referred to {{the institution of the}} Malay monarchs, who had once been the [...] "masters", but gave up their primacy when the Federal Constitution was adopted at independence. Shabery cited Article 182 of the Constitution, which grants the royalty certain legal immunities, as an example of Malay supremacy. However, some prominent members of the royalty such as the Raja of Perlis and former Yang di-Pertuan Agong Tuanku Syed Sirajuddin Putra Syed Jamalullail have themselves been critical of ketuanan Melayu; in early 2009, the Raja stated that [...] "In Malaysia, every race is tuan ...
