This is exemplified on benchmark systems, trimetallo-dodecacarbonyls M- 3 (CO) (12) with M = Ru, Os, where the energy remaining in the molecule after photoionization can be retrieved by measuring the degree of fragmentation of the molecular ion. The intensity of different mass peaks can thus be directly related to ionization cross sections obtained by photoelectron spectroscopy. We find that the M-CO dissociation energy rises as the number of CO ligands decreases due to dissociation. Moreover, ionization of the CO ligands has a higher cross section than that of the metal center for both single and double ionization. After advanced fragmentation, a CO bond can break and the carbon atom remains <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metal <b>core.</b> In addition, we found that the valence ionization cross sections of M- 3 (CO) (12) are maximal at about 40 eV photon energy thus showing a more pronounced shape resonance than Ru and Os-complexes with a single metal atom center.

MethodsNominally identical Vita VM 9 veneer-ceramic disc-shaped specimens (0. 7 mm thickness, 12 mm diameter) were fabricated. 20 specimens received a surface coating of resin-cement (Panavia 21); 20 specimens were <b>bonded</b> with <b>the</b> resin-cement <b>to</b> fully sintered Y-TZP (YZ Vita Inceram Vita) discs (0. 27 mm thickness, 12 mm diameter). A final series of 20 Y-TZP core/veneer-ceramic specimens were manufactured using a conventional sintering route. Biaxial flexure strength was determined in a ball-on-ring configuration and stress at the fracture origin calculated using multilayer closed-form analytical solutions. Fractography was undertaken using scanning electron microscopy. The experimental test was simulated using Finite Element Analysis. Group mean BFS were compared using a one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey tests at a 95 % significance level. ResultsResin cement application resulted in significant strengthening of the veneer-ceramic and further significant strengthening of the veneer-ceramic (p< 0. 01) occurred following <b>bonding</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Y-TZP <b>core.</b> <b>The</b> BFS calculated at the failure origin for conventionally sintered specimens was significantly reduced {{when compared with the}} adhesively bonded Y-TZP/veneer-ceramic.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work is to develop an analytical tool to predict failure loads of separable insert joints of sandwich structures. Insert connections provide several <b>bonding</b> interfaces <b>to</b> <b>the</b> honeycomb <b>core</b> as well as <b>to</b> <b>the</b> skin sheets, varying in number, position and size depending on the insert type. <b>The</b> idea is <b>to</b> improve these load paths on their quantity, quality and transferring load portions. With this paper {{the current status of}} this investigation is provided. Through-the-thickness insert connections are selected for experimental benchmark testing due to their high load-to-weight ratio. The first failure mode under transversal loads is shear buckling of <b>the</b> honeycomb <b>core</b> cell walls. This failure type is evaluated by a convenient applicable, semi-analytical equation, recommended by ECSS [1]. This formula is based on the “simple sandwich theory”, considering <b>the</b> design parameters <b>core</b> and skin sheet thickness, core shear strength, honeycomb cell size and insert radius in linear dependence. In contrast, the face sheet flexure stiffness as well as core density is not considered within the analytic equation, though their influence is not negligible. If significant tendencies of these non-considered parameters are deductible, the analytical approach could be extended. Therefore, analytical predictions are compared to benchmark test data taken from several sources. The analytical predictions show sufficient correspondence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> test data results, confirming the assumption of a linear dependency of the considered design parameters...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} on particle size distributions and particle concentrations near a busy road cannot {{be explained by}} the conventional mechanisms for particle evolution of combustion aerosols. Specifically they appear to be inadequate <b>to</b> explain <b>the</b> experimental observations of particle transformation and the evolution of the total number concentration. This resulted {{in the development of a}} new mechanism based on their thermal fragmentation, for the evolution of combustion aerosol nano-particles. A complex and comprehensive pattern of evolution of combustion aerosols, involving particle fragmentation, was then proposed and justified. In that model it was suggested that thermal fragmentation occurs in aggregates of primary particles each of which contains a solid graphite/carbon core surrounded by volatile molecules <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>core</b> by strong covalent <b>bonds.</b> Due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presence of strong covalent bonds between <b>the</b> <b>core</b> and <b>the</b> volatile (frill) molecules, such primary composite particles can be regarded as solid, despite the presence of significant (possibly, dominant) volatile component. Fragmentation occurs when weak van der Waals forces between such primary particles are overcome by their thermal (Brownian) motion. In this work, the accepted concept of thermal fragmentation is advanced to determine whether fragmentation is likely in liquid composite nano-particles. It has been demonstrated that at least at some stages of evolution, combustion aerosols contain a large number of composite liquid particles containing presumably several components such as water, oil, volatile compounds, and minerals. It is possible that such composite liquid particles may also experience thermal fragmentation and thus contribute <b>to,</b> for example, <b>the</b> evolution of the total number concentration as a function of distance from the source. Therefore, the aim of this project is <b>to</b> examine theoretically <b>the</b> possibility of thermal fragmentation of composite liquid nano-particles consisting of immiscible liquid v components. The specific focus is on ternary systems which include two immiscible liquid droplets surrounded by another medium (e. g., air). The analysis shows that three different structures are possible, the complete encapsulation of one liquid by the other, partial encapsulation of the two liquids in a composite particle, and the two droplets separated from each other. The probability of thermal fragmentation of two coagulated liquid droplets is discussed and examined for different volumes of the immiscible fluids in a composite liquid particle and their surface and interfacial tensions through the determination of the Gibbs free energy difference between the coagulated and fragmented states, and comparison of this energy difference with the typical thermal energy kT. The analysis reveals that fragmentation was found to be much more likely for a partially encapsulated particle than a completely encapsulated particle. In particular, it was found that thermal fragmentation was much more likely when the volume ratio of the two liquid droplets that constitute the composite particle are very different. Conversely, when the two liquid droplets are of similar volumes, the probability of thermal fragmentation is small. It is also demonstrated that the Gibbs free energy difference between the coagulated and fragmented states is not the only important factor determining the probability of thermal fragmentation of composite liquid particles. The second essential factor is the actual structure of the composite particle. It is shown that the probability of thermal fragmentation is also strongly dependent on the distance that each of the liquid droplets should travel <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> fragmented state. In particular, if this distance is larger than the mean free path for the considered droplets in the air, the probability of thermal fragmentation should be negligible. In particular, it follows form here that fragmentation of the composite particle in the state with complete encapsulation is highly unlikely because of the larger distance that the two droplets must travel in order <b>to</b> separate. <b>The</b> analysis of composite liquid particles with the interfacial parameters that are expected in combustion aerosols demonstrates that thermal fragmentation of these vi particles may occur, and this mechanism may play a role in the evolution of combustion aerosols. Conditions for thermal fragmentation to play a significant role (for aerosol particles other than those from motor vehicle exhaust) are determined and examined theoretically. Conditions for spontaneous transformation between the states of composite particles with complete and partial encapsulation are also examined, demonstrating the possibility of such transformation in combustion aerosols. Indeed it was shown that for some typical components found in aerosols that transformation could take place on time scales less than 20 s. The analysis showed that factors that influenced surface and interfacial tension played an important role in this transformation process. It is suggested that such transformation may, for example, result in a delayed evaporation of composite particles with significant water component, leading to observable effects in evolution of combustion aerosols (including possible local humidity maximums near a source, such as a busy road). The obtained results will be important for further development and understanding of aerosol physics and technologies, including combustion aerosols and their evolution near a source...|$|R
40|$|Thermoplastic {{sandwich}} {{panels are}} attractive for automotive applications since {{they can be}} readily formed into the light weight complex structures with good impact resistance and high flexural rigidity. In this experimental study, the extent of enhancement in properties achieved {{through the use of}} thermoplastic composite skins combined with a recycled thermoplastic <b>core</b> is demonstrated. <b>The</b> thermal behavior of polypropylene (PP) -based recycled materials and the possibility of turning them into the sandwich panels via a plastic extrusion processing were investigated. A sheet extrudate of recycled thermoplastic composite was sandwiched between two thermoplastic skins on both sides <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> sandwich panels. <b>The</b> <b>core</b> material composed of recycled polypropylene (RPP) and shreds of recycled PP/Fiberglass (e. g. twintex scraps) with the weight ratio of 1 : 1. A commercial thermoplastic skin, TWINTEX, which is a roving made of commingled E-Glass and polypropylene filaments woven into highly conformable fabrics, is used as <b>the</b> face sheets <b>to</b> <b>bond</b> with <b>the</b> <b>core</b> material. A good understanding of principles for manufacturing sandwich panels and performing some experimental optimization leads to making high-strength and strongly-bonded sandwich panels. Results of the mechanical tests (3 -point bending and peel-off test) show that recycled sandwich panels offer better mechanical performance compared with their honeycomb counterparts in terms of flexural strength and skin-to-core bonding and they are more resistant <b>to</b> delamination. <b>The</b> big issue is that they are high-weight materials compared with honeycomb sandwich panels. So we applied some foaming processes using chemical foaming agents <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> density of <b>the</b> <b>core.</b> A significant reduction in sandwich panel’s weight and better mechanical performance could be achieved...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich {{panels are}} layered {{structures}} that consist {{of at least}} five layers : two thin face sheets that are bonded with <b>bonding</b> layers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> thick <b>core.</b> <b>The</b> <b>core</b> has a very low density whereas the face sheets are stiff and strong. The entire panel combines high mechanical properties with a very low areal mass. Most of the structural characteristics of the panel (material selection and thickness of each layer) can be selected independently of other parameters, and the overall characteristics of the panel depend on the particular selection of parameters. Because of {{the wide range of}} panel parameters, numerical modelling is useful to provide insight into the structural characteristics of a particular panel. This paper studies the effect of design parameter variations on the dynamic behaviour of honeycomb sandwich panels. The dynamic behaviour includes natural frequencies, mode shapes and damping of such panels with free boundary conditions. In the first section the structure of honeycomb sandwich panels is illustrated, in particular those with a ThermHex core. For a typical honeycomb panel the different design parameters are outlined. Natural frequencies and mode shapes can be predicted approximately using analytical models. Some of the methods are outlined in this article. The second section of the paper presents the numerical modelling of a sandwich panel using commercial finite element codes. Different core modelling strategies are compared, e. g. geometrically correct or as a homogenised equivalent material. Advantages and drawbacks of the different methods are outlined. Different ways of modelling damping in the panels are also presented. The third section discusses <b>the</b> experimental validation. <b>To</b> validate <b>the</b> finite element models, measurements are carried out on some test panels. Free-free boundary conditions are provided by elastically suspending <b>the</b> panels. <b>To</b> make measurements totally contactless, the test panels are excited acoustically and the vibration measurement is performed with a laser vibrometer. The way the data are captured and processed is also outlined. Measured natural frequencies and mode shapes are compared with the calculated results from the different FE models and the analytical models. The techniques that are used for this comparison are briefly discussed. The different FE models are updated using results from a sensitivity analysis. This analysis is performed theoretically for every design parameter and is discussed in detail. Results from the updated models are again compared with those obtained from measurements. The uncertainty on different design parameters is studied and discussed. The influence of these various uncertainties on the natural frequencies and mode shapes is investigated using Monte Carlo simulations. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Nanoparticles {{represent}} a novel {{class of material}} consisting of hundreds to a few thousand atoms each, and their {{physical and chemical properties}} are significantly different than the bulk materials. The electronic structure, chemical and optical properties of nanoparticles can be tuned by the size, shape, surface modification and interaction with supporting materials, <b>to</b> fulfil <b>the</b> potential specific applications in catalysis, imaging and electronic devices. In the preparation of nanoparticles, protecting ligands {{play a crucial role in}} the dispersion, size control, and shape control of particles. Here in this thesis, ligand functionalization of metal nanoparticles and engineering of carbon nanomaterials were manipulated, and the influence of metal-organic interaction on the chemical, optical and electrochemical properties of nanoparticles and their applications in fuel cell electrocatalysis were studied. Ruthenium nanoparticles protected by ferrocenecarboxylates (RuFCA) were synthesized. The carboxylate group were bound onto the nanoparticle surface via Ru–O bonds in a bidentate configuration which is highly polarized, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> diminishment of the electron density of the iron centers and the increase of formal potential of the ferrocenyl moieties by 120 mV in electrochemical measurements. In addition, galvanic exchange reactions of the RuFCA nanoparticles with Pd(II) followed by hydrothermal treatment at 200 °C led to (partial) decarboxylation of the ligands such that the ferrocenyl moieties were now directly <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metal surface, as manifested in voltammetric measurements that suggested intervalence charge transfer between the nanoparticle-bound ferrocene groups. In a further study, decarboxylation was also found happened at the metal-ligand interface in the hydrothermal treatment of 2 -naphthalenecarboxylate protected ruthenium nanoparticles at higher temperature 250 °C, and the naphthalenyl moieties became directly <b>bonded</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> metal <b>cores,</b> which was confirmed by infrared and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements. In comparison with the as-produced RuCOONA nanoparticles, the decarboxylated nanoparticles (RuNA) exhibited markedly different optical and electronic properties due to electronic coupling between the particle-bound naphthalene groups. The intraparticle charge delocalization led to spilling of nanoparticle core electrons to naphthalene moieties, resulting in the negative shift of the formal potential. In addition, the electron-transfer properties of the ruthenium nanoparticles protected by 1 -dodecyne, laurate and 1 -dodecanethiol were examined by scanning tunneling spectroscopic (STS) measurements. Ruthenium-vinylidene (Ru=C=CH–), –oxygen (Ru-O), and –thiolate (Ru-S) interfacial bonds were formed when protected by alkyne, carboxylate and thiol ligands, respectively, and the polarization of the interfacial <b>bonds</b> was found <b>to</b> increase in <b>the</b> order of Ru=C=CH– < Ru-S < Ru-O. The relatively large nanoparticles (dia. ∼ 3 nm) were found to show clearly-defined Coulomb staircase; and with diminishing particle core dimensions to below 1 nm, Coulomb blockade started <b>to</b> emerge. <b>The</b> nanoparticle molecular capacitance and effective nanoparticle dielectric constants were estimated and the dielectric constants increased inversely with <b>the</b> nanoparticle <b>core</b> dimensions; and at any given particle size, the dielectric constants varied with the specific metal-ligand interfacial bonds, increasing in the order of Ru-S < Ru=C=CH– < Ru-O. Part of the dissertation research was devoted to carbon nanomaterials. In one of the study, nitrogen-doped graphene quantum dots (NGQDs) were prepared by a facile hydrothermal method and incorporated with ruthenium metal ions by exploiting the unique complexation of selected nitrogen dopants with ruthenium ions. Complexation of NGQDs with ruthenium ions likely occurred through the pyridinic nitrogen dopants, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> incorporation of multiple metal centers within the conjugated graphitic C sp 2 scaffolds (Ru-NGQDs). Intervalence charge transfer between embedded Ru ions was studied electrochemically, the Ru-NGQD compounds exhibited two pairs of voltammetric waves, with a peak spacing of 150 mV, suggesting Class II delocalized system. Near-infrared spectroscopic measurements demonstrated an absorption band emerged at ca. 1450 nm at mixed-valence metal charge transfer, by using Ce(SO 4) 2 as the oxidizing reagent. Covalently crosslinking of GQDs were accomplished by forming ensembles of a few hundred nanometers in size by McMurry deoxygenation coupling reactions of peripheral carbonyl functional moieties catalyzed by TiCl 4 and Zn powders in refluxing THF. Photoluminescence measurements showed that after chemical coupling, the excitation and emission peaks blue-shifted somewhat and the emission intensity increased markedly, likely due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> removal of oxygenated species where quinone-like species were known to be effective electron-acceptors and emission quenchers. Metal nanoparticles were also prepared and tuned for the applications as high-performance catalysts. In one of the research, gold core@silver semishell Janus nanoparticles were prepared by interfacial chemical etching of Au@Ag core–shell nanoparticles at the air/water interface. The resulting Janus nanoparticles exhibited an asymmetrical distribution of silver on the surface of <b>the</b> gold <b>cores.</b> Interestingly, <b>the</b> Au@Ag semishell Janus nanoparticles exhibited enhanced electrocatalytic activity in oxygen reduction reactions, as compared to their Au@Ag and Ag@Au core–shell counterparts, likely due to a synergistic effect between <b>the</b> gold <b>cores</b> and silver semishells that optimized oxygen binding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nanoparticle surface. In another research, cysteine-stabilized Ag–Cu hollow nanoshells are prepared by the co-reduction of silver nitrate and cupric nitrate with sodium borohydride in the presence of sodium thiocyanate. When capped with 1 -dodecanethiol, the hollow nanoshells become dispersible in apolar organic solvents and the cavity may be exploited for the effective phase-transfer of target molecules such as rhodamine 6 G between water and organic media. The Ag–Cu nanoshells also show apparent catalytic activity toward the reduction of 4 -nitroaniline by sodium borohydride, a performance that is markedly better than that of the solid counterparts and comparable to leading results in recent literature based on relevant metal catalysts...|$|R
