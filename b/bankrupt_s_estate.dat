40|$|As {{a general}} rule, {{expenses}} incurred in administering a decedent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estate,</b> if not deducted for income tax purposes, and claims against a decedent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estate</b> are deductible for estate tax purposes under Section 2053.

(Under Section 2054, losses incurred during the settlement of estates arising from fires, storms, shipwrecks, or other casualties, or from theft, when such losses are not compensated for by insurance or otherwise, are also deductible.) The IRS recently issued certain final regulations under Section 2053 (reserving certain parts for later regulations) dealing with the estate tax deduction of claims against a decedent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estate</b> and costs of administering the estate, which amend the prior regulations.

40|$|In a {{decoupled}} {{state with}} a smaller exemption, full use of the federal estate tax exemption in the first decedent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estate</b> will result in state death tax being due upon the first decedent 2 ̆ 7 s death (a result of the smaller state exemption). Conversely, if use of the federal estate tax exemption is limited in the decedent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estate</b> to the (smaller) state exemption, then more federal (if not state) estate tax will likely be due upon {{the death of the}} surviving spouse. Limiting use of the exemption in the first estate will increase the federal estate tax marital deduction for that decedent, and property qualifying for a marital deduction in the first decedent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estate</b> will usually be included in the federal taxable estate of the surviving spouse...|$|R

40|$|Historically, the {{volatility}} in exchange rates {{appears to have}} generated so much risk in U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> returns that, from the foreign investor's viewpoint, it eliminated any potential for obtaining diversification benefits from these assets. Yet during {{the past twenty years}} foreigners purchased and continue to hold enormous amounts of U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate.</b> This study examines the use of currency options as a means of hedging the exchange rate risk associated with a foreign investment in U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate.</b> The findings indicate that currency options behave very much like an insurance policy. When used on a continuous basis, they insure foreign investors against any large sudden currency losses and spread the cost of these extreme losses out over time. Thus, from the foreign investor's perspective, the total risk in U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> returns is substantially reduced. However, these improvements are insufficient to make U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> consistently attractive to these investors in a mean-variance portfolio framework. ...|$|R
40|$|Despite the {{large-scale}} purchase of U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> by foreign investors, empirical evidence {{has recently been}} offered that suggests that such investments may not be efficient for portfolio optimization. From the foreign perspective, free-floating exchange rates appear to introduce a level of risk to U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> assets that overrides any potential diversification benefits. For many years, corporate managers have borrowed in the home-country currency of their foreign assets to limit exchange risk exposure. This study investigates this strategy by examining the utility of U. S. dollar-denominated leverage to foreign investors in U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate.</b> Specifically, efficient frontiers are constructed for British and Japanese investors to estimate the diversification gains available from including dollar-leveraged U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> in their respective investment portfolios. ...|$|R

40|$|Large foreign {{acquisitions}} of U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> {{always seem}} to generate considerable public concern. Most recently the reaction has been to Japanese purchases, but similar reactions occurred to Arab petro-dollar purchases in the early 1970 s. This study examines {{the impact of the}} buyer's nationality on the change in the wealth of the selling firm's shareholders for voluntary sell-offs of U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate.</b> In general, this study indicates that voluntary sell-offs of real estate assets result in {{a significant increase in the}} wealth of the selling firm's shareholders. However, the change in the wealth of the selling firm's shareholders for U. S. buyers was not significantly different from that for non-U. S. buyers. Since no advance is indicated for foreign buyers over domestic buyers, laws or regulations hindering the foreign acquisition of U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> cannot be supported. The assumption of a "non-level playing field" for U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> investors who bid against foreign firms for U. <b>S.</b> real <b>estate</b> assets is not confirmed.

40|$|A {{revocable}} {{trust is}} a popular estate planning tool used to disinherit a spouse in sixteen jurisdictions. In common law jurisdictions, a surviving spouse, who is dissatisfied {{with his or her}} inheritance, has the right to receive an elective share of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estate</b> regardless of the decedent 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>estate</b> plan. However, sixteen jurisdictions have defined a dissatisfied spouse 2 ̆ 7 s rights with a fractional share of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 net probate estate, 2 ̆ 2 allowing one spouse to disinherit the other, by single-handedly transferring his or her assets to a revocable trust. To add insult to injury seven of these common law jurisdictions have recently codified trust law making it seamless for the decedent 2 ̆ 7 s creditor to be paid from revocable trust assets. The elective share is one of few limitations imposed on testamentary freedom. Common law property jurisdictions have created a public policybased statute for married persons that prohibit the first-to-die spouse from disinheriting his or her surviving spouse. To avoid disinheritance, common law jurisdictions statutorily protect a surviving spouse (spouse) with an elective share. The elective share arose {{in the early nineteenth century}} as a replacement of dower and curtesy rights. At that time the nature of wealth shifting from real to personal property made dower and curtesy obsolete. The elective share protected the spouse from disinheritance by guaranteeing him or her with a fractional share of the deceased spouse 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> net probate <b>estate,</b> a method known as the traditional elective share. 2 ̆ 7 However, like the shift from real to personal property there has been a subsequent shift in wealth from probate to non-probate assets (like revocable trusts) making the traditional elective share equally obsolete and inadequate to protect a spouse from disinheritance...|$|R
