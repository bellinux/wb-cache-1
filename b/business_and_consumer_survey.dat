We consider all available data taken from the <b>Business</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Survey</b> Indicators for the Euro area between 1985 and 2002. The main results of the forecast competition are offered not only for raw data but we also consider the effects of seasonality and removing outliers on forecast accuracy. In most cases the univariate autoregressions were not outperformed by the other methods. As for the effect of seasonal adjustment methods and the use of data from which outliers have been removed, we obtain that the use of raw data has little effect on forecast accuracy. The forecasting performance of qualitative indicators is important since enlarging the observed time series of these indicators with forecast intervals may help in interpreting and assessing the implications of the current situation and can be used as an input in quantitative forecast models...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Based on <b>Business</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consumer</b> <b>Survey</b> (BCS) data, the European Commission (EC) {{regularly}} {{publishes the}} monthly Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) for each EU member state. ESI is conceptualized {{as a leading}} indicator, aimed ad tracking the overall economic activity. In calculating ESI, the EC employs arbitrarily chosen weights on 15 BCS response balances. This paper raises the predictive quality of ESI by applying nonlinear programming to find such weights that maximize the correlation coefficient of ESI and year-on-year GDP growth. The obtained {{results show that the}} highest weights are assigned to the response balances of industrial sector questions, followed by questions from the retail trade sector. This comes as no surprise since the existing literature shows that the industrial production is a plausible proxy for the overall Croatian economic activity and since Croatian GDP is largely influenced by the aggregate personal consumption...|$|E
40|$|In {{the last}} five decades the European Economic Sentiment Indicator (ESI) has {{positioned}} itself as a high-quality leading indicator of overall economic activity. Relying on data from five distinct <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>survey</b> sectors (industry, retail trade, services, construction and the consumer sector), ESI is conceptualized as a weighted average of the chosen 15 response balances. However, the official methodology of calculating ESI is quite flawed because of the arbitrarily chosen balance response weights. This paper proposes two alternative methods for obtaining novel weights aimed at enhancing ESI 2 ̆ 7 s forecasting power. Specifically, the weights are determined by minimizing the {{root mean square error}} in simple GDP forecasting regression equations; and by maximizing the correlation coefficient between ESI and GDP growth for various lead lengths (up to 12 months). Both employed methods seem to considerably increase ESI 2 ̆ 7 s forecasting accuracy in 26 individual European Union countries. The obtained results are quite robust across specifications...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the methodologies used for constructing a composite leading indicator for the Austrian economy (CLI-AT). First, {{a selection of}} those monthly indicators which overall fare best in showing a "steady" leading behaviour {{with respect to the}} Austrian business cycle was performed. The analysis was carried out by means of statistical methods out of the timeseries domain {{as well as from the}} frequency domain. Thirteen series have been finally classified as leading indicators. Among them, <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>survey</b> data form the most prevalent group. Second, I construct the CLI-AT based on the de-trended, normalised and weighted leading series. For the de-trending procedure I use the HP filter and the weights have been obtained by means of principal components analysis. Further, idiosyncratic elements in the CLI-AT have been removed along with checking the endpoint-bias due to the HP filter smoothing procedure. I find that the "real-time" smoothed CLI-AT does not exhibit severe phase-shifts compared to a full-sample estimate. Next, I show that the CLI-AT provides a useful instrument for assessing the current and likely future direction in the Austrian business cycle. Over the period 1988 - 2008, the CLI-AT indicates cyclical turns with a "steady" lead in the majority of cases. Finally, in using an out-of-sample forecasting exercise it is shown that the CLI-AT carries important business cycle information and that its inclusion in a forecasting model can increase the projection quality of the underlying reference series.

While the fast availability of the results and {{the wide range of}} variables covered have made them very useful for monitoring {{the current state of the}} economy, there is no consensus on their usefulness for forecasting macroeconomic developments. The objective of this paper is to analyse the possibility of improving forecasts for selected macroeconomic variables for the euro area using the information provided by these surveys. After analyzing the potential presence of seasonality and the issue of quantification, we tested whether these indicators provide useful information for improving forecasts of the macroeconomic variables. With this aim, different sets of models have been considered (AR, ARIMA, SETAR, Markov switching regime models and VAR) to obtain forecasts for the selected macroeconomic variables. Then, information from surveys has been considered for forecasting these variables in the context of the following models: autoregressive, VAR, Markov switching regime and leading indicator models. In all cases, the root mean square error (RMSE) has been computed for different forecast horizons. The comparison of the forecasting performance of the two sets of models permits us to conclude that, in most cases, models that include information from the surveys have lower RMSEs than the best model without survey information. However, this reduction is only significant in a limited number of cases. In this sense, the results obtained extend the results of previous research that has included information from <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>surveys</b> to explain the behaviour of macroeconomic variables, but are not conclusive about its role...|$|R

This thesis work is studying what is mobile payment, the success factors of the most successful mobile money implementation M-PESA in Kenya and making the comparison to competing systems. In addition, the impact and importance of mobile money services is studied for businesses using the service, as well as what type of customer base is using the mobile money. Finally, a review is conducted over the recent and emerging business opportunities enabled by the mobile money, and innovations around it. The study is based on literature reviews, empirical experience-based analysis, and quantitative analysis of <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumer</b> <b>survey</b> data from World Bank. M-PESA is a combination of well-planned and implemented product innovation, which is useful for both consumers and businesses.

40|$|A factor based {{approach}} {{is often used}} to build Composite Indicators (CI) from qualitative data stemming from <b>Business</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consumers</b> <b>Survey</b> (BCS). Bruno <b>and</b> Malgarini (2002) and Gayer and Genet (2006) have used factor analysis to synthesize the information contained in the balances of the various surveys Harmonized by the EC (industry, <b>consumers,</b> retail, building <b>and</b> services). However, Marcellino (2006) pointed out that the use of aggregate balance series could imply missing relevant information contained in the surveys. For this reason, in this paper we consider additional information stemming from the percentage of equal answers; moreover, we also use more disaggregate data at the branch level (considering socio-economics characteristics of the respondents for the <b>consumers</b> <b>survey).</b> More specifically, we consider Main Industrial Groupings for the industry survey; small and large multiple shops for the retail survey; building and civil engineering for the construction survey; households <b>and</b> <b>business</b> services for the service survey. Variables {{to be included in the}} analysis are pre selected prior to factor extraction on the basis of their contemporaneous or leading/lagging correlation with sector-specific target series. Three methods are then used to extract Composite Indicators, namely Static Principal Component Analysis and Static and Dynamic Factor Analysis (Forni, Hallin, Lippi, Reichlin, 2000, 2001). The various Composite Indicators obtained from the factor based approach are then investigated against the traditional Confidence Indicators in terms of performance with respect to the reference series. As alternative evaluation criteria we use: a) the cross-correlation between the CI and the reference series; b) the directional coherence of movement with the targets; c) turning points analysis (determined applying the Bry-Boschan method). Finally, from the whole set of data stemming from ISAE <b>business</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> <b>survey</b> we extract aggregate Composite Indicators for the whole Italian economy using the same methods and evaluation criteria outlined above.

The analysis shows that European consumers hold different opinions of inflation depending on their income, age, education and gender. Although many of the features highlighted for the EU and the euro area aggregates are valid across individual Member States, differences exist also at the country level. Despite the higher inflation estimates, there is a high level of co-movement between measured and estimated (perceived/expected) inflation. Even respondents providing estimates largely above actual HICP inflation, demonstrate understanding of the relative level of inflation during both high and low inflation periods. Based on these economically plausible results, the report concludes that further work should be devoted to defining concrete aggregate indicators of consumers' quantitative inflation perceptions and expectations on the basis of the dataset used in this study.

Indicators based on surveys among businesses, households, financial market analysts or forecasters have the advantage of providing detailed and timely information on individual sectors on a monthly basis and largely without later revision.

Even the most reliable economic indicators, however, can only be interpreted as constituent elements of comprehensive economic analysis.

As the reliability of economic indicators increases as forecasting institutions and respondents gain more experience, coverage of established indicators should be extended early on to this group of countries, in particular as some of the new Member States may soon join the euro area.

This paper presents a case study of a community portal, focusing on planning and implementation issues specifically in relation to two key stakeholder groups of <b>businesses</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers.</b> Both <b>businesses</b> <b>and</b> <b>consumers</b> were <b>surveyed</b> with results identifying two key success factors, firstly the need to focus on not only the establishment phase of the portal but also the longer term growth and development of the portal and secondly, the importance of considering the needs of all stakeholder groups at initial planning and implementation phases, rather than focussing on one stakeholder group. Overall the results question the viability of regional community portals {{if they are to be}} self-funding...|$|R
