40|$|Aim: The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} and compare the shear bond strength of nano-hydroxyapatite (Nano-HAp) incorporated and conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC). Materials and Methods: Nano-HAp GIC was prepared by replacing 8 wt% of GIC powder with nano-HAp powder. Twenty-six HAp disks were used as substrate for bonding and divided into two equal groups. Before bonding the HAp disk was prepared by silicon carbide (no. 2500) followed by 10 % polyacrylic acid conditioning. The standardized samples were prepared using split teflon mold on customized <b>bonding</b> <b>jig</b> so as to adhere testing materials to pretreated HAp disk. These samples were stored in distilled water for 24 h at 37 °C before bond strength testing. Results: The descriptive statistical analysis and independent samples t-test were used. The nano-HAp incorporated and conventional GIC had the mean shear bond strength of 3. 28 ± 0. 89 MPa and 5. 25 ± 0. 88 MPa, respectively. Nano-HAp incorporated GIC had lower shear bond strength with {{very high level of}} significance (P < 0. 001). The nano-HAp incorporated GIC showed mainly mixed type of failure whereas conventional GIC showed mainly a cohesive failure. Conclusion: The lower shear bond strength of nano-HAp incorporate GIC revealed that the addition of nano-HAp interfered with the bonding ability of GIC to the substrate interface, but the mixed type of failure in nano-HAp incorporated GIC suggests that it increases the strength of the matrix. However, the role of nano-size particles on the micro-size particles of GIC for the bonding mechanism and the ratio and proportions of nano-HAp to the GIC needs further elucidation...|$|E
40|$|Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) Background: All-ceramic restorations have {{excellent}} esthetic outcomes {{compared with other}} restorative materials. Lithium disilicate is classified as one of many silica-based all-ceramic materials. Currently, companies have provided single-step adhesives, known as universal adhesives, compatible with different restorative materials including lithium disilicate. Many studies have reported greater bond strengths when using a silane to treat the lithium disilicate before applying the bonding agent. Moreover, few studies were published comparing the bond strength when using the universal adhesive alone. Purpose: The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate and compare shear bond strength of three universal adhesives to lithium disilicate ceramic restorative material. Materials and Methods: Three universal adhesive bonding agents were selected from commercially available adhesives. 408 IPS e. max CAD ceramic discs were processed, fired, and etched for 20 s. The specimens were divided into six groups. The first three groups used the universal adhesive directly. The remaining three groups were treated with silane. Then, a composite resin cylinder was placed on top of the adhesive using a <b>bonding</b> <b>jig.</b> Each group was subdivided into four equal subgroups (n = 17), subjected to different aging simulation procedures: 24 h, one month with 5000 thermocycles, two months with 5000 cycles, and three months with 5000 cycles. Then, specimens were debonded using shear force by a universal testing machine (MTS). Results: Shear bond strength was greater with silane than without silane (p < 0. 0001), regardless of the levels of adhesive or time. Shear bond strength was significantly greater at 24 h and 1 m than at 2 m (p < 0. 0001) or 3 m (p < 0. 0001) regardless of the adhesive or the presence of silane. Debonded specimens were examined under a stereomicroscope at X 45 magnification to evaluate the fracture pattern. SEM was used to prove the results were considered as mixed failure. Conclusion: The optimal bonds to lithium disilicate are achieved by application of silane prior to application of a universal adhesive. Although the constituent silane in the universal adhesive was not effective in optimizing the resin to ceramic bond, silane should always be applied to lithium disilicate prior to bonding. 1 yea...|$|E
40|$|Following the {{successful}} design and fabrication of Damped Detuned Structures (DDS), the JLC/NLC linear collider project advanced to Rounded Damped Detuned Structures (RDDS) with curved {{cross section of}} the cavity shape for increased shunt impedance. Various advanced techniques for fabricating RDDS 1 disks comparing to those for DDS were established to satisfy the dimension accuracy of +- 1 micron over the entire surface made by ultra-precision turning. These disks were assembled with almost the same stacking and <b>bonding</b> <b>jigs</b> and processes as those of DDS 3 assembly. In consequence, the assembly showed little disk-to-disk misalignment within 1 micron before and after the process. Though, it had 200 micron smooth bowing, which was subsequently corrected as DDS 3, and flares at both ends. Comment: 3 page...|$|R
