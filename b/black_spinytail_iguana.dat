5000|$|Ctenosaura hemilopha, {{also known}} as the cape <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana</b> , is a species of <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana</b> endemic to Baja California. [...] It is {{arboreal}} and primarily herbivorous, although it can be an opportunistic carnivore. Males may grow up to 100 cm in length, while females are smaller, with a length of up to 70 cm. Five subspecies are currently recognized.|$|R

5000|$|Like most iguanids, {{the cape}} <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana</b> is {{primarily}} herbivorous, eating flowers, leaves, stems, fruit, and cactus {{such as the}} bushy Jatropha cuneata and the taller, spindly Solanum hindsianum. [...] They will opportunistically eat smaller animals, eggs, and arthropods.|$|R
50|$|The cape <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana</b> has a {{green or}} yellow {{coloring}} when young and turns whitish gray with age. As this animal matures {{it can be}} white or light gray in color with black chevrons, depending on heat conditions or even the animal's temper.|$|R
50|$|Northeastern <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguanas</b> are {{excellent}} climbers, and prefer a rocky habitat {{with plenty of}} crevices to hide in, rocks to bask on, and nearby trees to climb. They are diurnal and fast moving, employing their speed to escape predators but will lash with their tails and bite if cornered.|$|R
5000|$|The {{island is}} home to an endemic cactus Echinocereus websterianus. [...] Endemic fauna include the San Pedro Nolasco Island <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana</b> (Ctenosaura nolascenensis) and, formerly, Pemberton's deer mouse (Peromyscus pembertoni [...] ), a rodent which is now extinct. Large numbers of California sea lions {{frequent}} its surrounding waters and use the island as a haul-out.|$|R
5000|$|The northeastern <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by British zoologist George Shaw in 1802. The generic name, Ctenosaura, {{is derived from}} two Greek words: ctenos (Κτενός), meaning [...] "comb" [...] (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (σαύρα), meaning [...] "lizard". Its specific name is the Greek word akanthos (Ἄκανθος), meaning [...] "thorn".|$|R
50|$|Northeastern <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguanas</b> have {{distinctive}} keeled {{scales on}} their long tails, which {{give them their}} common name. The males are capable of growing up to 1.4 m in total length and females slightly shorter at 1 m. They have a crest of long spines which extends {{down the center of}} the back. Their base color is black with white or cream-colored markings.|$|R
5000|$|Ctenosaura is {{a lizard}} genus {{commonly}} known as <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguanas</b> or Ctenosaurs. The genus {{is part of the}} large lizard family, Iguanidae and is native to Mexico and Central America. The name is derived from two Greek words: ctenos (κτενός), meaning [...] "comb" [...] (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (σαύρα), meaning [...] "lizard".|$|R
5000|$|The cape <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana</b> {{makes its}} den in old {{woodpecker}} nests in giant columnar cacti, {{and in other}} tree cavities. [...] The most important factors determining the choice of cactus are the existence of other holes, and the cactus height because these types of refuges allow the lizards to feed and bask on the tree, minimizing the risk of predation.|$|R
2500|$|The Mexican <b>Spinytail</b> <b>Iguana</b> {{was first}} {{described}} by German zoologist Arend Friedrich August Wiegmann in 1834. [...] The generic name, Ctenosaura, {{is derived from}} two Greek words: ctenos (Κτενός), meaning [...] "comb" [...] (referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back and tail), and saura (σαύρα), meaning [...] "lizard". Its specific name is the Latin word pectinata meaning [...] "combed", also referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back.|$|R
25|$|Phylogenic {{study shows}} this species {{to be most}} closely related to C. acanthura, the Northeastern <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana.</b> Additional {{mitochondrial}} DNA research is being performed to determine whether additional subspecies may exist. Because of the different human cultures throughout this species distribution, the clades are being evaluated for their impact from humans. For example, these iguanas are not eaten in their northern ranges by humans {{as they are in}} the southern ranges, but the hatchlings in the southern ranges have a better survival rate due to better environmental conditions.|$|R

[...] They {{are one of}} the larger members of the genus Ctenosaura, capable of growing to 1.3m (4.3 feet) in length, with females being slightly smaller than males at , and are typically brown or grey-brown in coloration with a yellowish ventral surface. [...] They have a crest of long spines which extend down the center of their back. Hatchlings are often a bright green color with no pattern and darken as they age.|$|R

Its specific name is the Latin word pectinata meaning [...] "combed", also referring to the comblike spines on the lizard's back.The genus it belongs to represents the most diverse group of iguanas with 15 currently recognized species. These species inhabit lowland (below 1200m elevation) dry forests on both coasts of Mexico and Central America. All species of Ctenosaura fall within one of seven clades. Distributions of these clades fall geographically within well established areas. Closely related species show allopatry whereas species from divergent clades show sympatry.Phylogenic study shows this species to be most closely related to C. acanthura, the Northeastern <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana.</b> Additional mitochondrial DNA research is being performed to determine whether additional subspecies may exist.

5000|$|Contrary to myth, {{the snake}} does not crush the prey, or break its bones. Also, {{contrary}} to previous belief, the snake {{does not cause}} suffocation by constricting the victim. Instead, a study of death caused by boa constrictors, showed that constriction [...] "shuts off" [...] blood flow (and therefore oxygen) needed by vital organs such as the heart and brain, which would lead to unconsciousness and death very quickly - in seconds - in other words, constriction can interrupt blood flow and overwhelm the prey's usual blood pressure and circulation. [...] Artery pressure drops, vein pressure increases, and blood vessels begin to close. The heart {{does not have enough}} strength to pump against the pressure and blood flow stops. Internal organs with high metabolic rates, including the brain, liver, and the heart begin to stop and die due to ischemia, a loss of oxygen and glucose. There is evidence that boa constrictors have more difficulty killing ectotherms, animals like lizards and snakes that rely on external heat to regulate their body temperatures. A boa constrictor was observed attacking a <b>spinytail</b> <b>iguana</b> for an hour, and the iguana survived.|$|R
