5|$|The {{interior}} of the 1883 room has been restored to its original appearance. The red oak floor is trimmed by nine inches of mop board and quarter-round, decoratively accented. The two curved and semi-circular front walls mark the two coat rooms in the original, one-room building. The rounded walls hold a chair rail and are wainscoted below the <b>blackboards.</b> <b>Blackboards</b> cover available space on the north, east, and south walls.

25|$|The {{earliest}} interesting {{patterns in}} the Game of Life were discovered {{without the use of}} computers. The simplest static patterns ("still lifes") and repeating patterns ("oscillators"—a superset of still lifes) were discovered while tracking the fates of various small starting configurations using graph paper, <b>blackboards,</b> physical game boards (such as Go) and the like. During this early research, Conway discovered that the R-pentomino failed to stabilize in a small number of generations. In fact, it takes 1103 generations to stabilize, by which time it has a population of 116 and has fired six escaping gliders (these were the first gliders ever discovered).|$|E

While the basic features of Hearsay-II remain in today’s <b>blackboard</b> systems, numerous advances and enhancements have been made {{as a result of}} experience gained in using <b>blackboard</b> systems in widely varying application areas.

25|$|Anime {{follows the}} typical {{production}} of animation, including storyboarding, voice acting, character design, and cel production (Shirobako, itself a series, highlights {{many of the}} aspects involved in anime production). Since the 1990s, animators have increasingly used computer animation to improve {{the efficiency of the}} production process. Artists like Noburō Ōfuji pioneered the earliest anime works, which were experimental and consisted of images drawn on <b>blackboards,</b> stop motion animation of paper cutouts, and silhouette animation. Cel animation grew in popularity until it came to dominate the medium. In the 21st century, the use of other animation techniques is mostly limited to independent short films, including the stop motion puppet animation work produced by Tadahito Mochinaga, Kihachirō Kawamoto and Tomoyasu Murata. Computers were integrated into the animation process in the 1990s, with works such as Ghost in the Shell and Princess Mononoke mixing cel animation with computer-generated images. Fuji Film, a major cel production company, announced it would stop cel production, producing an industry panic to procure cel imports and hastening the switch to digital processes.|$|E

40|$|The <b>blackboard</b> {{model is}} a {{flexible}} problem-solving approach where the data and knowledge rules are strictly separated. The data generated during a problem resolution, from a problem statement to a solution through various stages of inferences, is centrally stored in many forms of objects. The knowledge rules are divided into independent experts; each expert contributes to the resolution with its {{knowledge of how to}} search for a (partial) solution of (parts of) the problem. A <b>blackboard</b> system is composed of three main components: the <b>blackboard,</b> which is a database containing data and hypotheses; knowledge sources, which examine the state of the <b>blackboard</b> and create new data or hypotheses; and a control mechanism, which regulates the incremental hypothesizing and testing. A <b>blackboard</b> application is a particular problem-solving system developed on top of a <b>blackboard</b> framework.

Private schools vary in quality, with the most expensive conducting lessons in English (seen {{as a key to}} children's success) and having computers in classrooms.

Lower-cost private schools attracted children from lower-income families or those lower-income families with higher education aspirations.

40|$|A <b>blackboard</b> system {{consists}} {{of a set of}} knowledge sources, a <b>blackboard</b> data structure, and a control strategy used to activate the knowledge sources. The <b>blackboard</b> model of problem– solving is best described by Dr. H.

The <b>blackboard</b> is also used to allow inter-knowledge source communication and acts as a shared memory visible to all of the knowledge sources. A knowledge source is a highly specialized, highly independent process that takes inputs from the <b>blackboard</b> data structure, performs a computation, and places the results of the computation in the <b>blackboard</b> data structure. This design allows for an opportunistic control strategy. The opportunistic problem–solving technique allows a knowledge source to contribute towards the solution of the current proble...|$|R
40|$|In his 1992 Ph.

In January 2016, Fazekas elaborated, saying that the Darkforce, known as Zero Matter in the series, {{is the result of}} a nuclear test gone wrong by Isodyne Energy. Looking to the history of the Darkforce in the comics, Fazekas and Butters [...] "were able to select what we liked and sort of make our own rules as to what it does, how it operates, and who it affects in our world." [...] The producers tried to take a scientific approach to the explanation of the Zero Matter, consulting with theoretical physicist Clifford Johnson to help ground it in science. Johnson provided the science equations seen on <b>blackboards</b> throughout the season, as well as real world reference for the Zero Matter containment systems. The showrunners also conversed with Eric Carroll at Marvel Studios to ensure anything they were doing with the Darkforce would not contradict the Doctor Strange script, and to see if they could destroy Howard Stark's hover car, which was originally seen as a prototype in Captain America: The First Avenger. The mention in the season finale of the land Stark owns in Malibu is a reference to what will become the location for the home of his son, Tony, in the MCU films.|$|E
