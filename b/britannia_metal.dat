5|$|A 1937 {{survey by}} the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a {{rectangular}} font made of gritstone, of unknown date, and a memorial to a Sion Evan and his son Evan Jones, who died in 1790 and 1822 respectively. A survey of church plate within the Bangor diocese in 1906 recorded a chalice and paten made of <b>Britannia</b> <b>metal</b> (a pewter alloy), and an electro-plated set of communion vessels. It noted that the old silver communion service had been stolen.|$|E
5|$|In the 1740s Benjamin Huntsman, a clock {{maker in}} Handsworth, invented {{a form of}} the {{crucible}} steel process for making {{a better quality of}} steel than had previously been available. At around the same time Thomas Boulsover invented a technique for fusing a thin sheet of silver onto a copper ingot producing a form of silver plating that became known as Sheffield plate. Originally hand-rolled Old Sheffield Plate was used for making silver buttons. Then in 1751 Joseph Hancock, previously apprenticed to Boulsover's friend Thomas Mitchell, first used it to make kitchen and tableware. This prospered and in 1762–65 Hancock built the water-powered Old Park Silver Mills at the confluence of the Loxley and the Don, one of the earliest factories solely producing an industrial semi-manufacture. Eventually Old Sheffield Plate was supplanted by cheaper electroplate in the 1840s. In 1773 Sheffield was given a silver assay office. In the late 18th century, <b>Britannia</b> <b>metal,</b> a pewter-based alloy similar in appearance to silver, was invented in the town.|$|E
25|$|Norwood Grange {{stands at}} the {{junction}} of Herries Road and Longley Lane. It is a gabled house built in the 1850s for Thomas Fisher, {{a partner in the}} <b>Britannia</b> <b>metal</b> company of Shaw and Fisher. After a succession of owners the Grange was purchased by Sheffield Council just before World War II. During the conflict it was used by the Auxiliary Fire Service and Air Raid Wardens as a base. The house fell into a dilapidated state in the post war years. In the early 1990s the main house was restored and extended and turned into Norwood Grange Residential Home. Some of the outbuildings are still in a run down state.|$|E

It was a standard style priced at $20 ($462.05 in 2010 dollars) in Reed and Barton's 1910 catalog. The inscription reads [...] "Arizona Foot Ball League Championship 1899 Normal".|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{technical}} personnel from the then Union Miniére worked with MIM Holdings personnel {{to develop an}} ISASMELT-based process to treat scrap materials and residues containing copper and lead. Union Miniére operated a smelter at Hoboken, near Antwerpen in Belgium, that specialised in recycling scrap non-ferrous materials. The test work program was undertaken using an ISASMELT test rig at MIM Holdings’ lead refinery, <b>Britannia</b> Refined <b>Metals,</b> at Northfleet in the United Kingdom.|$|R
2500|$|The {{model for}} the {{statuette}} {{is said to be}} Mexican actor Emilio [...] "El Indio" [...] Fernández. Sculptor George Stanley (who also did the Muse Fountain at the Hollywood Bowl) sculpted Cedric Gibbons' design. The statuettes presented at the initial ceremonies were gold-plated solid bronze. Within a few years the bronze was abandoned in favor of <b>britannia</b> <b>metal,</b> a pewter-like alloy which is then plated in copper, nickel silver, and finally, 24-karat gold. Due to a metal shortage during World War II, Oscars were made of painted plaster for three years. Following the war, the Academy invited recipients to redeem the plaster figures for gold-plated metal ones. The only addition to the Oscar since it was created is a minor streamlining of the base. The original Oscar mold was cast in 1928 at the C.W. Shumway & Sons Foundry in Batavia, Illinois, which also contributed to casting the molds for the Vince Lombardi Trophy and Emmy Award's statuettes. From 1983 to 2015, approximately 50 Oscars were made each year in Chicago by Illinois manufacturer R.S. Owens & Company. It takes between three and four weeks to manufacture 50 statuettes.|$|E

60|$|Traddles's {{house is}} one of the very houses--or it easily may have been--which he and Sophy used to parcel out, in their evening walks. It is a large house; but Traddles keeps his papers in his dressing-room and his boots with his papers; and he and Sophy squeeze {{themselves}} into upper rooms, reserving the best bedrooms for the Beauty and the girls. There is no room to spare in the house; for more of 'the girls' are here, and always are here, by some accident or other, than I know how to count. Here, when we go in, is a crowd of them, running down to the door, and handing Traddles about to be kissed, until he is out of breath. Here, established in perpetuity, is the poor Beauty, a widow with a little girl; here, at dinner on Sophy's birthday, are the three married girls with their three husbands, and one of the husband's brothers, and another husband's cousin, and another husband's sister, who appears to me to be engaged to the cousin. Traddles, exactly the same simple, unaffected fellow as he ever was, sits {{at the foot of the}} large table like a Patriarch; and Sophy beams upon him, from the head, across a cheerful space that is certainly not glittering with <b>Britannia</b> <b>metal.</b>|$|E
50|$|Born in Sheffield, Hobson {{completed}} an apprenticeship in metalworking, and worked until the 1890s with <b>Britannia</b> <b>metal</b> at Atkin Brothers.

50|$|The Bottom-blown Oxygen Converter or BBOCTM is a {{smelting}} furnace {{developed by the}} staff at <b>Britannia</b> Refined <b>Metals</b> Limited (“BRM”), a British subsidiary of MIM Holdings Limited (which {{is now part of}} the Glencore group of companies). The furnace is currently marketed by Glencore Technology. It is a sealed, flat-bottomed furnace mounted on a tilting frame that is used in the recovery of precious metals. A key feature is the use of a shrouded lance to inject oxygen through the bottom of the furnace, directly into the precious metals contained in the furnace, to oxidize base metals or other impurities as part of their removal as slag.|$|R

Dec 1975 Gordon left Cosy Glide to take up a position as a Laboratory Assistant for Duffay Titanine and the <b>Britannia</b> Refining <b>Metals</b> until 1980 until he moved to London to work for the Post Office in Holborn, London WC1, Gordon's last 'normal' job until taking up DJing full-time in 1982. From 1977 to 1980 Gordon took evening classes at Gravesend Technical College to study O Level then Advanced level in English Language and English Literature. A period of his life that gave Gordon the necessary education to later write weekly newspaper columns.|$|R
40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. Does the lead industry have a future, {{in the face of}} the developing environmental challenge? This thesis addresses this question and concludes, it should have for the foreseeable future, providing it adopts the changes detailed. These changes are posited within a framework, which consists of a strategy, approaches and tools. The changes are both technical and philosophical. They are technical, in the sense that the tools and approaches provide practical means whereby the environmental `risks' may be identified, assessed and managed. They are philosophical, because they set out and identify the features of a new conceptual paradigm, whose basis is in the concept of the `risk society'. The paradigm is significantly more holistic, multi-dimensional, inherently flexible, and is intended to be reflexive. Adoption of the elements of the framework, will facilitate a more effective establishment, and management of environmental `risk' credentials, which will help encourage better environmental decision making. Hence, it will facilitate, the balancing of resource consumption and environmental impact costs, versus social and economic benefits, in an improved manner. The modelling approaches, and selected inventory and environmental impact assessment tools, enclosed within this thesis, have been designed to facilitate the development of, and to function within, the new paradigm. These have been developed for BRM and MIM case studies, and function at the site-specific and the cradle-to-gate scales. The former consider the company site of <b>Britannia</b> Refined <b>Metals</b> (BRM) Ltd., where refining to produce primary and secondary refined lead products takes place, whilst the latter consider the life-cycle of the refined primary lead products of MIM Ltd. The modelling approaches have also been designed so, that they may be re-aggregated into models able to operate at many different scales, as required. The framework, and its elements, are applicable for all industries facing similar challenges. <b>Britannia</b> Refined <b>Metals</b> Ltd. (BRM...|$|R

50|$|The MIM Holdings Board of Directors {{approved}} {{the construction of}} an ISASMELT plant at <b>Britannia</b> Refined <b>Metals,</b> the company’s lead refinery at Northfleet in the United Kingdom, for commercial recovery of lead from battery paste to supplement the existing plant, which used a short rotary furnace to produce 10,000 t/y of lead. The new plant increased annual production to 30,000 t/y of recycled lead, and was commissioned in 1991. The ISASMELT furnace was used to produce low-antimony lead bullion from the battery paste and an antimony-rich slag that contained 55-65% lead oxide. While it was possible to recover the lead from the slag in the ISASMELT furnace by a reduction step, the total throughput of the plant was increased by treating the slag in the short rotary furnace when sufficient quantities of the slag had been generated. The plant was designed to treat 7.7 t/h of battery paste, but routinely treated 12 t/h. The plant was shut down in 2004 when Xstrata Zinc, which took over the MIM Holdings lead operations, decided to leave the lead recycling business.|$|R
5000|$|Once In Rock {{had been}} completed, EMI {{asked for a}} {{suitable}} single to be recorded to help promote the album. Though Roger Glover claims that Ricky Nelson's 1962 hard rocking arrangement of the George Gershwin song [...] "Summertime" [...] {{was the basis for}} the Mk II Deep Purple single [...] "Black Night", it is also similar to Blues Magoos's 1966 psychedelic hit song [...] "(We Ain't Got) Nothin' Yet". In the BBC documentary Heavy <b>Metal</b> <b>Britannia,</b> keyboardist Jon Lord supports Glover's statement about the song's origin, stating [...] "Black Night was nicked from the bass line in Ricky Nelson's Summertime" [...] and then proceeds to play the bassline riff on his grand piano.|$|R
