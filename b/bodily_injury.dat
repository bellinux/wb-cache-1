Notwithstanding this trite provision of our law, the dissertation contends that medical expenses as a head of damages is inherently patrimonial. In essence, {{the true nature of}} medical expenses as a loss that ultimately affects both the patrimonial and non-patrimonial interests of the individual, is considered. Furthermore, the dissertation analyses the assessment and quantification mechanisms in our law, and makes a comparative study with the corresponding positions in England and Australia. The intended outcome of this dissertation is to provide clear guidelines for the award of damages, particularly where future loss is involved. Private LawLL...|$|R

Plevinskis Odessa National Medical University, Odessa, Ukraine Abstract Forensic-medical examiners face with the cases of car and bicyclist contact in their practice. The main goal of examination is to determine the variant of car, bicycle and bicyclist’s body contact, that’s why it is necessary to determine the mechanism of <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries</b> forming, taking to consideration various trace-forming objects, which can contribute to injuries’ forming on the bicyclist’s body. It is possible to classify the type of traffic accidents according to the types and quantity of the traumatic objects for the bicyclist’s body and according to the sequence of contacting of the vehicle, bicycle and bicyclist’s body. Not all questions could be solved by forensic-medical examiner (on example, questions about sequence and phases of <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries</b> forming), that’s why in such cases it is necessary to perform complex forensic-medical and transport-trasological examination with obligatory studying of the vehicle, which participated in traffic accident, bicycle, driven by the injured person, clothes and shoes of the injured bicyclist, bicyclist’s <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries</b> and results of the scene of incident inspection. All bicyclist’s <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries</b> could be divided on three large groups: <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries,</b> which have formed in the result of primary contact of the bicyclist’s body and parts of the car; <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries,</b> which have formed in the result of body’s throw on the defined parts of the car; <b>bodily</b> <b>injuries,</b> which have formed in the result of bicyclist’s contact with the road. Algorithm of research in the case of forensic-medical examination of injured bicyclist was created, which predicts cooperation of forensic-medical and transport-trasological examiners and gives a possibility for more effective solving of forensic tasks. Key words: forensic-medical examination, bicyclsit's injury, algorithm of complex examination, types of car and bicycle contact...|$|R

Since 2003, male homosexual prostitution has also been prosecuted under the law.|$|E

Most law enforcement agencies establish a use of force continuum and list deadly force as a force of last resort. With this model, agencies try to control excessive use of force. Nonetheless, some question the number of killings by law enforcement officers, including killings of people who are unarmed, raising questions about widespread and ongoing excessive use of force. Other non-fatal incidents and arrests have raised similar concerns.|$|E
