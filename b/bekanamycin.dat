40|$|The {{absorption}} of doxycycline (DOTC), <b>bekanamycin</b> (AKM), cefazolin (CEZ), penicillin G (PC-G), prednisolone, and human IgG through the rabbit's tracheal mucosa was examined using the double-chamber method. The {{results indicate that}} the tracheal mucosa can absorb both small molecules and macromolecules. Passing through the intercellular space, DOTC, a small molecule, was absorbed through the tracheal epithelium by diffusion. Human IgG, a macromolecule, was absorbed by the mechanism of an energy-consuming transport process. This study of the {{absorption of}} drugs through the respiratory mucosa could open up new areas in the utilization of intrarespiratory administration of drugs and lead {{to a better understanding of}} the mechanisms involved in respiratory allergies...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} 50 {{antibiotics}} on the detection and determination of bacterial endotoxins by the chromogenic method using a Limulus reagent (Tachypleus hemocyte lysate) and a chromogenic substrate of p-nitroaniline derivatives were tested, and the antibiotic concentration for 50 % inhibition of the chromogenic {{reaction in the}} presence of 0. 5 ng of endotoxin (Escherichia coli 0111 :B 4) per ml was estimated. All the antibiotic preparations were depyrogenized by ultrafiltration treatment before they were subjected to the test. The reaction was conducted {{in the presence of}} a high concentration (0. 5 M) of Tris buffer to constantly maintain the pH of the reaction mixture, and liberated p-nitroaniline was determined by high-pressure liquid chromatography. Several aminoglycosides (amikacin, <b>bekanamycin,</b> kanamycin, and streptomycin sulfate), bleomycin hydrochloride, and fosfomycin disodium showed no inhibition of the reaction up to 20 mg/ml. However, other antibiotics, including penicillins, cephalosporins, macrolides, and tetracyclines, inhibited the reaction concentration dependently. Polymyxin B sulfate was the most potent inhibitor, with less than 8 micrograms/ml for 50 % inhibition. It was concluded that the chromogenic method can be applied to the detection and determination of endotoxin in most of the antibiotic preparations. An application of this method to carbenicillin disodium preparations was exemplified...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} methods {{for studying the}} interactions between small molecules and RNA and have applied them to characterize the binding of three classes of aminoglycoside antibiotics to ribosomal RNA subdomains. High-resolution MS was used to quantitatively identify the noncovalent binding interactions between mixtures of aminoglycosides and multiple RNA targets simultaneously. Signal overlap among RNA targets was avoided {{by the addition of}} neutral mass tags that direct each RNA target to a unique region of the spectrum. In addition to determining binding affinities, the locations of the binding sites on the RNAs were identified from a protection pattern generated by fragmenting the aminoglycoside/RNA complex. Specific complexes were observed for the prokaryotic rRNA A-site subdomain with ribostamycin, paromomycin, and lividomycin, whereas apramycin preferentially formed a complex with the eukaryotic subdomain. We show that differences in binding between paromomycin and ribostamycin can be probed by using an MS–MS protection assay. We have introduced specific base substitutions in the RNA models and have measured their impact on binding affinity and selectivity. The binding of apramycin to the prokaryotic subdomain strongly depends on the identity of position 1408, as evidenced by the selective increase in affinity for an A 1408 G mutant. An A 1409 –G 1491 mismatch pair in the prokaryotic subdomain enhanced the binding of tobramycin and <b>bekanamycin.</b> These observations demonstrate the power of MS-based methods to provide molecular insights into small molecule/RNA interactions useful in the design of selective new antimicrobial drugs...|$|E
40|$|Equinatoxin II (EqT II) {{is a basic}} 20 kD protein {{isolated}} from the sea anemone Actinia equina. Intravenous injection of 3 LD 50 of EqT II causes cardiorespiratory arrest. The aim of our study was to check the effects of EqT II on neuronal cells to assess the role of neuronal mechanisms in respiratory arrest after intravenous injection of the toxin. Effects of EqT II on mouse neuroblastoma x rat glioma NG 108 - 15 cell were studied using confocal laser scanning microscopy and by Fura- 2 fluorescence measurements. The results show that EqT II applied in nanomolar range increases intracellular Ca 2 + activity significantly, which is possibly responsible for the morphological changes of NG 108 - 15 cells after the exposure to 10 nM EqT II. Intracellular increase in Ca 2 + activity can not be prevented by use of the various pharmacological substances (e. g. Ca 2 + channels blocker Verapamil and <b>Bekanamycin).</b> Swelling of the NG 108 - 15 cells after the exposure to the EqT II also can not be blocked with the sodium channel blocker tetrodotoxin. Increase in the intracellular Ca 2 + activity is probably a result of Ca 2 + entry through pores produced by the toxin, which has been shown by other authors on other cells and on phospholipid bilayer. Respiratory arrest after intravenous injection of the toxin {{can be caused by}} the action of the toxin on neuronal cells in medulla oblongata provided that EqT II can damage blood brain barrier thus enabling access to the neuronal cells. The results allow the conclusion that EqT II can affect normal calcium homeostasis and cell morphology of neuronal cells that can disturb cell physiology and its function thus affecting normal respiratory pattern...|$|E
