5000|$|As {{opposed to}} a {{supercharger}} driven by the engine itself, a turbocharger is driven using the otherwise wasted exhaust gas from the engine. The amount {{of power in the}} gas is proportional to the difference between the exhaust pressure and air pressure, and this difference increases with altitude, helping a turbocharged engine to compensate for changing altitude. This increases the height at which maximum power output of the engine is attained compared to supercharger boosting, and allows better fuel consumption at high altitude compared to an equivalently powered supercharged engine. This facilitates increased true airspeed at high altitude and gives a greater operational range than an equivalently <b>boosted</b> <b>engine</b> using a supercharger.|$|E

5000|$|An uprated, {{turbocharged}} {{version of}} the 1.6 L which was developed by Ford Europe for the hugely popular RS Turbo {{version of the}} Escort and also later the Ford Fiesta RS Turbo. It made [...] at 6,000 rpm, and 133 ftlbf Nm of torque at a very tractable 3,000 rpm. The <b>boosted</b> <b>engine</b> was substantially smoother than its normally aspirated cousins, the forced induction helping to damp out unpleasant harmonics. The block was slightly modified to provide an oil return from the turbocharger. Crankshaft and connecting rods were identical to the lesser 1.6 L models, but the Mahle pistons were unique to the RS Turbo. These are manufactured using a pressure cast method, which makes them considerably stronger and {{more expensive than the}} normal cast pistons. The pistons dropped the compression ratio to 8.3:1, allowing the use of large amounts of boost pressure. The standard engine only needs 7 psi (=0,48 bar) of boost to produce its quoted power output, and is considered to be detuned from the factory. Because of its strength and detuned nature, tuners continue to increase the standard figures by more than 100% for a relatively reasonable fee. Even today, some 20 years after its release, new ways are being developed to extract even more performance.|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} this study is the {{trade-off}} between fuel economy and transient performance in turbocharged engines. It quantifies the losses and gains of different engine control strategies. Two extreme strategies are analyzed, one for optimal fuel economy and the other for fast transient response. Models for the components that influence the fuel economy are developed and described. An optimization problem for best fuel economy is solved analytically and a fuel-optimal controller is implemented based on that result. This controller is compared to one which is optimized for fast transient response with respect to the gains in fuel economy and losses in transient response. Simulations of a highly <b>boosted</b> <b>engine</b> show that a fuel-optimal controller can improve the fuel economy of a vehicle operated at cruising speed by 1 - 3 % and at highway speed by 4 %, and that the highest achievable improvement is above 10 %. The losses in transient response are around 0. 4 s for cruising conditions. Furthermore, measurements on a low-boosted engine on a test bench are used to show that the fuel-optimal controller reduces fuel consumption by 1. 9 % at highway conditions...|$|E

40|$|Ethanol biofuel {{could play}} an {{important}} role in reducing petroleum consumption by enabling a substantial increase in the fuel efficiency of gasoline engine vehicles. This ethanol <b>boosted</b> <b>engine</b> concept uses a small amount ethanol to increase the efficiency of use of a much larger amount of gasoline by approximately 30 %. Gasoline consumption and the corresponding CO 2 emissions would thereby be reduced by approximately 25 %. In combination with the additional reduction that results from the substitution of ethanol for gasoline as a fuel, the overall reduction in gasoline consumption and CO 2 emissions is greater than 30 %. The concept uses appropriately controlled direct injection of ethanol into the engine cylinders. The direct injection provides suppression of engine knock at high pressure. This allows high pressure operation of a much smaller, highly turbocharged engine with the same performance as a larger engine. The engine can also use a higher compression ratio. The engine downsizing and higher compression ratio results in a large increase in fuel efficiency. This approach involves only modest changes to the present gasoline engine systems and fueling infrastructure. The increase in vehicle cost could be modest (approximately $ 600) and the fuel savings payback time could be approximately 2 years. This leveraged use of ethanol to increase gasoline engine efficiency could substantially increase its energy value and help to alleviate concerns about a low energy output / input ratio (energy provided by the ethanol/energy needed to produce the ethanol). Thus the ethanol boosting concept can facilitate increased use of biofuel in addition to providing a cost-effective way to increase gasoline engine efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Increasing {{environmental}} constraints {{have led to}} a corresponding increase in engine complexity. As a result there is more of a requirement to fully understand and manage the task of hardware selection and engine optimization. Traditionally undertaking these tasks in either experimental or simulation environments would be highly time and cost inefficient and iterative. A technique is developed whereby data is merged {{from a variety of sources}} thus reducing the aforementioned problems whilst still retaining high system knowledge. Technologies relating to engine downsizing are focused on since it has been identified as one of the more promising methods in meeting future CO 2 constraints. Engine downsizing is a smaller highly <b>boosted</b> <b>engine</b> performing the same role of a larger engine with reduced heat and frictional losses. In order to address these issues this research develops a range of techniques that enable technologies such as high boost, variable valve actuation (WA), variable compression ratio (VCR) and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) to be evaluated as part of the overall powertrain optimization process. A novel experimental data merging process proved to be the most successful method and showed improved accuracy over simulation studies, particularly with reference to NOx and BSFC. As part of the experimental work in capturing high boost data a novel charge air handling unit is employed. This emulates the effects of boosting hardware as opposed to having to develop prototype hardware itself. The advantage is it can operate outside the production envelope and is thus capable of emulating a variety of current and future boosting strategies. Within this research the charge air handling unit reaches 2 bar boost irrespective of engine speed, although there is capacity to go up to 3 bar with a reduced compression ratio engine and uprated gaskets. Further development of the technique at full load will give the automotive engineer an invaluable tool to make informed powertrain selection choices early in the development cycle, thus reducing cost and potential problems at later stages.

40|$|Governments {{across the}} world are {{implementing}} legislation for ever more strict limits for vehicle emissions; combined with customer expectations for growing levels of performance and equipment, automotive manufacturers face a significant challenge. With the aim of meeting this challenge, downsizing is an established trend in passenger car engine development. However, since downsizing is commonly achieved through pressure charging (turbocharging, for example), the associated benefits in improved fuel economy and emissions are often obtained {{at the expense of}} engine dynamic response, and, consequently, vehicle driveability. This thesis presents predominantly simulation-based research into a novel combined charging system comprising a conventional turbocharger used in conjunction with a declutchable supercharger driven through a CVT. An initial investigation using this system in place of a variable geometry turbocharger on an already downsized passenger car diesel engine demonstrated greatly increased low speed torque as well as improved dynamic response. A downsizing project that involved replacing a naturally aspirated gasoline engine with a highly <b>boosted</b> <b>engine</b> with 40 % of the original displacement formed the basis for more extensive investigations. Although it was unable to produce the low speed transient response of the naturally aspirated engine, in tip-in tests the CVT-supercharger system was shown to achieve the target torque much quicker than an equivalent system with a fixed supercharger drive ratio. However, balancing this with good fuel efficiency for the initial part load period was a complex trade-off. In vehicle acceleration simulations the CVT-supercharger system did not outperform the fixed drive ratio configuration, but on the CVT system the boost limit was reached at an early stage during the transients. Thus there may be potential to include an ‘over-boost’ facility, allowing boost pressure to temporarily exceed normal steady state limits in order to improve transient performance and bring it closer to that of the baseline vehicle. It is suggested that the CVT-supercharger provides the best flexibility for calibration and compromise between performance and fuel efficiency, perhaps incorporating different user-selectable modes (such as ‘economy’ and ‘sport’ modes) ...|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} {{different}} {{internal and external}} EGR strategies, combined with extreme Miller cycles, were analyzed {{by means of a}} one dimensional CFD simulation code for a Wartsila 6 cylinder, 4 strokes, medium speed marine diesel engine, to evaluate their potential in order to reach the IMO Tier 3 NOx emissions target. By means of extreme Miller cycles, with Early Intake Valve Closures (EIVC up to 100 crank angle degrees before BDC), a shorter compression stroke and lower charge temperatures inside the cylinder can be achieved and thanks to the cooler combustion process, the NOx specific emissions can be effectively reduced. EIVC strategies can also be combined with reductions of the scavenging period (valve overlap) {{to increase the amount of}} exhaust gases in the combustion chamber. However, the remarkably high boost pressure levels needed for such extreme Miller cycles, require mandatorily the use of two stage turbocharging systems. Despite two stages turbocharging, combined with extreme Miller timings, may allow up to 50 % NOx reduction compared to a conventional, single stage turbocharger architecture, further NOx emissions reductions are necessary to meet the IMO Tier 3 NOx limit. Higher EGR percentages, which could be achieved by means of external circuits, were therefore also evaluated. However, it should be pointed out that, although the external EGR technology is well established for automotive and heavy duty diesel engines, it is not yet state of the art for marine diesel engines, and its application to a highly <b>boosted</b> <b>engine</b> using extreme Miller timings is not straightforward. Several different complex EGR routes were thus investigated, and for the preliminary assessment of their NOx emissions abatement potentialities, the use of numerical simulation allowed a detailed and extensive evaluation of the effects on engine performance, fuel consumption, NOx emissions and thermal and mechanical loads on engine components of the combination of different intake valve profiles, intake valve closure timings and scavenging periods with different external exhaust gas recirculation solutions. Percentages of exhaust gases recirculated in the combustion chamber up to 20 % were evaluated that combined with extreme Miller timings (up to 100 crank angle degrees before BDC) allowed up to 90 % NOx reduction compared to a conventional, single stage turbocharger architecture, with only moderate BSFC increas...|$|E
40|$|Direct {{injection}} {{spark ignition}} (DISI) engines are {{the next generation}} of gasoline fuelled engines. Their greater fuel economy and reduced CO 2 emissions compared with port fuel injection (PFI) engines has led to their popularity. However, DISI engines produce a greater number of particulate matter (PM) emissions than PFI engines. Concern over the health effects of PM emissions, and forthcoming European legislation to regulate them from gasoline powered vehicles has led to an increased interest in the study of PM formation, measurement, and characterisation. A model was developed by Aikawa et al, the PM index, correlating PM emissions with fuel composition. PM emissions are thought to be linked both to the vapour pressure (VP) and the double bond equivalent (DBE) of the components of the fuel. However, there was no independent control of these parameters and the study was undertaken on a PFI engine. In this thesis, experiments have been conducted to validate this model and extend it, as the PN index, to DISI engines. Fuels have been designed using Raoult’s law and UNIFAC (with careful consideration of octane number) such that the DBE and VP of the fuel mix could be varied independently. The design of the fuels was such that the component parts would co-evaporate upon injection into the cylinder, ensuring a homogeneous mixture of the components at the point of ignition. The PN index has been tested on a single cylinder engine, at a matrix of test points, using these model fuels, and their PM emissions have been analysed using a Cambustion DMS 500. The results show that the PN index is followed closely using model fuels, provided that these model fuels contain a ‘light-end’ (in this case 5  % v/v n-pentane). Imaging of in-cylinder evaporation and in-cylinder measurement of hydrocarbons shows how the composition of model fuels affects their PM emissions. The PN index has also been tested using commercial fuels on a single cylinder engine and a Jaguar V 8 engine; the results again show that the PN index is also an excellent predictor of PN emissions for market fuels from both of these engines. PN emissions have been evaluated from two fuels representing the EU 5 reference fuel specification, developed using the PN index to give a difference in PM emissions. Testing these fuels on both a single cylinder engine and a Jaguar V 8 engine has shown up to a factor of three variation in observed PN emissions. This has important implications for forthcoming European emissions legislation. The results of these tests were fed into the recommendations for the EU 6 reference fuel specification. The PN index has also been investigated in a Jaguar V 6 engine with five different fuels with a spread of calculated PN indices over a simulated NEDC. Here the PN emissions have been measured using two PN, and one PM instrument and the results compared. The results show that the trends of the PN index are followed, but not as closely as predicted. Detailed analysis shows that this discrepancy is due to other effects, for example cold start, dominating the PN emissions in certain phases. PN emissions have been measured from a highly <b>boosted</b> <b>engine</b> at a variety of operating points using 14 different fuels. It has been shown that for a large variety of engine operating parameters PN emissions from highly boosted engines behave as expected. When changing the fuels, the results show that a variation of over three orders of magnitude can be observed. The predictions of the PN index are inconclusive however, with further work suggested to fully evaluate the PN index on highly boosted engines. This thesis is not currently available on ORA...|$|E
