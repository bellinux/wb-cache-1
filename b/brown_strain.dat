The both strains of H. mermoreus love medium temperature and the mycelial growth was well developed at 20 – 25 ℃. This mushroom prefer pH ranging 6 – 8 for mycelial growth. The highest and lowest mycelial growth was found at pH 7 and 5 of both strains, respectively. Among 5 different carbon sources, sucrose was the best, whereas, maltose and lactose were the worst. The most suitable nitrogen sources were CaNO 3 (in <b>brown</b> <b>strain</b> 65. 6 mm and in white strain 56. 3 mm) and the most unsuitable was NH_ 4 H_ 2 PO_ 4 (in <b>brown</b> <b>strain</b> 44. 02 mm and in white strain 40. 2 mm). Five different culture media were used to screen the optimal mycelial growth of H. marmoreus.

The fact that the red strain exhibited the highest growth at both depths indicates {{that it is better}} adapted to the environmental conditions of the shrimp ponds. The performance of this strain may be associated with intrinsic genetic characteristics that result in different metabolic characteristics. In general, the red strain has a higher concentration of protein and phycoerythrin (Yokoya et al. 2007). These two components {{play an important role in}} nitrogen storage, and are the primary pools of metabolized nitrogen when environmental nitrogen concentrations are reduced. Moreover, the fact that the red strain synthesizes more phycoerythrin makes it more competitive in capturing solar energy and performing photosynthesis (Pereira et al. 2012).

40|$|White (Lohmann LSL) and Brown (ATAK-S) laying hens, were reared under {{organic and}} {{conventional}} cage rearing systems, {{and the effects}} of the rearing system on performance parameters, egg production, egg characteristics, and immune response were investigated. For this purpose, a total of 832 laying hens of two commercial hybrids, i. e., 416 white (Lohmann LSL) and 416 Brown (ATAK-S) layers, were used. The experiment lasted between 23 and 70 wk of age. In this study, the white layers yielded more eggs as compared to the brown layers in both organic and conventional production systems. Egg weight exhibited a similar pattern to that of laying performance. However, the total hen-housed egg number for the white birds in the organic system was fewer than that of white birds in the conventional cage facility; conversely, a contradictory tendency was observed for the brown birds. Livability of the white layers in the organic system was remarkably lower (14 %) than that of the brown line, whereas the white line survived better (3. 42 %) than their brown counterparts in conventional cages. The feed conversion ratio of the white hens was markedly inferior in the organic system as compared to that of the white hens in the conventional system, whereas relatively lower deterioration was reported in brown layers when reared in an organic system. The organic production system increased egg albumen height and the Haugh unit in eggs of the brown layers. The yolk color score of organic eggs was lower than that of conventional eggs for both brown and white hens. The egg yolk ratio of eggs from white layers was found to be higher in organic eggs as compared to those obtained in the conventional system. All organic eggs had heavier shells than those produced in the conventional system. Eggs from brown layers had more protein content than eggs from white layers. Neither housing systems nor genotype influenced egg yolk cholesterol concentration. When compared to conventional eggs, n- 3 fatty acid content was lower in organic eggs, and the n- 6 :n- 3 ratio was higher in organic eggs. In conclusion, two hen genotypes showed different responses in terms of performance and egg quality to two different rearing systems. A commercial white strain produced more eggs with higher egg quality as compared to a native <b>brown</b> <b>strain.</b> The <b>brown</b> <b>strain</b> was found to have adapted well to organic production conditions when survival and total egg number was taken into consideration...|$|E
40|$|Wood ear {{mushrooms}} [Auricularia auricula (L. ex Hook.) Underw. ] {{native to}} Kenya were cultivated on composted and non composted agro-wastes. The wastes included maize cobs, sawdust, sugarcane baggase grass straw and wheat straw each supplemented with wheat or rice bran at {{a ratio of}} 80 : 20. Both the composted and non composted substrates and supplements were nutritionally analyzed to determine their lignin, ash, cellulose, crude protein and moisture content. The cultivation experiment was arranged in a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) and replicated three times. Data was collected on days to pinning, fruit body quality, fruit body yield (fresh weight) and biological efficiency. The data collected was subjected to analysis of variance using SAS version 9. 1. Mean separation was done using LSD and effects declared significant at 5 % level. The substrates and supplements were significantly (p< 0. 05) different in their nutritional content with maize cobs and wheat bran containing higher cellulose, crude protein and moisture content. Remarkably, the dark <b>brown</b> <b>strain</b> had significantly (p< 0. 05) higher productivity factors on composted maize cobs supplemented with wheat bran. Saw dust and rice bran gave significantly the lowest growth performance on all the strains...|$|E

(body temperature) a relation of frequency of breathing movements to temperature such that when fitted by the Arrhenius equation the data give a value for the constant µ of 24, 000 ± calories or, less frequently, 28, 000 ±. Young mice of an inbred albino strain show over the range 15 – 20 °C. a value of µ = 34, 000 ±, or, less frequently, 14, 000 ±, with a critical temperature at about 20 °C. and a value of µ = 14, 000 ± above 20 °C. The F 1 hybrids of these two strains, and the backcross generations to either parent strain, exhibit only those four values of the temperature characteristic observed in the parent strains and none other. One may therefore speak of the inheritance {{of the value of}} the constant µ, but the inheritance shows in this instance no Mendelian behavior. Furthermore there appears to be inherited the occurrence (or absence) of a critical temperature at 20 °C. These experiments indicate the "biological reality" of the temperature characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Hy-Line W 98, W 36, and Brown hens {{are among}} the most popular strains for {{commercial}} egg production. It is of interest to evaluate the differences in performance of old hens of each variety. As part of a larger study, hens of the three varieties were maintained under production longer than 100 weeks of age and hens of each strain were randomly selected for in vitro calcium uptake (CaT) by duodenal cells. Blood samples were collected 4 - 6 hours prior to oviposition via brachial vein cannulation for plasma estrogen (E), 2 Luteinizing hormone (LH), and progesterone (P) determination. Hens were then euthanatized by cervical 4 dislocation and CaT determined. The data were analyzed as a completely randomized design, using the General Linear Model procedure (SAS, Proc GLM, 2001), with strain as a fixed treatment and hen as the experimental unit nested with strain. For W 36 hens, CaT was significantly greater than that found in Brown hens (P= 0. 05) while for W 98 did not differ from W 36 and <b>Brown</b> <b>strains.</b> P, E and LH concentrations were 4 2 not significantly different in the three varieties of laying hens. Based on the higher CaT by duodenal cells, these results suggest a higher efficiency of the W 36 hens in calcium regulation during the terminal phase of egg production (more than 100 weeks of age) compared to the Brown and W 98 hens. However, when specific gravity and thickness of shells were compared, the W 36 appeared to have no advantage over W 98 (P= 0. 460 and 0. 684) or Brown (P= 0. 197 and 0. 941) hens, respectively.

The lakes have been test-fished yearly. The catches show good survival in 8 lakes, with fish growing to 25 - 30 cm {{at the age}} of 3 +. The K-factor was high and the gonadal development normal. No single chemical factor can explain the occurrence or absence of fish in the lakes. The ability to support fish seems to be lake specific, and determined by pH, calcium and/or aluminium. The use of local "acid tolerant" strains is proposed as a supplement to other acid warer mitigating techniques. Joint Environmental Programme of PowerGen and National Power (UK...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} a 3 × 7 {{factorial}} arrangement of 3 lysine levels (0. 917, 0. 828 and 0. 747) and seven commercial <b>brown</b> egg layer <b>strains.</b> The objective of this experiment {{was to determine the}} effect of increasing dietary lysine on performance, egg composition, egg solids, egg quality and profits in seven commercial <b>brown</b> egg layer <b>strains</b> and to determine the lysine requirement during phase one (from 21 - 36 wk of age). This experiment lasted 16 weeks. Seven strains of hens (n = 240 of each strain) at 21 week of age were randomly divided into 21 treatments (8 replicates of 10 birds/treatment). The results showed that there were no interactions between lysine and strain on any parameter. Lysine had significant effects on egg weight, egg mass, feed conversion, percent albumen solids, yolk color, shell color, albumen weight, egg shell and albumen components. There were significant strain effects on egg production, feed consumption, egg weight, egg mass, feed conversion, specific gravity, yolk weight, shell color, shell, albumen and yolk components, yolk, albumen and whole egg solids. Strain 1 had the best overall performance. All strains peaked in production over 94 % and were laying 94 - 96 % at 36 weeks of age. Average egg weight (21 - 36 wk) was 60. 3 g, varying from 59. 0 - 62. 8 g between strains. Average feed intake was 112. 3 g/hen/day varying from 109. 6 - 116. 7 g/hen/day between strains. Average egg weight of hens fed diets containing the highest lysine level was 2. 04 g heavier than the hens fed the diets containing the lowest lysine level. Increasing dietary lysine from 0. 747 - 0. 917 % significantly improved feed conversion from 2. 20 - 2. 06 g feed/g egg and increased egg mass from 51. 8 - 54. 32 g/hen/day. Average lysine intake of hens fed 0. 917 % level was 1023 mg/hen/day varying from 1005 - 1070 mg/hen/day between strains. Because egg prices and ingredient prices often change, there can be no fixed dietary lysine level for optimal profits.
