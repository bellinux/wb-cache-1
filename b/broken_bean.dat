40|$|Pulping is one {{important}} step in wet coffee processing method. Pulping process usually uses a machine which constructed by wood or metal materials. A horizontal single cylinder type of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine {{is the most popular}} machine in coffee processing. One of the weaknesses of a horizontal single cylinder type of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine is higher in broken beans. <b>Broken</b> <b>bean</b> is one of mayor aspects in defect system that contribute to low quality. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed and tested a horizontal double cylinder type of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine which resulted in 12. 6 — 21. 4 % of broken beans. To reduce percentage of broken beans, Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has developed and tested a horizontal triple cylinder type of fresh coffee cherries pulping machine. Material tested was fresh mature Robusta coffee cherries, 60 — 65 % (wet basis) moisture content; has classified on 3 levels i. e. unsorted, small and medium, and clean from metal and foreign materials.

40|$|Coffee {{consumers}} {{request a}} good quality of green coffee {{to get a}} good coffee cup taste. Defective beans e. g. black bean, brown bean and <b>broken</b> <b>bean</b> are associated to low coffee quality which give negative effects to final taste. To meet the standard export requirement, coffee beans have to be graded before being traded. Until now, grading process is generally carried out manually. The method gives better product, so the grading cost is very expensive about 40 % of total processing cost. Meanwhile, shortage of skill workers is a limiting factor of the process. Therefore, improving the manual sorting by providing machine for grading of green coffee is good alternative to reduce the grading cost. Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute has designed a table conveyor type grading machine in order to improve the performance of the manual grading productivity and consistent quality and to reduce the grading cost. The conveyor belt has a dimension of 5700 mm of length, 610 mm of width and 6 mm of thickness. The rotating of belt conveyor powered by an electro motor 3 HP, 3 phase and 1420 rpm. The result showed that the optimum capacity of grading machine was 390 kg/hour reached when the speed 16 rpm and 3 kg/m 2 of green beans on belt conveyor with productivity 1870 kg/man-day compared to the productivity full manually process 743 kg/man-day.

The product was elaborated with a rice and common bean mixed flour, using the proportion of 70 % broken rice flour and 30 % of <b>broken</b> common <b>bean</b> flour. The tested formulation was processed in a single-screw extruder. The extrusion parameters were set using three extrusion zones with temperatures of 40 °C (1 st zone), 60 °C (2 nd zone) e 80 °C (3 rd zone); mixture moisture during processing set at 14 %; screw speed set at 177 rpm; feeding rate of 290 g/minute and circular matrix of 3. 85 mm. The developed breakfast cereal was sprinkled with a sufficient quantity of a 70 ºBrix sucrose solution to make a final product with approximately 35 % sugar. The processed formulation was manually collected, submitted to a forced air circulation oven drying and, afterwards, it was stored in polyethylene bags until analyses. The extruded obtained showed relatively low values for water absorption index (6. 41 g gel/g dry matter) and high values for water solubility index (44. 50 %). The expansion index of breakfast cereal was 8. 89 indicating a good expansion of the final product. For apparent density it was observed the value of 0. 25 and for instrumental texture evaluation, the value of 1, 087. 44 g. The paste viscosity is an important attribute to study the functional properties of starchy food. Severe treatments destroy the starch granular structure, reducing the paste viscosity, what can be observed in this work through viscosity values below 130 cP. It can be concluded that the use of <b>broken</b> common <b>bean</b> and rice mixed flour is an alternative to elaborate extruded breakfast cereal with good technological properties. 201...|$|R

Measurements {{were made}} on yields, bean characteristics, {{specific}} leaf area, leaf temperature, leaf nutrient levels, nodal growth, organoleptic quality and photosynthetic response. Brewed coffee samples were analyzed using solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography to capture and analyze brewed coffee volatiles. These volatiles were used topredict organoleptic quality and group membership based on location, year of harvest and shade treatment. In addition, application of kaolin was explored using glass plates and slides to determine coverage and light transmittance. Shading did not appreciably affect organoleptic quality. Furthermore, brewed coffee volatiles were not good predictors of organoleptic quality. However, with few to no misclassifications, the volatiles could accurately predict group membership. Shading resulted in statistically different yields in the macadamia (16 % of sun) and kaolin (199 % of sun) treatments {{in the second year}}, although a negative, linear trend was observed with increased shading. The lack of significant differences in yields between the cloth shaded and sun treatments was likely a result of large yield variation. Bean sizes were generally larger in shaded treatments and only the percentage of defects and <b>broken</b> <b>beans</b> were lower for the kaolin treatment in the second year in Kunia. Kona bean sizes were larger in the sun treatment but no differences were observed in bean characteristics.

To explore the effects of shade level and type on coffee in Hawai'i, Coffea arabica L. was shaded with varying degrees of black and aluminized shade cloth, macadamia trees, and a novel, spray-on shade composed mostly of kaolin. These treatments were compared to unshaded coffee. Two locations were used in this experiment: Kunia, O'ahu and Kona, Hawai'i.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} {{of the development of}} a dedicated cacaoterminal in the port of Abidjan, Ivory Coast. The port of Abidjan is the most important port in West Africa. The port handles about 15 million tons of cargo a year. One of the main export products is cacao. The developments in the cacao industry are mainly dictated by the biggest importer of cacao, the Port of Amsterdam. As a supplier Abidjan has to follow the developments in order to deliver the cacao according to the client's requirements. The last ten years represented a shift in the cacao shipping. While in former days the cacao was transported as general cargo, in gunnysacks on pallets, nowadays it is also possible to transport the cacao as bulk good (bulk containers or megabulk). This study consists of two parts. The first part investigates how the Port of Abidjan can seize up on to these developments and which port facilities are necessary for a dedicated cacao terminal. As cacao is a seasonal good, the cacao throughput varies throughout the year. In order to create a sufficient return on investment this variation is an important factor. The quality preservation of the cacao beans during the whole transport chain is very important. Criteria as moisture, sweat (precipitation of moisture on <b>beans</b> during shipping) <b>broken</b> <b>beans</b> and heating, what can cause fire, are of importance. The second part investigates the accessibility through the "Canal de Virdi", which all entering in the port ships have to pass. In order to receive the larger vessels nautical adjustments to the present port entrance are necessary. Some rigorous alternatives to increase the accessibility of the channel were proposed. It concerned alternatives that provide unconditional entrance for the above mentioned vessels. For this purpose it is proposed to replace the entire eastern breakwater in order to broaden the entrance. This is a very rigorous and expensive solution. Besides the alternatives disregard the special design of the channel mouth. It was designed to avoid the formation of a sand bar near the entrance. The shape of the entrance was specially studied for at one hand to create a maximal flushing effect of the channel {{and on the other hand}} to maintain a prevailing ebb current over the flood current. HASKONING has studied the issue and has proposed a low cost solution, which keeps the channel mouth itself unimpaired but creates a manoeuvring space directly inside the channel. The navigability should be improved, as ships will have more space and time after the narrow entrance to adjust their course and get in line with the channel's axis.
