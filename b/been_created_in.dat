5|$|Garter is {{ex officio}} the officer of {{arms of the}} Order of the Garter, England's senior Order of Chivalry. The post of Secretary of the Order had <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> the early 20th century and had been held by courtiers since then, not always in {{friendly}} relations with other officers. In 1952, Bellew {{and most of the}} chapter came to an agreement that a herald be appointed to the post; after appealing to Sir Alan Lascelles, the Sovereign's Private Secretary, the Queen agreed and Anthony Wagner was given the position.|$|E

5|$|The Pipeline Hazardous Material Safety Administration (PHMSA) is {{responsible}} for developing and enforcing regulations for pipeline operation transportation having <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> 2004 within the United States Department of Transportation. In the months following the spill, {{they found that the}} in-line inspection tool used by Plains in Line 901 and Line 903 had miscalculated the degree of corrosion. The company also withheld in-line inspection data so “it could enhance its interpretation of the data,” according to a corrective order issued by PHMSA. In October, PHMSA proposed new rules to assist in preventing such inspection discrepancies.|$|E

5|$|The Real Estate Committee almost {{immediately}} purchased land located on Avenue L between East 26th and 27th Streets. Most members, however, felt a location on Ocean Avenue {{would be more}} desirable. Issues arose with developing the land on Avenue L, and in 1925 the Committee purchased the current location at 1625 Ocean Avenue in Midwood, Brooklyn. The cornerstone was laid in 1926, and, although not complete, the building was fully enclosed by the autumn, and High Holiday services were held there that year. The Center's Talmud Torah, which had <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> 1925 and held in a temporary structure, also moved into the new building.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of several {{high-profile}} reports about hunger and malnutrition in the United States, the Senate Select Committee on Nutrition and Human Needs had <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> July 1968, with McGovern as its chair. Seeking to dramatize the problem, in March 1969 McGovern took the committee to Immokalee, Florida, the base for 20,000 migrant farm workers. They saw graphic examples of hunger and malnutrition firsthand, but also encountered resistance and complaints about bad publicity from local and state officials. McGovern battled the Nixon administration and Southerners in Congress {{during much of the}} next year over an expanded Food Stamp Program; he had to compromise on a number of points, but legislation signed in 1970 established the principles of free food stamps and a nationwide standard for eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Livermorium is a {{synthetic}} chemical element with symbol Lv and atomic number 116. It {{is an extremely}} radioactive element that has only <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> the laboratory {{and has not been}} observed in nature. The element is named after the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the United States, which collaborated with the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in Dubna, Russia to discover livermorium during experiments made between 2000 and 2006. The name of the laboratory refers to the city of Livermore, California where it is located, which in turn was named after the rancher and landowner Robert Livermore. The name was adopted by IUPAC on May 30, 2012. Four isotopes of livermorium are known, with mass numbers between 290 and 293 inclusive; the longest-lived among them is livermorium-293 with a half-life of about 60milliseconds. A fifth isotope with mass number 294 has been reported but not yet confirmed.|$|E

5|$|Scottish {{religion}} {{in the eighteenth century}} includes all forms of religious organisation and belief in Scotland in the eighteenth century. This period saw the beginnings of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> the Reformation and established on a fully Presbyterian basis after the Glorious Revolution. These fractures were prompted by issues of government and patronage, but reflected a wider division between the Evangelicals and the Moderate Party. The legal right of lay patrons to present clergymen of their choice to local ecclesiastical livings led to minor schisms from the church. The first in 1733, known as the First Secession and headed by figures including Ebenezer Erskine, {{led to the creation of}} a series of secessionist churches. The second in 1761 led to the foundation of the independent Relief Church.|$|E
5|$|The CL had {{situational}} playoff scenarios {{written into}} its bylaws that required either a tie {{in the standings}} or a team with more wins finishing with a worse winning percentage than the top team, but a permanent playoff plan had never <b>been</b> <b>created.</b> <b>In</b> March 2006, encouraged {{by the success of}} the PL's playoff series, CL officials announced their intention to introduce postseason playoffs for the 2007 season to help boost declining attendance. During meetings held later that year, PL and CL officials disagreed over proposed plans detailing the new playoff system. Since the creation of the PL playoffs in 2004, the league awarded its pennant titles to the playoff winners rather than the team who finished the regular season with the best record. The PL disapproved of the CL's intentions to continue awarding their league title to the first-place finisher in the regular season while using the playoffs to determine which team would compete against in the Japan Series, as the PL had been awarding its pennant to its playoff champion.|$|E
5|$|The Dean of St Patrick's Cathedral was {{originally}} the Registrar of the Order. In 1890, {{on the death}} of the Dean who had held the post in at the time of disestablishment, the office was attached to that of the King of Arms of the Order. This position was held by Ulster King of Arms, Ireland's chief heraldic official, a post which had <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> 1552. In 1943, this post was in effect divided in two, reflecting the partition of Ireland in the Government of Ireland Act 1920. The position, insofar as it related to Northern Ireland, was combined with that of Norroy King of Arms (who had heraldic jurisdiction in the north of England). The post of Norroy and Ulster King of Arms still exists, and thus continues to hold the offices of Registrar and King of Arms of the Order of St Patrick. The office of Ulster King of Arms, insofar as it related to the Irish Free State (now officially called Ireland), became the position of Chief Herald of Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The HGZ {{took part}} in several battles of the Croatian War of Independence and the Bosnian War. In late November and December 1994, it participated in Operation Winter '94, the joint {{offensive}} of the HV and the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO) which pushed the Army of Republika Srpska (Vojska Republike Srpske – VRS) from the western parts of the Livanjsko field in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Elements of the HGZ also saw action along the Novska–Okučani axis of advance in the HV's Operation Flash offensive {{that took place in}} western Slavonia in early May 1995. By this time, the HGZ also commanded its own artillery and Mil Mi-24 helicopter gunships, in addition to Mil Mi-8 transport helicopters. The HGZ redeployed west of Livno once again in early June to take part in Operation Leap 2, extending the salient that had <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> late 1994 west towards Bosansko Grahovo and Glamoč. The unit participated in the capture of those towns in late July 1995 during Operation Summer '95.|$|E
5|$|The name Book of Kells {{is derived}} from the Abbey of Kells in Kells, County Meath, which was its home for much of the medieval period. The manuscript's date and place of {{production}} {{have been the subject of}} considerable debate. Traditionally, the book was thought to have <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> the time of Columba, possibly even as the work of his own hands. This tradition has long been discredited on paleographic and stylistic grounds: most evidence points to a composition date 800, long after St. Columba's death in 597. The proposed dating in the 9th century coincides with Viking raids on Iona, which began in 794 and eventually dispersed the monks and their holy relics into Ireland and Scotland. There is another tradition, with some traction among Irish scholars, that suggests the manuscript was created for the 200th anniversary of the saint's death.|$|E
5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Turkey is characterised by achievements and challenges. Over the past decades access to drinking water {{has become almost}} universal and access to adequate sanitation has also increased substantially. Autonomous utilities have <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> the 16 metropolitan cities of Turkey and cost recovery has been increased, thus providing {{the basis for the}} sustainability of service provision. Intermittent supply, which was common in many cities, has become less frequent. In 2004, 61% of the wastewater collected through sewers was being treated. Remaining challenges include the need to further increase wastewater treatment, to reduce the high level of non-revenue water hovering around 50% and to expand access to adequate sanitation in rural areas. The investment required to comply with EU standards in the sector, especially in wastewater treatment, is estimated to be in the order of €2 billion per year, more than double the current level of investment.|$|E

5|$|When the Curule Aedileship {{had been}} created, {{it had only}} been opened to Patricians. Eventually, however, Plebeians won full {{admission}} to the Curule Aedileship. In addition, after the Consulship had been opened to the Plebeians, the Plebeians acquired a de facto right to hold both the Roman Dictatorship and the Roman Censorship (which had <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> 443 BC) since only former Consuls could hold either office. 356 BC saw the appointment of the first Plebeian Dictator, and in 339 BC the Plebeians facilitated {{the passage of a}} law (the lex Publilia), which required the election of at least one Plebeian Censor for each five-year term. In 337 BC, the first Plebeian Praetor was elected.|$|E
5|$|In 1155 {{the only}} English pope, Adrian IV, {{authorised}} King Henry II of England to {{take possession of}} Ireland as a feudal territory nominally under papal overlordship. The pope wanted the English monarch to annex Ireland and bring the Irish church into line with Rome, despite this process already underway in Ireland by 1155. An all-island kingship of Ireland had <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> 854 by Máel Sechnaill mac Máele Ruanaid. His last successor was Ruaidrí Ua Conchobair, who had become King of Ireland in early 1166, and exiled Diarmait Mac Murchada, King of Leinster. Diarmait asked Henry II for help, gaining a group of Anglo-Norman aristocrats and adventurers, led by Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, to help him regain his throne. Diarmait and his Anglo-Norman allies succeeded and he became King of Leinster again. De Clare married Diarmait's daughter, and when Diarmait died in 1171, de Clare became King of Leinster. Henry was afraid that de Clare would make Ireland a rival Norman kingdom, so he {{took advantage of the}} papal bull and invaded, forcing de Clare and the other Anglo-Norman aristocrats in Ireland and the major Irish kings and lords to recognise him as their overlord. English lords came close to colonising the entire island, but a Gaelic resurgence from the 1260s resulted in the island divided between Gaelic-Irish and Anglo-Irish lords by 1400. Many of the latter became completely Gaelicised, and did not recognise England's kings except perhaps nominally. Some, such as Manus O'Donnell and Conn O'Neill, 1st Earl of Tyrone, were kings themselves.|$|E
5|$|The first box {{lacrosse}} match {{conducted in}} Australia came about {{as part of}} a fund raising appeal for the Queen Victoria Hospital in Melbourne. The Victorian Lacrosse Association was approached by the appeal committee to stage a lacrosse match {{as part of a}} multi sport carnival at the Plaza (Wattle Path Palais) ballroom at St Kilda on 1 July 1931. After a lightning six-a-side (outdoor) tournament format was successfully carried out a few weeks prior, it was decided to play six-a-side for this exhibition game between MCC and a composite team from other clubs, with players wearing rubber shoes and using a softer ball for the match. Newspaper articles at the time suggest that the sport may have even <b>been</b> <b>created</b> <b>in</b> Australia, with P J Lally of the famous Canadian lacrosse stick manufacturing company requesting a copy of {{the rules of the game}} from the VLA Secretary. By 1933, box lacrosse matches were being played in Adelaide, Brisbane, and Perth. This new version of the game however did not overtake the traditional version of lacrosse in popularity in Australia as happened in Canada.|$|E
