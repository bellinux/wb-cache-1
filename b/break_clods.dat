50|$|The {{agreement}} was highly unfavourable to Henry and Edward, {{but it must}} be assumed that they agreed to it under duress, since Edward was held hostage by the barons after the defeat at Lewes. On 15 August the document was dispatched to King Louis IX of France, who previously had been acting as an arbiter between the two parties. Louis had already rejected the terms of the Mise of Lewes; the stricter conditions of the Peace of Canterbury might have been intended to bring pressure on the French king, to help bring about a settlement. King Louis, however, rejected the proposition in angry terms. He was reported to have said that he would rather <b>break</b> <b>clods</b> behind a plough than have this sort of kingly rule. Montfort's government after this gradually started running into problems. In the spring of 1265, Gloucester defected {{to the side of the}} royalists, and Edward managed to escape his captivity.

In this way it is distinct in its effect from the plough, which is used for deeper tillage. Harrowing is often carried out on fields to follow the rough finish left by plowing operations. The purpose of this harrowing is generally to <b>break</b> up <b>clods</b> (lumps of soil) and to provide a finer finish, a good tilth or soil structure that is suitable for seedbed use. Coarser harrowing may also be used to remove weeds and to cover seed after sowing.

The dynamic conditions of the soil were investigated in terms of physical soil properties. Having determined the variables to be measured, dimensional {{analysis was used to}} plan the experiments. Two variations were considered for each dependent variable (linear speed, working depth, and rotation velocity), totaling eight treatments, allotting in each an experimental strip with five data collection points. This arrangement totaled 16 experimental strips, with 80 data collection points for all variables. The rotary paraplow generates a trapezoidal furrow for planting with a very wide bottom and narrower at the top. The volumetric subsoiling action generates cracks {{on the sides of the}} band. Because of their specific geometry the blades of rotary paraplow generate a soil failure according to its natural crack angle, optimizing the energy use, while preserving the natural soil properties. Results showed the conservation character of the rotary paraplow, capable of <b>breaking</b> up <b>clods</b> for planting without changing the original physical soil properties...|$|R

Chepil (4) noted {{that some of the}} coaxse soil grains left loose on the surface following rainfall contributed to the ini-tial stages of wind erosion. Such coarse grains remain on the surface after dispersal of surface soil by raindrop impact and splash (3, 4). Crust formation associated with rainfall presumably would reduce wind erosion by increasing bulk density and lowering aggregation (8). Soil crust-ing is also associated with soil salinity (2, 3, 7, 9, 10). Wind erodibility of soiIs following rainstorms of various intensities and relatively short dura-tions have not been studied extensively. Little, if any, information exists on the influence of various salts on a soil's susceptibility to move-ment by wind.

The best kind of soil structure for plant growth is granular structure, which resembles cookie crumbs and is usually less than 0. 5 centimeter in diameter. One important soil property that can be easily overlooked is soil structure or tilth. Soil structure refers to the spatial arrangement of soil particles. These aggregates form through physical, chemical and biological processes, which will greatly influence soil quality (Brady and Weil, 2008). Good soil structure is a hallmark of healthy soil. If soils are healthy, then healthy turf can follow. An easy way to determine soil structure quality is to collect surface soil between 5 centimeters (cm) and 10 cm deep.

60|$|Again, As {{there is}} thus altar-work and temple-work {{to be done}} by the saints when they are coming out of spiritual Sodom and Egypt; so, at the end of these, there will be city-work on foot also. Which city-work will chiefly consist in setting up the wall and gates for defence, and of {{building}} themselves houses or mansions of rest and refreshment after all their hard usage under the tyranny of the man of sin, that son of perdition (Isa 65:19-21). Which city-work will be then completed, when the church of Christ hath obtained a complete conquest and victory over the world, and hath got her enemies and them that hate her, to lie at her feet, and to lick the dust of the soles thereof (Isa 60:14). For, as I have told you already, temple-work, yea, when that is complete in the work, yet there may be great havoc made of the church of Christ (Rev 11:1-3). At which time also, city-work may be trampled under the feet of the wicked and uncircumcised Gentiles; but when the city is built, then Zion is become a stronghold, and about all her glory shall be a defence (Isa 4:5). Then she either draweth and allureth her adversaries to entreat her kindly, and to count it their honour to be under her protection, as did the Gibeonites; or else she breaks, and bruises, and subjects them to her by her power and authority (Josh 9). 'The daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift, even the rich among the people shall entreat thy favour' (Psa 45:12). 'In the last days,' saith the prophet, 'it shall come to pass, that the mountain of the house of the Lord shall be established {{in the top of the}} mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and people shall flow unto it. And many nations shall come and say,--Let us go up unto the mountain of the Lord, and to the house of the God of Jacob, and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem. And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into plough-shares, and their spears into pruning-hooks'; that force and power that they used formerly to destroy the church of God, now they shall use it to do her service, even to <b>break</b> up the <b>clods</b> of the hearts of sinners, and to prune and dress the house of God, and vineyard of Jesus Christ; 'nation shall not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more'; for the word of the kingdom of peace shall bear sway. 'And thou, O tower of the flock, the stronghold of the daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem' (Micah 4:1-3,8). This is city-work, and as to the glory, peace, and deliverance of the church, it is the chiefest of all other, because it is not only most excellent for concourse and multitude, but, I say, for preservation and safety; and that not only to keep the worshippers, if they keep their order, but to keep the order and worshippers both in order and continual safety, that they may be for ever in the purest order.

40|$|In Madagascar, where 85 % of {{the working}} {{population}} earn their living through agriculture and livestock farming, farmers produce mainly rice and zebu cattle. But the country is neither able to produce enough food for its 12 million inhabitants nor able to earn enough foreign exchange to import rice and the cattle are not used widely as draught animals. In order to increase agricultural production, the zebu should be harnessed to the plough. Food self-sufficiency is a national priority, to be attained either by intensifying crop production or by increasing the area of land under cultivation. The first option, to increase yield per hectare, has attracted considerable attention and extension services have been established to promote the use of fertilizer, manure, pesticides, better quality seeds and improved techniques. But this {{has proved to be}} an expensive exercise that has failed to achieve convincing results. In fact in areas where intensified farming practices have been tried over the last few years, per capita rice production has actually decreased. However, extending the area under cultivation could lead to food self-sufficiency. At the present time, only 5 % of the island of Madagascar is cultivated. The limiting factor to increased agricultural production is neither a shortage of land nor an unsuitable climate. Madagascar's climate is such that practically any type of crop can be cultivated. Farmers are willing, intelligent and ingenious, as {{can be seen from the}} terraced paddy fields that they have developed. The major constraint to increasing the area of land under cultivation is the lack of muscle power: hands to cultivate and to weed. Unfortunately, increasing the number of working hands also increases the number of hungry mouths and only by increasing the productivity of the existing workforce will the vicious circle be broken. This means increasing production per unit of time worked, not increasing the size of workforce. Malagasy farmers work hard but their principal farming tool, the angady, limits what they can produce. The angady is a metal blade set into a wooden handle and it is used to turn over the soil and <b>break</b> down large <b>clods</b> of earth. Every farmer owns at least one and swears by it since survival depends upon it. But while the angady is an excellent gardening implement, it is not suitable for agriculture. In fact to be using this prehistoric hand ploughing tool in today's age of mechanization is agriculturally disastrous. It takes at least 60 days to cultivate one hectare using an angady, by which time not only does the most favourable time for sowing seed pass, but weeds destroyed when work began start to regrow. No matter how much farmers may wish to produce more, this laborious way of working means that they can cultivate no more than one hectare, sufficient only to feed a family and survive. Mechanization could improve this low productivity, but unfortunately people tend to think that mechanization invariably means tractors. However, tractors are only successful where there is a commitment to maintenance and where money, spare parts and skilled mechanics are available to ensure regular servicing and repair. Few people think of animal draught power as an alternative and, remarkably, of the hundreds of projects in Madagascar, none has been devoted solely to its development. Nevertheless, using animal traction for ploughing produces good results since it takes only six days to plough one hectare instead of 60 using the angady. A farmer can therefore cultivate four or five hectares during the best sowing season and prepare land on the hillsides as well as paddies along the valley floor. Implements and harness equipment can, for the most part, be maintained and repaired by the owner himself, by the local blacksmith or at the local market. Although zebus are plentiful in Madagascar (there are almost as many zebus as there are people), developing animal traction is not easy. It is the dream of every farmer to own a zebu and, when his dream comes true, he becomes the animal's slave as he strives to feed and care for it. The zebu also becomes a form of savings bank because it is easy to sell if the need arises. In effect, farmers are happy just to feed their cattle and keep them to a great age. Yet one solution to the challenge of achieving food self-sufficiency in Madagascar could be to improve the productivity of farmers by making some of their zebu cattle work for their living. 'Operation Plough' schemes have been tried before in Madagascar, but they failed. Sometimes this was because ploughs were acquired by farmers who had no zebu to draw them, and sometimes because zebus were acquired by farmers who neither knew how to feed nor look after them. It was a case of 'putting the plough before the ox'. It would have been better to have begun by training the animals and targeting only those farmers who already owned zebus and knew how to look after them. In the thirties, near Lake Alaotra, in a region known as the 'rice bowl' of Madagascar, a training centre was established to which farmers could bring their zebus. The incentive was the opportunity to buy a plough at a very favourable price. And now no-one in the region works his paddy field with an angady. Draught cultivation is widespread and it is the only region of Madagascar where a commercial surplus of rice is produced. This proves the viability of animal draught power in Madagascar. In the future, animal traction should not remain merely a secondary project component. It should be the principal component in all rural development projects where the major constraint is the human muscle power involved. In Madagascar, where 85 % {{of the working}} population earn their living through agriculture and livestock farming, farmers produce mainly rice and zebu cattle. But the country is neither able to produce enough food for its 12 million inhabitants nor [...] ...|$|R
