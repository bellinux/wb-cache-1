50|$|The Aberdeen {{chronograph}} was {{the first}} portable instrument for measuring ordnance muzzle velocity and striking power. It was invented in 1918 by Alfred Lee Loomis at the U.S. Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground. The method prevalent {{at the time was}} the Boulenge chronograph, which relied on the projectile breaking two wire screens and measuring the time between circuit-breaking. Loomis' invention improved on the Boulenge chronograph in simplicity, accuracy, reliability, ease of operation, and ease of mass production. Loomis' chronograph... consisted of an aluminum disk spooled with ticker tape, which a small motor kept revolving at a constant speed. Instead of <b>breaking</b> <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> on contact, the shell created an electrical impulse when it hit each screen, causing a spark to burn a small hole in the tape. Shell velocity could easily be calculated by measuring the distance between the spark holes.|$|R

40|$|<b>A</b> <b>circuit</b> breaker may be {{considered}} an ‘active link’, used to make and <b>break</b> <b>an</b> electrical <b>circuit</b> under conditions of varying severity.

This makes the circuit breaker one of the most safety critical, yet most unpredictable plant items on the power network. In addition, circuit breaker mal-operations account for a significant proportion of Customer Minutes Lost (CMLs), Customer Interruptions (CIs), plant replacement costs and safety issues. Conflicting regulatory and economic pressures to improve the performance, reliability and longevity of these, and other major plant items while reducing maintenance costs have forced many utilities to reassess their asset management and maintenance strategies [1]. This has led to significant investment in novel condition monitoring technologies, which in turn precipitate the need for new methods of analysing and interpreting new forms and increasing volumes of plant data...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the first}} {{applications}} of Waveform Relaxation (WR) algorithms to the transient analysis of MOS digital circuits, several {{modifications to the}} basic method {{have been used to}} improve WR efficiency and insure convergence.

40|$|Intrinsic safety {{testing is}} a method for {{ensuring}} that electrical apparatus designed {{to be used in}} explosive environments will not provide enough energy to cause an explosion. Under the current international standard an apparatus that is being tested for intrinsic safety is connected to a test device called "Spark Test Apparatus" (STA). The STA makes and <b>breaks</b> <b>a</b> short <b>circuit</b> fault condition inside an explosive gaseous chamber, and the device under test produces the energy for the electrical discharges inside the explosive environment. If an explosion does not occur during the test then the apparatus is considered to be safo for use in explosive environments.

A novel concept called the Electrical Spark Tester (EST) is being developed by CRC Mining in collaboration with German metrology institute Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt, as an alternative spark test apparatus. The proposed method utilizes a semiconductor device to emulate the electrical characteristics of a spark phenomenon.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{experimental results}} {{on the influence of}} contact opening velocity and the moment of contact opening with respect {{to the start of the}} AC current cycle on arc energy and contact erosion when <b>breaking</b> <b>an</b> AC resistive <b>circuit.</b> The test currents are 5. 6 A, 14. 7 A, and 26. 3 A, and the contact material is Ag/CdO (90 / 10). A computer controlled test system allows the control of the contact velocity profiles with constant velocities up to 0. 8 m/s and also enables the synchronization of the contact opening with a point on the AC current waveform. Contact erosion is evaluated by measuring the mass changes of the cathode and anode. The results show that increasing the contact velocity from 0. 1 m/s to 0. 8 m/s leads to an increase in the arc energy. The material transfer from one electrode to another is shown to depend on the current, the polarity of the moving contact, the moment of the contact opening with respect to the start of the AC current cycle, and the opening velocity of the contact...|$|R

40|$|Abstract-The {{protection}} of electrical circuits against the overload or short circuits is usually {{achieved by the}} single use of blow-out fuses. The paper contains the examining results of the multiple use of polymer fuses. The static and dynamic characteristics of selected fuses are acquired on the test station. Some interesting features of the polymer fuses, not included in datasheets, are carried out. The courses of characteristics in comparison to their technical data with elements of accuracy analysis are discussed. I. The polymer fuses attributes Fuses are the basic protection devices used in circuits. Except fuses there are also used bimetallic devices. The first ones break the circuit {{in the event of}} short circuit. The second ones provides overload protection. Both devices prevent damage to the connected equipment and cables. The disadvantageous feature of the traditional fuses is their blow-out. In consequence of that there is <b>a</b> <b>break</b> in <b>a</b> <b>circuit</b> and necessity of replacement. The typical bimetallic devices {{does not need to be}} replaced. They can back to their idle state. However they can reset even if the fault is not removed.

It is polymer fuse (PPTC- Polymeric Positive Temperature Coefficient), called resettable fuse [1 - 14]. It realizes functions like devices above, however it does not need to be replaced and it does not expose the equipment on damage.

40|$|Microfluidic {{systems are}} {{becoming}} increasingly complicated {{as the number of}} applications grows. The use of microfluidic systems for chemical and biological agent detection, for example, requires that a given sample be subjected to many process steps, which requires microvalves to control the position and transport of the sample. Each microfluidic application has its own specific valve requirements and this has precipitated the wide variety of valve designs reported in the literature. Each of these valve designs has its strengths and weaknesses. The strength of the valve design proposed here is its simplicity, which makes it easy to fabricate, easy to actuate, and easy to integrate with a microfluidic system. It can be applied to either gas phase or liquid phase systems. This novel design uses a secondary fluid to stop the flow of the primary fluid in the system. The secondary fluid must be chosen based on the type of flow that it must stop. A dielectric fluid must be used for a liquid phase flow driven by electroosmosis, and a liquid with a large surface tension should be used to stop a gas phase flow driven by a weak pressure differential. Experiments were carried out investigating certain critical functions of the design. These experiments verified that the secondary fluid can be reversibly moved between its 'valve opened' and 'valve closed' positions, where the secondary fluid remained as one contiguous piece during this transport process. The experiments also verified that when Fluorinert is used as the secondary fluid, the valve can <b>break</b> <b>an</b> electric <b>circuit.</b> It was found necessary to apply a hydrophobic coating to the microchannels to stop the primary fluid, an aqueous electrolyte, from wicking past the Fluorinert and short-circuiting the valve. A simple model was used to develop valve designs that could be closed using an electrokinetic pump, and re-opened by simply turning the pump off and allowing capillary forces to push the secondary fluid back into its stowed position...|$|R
