40|$|Abstract — Over {{the last}} few decades, complex {{networks}} have been intensively studied throughout many fields of science, especially in <b>biological</b> and <b>engineering</b> sciences. This paper briefly reviews the main advances in the complex <b>biological</b> and <b>engineering</b> networks, aiming {{to bridge the gap}} between the complex <b>biological</b> and <b>engineering</b> networks. Biologists pay more attention to the mechanisms and local dynamics of individuals, however, engineers are more interesting in the global dynamical behaviors. It is the time for the biologists and engineers to work together for better understanding the complex networks. I...|$|R

25|$|As {{almost any}} cereal {{containing}} certain sugars can undergo spontaneous fermentation due to wild yeasts in the air, {{it is possible}} that beer-like beverages were independently developed throughout the world soon after a tribe or culture had domesticated cereal.

Also, archaeological findings show that Chinese villagers were brewing fermented alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scale, with the production process and methods similar to that of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia.|$|E
