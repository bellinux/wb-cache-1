40|$|A two-factor {{model of}} {{positive}} and negative <b>beliefs</b> underlying attitudes toward privatization was tested among Ecuadorian employees. In Study 1, semistructured interviews uncovered 23 negative and positive <b>beliefs</b> associ-ated with privatization.

A factor analysis of the <b>beliefs</b> supported a two-factor solu-tion that separately gauged positive and negative <b>beliefs</b> toward privatization. Positive <b>beliefs</b> concerning the economic and organizational benefits of pri-vatization explained attitudes above and beyond negative <b>beliefs</b> concerning its social and national costs. The interaction between these <b>beliefs,</b> however, indicated that extremely negative <b>beliefs</b> can override positive <b>beliefs.</b> The attitudes of public sector employees were more strongly associated with neg-ative <b>beliefs</b> and less associated with positive <b>beliefs.</b> Results underscored the importance of assessing <b>beliefs</b> associated with privatization when imple-menting privatization programs and highlighted the distinct role played by positive and negative <b>beliefs...</b>|$|R
40|$|People often reason egocentrically about others' <b>beliefs,</b> {{using their}} own <b>beliefs</b> as an {{inductive}} guide. Correlational, experimental, and neuroimaging evidence suggests that people {{may be even more}} egocentric when reasoning about a religious agent's <b>beliefs</b> (e. g., God).

Today, many people still resort to shamanist rituals known as kut in Korean to settle their problems. as family <b>beliefs</b> or village <b>beliefs</b> have {{gradually}} been weakening, but Korean popular <b>beliefs</b> still have their place, in shamanism, in divination, and in geomancy, adapting to changes of the times. In other words, even now popular <b>beliefs</b> are still part of the meaningful world of the Koreans, influencing their judgment and behavior when they are in trouble. From this viewpoint, this book intends to demonstrate the general aspects of Korean popular <b>beliefs</b> and also shed light on their historical changes and present conditions. Korean popular <b>beliefs</b> do not remain separated from Korean lives or other religions such as Buddhism, Confucianism, and Christianity, but related to them. Considering such aspects of Korean popular <b>beliefs,</b> this book focuses on the correlation between Korean popular <b>beliefs</b> and other religions, between Korean popular <b>beliefs</b> and the lives of the Koreans, and between types of Korean popular <b>beliefs</b> rather than each type of Korean popular <b>beliefs</b> in isolation.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. This {{research}} was conducted to determine what the nature of teachers’ educational <b>beliefs</b> about teaching, knowledge and learning are, {{whether there is a}} relation between their educational <b>beliefs</b> {{and the way in which}} they instruct, and if a relation exists, what the nature of such a relation is. Teachers’ educational <b>beliefs</b> about the way in which learners learn and what they are supposed to learn, have a major influence on how the teacher instructs and on how the learners achieve. Educational <b>beliefs</b> are a comprehensive phenomenon and include <b>beliefs</b> about everything. Educational <b>beliefs</b> generally refer to <b>beliefs</b> about teaching, knowledge and learning. The construct epistemological <b>beliefs</b> are actually also used in the literature and can be seen as the more restricted construct that only includes <b>beliefs</b> about knowledge and learning. Both constructs are used in this study. The phenomenon of educational <b>beliefs</b> is used concerning the <b>beliefs</b> about teaching, knowledge and learning, whilst the phenomenon of epistemological <b>beliefs</b> are used when concerned with the <b>beliefs</b> about knowledge and learning. Educational <b>beliefs</b> vary from naïve to sophisticated. Teachers are characterised according to their educational <b>beliefs</b> about teaching as more teacher–centered or more learner–centered. Teachers who are more teacher–centered have more naïve epistemological <b>beliefs</b> and promote superficial learning, which leads to lower academic performances. Conversely, teachers who are more learner–centered have more sophisticated epistemological <b>beliefs</b> that promote an in depth approach to learning, which leads to higher academic performances. The implementation of Outcomes Based Education (OBE) requires inter alia a learner–centered teaching approach and more sophisticated epistemological <b>beliefs.</b> These requirements of OBE poses a major challenge to teachers with more naive epistemological <b>beliefs,</b> because <b>beliefs</b> develop over years and are deeply rooted and difficult to change. With this study it was found that the participants’ epistemological <b>beliefs</b> could be typified as a system including more and less sophisticated epistemological <b>beliefs,</b> thus they did not only have naïve or sophisticated epistemological <b>beliefs.</b> It was also found that the participants of this study were more learner–centered than teacher–centered. Participants with more naïve epistemological <b>beliefs</b> were more teacher–centered compared to participants who had less naïve, thus more sophisticated epistemological <b>beliefs</b> that were more learner–centered. A relation was found between teachers with more naïve epistemological <b>beliefs</b> and a teacher–centered approach and teachers with less naïve epistemological <b>beliefs</b> (thus more sophisticated epistemological <b>beliefs)</b> and a learner–centered approach.

5|$|Some {{practitioners}} do not emphasize <b>belief</b> in an afterlife, instead {{stressing the}} importance of behaviour and reputation in this world. In Icelandic Heathenry, there is no singular dogmatic <b>belief</b> about the afterlife. A common Heathen <b>belief</b> is that a human being has multiple souls, which are separate yet linked together. It is common to find a <b>belief</b> in four or five souls, two of which survive bodily death: one of these, the hugr, travels {{to the realm of}} the ancestors, while the other, the fetch, undergoes a process of reincarnation into a new body. In Heathen <b>belief,</b> there are various realms that the hugr can enter, based in part on the worth of the individual's earthly life; these include the hall of Valhalla, ruled over by Odin, or Sessrúmnir, the hall of Freyja. Beliefs regarding reincarnation vary widely among Heathens, although one common <b>belief</b> is that individuals are reborn within their family or clan.|$|E

40|$|This project {{emerged from}} {{previous}} research on <b>beliefs,</b> influences on behaviors, and <b>beliefs</b> interaction with reform. Previous research stated connections existed between teacher <b>beliefs</b> and teacher behaviors but criticized the use of broad, general constructs and traditional methodologies. This study challenged the portrayal of <b>beliefs</b> as isolated and static and attempted to understand connections between <b>beliefs</b> and behaviors. Utilizing qualitative methodologies, this study investigated the following research questions. 1. What insight can be gained {{on the nature of}} <b>beliefs</b> through analysis of consistent and inconsistent behaviors? 2. How do teacher’s <b>beliefs</b> interact with behaviors? This research adopted a methodology that connected interviews and instructional episodes as the informative data.

A more accurate collection of <b>beliefs</b> provided an understanding on how these <b>beliefs</b> actualized in practice.

Implicit <b>beliefs</b> {{are defined as}} the unconscious cognitive constructs that influence motivation, behavior, and affect (Bruning, Dempsey, Kauffman, 2 ̆ 6 Zumbrunn, 2011). Studies regarding implicit <b>beliefs</b> are applied to many constructs, ranging in specificity from domain-general <b>beliefs</b> such as epistemological <b>beliefs</b> (Schommer, 1990) to domain-specific <b>beliefs</b> such as reading (Schraw 2 ̆ 6 Bruning, 1999). In the present study, implicit <b>beliefs</b> about a specific writing task are compared to implicit <b>beliefs</b> about intelligence, demographic information, and participants’ educational background experiences. Research is reviewed pertaining {{to a variety of}} studies of implicit <b>beliefs.</b> One hundred fifty three students enrolled in an educational psychology course at a large Midwestern university completed {{a modified version of the}} Writing Habits and <b>Beliefs</b> Scale (Bruning, et al., 2011) twice during the semester.
