30|$|Researchers {{have found}} that {{long-term}} active syndepositional faults are the predominant controlling factor in formation of various structural slope <b>break</b> <b>belts</b> in continental rift basins (Lin et al. 2000; Wang et al. 2004; Ren et al. 2004; Feng 2006). A structural slope <b>break</b> <b>belt</b> is a pivotal zone of sudden geomorphology gradient changes, constituting demarcations of paleostructural units (Wang et al. 2003). These belts directly constrain changes in accommodation space and have important impacts on the internal makeup of sequences, the development of depositional systems, {{and the distribution of}} sand bodies (Hou et al. 2012). On the basis of sequence stratigraphic framework and syndepositional fault patterns, two types of structural slope <b>break</b> <b>belts</b> are recognized in the southeastern basin margin: the Liudong steep slope fault belt and the Yaxi fault terrace belt. These belts provide diverse controls on the configuration of stratigraphic sequences and the stacking patterns of depositional system tracts in combination with regular lake level fluctuations.|$|R

40|$|The budget {{equation}} of the zonally averaged angular momentum is analyzed by introducing belts of 1000 -km width {{to cover the}} meridional plane from pole to pole up to an altitude of 28 km. Using ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA) data the fluxes of angular momentum are evaluated {{as well as the}} mountain and friction torques per belt. Generalized streamfunctions and velocity potentials are introduced to better depict the fluxes related to the angular momentum transferred at the ground during an event of mountain or friction torque. The variance of the total flux divergence per belt is one order of magnitude larger than those of the torques. All variances peak at midlatitudes. As a rule, the structure of the generalized streamfunctions changes little during an event; that is, the structure of the nondivergent part of the fluxes is stable. That of the divergent part, as represented by the velocity potential, undergoes a rapid change near the peak of a torque event. Positive friction torque events in midlatitude belts are preceded by a divergence of angular momentum fluxes in that belt, which is linked to the anticyclonic mass circulation needed to induce the positive torque. The divergence in the <b>belt</b> <b>breaks</b> down shortly before the torque is strongest. Angular momentum is transported upward from the ground after that. Much of the angular momentum generated in a midlatitude belt by positive mountain torques is transported out of the domain, {{but there is also a}} short burst of upward transports. Angular momentum anomalies linked to torque events near the equator tend to be symmetric with respect to the equator. Related fluxes affect the midlatitudes of both hemispheres. 1...|$|E

40|$|AbstractBased on {{comprehensive}} {{analyses of}} seismic and log data, this {{study indicates that}} mainly four widespread angular to minor angular unconformities (Tg 8, Tg 51, Tg 5 and Tg 3) were formed during the Paleozoic. Through the interpretation of structural unconformities, calculation of eroded thickness, correction of palaeo-water depth and compaction and compilation of the Early Paleozoic structural maps, the Early Paleozoic slope <b>break</b> <b>belt</b> (geomorphologic unit) of the Tarim Basin is subdivided into uplift area, subaqueous uplift area, rift slope <b>break</b> <b>belt,</b> flexure slope <b>break</b> <b>belt</b> (slope belt), depression area and deep basin area. Palaeogeomorphology of the Cambrian-Early Ordovician was approximately in EW trend within which three tectonic units including the Tabei Palaeo-uplift, the northern Depressional Belt and the southern Palaeo-uplift developed respectively and are grouped into two slope break systems namely as the Tabei Palaeo-uplift and the southern Palaeo-uplift. These tectonic units obviously control the deposition of isolated platform, open platform, restricted platform and deep basin. Influenced by extrusion in the Mid-Late Ordovician, the southern and northern subaqueous uplifts gradually elevated and then were eroded. Resultantly two slope break systems developed, namely as the northern and central Palaeo-uplifts which obviously controlled the deposition of provenance area, isolated platform, mixed continental shelf, slope and basin facies. The intensive extrusion of the Mid-Late Ordovician leads to significant tectonic deformation of the Tarim Basin: large area of uplifting and erosion and development of EW trending anticline and syncline. Deposition of shore, tidal flat, delta, shallow marine clastics and deep marine facies is obviously controlled by the Tabei, the southern and the Tadong Palaeo-uplifts. Slope break systems control development of stratigraphic unconformity and thus truncation and onlap unconformity zones become favorable areas in a palaeo-uplift and at a palaeo-slope belt for forming important unconformity traps; Whereas slope (slope <b>break)</b> <b>belt</b> along a palaeo-uplift margin is a geomorphologic unit where high-energy sedimentary facies widely develops, such as reef, oolitic sandy clastics or bioclastic limestone beach bar facies, thus litho-structural composite hydrocarbon accumulations usually develop when tectonic condition is suitable. In addition, large-scale palaeo-uplifts are the most favourable areas for hydrocarbon accumulation developmen...|$|R

30|$|During the lowstand system tract (LST), {{the lake}} level {{declined}} and the lake shrank.

Erosion surface and incised valley developed on the gentle slope belt and slope fan and a lowstand wedge developed concurrently on the bend slope <b>break</b> <b>belt,</b> together making up the LST combination facies. During the lacustrine expanding system tract (EST), the lake level rose quickly and the accommodation space of the lake expanded. The sediment supply was temporarily insufficient. Therefore, the fan delta in the steep slope fault belt retrograded and diminished in size, and a mass of deep lacustrine mudstone was deposited in the open lake basin and the bend slope <b>break</b> <b>belt.</b> During the highstand system tract (HST), the lake level reached a maximum and began to fall.

Sequence stratigraphic {{framework of the}} Paleogene system in the Fushan sag, northern South China Sea, was built using 3 D and 2 D seismic data, complemented by drilling cores and well logs data. One first-order, three second-order and seven third-order sequences were identified. Analysis of paleotectonic stress field, unconformities and subsidence history showed that the Paleogene tectonic evolution presented significant characteristics of multistage and episode, and {{can be divided into}} three stages: rifting stage I (initial rifting period), rifting stage II (rapid subsidence period), rifting stage III (fault-depressed diversionary period).

50|$|The {{advantage}} of a spiral conveyor {{is that it can}} be used with a minimum amount of control software. The disadvantages are that a relatively large area (floor space) is required compared with other product lifts and vertical transport takes {{a great deal of time}} on account of the number of cycles which the transport belt completes. Certain products can also become misshapen since they are transported at an angle. One only has to think of plastic bottles which are wrapped in clingfilm which can become permanently misshapen if the clingfilm has still not completely cooled. A product is only supported at two angles on a spiral conveyor, because of the lifting angle and the radius within which the transport conveyor is placed. If a product has to be supported so that it is flat during transport, this will not be possible with a spiral conveyor. The drive motor of a spiral conveyor must always be controlled with a frequency regulator in order to prevent excessive slippage of the transport belt. It is also necessary to take account that products must not touch at intake. If products are touching each other at intake, the products can become jammed, which can result in the transport <b>belt</b> <b>breaking</b> down. It is, therefore, recommended that a good feed mechanism be provided for a spiral conveyor. In the case of most spiral conveyors, products must also be presented centrally, as the eccentric loading of spiral conveyors can cause excessive slippage. If a product becomes stuck for any reason, there is a good to a very good chance that the lamellae of the transport belt will disintegrate, which can cause a considerable loss in production along the whole of the production line, something which is associated with huge additional costs for replacements.|$|R
