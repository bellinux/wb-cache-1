In order {{to find a way}} to create a construct able to replace and regenerate this particular tissue, a functionalized biodegradable polymer via polymer brushes can represent a design for cartilage loss.

40|$|A novel {{method of}} thermo {{controlled}} emulsion polymerization has been employed to synthesize spherical polyelectrolyte brushes that {{consist of a}} solid polystyrene core and a poly acrylic acid PAA shell covalently attached on the core surface densely by one end. The growth of brushes from the core surface was monitored by dynamic light scattering DLS. The particle size of PS core latex showed a narrow size distribution when observed by scanning electron microscopy SEM. The brush size changed significantly upon changing pH value and ionic strength, and displayed similar behavior to brushes prepared by photo emulsion polymerization. The grafting density of the PAA brush, which was determined by cutting off the PAA chains using alkali hydrolysis, confirmed the formation of PAA <b>brushe...</b>|$|E

At first, oleic acid modified magnetite nanoparticles MNP were synthesized by the coprecipitation method and then embedded into the polystyrene core by miniemulsion polymerization to obtain magnetic polystyrene latices MPL. Finally, magnetic spherical poly acrylic acid PAA brushes were synthesized by photoemulsion polymerization. Effects of MNP and acrylic acid AA content on the brush structure were studied in detail.

40|$|Motivated by the unceasing {{interest}} in hidden Markov models (HMMs), this paper re-examines hidden path inference in these models, using primarily a risk-based framework. While {{the most common}} maximum a posteriori (MAP), or Viterbi, path estimator and the minimum error, or Posterior Decoder (PD), have long been around, other path estimators, or decoders, have been either only hinted at or applied more recently and in dedicated applications generally unfamiliar to the statistical learning community. Over a decade ago, however, a family of algorithmically defined decoders aiming to hybridize the two standard ones was proposed (<b>Brushe</b> et al., 1998). The present paper gives a careful analysis of this hybridization approach, identifies several problems and issues with it and other previously proposed approaches, and proposes practical resolutions of those. Furthermore, simple modifications of the classical criteria for hidden path recognition are shown {{to lead to a}} new class of decoders. Dynamic programming algorithms to compute these decoders in the usual forward-backward manner are presented. A particularly interesting subclass of such estimators can be also viewed as hybrids of the MAP and PD estimators. Similar to previously proposed MAP-PD hybrids, the new class is parameterized by a small number of tunable parameters. Unlike their algorithmic predecessors, the new risk-based decoders are more clearly interpretable, and, most importantly, work "out of the box" in practice, which is demonstrated on some real bioinformatics tasks and data. Some further generalizations and applications are discussed in conclusion.

40|$|This thesis {{involves}} {{descriptions of}} solid surface modifications with various polymeric materials which {{were used as}} a guiding agent for motion of chemical and biological species. Quasi-two dimensional poly(oligoethylene glycol) acrylate polymer brush based molecular conduits have been designed {{with the goal of}} regulating and controlling the diffusive transport of molecular, e. g. organic dyes, and ionic species, e. g. AuCl 4 -, and Cu 2 + ions, along predefined 2 -D pathways. The transport of these chemical species has been examined by both fluorescence and dark field microscopy. The polymer brushes were formed through microcontact printing of an initiator, followed by surface-initiated Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (SI-ATRP). SI-ATRP enables both 2 -D patterning with a resolution of about 1 micrometer, and control over the resultant polymer brush thickness (which was varied from 10 - 100 nm). A hydrophilic poly(oligoethylene glycol) acrylate <b>brushe</b> was selected because of its potential to dissolve a wide range of hydrophilic species. The transport of fluorescent species can be directly followed. A non-lithographic fabrication method was developed for microfluidic devices used in the diffusion studies. Singular channel microfluidic device was utilized to study the directed organic dye diffusion. The AuCl 4 -, and Cu 2 + ion transport was studied by designing molecular devices with two microfluidic channels. We have demonstrated that the various species of interest diffuse much more rapidly along the predefined pathway than along the bare (polymer brush free) regions of the substrate, demonstrating that diffusive conduits for molecular transport can indeed be formed. The protein resistance of poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) brushes grafted from silicon wafers was investigated {{as a function of the}} chain molecular weight, grafting density, and temperature. Above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of 32 °C, the collapse of the water swollen chains, determined by ellipsometry, depends on the grafting density and molecular weight. Ellipsometry, radio assay, and fluorescence imaging demonstrated that, below the LCST, the brushes repel protein as effectively as oligoethylene oxide terminated monolayers. Above 32 °C, very low levels of protein adsorb on densely grafted brushes, and the amounts of adsorbed protein increase with decreasing brush grafting densities. Brushes that do not exhibit a collapse transition also bind protein, even though the chains remain extended above the LCST. These findings suggest possible mechanisms underlying protein interactions with end-grafted PNIPAM brushes. 3 D porous materials on solid surfaces were built to mimic the corneal basement membrane so that we can monitor direction of the corneal epithelia cells behaviors as the surface topography changes. We have used colloidal crystal templating approach to build the 3 D porous structures. Polystyrene (PS) colloids were crystallized in a flow cell. The crystals were filled with acrylamide precursor (including photoinitiator, crosslinker) in the oxygen free aqueous solution. After polymerization of acrylamide under UV exposure, PS colloids were dissolved in chloroform. Thus, 3 D porous polyacrylamide hydrogels have been fabricated. The various pore sizes at the 3 D porous surface have been obtained by using PS colloids with the colloid diameters ranging from 450 nm to 4000 nm. Human corneal epithelial cell growth, morphology change and adhesion studies have been conducted on the porous polyacrylamide scaffolds. The effect of pore size on human corneal epithelial cell function has been investigated...|$|E
