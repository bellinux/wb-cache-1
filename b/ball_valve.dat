2500|$|The first {{artificial}} heart valve was the caged-ball, which utilizes a metal cage to house a silicone elastomer ball. When {{blood pressure in}} the chamber of the heart exceeds that of {{the pressure on the}} outside of the chamber the ball is pushed against the cage and allows blood to flow. At the completion of the heart's contraction, the pressure inside the chamber drops and is lower than beyond the valve, so the ball moves back against the base of the valve forming a seal. In 1952, Charles A. Hufnagel implanted caged-ball heart valves in ten patients (six survived the operation), marking the first long-term success in prosthetic heart valves. A similar valve was invented by Miles [...] "Lowell" [...] Edwards and Albert Starr in 1960 (commonly referred to as the Starr-Edwards Silastic <b>Ball</b> <b>Valve).</b> The first human implant was on Sept 21, 1960. It consisted of a silicone ball enclosed in a cage formed by wires originating from the valve housing. Caged ball valves have a high tendency to form blood clots, so the patient must have a high degree of anti-coagulation, usually with a target INR of 2.5-3.5. Edwards Lifesciences discontinued production of the Starr-Edwards valve in 2007.|$|E
2500|$|Early {{locomotives}} were {{fitted with}} a valve controlled by a weight suspended from the end of a lever, with the steam outlet being stopped by a cone-shaped valve. As there was nothing to prevent the weighted lever from bouncing when the locomotive ran over irregularities in the track, thus wasting steam, the weight was later replaced by a more stable spring-loaded column, often supplied by Salter, a well-known spring scale manufacturer. The danger of these devices was that the driving crew could be tempted to add weight to the arm to increase pressure. Most early boilers were {{fitted with a}} tamper-proof [...] "lockup" [...] direct-loaded <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> protected by a cowl. In the late 1850s, John Ramsbottom introduced a safety valve that became popular in Britain during {{the latter part of the}} 19th century. Not only was this valve tamper-proof, but tampering by the driver could only have the effect of easing pressure. George Richardson's safety valve was an American invention introduced in 1875, and was designed to release the steam only at the moment when the pressure attained the maximum permitted. This type of valve is in almost universal use at present. Britain's Great Western Railway was a notable exception to this rule, retaining the direct-loaded type until the end of its separate existence, because it was considered that such a valve lost less pressure between opening and closing.|$|E
50|$|During the {{suction stroke}} of the {{delivery}} piston the medium is sucked in via the open suction <b>ball</b> <b>valve.</b> At {{the same time}} the <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> on the delivery line is pushed into the valve seating by the underpressure resulting from the suction (automatic valves). In parallel with this, the second delivery piston is making the pressure stroke and forces the medium through the discharge <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> and into the delivery line. The suction <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> is pushed into its seating by the delivery line pressure and thereby closes off the connection to pump intake.|$|E

50|$|Many {{industries}} encounter {{problem with}} residues in the <b>ball</b> <b>valve.</b> Where the fluid is meant for human consumption, residues {{may also be}} health hazard, and when where the fluid changes {{from time to time}} contamination of one fluid with another may occur. Residues arise because in the half open position of the <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> a gap is created between the ball bore and the body in which fluid can be trapped. To avoid the fluid getting into this cavity, the cavity has to be plugged, which can be done by extending the seats in such a manner that it is always in contact with the ball. This type of <b>ball</b> <b>valve</b> is known as Cavity Filler <b>Ball</b> <b>Valve.</b>|$|E
