5|$|Demons can <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> with {{in battle}} and {{recruited}} {{if the right}} conversation is initiated. Once {{a part of the}} player's party, they will fight alongside them. In addition to standard demons, the player can ally with one human companion, with three being available on the first playthrough and a fourth unlocking during the second. When the player or their human partner dies in battle, they are granted a Guardian Spirit, who revives them at the last save point and teaches them new skills and alter the player's stats. The Guardian's specialties affect how stats are changed: a higher power ranking will raise the player's strength, but lower magic will decrease their Magic Point meter. The Guardian changes each time the player dies.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a demon, which initiates a negotiation. For those demons who can talk, the responses vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A negotiation can fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E
5|$|He {{was sent}} to Belgian Second Division side Royal Antwerp on a loan spell. He {{got off to a}} bad start at the club and asked to return to Old Trafford after being abused by Antwerp {{supporters}} outside the Bosuilstadion, and had to <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> into staying by manager Regi Van Acker. Following this start the club then won 15 matches in a row and Higginbotham become popular with the fans. However, the season ended with defeat in a play-off game, and after the final whistle there was an alleged attack on referee Amand Ancion by teammate Ronnie Wallwork. Higginbotham was subsequently banned from football for a year for his involvement. In September 1999, a Belgian court reduced Higginbotham's ban to four months. Ancion maintained that Wallwork had grabbed him by the throat and that Higginbotham had headbutted him. Higginbotham always maintained his innocence, stating that he had tried to intervene peacefully after Wallwork had confronted Ancion in an aggressive manner. Alex Ferguson believed the player's innocence and handed both players four-year contracts as the club appealed their suspensions.|$|E

5|$|Key {{elements}} in the game are negotiation with and the fusion and creation of demons. Encountered in battle, demons can <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> with and negotiated into running from the battle, giving money or items, or joining the player's party. If the negotiation fails, the demon will attack. Once a demon is won over, they are given a loyalty meter which {{is influenced by the}} player's actions. If the demon is treated well and performs actions in battle it approves of, its loyalty will increase. If the opposite occurs, the demon will begin to disobey the protagonist, then leave. Demons can be fused together at a special location in the game called the Hotel Goumaden, where fusions are supervised by the NPC Dr. Victor. Demon fusion is governed by a comparability system, with more favorable fusions emerging from better demon compatibility. Demons can also be fused with weapons to grant stat boosts, and after a certain point in the game artificial demons called Zomas can be used and strengthened through repeated fusions.|$|E

25|$|The {{arbitration}} {{began in}} the Belvedere Palace, in Vienna, at noon on November 2, 1938. The Czechoslovak and Hungarian delegations were allowed to present their arguments. Chvalkovský was brief and left the task of presenting the Czechoslovak case to Krno. Although it was explicitly demanded by Czechoslovak representatives, both arbiters refused to let Slovak Prime Minister Tiso and Subcarpathian Prime Minister Voloshyn participate. Ribbentrop and Ciano reasoned that only {{the representatives of the}} central governments could participate (namely Czechoslovakia in this case rather than the partially autonomous Slovakia or Carpatho-Ruthenia). They assumed that Chvalkovský would be more submissive and Tiso would complicate the negotiations. The negotiation was a formality and a new border was drawn after half a day. When the award was announced by Ribbentrop around 7 p.m., the Czechoslovak delegation was so shocked that Jozef Tiso actually had to <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> by Ribbentrop and Chvalkovský into signing the document.|$|E

Jackie Templeton (Demi Moore) reveals her sister Laura Templeton (Janine Turner) {{disappeared}} under similar circumstances. The two friends discover a thief named David Gray was behind the disappearances. While Laura Templeton was not harmed, Gray revealed he had killed Laura Spencer, leading Luke to kill him during a fight. Luke, though still uncertain about his wife's ultimate fate, begins an affair with scam artist Holly Sutton (Emma Samms). Their affair is cut short when Luke is presumed dead in an avalanche. Holly {{falls in love with}} Robert, despite Luke revealing he is alive. Increasingly lonely, Luke decides to run for mayor of Port Charles, and wins the election. While celebrating his victory, Laura Spencer reveals she is alive and had been kidnapped by the Cassadine family. Mikkos' cousin (later reconned as eldest son) Stavros Cassadine (then John Martinuzzi) had spared her life since he {{had fallen in love with}} her. He forced her to marry him, though the marriage was invalid because she was already married to Luke. Stavros came to town to claim his wife, but was killed after falling down a flight of stairs after a struggle with Luke. The couple attempted to settle into their roles in politics, but found the roles stifling. In 1984, Luke and Laura decide to leave Port Charles and their enemies behind and travel the world, but not before Laura reveals she is pregnant. Later that year, Laura's mother Lesley appears to die in a car accident arranged by the Cassadine family.|$|E

The coup was based upon the owners' disgruntlement with the increasing cost of the Dallara DW12 chassis, and fines given out for the use of inapproved parts in races earlier in the season.

500|$|Over {{the course}} of the Obama presidency, {{particularly}} during the second term, Michelle Obama was subject to speculation over whether she would run for the presidency herself, similarly to predecessor Hillary Clinton. A potential Michelle Obama candidacy was supported by both Samuel L. Jackson and James Clyburn. On April 6, 2009, CNN did a poll on whether she should run for the presidency in 2020, 83% of responders being opposed to the idea. A May 2015 Rasmussen poll found Obama had 22% of support to Clinton's 56% of winning the Democratic nomination, higher than that of potential candidates Elizabeth Warren, Martin O'Malley and Bernie Sanders. Another poll from that month found 71% of Americans believed that Obama should not run for the presidency, only 14% approving. On January 14, 2016, during a town-hall meeting, President Obama was asked if the First Lady could <b>be</b> <b>talked</b> into running.
