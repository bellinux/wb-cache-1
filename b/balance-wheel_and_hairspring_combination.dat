5000|$|Gravity has {{a direct}} effect on the most {{delicate}} parts of the escapement, namely the pallet fork, balance wheel <b>and</b> <b>hairspring.</b> Most notably is the hairspring, which functions as the timing regulator for the escapement and is thus the part most sensitive to any exterior effects, such as magnetism, shocks, temperature, as well as inner effects such as pinning positions (inner collet), terminal curve, and heavy points on the balance wheel.|$|R
50|$|The Manistee Watch Company made {{low quality}} watch {{mechanisms}} that {{were put into}} cases by other companies. The watches were in 16 and 18 size. The company name was emblazoned on the back plate of most 18 size movements. Some 16 size movements were jeweled. The dials, jewels, <b>and</b> <b>hairsprings</b> for the mechanisms were purchased from European watch manufacturers, but all other parts aside from the outside case were produced at the Manistee Watch factory. Most of the jewels for the watches were from heliotrope garnet and manufactured specifically to the correct dimensions for the Manistee watches in Switzerland. The first watches made sold for five dollars each.|$|R
5000|$|A torsion {{pendulum}} clock, or torsion clock (also known as 400-day or anniversary clock), is a mechanical clock which keeps {{time with a}} mechanism called a {{torsion pendulum}}. This is a weighted disk or wheel, often a decorative wheel with 3 or 4 chrome balls on ornate spokes, suspended by a thin wire or ribbon called a torsion spring (also known as [...] "suspension spring"). The torsion pendulum rotates about the vertical axis of the wire, twisting it, instead of swinging like an ordinary pendulum. The force of the twisting torsion spring reverses the direction of rotation, so the torsion pendulum oscillates slowly, clockwise and counterclockwise. The clock's gears apply a pulse of torque {{to the top of}} the torsion spring with each rotation to keep the wheel going. The wheel and torsion spring function similarly to a watch's balance wheel <b>and</b> <b>hairspring,</b> as a harmonic oscillator to control the rate of the clock's hands.|$|R
50|$|Early watches used a {{solid steel}} balance. As {{temperature}} increased, the solid balance expanded in size, changing {{the moment of}} inertia and changing {{the timing of the}} watch. In addition, the hairspring would lengthen, decreasing its spring constant. This problem was initially solved through the use of the compensation balance. The compensation balance consisted of a ring of steel sandwiched to a ring of brass. These rings were then split in two places. The balance would, at least theoretically, actually decrease in size with heating to compensate for the lengthening of the hairspring. Through careful adjustment of the placement of the balance screws (brass or gold screws placed in the rim of the balance), a watch could be adjusted to keep time the same at both hot (100 °F) and cold (32°) temperatures. Unfortunately, a watch so adjusted would run slow at temperatures between these two. The problem was completely solved through the use of special alloys for the balance <b>and</b> <b>hairspring</b> which were essentially immune to thermal expansion. Such an alloy is used in Hamilton's 992E and 992B.|$|R
50|$|In a {{watch that}} is not {{compensated}} {{for the effects of}} temperature the weaker spring takes longer to return the balance wheel back toward the center, so the ‘beat’ gets slower and the watch loses time. Ferdinand Berthoud found in 1773 that an ordinary brass balance <b>and</b> steel <b>hairspring,</b> subjected to a 60 °F (33 °C) temperature increase, loses 393 seconds (6 1/2 minutes) per day, of which 312 seconds is due to spring elasticity decrease.|$|R
25|$|Within the Oyster Perpetual 26/31/34/36/39 lineup, {{there are}} three {{different}} movements; the 39 features the Caliber 3132 movement with the Parachrom <b>hairspring</b> <b>and</b> Paraflex shock absorbers (the Oyster Perpetual 39 is a less sporty variant of the Rolex Explorer 39mm as they share the same case, same bracelet and buckle, same bezel and same movement, with a different dial and different hands), while the 34 and 36 models have the Caliber 3130 featuring the Parachrom <b>hairspring,</b> <b>and</b> the smallest 28 and 31 models have Calibre 2231. The Oyster Perpetual Date 34 (or simply Date 34) adds a date display and date movement, plus the options of a white gold fluted bezel and diamonds on the dial.|$|R
50|$|A balance wheel, or balance, is the {{timekeeping}} device used {{in mechanical}} watches and some clocks, {{analogous to the}} pendulum in a pendulum clock. It is a weighted wheel that rotates back and forth, being returned toward its center position by a spiral torsion spring, the balance spring or hairspring. It {{is driven by the}} escapement, which transforms the rotating motion of the watch gear train into impulses delivered to the balance wheel. Each swing of the wheel (called a 'tick' or 'beat') allows the gear train to advance a set amount, moving the hands forward. The balance wheel <b>and</b> <b>hairspring</b> together form a harmonic oscillator, which due to resonance oscillates preferentially at a certain rate, its resonant frequency or 'beat', and resists oscillating at other rates. The combination of the mass of the balance wheel and the elasticity of the spring keep the time between each oscillation or ‘tick’ very constant, accounting for its near universal use as the timekeeper in mechanical watches to the present. From its invention in the 14th century until tuning fork and quartz movements became available in the 1960s, virtually every portable timekeeping device used some form of balance wheel.|$|R

5000|$|The first way {{consists}} {{of making the}} moving parts of alloys chosen to be insensitive to magnetic fields. These alloys include Invar (iron-nickel-carbon-chromium alloy), Glucydur (beryllium-bronze alloy), Nivarox (iron-nickel-chromium-titanium-beryllium alloy) and Elinvar (an alloy similar to Invar, though less resistant to magnetism and more resistant to thermal influence). These alloys are preferred by different watchmakers due to their differing properties. Since the 1950s, Nivarox and Glucydur were extensively used by watchmakers. In the 1960s, almost all Swiss watches had Glucydur balance <b>and</b> Nivarox <b>hairsprings.</b> The anchors, escape wheels and other watch mechanisms were also made of non-magnetic metals or alloys.|$|R
5000|$|With price ranges {{similar to}} Swiss luxury brands, the quality, {{fit and finish}} of Raketa timepieces have {{improved}} markedly since the 1960s. Since [...] "Raketa" [...] {{is one of the}} rare manufacturers capable of fully producing its watches, including movements, <b>hairsprings</b> <b>and</b> escapements in-house, its parent firm, Petrodvorets Watch Factory, is beginning to supply some Swiss watch brands having difficulty acquiring Swiss ETA movements.|$|R
50|$|The Petrodvorets Watch Factory Raketa, {{is one of}} {{only five}} watch brands in the world {{producing}} their movements in-house from start to finish, including <b>hairsprings</b> <b>and</b> escapements. Most watch brands globally do not produce their own hairsprings, they generally order them from Nivarox, a subsidiary of Swatch Group. This enables the Russian military industry to be independent from western suppliers, especially for producing hairsprings needed in the military aviation industry.|$|R

50|$|The Rolex Oyster Perpetual Milgauss is a {{wristwatch}} model {{introduced by}} Rolex in 1956 with model number 6541. The Milgauss {{was designed as}} an antimagnetic watch specifically for those who worked in power plants, medical facilities and research labs (like CERN in Geneva) where electromagnetic fields can cause havoc with the timing of a watch. The current (post-2007) model Milgauss {{is equipped with a}} magnetic alloy (Parachrom-Blu) <b>hairspring</b> <b>and</b> movement encased by a magnetic shield, most likely composed of a high magnetic permeability material (see Mu-metal or Permalloy). The name Milgauss is derived from the Latin mille, which means one-thousand, and gauss, the unit of a magnetic field. This model is so named because it can withstand a magnetic flux density of 1,000 gauss.|$|R
50|$|Gravity {{comes into}} play on the {{remaining}} effects. One of them is easily taken away, namely heavy points on the balance wheel. This leaves pinning point and terminal curve. Both of these add a lot of variation to the regulation of a watch; assembly, regulation adjustments by the watchmaker, positioning in the watch, and later position changes by the owner. As the balance wheel goes from one extreme position to the other in its swing back <b>and</b> forth, the <b>hairspring's</b> coils extend <b>and</b> contract a great deal, leading to problems that are extremely hard to counteract. Some have tried using hairsprings that are cylindrical or even spherical instead of flat as is prominent today. Some variations of Breguet's overcoil {{have been developed to}} counteract the effects of the terminal curve. As for the pinning point, Grossmann, Berthoud, Breguet, Caspari and Leroy tried many different possibilities, but not much improvement was gained.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Minot {{liked to}} have him with her sons, because they also were to paddle their own canoes by and by, and she {{believed}} that, rich or poor, boys make better men for learning to use the talents they possess, not merely as ornaments, but tools with which to carve their own fortunes; and the best help toward this end {{is an example of}} faithful work, high aims, and honest living. So Ralph came often, and in times of trouble was a real rainy-day friend. Jack grew very fond of him during his imprisonment, for the good youth ran in every evening to get commissions, amuse the boy with droll accounts of the day's adventures, or invent lifts, bed-tables, and foot-rests for the impatient invalid. Frank found him a sure guide through the mechanical mysteries which he loved, and spent many a useful half-hour discussing cylinders, pistons, valves, <b>and</b> <b>balance-wheels.</b> Jill also came in for her share of care and comfort; the poor little back lay all the easier for the air-cushion Ralph got her, and the weary headaches found relief from the spray atomizer, which softly distilled its scented dew on the hot forehead till she fell asleep.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston University This {{item was}} {{digitized}} by the Internet Archive. The {{system of the}} <b>hairspring</b> <b>and</b> balance wheel used to regulate watches and chronometers does not perform an exact simple harmonic motion. For the proper function of the watch the deviation from isochronism of the vibrations, caused by the reaction force at the fixed end point for any distortion of the spring, must be as small as possible. This reaction force {{is found to be}} correspondingly small if the shape of the hairspring is designed so that the reaction force at the end point is small. In theory only, perfect isochronism can be accomplished by a flat spring having one end free so that for any distortion of the sprang, the tangent to the end point moves parallel to itself; however, the free end spring cannot be realised in a watch. Phillips' solution to the problem primarily expresses that the reaction force at the end point is proportional to the displacement of the end point that would occur for a free spring. His solution is based on the problem of finding a possible curve such that the terminal point has a given trajectory or displacement, and simultaneously, at any point of the trajectory the tangent has an imposed direction.
