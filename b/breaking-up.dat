5|$|In July, 1983, Mercyful Fate {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album at Easy Sound Recording, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Entitled Melissa, {{the album was}} produced by Henrik Lund and released on October 30, 1983 on Roadrunner Records. After a number of concerts around Denmark, Mercyful Fate entered the studio in May 1984 to record their second studio album Don't Break the Oath, which was released on September 7, 1984. During the album's supporting tour, the band played the US for two months and made festival appearances in Germany. Despite winning a cult following around the world, Mercyful Fate broke up in April, 1985, due to musical differences. Guitarist Hank Shermann wanted the band {{to move to a}} more commercial sound; King Diamond refused and announced his departure from Mercyful Fate, which led to the band <b>breaking-up.</b>|$|E
25|$|Dampier was {{decommissioned}} at Chatham on 31 January 1968 {{and reduced}} to the Reserve. The ship was later placed on the Disposal List, and then sold to a Belgian shipbreaker. She was towed away for <b>breaking-up</b> on 17 January 1969.|$|E
25|$|During the {{suppression}} of the monasteries All Saints' medieval stained glass was destroyed, as was, in 1561, a rood screen with its attached gilded crucifix and figures of Mary and St John, and the Easter Sepulchre.

60|$|The jovial party {{broke up}} next morning. <b>Breakings-up</b> are capital things in our school-days, but in after life they are painful enough. Death, self-interest, and fortune's changes, are every day {{breaking}} up many a happy group, and scattering them far and wide; {{and the boys}} and girls never come back again. We do not mean {{to say that it was}} exactly the case in this particular instance; all we wish to inform the reader is, that the different members of the party dispersed to their several homes; that Mr. Pickwick and his friends once more took their seats on the top of the Muggleton coach; and that Arabella Allen repaired to her place of destination, wherever it might have been--we dare say Mr. Winkle knew, but we confess we don't--under the care and guardianship of her brother Benjamin, and his most intimate and particular friend, Mr. Bob Sawyer.|$|R
6000|$|One of {{the lively}} episodes of {{hospital}} life, is the frequent marching away of such as are {{well enough to}} rejoin their regiments, or betake themselves to some convalescent camp. The ward master comes {{to the door of}} each room that is to be thinned, reads off a list of names, bids their owners look sharp and be ready when called for; and, as he vanishes, the rooms fall into an indescribable state of topsy-turvyness, as the boys begin to black their boots, brighten spurs, if they have them, overhaul knapsacks, make presents; are fitted out with needfuls, and--well, why not?--kissed sometimes, as they say, good-bye; for in all human probability we shall never meet again, and a woman's heart yearns over anything that has clung to her for help and comfort. I never liked these <b>breakings-up</b> of my little household: though my short stay showed me but three. I was immensely gratified by the hand shakes I got, for their somewhat painful cordiality assured me that I had not tried in vain. The big Prussian rumbled out his unintelligible adieux, with a grateful face and a premonitory smooth of his yellow mustache, but got no farther, for some one else stepped up, with a large brown hand extended, and this recommendation of our very faulty establishment: ...|$|R
25|$|The {{ship was}} {{decommissioned}} in March 1947 after a service of training cadets since 1940. For {{a short while}} between 1949 and 1951, it was a museum ship anchored {{at the port of}} the Kabataş quarter in Istanbul, on the European shoreline of the Bosphorus. Hamidiye was then laid up at the Golden Horn between 1951 and 1964, until it was sold for scrap on 10 September 1964. It was then towed to the Paşabahçe quarter in the Beykoz district of Istanbul, on the Anatolian shoreline of the Bosphorus, and its <b>breaking-up</b> was completed there in 1966.|$|E
25|$|St. Petersburg {{was built}} by Peter the Great at the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth century, on the swampy shores and islands of the Neva. The difficulties of construction were numerous, but Peter was unperturbed by the expenditure of human life required to fulfill his vision of a city on the coast. Of the artisans whom he compelled to come north to lay the foundations of the city, thousands died of hardship and disease; and the city, in its unnatural location, was at the mercy of terrible floods caused by the <b>breaking-up</b> of the ice of the Lake Ladoga just east of it or- as on the occasion described in the poem- by the west wind blowing back the Neva. There had been one such devastating flood in 1777 and again in 1824, during Pushkin’s time and the flood modeled in the poem, and they continue to this day.|$|E
500|$|Glatton was {{immediately}} assigned as tender to HMS Excellent upon completion and remained in Portsmouth {{for the bulk}} of her career. She participated in a gunnery trial in 1872 where HMS Hotspur fired on her turret at a range of [...] Neither of the [...] shells that hit her turret penetrated although some rivets were dislodged. She was mobilised in 1878 for service with the Particular Service Squadron. In 1881 she received [...] torpedo launchers as well as three small quick-firing guns for use against torpedo boats later in the decade. Glatton participated in the 1887 fleet manoeuvres, but she returned to reserve afterwards. She was sold in 1903 for <b>breaking-up.</b>|$|E
500|$|The downtempo {{song was}} {{developed}} {{on the following}} day, with Madonna writing the lyrics and Leonard composing the melody. Named [...] "The Look of Love", the song contains the line [...] "No where to run, no place to hide. From the look of love, from the eyes of pride". Madonna {{was inspired by the}} look that actor James Stewart gave actress Grace Kelly in the 1954 film Rear Window. Madonna said: [...] "I can't describe it, but that is the way I want someone to look at me when he loves me. It's the most pure look of love and adoration. Like surrender. It's devastating." [...] After [...] "The Look of Love", Madonna went on to develop two further songs with Bray as the producer. The first was called [...] "Causing a Commotion", and was inspired by Penn and the couple's often tumultuous relationship. Madonna felt that her marriage to Penn {{was on the verge of}} <b>breaking-up,</b> due to Penn's abusive and violent nature. In a Rolling Stone article dated September 10, 1987, Madonna spoke about Penn's impact on her life and the song: [...] "I don't like violence. I never condone hitting anyone, and I never thought that any violence should have taken place. But on the other hand, I understood Sean's anger and believe me, I have wanted to hit him many times. I never would you know, because I realize that it would just make things worse. [...] I felt like he was 'Causing a Commotion' to purposefully distract me. I wrote this song and vented my frustration in it." [...] The last song developed was [...] "Can't Stop", a track inspired by Sixties Motown and the group Martha and the Vandellas. In addition to this, the album also included tracks by some acts on Warner Bros. Records, namely Club Nouveau, Scritti Politti and Michael Davidson. Commercially unsuccessful and unknown in the US, these groups needed a platform to project their songs, and including them in a Madonna album seemed like the right thing to do for Warner. Two tracks by Duncan Faure and Coati Mundi were included on the soundtrack at the request of Madonna since they were her friends. Despite her only performing four of the nine tracks on the album, Who's That Girl was marketed as a Madonna album, with only her face and name appearing on the cover art.|$|E
2500|$|Apollo was recommissioned in 1951 {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of the Korean War. Following a refit she joined the Home Fleet and remained in commission for the next ten years. In 1953 she took part in the Fleet Review to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. [...] She was paid off and returned to the Reserve in 1961, was put on the Disposal List the next year, and sold for <b>breaking-up</b> by Hughes Bolckow at Blyth, Northumberland, where she arrived in November 1962.|$|E
2500|$|On 21 December, in the {{approach}} to Bungo Suido (Bungo Channel), Sailfish intercepted six large freighters escorted by three destroyers. With five torpedoes left, she fired a spread of three stern tubes, scoring two hits on the largest target. Diving to escape {{the approach}}ing destroyers, the submarine detected <b>breaking-up</b> noises as Uyo Maru (...) went to the bottom; destroyers counterattacked with 31 depth charges, [...] "some very close". Sailfish terminated her tenth patrol at Pearl Harbor on 5 January 1944. She claimed three ships for , plus damage to one for , {{believed to be the}} most successful patrol by tonnage to date; postwar, it was reduced to two ships and (less Uyo Maru) [...]|$|E
2500|$|On 24, November 1960, an Italian Inquiry board {{announced}} its finding that a lightning strike had brought down Flight 891. [...] "The <b>breaking-up</b> in flight {{was due to}} the explosion of the fuel vapors contained in tank No.7, followed immediately by either an explosion of pressure or a further explosion in tank No.6. In the absence of other significant concrete evidence, taking into account the stormy weather conditions, with frequent electric discharges, existing in the area {{at the time of the}} crash, it may be assumed that the explosion of the fuel vapors contained in tank No.7 was set off, through the outlet pipes, by igniting of the gasoline vapors issuing from these pipes as a consequence of static electricity discharges (streamer corona) which developed on the vent outlets." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in the morning, Sailfish fired another {{spread of}} three torpedoes, from only , scoring two final hits. Loud {{internal}} explosions and <b>breaking-up</b> noises were heard while the submarine dived {{to escape a}} depth charge attack. Abruptly, a cruiser appeared and, fearing that she would broach the surface, Sailfish went to , losing a chance at this new target. Shortly afterwards, the carrier Chūyō (...) went to the bottom, the first aircraft carrier sunk by an American submarine in the war, and the only major Japanese warship sunk by enemy action in 1943. In an ironic twist, Chūyō was carrying American prisoners of war from , the same boat that had helped locate and rescue Sailfish—then Squalus—over four years before. Twenty of the 21 US crew members from Sculpin were killed. None, however, were of the original rescue crew. 1,250 Japanese were also killed.|$|E
2500|$|The {{supporting}} {{tour for}} Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights nearly {{resulted in the}} band <b>breaking-up</b> once again, but also saw HIM playing the United States for the first time; a one-off show organized by professional skateboarder and television personality Bam Margera. Following a two month break in early 2002, HIM regrouped and began rehearsing material for another album. Valo later credited the tour for Deep Shadow and Brilliant Highlights for bringing the band closer together, which culminated in their fourth album, entitled Love Metal. The album saw HIM once again working with producer Hiili Hiilesmaa, and was viewed by the band {{as a reaction to}} the difficulties they faced during Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights. According to Valo: [...] "After what we considered a disappointment with Deep Shadows and Brilliant Highlights, because there were so many chefs in the kitchen, we wanted to be a band [...] that we control what we do, and everybody else can fuck-off." [...] Love Metal was also the band's first album to make prominent use of the band's logo, the heartagram, on its cover, which Valo called [...] "a statement of intent [...] musically, visually and ideologically." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album's lead single, [...] "Dance", {{was written}} by Alexandra Prinz and Michael Gordon Lange, and is {{described}} as [...] "an uptempo song with a catchy melody." [...] Immediately after its release, the song was predicted by critics to set a new trend in Filipino music. Jojo Panaligan of Manila Bulletin recalled how Nina isn't new to the dance floor anymore, since her first two lead singles, [...] "Heaven" [...] and [...] "Make You Mine", displayed the same groovy vibe. However, none of the two sounds as aggressive as [...] "Dance" [...] in terms of tempo and arrangement. Nina explained her thoughts on the simple reinvention, saying [...] "Few know I love to dance and I’ve always wanted to show that side of me." [...] Lyrically, the song talks {{about a woman who}} wants to get back together with her lover after <b>breaking-up</b> with him. While the verses describe her desire for the relationship, the chorus was written in an opposite manner, where she goes to the club and dances her way to forgetting her lover: [...] "In the club I will raise my hands / I just wanna dance, dance, dance / On the thoughts of a new romance / I just wanna dance, dance, dance." [...] According to FORG of PhilCharts.com, the song [...] "has an irresistible beat that makes for a good club banger." ...|$|E
2500|$|Razorblade Romance was {{released}} on 24 January 2000, peaking at number one in Finland, Austria and Germany, number eight in Switzerland, and at number 78 in the Netherlands. The album eventually went double platinum in Finland, triple gold in Germany, and gold in Austria. Four further singles were released from the album, all of which reached the top five on the Finnish Singles Chart. All singles also received music videos, with two being produced for [...] "Gone with the Sin", while another was filmed for [...] "Wicked Game", this time in England. Razorblade Romance was mostly well received by critics. Soundi gave the album {{four out of five}} stars, and Borivoj Krgin of Blabbermouth.net called it [...] "yet another amazingly crafted album from Europe's best-kept secret." [...] Antti J. Ravelin of Allmusic was mixed in his review however, calling the album over-produced, but still commending the songwriting. Nevertheless, HIM were awarded [...] "Band of the Year", and [...] "Album of the Year" [...] for Razorblade Romance at the 2000 Emma Awards, as well as the [...] "Viewers' Choice Award" [...] and [...] "Video of the Year" [...] for [...] "Join Me in Death" [...] at the 2000 VIVA Comet Awards. During the supporting tour for Razorblade Romance, HIM played their first shows in the United Kingdom, starting at The Garage in London. The touring cycle and promotional work for the album exhausted the band, to the point where Valo nearly jumped off the balcony of a hotel, before being pulled back by friends, while Salminen ended up in the emergency room after a prank gone wrong. This resulted in HIM nearly <b>breaking-up,</b> until things settled down, and the band began rehearsing for another album.|$|E
60|$|The <b>breaking-up</b> of {{the camp}} was as the <b>breaking-up</b> of a long frost and the first scent of spring. There was a {{brightness}} in every man's face and a gay elasticity in all their movements. But when {{the order of the}} day informed them that they must prepare for instant combat, and that in eight-and-forty hours they would probably be in face of the enemy, the hearts of the young recruits fluttered with strange excitement, and the veterans nodded to each other with grim delight.|$|E

60|$|Long {{after their}} school days were over, the six girls kept the white jerseys they wore at the <b>breaking-up</b> festival, as relics of the J.

60|$|There was {{now much}} resting and sleeping.

And, in the anthracitic coals, this process appears to have gone to such a length, as to destroy the original structure altogether, and to replace it by a completely carbonized substance.|$|E

60|$|The {{first day}} of term cannot be {{considered}} a cheerful occasion. As the boys arrive on the previous evening, they {{have so much to}} tell each other, are so full of what they have been doing, that the chatter and laughter are as great as upon the night preceding the <b>breaking-up.</b> In the morning, however, all this is changed. As they take their places at their desks and open their books, a dull, heavy feeling takes possession of the boys, and the full consciousness that they are at the beginning of another half year's work weighs heavily on their minds.|$|E
60|$|This was {{a splendid}} beginning, and the hunters were loud in their {{congratulations}} of each other, while Bunco skinned the tiger. But the reader must not suppose that {{we intend to}} chronicle every incident of this kind. We record this as a specimen of their work during the following three weeks. They did not indeed shoot a tiger daily, but they bagged several within that period, besides a number of deer and other game. We must hasten, however, to tell of an event which put a sudden stop to our hero's hunting at that time, and resulted in the <b>breaking-up</b> of that hitherto united and harmonious party.|$|E
60|$|I well {{remember}} though, how {{the distant}} {{idea of the}} holidays, after seeming for an immense {{time to be a}} stationary speck, began to come towards us, and to grow and grow. How from counting months, we came to weeks, and then to days; and how I then began to be afraid that I should not be sent for and when I learnt from Steerforth that I had been sent for, and was certainly to go home, had dim forebodings that I might break my leg first. How the <b>breaking-up</b> day changed its place fast, at last, from the week after next to next week, this week, the day after tomorrow, tomorrow, today, tonight--when I was inside the Yarmouth mail, and going home.|$|E

Feeble as he was, she seemed to adopt him willingly for her protector. And the Doctor never afterwards shrank from his duty nor quailed beneath it, but bore himself like a man, striving, amid the sloth of age and the <b>breaking-up</b> of intellect, to earn the competency which he had failed to accumulate even in his most vigorous days.|$|E

She used to bring down strange accounts of her startling adventures in the slums, and relate them in a rattling style, interluded with slang, being evidently delighted to shock and puzzle her hearers; but still she was always good-natured in deed if not in word, and Lord Northmoor was very grateful for her offer of hospitality to Herbert, who was coming to London for his preliminary examination.|$|E
