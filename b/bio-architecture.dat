It was founded in 1987 by Rose and Johan Van Lengen, author of the grassroots construction manual 'The Barefoot Architect'. This book has gained popularity worldwide through its advocation and detailed instruction on appropriate technology and natural building techniques for builders, architects and students. The <b>bio-architecture</b> school was established to provide a place in which students can share and learn these techniques hands-on.The name TIBÁ comes from the Tupi language (Brazilian Amazonian tribe) meaning [...] "A place where many people meet".|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{determination}} of the thermal properties of a building envelope is fundamental for the correct design of energy efficient constructions. Opaque walls can be easily modeled as parallel and homogeneous layers, being characterized by a monodimensional thermal flux which allows to evaluate the thermal transmittance with analytical models. These procedures are well established and they lead to reliable results; however, {{it is important to}} verify the actual performance with in situ thermal transmittance measurements. This analysis is more important when the wall performance is high, being closely linked to economic assessments. The paper presents the results of a measurement campaign of in situ thermal transmittance, performed in some buildings in the Umbria Region (Italy), designed implementing <b>bio-architecture</b> solutions. The analyzed walls were previously monitored with thermographic surveys in order to assess the correct application of the sensors. Results of the investigation show that in situ thermal transmittance measurements and theoretical calculated U-value are not in perfect agreement. The mismatch becomes important for monolithic structures such as walls made of thermal blocks without insulating layers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a detailed LCA study of a low-energy consumption building (thermal energy for heating equal to 11 kWh/m 2 year) located in Perugia, Italy, according to European ISO 14040 and 14044. The building matches the criteria of environmental sustainability and <b>bio-architecture,</b> complying with the "PassivHaus" standard. All life cycle phases were included in the research: acquisition and production of materials, on-site construction and use/maintenance, demolition and material disposal (100 % landfilling and demolition with waste recycling). A life span of 70 years was considered. The research was therefore focused on cradle-to-grave life, based on data collected by authors, integrated with data from the literature. In particular the study was carried out to analyze: the benefits due to the use of recycled materials, a solar PV (during the utilization years) and the final demolition of the building. The LCA modeling was performed using the SimaPro software application, connected to the ecoinvent database. The results show that applying energy saving measures (highly insulated building envelope and passive-house standard, solar PV, waste recycling and recycled products in pre-production phase) could significantly decrease the impact of modern dwellings, with the consciousness that new ways of building do not always provide a positive environmental outcome...|$|E

In fact, the aim of biodiversity conservation included in each rule for a natural protected area requires the application of eco friendly technologies and sustainable strategies for the protection of the natural heritage. In the proposed approach, three aspects of tourist accommodations have been considered: the system component, the building envelope and the integration between them. As a result, the architectural structures designed, including the materials, shape, energy efficiency, modularity and removability, are in line with the standards of <b>bio-architecture.</b> The materials used comply with the technical requirements and the technological needs of tourist accommodations, are mostly recycled or reusable and come from the surrounding area, so they can b...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{oral cavity}} {{contains}} many structures compressed {{in a small}} area. It is exposed to chronic or recurrent, physical and chemical trauma leading to mucosal reactions (e. g. hyperplasia, dysplasia and tumors). For a long time, our group has been studying the expression of some metalloproteinases (MMP- 2, MMP- 9) in healthy and pathological human oral mucosa through immunohistochemistry and RT-PCR to investigate the entity of the remodelling process in the different cases. Matherials and Methods. In this paper we investigate a sample of normal oral mucosa and four pathological samples (mucocele, fibroma, dysplasia and carcinoma). We identified the localization of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 through immunohistochemistry and gene expression through RT-PCR analysis. Results. In control sample we identified a weak expression of both metalloproteinases (MMP- 2, MMP- 9) in the upper epithelial layers. The reactivity of the two enzymes is emphasized with higher intensity in pathological samples where a strong inflammatory activity is present (e. g. hyperplasia, dysplasia) or {{where there is a}} distruption of the architecture (as in tumors) while in localized lesions a functional silence is detected (mucocele). Particularly, in lesions like hyperplasia and dysplasia where (though it is present a inflammatory condition) the <b>bio-architecture</b> is preserved, the immunoreactivity is expressed only in the upper epithelial cell layers; while in more serious lesions (like tumors), where the architecture is fully disorganizated, the immunoreactivity is expressed also in deeper epithelial layers, in few connnective cells and in vessels wall. Qualitative RT-PCR analysis confirmed the expression of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 in both normal and pathological oral mucosa samples. Conclusions. Our data suggest that there is a relationship between the increase of MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 expression and the entity of morphological disorganization according with the well known role of these enzymes...|$|E

In particular, policies and actions should be planned considering the latest and best available knowledge, analyzing at the same time all the related impacts on the area of intervention. In this context, the purpose of this paper is to describe an approach for designing sustainable tourist accommodations that allow the fruition of areas characterized by high environmental values minimizing the related impacts on the surrounding environment and sensitizing users towards preservation and conservation of natural resources. In the proposed approach three aspects of tourist accommodation have been considered: the system component, the building envelope and the integration between them. As a result, the architectural structures designed, including their materials, shape, energy efficiency, modularity and removability, are in line with the standards of <b>bio-architecture.</b> The materials used, complying with the technical requirements and the technological needs of the tourist accommodations, are mostly recycled or reusable, coming from the surrounding area or of easy integration in the landscape. The components, that constitute the accommodations, are easy to assemble and disassemble for reuse them in another area, without changing the environmental conditions in the site. Some elements are precast and completed on site with local materials, moreover the modularity allows a high adaptability to different environmental and morphological conditions. To apply these architectural structures even in places without services and distribution networks of energy and water, special attention has been given to innovative and sustainable energy solutions: Liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) has been used as the only energy vector, combined with a cogeneration plant to provide heat and electric energy as well as with particular building envelopes that allow the transfer of LPG into the walls for provide energy to innovative gas appliances. Lastly, in order to assess the environmental impact of the proposed approach, it has been analyzed the environmental insertion of these structures for tourist accommodation in the Circeo National Park, in Italy...|$|E
