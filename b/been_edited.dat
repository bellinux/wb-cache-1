5|$|An {{unabridged}} {{edition of}} Anne Frank's work {{was published in}} 1995. This version included Anne's description of her exploration of her own genitalia and her puzzlement regarding sex and childbirth, a passage that had previously <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> out by Otto Frank. When Gail Horalek of Northville, Michigan, learned in March 2013 that her daughter's seventh-grade class was using this edition of the diary in class, she {{filed a complaint with}} the school district asking that an edited version be used instead. Horalek, who described the passage as pornographic, said the school should have obtained prior approval from parents before assigning the book. In 2010, school officials in Culpeper County, Virginia, stopped assigning the unabridged version after similar complaints were lodged.|$|E
5|$|Caragiale {{continued}} to be hailed as a relevant writer during the ten years following his death, and his wors went through new critical editions. Pajere was published in spring 1936, having <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> by Marica Caragiale-Sion and Alexandru Rosetti. Later in the year, a volume of collected works, Opere, was published by Rosetti and featured prints made by Mateiu Caragiale at various moments during his lifetime. Large portions of the diaries kept by Mateiu Caragiale are lost. The transcript made by Perpessicius was criticized for having selectively discarded much content, while originals kept by Rosetti were mysteriously lost during the Legionnaires' Rebellion of 1941. Additional notes, which notably featured Caragiale's criticism of his father, were preserved for a while by Șerban Cioculescu, before being borrowed to Ecaterina Logadi, Ion Luca's daughter, and never recovered. A significant number of his drawings and paintings, which Vianu assumed had survived by 1936, have also been misplaced.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be today, as a step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E
50|$|The bulk of {{the issues}} <b>were</b> <b>edited</b> by Allan Asherman and later by Paul Levitz and then Cary Burkett; {{individual}} issues <b>were</b> <b>edited</b> by Carl Gafford, Bob Rozakis, and Neal Pozner.|$|R
50|$|The Gothic {{version is}} Ulfilas' translation, and <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by Junius from the Codex Argenteus. The Anglo-Saxon version <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by Thomas Marshall. Junius' Gothic {{glossary}} (above) was included, along with Marshall's notes.|$|R
50|$|An {{edition of}} Bossuet's sermons <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by Abbé Lebarq in 6 vols. (Paris, 1890, 1896), as the Œuvres oratoires de Bossuet. His {{complete}} works <b>were</b> <b>edited</b> by Lachat in 31 vols. (Paris, 1862-1864).|$|R
5|$|De sacramento altaris, {{dealing with}} the eucharist and passover, is Baldwin's longest {{surviving}} work, in 12manuscripts. It also includes a discussion of martyrdom that reads much like a vindication of Becket's status as a martyr. It was first printed in 1662, and has more recently <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> and published in the series Sources Chrétiennes, as volumes 93 and 94, in 1963. Others works include 22 sermons, and a work on faith, De commendatione fidei, that only survives in two manuscripts, although another five {{are known to have}} existed. One of the missing manuscripts survived until at least the mid-1600s, as it formed the basis of the first printed edition of De commendatione fidei in 1662. The modern critical edition of De commendatione was published, along with the sermons, in 1991 as Balduini de Forda Opera: Sermones, De Commendatione Fidei. with the De commendatione fidei translated into English in 2000.|$|E
5|$|On March 16, 2003, GSN {{was allowed}} to air the episodes, {{including}} a few previously edited-out portions, {{as part of a}} two-hour documentary called Big Bucks: The Press Your Luck Scandal, hosted and narrated by Tomarken. The documentary was produced by and aired on GSN (in association with Lionsgate and FremantleMedia, the latter of which now owns the rights to Press Your Luck), and broke all previous viewership records for the network. The Big Bucks documentary included additional footage, directly from the original master tapes, that had <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> out of the episodes for their initial broadcast. The original telecast was dedicated to the memory of Bill Carruthers, producer/creator of Press Your Luck, who had died before the airing.|$|E
5|$|Ralph wrote {{a sermon}} for {{the feast of}} the Assumption of the Virgin and it survives in some fifty Latin manuscripts, {{probably}} because it was thought to have been written by Anselm of Canterbury, until shown to be Ralph's in 1927. A surviving English translation of the sermon is also preserved in the manuscript British Library, Cotton Vespasian D. xiv. The Latin version, which Ralph was a translation of his originally spoken French version, has <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> and published in 1997. Ralph also had the monks of Christ Church, Canterbury search for documents relating to the privileges of Canterbury and had those documents copied into a manuscript which still survives, BM MS Cotton Cleopatra E. His seal {{is one of the first}} to take the usual form for bishop's seals, with Ralph standing, in full vestments including a mitre, and performing a benediction with his right hand while holding his crosier in his left. The seal took the form of a pointed oval.|$|E
50|$|The {{first two}} issues <b>were</b> <b>edited</b> by Card himself. The {{magazine}} <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by Edmund R. Schubert from June 2006 until June 2016. Scott Roberts {{took over as}} the editor beginning in July 2016.|$|R
50|$|The {{magazine}} <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by Hugo Gernsback until March 1929, {{when the}} Experimenter Publishing empire of Sidney and Hugo Gernsback {{was forced into}} bankruptcy; after that date it <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by Arthur H. Lynch.|$|R
50|$|The {{manuscript}} {{was discovered}} in 1872 in the Church of Sarezzano near Tortona. It <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by librarian of the Ambrosian Library in 1872 at Milan (2nd edition, 1885). It <b>was</b> <b>edited</b> by Jülicher.|$|R
5|$|The Book of Household Management has <b>been</b> <b>edited,</b> {{revised and}} {{enlarged}} several times since Isabella's death {{and is still}} in print as at 2016. Food writers have stated that the subsequent editions of the work were far removed from and inferior to the original version. Several cookery writers, including Elizabeth David and Clarissa Dickson Wright, have criticised Isabella's work, particularly her use of other people's recipes. Others, such as the food writer Bee Wilson, consider the censure overstated, and that Beeton and her work should be thought extraordinary and admirable. Her name has become associated with knowledge and authority on Victorian cooking and home management, and the Oxford English Dictionary states that by 1891 the term Mrs Beeton had become used as a generic name for a domestic authority. She is also considered a strong influence in the building or shaping of a middle-class identity of the Victorian era.|$|E
5|$|What is {{considered}} the first scholarly discussion of the Leges appeared in 1827 by George Philips, who did not reproduce the entire text in his Englische Reichsund Rechtsgeschichte, but did provide a couple of extracts along {{with a discussion of}} the sources of the work and a description of the work. In 1840, the Record Commission published an edition of the text that had <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> by Richard Price and Benjamin Thorpe. The next major production of the Leges was Felix Liebermann who produced three volumes of Gesetze der Angelsachsen between 1903 and 1916, with the Leges being one of the legal treatises being reproduced in the Gesetze. A modern translation, with the original Latin text on pages facing the translation, was published in 1972 by the Clarendon Press and edited by L. J. Downer, and includes updated commentary and manuscript information.|$|E
5|$|Zombi 2 {{serves as}} a sequel to Zombi, a re-edited Italian release of George A. Romero's 1978 film Dawn of the Dead; Zombi had <b>been</b> <b>edited</b> by Dario Argento and given a new score by the Italian band Goblin, and proved {{successful}} upon its release in Italy. As Italian copyright law allows any film to be marketed as a sequel to another work, the film was quickly greenlit and financed by producer Fabrizio De Angelis. Enzo G. Castellari was offered to direct Zombi 2, but turned it down as {{he did not feel}} he would be the right director for a horror film. Director Lucio Fulci was De Angelis' second choice for the project, and was hired based on his handling of violent scenes in his previous films Sette note in nero and Non si sevizia un paperino.|$|E
