Stephen Holden of The New York Times described it as a [...] "big-band blues [...] in which she endorses sexual spanking [...] a calculated bid for outrage". Ray Boren from The Deseret News described [...] "Hanky Panky" [...] as [...] "naughty", comparing it to the 1928 jazz song [...] "Makin' Whoopee" [...] by Eddie Cantor. Dave Tianen from The Milwaukee Sentinel, while reviewing I'm Breathless noted that [...] "one aspect of Madonna remains constant even when you push her back in time.

This led many to believe that Perry had initially been lip-syncing the performance. NRJ later released an apology to Perry, stating that she had <b>been</b> <b>singing</b> live but that the wrong mix of the song was played over her live vocals, which resulted in her being visually out of sync with the backing track.|$|E
500|$|At the 1991 Academy Awards, Madonna {{appeared}} with singer Michael Jackson as her date and performed [...] "Sooner or Later".

She wore a long, tight, white dress designed by Bob Mackie and covered in sequins and pearls. On her neck she wore $20 million worth of jewelry from Harry Winston. Taraborrelli recalled that Madonna had appropriated every move and mannerisms of Marilyn Monroe for the performance, making it {{a tribute to the}} actress. When she appeared onstage, there was technical difficulty resulting in the mike not appearing from below the ground, and a stage-hand passing it to her. According to Madonna's brother Christopher Ciccone, she was quite nervous during the performance; [...] "Had she <b>been</b> <b>singing</b> to an audience of screaming fans, she wouldn't have been at all nervous. But this time she was performing in an auditorium full of established actors and actresses, a group of people to which she really didn't belong, who didn't respect her as an actress but whose respect she desperately wanted to win." ...|$|E
