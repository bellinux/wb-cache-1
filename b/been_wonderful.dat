I'm putting myself into this very dark place which I know sadly {{is a reality}} for so many women. Zainab's confidence has been steadily eroded. She's feeling isolated and has fallen under Yusef's control. He wants revenge. She is totally in his power. I had to show this can happen to any woman, no matter how strong she seems. Zainab was strong and not naive, but a woman is vulnerable if the man hits the right psychological weak spots. But both Ace and I have {{found it hard to}} do. I've known Ace {{for a long time and}} we're good friends. He has <b>been</b> <b>wonderful</b> to work with on this and very concerned about me all the way through." [...] Wadia has been given advice on the storyline from the Roshni refuge in Birmingham, which specializes in abuse within Asian families.|$|E

500|$|Episode eight {{features}} Paul Williams, who likened Daft Punk's personas to {{a character}} {{from the film}} Phantom of the Paradise, in which he starred. He also added that their masks hide who they are from the public and allow the listeners to enjoy the music for what it is. Paul Williams worked with the duo at Henson Recording Studios, the former studio of A Records where he had worked previously, including his compositions for Jim Henson's films featuring the Muppets, such as [...] "Rainbow Connection". He also stated that the song he penned was to be sung {{from the point of}} view of an unidentified first person, setting the emotion, but the lyrics came from the music itself. Paul Williams said that he felt vulnerable while writing the record, and said he writes best when he is allowed to be honest and vulnerable, a situation that Daft Punk allowed. He also stated that his sobriety added a sense of wonder to the song he wrote, as every day for him being sober has <b>been</b> <b>wonderful</b> compared to his prior life of excess.|$|E
500|$|On 28 October 2009 it was {{announced}} that Windsor had quit the show and would leave in 2010 after 15 years. She said: [...] "EastEnders has <b>been</b> <b>wonderful</b> to me and it's no secret that it changed my life all of those years ago. I'll be so sad to leave Peggy behind; she's such a wonderful character to play. I have had the pleasure of working with a marvellous cast and crew and have made many lasting good friends. To have had the honour of showing the Queen around the set is something that will stay with me forever." [...] Executive producer Diederick Santer said: [...] "Barbara has contributed so much to EastEnders over the last 15 years, plus countless episodes, and countless amazing storylines. Peggy Mitchell is a truly iconic character, and along with Steve McFadden and Ross Kemp, Barbara has made the Mitchells the premier family of British soap." [...] Windsor filmed her final scene on 16 July 2010. Peggy's final episode, which aired on 10 September 2010, was preceded by a number of television trailers in August and a new section on the EastEnders website dedicated to the character. The episode ended with a special reworking of the piano version of the EastEnders theme tune known as [...] "Julia's Theme", called [...] "Peggy's Theme".

2500|$|Richard Traubner, {{writing in}} Opera News, disagrees: [...] "Ivanhoe ... {{reflects}} the ballad-rich British grand operas Sullivan grew up with, by Balfe (The Bohemian Girl) or Wallace (Maritana). The skill and flair Sullivan exhibits in the Savoy operettas in humor, gaiety and superb word-setting are barely required in Ivanhoe. It sounds instead like {{an extension of}} the hoary oratorio form popular in Victorian Britain ... with its plethora of hymn-like numbers interspersed with ballads of no particular interest and some strong ensembles." [...] Traubner continues, [...] "Sullivan's score would have <b>been</b> <b>wonderful</b> for a film, with its numerous Korngoldian fanfares and stirring, very English-national choruses. The long drinking scene in act 1, with its 'Glory to those who fight for the true Cross', and the 'Ho, Jolly Jenkin' ensemble with Friar Tuck, also referring to drinking, are the most exciting things in the opera. [...] Sadly, the dramatic arias required for an opera to achieve universal popularity are largely absent. ... Rebecca's prayer does have a certain Near Eastern aroma".|$|E
2500|$|Team {{captain and}} quarterback Boss Weeks wrote {{a review of}} the 1902 season for the 1903 yearbook, the Michiganensian. Weeks opened his review as follows: [...] "The story of the {{football}} season of 1902 is easily told. Champions of the West, with no one to dispute it." [...] In the same publication, Fielding Yost published a 15-point essay entitled, [...] "Why Michigan Is Great." [...] Some of Yost's points included the following:"First. Speed. Both as a team and in the individual players, Michigan was speedy. ...Second. Knowledge of the Game. All of the Michigan players were well versed in the fundamental principles of the game in every department. ... Third. Endurance. the men are of wonderful endurance. [...] This is much due to their fine training ...Fourth. [...] Spirit. Among the players there is the finest of fellow-feeling. The men's love of the game had helped give them the proper spirit. They have the desire to win -- the spirit of fighters.Fifth. Team Work. Michigan's team work has <b>been</b> <b>wonderful.</b> ... Seventh. Weight. Michigan had a well-balanced team. The average was 182 pounds very equally distributed. But one man weighed over 200 pounds (Carter) and but one less than 170 pounds (Weeks at quarterback).Eighth. Style of Attack. Michigan varied her onslaughts very much, depending largely upon the style of defense used by the team opposing it. Every man on the team was used to carry the ball, thus distributing the work.Ninth. Generalship. Captain Weeks deserves great credit for Michigan's success. As a leader of forces and strategist I believe he has no equal on the gridiron today. ...Tenth. Punting. In Sweeley, Michigan has one of the greatest kickers in the country. Never has he had a kick blocked in his four years' play at Michigan. ...Twelfth. Defense. Michigan's defensive playing has <b>been</b> <b>wonderful.</b> No team was able to cross Michigan's goal on straight football {{in the last two years}} ... Fifteenth. Met All Teams. Michigan's schedule was far harder than that usually arranged for a team. She played five state universities and all the strong Western teams." ...|$|E

[...] Cutshall would take a men’s concert T-shirt, and have Burton put it on. [...] "She’s also very, very slender, so I’ll taper them down to her figure. We come out of it with kind of a one-o-f-a-kind rock T-shirt. I take something and then turn it into my own piece of clothing," [...] said Cutshall.

[...] Tang forces achieved initial victories against Tuyuhun forces; in response, Tuyuhun burned the grass on grazing fields to try to cut off the Tang horses' food supplies, and the Tang generals mostly believed that they should retreat them. [...] Hou advocated attacking, however, and Li jing agreed, pushing deep into Tuyuhun territory and greatly defeating them, capturing the wives and sons of Tuyuhun's Busabo Khan Murong Fuyun. [...] Murong Fuyun's son Murong Shun surrendered, and Murong Fuyun was soon killed by his subordinates. [...] Emperor Taizong created Murong Shun the new khan, and Tang forces largely withdrew, although Li Daliang remained.|$|E
