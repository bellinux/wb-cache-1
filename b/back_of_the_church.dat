5|$|The stone church's three-stage tower has six bells, {{three of}} which {{were made by the}} local Bilbie family, to whom a {{redundant}} bell at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> serves as a memorial. The interior of the church is largely Victorian and includes 156 angels in wood and stone. The churchyard includes graves and memorials to local residents and the base of a 14th-century cross. The remains of the cross from Morteon were moved to Chew Stoke when their original site was flooded during the construction of Chew Valley Lake in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|Slavery {{did not end}} in New York State until July 4, 1827, and, {{like many}} men of his day, Stanton's father was a slaveowner. Peter Teabout, a slave in the Cady {{household}} who was later freed in Johnstown, took care of Stanton and her sister Margaret. While she {{makes no mention of}} Teabout's position as a slave in her family's household, he is remembered with particular fondness by Stanton in her memoir, Eighty Years & More. Among other things, she reminisces about the pleasure she took in attending the Episcopal church with Teabout, where she and her sisters enjoyed sitting with him in the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> rather than alone in front with the white families of the congregation. It seems it was, however, not immediately the fact that her family owned at least one slave, but her exposure to the abolition movement as a young woman visiting her cousin, Gerrit Smith, in Peterboro, New York, that led to her staunch abolitionist sentiments.|$|E

25|$|The Stations of the Cross {{underneath}} the gallery {{and around the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> are made of alabaster. They were created by the Mayer and Company of Munich and London {{at a cost of}} $1,800 and installed around 1891.|$|E
25|$|The {{interiors}} is of curved ceiling made of {{wood with}} historical images and accounts {{at the top of}} the walls. Above the main altar is the retable, in which is the icon enshrined behind protective glass. There are verandas inside the church which makes the shrine elegant. At the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> are staircases leading to a window exactly at the back of the Virgin Mary wherein devotees can touch the dress of Our Lady.|$|E
25|$|On major feast days, a Litiy will {{be served}} at this point. The clergy and the cantors will process to the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> {{in front of an}} icon of the feast or saint being commemorated. After the cantors chant hymns {{pertaining}} to the feast, the deacon or priest will read a litany with several long peititions, to which the cantors respond with Kyrie eleison ("Lord, Have Mercy") many times. The priest ends with a long prayer invoking the intercessions of the saints and the Theotokos.|$|E

25|$|To the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> {{stood the}} Oldham Corporation Tram Depot. In 1907 the church bought from the Corporation {{a strip of}} land between the two {{buildings}} measuring 196 square yards {{at a cost of}} £61.5.0. In 1910 the congregation considered whether it might buy the Depot as well but nothing came of this. In 1912 the church committee wrote to the Tramways Manager complaining that the grinding of trams often disturbed worship. The Manager was asked to instruct drivers to go very slowly past the church and to stop ringing the bell at the terminus during service time.|$|E
25|$|One {{thing that}} is {{different}} about the Basilica of Our Lady of Piat was its entrance arch. It was at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> and one has to go around from the entrance to see the church façade. The arch has the phrase, Basilica Minore Nuestra Señora de Piat (Minor Basilica of Our Lady of Piat). Our Lady of Piat Basilica sports a simple facade flanked with a tall belfry. It {{is on top of}} a hill in the midst of Cagayan River with the intention of avoiding floods brought about by the seasonal overflowing of the river. The church structure is mainly made of red bricks, which is common among churches in Cagayan Valley. It is a contrast to old churches made of limestone and coral stone {{in many parts of the}} Philippines.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{aspects of}} the {{missions}} were the long arcades (corridors) which flanked all interior and many exterior walls. The arches were Roman (half-round), while the pillars were usually square and made of baked brick, rather than adobe. The overhang created by the arcade had a dual function: it provided a comfortable, shady place to sit after a hard-day's work, and (more importantly) it kept rainfall away from the adobe walls. The mainstay of any mission complex was its capilla (chapel). The design of chapels overall followed that of Christian churches in Europe, but tended to be comparatively long and narrow due {{to the size of}} lumber available along the California coast. Each church had a main section (the nave), a baptistry near the front entrance, a sanctuary (where the altar was located), and a sacristy at the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> where materials used to celebrate Mass were stored and where the priests vested. In most churches, a stairway near the main entrance led up to a choir loft.|$|E

500|$|Just {{like the}} other towns of Bohol, the church and convent of Maribojoc were located on the [...] "uptown", {{a portion of the}} town that is usually {{elevated}} compared {{to the rest of the}} town, called [...] "downtown". The <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> faced downtown and the sea. The uptown and downtown portions of Maribojoc were connected by a stone stairway finished in 1842. Instead of a plaza in front of the church, a ravine and the plaza were located on either side.|$|E
500|$|In {{response}} to the persecution, Pope Pius XI had the [...] "Mit brennender Sorge" [...] ("With Burning Concern") Encyclical smuggled into Germany for Passion Sunday 1937 and read from every pulpit. It denounced the systematic hostility of the regime toward the church. In response, Goebbels renewed the regime's crackdown and propaganda against Catholics. His speech of 28 May in Berlin in front of 20,000 party members, which was also broadcast on the radio, attacked the Catholic church as morally corrupt. As {{a result of the}} propaganda campaign, enrolment in denominational schools dropped sharply, and by 1939 all such schools were disbanded or converted to public facilities. Harassment and threats of imprisonment led the clergy to be much more cautious in their criticism of the regime. Partly out of foreign policy concerns, Hitler ordered a scaling <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> struggle by the end of July 1937.|$|E
500|$|The oldest bell in {{the tower}} dates from 1698 and was cast by the Bilbie family who were bell founders and clockmakers based {{initially}} in the village. The Bilbie family produced more than 1,350 bells, which are hung in churches all over the West Country. Supplies of the tin and copper used to make bell metal were probably obtained from brass foundries in Kelston and Bristol. The metal was melted in a wood-burning furnace to over [...] and then poured into a mould made from loam, or foundry mud, from the River Chew. Others in St Andrew's are from the same maker are dated 1718 and 1731. The bells were tuned and re-hung into a new frame in 1908 and again in 1996 with a new bell from John Taylor's foundry in Loughborough replacing the treble. The redundant bell is now {{on display at the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> as a memorial to the Bilbies.|$|E

500|$|The sacristy {{was located}} behind the sanctuary. Another {{passageway}} {{lead from the}} sanctuary to the church convent. Unlike other churches, the convent of Maribojoc, built under the second term of Father Fernando Rubio, {{was attached to the}} <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> and parallel to the epistle transept, forming a continuous [...] "I" [...] pattern instead of the usual [...] "L" [...] pattern. The convent was a traditional bahay-na-bato, with its ground floor made of stone and the second floor made of contemporary materials. Parts of the convent were used as the St. Vincent Institute, a school and the church museum, which housed liturgical objects, old canonical books (Bautizos, Defuociones, Casamientos, Actas), relics of St. Vincent Ferrer and another relic of the Holy Cross brought by Father Soriano, SJ from Jerusalem. Another stone stairway {{at the back of the}} convent, finished in 1864, connected the downtown to the port and led to an octagonal tower.|$|E
500|$|The spire {{was never}} {{repaired}} and the tower was removed {{and replaced by}} a simpler structure; however, the clock was saved and eventually placed in another building on campus, the Stanford Clock Tower. [...] University trustees considered re-building the tower, and even looked at possible designs, but eventually chose not to rebuild it {{because they could not}} agree on its design. [...] The crossing structure, {{the only part of the}} building to remain relatively stable after the quake, also pushed the roof of the nave forward, causing the church's front facade to fall into the Inner Quad courtyard as it broke free, which resulted in the destruction of the entire north face of the building; as mosaic expert Joseph A. Taylor put it, [...] "its wondrous mosaic was blown out and totally destroyed". [...] The only mosaics not destroyed in the quake were the four angels that decorated the crossing dome's pendentives. [...] The <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church,</b> with several hundred feet of arcades, was also completely leveled because it too was not joined to the rest of the building.|$|E
500|$|There {{is another}} piscina {{in the south}} transept, {{although}} this is damaged, along with an alabaster effigy of SirDavid Craddock, who died in about 1384. The effigy was damaged in the Civil War, and was found buried under the chancel floor during the 19th-century restoration. SirDavid, who came from Nantwich, was once Mayor of Bordeaux, Justicar of Wales and a money-lender to RichardII. The south transept also contains a tomb dated 1614, which was transferred from the former St Chad's Church, Wybunbury in 1982. This is constructed of alabaster and limestone and includes effigies of SirThomas Smith, mayor and sheriff of Chester, and his wife, Anne. In addition the transept contains a number of brass memorials. At the <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> along the west wall are the Jubilee curtains which {{were made by the}} church's Tapestry Group to commemorate the silver jubilee of ElizabethII in 1977. [...] In the porch the stone vaulting dates from 1879 and it contains the carving of a green man, while {{on the outside of the}} porch are carvings of the Four Evangelists. The room over the porch houses a library of theological books, including a complete edition (which is thought to be unique) of the Sarum Hymns and Sequences, printed in 1539 by Wynkyn de Worde.|$|E
25|$|As Empress Zewditu's reign progressed, the {{difference}} in outlook gradually widened {{between her and her}} appointed heir, Ras Tafari Makonnen. Tafari was a moderniser, believing that Ethiopia needed to open itself to the world in order to survive. In this, he had <b>the</b> <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> many younger nobles. Zewditu, however, was a conservative, believing in <b>the</b> preservation <b>of</b> Ethiopian tradition. She had <b>the</b> strong <b>backing</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>church</b> in this belief. Slowly, however, Zewditu began to withdraw from active politics, leaving more and more power to Tafari. Under Tafari's direction, Ethiopia entered <b>the</b> League <b>of</b> Nations, and abolished slavery. Zewditu busied herself with religious activities, such as <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a number of significant churches.|$|R

2500|$|The choir organ, a {{counterpart}} of the pulpit, {{was made in}} 1746 by Nikolaus Rumel the elder. The famous Austrian composer Anton Bruckner counted it among his favourites.
