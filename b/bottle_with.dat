5|$|With {{contamination}} of the Excedrin at the source having been ruled out, investigators began to focus their investigation on the end-users of the product. The FBI began an investigation into possible product tampering having {{been the source of}} the poison. At the time, Excedrin was packaged in plastic bottles with the mouth of the bottle sealed with foil and the lid secured to the <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> plastic wrap.|$|E
5|$|Chest {{tubes are}} {{required}} in PSPs {{that have not}} responded to needle aspiration, in large SSPs (>50%), and in cases of tension pneumothorax. They are connected to a one-way valve system that allows air to escape, but not to re-enter, the chest. This may include a <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> water that functions like a water seal, or a Heimlich valve. They are not normally connected to a negative pressure circuit, as this would result in rapid re-expansion of the lung and a risk of pulmonary edema ("re-expansion pulmonary edema"). The tube is left in place until no air is seen to escape from it {{for a period of}} time, and X-rays confirm re-expansion of the lung.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's {{disease is a}} disease of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin which is often low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E
30|$|The model {{consisted}} of 40 blood culture <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> an inserted cannula with a needle-free closed connector. Twice a day, each line was manipulated while instilling 1 mL {{of two different}} fluids (saline and propofol). We manipulated the bottles as follows: ten <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> clean gloves and disinfecting connectors with alcohol (controls), ten <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> hands (no gloves), ten <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> gloves impregnated with a 0.5 McFarland (MF) solution of Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and ten <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> gloves impregnated with a 0.05 MF solution of SA. The bottles were incubated in a BACTEC System at 37 °C under continuous agitation up to 10 days. When a bottle turned positive, 100 μL of the fluid was cultured and incubated followed by microorganism identification using standard procedures.|$|R
60|$|Directly {{the first}} crate was, in {{accordance}} with his directions, carried into the parlour, the stranger flung himself upon it with extraordinary eagerness, and began to unpack it, scattering the straw with an utter disregard of Mrs. Hall's carpet. And from it he began to produce bottles--little fat bottles containing powders, small and slender bottles containing coloured and white fluids, fluted blue bottles labeled Poison, <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> round bodies and slender necks, large green-glass bottles, large white-glass <b>bottles,</b> <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> glass stoppers and frosted labels, <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> fine corks, <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> bungs, <b>bottles</b> <b>with</b> wooden caps, wine bottles, salad-oil bottles--putting them in rows on the chiffonnier, on the mantel, on the table under the window, round the floor, on the bookshelf--everywhere. The chemist's shop in Bramblehurst could not boast half so many. Quite a sight it was. Crate after crate yielded bottles, until all six were empty and the table high with straw; {{the only things that}} came out of these crates besides the bottles were a number of test-tubes and a carefully packed balance.|$|R

5|$|Shoe polish may be {{purchased}} pre-soaked into a hard sponge, {{which can be}} used to buff leather without needing to apply any additional polish to either the leather or the sponge. This is usually known as an applicator. A number of companies that manufacture shoe care products also sell a liquid shoe polish in a squeezable plastic <b>bottle,</b> <b>with</b> a small sponge applicator at the end. To decrease its viscosity, bottled polish usually has a very low wax content.|$|E
5|$|The basidia (spore-bearing cells) measure 24–33 by 6.6–8.8μm, {{and may be}} {{attached}} to anywhere from one to four spores, although four-spored basidia are most common. They are hyaline to sometimes somewhat yellowish, club-shaped or roughly cylindrical, and some have a slight constriction around the middle. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{on the edge of}} a gill) are abundant, forming a sterile band on the gill edge. They are hyaline, fusoid-ampullaceous (with a shape ranging from a spindle to a swollen <b>bottle),</b> <b>with</b> dimensions of 20–45 by 5–8.2μm, and have a filamentous neck measuring 6–11 by 1.6–2.5μm. The pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) are scattered, similar to the cheilocystidia in form and size, hyaline, and some have bifurcated or branched necks.|$|E
5|$|Akash {{attends the}} bank {{settlement}} and reconciles with several friends {{with whom he}} had fallen out, as well as with his estranged father. Meanwhile, Kiara cannot stop thinking about Akash, and on the 31st she realises that she has fallen for him. Kunal discovers this and drops Kiara off at the airport. She reaches the bridge, but finds herself alone, believing she will never see Akash again. Just then he arrives. The pair go out to sea to die. Akash throws a beer <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> a note in it, which Kiara gets and reads before he proposes to her. Surprised, she accepts, and the couple share a kiss while the Coast Guard rescues them. As the credits roll, Akash and Kiara are shown two years later, married with their baby boy.|$|E

5|$|High-quality {{glass from}} Roman {{manufacturers}} in Alexandria and Syria was exported to {{many parts of}} Asia, including Han China. The first Roman glassware discovered in China is a blue soda-lime glass bowl dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a glass <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang. Roman and Persian glassware {{has been found in}} a 5th-century AD tomb of Gyeongju, Korea, capital of ancient Silla, east of China. Roman glass beads have been discovered as far as Japan, within the 5th-century AD Kofun-era Utsukushi burial mound near Kyoto.|$|E
5|$|Vainio's friends Heikki Kauppinen and Reijo Tani quit {{drinking}} in 1972, {{and at first}} Vainio found their decision odd. When Vexi Salmi was hired by Fazer in 1970, Vainio and Salmi started drinking together often and sometimes even came to work with hangovers. On one occasion, Vainio forgot that {{he was supposed to}} have finished the text of an advertising tune. When the deadline arrived, Vainio was too hung over to finish the lyrics and eventually Salmi agreed to help by writing the lyrics for Vainio's composition. Vainio's alcohol use increased in the 1970s, and his parents watched without being able to do anything about it. It is reported that Vainio would not go to sleep at night unless he had liquor under his bed, and he always kept a <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> him. Vainio began to realize that he could not live like this forever. By summer 1975 he decided that he needed to stop drinking altogether. He was especially helped in this decision through his meeting footballer Kai Pahlman, who told Vainio that he was surprised he was still alive. In late 1975, Vainio stayed sober for four months, but then caved in for a short time. In January 1976 he finally managed to {{quit drinking}} for good.|$|E

25|$|To {{investigate}} the debate, Harlow created inanimate surrogate mothers for the rhesus infants from wire and wood. Each infant became attached to its particular mother, recognizing its unique face and preferring it above all others. Harlow next chose to investigate if the infants had {{a preference for}} bare-wire mothers or cloth-covered mothers. For this experiment, he presented the infants with a clothed mother and a wire mother under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> food, and the cloth mother held no food. In the other situation, the cloth mother held the bottle, and the wire mother had nothing.|$|E

25|$|White fuming {{nitric acid}}, pure nitric acid or WFNA, {{is very close}} to {{anhydrous}} nitric acid. It is available as 99.9% nitric acid by assay. One specification for white fuming nitric acid is that it has a maximum of 2% water and a maximum of 0.5% dissolved NO2. Anhydrous nitric acid has a density of 1.513g/cm3 and has the approximate concentration of 24 molar. Anhydrous nitric acid is a colorless mobile liquid with a density of 1.512g/cm3, which solidifies at −42°C to form white crystals. As it decomposes to NO2 and water, it obtains a yellow tint. It boils at 83°C. It is usually stored in a glass shatterproof amber <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> twice the volume of head space to allow for pressure build up, but even with those precautions the bottle must be vented monthly to release pressure.|$|E
25|$|Harlow's {{experiments}} were controversial; they included creating inanimate surrogate mothers for the rhesus infants from wire and wood. Each infant became attached to its particular mother, recognizing its unique face and preferring it above all others. Harlow next chose to investigate if the infants had {{a preference for}} bare-wire mothers or cloth-covered mothers. For this experiment, he presented the infants with a clothed mother and a wire mother under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a <b>bottle</b> <b>with</b> food, and the cloth mother held no food. In the other situation, the cloth mother held the bottle, and the wire mother had nothing. Also later in his career, he cultivated infant monkeys in isolation chambers for up to 24 months, from which they emerged intensely disturbed. Some researchers cite the experiments {{as a factor in}} the rise of the animal liberation movement in the United States. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Harlow as the 26th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.|$|E
