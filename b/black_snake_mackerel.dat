5000|$|The <b>black</b> <b>snake</b> <b>{{mackerel}}</b> (Nealotus tripes) is {{a species}} of snake mackerel found worldwide in both tropical and temperate waters where they are found at depths of from 914 to 1646 m making diel vertical migrations from mesopelagic depths to the surface at night. It can reach a length of 25 cm SL though most do not exceed 15 cm SL. It is important to local peoples as a food fish. This species is currently the only known member of its genus, Nealotus.

40|$|Large, mesopelagic teleosts have a {{potentially}} keystone {{position in the}} ecology of the pelagic water column, yet remain relatively unstudied when compared to large, commercially important fishes of the epipelagic zone. In this study, the ecological roles of four large, vertically migrating teleosts, oilfish, Ruvettus pretiosus, escolar, Lepidocybium flavobrunneum, <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel,</b> Gempylus serpens, longnose lancetfish, Alepisaurus ferox, and shortnose lancetfish, Alepisaurus brevirostris, were examined. The stomachs of 61 oilfish, 35 escolar, 33 <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and 34 lancetfish were collected from nighttime, pelagic, longline fishing operations in the epipelagic zone of the western North Atlantic Ocean and Gulf of Mexico from 2007 to 2010. Stomach content analysis was used to determine predator-prey interactions. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were performed on white dorsal muscle tissue of 38 oilfish, 23 escolar, 28 <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and 19 lancetfish also sampled for stomach content analysis. Crustaceans were abundant prey of small oilfish, lancetfish, and to a lesser degree, <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and they were absent from large escolar diets. Lancetfish and <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> showed diverse diets that included crustaceans, polychaetes, gymnosomes, salps, cephalopods, and fishes. Large escolar stomachs contained only squid and fish. Stable isotope analyses placed small oilfish in the lowest trophic position of the group, followed by lancetfish and <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel,</b> and large escolar occupied the highest trophic position of the four species...|$|R

40|$|Large, mesopelagic teleost fishes have a {{potentially}} keystone {{position in the}} ecology of the pelagic water column, yet remain relatively unstudied when compared with large, commercially important, epipelagic fishes. Here, the ecological roles of four, large, vertically migrating teleosts were examined. Stomach content analyses were performed on 48 oilfish (Ruvettus pretiosis), 35 escolar (Lepidocybium flavobrunneum), 32 <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Gempylus serpens) and seven lancetfish (Alepisaurus spp.) collected from pelagic longline gear in the Western North Atlantic Ocean from 2007 to 2010. Of these specimens, stable carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses were also performed on white dorsal muscle tissue from 33 oilfish, 16 escolar, 27 <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> and seven lancetfish. Based on literature length-at-maturity values, all escolar, <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> and lancetfish specimens were mature, while 13 of the 33 oilfish were juveniles. Crustaceans, annelids, salps, cephalopods and teleosts were present in the stomachs and were presumed to be prey items. A Kruskal–Wallis test showed the four species to be isotopically segregated in both δ 13 C and δ 15 N. Escolar were the most depleted in δ 13 C, followed by adult oilfish, juvenile oilfish and lancetfish, with <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> the most enriched. The depletion in δ 13 C of adult oilfish and escolar may have been attributable to high C/N values, which were strongly correlated with length in oilfish, weakly correlated with length in escolar and moderately correlated with length in <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> and lancetfish. The high C/N was likely due to the high lipid concentration of these fishes. Other factors that {{may have contributed to the}} depletion in δ 13 C may include spawning or a change in carbon source within the ecosystem. Large escolar occupied the highest trophic level (δ 15 N = 10. 20), followed by <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> (δ 15 N = 9. 66), adult oilfish (δ 15 N = 9. 32), lancetfish (δ 15 N = 9. 05) and juvenile oilfish (δ 15 N = 7. 83). A marked change in oilfish δ 13 C and C/N at 30 – 35 cm fork length coincided with a presumed length-at-maturity...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> (Gempylus serpens) is {{a species}} of fish in the {{monotypic}} genus Gempylus, belonging to the family Gempylidae (which is also referred to generally as [...] "snake mackerels"). It is found worldwide in tropical and subtropical oceans between the latitudes of 42° N and 40° S; adults are known to stray into temperate waters. It is found {{to a depth of}} 600 m. Populations of the <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> from the Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific differ in vertebral count (51-55 versus 48-50) and number of first dorsal fin spines (30-32 versus 26-30), and so may represent separate species.|$|R

40|$|Stomach content {{analysis}} and carbon and nitrogen stable isotope analysis used in combination {{can provide a}} robust analysis of the diet and ecological role of organisms not possible for either technique used alone. This combined analysis methodology was applied to four mesopelagic teleost fishes (<b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> Gempylus serpens, lancetfish Alepisaurus spp., oilfish Ruvettus pretiosus, and escolar Lepidocybium flavobrunneum) collected from the South Atlantic Bight and Gulf of Mexico {{over a period of}} two years. These species are diel vertical migrators and the differences in the diets of these organisms is presently unknown. However, understanding their trophic role within the pelagic ecosystem is vital for on-going pelagic fisheries ecosystem modeling. Combined stomach content and stable isotope analyses were performed on these fishes and compared with species, length, weight, sex, location, and maturity. The results from the stomach content analyses show <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> as having the most diverse diet and escolar having the least diverse diet. The carbon to nitrogen ratios by percent (C/N) for <b>snake</b> <b>mackerel</b> and small oilfish are characteristic of proteinaceous organisms while the higher percent C/N ratios for escolar and large oilfish are characteristic of more lipid-rich tissues.
