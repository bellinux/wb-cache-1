40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} is increasingly {{controlled by the}} Swedish environmental quality objectives, adopted by the Swedish parliament. There {{is a need for}} a sewage system that can fulfill stringent requirements concerning the environment, recycling and resource use and hygiene. Additional environmental aspects in recent years are the impact of climate change, new knowledge about the effects of pharmaceuticals in water, the need for improved wastewater treatment and increased recycling of nutrients to agriculture.   This report has, from a future scenario of the year 2050, analyzed seven different systems for wastewater treatment and treatment of compostable biowaste from households in Eskilstuna. A future scenario was chosen based on that within a forty year period new challenges may arise which can result in higher demands on sewage treatment than those we see today. Another reason why the future scenario was established is that changes in wastewater treatment systems are slow to establish.   The analysis is mainly focused on the economical aspects but environmental aspects such as emissions to receiving waters and potential recycling of plant nutrients has also been evaluated briefly. The economical analysis was made from a new construction perspective. The economy model is constructed in Microsoft Office Excel and named URWARE Eko. The report also includes a section based on results from previous system studies.   A target image of Eskilstuna 2050 was initially created. Seven systems were then analyzed based on this target image. The seven different systems could be divided in to three main categories: conventional sewage system that were modified, source separated <b>blackwater</b> <b>systems</b> and a sewage plant with improved treatment technology in the form of membrane technology and reverse osmosis.   The results showed that it differed a factor of 1. 9 between the cheapest system (sludge recovery to productive land) and the most expensive (separated blackwater treated in a central treatment facility). All systems have a big recycling potential of phosphorus. <b>Blackwater</b> <b>systems</b> and wastewater plants with membrane technology and reverse osmosis are the best systems for recycling of other nutrients such as nitrogen, potassium and sulfur...|$|R

40|$|Recycling {{of plant}} {{nutrients}} in sewage products to arable land {{is regarded as}} a step towards a more sustainable society, as today’s use of scarce resources is a threat to future generations. Sewage sludge is the predominant sewage fertiliser product available today. However, the use of sewage sludge in agriculture is a controversial issue. Blackwater from separating systems seems to fulfil agricultural requirements on a fertiliser product to a higher degree than sewage sludge without many of the hazardous substances in sludge. The main objective {{of this study was to}} analyse environmental impact and resource use in systems integrating wastewater management and agriculture. The methodology used was based on LCA methodology. Three different wastewater systems were evaluated together with the agricultural production potentially affected. The first alternative (the Surahammar reference system) represented a system that a large part of the population in Surahammar is connected to today. Food waste disposers were installed in 50 % of the households, wastewater was treated in a conventional wastewater treatment plant and the sewage sludge was used for production of a soil conditioner. The second alternative (the sludge utilisation system) symbolised a wastewater system more commonly represented in Swedish municipalities, and included also agricultural use of the sewage sludge. The third alternative (the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system)</b> was based on a future vision of Surahammar. Here, toilet water from low-flush vacuum toilets and milled organic waste were digested separately. The blackwater product was stored and spread in growing oats, thereby replacing mineral fertilisers. Data on the wastewater system were derived from simulations by the substance-flow model URWARE/ORWARE. Assumed conditions for the agricultural system were mainly based on site-specific data from a farm producing according to the Svenskt Sigill label. All energy used and all emissions were related to a functional unit. The functional unit included wastewater treatment for 8830 persons in Surahammar, disposal of the sewage products and production of 2100 tonnes of oats on 486 hectares. As regards the operating phase of the whole system, the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system</b> required less fossil fuel and electricity than the other two systems. Although the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system</b> required considerably more fossil fuel for collection and transport, the total use of fossil fuel was lower due to a reduced need for mineral fertiliser. Construction of storage tanks and pipes for the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system</b> may, however, give a considerable contribution to the total environmental load. Including the construction phase too revealed that the use of fossil fuel increased considerably and was highest from the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system.</b> The emissions of greenhouse gases were of the same magnitude for all three systems, although slightly lower for the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system.</b> This was also evident when the construction phase was considered. The eutrophying emissions were reduced considerably in the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system</b> according to a maximum scenario, mainly due to reduced emissions of ammonium from the treatment plant. The emissions of SO 2 were of the same magnitude for all three systems studied, although slightly lower for the sludge utilisation system, As regards NH 3 and NOx, the emissions were highest for the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system.</b> A high substitution of mineral fertiliser, an optimal spreading technique and an appropriate design of the system for collecting and storing the blackwater were highlighted as important for many environmental aspects in the <b>blackwater</b> <b>system...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined An {{analysis}} of the environmental effects and resource consumption by four systems for management of wastewater and organic household waste in a new city area have been performed, as follows: (1) conventional system complemented with advanced sludge treatment for phosphorus recovery, (2) <b>blackwater</b> <b>system</b> with urine diversion and food waste disposers, (3) <b>blackwater</b> <b>system</b> with food waste disposers and reverse osmosis, and (4) local wastewater treatment plant with nutrient recovery by using reverse osmosis. Substance-flow analysis and energy/exergy calculations were performed by using the software tool URWARE/ORWARE. Emissions were calculated and classified based on the impact categories global warming potential, acidification, and eutrophication, according to ISO 14042 (2000). The analysis also included nutrient recovery (i. e., the potential to use nutrients as a fertilizer).

40|$|A {{paradigm}} shift to waste reuse has {{started in the}} wastewater sector with many experts calling for greater resource recovery, often facilitated by alternative solutions such as source separation. Source separation {{has been shown to}} be advantageous for improving treatment capacity, food security, and efficiency; yet these systems are still immature, considered risky by professionals and scarcely implemented. This study attempts to answer the question of why source separation is still marginalized by examining the Swedish experience with source separated wastewater from the perspective of Technology Innovation Systems (TIS) in order to identify obstacles and policy recommendations. Considering that source-separation is still in a development phase, the study found that source separation works moderately well within the on-site niche and that <b>blackwater</b> <b>systems</b> in general perform better than urine diversion. Knowledge development is found to be the weakest function. A major blocking mechanism is the weakness of interchange between knowledge development and entrepreneurial activity. Policy recommendations include: increased R & D; building networks and communication platforms; and establishing guidelines for technologies, legislation interpretation and organizational models...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{results from}} a 'census' {{of the status of}} on-site wastewater treatment systems (OWTS) management practices in the SEQ region as part of the Healthy Waterways initiative. The current number of on-site systems is estimated to be 127, 000 with septic systems accounting for 80 %. Key management issues were highlighted during the project, notably the frequency of greywater failure and inappropriate greywater discharge. Septic system failures were reported mainly in the newer combined septic systems that receive 100 % of household water compared with the split <b>blackwater</b> <b>systems</b> that receive about 20 %. Aerated systems were inadequately maintained. However, to date, no "smoking guns" of poor water quality from non-sewered catchments have been clearly identified. A clear outcome of this survey was the need for all SEQ Local Authorities to audit every on-site system. Predictions and assessment of catchment water quality risks from on-site systems would be greatly facilitated if data obtained from these audits could be used in catchment water quality modelling and risk assessment.

40|$|Monitoring the {{longitudinal}} rail movement or rail creep {{is regarded as}} one of the effective ways to understand the rail-stress states in critical locations such as fixed structures (level crossings,turnouts and fixed top bridges), in sags at the bottom of gradients or any track segment with a history of buckles. However, rail stress can be changed due to thermal and mechanical loads in both longitudinal and vertical directions. Many railway companies use a fixed schedule to assess rail creep, particularly in critical locations. This may not be adequate to reduce the risk of summerbuckling and winter pull-apart problems. Current practice of creep measurement does not consider the effect of rail temperature, the vertical movement of track, inherent inaccuracy of the measurement system and any non-uniformity in track structures. In a field test, Total Station Survey equipment has been used to monitor the changes inlongitudinal and vertical displacements of the rail at points on a tangent track section in the heavy haul <b>Blackwater</b> <b>system</b> of the QR National network at Edungalba. This 26 tonne axle load track section with 1 % gradient and 60 kg/m rail was instrumented with strain gauges, thermocouples and rail stress modules. The creep in this section has been quantified in terms of rail strain and rail stress with respect to the rail temperature. In this paper, a method is proposed considering {{the longitudinal}} creep data, vertical displacement of the rail and rail temperature to accurately predict the stress state of a tangent rail track...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{point to}} this Paper {{is the idea}} and wish to adapt the society and its {{different}} activities to a recycle society. A building area in Göteborg is planned and investigated for such adaptation. In the district named Skogaberg, about 130 households totally are planned from what 20 are blocks of flats. The idea with this project is to constitute an alternative sewage system, a <b>Blackwater</b> <b>system,</b> were the fractions of most nutrients and least pollution are separated, taken care of and utilised. The aim {{is to get a}} market and use the nutrients of the organic waste from the household in agriculture use. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) pays attention to water- and sewage systems from a recycle perspective and the aim of a long-termed sustainable development. The agriculture sector has also an intention to protect the environment and the means for sustainability. The object {{of this study is to}} map and analyse a planned alternative sewage system in Skogaberg from recommended criteria for water and sewage systems. The alternative solution in Skogaberg will be analysed compared to a conventional solution. A specific aim is to estimate the possibilities and limitations of the alternative system when it comes to recycle of nutrients. Phosphorus and cadmium are chosen to describe and indicate the resource utilisation and environmental impact of different nutrient sources. Sanitation and risks with diseases, environmental&resource saving criteria together with technical&socio-economic criteria are intended to constitute a general background for the analysis. Criteria recommended, to concern environmental adapted water and sewage system by the Swedish EPA, is used in order to make an assessment of the planned system and a more viewed assessment and analyse is done from experiences and observations that I have got from literature sources and place studies. The results show good theoretical possibilities to get and recycle nutrients from the system with an alternative solution. With an alternative sewage system in Skogaberg opportunities that the users reflect and care are created. This project may provide us with innovations and ground for further research and development in future project. But it is also important to consider that these projects are established in the system of the society and that these recycle systems are not directly comparable with ecological recycling system in nature...|$|E
40|$|Estuaries are {{intrinsically}} {{complex and}} dynamic ecosystems that display marked {{spatial and temporal}} variability. Because estuaries are situated at {{the receiving end of}} catchment activities, they are at particular risk of alterations to their natural complexity. The overarching objective {{of this study was to}} gain an overview of the abiotic conditions and biotic response of the Goukamma Estuary, a small temporarily open/closed estuary (TOCE) which is situated in a relatively undisturbed catchment in the Southern Cape. Physico-chemical properties drive estuarine ecology, and together with biological indicators, are commonly assessed to determine the present status of an estuary. During the study, physico-chemical parameters reflected great spatial and temporal variability in response to the mouth state over a 13 month period. Parameters ranged within expected limits, as proposed by the conceptual model for water quality of TOCE’s (Snow and Taljaard 2007). Of particular importance was the prominent occurrence of salinity stratification and hypoxic conditions (dissolved oxygen [DO] 6 mg l- 1) were maintained throughout the water column mainly by wind and tidal action. However, stratification increased towards the deeper, channel-like middle and upper reaches of the estuary, followed by a significant reduction in bottom DO concentrations and development of hypoxia and anoxia. Bottom water hypoxia commonly occurs in microtidal estuaries due to the limited influence of mixing forces, mainly by wind and tidal action. The Goukamma Estuary is a channel-like microtidal estuary where stratification effectively limited oxygenation of the bottom water which resulted in frequent occurrence of bottom water hypoxia. During June 2010 when the highest local rainfall (75 mm) was recorded for the region, salinity and DO data showed that this amount of rainfall was insignificant as it did not replenish the water column of oxygen. Only the surface 0. 5 m layer was fresh and oxygenated while below this, the water column was completely hypoxic. In an unimpacted state, the Goukamma Estuary is a <b>blackwater</b> <b>system</b> and is expected to be nutrient poor; however, farming activities in the catchment have resulted in elevated nutrient concentrations. This study showed that significantly higher nutrient concentrations were measured in the middle and upper reaches of the estuary, adjacent to cattle farms situated in the floodplain of these reaches. Nutrient concentrations represented mesotrophic (dissolved inorganic nitrogen [DIN] > 500 μg l- 1) to eutrophic conditions (dissolved inorganic phosphorus [DIP] > 25 μg l- 1). Nutrient input stimulated phytoplankton to attain a significantly high biomass, ranging between 0. 3 – 112 μg l- 1 (~ 7. 7 ± 1. 3 μg l- 1; n = 128) and 0. 8 – 289 μg l- 1 (~ 21. 1 ± 4. 4 μg l- 1; n = 80) during the open and closed states, respectively. High organic loads are associated with high oxygen demands which consequently result in hypoxia following decomposition. Exacerbated by natural salinity stratification which effectively limits oxygenation of the water column, unnaturally high nutrient concentrations and coinciding organic loads place the estuary at particular risk of degradation. This study captured key patterns and processes by quantifying salinity, oxygen and nutrient concentrations in addition to biological indicators (phytoplankton biomass and community composition). Considering possible budget constraints, it is recommended that monthly salinity and oxygen concentrations should be monitored as well as seasonal nutrient concentrations. It is also recommended that riparian buffer zones should be established in the middle and upper reaches of the estuary, as these vegetation buffers have been well documented to contribute to nutrient attenuation and improved water quality from agricultural run-off...|$|E
