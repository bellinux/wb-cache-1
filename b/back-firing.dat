50|$|The first {{prototype}} {{was developed}} in 65 days. Challenges that it faced were filtering out noise from the vehicle on which it is mounted (such as loud engines and static sounds from the radio), ignoring sounds {{similar to that of}} a gunshot (such as fireworks or a car <b>back-firing),</b> factoring in bullet ricochets, and ignoring outgoing fire from friendly troops. Small quantities of Boomerang were battle tested in Iraq and further improvements led to 2nd and 3rd generation versions called the Boomerang II and Boomerang III. In June 2008 a $73.8 million firm fixed price contract was awarded by the U.S. Army to BBN for 8,131 Boomerang Systems, spares and training services.|$|E
50|$|In a {{clash with}} a Shadowen, {{which happens to}} be Coll in disguise, Par Ohmsford finds out that the Sword really works and is truly the lost Sword of Shannara. During the fight, through the truth that is {{revealed}} by the Sword, Par discovers who he had really fought, and then follows Coll to help him. Together they go to Rainbow Lake and finally, {{with the help of the}} King of Silver River, Par saves his brother from Rimmer Dall, the leader of the Shadowen. However, due to <b>back-firing</b> of his own wishsong magic, he is left behind. Rimmer Dall imprisons Par Ohmsford at Southwatch and starts trying to break into his mind. At Paranor, Walker Boh fights the Four Horsemen, defeating all of them but losing his old friend Cogline in the fight with Death. Later, Walker dreams of Allanon, who asks him to help the Ohmsfords before they are lost. At Arborlon, Wren Ohmsford sets out to war against a Federation army. With the help of Triss and Tiger Ty, she manages to lead the Elves to a first victory, but then Creepers, who are responsible for the fall of the Dwarves, come to the aid of the Federation army.|$|E

50|$|Sitting at 1-1, the Bengals {{traveled}} to Washington {{to face the}} Redskins, with rookie quarterback Robert Griffin III (RG3) making his home debut. On the first play from scrimmage, Bengals' wide receiver and former college quarterback Mohamad Sanu launched a 73-yard touchdown to AJ Green to give Cincinnati an early touchdown advantage. Bengals third-year quarterback Andy Dalton started his day with a 0-yard interception touchdown by Rob Jackson that tied the game at seven, but soon went on an impressive tear {{the rest of the}} game. Dalton rebounded with a 48-yard touchdown to Armon Binns, part of 17 unanswered points by the Bengals that gave them a 24-7 lead late in the first half. Billy Cundiff would add a late field goal that made the score 24-10, Cincinnati, at half time. The Redskins made a run at the Bengals in the third quarter, scoring back-to-back touchdowns on a touchdown run by Alfred Morris and a two-yard pass from Griffin to Santana Moss, which tied the game at 24. However, on the first two fourth-quarter drives for Cincinnati, Dalton gave his team the lead <b>back—firing</b> two touchdowns, one to Jermaine Gresham from six yards away, the other to Andrew Hawkins who dashed and weaved his way for a 59-yard score that put Cincinnati once again up 14, 38-24. RGIII would scramble and dive his way into the end zone with three-and-a-half minutes remaining, but the Skins' comeback effort fell short as Griffin's hail mary was knocked away on the final play of regulation.|$|E
5000|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the First World War in August 1914, Graves enlisted almost immediately, taking a commission in the 3rd Battalion of the Royal Welch Fusiliers as a second lieutenant (on probation) on 12 August. He was confirmed in his rank on 10 March 1915, and received rapid promotion, being promoted to lieutenant on 5 May 1915 and to captain on 26 October. He published his first volume of poems, Over the Brazier, in 1916. He developed an early reputation as a war poet {{and was one of the}} first to write realistic poems about the experience of frontline conflict. In later years, he omitted his war poems from his collections, on the grounds that they were too obviously [...] "part of the war poetry boom." [...] At the Battle of the Somme, he was so badly wounded by a shell-fragment through the lung that he was expected to die and was officially reported as having died of wounds. He gradually recovered and, apart from a brief spell back in France, spent the remainder of the war in England.One of Graves's friends at this time was the poet Siegfried Sassoon, a fellow officer in his regiment. In 1917, Sassoon rebelled against the conduct of the war by making a public antiwar statement. Graves feared Sassoon could face a court martial and intervened with the military authorities, persuading them that Sassoon was suffering from shell shock and that they should treat him accordingly. As a result, Sassoon was sent to Craiglockhart, a military hospital in Edinburgh, where he was treated by Dr. W. H. R. Rivers and met fellow patient Wilfred Owen. Graves also suffered from shell shock, or neurasthenia as it was then called, but he was never hospitalised for it:I thought of going back to France, but realised the absurdity of the notion. Since 1916, the fear of gas obsessed me: any unusual smell, even a sudden strong smell of flowers in a garden, was enough to send me trembling. And I couldn't face the sound of heavy shelling now; the noise of a car <b>back-firing</b> would send me flat on my face, or running for cover.|$|E

40|$|A burner for {{firing of}} grain was {{investigated}} for function, safety and emissions. Fuel, ash, particulates, gas and condensed flue {{gas from the}} inner surface of the chimney were analysed, and the stainless steel chimney were analysed with SEM/EDX. Three security systems should give a high safety against <b>back-firing,</b> provided the sensors are correctly placed and in function. Frequent cleaning of the boiler/burner was needed and some sintering noted. Emissions of CO and OGC were low, but of par-ticulates, NOx, SO 2 and HCl higher compared with pellet. The condensed moisture was very sour and had high content of chlorine. After 800 cycles, the chimney was ruined by corrosion. Establishing of a list of near-accidents and fires in cooperation with insurance companies and an inventory and closer study of suitable materials for chimneys is recommended. If grain firing expands, techniques for re-duction of particulates, nitrogen oxides and acidifying substances should be developed...|$|E

50|$|Spark {{arrestor}} on the {{air intake}} (carburettor or electronic fuel injection) — a wire mesh screen on the spark arrestor cools any internal flame or spark created by <b>back-fire,</b> thereby preventing it from igniting fuel vapours inside the engine compartment.|$|R
50|$|A <b>back-fire</b> or {{backfire}} is combustion or {{an explosion}} {{produced by a}} running internal combustion engine that occurs in the air intake or exhaust system rather than inside the combustion chamber. Unburned fuel or hydrocarbons that are ignited in the exhaust system can produce loud sounds even if flames are not present at the tailpipe. A visible flame may momentarily shoot out of the exhaust pipe where the exhaust system is shortened. Fire may also travel into the air intake piping. Either condition may cause a loud popping noise, together with possible loss of power and forward motion. A <b>back-fire</b> is a separate phenomenon from the fire produced by Top Fuel dragsters.|$|R
40|$|Compliance {{is central}} to {{international}} law’s role in regulating the interactions of states. The rule of law requires compliance {{in order to be}} effective and makes compliance matter of international concern. State compliance {{is one of the most}} central questions in international law but despite the both practical and fundamental importance of the question, legal scholarship is still missing a satisfactory theory why and when states comply or do not comply with international law. International law like most laws is often obeyed but not enforced. It would be a fair assumption that parties’ interests are served by entering into the treaty and the existence of legally binding obligation translates into a presumption of compliance. However, the reasons for state compliance vary. Maybe surprisingly, the fear of official sanctions is rarely the reason for compliance. International law unlike domestic laws often lacks an official enforcement mechanism. This naturally creates a question, how binding is a law without enforcement? International health law has been viewed as ineffective in many senses of the word. In a legal sense when states failure to comply with their legal obligations and in a behavioral sense when states failure to change their own behavior as a result of a treaty, and also in a practical sense due to a treaty’s failure to accomplish its objectives. However the importance on human health shouldn’t need highlighting and in a global world public health is no longer just a domestic issue. If states choose to disobey their international health obligations, we are not talking about just a breach of agreement, but a health emergency that can affect millions of human lives. The International Health Regulations was renewed in 2005, but states are still showing reluctance to make global health governance less limited, more effective, and the World Health Organization is experiencing difficulties in enforcing the IHR in each contented area. Although the member states are legally bound to the IHR and the new IHR contains binding limits on the types of health measures states parties can take against public health risks, WHO still has no power to force states to comply with their IHR obligations. If WHO estimates that there is a poor cause to justify state’s actions, it can publicly comment state’s actions. The 2009 H 1 N 1 -pandemic was the first pandemic for forty years and the first true test for the revised Regulations, and the strengths and weaknesses of the Regulations are demonstrated in national responses to the 2009 pandemic. A major issue is whether effectiveness of the agreement depends upon enforcement mechanism and if an agreement can be effective without an enforcements mechanism, and if there is one, how will it work and is there a risk for <b>back-firing?</b> The new IHR is a binding treaty, but without an effective enforcement mechanism it is not a very strong one. Can a weak treaty have a strong future...|$|E
