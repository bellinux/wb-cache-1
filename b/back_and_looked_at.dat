25|$|GONZALES: Senator, I went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> my {{calendar}} {{for that}} week. I traveled to Mexico for {{the inauguration of}} the new president. We had National Meth Awareness Day. We were working on a very complicated issue relating to CFIUS.|$|E
60|$|Harold Quaritch {{took a step}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her in horrified astonishment.|$|E
60|$|Magdalen drew {{further and}} further <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him in rising alarm.|$|E

6000|$|The turnkey, {{who was a}} tall, {{powerful}} man, stepped <b>back,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Bill, {{pointed to}} the cell with his finger, as much as to say, [...] "Go in." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah poor fellow--he couldn't {{hold out}} to the end; {{he has had to}} come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> her once more. He knows she'll be sublime in these last scenes." ...|$|R
60|$|He stepped <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the doctor. The Frenchman's {{eyes were}} fixed upon the ground.|$|E
60|$|She put {{her head}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him sideways, {{laughing}} through the glitter of her hair.|$|E
60|$|I started <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him in amazement. For the moment, I was {{incapable}} of answering {{in any other way}} than that.|$|E
5000|$|They then stand a {{bit further}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the entire head. The judge {{is looking for}} {{proportion}} {{in the head and}} whether it 'matches' the rest of the body.|$|R
5000|$|Jones {{states that}} the boxer case {{is an example of}} how rapidly you can cause damage. Breeders need to stand <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the bigger problem. Why would anyone breed animals that suffer except for vanity? ...|$|R
5000|$|Barry claimed, in 1990, [...] "Living Eyes {{was just}} what was needed for us. We needed to stop being what we were. It was driving us all round the twist. We needed at that point to step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> our lives as individuals." ...|$|R
60|$|Foster {{went to the}} door, but as {{he reached}} it she called him <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him with a bitter, mocking smile.|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her hands}} behind her <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the dead man with her head a little on one side. [...] "Too kind," [...] she said very softly.|$|E
60|$|All of 'em hung <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> each other; {{they all}} seemed to think they'd 'ave a better chance when there wasn't so many numbers left in the bag.|$|E
6000|$|But {{this must}} end some time, perhaps it ended very soon, and only seemed long, as a minute's dream does. Stephen at last sat upright {{sideways}} in his chair, leaning {{one hand and}} arm over the <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Maggie. What should he say? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I keep on, {{stepping}} <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> it," [...] said Chatteris. [...] "Just lately I've scarcely {{done anything}} else. I'll admit it's a spacious and noble thing--political work done well--only-- I admire it, but it doesn't grip my imagination. That's where the trouble comes in." ...|$|R
2500|$|Brian Crawford, in an {{interview}} with KTBS-TV News said, [...] "That report is going to lend so much information to other fire departments across the country who may be operating the same way that Charleston was.

6000|$|... "Hoi!" [...] then {{burst from}} him with {{tremendous}} emphasis, {{after which he}} dropped his bundle, turned poor Rooney over on his <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his face {{with an expression of}} awe.|$|E
60|$|He stepped <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> it. It {{must be one}} of two things--either {{the hollow}} at the top was but a shallow cutting in a great block of stone, or the kist had a false bottom.|$|E
60|$|After Leduc had {{departed}} a silence fell between them, and endured some moments. His lordship was leaning forward, elbows on knees, {{his face in}} shadow. At length he sat <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> his companion across the little intervening space.|$|E
6000|$|But {{it seemed}} so odd to be walking about with such a man as that. But I want to go <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the black <b>and</b> yellow roses in that house, there. Would you go with me? that is, if we may. I wonder whether we may!' ...|$|R
40|$|This {{presentation}} {{reflects on}} the fact that the idea of determinism, or fatalism, keeps recurring, in very different contexts, at different times: logical fatalism, theological fatalism, physical determinism, etc. Standing <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> this big picture, it voices the suspicion that all these different determinist theses are manifestations of a single, deeper, conceptual trouble...|$|R
30|$|Today, {{we are in}} {{the middle}} of the {{deployment}} of wireless mesh infrastructures, and therefore also in the middle between initial hype and real numbers in terms of technical and economic feasibilities.

60|$|I {{told him}} what I had seen; told him in broken sentences, with gasps of pain between them, and very dexterously and swiftly he bound my arm meanwhile. He slung it from my shoulder, stood <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> me.|$|E
60|$|God {{knows what}} magic the name had for his ears; but Barnaby {{released}} his hold, fell <b>back,</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> him aghast. Suddenly he sprung towards him, {{put his arms}} about his neck, and pressed his head against his cheek.|$|E
60|$|She talked {{softly to}} herself a little while, then {{went over to}} the window and pulled on the string of the curtain till it rolled up. Then she went <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> her mother. She grew tired of waiting at last.|$|E
40|$|The Research Through Design (RTD) {{conferences}} represent important steps towards {{more meaningful}} academic practices, not {{only within the}} field of research through design but potentially for many related academic fields. In order to realize this potential, I would like to take a step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the RTD community {{in the context of a}} larger academic landscape...|$|R

To gain {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the nature of these spherical waves, let us go <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> the case when [...] In this case, there is no angular dependence and the amplitude depends only on the radial distance i.e[...] In this case, the wave equation reduces to ...|$|R
6000|$|Just {{when the}} man from Boston was {{beginning}} to tell me some more stories about first families, the Professor developed an unholy taste for hot springs, and bore me off to a place called Myanoshita to wash myself. [...] "We'll come <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> Yokohama later on, but we must go to this because it's so beautiful." ...|$|R
60|$|Martin came <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> the beady eyes, sneering, truculent, cowardly, {{and there}} leaped into his vision, as on a screen, the same eyes when their owner {{was making a}} sale in the store below--subservient eyes, smug, and oily, and flattering.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's right," [...] ses Mr. Goodman, and {{he pushed}} his 'at <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> Sam very serious. They walked on a bit further, and then Peter's uncle stopped sudden just as they was passing a large public-'ouse and looked at Sam.|$|E
6000|$|The elder man lay <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>looked</b> <b>at</b> {{him with}} half-closed eyes. [...] "By the way, Dorian," [...] he said, after a pause, [...] "'what does it profit a man if he gain {{the whole world}} and lose'--how does the {{quotation}} run?--'his own soul'?" ...|$|E
40|$|My work {{is mostly}} improvisational. When I step <b>back</b> <b>and</b> <b>look</b> <b>at</b> what I’ve made, it’s not {{until that moment}} that I know what the piece means. I am {{at a loss for}} words to express how I am {{impacted}} by each of my creations. Every individual will draw their own conclusions when they see my sculptures for the first time...|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of local government, ‘hard to reach’ is a term {{sometimes}} used to describe those sections of the community {{that are difficult to}} involve in public participation.

6000|$|... "We were {{surprised}} to {{find it in the}} possession of such men," [...] replied Harnett, with a laugh, [...] "and perhaps also a little surprised to learn that we could have put so much faith in any one of your assertions.
