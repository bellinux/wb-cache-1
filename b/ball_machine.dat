Howard Head, founder of the Head Ski Company, took tennis lessons following his retirement (his company was acquired by AMF in 1969). He used one of the tennis <b>ball</b> <b>machines</b> made by Prince, but was frustrated by his slow improvement in the game. Head joined the company in the early 1970s and developed the company's signature oversized tennis racket. Although the Prince Classic aluminum racket was the first oversized racquet to be patented, the Bentley Fortissimo preceded the patent by two years, causing Germany to invalidate it.|$|R

50|$|After retiring, Head {{decided to}} take tennis lessons and for this purpose he got himself a tennis <b>ball</b> <b>machine,</b> which was {{manufactured}} by Prince Manufacturing Inc. Although Howard was {{not very good at}} tennis, he figured out that the equipment for the game needed a lot of improvement or he was going to need a lot more practice. To begin with he became the majority shareholder and {{chairman of the board of}} Prince. While Head considerably improved the design of the <b>ball</b> <b>machine,</b> he still did not get any better at the game. He figured it out that it was because of the small sweet-spot of the tennis racquet. In order to make the game of tennis easier, Head came up with the design of oversized racquet. He filed and obtained a patent that covered tennis racquets with size 95-135 square inches. He also pioneered the development of the graphite racquet, which eventually became the industry standard, replacing wooden racquets.|$|E
