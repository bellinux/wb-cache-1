500|$|On May 11, around 1 a.m., Clemmons {{appeared}} {{naked in}} his living room and ordered two female relatives, ages 11 and 12, to fondle him. The two reportedly complied out of fear, and the 11-year-old fled the house afterward. Clemmons took the 12-year-old into his bedroom along with Clemmons' wife. Clemmons repeatedly referred to himself as Jesus, and said his wife was Eve. He released the 12-year-old girl after his wife begged him to let her go. However, around 4 a.m. that same morning, he gathered his family <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> and demanded they strip naked together. He later left the house, claiming the world {{was coming to an end}} and that he was [...] "going to fly to heaven". A family member called 911 and police found Clemmons at a nearby second house he was building, but Clemmons fled on foot and escaped. He failed to appear the next day for an arraignment on his May 9 charges. Child Protective Services investigated and substantiated the sexual abuse complaint. Latanya Clemmons, Clemmons's sister, told authorities he had undergone a change and was [...] "not in his right mind".|$|E
5000|$|Both {{adults in}} the home were overpowered, bound and gagged with duct tape. Linwood then {{assaulted}} Judy Barton in the kitchen, where she was raped within hearing distance of the others. Meekins continued the sexual assault, after which Linwood dragged Barton <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> briefly rummaged in the premises for valuables, and then left the house. The three remaining gang members covered their victims with sheets. James told Meekins, [...] "you've got to get one", upon which Meekins took a pistol and fatally shot Wilkerson in the head. James then shot Barton to death.|$|E
5000|$|At home, we {{find out}} the reason why Beavis and Butt-Head have not been going to school: they cannot find {{anything}} good to watch on TV. As they keep flipping through the channels and eating junk food, Beavis hears the phone ringing and Butt-Head tells him to make it stop. Beavis answers, and when Ms. Tress asks where the boys have been, Beavis says to her [...] "yeah, they're dead" [...] and hangs up, then goes <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room.</b> Meanwhile, Ms. Tress relays what Beavis told her to McVicker and Van Driessen. The two men have completely opposite reactions. Van Driessen, in disbelief that a student of his could have died, grieves while McVicker is overjoyed at the fact that, {{at least as far}} as he knows, he will never have to deal with Beavis or Butt-Head again.|$|E

50|$|The family hears Maddie's voice {{emanating from}} the television. Amy reaches at the television's screen while Maddie's static hand is seen to be {{touching}} Amy's hand {{on the other side}} of the screen. Amy and Griffin visit the Paranormal Research department for help. The staff sets up equipment in the house, and install GPS devices on everyone in the house. While trying to contact Maddie, Eric is ambushed in the closet by a ghost resembling her. Angered, he breaks down the closet wall, throwing a chair into the darkness inside the closet, and as the chair falls <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> of the house, it reveals a possible portal Maddie can escape through. The investigators realize that this haunting is a poltergeist. The lead investigator, Dr. Brooke Powell, decides to call occult specialist and television personality Carrigan Burke (revealed, much later, to be Powell's ex).|$|E
50|$|Jacob, {{rather than}} resting, is busy {{designing}} {{a model for}} a new neighborhood. At dinner, Andrea asks Rusty to go get the phone book from the living room, which usually only takes a minute or two. However, when Rusty (who was talking the whole time) gets <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room,</b> three hours have passed. Lisa lets Andrea have her room for the night and she sleeps {{on the couch in the}} living room. But the loud ticking from the clock keeps Lisa awake all night. Finally, near 3:00 am, she asks Andrea if she can sleep with her. Andrea says yes and tells Lisa to get her pillow from the living room. But when Lisa gets her pillow, the living room doors slam shut and lock. In Andrea's room, she hears the door open and something gets in bed with her. She finds the other side of the bed drenched in black slime. She turns the light on, but it's not there. Andrea goes downstairs and unlocks the living room doors, letting Lisa out. She suspects that Rusty may have locked them, but he tells her he went for a walk.|$|E

But that is nothing. Doubtless the day of my release was unknown. It was the hot season at Rome, and I wandered wearily about, seeing no familiar face, and unable to hear anything of our friends. I might have had patience and lingered, but {{it seemed to me that}} I had been patient so long--it was all exhausted. From there I went to Florence, with the same result. At last I came to London, and by making cautious inquiries through my bank, I discovered your address. So I have come here." ...|$|R
50|$|A {{nutrient}} cycle (or ecological recycling) is {{the movement and}} exchange of organic and inorganic matter <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> production of <b>living</b> matter. <b>The</b> process is regulated by food web pathways that decompose matter into mineral nutrients. Nutrient cycles occur within ecosystems. Ecosystems are interconnected systems where matter and energy flows and is exchanged as organisms feed, digest, and migrate about.

5000|$|The group soon {{decides to}} play [...] "Seven Minutes in Heaven" [...] and Chanel picks Chad {{and they are}} then seen in Chanel's closet making out, until she says that Chad must promise not to sleep with anyone else and pinky swear on it. Soon it's Chanel #5 and Roger's turn and they walk in. Chanel and Chad are walking <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> when they hear a scream. They {{go down to the}} {{basement}} and find Hester who discovered Sam's body and some of the sisters claim that Hester's the killer as she was the first to find her. In Chanel's closet, Chanel #5 and Roger, who probably didn't hear the scream, are making out until Roger starts talking about how happy he is to be separated from his brother, Dodger (Austin Rhodes), who died in the previous episode. While talking, suddenly he is shot three times with a nail gun and falls to the floor as the Red Devil continues to shoot him with the nail gun while Chanel #5 watches in horror. The killer continues to shoot and leaves soon after, leaving Chanel #5 screaming and crying. The group enter the closet and are shocked to see Roger dead, but soon claim Chanel #5 as the killer. Chad mentions him and his brothers fighting two Red Devils, letting everyone know there's two killers. Chanel claims Pete (Diego Boneta) as the killer as he hasn't been seen yet, Grace says he told her he's studying. Soon Chad finds a trap door under one of the Chanel's shelves. The group suggest that's how the killer got in and left after killing Roger. Chanel and Zayday go explore it, since they are co-presidents. Down in the tunnel, Chanel shows Zayday portraits of some of the past Kappa presidents and tells her a bit about them. When discussing where they'll be, the Red Devil appears with two axes and chases them, with both of them narrowly escaping after Chanel saves Zayday.|$|E
40|$|There {{is always}} some risk of {{incident}} {{associated with the}} combustion of solid fuels in automatically stoked boilers or stoves. These incidents are of essentially three types: smoke from the burner back into the boiler room (or <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>living</b> <b>room</b> from pellet stoves), gas explosions in the combustion chamber and back burning in the stoker. There can {{be a number of}} reasons for these problems, and in many cases such incidents have not been investigated. The Swedish Building Regulations stipulate that firing equipment shall have adequate safety against fire. They also recommend that stokers/burners should have at least two independent safety systems against back burning. The objective of this project has been to analyse such incidents and to test safety systems for pellet and wood chip burners, in order better to understand how they work. It has also included evaluation of the“fireguard” water sprinkler system. The results from the tests with pellet burners showed that the burners that were tested provided relatively good protection against back burning. However, it was found that it was very important how and where the systems (temperature limiter, water sprinkler etc.) were fitted on the burners in order to ensure correct and effective operation of the safety system. One of the key question was also where to position electronic equipment on the burners {{in order to ensure that}} it is not exposed to temperatures higher than those for which it is designed. Over the years, there have been major problems with back burning in older designs of wood chip burners using old technology. The chip burner used in this project was of modern type. The test with simulated back burning showed that the water sprinkler stopped the fire. However, for greater safety the water sprinklers should have included two separate water container. The test with the pellets stove showed that the temperature sensor was of crucial importance for safety against back burning in the stove. Back burn occurred in one of the tests, but only after all the stove’s safety systems had been rendered inoperable. The “Fireguard” water sprinkler system performed well in our tests. However, the position of the temperature sensors, and the integrity of their thermal contact, was of crucial importance for how quickly the sprinklers responded. Another water sprinkler (Syr) showed itself to be very slow to respond when its sensor were in poor thermal contact with the surface of the fuel feed chute. Experience from the tests in this project has shown that it is relatively difficult to simulate back burning in boilers and pellet stoves, despite setting up very favourable conditions for such back burning. Although modern burners and pellet stoves are equipped with all the safety systems that can be expected, several incidents still happen every year. This means that continued analysis of incidents and development of safety systems is essential. The results from this project will be included when SP’s P-marking rules for pellet burners, pellet stoves and chip wood burners are next reviewe...|$|E
50|$|Underfloor heating has a {{long history}} <b>back</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Neoglacial and Neolithic periods.
