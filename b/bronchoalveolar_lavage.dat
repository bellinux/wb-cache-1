500|$|An {{association}} of CASS4 with atopic asthma has been shown. CASS4 {{has also been}} reported to be an eosinophil-associated gene, with expression in sputum cells increased more than 1.5-fold after whole lung allergen challenge. Moreover, the CASS4 mRNA was upregulated in cells collected by <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavage</b> after segmental broncho-provocation with an allergen. Reciprocally, the CASS4 mRNA was downregulated when this procedure was performed following administration of mepolizumab (a humanized monoclonal anti-IL-5 antibodies which reduces excessive eosinophilia). [...] This suggests CASS4 activity may be associated with immune response in the context of atopic asthma development.|$|E
500|$|The {{diagnosis}} of DPB requires {{analysis of the}} lungs and bronchiolar tissues, which can require a lung biopsy, or the more preferred high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan of the lungs. The diagnostic criteria include severe inflammation in all layers of the respiratory bronchioles and lung tissue lesions that appear as nodules within the terminal and respiratory bronchioles in both lungs. The nodules in DPB appear as opaque lumps when viewed on X-rays of the lung, and can cause airway obstruction, which is evaluated by a pulmonary function test, or PFT. [...] Lung X-rays can also reveal dilation of the bronchiolar passages, another sign of DBP. HRCT scans often show blockages of some bronchiolar passages with mucus, which {{is referred to as}} the [...] "tree-in-bud" [...] pattern. [...] Hypoxemia, another sign of breathing difficulty, is revealed by measuring the oxygen and carbon dioxide content of the blood, using a blood test called arterial blood gas. Other findings observed with DPB include the proliferation of lymphocytes (white blood cells that fight infection), neutrophils, and foamy histiocytes (tissue macrophages) in the lung lining. Bacteria such as H.influenzae and P.aeruginosa are also detectable, with the latter becoming more prominent as the disease progresses. The white blood, bacterial and other cellular content of the blood can be measured by taking a complete blood count (CBC). Elevated levels of IgG and IgA (classes of immunoglobulins) may be seen, as well as the presence of rheumatoid factor (an indicator of autoimmunity). Hemagglutination, a clumping of red blood cells in response to the presence of antibodies in the blood, may also occur. Neutrophils, beta-defensins, leukotrienes, and chemokines can also be detected in <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavage</b> fluid injected then removed from the bronchiolar airways of individuals with DPB, for evaluation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavage</b> (BAL) is a {{procedure}} whereby a small {{volume of fluid}} is put into the airways in order sample the cells and fluids of the aveoli and epithelium of the bronchi. BAL may be performed using a BAL tube, which allows fluid {{to be added to}} and removed from the bronchi, or may be performed during endoscopy, if the endoscope has an irrigation channel. To perform BAL, the horse is usually sedated, and local anaesthetic is usually instilled into the airways to reduce coughing.|$|E
40|$|Extracorporeal photopheresis has {{anti-inflammatory}} properties. The {{development of}} pulmonary fibrosis includes inflammatory episodes. This study evaluates effects of extracorporeal photopheresis in experimental pulmonary fibrosis. The bleomycin model of pulmonary fibrosis was used. Two groups of 4 rats received intratracheal bleomycin to induce fibrosis. The treatment group received infusions of photochemically treated leukocytes harvested from syngeneic animals. All animals were sacrificed at day 21 after fibrosis induction and analyzed {{with respect to}} lung histology and hydroxyproline content, cellular composition of <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages,</b> serum and lavage concentrations of transforming growth factor-beta, interferon-gamma, and interleukin- 10, and expression of selected genes in the lung. Interleukin- 10 and transforming growth factor-beta protein concentrations increased in the plasma of treated animals, whereas the interferon-gamma protein concentration was higher in <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages.</b> Interferon-gamma gene expression was up-regulated in the lung tissue of treated animals. No significant differences between treated and untreated animals were found with respect to hydroxyproline, histology, and lavage cell count. To conclude, extracorporeal photopheresis has positive molecular effects but does not attenuate experimental lung fibrosis with respect to histology, hydroxyproline, and lavage cell count in the applied treatment regimen. Further investigations of extracorporeal photopheresis in experimental pulmonary fibrosis are justified...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of sex, age, number of <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages</b> and method of quantitation on the number of bronchoalveolar cells in rats. Forty Long Evans rats were divided into four age-sex subgroups of ten animals each. Nine consecutive <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages</b> were done in every rat and the number of <b>bronchoalveolar</b> cells/mL in <b>lavages</b> 1 - 3 (L 1), 4 - 6 (L 2) and 7 - 9 (L 3) were determined by hemocytometer and electronic cell counts (Coulter Counter). The sex or age of the rats did not show a significant effect (p > 0. 05) in the number of bronchoalveolar cells recovered from the lungs; however, {{there was a significant difference}} (p L 3). A discrepancy of. apprx. 8 % in the counts of bronchoalveolar cells was found between the hemocytometer and the Coulter Counter; however, these two methods of cell quantitation showed a significant (p 0. 05) differences were found in the percentage of fluid recovery (overall mean = 94. 5 %) among lavages L 1, L 2 and L 3. It was concluded that the electronic cell counting of bronchoalveolar cells is as reliable as manual counting. Although sex or age did not significantly affect the number of cells recovered from the lung, caution should be used in the number of lavages done per rat since this variable may significantly affect the results.

2500|$|Unless a horse has severe EIPH, {{with blood}} {{present at the}} {{nostrils}} (known as epistaxis), the main sign is usually poor athletic performance; other signs are generally subtle and not easy to detect. Frequent swallowing and coughing in the immediate post-exercise recovery period, and poor appetite post-performance may be suggestive of EIPH. A definitive diagnosis can only be made by endoscopic examination of the trachea. In the case where no blood is visible in the trachea, EIPH in the small airways may still be present and can be confirmed by a <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavage.</b> [...] Impaired arterial blood gas (oxygen) tensions during intense exercise, increased blood lactate, and rarely death have been noted (likely due to ruptured chordae tendinae or a different mechanism of lung hemorrhage). Epistaxis is diagnosed when blood is visible at either or both nostrils during or following exercise. [...] To confirm whether the blood {{is coming from the}} upper or lower airway requires further examination by endoscopy, although in some cases {{it is not possible to}} determine the location. [...] In the majority of epistaxis cases, the blood originates from the lung. [...] Epistaxis during or following exercise can less commonly occur as a result of upper airway hemorrhage, for example following head trauma, subepiglottic cysts, atrial fibrillation, or guttural pouch mycoses.|$|E
2500|$|Eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{is diagnosed}} {{in one of}} three circumstances: when a complete blood count reveals increased eosinophils and a chest x-ray or computed tomography (CT) identifies abnormalities in the lung, when a biopsy identifies increased eosinophils in lung tissue, or when increased eosinophils are found in fluid obtained by a bronchoscopy (<b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavage</b> [...] fluid). Association with medication or cancer is usually apparent after review of a person's medical history. Specific parasitic infections are diagnosed after examining a person's exposure to common parasites and performing laboratory tests to look for likely causes. If no underlying cause is found, a diagnosis of AEP or CEP is made based upon the following criteria. AEP is most likely with respiratory failure after an acute febrile illness of [...] usually less than one week, changes in multiple areas and fluid in the area surrounding the lungs on a chest x-ray, and greater than 25% eosinophils on a BAL. Other typical laboratory abnormalities include an elevated white blood cell count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and immunoglobulin G level. Pulmonary function testing usually reveals a restrictive process with reduced diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide. CEP is most likely when the symptoms have been present for more than a month. Laboratory tests typical of CEP include increased blood eosinophils, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate, iron deficiency anemia, and increased platelets. A chest x-ray can show abnormalities anywhere, but the most specific finding is increased shadow in the periphery of the lung, away from the heart.|$|E
2500|$|Test {{articles}} passing muster {{in vitro}} can be evaluated {{in a number}} of in vivo models (usually in mice) of ALI including chlorine inhalation, intratracheal instillation of bleomycin and in transforming growth factor β1 (TGF β1) overexpressing transgenic mice exposed to high dose doxycycline. Acute exposure to high concentrations of chlorine gas induces pathological and functional changes in the lungs of rodents. Histological changes consist of epithelial necrosis and detachment, increase in the area of smooth muscle, epithelial regeneration and mucous cell hyperplasia. Most of these abnormalities resolve with time. Functional changes (increased RL and/or bronchial responsiveness to inhaled methacholine) last for mean intervals of 3 and 7 days after exposure, but can persist up to 30 and 90 days, respectively. The functional changes are related to the overall abnormal airway epithelial damage and there is a significant correlation between RL and <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavage</b> ( [...] BAL) neutrophilia. Bleomycin is an antineoplastic antibiotic drug isolated in 1966 from the actinomycete Streptomyces verticillus. Bleomycin forms a complex with oxygen and metals such as Fe2+, leading to the production of oxygen radicals, DNA breaks, and ultimately cell death. Doxycycline driven overexpression of TGF β1 in the lungs of transgenic mice result in a time-dependent inflammatory response characterized by massive infiltration of F4/80+ monocytic/macrophage-like cells and a wave of apoptotic pulmonary cell death. Mice that survive this initial onslaught go on to demonstrate an increase in lung collagen content, and decreased lung compliance. A large animal model of ALI is the ovine model of body surface burn + heated smoke inhalation. It has been established that combined burn and smoke inhalation injury impairs hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction (HPV), the vasoconstrictive response to hypoxia, thereby mismatching ventilation with perfusion. Gas exchange is affected by increases in the dispersion of both alveolar ventilation and cardiac output because bronchial and vascular functions are altered by injury-related factors, such as the effects of inflammatory mediators on airway and vascular smooth muscle tone. As a rule of thumb, all these models are characterized by high mortality, inflammation of the airways and pulmonary parenchyma, edema and flooding of the alveolar spaces by a proteinaceous exudate, sloughing of the airway and pulmonary epithelium, scarring and transition to airway and pulmonary remodeling.|$|E

40|$|The {{pathophysiological}} and immunological {{characteristics of}} allergic immune responses {{are controlled by}} a variety of factors. We have studied {{the extent to which the}} route of sensitization influences allergen-specific IgE synthesis and local airway inflammation using a mouse model of allergic sensitization to the major birch pollen allergen Bet v 1. Sensitization of BALB/c mice with recombinant (r) Bet v 1 was performed using intraperitoneal (IP), subcutaneous (SC) or aerosol (AS) sensitization protocols. Mice were analysed for allergen-specific serum antibodies by ELISA and IgE-dependent basophil degranulation. Proliferative responses and cytokine production of splenocytes were measured upon Bet v 1 stimulation in vitro. <b>Bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages</b> were performed after airway challenge with aerosolized birch pollen extract for assessment of eosinophilic airway inflammation and local cytokine production in vivo. Highest allergen specific IgE levels and IgE-dependent basophil degranulation were achieved using the SC route. High IL- 5 production by spleen and lung cells was associated with pronounced eosinophilia in <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages.</b> After IP sensitization, despite giving the highest IgG levels, only low IgE levels, basophil degranulation and IL- 5 production were seen. On the other hand, AS sensitization, resulting in the lowest systemic IgE and IL- 5 levels, led to a comparably strong airway inflammation as the SC route. Our finding that the route of sensitization can result in a dissociation of local and systemic immune responses may contribute to a better understanding of the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and help to develop new treatment strategies...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{effector}} mechanisms of immune clearance {{in the lungs}} of rats immunized against mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa. After the gut-associated lymphoid tissue was primed and after a subsequent pulmonary challenge with live bacteria, significantly accelerated bacterial clearances from the lung and raised levels of anti-P. aeruginosa antibodies in sera (immunoglobulin G [IgG], IgA, and IgM) and <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages</b> (IgG and IgA) were observed for all immune animals. These changes were associated with enhanced recruitment, chemotaxis, chemokinesis, phagocytic indices, and chemiluminescence of pulmonary polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMN). In the alveolar spaces of immune animals, {{an increase in the}} level of PMN recruitment was not associated with higher levels of leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4). In contrast, in nonimmune animals that were intratracheally infected with P. aeruginosa, the levels of recruitment and activity of alveolar PMN were lower than those in immune rats but PMN infiltration correlated with {{a significant increase in the}} synthesis of LTB 4 in the alveolar space. In pulmonary tissue, LTB 4 synthesis for both groups was elevated. These findings suggest that accelerated clearance of mucoid P. aeruginosa from the lungs of intestinally immunized rats is due at least in part to factors that induce the enhancement of PMN recruitment and activity in the alveolar space. The mediators that regulate this enhanced response remain unknown but do not seem to include LTB 4. The high levels of LTB 4 measured in the <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages</b> and pulmonary tissues from nonimmune animals infected with live bacteria implicate LTB 4 as an important amplifier of the inflammatory response during acute pulmonary infections with mucoid P. aeruginosa in unimmunized hosts...|$|R

We grew a large amount of strain KNic by using Acanthamoeba castellanii, which enabled phenotypic, genetic and phylogenetic analyses that supported its affiliation as Protochlamydia naegleriophila. This new ameba-resistant intracellular bacteria might represent a new etiologic agent of pneumonia because it is likely also resistant to human alveolar macrophages (2, 3). Because other Parachlamydiaceae were associated with lung infection (4 – 6), we assessed the role of Pr. naegleriophila in pneumonia by developing a diagnostic PCR and applying it to <b>bronchoalveolar</b> <b>lavages.</b> The Study KNic growth in A. castellanii was assessed by immunofluorescence (7) with in-house mouse anti-KNic and Alexa 488 -coupled anti-immunoglobulin antibodies (Invitrogen, Eugene, OR, USA).
