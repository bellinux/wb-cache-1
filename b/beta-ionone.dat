40|$|Background <b>Beta-ionone</b> is an aroma {{compound}} {{found in}} the Rosaceae family. Some evidence supported that <b>beta-ionone</b> has a great potential for cancer prevention. To date, the anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects of <b>beta-ionone</b> in human leukemia cell line K 562 were not studied. Objectives Hence, we investigated whether <b>beta-ionone</b> could inhibit cell growth and induce apoptosis in the K 562 cells. Materials and Methods In this experimental study, human leukemia cell line K 562 was cultured and anti-proliferation effect of <b>beta-ionone</b> with different doses (25 - 400 µm) at different times (24 - 96 hours) on treated cells was evaluated by the MTT assay. To determine apoptosis rate, the Hoechst 33342 staining and flow cytometry was performed. Results The MTT assay showed that <b>beta-ionone</b> inhibited proliferation of K 562 cells in a dose-dependent manner significantly (P = 0. 0008). Moreover, the increased apoptotic rate was found after incubation of K 562 cells with 200 µm <b>beta-ionone.</b> The Hoechst staining and flow cytometry analysis indicated that <b>beta-ionone</b> could increase apoptosis of K 562 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Conclusions The results demonstrated that <b>beta-ionone</b> has anti-proliferative and apoptotic effects on K 562 cells, {{and in the future}} may be used in the treatment of some leukemia sub-types...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{we report}} on the {{synthesis}} and ability of the mesoporous material MCM- 41 to adsorb the norisoprenoid <b>beta-ionone.</b> This compound, with a violet aroma note, can be produced from lutein by the yeast Trichosporon asahii through a bioconversion process. We found that <b>beta-ionone</b> inhibited the yeast growth and constrained aroma formation. Growth inhibition was overcome using silicate MCM- 41 as sorbent device in a fermentation system that allowed product removal from the culture medium by headspace manipulation. Compared to a commercial silica gel, the mesoporous material exhibited a 4. 5 -fold higher <b>beta-ionone</b> adsorption. Contrasting to cultures without the sorbent device, the presence of MCM- 41 allowed a marked increase (14 -fold) in <b>beta-ionone</b> production. Our results suggested that confinement of the norisoprenoid into the sorbent material bypassed its toxicity which allowed a better <b>beta-ionone</b> production. This study represents the first report on the use of MCM- 41 to recover an aroma produced by fermentation and therefore, a novel application for a mesoporous material...|$|E
40|$|Olfactory receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. Some of {{them are}} {{expressed}} in tumor cells, such as the OR 51 E 2 receptor overexpressed in LNCaP prostate cancer cells. It is considered a prostate tumor marker. We previously demonstrated that this receptor is able to promote LNCaP cell invasiveness in vitro upon stimulation with its odorant agonist <b>beta-ionone,</b> leading to increased generation of metastases in vivo. In the present study, we show that even a relatively short exposure to <b>beta-ionone</b> is sufficient to promote metastasis emergence. Moreover, alpha-ionone, considered an OR 51 E 2 antagonist, in fact promotes prostate tumor growth in vivo. The combination of alpha-ionone with <b>beta-ionone</b> triggers a higher increase in the total tumor burden than each molecule alone. To support the in vivo results, we demonstrate in vitro that alpha-ionone is a real agonist of OR 51 E 2, mainly sustaining LNCaP cell growth, while <b>beta-ionone</b> mainly promotes cell invasiveness. So, while structurally close, alpha-ionone and <b>beta-ionone</b> appear to induce different cellular effects, both leading to increased tumor aggressiveness.

In this work, the biotransformation of beta-carotene into <b>beta-ionone</b> was investigated in systems containing variable proportions of decane to extract <b>beta-ionone</b> before degradation.

40|$|Background: Apocarotenoids, {{like the}} C 13 -norisoprenoids, are natural {{compounds}} {{that contribute to}} the flavor and/or aroma of flowers and foods. They are produced in aromatic plants-like raspberries and roses-by the enzymatic cleavage of carotenes. Due to their pleasant aroma and flavour, apocarotenoids have high commercial value for the cosmetic and food industry, but currently their production is mainly assured by chemical synthesis. In the present study, a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that synthesizes the apocarotenoid <b>beta-ionone</b> was constructed by combining integrative vectors and high copy number episomal vectors, in an engineered strain that accumulates FPP. Results: Integration of an extra copy of the geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthase gene (BTS 1), together with the carotenogenic genes crtYB and crtI from the ascomycete Xanthophyllomyces dendrorhous, resulted in carotenoid producing cells. The additional integration of the carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase gene from the plant Petunia hybrida (PhCCD 1) let to the production of low amounts of <b>beta-ionone</b> (0. 073 +/- 0. 01 mg/g DCW) and changed the color of the strain from orange to yellow. The expression of the crtYB gene from a high copy number plasmid in this former strain increased <b>beta-ionone</b> concentration fivefold (0. 34 +/- 0. 06 mg/g DCW). Additionally, the episomal expression of crtYB together with the PhCCD 1 gene in the same vector resulted in a final 8. 5 -fold increase of <b>beta-ionone</b> concentration (0. 63 +/- 0. 02 mg/g DCW). Batch fermentations with this strain resulted in a final specific concentration of 1 mg/g DCW at 50 h, which represents a 15 -fold increase. Conclusions: An efficient <b>beta-ionone</b> producing yeast platform was constructed by combining integrative and episomal constructs. By combined expression of the genes BTS 1, the carotenogenic crtYB, crtI genes and the plant PhCCD 1 gene-the highest <b>beta-ionone</b> concentration reported to date by a cell factory was achieved. This microbial cell factory represents a starting point for flavor production by a sustainable and efficient process that could replace current methods...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} suction {{electrode}} recording together with rapid steps into 0. 5 mM IBMX solution to investigate changes in guanylyl cyclase velocity produced by pigment bleaching in isolated cones of the salamander Ambystoma tigrinum. Both backgrounds and bleaches accelerate {{the time course of}} current increase during steps into IBMX. We interpret this {{as evidence that}} the velocity of the guanylyl cyclase is increased in background light or after bleaching. Our results indicate that cyclase velocity increases nearly linearly with increasing percent pigment bleached but nonlinearly (and may saturate) with increasing back-ground intensity. In cones (as previously demonstrated for rods), light-activated pigment and bleached pigment appear to have somewhat different effects on the transduction cascade. The effect of bleaching on cyclase rate is maintained for at least 15 - 20 min after the light is removed, much longer than is required after a bleach for circulating current and sensitivity to stabilize in an isolated cone. The effect on the cyclase rate can be completely reversed by treatment with liposomes containing 11 -cis retinal. The effects of bleaching can also be partially reversed by <b>beta-ionone,</b> an analogue of the chromophore 11 - cis-retinal which does not form a covalent attachment to opsin. Perfusion of a bleached cone with <b>beta-ionone</b> produces a rapid increase in circulating current and sensitivity, which rapidly reverses when the <b>beta-ionone</b> is removed. Perfusion with <b>beta-ionone</b> also causes a partial reversal of the bleach-induced acceleration of cyclase velocity. We conclude that bleaching produces an "equivalent background" excitation of the transduction cascade in cones, perhaps by a mechanism similar to that in rods...|$|E

The bimolecular collision rate was evaluated {{in terms of an}} experimental parameter W(x), defined as T 1 (- 1) (air,x) [...] T 1 (- 1) (N 2,x) where T 1 's are the spin-lattice relaxation times of the nitroxide in samples equilibrated with atmospheric air and nitrogen respectively, which is proportional to the product of local oxygen concentration and local diffusion coefficient (transport). W-values at the <b>beta-ionone</b> binding site in spin-labeled rhodopsin are in the range of 0. 02 - 0. 13 microseconds- 1, which are 10 - 60 times smaller than W's in water and 1. 1 - 20 times smaller than in model membranes in the gel phase, indicating that membrane proteins create significant permeation resistance to transport {{of molecular}} oxygen inside and across the membrane. W(thereby the oxygen diffusion-concentration product) is larger in the meta II-enriched sample than in rhodopsin, indicating light-induced conformational changes of opsin around the <b>beta-ionone</b> binding site. W decreases with increase of temperature for both rhodopsin and meta II-enriched samples, suggesting that temperature-induced conformational changes take place in both samples. These changes were not observable using conventional ESR spectroscopy. It is concluded that W is a sensitive monitor of conformational changes of proteins...|$|E

40|$|Olfactory receptors (ORs) are {{expressed}} in the olfactory epithelium, where they detect odorants, but also in other tissues with additional functions. Some ORs are even overexpressed in tumor cells. In this study, we identified ORs expressed in enterochromaffin tumor cells by RT-PCR, showing that single cells can co-express several ORs. Some of the receptors identified were already reported in other tumors, but they are orphan (without known ligand), {{as it is the}} case for most of the hundreds of human ORs.

This result allows us to rule out proton abstraction from the <b>beta-ionone</b> ring of retinal as a step in the catalytic cycle. Furthermore, phenyl retinal, a planar molecule, binds to the apomembrane more rapidly than retinal, which suggests that the rate-determining step in the binding of retinal itself may be the attainment of a planar molecular configuration.

40|$|Interactions between flavour {{compounds}} and beta-lactoglobulin (BLG) {{have been the}} subject of several studies, but there are no unanimous binding site explanations. In our laboratory, interactions between BLG, and two flavour compounds, <b>beta-ionone</b> and gamma-decalactone, were studied by 2 D-NMR spectroscopy. It appears that several amino acids affected by binding of gamma-decalactone are buried in the central cavity, whereas binding of <b>beta-ionone</b> affects amino acids located in a groove near the outer surface of the protein. 2 D/ 3 D-QSAR studies were performed using QSAR+ module of Cerius 2 and Catalyst. The QSAR equation provided by Cerius involves three molecular descriptors: AlogP 98 and two topological connectivity indices (CHI- 0 and CHI- 1). This model takes into account hydrophobicity and molecular shape more than molecular volume. A relatively flat (e. g. a circle) and elongated (non-branched) shape appears to be able to increase the affinity for BLG. In this way, affinity appears to be strongly related to London dispersive forces. It adequately satisfies internal and external validation and allows a signicant, but not an accurate, prediction of binding of aroma compounds to BLG. The commercially available software Catalyst focuses the modelling on the molecular behaviour of a ligand interacting with a receptor from the point of view of the receptor, but using only information from the ligand. In this way, it appears to be appropriate to identify binding sub-sites on BLG. The 3 D-QSAR models generation runs succeeded in providing signicant models which precisely estimated the affinities of sub-sets of compounds. A hydrogen bond acceptor and at least two hydrophobic features constitute the best models. Some model allows explaining the abnormal values of affinity constants of any compounds as -terpineol and highlights the importance of hydrogen bonding.

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of storage time at low {{temperature}} on volatile compounds in two cultivars of raspberry, Rubus idaeus L. cv. Sevillana and Maravilla, was determined. A total of 28 compounds were identified in both cultivars and showed quantitative differences between the cultivars.

We observed opposing trends in the volatile compound composition for the cultivars during storage at low temperature, in which 'Sevillana' lost compounds and 'Maravilla' was enriched. Therefore, storage at low temperature causes important changes in the volatile compound profile of raspberry, particularly the Sevillana cultivar, with significant decreases in C- 13 -norisoprenoids and increases in terpenes.

40|$|It {{has been}} found that {{beta-carotene}} cleavage products (CarCP), besides having mutagenic and toxic effects on mitochondria due to their prooxidative properties, also initiate spontaneous apoptosis of human neutrophils. Therefore, it was expected that antioxidants such as alpha-tocopherol would inhibit the stimulation of apoptosis and caspase- 3 activity by CarCP. However, we found that alpha-tocopherol increases caspase- 3 up-regulation and stimulation of apoptosis of human neutrophils by CarCP. Ascorbic acid does not alter this caspase- 3 up-regulating and proapoptotic effect exerted by alpha-tocopherol.

Uric acid alone or in combination with CarCP does not exert apparent effects on caspase- 3 activity and apoptosis. Up-regulating effect of alpha-tocopherol is not observed in the presence of retinol that markedly stimulates apoptosis by itself, whereas increase of caspase- 3 activity is induced by concomitant addition of alpha-tocopherol and <b>beta-ionone,</b> a cyclohexenyl degradation product of beta-carotene with shorter aliphatic chain...|$|E
40|$|The {{switch in}} the {{bacteriorhodopsin}} photocycle, which reorients access of the retinal Schiff base from the extracellular to the cytoplasmic side, was suggested {{to be an}} M 1 [...] M 2 reaction (Varo and Lanyi. 1991. Biochemistry. 30 : 5008 - 5015, 5016 - 5022). Thus, in this light-driven proton pump it is the interconversion of proposed M substates that gives direction to the transport. We find that in monomeric, although not purple membrane-lattice immobilized, D 115 N bacteriorhodopsin, the absorption maximum of M changes during the photocycle: in the time domain between its rise and decay it shifts 15 nm to the blue relative to the spectrum at earlier times. This large shift strongly supports the existence of two M substates. Since D 115 is located near the <b>beta-ionone</b> ring of the retinal, the result {{raises questions about the}} possible involvement of the retinal chain or protein residues as far away as 10 A from the Schiff base in the mechanism of the switching reaction...|$|E
