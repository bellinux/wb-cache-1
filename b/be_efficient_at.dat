5|$|Plants {{and animals}} {{living in the}} desert need special adaptations {{to survive in the}} harsh environment. Plants tend to be tough and wiry with small or no leaves, {{water-resistant}} cuticles and often spines to deter herbivory. Some annual plants germinate, bloom and die {{in the course of a}} few weeks after rainfall while other long-lived plants survive for years and have deep root systems able to tap underground moisture. Animals need to keep cool and find enough food and water to survive. Many are nocturnal and stay in the shade or underground during the heat of the day. They tend to <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> conserving water, extracting most of their needs from their food and concentrating their urine. Some animals remain in a state of dormancy for long periods, ready to become active again when the rare rains fall. They then reproduce rapidly while conditions are favorable before returning to dormancy.|$|E

50|$|Semantics {{does not}} always {{play a role in}} {{encoding}} specificity; memory, rather, depends upon the context at encoding and retrieval. Early research has shown that semantically related cues should be effective in retrieving a word provided the semantic cue was encoded along with the target word.

50|$|HENA: TOF is {{determined}} by a coincidence detection requirement {{that turns out to}} <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> eliminating photon background noise as well. An ENA passes through a thin film to a particle energy detector with its energy nearly completely preserved. At the same time, electrons forward scattered from the film are electrostatically deflected to a detector to create a start pulse. The ENA arriving at its solid state detector (SSD) creates the end pulse and its impact position yields its trajectory and therefore path length. The start and stop signals enable TOF to be determined.|$|E
50|$|Adeno-Associated Virus vectors can be {{used for}} stem cell gene therapy. Adenovirus' have a Baltimore {{classification}} of level I, meaning that they have a liner dsDNA genome within an icosahedral nucleocapsid. Some of their advantages as vectors are that they are considered to <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> gene delivery and can infect nondividing cells. A potential disadvantage is they are impermanent, must use the hosts replication system, and usually produce an immune response. Other disadvantages are that adeno-associated viruses are immunogenic, high toxicity and have a small packaging limit.|$|E

50|$|Various designs {{attempt to}} improve on the basic concept {{in any number of}} ways. One common change is to use two sets of holes, each {{designed}} specifically to <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> capturing or releasing the gas. In this case the forward set of holes is similar to the single-hole example, but a second rearward set of holes is added, using check valves (typically ball bearings in a pit) to allow the high-pressure gases in, but not out again. The system may be arranged to allow the gases to escape through the forward set of holes before the shell reaches it, causing a partial vacuum to develop directly behind the shell, aiding extraction.|$|E

5000|$|If {{a coffee}} filter doesn't possess enough strength, it will tear or rupture, {{allowing}} coffee grains to collect {{in the coffee}} pot. Compatibility describes a filter medium's resistance to degradation by heat and chemical attack; a filter that is not compatible with the liquid passing through {{it is likely to}} break down, losing strength (structural failure). Efficiency is the retention of particles in a target (size) category. The efficiency is dictated by the particles or substances to be removed. A large-mesh filter may <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> retaining large particles, but inefficient at retaining small particles. Capacity is the ability to [...] "hold" [...] previously removed particles, while allowing further flow. A very efficient filter may show poor capacity, causing increased resistance to flow or other problems as it plugging up prematurely and increasing resistance or flow problems. A balance between particle capture and flow requirements must be met while ensuring integrity.|$|E

Rat IgM and IgG 2 b <b>were</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> all stages from C 1 q binding to cell lysis. However, for other isotypes, a direct correlation between C 1 q binding and cell lysis did not apply. IgG 2 a, which <b>was</b> only modestly <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> C 1 q binding, was relatively more so for binding and activation of while C 1, and was by far the most effective isotype after IgG 2 b and IgM for C 4 and C 3 binding.

IgA <b>was</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> binding C 1, but again, this was not reflected in activation of later stages. The results suggest that properties of different isotypes, as well as influencing binding of C 1 q, may regulate attachment of the C 1 r 2 C 1 s 2 tetramer. In addition, distinct features of certain isotypes may favor C 4 activation and binding, independent of their ability to activate C 1...|$|R
50|$|One of {{the major}} sources for CALM's {{outgrowth}} was integrated definition (IDEF) modeling in aerospace manufacturing that was pioneered by the U.S. Air Force in the 1970s. IDEF is a methodology designed to model the end-to-end decisions, actions, and activities of an organization or system so that costs, performance, and cycle times can be optimized. IDEF methods have been adapted for wider use in automotive, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, and even software development industries. IDEF methods serve {{as a starting point}} to understand lean management through semantic data modeling. The IDEF process begins by mapping the as-is functions of an enterprise, creating a graphical model, or road map, that shows what controls each important function, who performs it, what resources are required for carrying it out, what it produces, how much it costs, and what relationships it has to other functions of the organization. IDEF simulations of the to-be enterprise have been found to <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> streamlining and modernizing both companies and governmental agencies.|$|E
5000|$|Diesel fuel is {{injected}} {{just before the}} power stroke. As a result, the fuel cannot burn completely unless it has a sufficient amount of oxygen. This can result in incomplete combustion and black smoke in the exhaust if more fuel {{is injected}} than there is air available for the combustion process. Modern engines with electronic fuel delivery can adjust the timing and amount of fuel delivered, and so operate with less waste of fuel. In a mechanical system fuel timing system, the injection and duration must be set to <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> the anticipated operating rpm and load, and so the settings are less than ideal when the engine is running at any other RPM. The electronic injection can [...] "sense" [...] engine revs, load, even boost and temperature, and continuously alter the timing to match the given situation. In the petrol engine, air and fuel are mixed for the entire compression stroke, ensuring complete mixing even at higher engine speeds.|$|E
50|$|The {{atypical}} structure, lack {{of target}} site modification, and sequence heterogeneity of Helitrons have made automated identification of Helitrons difficult. For genome-wide analysis {{there are two}} approaches that have been applied to find canonical Helitrons: De novo repeat identification approaches {{which can be used}} to build consensus libraries of all repeated sequences, but De novo repeat finding approaches will only identify Helitrons that are present in multiple relatively homogeneous copies in the genome. Therefore, the low copy and older Helitrons will tend to be fragmented and have poorly defined ends. These approaches are limited by the quality of the genome assembly and the homogeneity of the repeats. Another approach is structure based which relies on the structural features of canonical Helitrons and utilizes programs such as Helitronfinder, HelSearch, Helraizer, and HelitronScanner. As these programs are trained on known Helitron elements, they may not <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> identifying divergent families and they generate many false positives. This approach does not create consensus sequences of the candidate Helitrons, resulting in large data sets.|$|E

50|$|The {{problem with}} {{designing}} {{a new system}} is always the level of knowledge that is required from a system user {{to understand how to}} interact with an interface and, therefore gain increase in productivity of the task that the system is focused on. Many famous systems nowadays use alpha-beta-release scheme of testing the system on approachability to an end user, alpha is the first testing procedures that most software company use, it involves providing access to {{a small group of people}} with certain knowledge in order to test the most important features, then the system shifts to a beta phase where the access is gained to the public interested to test the features of the system and by giving access to a much bigger pool of testers system designers make sure that the system is tested under every possible condition for an every given feature, after the system is released to everyone else who is interested. However, since 20th century when the first basic systems were introduced many users had to study a lot about in order to <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> the interaction between operators and the system itself.|$|E
50|$|The {{context of}} {{learning}} shapes how information is encoded. For instance, Kanizsa in 1979 showed {{a picture that}} {{could be interpreted as}} either a white vase on a black background or 2 faces facing each other on a white background. The participants were primed to see the vase. Later they were shown the picture again but this time they were primed to see the black faces on the white background. Although this was the same picture as they had seen before, when asked if they had seen this picture before, they said no. The reason for this was that they had been primed to see the vase the first time the picture was presented, and it was therefore unrecognizable the second time as two faces. This demonstrates that the stimulus is understood within the context it is learned in as well the general rule that what really constitutes good learning are tests that test what has been learned {{in the same way that}} it was learned. Therefore, to truly <b>be</b> <b>efficient</b> <b>at</b> remembering information, one must consider the demands that future recall will place on this information and study in a way that will match those demands.|$|E
