25|$|The club's {{penultimate}} game of {{the season}} was against Siena, a game in which Parma needed three points to keep their faint hopes of European football alive and set a new club record for consecutive Serie A wins. The first half was tepid with neither side managing a shot on target, but opportunities were nonetheless to <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> both sides. The match continued in much the same manner in the second half until Sebastian Giovinco netted a spectacular volley from 25 metres out after 67 minutes. Parma got a second and sealed victory in injury time after Sergio Floccari took advantage of defensive sloppiness to roll the ball into an empty net.|$|E
25|$|They {{were very}} popular as Christmas gifts, however, {{and from the}} 1930s to the early 1960s, many bags were {{annually}} released to banks nationwide to be distributed as presents. In November 1962, during this annual distribution, {{it was discovered that}} there were some rare and valuable dates, still sealed in their original mint bags, all in uncirculated condition, among the millions of dollar coins still in the Treasury vaults. Collectors/investors/dealers lined up to purchase them in $1,000 bags, trading silver certificates for the coins. Before this event, the great rarity of the Morgan series was 1903-O, which was by far the most expensive of the entire set. It was discovered that there were millions of this specific date and mint in the Treasury vaults; an estimated 84% of the entire mintage sat in these bags, untouched for 60 years, all in uncirculated condition. While still relatively expensive in circulated grades, uncirculated examples can <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> a modest amount over common dates.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s AMT {{released}} brand new kits with new tooling {{for some of}} their old favorites, such as the 1955 Chevrolet Bel Air, 1966 Ford Fairlane GT, 1958 Edsel Pacer, 1960 Ford Starliner and 1957 Chrysler 300. These kits sold fairly well and can still be found on auction sites such as eBay at reasonable prices. The details in these kits far exceeded any from the 1960s. In the late 1990s AMT did something new in releasing pre-assembled and painted versions of these kits. These assembled models were sold as the Masterpiece Series and were nicely packaged in foam, similar to heavier diecast metal Franklin Mint or Danbury Mint models. Each had a Certificate of Authenticity enclosed. These models were beautifully finished and featured whitewall tires along with very detailed and authentically painted engines, suspensions and interiors, much more detailed than any promotional ever was, although these seem to be oriented to the adult collector and not the possible customer. Selections included a 1957 Chrysler 300C, 1960 Ford Starliner, 1962 Chevrolet Impala SS convertible, 1962 Pontiac Catalina SD421, 1966 Buick Riviera {{and a few others}} (Doty 2002b, p87). These ultra detailed models can still <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> less than $30.00 today on eBay and are one of the best bargains around. As assembled kits they were factory-glued together, but the glue used appears to be of high quality and when cared for properly they can be kept in good condition for years.|$|E

25|$|In 1866, Nelson Story {{traveled}} to Texas and spent $10,000 for 1000 (some accounts indicate possibly {{as many as}} 3000) head of Longhorn cattle. 1866 was {{the first year after}} the end of the American Civil War and the economy of Texas, as in the rest of the former Confederacy, was devastated. However there were significant numbers of cattle roaming Texas which could <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> very little money. Also, there was great demand for beef in the northern states along with money to pay for it. So many returning Confederate soldiers begged or borrowed a stake to get a herd together. Many others signed on as trail drive cowboys. Give or take, about 260,000 cattle were driven north from Texas that summer toward the nearest rail shipping point at Sedalia, Missouri in hopes of selling them there for a quick profit. To reach Sedalia, the cattle first had to be driven through the territory which was to become Oklahoma, but which at the time was the Indian Territory. This was the domain of the remnants of the Five Civilized Nations who had survived the Trail of Tears. While the tribes previously had tolerated the passage of a few herds, an exodus of this magnitude threatened their ability to support their own grazing cattle. Rather than blocking the herds entirely, they decided to charge 10 cents a head for passage. The drovers mostly paid the fee.|$|E

2500|$|According to Eugene Chavette, {{author of}} a {{restaurant}} guide in 1867, there were 812 restaurants in Paris, 1,664 cafés, 3,523 debits de vin, 257 crémeries, and 207 tables d'hôtes. [...] The latter were inexpensive eating places, often with a common table, where a meal could <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> 1.6 francs, {{with a bowl of}} soup, a choice of one of three main dishes, a dessert, bread, and a half-bottle of wine. [...] As the guidebook for foreign visitors noted, [...] "A few of these restaurants are truly good; many others are bad." [...] Ingredients were typically of poor quality. The soup was a thin broth of bouillon; as each spoonful of soup was taken from the pot, an equal amount of water was usually added, so the broth became thinner and thinner.|$|E

2500|$|Salmon's {{work with}} The Scientists in the 1980s {{influenced}} grunge music, which rose to prominence around Seattle, United States, before impacting on popular {{music in the}} early 1990s. The Scientists relied on unorthodox bass-heavy rhythms and distorted guitars, the latter being a direct precursor to grunge. The term grunge was used by Salmon in the mid-1980s to describe The Scientists' sound, which he recalled for the audience in an Australian Broadcasting Corporation documentary series on Australian music, Long Way to the Top, Episode 6: [...] "Gathering of the Tribes 1984-2000" [...] on 12 September 2001.

2500|$|In {{the early}} Seventies, {{two groups of}} enthusiasts: the Larkspur Canyon Gang, from Larkspur (long-time speed-riders down Mount Tamalpais), and later members of Velo-Club Tamalpais from Fairfax and San Anselmo in Marin County, California began group rides in the canyons and over ridges, {{up and down the}} fireroads around Mount Tamalpais, later racing bikes {{downhill}} in a race they called [...] "Repack" [...] because the ride was so grueling that riders had to repack their coaster brakes with grease after each run. The off-road terrain was rocky and the steep mountainside helped riders attain high speeds as they bounced and slammed over rocks and mud. Such harsh treatment caused regular road bikes to crumble, so the racers searched for a more durable and affordable alternative. They soon discovered that old balloon-tired [...] "clunkers" [...] (as they called them) could <b>be</b> <b>had</b> <b>for</b> $5.00 at a garage sale and would endure tremendous punishment. Soon, riders were snapping up these old cruisers, stripping off the heavy fenders and trim, and souped them up to improve downhill performance. Derailleur gears were added by Russ Mahon of [...] The Morrow Dirt Club in Cupertino at the 1974 Marin County cyclo-cross and Gary Fisher's 1975 used a tandem rear hub (from a flea market) with internal steel drum brake and threaded for a freewheel derailleur cluster to his old Schwinn Excelsior bike, enabling him to ride up the mountain, as well as down. About the same time, another rider named Joe Breeze began tinkering with his own Schwinn Excelsior, making it more suited to the [...] "Repack" [...] course. Soon, both of them began to build and sell custom mountain bikes to fellow enthusiasts, launching a worldwide cycling phenomenon.|$|E
