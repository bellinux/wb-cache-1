5|$|Duc had {{years of}} {{experience}} in France, which had given him a good feel of how the French might <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> and what their relations with Francophile members of the ARVN might resemble. He used this to concoct some plausible sounding and incriminating documents for Mậu. They purported to show that three prominent members of the junta: Generals Minh, Kim and Don had been bought by French agents and were on the brink of declaring South Vietnam's neutrality and signing a peace deal to end the war with the North. Some of the documents were leaked to elements of the American presence in Saigon and were {{brought to the attention of}} some senior American officials.|$|E
5|$|In 'Nothing Really Matters' and 'The Power of Good-Bye', I {{want people}} to have a visceral and {{emotional}} reaction to things, rather than to have in their mind where all my stuff comes from. With the songs, I {{wanted to say that}} it does not matter really what you think or do, just think by yourself, and not judge and dissect others. You know if I see a bug crawling across the floor and it inspired me to write the most incredible love poem, I don't {{want people to}} <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> about their relationship, and then think of my bug crawling across the floor. It's then that the power of good-bye becomes better than the power of acceptance.|$|E

The Oracle of Time is then revealed to be the living consciousness of Norma Cenva, somehow also still in existence millennia after the Jihad.|$|E
25|$|For a climactic finale, De Palma {{staged a}} chase from the {{platform}} of the Harlem-125th Street (Metro-North) Station to the escalators of Grand Central Terminal. For the shoot, trains were re-routed and timed so that Pacino and his pursuers could dart from car to hurtling car. The {{length of the}} escalator scene during the climactic shoot out at Grand Central Station caused a headache for editor Pankow. He had {{to piece together the}} sequences so that the audience would be so tied up in the action that they would not <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> about how long the escalator was running.|$|E
25|$|There is {{one major}} piece of {{evidence}} suggesting that abnormal connectivity occurs in autism. Autistic brains are known to develop very rapidly early in life, and this could cause problems {{in the development of}} cortical connections. It has been suggested that this early overdevelopment may be a cause for the impaired connectivity in autism. Diffusion tensor imaging studies of autistic brains are consistent with this idea, as they show reduced myelination (see:Myelin) in the areas of the brain that deal with social cognition and theory of mind, or one’s ability to comprehend what another person may <b>be</b> <b>thinking.</b> This provides further evidence for underconnectivity of the autistic brain.|$|E

25|$|Some {{consider}} that singing {{is not a}} natural process but is a skill that requires highly developed muscle reflexes, but others {{consider that}} some ways of singing {{can be considered as}} natural. Singing does not require much muscle strength but it does require a high degree of muscle coordination. Individuals can develop their voices further through the careful and systematic practice of both songs and vocal exercises. Voice teachers instruct their students to exercise their voices in an intelligent manner. Singers should <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> constantly about the kind of sound they are making and the kind of sensations they are feeling while they are singing.|$|E
25|$|After Hazumu's {{transformation}} into a girl, Asuta suddenly finds {{his good friend}} Hazumu very attractive, and cannot help himself when he starts thinking about Hazumu in a sexual way. During the time when Hazumu and her friends go to the beach, Asuta continuously tries to remind himself that even though Hazumu's body has changed, the person is still the same, and as her best friend, he should not <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> about her in a sexual way. Hazumu remains oblivious to the fact throughout the series that Asuta has been often thinking about her in a sexual way. Asuta continues to have fantasies about having Hazumu as a girlfriend as well. Overtime, Asuta realizes that Hazumu and him gradually grow apart from each other, or are at least not as close as they once had been when Hazumu was a boy. He does find it excellent that his friend is now a very attractive girl, but only wants to continue being Hazumu's friend and nothing more, constantly beating himself up for having impure thoughts about Hazumu. In the last pages of the manga, he announces to the others that he has found a girlfriend, and shows them a photograph of her. They remark that she {{looks a lot like}} Hazumu.|$|E
25|$|When {{writing the}} stories, {{he started with}} their twist endings, and then worked his way back from that. He {{designed}} {{the flow of the}} story by using a spreadsheet, and wrote prototypes of potential outcomes of the different scenarios in the game; after this, he matched it with the flowchart he had made, and came up with the details of each story. As he wrote each scene, he imagined what the player might <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> as they play through it, and decided what to write based on it; {{this was one of the}} most important things to him when writing. A key element to Uchikoshi when writing the outcomes of player decisions is that the importance of the decision usually is much greater after the player has made it, with the consequences only being revealed later on as the player learns more information; this was to maintain the high suspense level, and to avoid situations where choices end up not actually mattering. One big challenge for him was to maintain player interest through all branches; he tried to have each branch develop differently, as to avoid repetition and fatigue, and keep the player motivated. While he came up with the set-up, the setting, and the characters on his own, he had a sub-writer helping him with writing the second game, and two sub-writers for the third game. They would help with brainstorming ideas and finding what does not work so well and how to improve scenarios.|$|E

500|$|... "Breathe" [...] {{is about}} contemplation and holding back emotions. The lyrics {{were written by}} Minogue in Tokyo during her trips with her boyfriend, Stéphane Sednaoui, in late 1995. She {{explained}} the idea came to mind when her friends were worried about her being silent: [...] "My girlfriend told me 'You don't realize how loud you are when you are quiet'." [...] She {{felt that it was}} [...] "typical" [...] of her to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> and [...] "deciding what was wrong" [...] because she felt that things in her head [...] "were not clear." ...|$|E
500|$|Caldwell and Anderson {{deliberately}} did {{not meet}} before their reunion scene in [...] "Collision" [...] as they {{wanted it to be}} as authentic as possible. In the following episode, Hurley comments that he did not expect Rose's husband to be white, before Jack quickly changes the subject. The producers felt it was important to address that they are an interracial couple, and that Hurley was saying what the audience would <b>be</b> <b>thinking.</b> Caldwell agreed with them and thought it would be odd if the issue was not addressed. Anderson also was glad that Hurley brought up the issue, and liked that Jack did not pay any attention.|$|E

The story ends with Cowley telling himself, [...] " [...] 'I showed him...I guess I showed him. I guess I showed him I ain't so queer", a proclamation obviously laced with dramatic irony.|$|E

500|$|St Hill {{possessed a}} {{presence}} which compelled attention {{when he was}} batting. James wrote: [...] "Fires burned in St Hill and you could always see them glow." [...] When playing for Shannon, he insisted on the highest standards, {{and even though he}} was not captain, he would take over if the game was going against his team. James also wrote that he never understood St Hill as he did others: [...] "His eyes used to blaze when he was discussing a point with you; but even within his clipped sentences there were intervals when he seemed to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of other things, far removed." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{emotional}} McCaw {{could not}} hide his disappointment at the after-match press conference: [...] "If I knew the answers {{we would have}} sorted it out. We will <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> {{about it for a}} long time". McCaw denied New Zealand's easy run into the quarter-finals played a part in the loss [...] "A lot of the guys have been through this before, they've played big test matches." [...] Graham Henry's policy of using squad rotation and resting key players during the Super 14 was [...] criticised. McCaw also came under attack. He was accused of not inspiring his team, lacking the ability to change policy when plan A was not working and not providing enough leadership on the field.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to assembly of weapons, the AFSWP supported nuclear weapons testing. For Operation Sandstone in 1948, Groves ordered Dorland to fill every possible job with his men. He did this {{so well that}} Strauss, now an AEC commissioner, became disturbed {{at the number of}} AFSWP personnel who were participating, and feared that the Soviet Union might launch a sneak attack on Enewetak to wipe out the nation's ability to assemble nuclear weapons. The successful testing in Operation Sandstone was a major leap forward. The new Mark 4 nuclear bomb that the AEC began delivering in 1949 was a production design that was much easier to assemble and maintain, and enabled a bomb assembly team to be reduced to just 46 men. Kenneth D. Nichols, the wartime commander of the Manhattan District, now [...] "recommended that we should <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> in terms of thousands of weapons rather than hundreds." ...|$|E

500|$|Sapochnik {{was asked}} in an {{interview}} what the most difficult shot was to direct, responding [...] "The final sequence of seeing the armada {{on its way to}} Westeros was complicated because it involved so many different ships, and we only had one that we had to redress and shoot again and again. It was also raining and freezing when we shot it, and {{it was meant to be}} a Mediterranean climate. Emilia Clarke got so cold, her jaw started shaking uncontrollably and she totally lost her thread as far as what she was meant to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> in that moment, the cold will do that. She asked me to help, so I suggested that she just hum the theme to Game of Thrones in her head while we were rolling the cameras, and apparently that worked because it's the take we used in the final cut!" ...|$|E
500|$|In {{his last}} years, Bax {{maintained}} a contented retirement {{for much of}} the time. Walton commented, [...] "an important cricket match at Lord's would bring him hurrying up to town from his pub at Storrington with much greater excitement than a performance of one of his works". In 1950, after hearing his Third Symphony played at Bournemouth, he said, [...] "I ought perhaps to <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> of an eighth", but by this time he had begun to drink quite heavily, which aged him rapidly and impaired his ability to concentrate on a large-scale composition. [...] He wrote in 1952, [...] "I doubt whether I shall write anything else… I have said all I have to say and it is of no use to repeat myself." [...] Celebrations were planned by the Hallé Orchestra and others to celebrate Bax's seventieth birthday in November 1953. The celebrations became memorials: while visiting Cork in October 1953 Bax died suddenly of heart failure. He was interred in St. Finbarr's Cemetery, Cork.|$|E

[...] West offers a verse that [...] "starts off humble, {{but by the end}} he's bragging about his power and slamming his critics" [...] over a [...] "weirdly magnetic synthetic beat and dots of pretty piano clusters crafted by producer Sak Pace of the [...]" [...] Popdust reported that [...] "this is Jay at his most vulnerable, revealing things he may <b>be</b> <b>thinking</b> but not regularly willing to share with others. While the song's chorus seems to honor all of those [...] "Made In America," [...] the track is really a look at the history these two have shared and perhaps their differing futures." ...|$|E
