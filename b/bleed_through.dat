500|$|Bleeding Through {{was formed}} in 1999 in Woodlake, California. The band's roots {{can be traced back}} to 1998, when Breakneck was founded by Brandan [...] "Ohrly" [...] Schieppati (Eighteen Visions / Throwdown), Javier Van Huss (Eighteen Visions / The Mistake / Enewetak), guitarist Scott Danough, bass guitarist Chad Tafolla and drummer Troy Born (Taken). They made their live debut as the {{supporting}} act to Throwdown and Adamantium. As the band witnessed lineup changes, the departure of Van Huss and subsequent recruitment of Marc Jackson (Throwdown / Cold War) to cover bass whilst Tafolla reverted to guitar, they decided to expand their current hardcore sound and added elements of death metal to their music. The origin of the band's name was explained in an interview as follows: [...] "Well, it is summed up by the explanation that whether black, white, red, brown, yellow, religious preference, straight or gay, we all bleed the same, and we <b>bleed</b> <b>through</b> this life the same. Thus Bleeding Through." ...|$|E

50|$|To {{ensure the}} filter bags {{have a long}} usage life they are {{commonly}} coated with a filter enhancer (pre-coat). The use of chemically inert limestone (calcium carbonate) is most common as it maximises efficiency of dust collection (including fly ash) via formation {{of what is called}} a dustcake or coating {{on the surface of the}} filter media. This not only traps fine particulates but also provides protection for the bag itself from moisture, and oily or sticky particulates which can bind the filter media. Without a pre-coat the filter bag allows fine particulates to <b>bleed</b> <b>through</b> the bag filter system, especially during start-up, as the bag can only do part of the filtration leaving the finer parts to the filter enhancer dustcake.|$|E

50|$|Game 1 {{was played}} on May 6 at the US Airways Center in {{downtown}} Phoenix. The Spurs won 111-106. Late in the 4th quarter, Steve Nash collided {{head to head}} with Tony Parker, who had possession of the ball. Nash sustained a deep cut on his nose that bled profusely {{for the remainder of the}} game. His nose was bandaged and tended to by the team trainer, but Nash was in and out of the game as the wound continued to <b>bleed</b> <b>through</b> the bandages. It was the first time this postseason that Nash did not record a double-double. Tim Duncan and Tony Parker led the Spurs with 32 and 33 points, respectively. Nash led the Suns with 31 points, while Amar'e Stoudemire scored 20 and pulled down 18 boards.|$|E
50|$|SmFRET is {{also shown}} to utilize a three-color system better than {{ensemble}} FRET. Using two acceptor fluorophores rather than one, FRET can observe multiple sites for correlated movements and spatial changes in any complex molecule. This {{is shown in}} the research on the Holliday Junction. SmFRET with the three-color system offers insights on synchronized movements of junction’s three helical sites and near non-existence of its parallel states. Ensemble FRET can use three-color system as well. However, any obvious advantages are outweighed by three-color system’s requirements which includes a clear separation of fluorophore signals. For a clear distinction of signal, FRET overlaps must be small but that also weakens FRET strength. SmFRET corrects its overlap limitations by using band-pass filters and dichroic mirrors which further the signal between two fluorescence acceptors and solve for any <b>bleed</b> <b>through</b> effects.|$|E

Daily pages display the current moon phase, the day/week of the year, and short quotations {{from a variety of}} sources. The planner may be used in an optional cover with several useful features like card pockets, bookmarks, and a pen holder which doubles as a clasp. Covers are offered in a variety of materials and are sold in a different set of designs every year. The planner and covers are available in two sizes, the A6 'Original', and the larger A5 'Cousin'.|$|E
5000|$|He {{returned}} to London from Africa on 29 January 2000. He {{was admitted to}} University College Hospital, London, on 30 January 2000. He was transferred to Middlesex Hospital on 5 February 2000 and died there on 7 March 2000. An inquest was held on 10 May 2000 at Westminster Coroner's Court to inquire into rumours about {{the cause of his}} death. The coroner concluded that his death was due to [...] "Multi-organ failure due to upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage due to a duodenal diverticulum and arterial <b>bleed</b> <b>through</b> a mucosal ulcer". Following reports attributing his death to complications arising from malaria, the BBC Editorial Complaints Unit's investigation established that he had contracted malaria during his final African expedition. However, the pathologist had suggested the possibility that the ulceration and consequent haemorrhage had resulted from a pill (which might have been taken because of malarial symptoms) lodging in the diverticulum; but, even if this suggestion were correct, the link between malaria and the observed causes of death would be entirely indirect.|$|E
5000|$|While {{talking about}} the origins of the song on the Song Exploder podcast, Martin Doherty and Iain Cook {{explained}} that the trio originally intended [...] "Clearest Blue" [...] to be a laid back song with just two chords, but because they're notoriously bad at sticking to their own rules, they ended up with something completely divergent from those principles. After coming up with the base sample, they bounced ideas around, with Martin adding [...] "nonsense vocals" [...] to establish the basic cadences of the song. Lauren Mayberry began writing the lyrics to replace these vocals, but found herself frequently concerned that her pessimism would <b>bleed</b> <b>through</b> into the lyrics of the song in parts intended to be hopeful and optimistic. The song is typically described as building and building until it ultimately explodes at its melodic climax, but Doherty described it as more of an analytical climax, and that the vocal approach is not intended to be [...] "super climactic, like punching the air" [...] and that it is better described as a [...] "moment of rest." ...|$|E
