50|$|What {{started as}} the perfect crime {{for a pair of}} {{employees}} at the private banking firm of Greene & Greene takes a turn for the worse. Charlie and Oliver Caruso work at Greene & Greene, a private bank that is so exclusive you need at least two million dollars just to be a client. The brothers are denied a promotion. As one opportunity closes, though, another reveals itself. A mysterious benefactor brings to their attention an abandoned <b>bank</b> <b>account.</b> <b>No</b> one knows of the account's existence, it doesn't belong to anyone, and it contains three million dollars. IT is the brothers' for the taking. The brothers see the abandoned account as their way into a new life, debt-free. As soon as they take the money though, things take a turn for the worse. A friend of theirs dies, and then the eyes of the Secret Service, their bank, and a female private investigator turn on them. The brothers must scramble to find out who is pulling the invisible strings of that account, how they will prove their innocence, and {{what they need to do}} escape the Secret Service. In the process, their trust and relationship is tested.|$|E
40|$|Kinema Club is an {{informal}} community of scholars, artists, and fans interested in Japanese moving image media {{established in the}} early 1990 s. A group that Initially formed for informally swapping Xeroxes of tables of content from Japanese film journals eventually established a newsgroup called KineJapan, which instantly grew to 50 names. KineJapan now has over 600 participants from {{every part of the}} world. From this description you might gather than Kinema Club is more an idea than a group. The idea is that Kinema Club provides a rubric within which anything is possible. No one owns it. Anyone can take it and do something creative with it. We have no dues (and no budget or <b>bank</b> <b>account).</b> <b>No</b> system of introductions. No office. It is amorphous, even anarchic, but it has definitely {{played an important role in}} networking all the scholars, programmers and fans interested in Japanese cinema. One of the most important activities has been our workshops and conferences. At the end of the 1990 s, the study of Japanese cinema was undergoing some interesting transformations. Most notably, it was becoming increasingly interdisciplinary. To confront these changes head-on, an intimate workshop was held at the University of Michigan in 1999. One thing became immediately evident: although there were many students and professors studying Japanese film and television, no one really knew each other. KineJapan already had over 200 members at that point, but few people had met face to face. So subsequent workshops and conferences were held in Hawai'i (2003), NYU (2004), McGill (2004), Tokyo (2005), NYU (2005), Yale (2006), Frankfurt (2007), Harvard (2009), Hawai'i (2010), Vienna (2011) and Yale (2012) ...|$|E

Expressing fear that Najib would wield influence to remove any member of UMNO [...] "for {{the sole purpose of}} avoiding liability" [...] the court was also being moved for an injunction to restrain UMNO, its Supreme Council, state liaison body, divisions and branches from removing the nominal plaintiff as a party member pending the determination of the suit.

500|$|Equitable tracing {{is based}} not on legal {{ownership}} but on the claimant's possession of an equitable interest. There are several advantages to equitable tracing; first, it can trace property now mixed with other property. In Boscawen v Bajwa, Millett justified this by saying that [...] "equity's power to charge a mixed fund with the repayment of trust moneys enables the claimant to follow the money, {{not because it is}} his, but because it is derived from a fund which is treated as if it were subject to a charge in his favour". A limitation is that where the property has been put into a <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> that <b>no</b> longer contains enough money to repay it, it cannot be traced.|$|R

Wodkins acted like the businessman Petr Fomin, representing Emomalii Rahmon, {{the president of}} Tajikistan, trying to buy art. Tajikistan is a poor and corrupt country and Rahmon has ruled for 19 years. Wodkins' question was whether this would affect art dealers' willingness to sell art to the President - being paid from off offshore <b>bank</b> <b>accounts,</b> leaving <b>no</b> trace of the buyer, and arranging for discrete delivery of the art, including pieces by Ai Wei Wei, via the free-port of Geneva.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a very simple}} one variable model, apparently not previously studied, of a <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> with <b>no</b> random elements yet which displays chaos.

The owner of the account {{is not required to}} make any additional deposits or withdrawals, nor is the rate of interest required to change for chaotic behaviour to be observed in the balance in the account. In the process of investigating this model we aim to introduce ideas from chaos theory to a wider audience. No previous knowledge of chaos theory or dynamical systems is assumed and all technical terms used from these areas are explained, these include: strange attractor, Lyapunov exponent, ergodicity, mixing, dense set, invariant set, measure zero, countable and uncountable infinities. The three defining properties of a chaotic system are presented and are shown to be possessed by the model...|$|R
