5|$|An elf (plural: elves) {{is a type}} of human-shaped supernatural {{being in}} Germanic mythology and folklore. In medieval Germanic-speaking cultures, elves seem {{generally}} to have been thought of as <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> magical powers and supernatural beauty, ambivalent towards everyday people and capable of either helping or hindering them. However, the details of these beliefs have varied considerably over time and space, and have flourished in both pre-Christian and Christian cultures.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{the brain}} {{featured}} {{in popular culture}} through phrenology, a pseudoscience that assigned personality attributes to {{different regions of the}} cortex. The cortex remains important in popular culture as covered in books and satire. The brain features in science fiction, with themes such as brain transplants and cyborgs (<b>beings</b> <b>with</b> features like partly artificial brains). The 1942 science fiction book (adapted three times for cinema) Donovan's Brain tells the tale of an isolated brain kept alive in vitro, gradually taken over by a malign intelligence.|$|E

The Eastern Cape region of South Africa has the impundulu, which can {{take the form of a}} large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the Betsileo people of Madagascar tell of the ramanga, an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail {{clippings}} of nobles.|$|E
5|$|First, Plantinga {{pointed out}} that God, though omnipotent, could not be {{expected}} to do literally anything. God could not, for example, create square circles, act contrary to his nature, or, more relevantly, create <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> free will that would never choose evil. Taking this latter point further, Plantinga argued that the moral value of human free will is a credible offsetting justification that God could have as a morally justified reason for permitting the existence of evil. Plantinga did not claim to have shown that the conclusion of the logical problem is wrong, nor did he assert that God's reason for allowing evil is, in fact, to preserve free will. Instead, his argument sought only to show that the logical problem of evil was unsound.|$|E
5|$|The Avataric Blood travels within {{families}} {{forming a}} dynasty. The first-born {{son of an}} Avatar receives a so-called mantle at birth that manifests him as an Avatar of a new generation; whether the new Avatar is Light or Dark is chance. Therefore, there is one Avatar to each House per generation. Giving birth to a new Avatar leaves the mother barren and insane. Before that time, she can give birth to an unlimited number of females from an Avatar. These {{children as well as}} their respective offspring are called Vectori, <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> Avataric Blood who are not themselves Avatara, and who thus become generationally further removed from an Avatar in the bloodline. While Vectori cannot become Avatara, as that mantle is only conveyed upon birth, they can still exhibit some minor powers and often show signs of insanity.|$|E

5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word elf tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish <b>beings,</b> <b>with</b> Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the elf, and reimported the English word elf into the German language.|$|E
5|$|Christian apologist and philosopher Alvin Plantinga, a {{supporter}} of intelligent design, has formalized and revised the improbability argument as the evolutionary argument against naturalism, which asserts that it is irrational to reject a supernatural, intelligent creator because the apparent probability of certain faculties evolving is so low. Specifically, Plantinga claims that evolution cannot account for the rise of reliable reasoning faculties. Plantinga argues that whereas a God {{would be expected to}} create <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> reliable reasoning faculties, evolution would be just as likely to lead to unreliable ones, meaning that if evolution is true, it is irrational to trust whatever reasoning one relies on to conclude that it is true. This novel epistemological argument has been criticized similarly to other probabilistic design arguments. It has also been argued that rationality, if conducive to survival, {{is more likely to be}} selected for than irrationality, making the natural development of reliable cognitive faculties more likely than unreliable ones.|$|E
5|$|Most mythological {{elements}} in Carnivàle relate to so-called Avatars (or Creatures of Light and Darkness), fictional human-like <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> supernatural powers who embody good and evil. In its first season Carnivàle does not reveal its characters as Avatars beyond insinuation, {{and makes the}} nature of suggested Avatars a central question. By the second season it is established that Ben is a Creature of Light and Brother Justin a Creature of Darkness. Other than through the characters, the show's good-and-evil theme manifests in the series' contemporary religion, the Christian military order Knights Templar, tarot divination, and in historical events like the Dustbowl and humankind's first nuclear test. Show creator Daniel Knauf {{did not respond to}} questions about the mythology but did provide hints about the mythological structure to online fandom both during and after the two-season run of Carnivàle. Nevertheless, many of the intended clues remained unnoticed by viewers. Knauf left fans a production summary of Carnivàles first season two years after cancellation. This so-called Pitch Document, originally written to give HBO and Knauf's co-writers an overview of the intended storyline, backed up and expanded upon the assumed mythological rules.|$|E

25|$|The {{whole world}} {{is said to be}} filled with living beings. In all the three parts, there is the {{existence}} of very small living beings called nigoda. Nigoda are of two types: nitya-nigoda and Itara-nigoda. Nitya-nigoda are those which will reborn as nigoda throughout eternity where as Itara-nigoda will be reborn as other beings too. The mobile region of universe (Trasandi) is one Rajju wide, one Rajju broad and fourteen Rajju high. Within this, there are animals and plants everywhere where as Human beings are restricted to 2.5 continents of middle world. The beings inhabiting lower world are called Naraki (Hellish beings). Deva (roughly demi-gods) live in whole of the top and middle world and top three realms of lower world. Living beings are divided in fourteen classes (Jivasthana) : 1. fine <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> one sense. 2. Crude <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> one sense. 3. <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> two sense. 4. <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> three sense. 5. <b>Beings</b> <b>with</b> four sense. 6. <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> five sense without mind. 7. <b>beings</b> <b>with</b> five sense with a mind. These can be under-developed or developed which makes it a total of fourteen. Human beings get any form of existence and are the only ones which can attain salvation.|$|E

500|$|In {{an attempt}} to resolve this problem, Plantinga {{differentiated}} between [...] "greatness" [...] and [...] "excellence". A being's excellence in a particular world depends only on its properties in that world; a being's greatness depends on its properties in all worlds. Therefore, the greatest possible being must have maximal excellence in every possible world. Plantinga then restated Malcolm's argument, using the concept of [...] "maximal greatness". He argued {{that it is possible}} for a <b>being</b> <b>with</b> maximal greatness to exist, so a <b>being</b> <b>with</b> maximal greatness exists in a possible world. If this is the case, then a <b>being</b> <b>with</b> maximal greatness exists in every world, and therefore in this world.|$|R
