5|$|Durant was undrafted in the 2005 NFL Draft, but {{signed a}} free agent {{contract}} with the Baltimore Ravens and attended their training camp. He was briefly on the team's practice squad, but was cut during the 2005 season <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> about his size.|$|E
5|$|Facilities {{include three}} bird hides, a seawatching platform, two nature trails, and a visitor centre. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> about climate change, a major project in 2010 and 2011 brought {{improvements}} to the banks around the freshwater lagoon and {{the conversion of the}} brackish lagoon to tidal saltmarsh, a more effective barrier to encroachment by the sea.|$|E

5|$|In 1989, the Campus Ministry Association, {{representing}} 17religious denominations, unanimously {{approved a}} resolution asking {{the university to}} change Bonfire <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> about safety, participant academic performance, humanitarian considerations, and the environment.

5|$|Motor {{vehicles}} were restricted {{at the end}} of the 19th century <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> for the health and safety of the island's residents and horses after local carriage drivers complained that automobiles startled their horses.

5|$|The Reading Half Marathon is held on {{the streets}} of Reading in March of each year, with 16,000 {{competitors}} from elite to fun runners.

5|$|Allen became Jamaica's sixth {{appointed}} governor-general (eighth overall, {{including two}} acting governors-general). He replaced Sir Kenneth O. Hall, who resigned for health reasons. Allen's appointment was controversial {{due to his}} strong ties to the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> {{that he would be}} unable to attend functions on Saturdays due to his faith's strict observation of the sabbath. Allen resigned from his leadership of the West Indies Union prior to becoming governor-general, however.|$|E
5|$|Another issue {{concerned}} {{the election of}} the president. Few agreed with Madison that the executive should be elected by the legislature. There was widespread concern with direct election, because information diffused so slowly in the late 18th century, and <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> that people would only vote for candidates from their state or region. A vocal minority wanted the national executive to be chosen by the governors of the states.|$|E
5|$|Classifications in {{the first}} half of the 20th century divided lemurs into three families: Daubentoniidae, Indriidae, and Lemuridae, with the latter {{including}} the current Cheirogaleidae and Lepilemuridae. <b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> that Lemuridae might not be monophyletic, the family was later split; in 1982 Tattersall separated the Cheirogaleidae for the dwarf lemurs, mouse lemurs and relatives, and the Lepilemuridae for the sportive lemurs and bamboo lemurs (including the greater bamboo lemur). This classification is still used, except that the bamboo lemurs were moved back to Lemuridae.|$|E

The {{decision to use}} a ship instead of self-deploying was made <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> over icing during the North Atlantic portion of the trip, lack of available KC-130s for mid-air refueling, and the Wasps availability.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer (2000), on {{the other}} hand, reacts against this {{commonly}} held view and comments {{that the vast majority}} of the runestones were raised in memory of people who are not reported to have died abroad. She argues that few men who went abroad were honoured with memorials and the reason is that the runestones were mainly raised <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> at home, such as inheritance issues. Such concerns would have arisen when a family knew that a relative would not return from abroad.|$|E
5|$|Along with cougars, timber wolves are {{the largest}} top predators {{that live in the}} forest and have no predators of their own except humans. Most of the area's native mammal species are present in the forest, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Plans for their reintroduction to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> similar to those with the wolf reintroduction as well as fears for human safety. The northern and high elevation areas of the forest contain habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canadian lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E

5|$|<b>Because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> of {{long-term}} adverse side effects such as calcification of arteries and kidney stones, the U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) both set Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs) for {{the combination of}} dietary and supplemental calcium. From the IOM, people ages 9-18 years {{are not supposed to}} exceed 3,000 mg/day; for ages 19-50 not to exceed 2,500 mg/day; for ages 51 and older, not to exceed 2,000 mg/day.

5|$|Benzodiazepines are {{generally}} viewed as {{safe and effective}} for short-term use, although cognitive impairment and paradoxical effects such as aggression or behavioral disinhibition occasionally occur. A minority of people can have paradoxical reactions such as worsened agitation or panic. Benzodiazepines are also associated with increased risk of suicide. Long-term use is controversial <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> about adverse psychological and physical effects, decreasing effectiveness, and physical dependence and withdrawal. As a result of adverse effects associated with the long-term use of benzodiazepines, withdrawal from benzodiazepines often leads to improved physical and mental health. The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} suffering from both short- and long-term adverse effects, and as a result, all benzodiazepines are listed in the Beers List of inappropriate medications for older adults.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to gain {{increased}} support from Polish nationalists and patriots, Napoleon termed the war the Second Polish War—the First Polish War had been the Bar Confederation uprising by Polish nobles against Russia in 1768. Polish patriots wanted the Russian part of Poland to be joined with the Duchy of Warsaw and an independent Poland created. This was rejected by Napoleon, who stated he had promised his ally Austria this would not happen. Napoleon refused to manumit the Russian serfs <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> this might provoke a reaction in his army's rear. The serfs later committed atrocities against French soldiers during France's retreat.|$|E

Apple released the iPad in Hong Kong, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore on July 23, 2010. Israel briefly prohibited importation of the iPad <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> that its Wi-Fi might interfere with other devices.

5|$|On 3 August the Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt {{instructed}} Ofcom and the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) {{to examine}} Global Radio's purchase of GMG, which gave Global over 50% of the UK radio market <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> the takeover {{may not be}} in the public interest. On 11 October, the OFT agreed to fast-track the investigation. Hunt's successor Maria Miller said the deal would not be investigated for media plurality. The OFT concluded that the merger could lead to a rise in local advertising costs because of the decrease in competitors, and forwarded the matter to the Competition Commission, which oversees business mergers and takeovers. On the same day the Competition Commission announced it would publish its findings into the takeover by 27 March 2013.|$|E
5|$|Roddenberry {{intended}} {{the show to}} have a progressive political agenda reflective of the emerging counter-culture of the youth movement, though he was not fully forthcoming to the networks about this. He wanted Star Trek to show humanity what it might develop into, if it would learn from {{the lessons of the}} past, most specifically by ending violence. An extreme example is the alien species, the Vulcans, who had a violent past but learned to control their emotions. Roddenberry also gave Star Trek an anti-war message and depicted the United Federation of Planets as an ideal, optimistic version of the United Nations. His efforts were opposed by the network <b>because</b> <b>of</b> <b>concerns</b> over marketability, e.g., they opposed Roddenberry's insistence that Enterprise have a racially diverse crew.|$|E
