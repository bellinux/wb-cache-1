50|$|In 1840 Antoine Sauvage, a {{follower}} of Aristide Cavaillé-Coll, undertook a full restoration.He installed a <b>Barker</b> <b>machine</b> and made changes that reflected the new romantic aesthetic.In 1917 the piping was melted, the mechanism destroyed and the cabinet seriously damaged.The cabinet was rebuilt during {{the restoration of the}} basilica.Haerpfer-Erman of Boulay-Moselle, was given the job of reconstructing the organ in 1961, and the new organ was inaugurated on 27-28 May 1967.It has four keyboards with 61 notes and a pedal with 32 notes.|$|R
50|$|As {{part of a}} total {{restoration}} of the church (1979 to 1985), the existing organ was obtained as a monument worthy instrument, {{but at the same}} the front panel time pushed back. The I and II Manual have been faithfully restored, originally located at the far end, III Manual (Swell) was then set down a level to the lower case. Also, the laterally placed pedal mechanism had to be recreated on two levels. The instrument again consisted of mechanical cone chests, equipped with the three manuals and modern <b>Barker</b> <b>machines.</b> 51 of the 66 registers are now wholly or partly of the original organ, 4 registers were reconstructed and 11 registers, mostly in the Swell, have been added.|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} is to {{summarize}} usage of tractors in timber extraction and major problems of mechanized&# 13; timber harvesting in Turkey. Timber harvesting in Turkey is still carried out by manual methods due to&# 13; economical, social and environmental constraints. Almost 80 % of harvesting activities are mechanized in many&# 13; developed countries while this value is only 5 % in Turkey. Overall ratio of mechanization is relatively low. &# 13; Approximately percentage of man power, animal power, machine power and skyline harvesting are 72, 15, 8 and&# 13; 5 %, respectively. Turkish General Directorate of Forestry's mechanical park total amount is 457 in 2004. &# 13; Mechanical park amount has been reduced to 19 tractors (4 x 4 and assembled shovel), 169 skidding winches,&# 13; 6 tractors with equipment of snow cleaner, 46 forklifts, 26 loaders, 32 skylines, 65 agricultural tractors, 88 trucks,&# 13; 4 agricultural tractors with shovel, 2 <b>barking</b> <b>machines</b> as of 2004. Approximate percentages of skidders, trucks,&# 13; 4 x 2 tractors, forklifts, skylines, loaders, 4 x 4 tractors and <b>barking</b> <b>machines</b> are 36. 9, 19. 3, 16. 4, 10, 7, 5. 7, 4. 2 and&# 13; 0. 5 % in 2004. 4 x 2 and 4 x 4 tractors total amount has been reached to 41. 7 % in 1982, but this percentage has been&# 13; reduced to 20. 6 % in 2004. Total machine park amount has been reduced 41. 4 % between years 1998 - 2004 in&# 13; Turkey. In spite of existence of substantial number of harvesters, the amount of modern harvesting processor in&# 13; Turkey is not sufficient. Different type and marked machine hasn't taken into consideration to improve&# 13; mechanization and a poor standardization in harvesting is another problem in Turkey...|$|R
5000|$|The genius behind [...] "Ajeeb" [...] were {{players such}} as Harry Nelson Pillsbury (1898-1904), Albert Beauregard Hodges, Constant Ferdinand Burille, Charles Moehle, and Charles Francis <b>Barker.</b> The <b>machine</b> also played checkers, {{matching}} against figures such as 1920s American champ, Sam Gonotsky, who would also direct the machine under the ownership of Hattie Elmore.|$|R

40|$|Michele Barker will trace a {{creative}} genealogy between early moving image {{devices such as}} the praxinoscope and contemporary digital installations. Arguing that such devices are relational movement <b>machines,</b> <b>Barker</b> will explore more preindivduated perception from which moving bodies and media arise.

3000|$|A {{pioneering}} large-scale {{study was}} conducted concerning the automatic classification of companion dog <b>barks,</b> using <b>machine</b> learning algorithms [92]. The goal {{of this study was}} to determine whether specific but speaker-independent (so-to-speak) acoustic features of barks were encoded in different [...] "barking situations". Previous studies have showed that humans have the ability to categorize various barks that they hear and to associate them with the appropriate emotional content [93]. They also showed that humans with different dog experience levels show similar trends in categorization of the possible inner state of the given barking dog. Another study showed that human perception of the motivational state of dogs is influenced by acoustic parameters in the barks [94]. In contrast, humans show only modest accuracy in discriminating between individual dogs by hearing their barks [95].|$|R
5000|$|Barkdust is {{typically}} {{sold by the}} unit, with one unit of barkdust being equal to 200 cubic feet (7.41 cubic yards, or 5.66 m3); such large quantities of barkdust are typically delivered by truck to a jobsite. Barkdust is often spread with a <b>bark</b> blower, a <b>machine</b> consisting of a supply of barkdust, a blower, and a long flexible tube which [...] "sprays" [...] the barkdust over the intended area. Use of a bark blower often results in a more consistent application of barkdust than spreading it by hand, {{as well as being}} much faster.|$|R
50|$|While {{returning}} his Snipe to {{an aircraft}} depot, he crossed enemy lines at 21,000 {{feet above the}} Forêt de Mormal. He attacked an enemy Rumpler two-seater which broke up, its crew escaping by parachute (the aircraft was of FAA 227, Observer Lt. Oskar Wattenburg killed). By his own admission, he was careless and was bounced by a formation of Fokker D.VIIs of Jagdgruppe 12, consisting of Jasta 24 and Jasta 44. In a descending battle against 15 or more enemy <b>machines,</b> <b>Barker</b> was wounded {{three times in the}} legs, then his left elbow was blown away, yet he managed to control his Snipe and shoot down or drive down three more enemy aircraft (two German pilot casualties were Vfw. Alfons Schymik of Jasta 24, killed, and Lt. Hinky of Jasta 44, wounded). The dogfight took place immediately above the lines of the Canadian Corps. Severely wounded and bleeding profusely, Barker force-landed inside Allied lines, his life being saved by the men of an RAF Kite Balloon Section who transported him to a field dressing station. The fuselage of his Snipe aircraft was recovered from the battlefield and is preserved at the Canadian War Museum, Ottawa, Ontario.|$|R
