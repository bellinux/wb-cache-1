40|$|We study local {{interchangeability}} {{of values}} in constraint networks {{based on a}} new approach where a single value {{in the domain of}} a variable can be treated as a combination of “subvalues”. We present an algorithm for <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>values</b> and combining identical fragments. Experimental results show that the transformed problems take less time to solve for all solutions and yield more compactly-representable, but equivalent, solution sets. We obtain new theoretical results on context dependent interchangeability and full interchangeability, and suggest some other applications...|$|R

30|$|The {{increasing}} digitisation (Industry 4.0) of {{the whole}} economy {{will lead to more}} intelligent (in terms of more IT-based) and more networked manufacturing in new emerging production ecosystems, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> traditional <b>value</b> chains. The same is true for the circular economy approach, which is pushed forward by policy makers and pioneer companies in the view of pressing challenges such as climate change, increasing pollution and shortening of ecological resources {{as well as by the}} younger generation with changing consumption patterns more conducive to sharing instead of possessing products.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an inductive theoretical framework that explains {{how and why}} vertical disintegration happens, showing that transaction costs are an incidental feature of industry evolution. I find that gains from intrafirm specialization set off a process of intraorganizational partitioning, which simplifies coordination along parts of the value chain. Likewise, latent gains from trade foster interfirm cospecialization, which leads to information standardization. Given standardized information and simplified coordination, new intermediate markets emerge, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> the <b>value</b> chain, allowing new types of vertically specialized firms {{to participate in an}} industry, and changing the industry’s competitive landscape. Industry evolution has long been a central con-cern to management scholars and managers alike.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} subsidies and levies on the behaviour of households on the Dutch housing market. Our primary interest lies in {{the effect on the}} tenure choice and on the levels of housing consumption for the whole population. The housing consumption level is not a priori defined. We chose a one-dimensional housing concept. Differences between market values may reflect differences in house characteristics, but may also stem from differences between markets. To find the ‘true’ levels of housing, we <b>break</b> <b>up</b> market <b>values</b> of houses into price and quantity, resulting in regional price indices for owner-occupied and rented houses separately. After correction for actual subsidies and levies (for the current tenure choice) and for imputed values (for the alternative choice), households face individually varying prices. We use a survey data set of about 60, 000 Dutch households. Behaviour is estimated using a utility maximising consumption model with equations for both tenure choice and the consumption levels for owning respectively renting a house. The relation between choice and quantity is taken into account. The resulting price and income effects are in line with standard theory. Higher income gives a tendency towards owning rather than renting. ...|$|R
40|$|Dry eye {{syndrome}} is a multifactorial disease of tears and ocular surface resulting in ocular discomfort, visual disturbances and {{damage to the}} ocular surface with tear film instability. Diagnosis is based on symptom based assessment, clinical examination and tests like Schirmer’s, tear film <b>break</b> <b>up</b> time and Rose bengal staining of ocular surface. Conjunctival impression cytology (CIC) is a non-invasive, easy to perform test {{which can be used}} with other tests to diagnose dry eye. The present study aimed at evaluating the usefulness of impression cytology in the diagnosis of dry eye syndromes and to correlate the results of impression cytology with their aetiology. Materials and Methods: 150 eyes which met the inclusion criteria were subjected to clinical examination and diagnostic tests after obtaining informed consent. CIC samples were obtained from temporal bulbar conjunctiva and stained with periodic acid Schiff, Hematoxylin and eosin. The epithelial cell morphology was graded according to Nelson. Results: The eyes showed normal, grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 scores of CIC in 26 (17. 33 %), 41 (27. 33 %), 55 (36. 67 %) and 28 (18. 67 %) respectively. Abnormal CIC increased with declining schirmer’s, tear <b>break</b> <b>up</b> time <b>values</b> less than 10 seconds and increasing Rose Bengal staining. Thyroid ophthalmopathy and keratoconjunctivitis sicca were associated with severe while xerophthalmia was associated with mild cytological changes. Conclusion: Diagnostic tests when used in combination are more effective than when used alone in dry eye. CIC, a noninvasive and simple test can be used with other tests for the diagnosis and monitoring treatment of dry eye...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rise}} of a {{ubiquitous}} provision of computing resources over the past years, cloud computing has been established as a prominent research topic. Many researchers, however, focus exclusively on the technical aspects of cloud computing, thereby neglecting the business opportunities and potentials cloud computing can offer. Enabled through this technology, new market players and business value networks arise and <b>break</b> <b>up</b> the traditional <b>value</b> chain of service provision. The focus of this paper lies on the business aspects of cloud computing. Besides elaborating on a comprehensive definition of cloud computing its main contribution is a conceptual compilation of cloud actors and their roles within a new cloud computing value network and a conceptual development of a generic value network of different actors in cloud computing. Extending the prevailing technical perspective of cloud computing, this paper shifts the focus from an exclusive technological perspective to a broader understanding of business opportunities and business value...|$|R

40|$|MUC 5 AC is {{the most}} {{abundant}} gel-forming mucin in the ocular system. However, the specific function is unknown. In the present study, a Muc 5 ac knockout (KO) mouse model was subject to various physiological measurements as compared to its wide-type (WT) control. Interestingly, when KO mice were compared to WT mice, the mean tear <b>break</b> <b>up</b> time (TBUT) <b>values</b> were significantly lower and corneal fluorescein staining scores were significantly higher. But the tear volume was not changed. Despite the lack of Muc 5 ac expression in the conjunctiva of KO mice, Muc 5 b expression was significantly increased in these mice. Corneal opacification, varying in location and severity, {{was found in a}} few KO mice but not in WT mice. The present results suggest {{a significant difference in the}} quality, but not the quantity, of tear fluid in the KO mice compared to WT mice. Dry eye disease is multifactorial and therefore further evaluation of the varying components of the tear film, lacrimal unit and corneal structure of these KO mice may help elucidate the role of mucins in dry eye disease. Because Muc 5 ac knockout mice have clinical features of dry eye, this mouse model will be extremely useful for further studies regarding the pathophysiology of the ocular surface in dry eye in humans...|$|R
