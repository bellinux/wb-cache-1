40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the approximation of the critical <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> for thin composite plates. A new method to improve the approximation of this critical factor is applied based on its behavior with respect to lamination parameters and loading conditions. This method allows accurate approximation of the critical <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> for non-orthotropic laminates under complex combined loadings (including shear loading). The influence of the stacking sequence and loading conditions is extensively studied as well as properties of the critical <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> behavior (e. g concavity over tensor D or out-of-plane lamination parameters). Moreover, the critical <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> is numerically shown to be piecewise linear for orthotropic laminates under combined loading whenever shear remains low and it is also shown to be piecewise continuous in the general case. Based on the numerically observed behavior, a new scheme for the approximation is applied that separates each buckling mode and builds linear, polynomial or rational regressions for each mode. Results of this approach and applications to structural optimization are presented. ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a probabilistic methodology for the buckling analysis of sandwich composite cylindrical shells. The sensitivity to experimentally-measured imperfections is probabilistically assessed {{in terms of}} a loading factor, named probabilistic <b>buckling</b> <b>factor.</b> This factor corresponds to a required level of probability that shell withstands compressive load, and allows for a first evaluation of the buckling response and the imperfection sensitivity of the shells. In particular, the imperfections considered in this study include geometric imperfections, thickness variation, ply misalignment and boundary imperfections. An application is reported taking into account the geometric imperfections and thickness variation measured on a scaled shell of the Dual Launch System (SYLDA) of Ariane 5 launcher. Because only a scaled shell was available and was measured, the probabilistic <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> here obtained cannot be considered as the lower bound factor for the buckling response of the cylindrical shells manufactured nominally-identical to the SYLDA shell, but nevertheless allows to illustrating the complete methodology...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} {{reinforced}} concrete shell structures. First, {{the historical development of}} those extraordinary and spectacular structures is shortly presented. Geometrical shapes, {{that have been}} used when designing reinforced shells are discussed next: some of the shapes can be relatively easily mathematically described, some have been obtained experimentally, and others can be only given by using computational surface geometry. Main phenomena that define behavior of reinforced concrete shells are described: membrane and bending states, unextensible deformations, buckling (snap through, bifurcation buckling) and imprefection sensitivity. Numerical procedures that should be used when analyzing and designing of reinforced shell structures are roughly presented. Finally, a reinforced concrete shell shape of hyperbolic paraboloid is analysed and designed. Snow and wind loads on the shell are defined by using Eurocodes and results of computational fluid dynamics analysis. The linear and geometrically nonlinear static and linear buckling analyses were performed. The real critical <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> has been estimated; it is 1, 19 for the design load, while the computed corresponding critical linear <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> was much higher, 8. 1. The necessary reinforcement was determined for the shell and for the foundation, which was the basis for the detailed reinforcement drawings...|$|E
40|$|This study {{concerns}} the axisymmetric buckling of radially loaded circular Mindlin plates with internal concentric ring supports. The {{edge of the}} plate is either simply supported or clamped. Based on the Rayleigh-Ritz energy approach, <b>buckling</b> <b>factors</b> are determined and tabulated for plates of various thickness to radius ratios and with either one or two internal concentric rigid ring supports at various radii. The {{results show that the}} <b>buckling</b> <b>factors</b> for circular plates with one concentric ring support decrease with increasing thickness-radius ratios due to the increasing shear deformation effect. The effect of shear deformation on the <b>buckling</b> <b>factors</b> for plates with two ring supports is more pronounced than for plates with one ring support. The <b>buckling</b> <b>factors</b> for simply supported circular plates approach those for clamped circular plates when one of the ring supports is located sufficiently close to the edge. The tabulated buckling results should be valuable to designers for some industrial applications. Moreover, accurate and simple buckling formulas are presented for plates without any internal ring support...|$|R

Secondly, an opposite-based multiobjective population-based incremental learning (OMPBIL) is proposed for comparison with the original multiobjective population-based incremental learning (MPBIL). Multiobjective design problems with single-grid and multigrid design variables are then posed and tackled by OMPBIL and MPBIL. The results show that using OMPBIL in combination with a multigrid design approach is the best design strategy. OMPBIL is superior to MPBIL since the former provides better population diversity.

40|$|For a non-circular {{cylinder}} {{the radius}} of curvature changes around the circumference. Therefore for constant stiffness non-circular cylinders, some specific locations in the circumference {{are more prone to}} buckle. The same problem exists for circular cylinders with non-uniform loading in the cross-section like a cylinder under bending. This explanation brings to the mind the idea of tailoring the material such that the material potential is used more efficiently and if possible all parts of the cylinder contribute in the buckling phenomenon. Since the changes in the {{radius of curvature}} and/or loading happens in the circumferential direction, tailoring the material properties in the circumferential direction is a logical pattern. By assigning a certain number of half-waves in the longitudinal direction, the buckling eigen-value problem is solved to find the buckling load and circumferential mode shapes. The inverse of buckling load is approximated using a homogeneous, conservative formulation to increase the computational efficiency during optimisation. This is a hybrid approximation expanded in terms of stiffness linearly and reciprocally.

Fieldwork investigating the No al Club de Golf social movement in Tepoztlán, Mexico, demonstrates that respondents made two separate decisions about the movement: one, a decision about which side (group) of the movement to join; and, two, a decision about participation in the movement. 	 Fundamentally, fieldwork highlights the important role pre-existing identities played in respondents’ decisions about which side of the movement to join. Computational models for the Identity Salience and Supra-Additive approaches to multiple identities are built to examine how these pre-existing identities influence group emergence given social pressure, ideologues (<b>Buckle</b> <b>Factor),</b> agent interaction, and different conceptions of identities. Model outcomes show that the dynamics of individual level decisions are different between the Identity Salience and Supra-Additive models. However, aggregate outcomes are the same between the models when the populations have little variation in identity and social pressure tolerance strengths. Results also show that allegiance to historical identities, social pressure tolerance levels, and the presence of ideologues (<b>Buckle</b> <b>Factor)</b> does influence agents’ group choice differently between the two identity approaches...|$|R

In {{the framework of}} the MS 2 L methodology, the design problem is split and solved into two steps.

Within the project, this paper discusses the development of a probability-based methodology developed at Politecnico di Milano. It is based on the combination of the Stress–Strength Interference Method and the Latin Hypercube Method with the aim to predict the bucking response of three sandwich composite cylindrical shells, assuming a loading condition of pure compression. The three shells are made of the same material, but have different stacking sequence and geometric dimensions. One of them presents three circular cut-outs. Different types of input imperfections, treated as random variables, are taken into account independently and in combination: variability in longitudinal Young's modulus, ply misalignment, geometric imperfections, and boundary imperfections. The methodology enables a first assessment of the structural reliability of the shells through the calculation of a probabilistic <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> for a specified level of probability.

A thorough understanding of local optima will enable the engineers to select the algorithm for optimization or to guide the optimization to ensure either global optima or near optimal solutions are achieved. Therefore, a comprehensive literature review has been conducted and several illustrative examples have been identified to help fully understand the cause and importance of local optima. The first application involved {{the design of the}} internal structure of a simplified wing spoiler. MSC. NASTRAN was used to optimize each discretized location of an additional rib {{with the aid of a}} Patran Command Language (PCL) algorithm. The objective function of minimum weight was approximated as a multimodal function in a 2 D smooth curve where the local and global optima were identified. The theory of continuous rectangular plates was used to explain the phenomena. The second problem considered buckling of a wing rib. A PCL code was written to obtain the rib buckling factors as the position of the center of a square cutout was varied within a constrained area. The rib linear <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> versus the centre position O(X, Y) of the square cutout was plotted in a 3 D surface contour plot. Load path theory and relevant plate buckling theories were used to explain the local and global maxima identified. The final example considered the maximization of the buckling load of a simply supported composite laminated plate under in-plane loading. A conventional Genetic Algorithm was used to examine the local and global optima of the critical buckling load factor. Many local and global optima were identified and explained and many near-optimal solutions were found in a single run. A significant understanding of local optima in aerospace structural design with the optimal utilization of available software and the appropriate selection of optimization algorithms has been achieved. Further work could either include implementing the proposed global optimization strategies or include implementing rapid methods for identifying multiple local optima...|$|E

Tüm değişikliklerin ortak yönü ise, tasarımı iyileştirmek ve güncel taleplere daha iyi cevap vermek adına yapılmış olmalarıdır. Strüktürün ve malzemenin doğasına uygun tasarım yapmak, maliyetler ve tasarım bütünlüğü açısından büyük önem taşımaktadır. Yapısal elemanların bir araya getirilerek optimum tasarımlı bir yapının inşa edilmesinde, tasarımın mümkün olduğunca doğaya uyumlu olması büyük avantaj yaratmaktadır.

Since {{the ancient}} times, doctrines of {{structural}} design and structural member design have changed frequently. These changes {{have in common}} in the aspect of their aim. All changes {{have been made in}} order to improve the design and to fulfill the recent requirements of the design trends. Designing harmoniously with the structure and with the nature of the structural material is crucial to get the integrality in the design. Compatibility of the design with the nature also enables to get an optimum design in the aspect of building costs. In the history of the structural design and the structural member design, mankind has always pursued to get more effective and more natural behaved structures. The first form of this pursuit can be claimed to be the arch concept. With the accumulation of the knowledge obtained from the arch designs, a more complex form, “dome structures” showed up in the scene. As the dome designs had been elaborated, structurally more efficient types of the domes were formed. Speaking of structurally more efficient dome forms, the geodesic dome types appeared. Geodesic forms and geodesic dome structures are formed with the inspiration of molecular forms of the materials, the atomic forms, honeycombs, crystal structures, etc. The modern types of the geodesic forms and especially geodesic domes have been derived from the early studies and works of Sir Buckminster Fuller in 1950 ’s. He has many patents and projections about geodesic forms and this visionary man’s contribution to this knowledge have been enlightening the related studies, even today. In this study, the idea of geodesic forms is explained. The frequency concept which determines the spherical features and the stability behavior of the dome structure is defined. Examples of well known geodesic dome structures in the world and related to this, examples of their joint connection types are given. This thesis is prepared to explain the geodesic dome concept, define the natural behavior of the geodesic structure, explain the method of forming a geodesic structure and make a comparison between two analysis outputs of alternative geodesic structural analysis models with same polyhedron frequencies, load definitions, load application approaches, geometry and with different connection types. In this study, two similar “ 12 V frequency” geodesic domes which have “ 50 m” in diameter and “ 15. 2 m” in height formed and modeled with the “Geodesica” software. The output file from the software was imported firstly to AutoCAD software and then to SAP 2000 analysis software. With this procedure, the geometry of the analysis models are obtained. In addition to this, manually modeling & normalizing the geodesic forms are explained using diverse frequency models. Forming the geometry is explained step by step. In the load definitions process, “snow, wind” loads are obtained from ASCE 7 - 10 (Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures). For determining the seismic loads, DBYBHY 2007 (Specification for structures to be built in disaster areas) is used. For temperature difference loads (self straining loads) an assumption is made. The load combinations are taken from the combination tables of ASCE 7 - 10 (Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures) and derived to bring in compliance with the analysis model. Applications of loads to points, areas and joints are monitored to clarify the procedure. All loads are applied to the joints of the analysis model except for the self straining forces (loads from temperature differences) In the analysis part; response spectrum analysis, modal analysis and buckling analysis are performed for both models. Regarding to the outputs of these analysis, the frame sections are optimized. As the sections are optimized, the results are collected {{to be used in the}} calculations. For the analysis model with hinged joints (M 2 - 2 and M 3 - 3 released), the calculations of stress checks are made with respect to AISC 360 - 10 (Specification for structural steel buildings) and allowable stress design (ASD) criteria. Frames are calculated in two stress conditions. Which are axial pressure and tensile. Modal frequencies and buckling behavior outputs are collected to be used in the results section. For the analysis model with fixed joints (with no moment releases), the calculations of stress checks are made with the stress check module of SAP 2000 analysis software. Besides, “all load related” and “structural characteristics” of the model is made with respect to ASCE 7 - 10 (Minimum design loads for buildings and other structures) and AISC 360 - 10 (Specification for structural steel buildings), stress check modules are compiled and the stress analysis & checks worked properly. After determining the stress values of the structural members for both analysis models, a sample hinged connection design is given in order to monitor the design criteria of AISC 360 - 10 (Specification for structural steel buildings) for joints and welds. After all process is completed, a clear result emerged. The geodesic dome with the hinged connection members work properly and distribute loads, forces and stresses between the structural members with a high performance. The seismic performance and structural stability is solid. However, with many hinges in the connections, the buckling analysis showed that the structure is slightly vulnerable to the buckling loads. In order to increase the <b>buckling</b> <b>factor</b> of the structure, greater cross sections for the frames are selected. The increased sections are located on the lower/bottom elevations of the structure. Due to this increase in the cross sections, the weight of steel structure also increased and the capacity/stress ratios declined which makes the system members work with a lower capacity ratio due to the specified loads. The geodesic dome with fixed connection members work properly and distribute loads, forces and stresses between the structural members with a high performance as well as the analysis model with the hinged jointed frames. The seismic performance and structural stability is solid. In the buckling analysis, great numbers for factor values are obtained. This system is compiled with frame sections with lower cross sections. Analysis model with fixed joints gives an output of total material weight significantly lower when compared to the analysis model with hinged joints. However, producing and mounting the fixed connections in a geodesic dome is a really big challenge. The production and erection processes of this type of structure should be performed with a really high precision in order to get a structural behavior as simulated in the analysis model.

40|$|NASA s Shell <b>Buckling</b> Knockdown <b>Factor</b> (SBKF) {{project has}} {{the goal of}} {{developing}} new analysis-based shell <b>buckling</b> design <b>factors</b> (knockdown factors) and design and analysis technologies for launch vehicle structures. Preliminary design studies indicate that implementation of these new knockdown factors can enable significant reductions in mass and mass-growth in these vehicles. However, in order to validate any new analysis-based design data or methods, a series of carefully designed and executed structural tests are required at both the subscale and full-scale levels. This paper describes the design and analysis of three different orthogrid-stiffeNed metallic cylindrical-shell test articles. Two of the test articles are 8 -ft-diameter, 6 -ft-long test articles, and one test article is a 27. 5 -ft-diameter, 20 -ft-long Space Shuttle External Tank-derived test article...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the plastic buckling of moderately thick annular plates under a uniform compressive stress state. The analysis is based on the incremental theory of plasticity which employs the Prandtl-Reuss equations and the plate material is assumed to obey the Ramberg-Osgood stress-strain relation. The effect of transverse shear deformation is taken into consideration by adopting the Mindlin plate theory. The governing differential equations for the plastic buckling problem are solved analytically and the plastic <b>buckling</b> stress <b>factors</b> for annular plates with the allowance of transverse shear deformation are presented for the first time. The influences of the boundary conditions, thickness to outer radius ratios, and inner to outer radius ratios on the <b>buckling</b> stress <b>factors</b> are also examined...|$|R

This study presents analytical solutions for the buckling and vibration of uniaxially/biaxially loaded orthotropic thin and thick rectangular plates with an internal line hinge. The plate is taken to be flat, rectangular, with edges aligned along the material principal directions. The rectangular plate is simply supported on two parallel edges and the remaining two edges may take any combination of support conditions. The line hinge is perpendicular to the two simply supported parallel edges. The Le?vy solution method and the state-space technique are employed in connection with the classical plate theory (CPT) and first order shear deformation theory (FSDT) to study the buckling and vibration of orthotropic thin and thick rectangular plates with an internal line hinge. Numerical results are presented for all the six possible sets of boundary conditions. Exact <b>buckling</b> <b>factors</b> are obtained for rectangular plates of different modulus ratios (orthotropy), and aspect ratios corresponding to various hinge locations, and edge support conditions. In particular, <b>buckling</b> <b>factors</b> are determined for plates with modulus ratios of 1, 3, 10 and 25 using the classical plate theory and first order shear deformation theory. Vibration frequencies are obtained for the first 10 modes of vibration using both the theories. Extensive results are tabulated and complemented with figures in order to provide a vivid picture of the influence of the internal line hinge on the buckling and vibration behavior of orthotropic rectangular plates...|$|R
40|$|National Aerospace Laboratories has {{undertaken}} {{the design and}} development of a Carbon Fiber Composite (CFC) wing for SARAS Production Standard Aircraft (PSA) replacing the existing metal wing in SARAS Prototype Aircraft (please see the figures below). The optimisation of the CFC layup was carried out for minimum weight design of the wing subject to structural design constraints on strength and stiffness. While the strength constraints were based on Yamada-Sun failure theory, those on stiffness were based on Panel <b>Buckling</b> <b>Factors</b> (PBF) on compressive skins and shear webs. The design optimisation was carried out using SOL 200 of MSC/NASTRAN where the PBF were enforced through deployment of DRESP 2 secondary response feature of the optimizer. The details of the design optimisation process, the results and their discussions are presented...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{concerns}} the elastic buckling of triangular plates under uniform compression. Different edge conditions involving free, simple support and clamped have been considered. Moreover, the plates may have internal line supports at prescribed locations. The buckling analysis {{is performed using}} the so-called pb- 2 Rayleigh-Ritz method where the Ritz function {{has been defined as}} the product of: firstly, a two-dimensional complete polynomial function; secondly, equations of the internal line supports and; thirdly, the equations of the three edges with each equation raised to power of either 0, 1 or 2 corresponding to a free, simply supported or clamped edge. <b>Buckling</b> <b>factors</b> are obtained for right-angled and isosceles triangular plates of various height-to-base ratios. These very comprehensive results should be of considerable value and practical significance in design applications...|$|R
40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of closed form polynomial equations for compression and shear buckling to assess the effect of Bending-Twisting coupling on infinitely long laminated plates with simply supported edges. The equations are used to generate contour maps, representing non-dimensional <b>buckling</b> <b>factors,</b> which are superimposed on the lamination parameter design spaces for laminates with standard ply orientations. The contour maps are applicable to two recently developed databases containing symmetric and non-symmetric laminates with either Bending-Twisting or Extension-Shearing Bending-Twisting coupling. The contour maps provide new insights into buckling performance improvements that are non-intuitive and facilitate comparison between hypothetical and practical designs. The databases are illustrated through point clouds of lamination parameter coordinates, which demonstrate the effect of applying common design heuristics, including ply angle, ply percentage and ply contiguity constraints...|$|R

The buckling solutions are presented as contour maps, representing non-dimensional <b>buckling</b> <b>factors,</b> which are superimposed on the lamination parameter design spaces for laminates with standard ply orientations. The applicability of the results extends beyond the current certification envelope, comprising symmetric laminate configurations.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{buckling}} behaviour of rectangular Mindlin plates having two parallel edges simply supported, one edge free {{and the remaining}} edge free, simply supported or clamped. The proper boundary conditions at free edges subjected to in-plane loads have been examined. The buckling analysis is performed by applying the concept of state space to the Levy-type solution method to obtain the closed-form critical loads from the governing differential equations. The results, where possible, are compared with existing solutions to verify {{the validity of the}} solution method. The differences between <b>buckling</b> <b>factors</b> obtained with the appropriate and inappropriate free edge conditions are reported. Several design charts representing the essential features of the critical load characteristics of rectangular plates with two opposite edges simply supported at least one free edge are obtained, The critical loads can be determined from the design charts without difficulty.
