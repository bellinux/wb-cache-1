It is {{necessary}} to point out both the merits and demerits of the <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> proposal. Therefore, {{the significance of the}} <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> proposal can be justly assessed. Subsequently, the 2 ̆ 7 Health Check 2 ̆ 7 of CAP reform which will be implemented by European Commission in 2008 / 09 is examined. The complementary reform to the Fischler reform of 2003 is going to be implemented. This should be mid-term review of the Fischler reform. The policy distance between the current CAP system and the <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> proposal will come to be more and more diminished. Although there is a room for the dispute as to whether the <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> is simply a logical evolution of incremental CAP reform or a radical reform (a crucial break) from the existing CAP, the conclusion here is that the <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> will without doubt {{become one of the most}} important policy alternatives...|$|R

40|$|This paper aims {{to explore}} the {{contents}} and features of the current <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> proposal {{and the relationship between}} the above mentioned proposal and the new decoupled payments under the Fischler reform of 2003. Following the Agenda 2000 reform of 1999, the Fischler reform of 2003 advanced the further decoupled support from agricultural production. Its main feature is called as the Single Payment Scheme. This scheme embraces cereals, oilseeds, protein crops, beef, sheep, dairy, olive oil, tobacco, cotton and sugar. It is the non-product-specific direct payments. As a result, the policy distance between the Fischler reform and the <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> proposal came to be considerably diminished. It seems unlikely that the new Single Payment Scheme would be the last step in CAP reform. Finally, this paper reflects the merits of the current <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> proposal and shows its prospect in the near future. If the current <b>bond</b> <b>scheme</b> proposal is adopted, it will fully eliminate the interference of decision making within farm and release the entrepreneurial potential of farmers...|$|R

This work deals with 2 -D micromechanical analysis of two component adobe masonry (i. e. composite system composed of adobe bricks and mortar joints), focusing {{on the influence of}} different bond configurations and loading schemes. Homogenization is applied by defining a periodic unit cell for each of the investigated <b>bond</b> <b>schemes</b> and by deriving global failure curves, based on failure criteria of both mortar and bricks. Experimental tests showed bi-modularity (i. e. different Young modulus in compression and tension) for both mortar and bricks, so this feature of elastic behaviour was taken into account in micromodelling. The results are twofold: for each <b>bond</b> <b>scheme,</b> critical curves in the principal stress plane are derived for the homogenised unit cell, and the relationships between the homogenised elastic moduli and the loading angle is obtained. Micromechanical analysis provided a major difference between homogenised elastic behaviour in tension and in compression.

5000|$|Molecular Orbital Theory vs. Valence Bond Theory {{has been}} a topic of debate since the early to mid 1900's. Despite {{continued}} heated debate on which model more accurately depict the true <b>bonding</b> <b>scheme</b> of molecules, scientists now view MO and VB theories as complimentary and teammates. With the development of modern high speed computers and advanced molecular modeling programs, both MO and VB theories are used widely today, though for generally different purposes. In general, MO theory can accurately predict the ground state energy of the system, the different electronic states energies of bonding and nonbonding orbitals, and magnetic and ionization properties in a straight forward manner. On the other hand, VB theory is traditionally useful for predicting bond angle and mechanism drawing. Modern valence bond theory can provide the same electronic information obtained by MO theory, though the process is more complicated. In addition, modern VB theory can also predict excited states energies in which MO theory cannot easily achieve. The truth is, both theories are equally important in understanding chemical bonding that while neither theory is completely comprehensive, the two together nonetheless provides a in-depth model for chemical bonds. In the words of Roald Hoffmann: [...] "Taken together, MO and VB theories constitute not an arsenal, but a tool kit... Insistence on a journey... equipped with one set of tools {{and not the other}} puts one at a disadvantage. Discarding any one of the two theories undermines the intellectual heritage of chemistry." ...|$|E
