5|$|Fighting {{was still}} {{going on in the}} area around Dongo. Fearing that Mussolini and Petacci might be rescued by fascist supporters, the partisans drove them, {{in the middle of the}} night, to a nearby farm of a peasant family named De Maria; they {{believed}} this would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> place to hold them. Mussolini and Petacci spent the rest of the night and most of the following day there.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{significant}} controversy regarding Holden's decision {{to retain the}} Commodore name for the 2018 model, despite it being dimensionally smaller than its predecessor, lacking a V8 engine option and switching from a RWD to a FWD drivetrain. Whilst the decision has been considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> choice {{in order to preserve}} sales, the retention of the Commodore name has been critiqued for Holden missing the opportunity to rebrand its sedan range and push its offering into the more lucrative semi-premium end of the market.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{announcement}} by Richmond Centre MLA Olga Ilich {{that she would}} not be seeking re-election, Howard announced, in January 2008, that he would seek to replace Ilich as the BC Liberal Party candidate in the next election. As no one else came forward to challenge Howard, he was acclaimed, in November 2008, to be the BC Liberal candidate. In the general election, held in May 2009, he was challenged by a New Democratic Party candidate, notary public Kam Brar, and a Green Party candidate, teacher Michael Wolfe, and Nation Alliance Party candidate, accountant Kang Chen. The riding was considered to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> seat for the BC Liberals to win, which the 54-year-old Howard did win with over 60% of the vote, with his BC Liberal Party winning a majority government.|$|E
5|$|The Greenbackers saw {{the impact}} of Civil War loyalties more acutely as they vied for Southern votes. Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour of the South in July and August. Although the local Greenback parties had seen some recent success, the national party, with an ex-Republican Union general {{at the head of}} the ticket, faced more opposition. The party's courtship of black voters, too, threatened the white Democratic establishment, leading to violent outbursts at Weaver's rallies and threats against his supporters. As Weaver campaigned in the North in September and October, Republicans accused him of purposely dividing the vote to help Democrats win a plurality in marginal states. Although Weaver refused to cooperate with Democrats in running fusion slates of presidential electors, in state-level races, Greenback candidates did often combine with Democrats to defeat Republican candidates. In the September gubernatorial race in Maine, one such fusion ticket nominated Harris M. Plaisted, who narrowly defeated the incumbent Republican in what was thought to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> state for that party. The surprise defeat sent a shock through the Garfield campaign, and caused them to rethink their strategy of waving the bloody shirt.|$|E

25|$|Another {{potential}} danger is the UV production of ozone, {{which can be}} harmful to health. The US Environmental Protection Agency designated 0.05 parts per million (ppm) of ozone to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> level. Lamps designed to release UVC and higher frequencies are doped so that any UV light below 254nm wavelengths will not be released, to minimize ozone production. A full-spectrum lamp will release all UV wavelengths, and will produce ozone when UVC hits oxygen (O2) molecules.|$|E

25|$|Overall, Boise is {{considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>safe</b> city.

In 2006, Boise was ranked #1 on Farmer's Insurance list of the most secure places to live. Despite population growth, violent crime has remained {{much the same as}} of 2013, with 600 incidents of violent crime and three murders in that year.|$|E

25|$|Use of pure oats in a {{gluten-free}} diet offers improved {{nutritional value}} {{from the rich}} content of oat protein, vitamins, minerals, fiber, and lipids, but remains controversial because {{a small proportion of}} people with celiac disease react to pure oats.
