40|$|The wit {{and wisdom}} of the common people are {{preserved}} in slang words and phrases which can sometimes be a little baffling or require insider knowledge, as when a Cockney says, 2 ̆ 2 I wouldn 2 ̆ 7 t {{like to be a}} pawnbroker 2 ̆ 7 s sign on a night like this. 2 ̆ 2 (A really cold night can 2 ̆ 2 freeze the balls off a brass monkey, 2 ̆ 2 and a pawnbroker 2 ̆ 7 s sign has, of course, not two but three balls.) Less crude and less complicated, but as amusing perhaps, are the following words and expressions from British slang. How many can you decipher?

6000|$|... "Because they're just nobodies. They are not {{anything}} particular to anybody, {{and so they}} go on living till they die. You know what I mean, Mr. Burgess. A man who is a nobody can perhaps make himself somebody,--or, at any rate, he can try; but a woman has no means of trying. She is a nobody, and a nobody she must remain. She has her clothes and her food, but she isn't wanted anywhere. People put up with her, and that is about the <b>best</b> <b>of</b> her <b>luck.</b> If she were to die somebody perhaps would be sorry for her, but nobody would be worse off. She doesn't earn anything or do any good. She is just there and that's all." ...|$|R

Lennon and McCartney offered Storm to swap drummers (with Best replacing Starr) but Best rejected the idea.

Anthony Thurston made a just will, and her share, while enough to maintain her, is not a large one, but I don't see yet just how it's to be handled. It was the testator's special wish that you should join the trustees, and that her husband should not lay his hands upon a dollar. From careful inquiries made in Vancouver, I judge he's a distinctly bad lot. Anyway, you'll have to help us in the meantime, Geoffrey, and in opening a small bank account I made your signature necessary on every check." ...|$|R
