40|$|As {{part of a}} {{research}} project concerning the agricultural utilization of cut-away peat bogs, a sod production experiment was conducted at Valkeasuo, Tohmajärvi, in 1990 - 1993. The aim of the experiment was to study the effect of nitrogen and choice of cultivar on sod production and sod quality on peat bogs. The N fertilization rates were 50, 100 and 150 kg ha - 1. The Poa pratensis cultivars were 'Conni', 'Cynthia', 'Haga' and 'Julia', the Festuca rubra cultivars were 'Center', 'Juliska', 'Koket' and 'Näpsä' and the Agrostis capillaris cultivar was 'Rasti'. Two mixtures of P. pratensis/F. rubra and one of A. capillaris/F. rubra imitated commercial sod products. Increasing of N fertilization from 50 kg up to 150 kg ha - 1 a had positive effect on general the quality of sod {{as well as on}} the green cover before and after transplanting. It increased the thatch formation. The positive effect of N on the number of tillers and green cover in the year following transplanting was dependent on the species and the cultivar. Species and cultivar affected all measured variables excluding thatch formation. Generally, the P. pratensis cultivars tested suited better for sod production than cultivars of F. rubra, but there were clear differences between cultivars with-in species as well. Although the soil was infertile, the contents of Ca, K, Mg, P, Cu, Fe, Mn, Mo and Zn in the herbage samples were within normal range. The <b>botanical</b> <b>purity</b> was high, which supports the hypothesis that the absence of seed bank of weeds on peat bogs immediately after harvesting the peat can be utilized. ...|$|E
40|$|It was of {{importance}} {{in the evaluation of}} feedingstufrs to know its quantitative composition. A qualitative <b>botanical</b> indicated <b>purity</b> but a quantitative test was needed for the degree of purity. Natural feedstuffs always contained a certain amount of foreign material, which could be considered either as natural or chance contamination. The manufacturer had to ensure that commercial feedstuffs had a high degree of purity. Whenever there was consideration in the trade of standards for purity, it was necessary to be able to check these standards. Ezendam worked out a method of measuring impurities both quantitatively and qualitatively. It was tested on some feedstuffs and thus led the way for microscopic study of feedingstuffs...|$|R
40|$|Consumers {{nowadays}} {{are playing}} {{an active role}} in their health-care. A special case is the increasing number of women, who are reluctant to use exogenous hormone therapy for the treatment of menopausal symptoms and are looking for complementary therapies. However, food supplements are not clearly regulated in Europe. The EFSA has only recently begun to address the issues of <b>botanical</b> safety and <b>purity</b> regulation, leading to a variability of content, standardization, dosage, and purity of available products. In this study, isoflavones (puerarin, daidzin, genistin, daidzein, glycitein, genistein, formononetin, prunetin, and biochanin A) from food supplements (n = 15) for menopausal symptoms relief are evaluated and compared with the labelled information. Only four supplements complied with the recommendations made by the EC on the tolerable thresholds. The intestinal bioavailability of these compounds was investigated using Caco- 2 cells. The apparent permeability coefficients of the selected isoflavonoids across the Caco- 2 cells were affected by the isoflavone concentration and product matrix...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Piper callosum Ruiz & Pav., Piperaceae, {{popularly known}} as &# 8220;elixir-paregórico&# 8221; and &# 8220;matricá&# 8221; in Brazil, is used in folk {{medicine}} to treat gonorrhea, general pain, and digestive disorders, and has repellent, astringent, diuretic, depurative, and haemostatic properties. Despite {{the fact that this}} plant is sold as a traditional phytotherapeutic product, we did not find reports on its quality control. We, therefore, performed macroscopic, microscopic, histochemical, and physicochemical analyses using standard methods to establish <b>botanical</b> authentication and <b>purity</b> degree parameters for leaves and stem of this species in two forms: medicinal plant and herbal drug. We observed the size, shape, color, texture, fracture surface and transection characteristics, leaf venation patterns, and calluses are valuable diagnostic characters to identify the herbal drugs when they are not ground or powdered. Since medicinal plants and herbal drugs did not differ anatomically, the following key anatomical characters for P. callosum can be used for diagnostic purposes of both types raw plant materials: epicuticular wax and cuticular flanges patterns; collenchyma features; fibers in the midrib; arrangement pattern of the vascular bundles of the midrib and petiole; shape of the midrib, leaf margin, petiole, and stem; occurrence of raphides; and morphology of the starch grains. Acid lipids, essential oils, oleoresins, steroids, tannins and flavonoids were histochemically identified. Total ash (leaves: 11. 25 %; stem: 5. 25 %), sulphated ash (leaves: 68. 02 %; stem: 12. 50 %), acid-insoluble ash (leaves: 2. 82 %; stem: 0. 27 %), moisture (leaves: 8. 60 %; stem: 6. 10 %), loss on drying (leaves: 11. 08 %; stem: 8. 58 %), and pH (leaves: 5. 57, stem: 5. 28) values were determined. The order of analyzed metal levels in leaf and stem herbal drugs was Al > V > Cu > Mn > Cr > Ni. Similar levels of Cd and Co and low levels of Hg were found. The results obtained can be used as quality control parameters for medicinal plants and herbal drugs of P. callosum...|$|R
