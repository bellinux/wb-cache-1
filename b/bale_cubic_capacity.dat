50|$|In 1922 Steiger {{produced}} a two-seated roadster {{with a larger}} engine (<b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> 2.8 litres, 55 hp / 40 kW) that became available in 1924 as an even more powerful model (<b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> 2.9 litres, 70 hp / 51 kW). These types reached a maximum speed of 140 km/h (88 mph) (100 hp racing models could reach a speed of 180 km/h (113 mph)) and cost 18,000 Reichsmarks. Those high performance sports and racing models were very successful at racing events (Solituderennen, Avus, Eifelrennen, Klausenrennen, Monza and Targa Florio) in the 1920s. In 1925 came the more powerful touring car, the Steiger 11/55 PS, with an extended wheelbase and the first sports car's engine.|$|R

40|$|Te {{objective}} of the research was determination {{of the impact of}} load-ing capacity of fertilization sets on soil compaction. Degree of soil compaction was determined based on four indexes. Three fertilization sets were selected for research: set A – tractor Renault 95. 14 plus a waste removal vehicle of <b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> of 6 m 3, set B – tractor John Deere 6420 plus a waste removal vehicle 12 m 3, and set C Valtra N 121 plus a waste removal vehicle 8 m 3. Four indexes were deter-mined: field area compaction, loading a field with sets crossings, degree of compaction in the trace of wheels and <b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> of ruts. It was determined that the biggest surface of the compacted field was for the set A (27 %) and the smallest for the set B (16 %). Loading of a field with the sets crossings was the highest also for the set A (212 kN·km·ha- 1) and the lowest for the set B (167 kN·km·ha- 1). Degree of compaction in the trace of wheels was the highest for the set B (105 kN·m- 1) and the lowest for the set A (77 kN·m- 1). The highest <b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> of ruts was determined on the field fertilized with the set A (99 m 3) and the lowest for the set B (61 m 3). From among the technical parameters of fertilization machines the following affect the soil compaction degree: tractor mass and a waste removal vehicle mass and its <b>cubic</b> <b>capacity</b> and the working width, which depends on the application unit which was used. The set B may be recognized as the the best selected fertilization set (a tractor and a waste removal vehicle) on account of soil compaction and the least favourable – the set A.
