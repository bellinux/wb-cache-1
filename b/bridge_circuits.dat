Currently, self-sensing systems that have concurrent actuation and sensing can be made by using a <b>bridge</b> <b>circuit.</b> However, hardware tuning is still needed due to the unstable nature of an imbalanced <b>bridge</b> <b>circuit.</b> This problem becomes serious in the space environment where human beings may not be available to perform the maintenance.

5000|$|It was a low-distortion audio {{oscillator}} used for testing sound equipment. It used the Wien bridge oscillator circuit, {{that had been}} the subject of Bill Hewlett's Masters thesis. It was also the first such commercial oscillator to use a simple light bulb as the temperature-dependent resistor in its feedback network. The light bulb was an inexpensive and effective automatic gain control that not only kept the oscillator output amplitude constant, but it also kept the oscillator's loop gain near unity. The latter is a key technique for achieving a low distortion oscillator. Earlier, Meacham had used light bulbs in <b>bridge</b> <b>circuits</b> to stabilize and linearize oscillators in 1938.|$|E
50|$|Alternatively {{a series}} {{regulator}} can be inserted between the DC supply and the anode. The DC supply provides twice the normal voltage the anode sees. The regulator can allow none {{or all of}} the voltage to pass, or any intermediate value. The audio input operates the regulator {{in such a way as}} to produce the instantaneous anode voltage needed to reproduce the modulation envelope. An advantage of the series regulator is that it can set the anode voltage to any desired value. Thus the power output of the transmitter can be easily adjusted, allowing the use of Dynamic Carrier Control. The use of PDM switching regulators makes this system very efficient, whereas the original analog regulators were very inefficient and also non linear. Series PDM modulators are used in solid state transmitters also, but the circuits are somewhat more complex, using push pull or <b>bridge</b> <b>circuits</b> for the RF section.|$|E
