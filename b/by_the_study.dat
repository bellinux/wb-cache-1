5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of its beak, both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of woodpeckers.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, the NFL {{established}} the Mild Traumatic Brain Injury Committee (MTBI), which was later {{replaced by the}} Head, Neck and Spine Committee, to study concussions and brain injuries in professional football players. The committee and its leadership, including Ira Casson and Elliot Pellman, were criticized by former players for stating {{that there is not}} enough research to determine if concussions lead to permanent brain injury. Pellman, who served as chairman of the committee from 1994 to 2007, received a large amount of criticism because {{he did not have a}} background in neurology and the research he published on brain injuries disagreed with the findings of independent scientists. In 2009, a NFL-commissioned report showed increased incidence of diagnosis of memory loss and dementia among retired professional football players when compared to the general population. The study also indicated that these symptoms were related to the effects of concussions. However, the NFL and the report's own researchers questioned the reliability of some of the data-gathering methods employed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> including the fact that the study was conducted by phone. The same year, the committee acknowledged for the first time that concussions can lead to long-term brain injuries. A Congressional hearing in October 2009, as well as pressure from the National Football League Players Association (NFLPA), led to an overhaul of the concussion policy in November and December of that year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo {{allocated}} $22 million to renew {{planning and design}} efforts for the Second Avenue line, but in 1993 the MTA, facing budget cuts, removed these funds from its capital budget. In 1995, the MTA began its Manhattan East Side Alternatives (MESA) study, both a MIS and a DEIS, seeking ways to alleviate overcrowding on the Lexington Avenue Line and improve mobility on Manhattan's East Side. The study analyzed several alternatives, such as improvements to the Lexington Avenue Line to increase capacity, enhanced bus service with dedicated lanes, and light rail or ferry service on the East Side. Second Avenue was chosen over First Avenue for logistical reasons. In November 1997, the MTA initiated the Lower Manhattan Access Study (LMA) to improve access to Lower Manhattan from the New York City suburbs. The construction of the Second Avenue Subway from 63rd Street to Lower Manhattan {{was one of the}} five build alternatives developed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b>|$|E

If a language other than German is spoken in the home that was correlated with poor mathematical performance in other studies. However correlation does not imply causation and the ELEMENT-study revealed that if other factors were taken into account for the language spoken at home, this had no effect on mathematical performance.|$|E

25|$|Despite this critique, {{reengineering}} {{was adopted}} at an accelerating pace and by 1993, {{as many as}} 60% of the Fortune 500 companies claimed to either have initiated reengineering efforts, or to have plans to do so.

25|$|In the {{writings}} of Muslim scholars, the term Nafs (self or soul) was used to denote individual personality and the term fitrah for human nature.

25|$|The period saw several {{important}} technical innovations, like {{the principle of}} linear perspective found {{in the work of}} Masaccio, and later described by Brunelleschi.

As the centre of the movement shifted to Rome, the period culminated in the High Renaissance masters da Vinci, Michelangelo and Raphael.|$|E
