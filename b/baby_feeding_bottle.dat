The control {{has been carried}} out according to the requirements of the relevant EU legislation and standards. The samples have been collected according to the relevant National Multiannual Control Plan, giving attention and priority to materials which are frequently used, may release toxic substances, are used for baby feeding and have been found non-compliant or notified by the EU RASFF system. The samples have been examined for identity of the material by FT-IR, overall and specific migration, correct labeling and corrosion resistance.

Most of the examined samples were within the relevant EU requirements. Some non compliant samples have been found: ceramic samples for migration of lead and or cadmium, plastic membranes (cling films) for migration of the plasticizer DEHA and incorrect labeling concerning the types of food for which they were intended, black nylon kitchen utensils for primary aromatic amines, plastic gaskets of metallic lid for DIDP (di iso decyl phthalate) or DEHP, baby waters in plastic containers for DEHP, one <b>baby</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>bottle</b> for low resistance to boiling water, some non stick cookware, most of them imported from third countries...|$|E
40|$|Silver {{migration}} from a commercial <b>baby</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>bottle</b> and a food box containing AgNPs, as confirmed by SEM-EDX analysis, was evaluated using food simulant solutions [i. e., water, 3 % (v/v) acetic acid, and 10 % and 90 % (v/v) ethanol]. Silver release was investigated at {{temperatures in the}} 20 - 70 °C range using contact times of up to 10 days. Migration of silver from the food box was in all cases 2 to 3 orders of magnitude higher than that observed for the baby bottle, although the total silver content in the original box material was half of that found in the baby bottle. As expected, for both food containers, silver migration depended on both {{the nature of the}} tested solution and the applied conditions. The highest release was observed for 3 % acetic acid at 70 °C for 2 h, corresponding to 62 ng dm and 1887 ng dm of silver for the baby bottle and the food box, respectively. Single particle-inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (SP-ICPMS) was used to characterise and quantify AgNPs in the food simulants extracts. Sample preparation was optimized to preserve AgNPs integrity. The experimental parameters affecting AgNPs detection, sizing and quantification by SP-ICPMS were also optimised. Analyses of water and acidic extracts revealed the presence of both dissolved silver and AgNPs. Small AgNPs (in the 18 - 30 nm range) and particle number concentrations within the 4 - 1510 10 L range were detected, corresponding to only 0. 1 - 8. 6 % of the total silver released from these materials. The only exception was AgNPs migrated into water at 40 °C and 70 °C from the food box, which accounted for as much as 34 % and 69 % of the total silver content, respectively.

40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} result {{evaluation}} of a project {{under the auspices of}} the EAA and Norway Grants, which ran from 2015 to 2016. The project's goal was to evaluate water quality at sites with native and invasive crayfish. The project also included monitoring organic substances such as Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). I mainly focused on a subset of PBDEs, the brominated flame retardants (BFRs). These substances have been monitored since the 1970 s, when food was accidentally contaminated leading to the contamination of the nearby area in the US. What is alarming is their persistence in the environment, which leads to their constantly increasing levels. Information about the transformation and biodegradation of PBDEs in the environment is still limited and is continually analyzed in new studies. These substances are poorly volatile and insoluble, which makes dust and particles arising from the products containing BPAs the main sources of contact. Another agent, whose presence in the environment of the Czech Republic I analyzed, is Bisphenol A (BPA). BPA is used in the production of epoxy resins and polycarbonate plastics. BPA is a toxic substance with the ability to disrupt hormone function. <b>Baby</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> have been confirmed to contain these compounds. In April 2004, the Czech government approved a (program to reduce pollution of surface waters by dangerous harmful substances). In August 2004, the EU enacted a ban on the sale and use of penta-BDE and octa-BDE in all fields. Since 2011, Bisphenol A may not be used in the manufacture of <b>baby</b> <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles.</b> The goal of this thesis is to analyze and evaluate the amount and possible consequences of these substances in our environment, which are alarming even after full or partial bans on the use of these substances...|$|R

In a first step, human estrogen receptor agonistic and antagonistic activities of pure compounds (known to be used as altenatives to BPA) as well as baby bottles extracts will be measured using ER-CALUX cells (genetically modified MCF- 7 cells), as well as cytotoxicity. Preliminary test with 3 Bisphenols (BPs) have been performed: BPA, Bisphenol S (BPS) and Bisphenol F (BPF).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: In {{intensive}} care patients, enteral feeding requires sterile feedings because of infectious complications and adequate supplements to meet nutritional needs. Heretofore, prepacked, large-volume formula containers were developed, but bacterial contamination occurred in 4 % to 15 %. Our {{objective was to}} investigate the microbial contamination rate of 1 -L <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> and newly designed administration sets over hanging times of 24 hrs in the {{intensive care}} unit (ICU). DESIGN AND SETTING: A prospective observational cohort study of patients admitted to the ICU of a university hospital. PATIENTS: All consecutive patients fed via a nasojejunal tube for at least 4 days. MEASUREMENTS: Cultures of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles,</b> administration sets, and gastric and tracheobronchial aspirates at day 0, 1, 2, 4, and 7. RESULTS: A total of 4 % of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> and 74 % of infusion sets contained > 10 (2) colony forming units (CFU) /mL. Gastric and bronchial aspirates were positive in 90 % and 92 %, respectively. Bacterial counts of <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> were 10 (2) - 10 (5) CFU/mL, and the main bacteria isolated included Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and enterococci. One third of all cultured bacteria in <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles,</b> administration sets, stomach, and lungs belonged to the Enterobacteriaceae family, which was held responsible for the nosocomial infections in the ICU. None of the 1 -L <b>feeding</b> <b>bottles</b> with a hanging time of 19 - 24 hrs was contaminated. Only bottles that had to be exchanged because of need for a faster rate of infusion proved to be contaminated, apparently without clinical consequences. With time and the increasing severity of disease, the administration sets became contaminated at an increasingly faster rate and with higher bacterial counts mainly through retrograde growth of endogenous bacteria. The final step of bottle contamination might have been the bacterial transfer by nurses' hands. CONCLUSION: Despite an almost ideal design of the enteral nutrition delivery system, a 4 % contamination rate of initially sterile feedings with clinically relevant bacteria and the fact that only manipulated systems showed bacterial growth are of concer...|$|R

The mean number of breastfeedings in a day (in the mixed feed group) was 5. 83 ± 1. 93 at 21 - 28 days and 4. 42 ± 1. 67 at 3 - 5 months. In the equivalence analysis of the mixed feed group, the 95 % confidence interval for bottle feeding/breastfeeding ratio laid outside the range of equivalence, indicating 5. 9 - 8. 7 % fewer suction movements, and fewer pauses, and shorter duration of them in <b>bottle</b> <b>feeding</b> compared with breastfeeding. Conclusions The mechanics of sucking in mixed feeding lay outside the range of equivalence comparing <b>bottle</b> <b>feeding</b> with breastfeeding, although differences were small. Children with mixed feeding would mix both types of sucking movements (breastfeeding and <b>bottle</b> <b>feeding)</b> during the learning stage and adopt their own pattern. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the extent to which dental prevention among Turkish parents differs from that among Moroccan parents in one of the large cities in the Netherlands. Design: Turkish and Moroccan mothers with a child of approximately six months old, who visited the well baby clinics in the Schilderswijk area of The Hague, were asked to participate in a dental care project. As part of the initial data collection in this project, 170 Turkish and 153 Moroccan mothers were interviewed at home by a woman who spoke their native languages. The interview contained questions about dental prevention, such as fluoride use, <b>feeding</b> <b>bottle</b> use, visits to the dentist, brushing, information about oral care, and about relevant background characteristics. Results: More Moroccan than Turkish mothers reported that they did not use a <b>feeding</b> <b>bottle</b> for the <b>baby,</b> went to the dentist twice a year, brushed their own teeth at least twice a day and started to brush their children's teeth at an early age. The Moroccan mothers were more committed to dental prevention than Turkish mothers, even after correction for background characteristics such as education, language skills and the number of years spent in the Netherlands. Conclusions: Ethnic groups should not be seen as a single group for dental prevention. It is recommended that Turkish parents in particular be encouraged to go to the dentist twice a year, to start brushing their children's teeth at an early age and to wean their children off use of a <b>feeding</b> <b>bottle</b> in bed...|$|R
