5|$|The Holliday {{junction}} {{is a key}} intermediate in homologous recombination, a <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> {{that increases}} genetic diversity by shifting genes between two chromosomes, as well as site-specific recombination events involving integrases. They are additionally involved in repair of double-strand breaks. In addition, cruciform structures involving Holliday junctions can arise to relieve helical strain in symmetrical sequences in DNA supercoils. While four-arm junctions also appear in functional RNA molecules, such as U1 spliceosomal RNA and the hairpin ribozyme of the tobacco ringspot virus, these usually contain unpaired nucleotides in between the paired double-helical domains, and thus do not strictly adopt the Holliday structure.|$|E

The number of affected <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> ranged from 37 {{in the liver}} to 108 in the lung (Figure 1 B) [see Additional file 1]. In general, affected dose-specific <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> were more frequent compared to the affected processes observed at all absorbed dose levels. In the lung, which had {{the highest number of}} modulated <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> (108 processes), only 6 processes were detected at two or more absorbed dose levels. This can be compared to the liver, which had the lowest number of modulated <b>biological</b> <b>processes</b> (37 processes), where as many as 17 processes were detected at two or more absorbed dose levels.|$|R

5|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) is a <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> {{in which}} RNA molecules inhibit gene expression or translation, by neutralizing targeted mRNA molecules. Historically, {{it was known}} by other names, including co-suppression, post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), and quelling. Only after these apparently unrelated processes were fully understood did it become clear that they all described the RNAi phenomenon. Andrew Fire and Craig C. Mello shared the 2006 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their work on RNA interference in the nematode worm Caenorhabditis elegans, which they published in 1998. Since the discovery of RNAi and its regulatory potentials, it has become evident that RNAi has immense potential in suppression of desired genes. RNAi {{is now known as}} precise, efficient, stable and better than antisense technology for gene suppression.|$|E
5|$|Sociobiology is {{the study}} of how social {{behaviour}} and organization have been influenced by evolution and other <b>biological</b> <b>process.</b> The field blends sociology with a number of other sciences, such as anthropology, biology, and zoology. Sociobiology has generated controversy within the sociological academy for allegedly giving too much attention to gene expression over socialization and environmental factors in general (see 'nature versus nurture'). Entomologist E. O. Wilson is credited as having originally developed and described Sociobiology. Besides Sociobiology the bio-communication theory investigates interactions between non-human organisms such as animal communication, plant communication, fungal communication and communication in micro-organisms on the basis of rule-governed sign-use. In this respect any coordination of behaviour between at least two organisms is sign-mediated that underlies combinatorial (syntactic), context-dependent (pragmatic) and content-relevant (semantic) rules.|$|E
5|$|Today, many {{wildebeest}} {{populations are}} experiencing rapid declines. Overland migration as a <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> requires large connected landscapes, which are {{increasingly difficult to}} maintain, particularly over the long term, when human demands on the landscape compete. The most acute threat comes from migration barriers, such as fences and roads. In {{one of the more}} striking examples of the consequences of fence-building on terrestrial migrations, Botswanan authorities placed thousands of kilometres of fences across the Kalahari that prevented wildebeests from reaching watering holes and grazing grounds, resulting in the deaths {{of tens of thousands of}} individuals, reducing the wildebeest population to less than 10% of its previous size. Illegal hunting is a major conservation concern in many areas, along with natural threats posed by main predators (such as lions, leopards, hunting dogs and hyenas). Where the black and blue wildebeest share a common range, the two can hybridise, and this is regarded as a potential threat to the black wildebeest.|$|E

5|$|Isotype {{or class}} {{switching}} is a <b>biological</b> <b>process</b> occurring after {{activation of the}} B cell, which allows the cell to produce different classes of antibody (IgA, IgE, or IgG). The different classes of antibody, and thus effector functions, are defined by the constant (C) regions of the immunoglobulin heavy chain. Initially, naive B cells express only cell-surface IgM and IgD with identical antigen binding regions. Each isotype is adapted for a distinct function; therefore, after activation, an antibody with an IgG, IgA, or IgE effector function might be required to effectively eliminate an antigen. Class switching allows different daughter cells from the same activated B cell to produce antibodies of different isotypes. Only the constant region of the antibody heavy chain changes during class switching; the variable regions, and therefore antigen specificity, remain unchanged. Thus the progeny of a single B cell can produce antibodies, all specific for the same antigen, but {{with the ability to}} produce the effector function appropriate for each antigenic challenge. Class switching is triggered by cytokines; the isotype generated depends on which cytokines are present in the B cell environment.|$|E
