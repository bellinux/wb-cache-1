The methodology {{is based on a}} non-parametric production frontier estimation. The empirical application is made to 1084 Belarusian corporate farms. The results suggest targeting governmental support at grain and milk production. In this case, 4. 14 trillion <b>Belarusian</b> <b>roubles</b> of subsidies increase the overall profit of the sample farms by 1. 46 trillion.
