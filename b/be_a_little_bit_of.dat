5|$|We knew {{we wanted}} to make a dance record. But you know, there's so many {{different}} levels of dance music and even different categories of house music. So, it was really like, what's the bass line gonna sound like? Is it gonna be really stripped down and sparse, or {{is it going to be}} loaded up? Is it gonna be Chicago house? Is it gonna be U.K. house? It's like, all over the place. Is it gonna <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> one vocal line? Is it gonna be a whole choir singing? So we were experimenting and trying out different things. They all sounded good, but at the end of the day, we wanted it to sound timeless, also. Not just something of the moment.|$|E

Aguilera commented about the collaboration with Matsoukas, [...] "Once we started talking {{with each other and}} she heard 'Your Body,' she spun {{it in a way that}} you wouldn't expect at all. And I get to play this character that, yeah, she may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> a badass, she's very confident, self-assured, but she's super playful and super tongue-in-cheek. She laughs the whole way through the video. She's watching cartoons, and you know she doesn't take herself too seriously." ...|$|E

Gordon described Martha's persona stating: [...] "Martha's pretty feisty {{all of the time}} but in the sense of always fighting for what's right and keeping up a strong perspective on where I want to go, things like that." [...] Gordon says that she feels Martha always makes bad choices when it comes to her love life, because she never knows what she wants. Gordon said that Martha is [...] "messed up" [...] but with a [...] "warm side" [...] to her persona, and that overall Martha is [...] "fun loving, easy going girl-next-door" [...] type character. Of her portrayal, Gordon says that she enjoys the challenge of playing Martha because she gets to shout a lot when showing her crazy and fun side. Gordon later said that [...] "There will always <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> trouble attached to Martha. She will always be a little bit mischievous". On the character's appearance, RTÉ said [...] "Martha was a self-confessed tomboy, loving sport and anything physical. Now she has grown into a stylish woman with great taste in clothes which range from shorts and strappy tops to gorgeous summer dresses." ...|$|E

In the end I realized that I will always <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> everything and I don't have to choose, I am sometimes extremely sensitive, sometimes upbeat, others dreamy and romantic, and even at times a little melodramatic.

But it {{will not}} be in your power yet awhile to draw from any objects in which the {{gradations}} are varied and complicated; nor will it be a bad omen for your future progress, and for the use that art is to be made of by you, if the first thing at which you aim should <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> <b>bit</b> <b>of</b> sky. So take any narrow space of evening sky, that you can usually see, between the boughs of a tree, or between two chimneys, or through the corner of a pane in the window you like best to sit at, and try to gradate a little space of white paper as evenly as that is gradated--as tenderly you cannot gradate it without color, no, nor with color either; but you may do it as evenly; or, if you get impatient with your spots and lines of ink, {{when you look at the}} beauty of the sky, the sense you will have gained of that beauty is something to be thankful for. But you ought not to be impatient with your pen and ink; for all great painters, however delicate their perception of color, are fond of the peculiar effect of light which may be got in a pen-and-ink sketch, and in a wood-cut, by the gleaming of the white paper between the black lines; and if you cannot gradate well with pure black lines, you will never gradate well with pale ones. By looking at any common wood-cuts, in the cheap publications of the day, you may see how gradation is given to the sky by leaving the lines farther and farther apart; but you must make your lines as fine as you can, as well as far apart, towards the light; and do not try to make them long or straight, but let them cross irregularly in any directions easy to your hand, depending on nothing but their gradation for your effect. On this point of direction of lines, however, I shall have to tell you more, presently; in the meantime, do not trouble yourself about it.|$|E
