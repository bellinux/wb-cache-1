5|$|The Elves, {{particularly}} the Noldor, preoccupy themselves with various {{things such as}} smithwork, sculpture, music and other arts, and of course, what to eat. Males and females can do almost everything equally; however, the females often specialize in the arts of healing while the males go to war. This is <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> taking life interferes {{with the ability to}} preserve life. However, Elves are not stuck in rigid roles; females can defend themselves at need as well as males, and many males are skilled healers as well, such as Elrond.|$|E
5|$|Although condoms {{effectively}} {{prevent the}} sexual transmission of HIV, several factors have limited widespread condom distribution and uptake in Malawi. People living in non-urban areas often have difficulty accessing condoms, and condoms are not typically available at bars {{and other social}} locations where {{they could have a}} significant impact on HIV prevention. Many people oppose condoms <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> condoms make sex less enjoyable or because they question their ability to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, despite these factors, many unmarried couples have started using condoms more consistently as concern and fear about the HIV/AIDS epidemic have increased.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that schoolchildren in Malawi {{are at risk}} of being exposed to HIV by their teachers, who sometimes value them as sexual partners <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> children have not yet been exposed to the virus. Children are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by adults who offer them money in exchange for sex; because they are often unable to afford basic necessities, they might feel compelled to accept gifts in exchange for sex out of desperation. Interviews indicate that teachers and school administrators in Malawi often misinterpret the definition of sexual assault, as some believe that sexual relations between teachers and students are appropriate as long as the children have consented. Although most schools have strict policies against sexual abuse, children are often hesitant to accuse adults of wrongdoing, and many administrators are unwilling or unable to investigate the truth behind the accusations.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm {{the course of the}} world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.|$|E
25|$|Many {{explanations}} for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see.

These explanations include self-enhancement, self-presentation, and perceived control.|$|E

25|$|The Druze {{religion}} branched {{off from}} the religion of Islam, and although it is considered as its own religion separate from Islam, some Druze people still consider themselves to be Muslims. The religion {{was created in the}} 10th and 11th centuries in Egypt with aspects of Hindu and Greek philosophy incorporated into the tenets of Islam. Conversions are not permitted in the Druze religion, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the first generation after the establishment of the Druze religion had an opportunity then to join the religion, and everyone alive today is reincarnated from that generation. Much like the Abrahamic faiths, the Druze religion is monotheistic, and recognize many prophets including Jesus, John the Baptist, Mohammed, and Moses. Their most respected prophet in their religion is Jethro, Moses' father-in-law.|$|E

Though the five men that are {{disappeared}} hold only Mexican citizenships, three of the abductees hold U.S. citizenships and others were legal residents of the U.S. The family wants to the U.S. to investigate the case <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> the Gulf Cartel fears the involvement of U.S. authorities (according to the Cázares, a 9-year-old boy who was kidnapped from the first home was dropped off one of the international bridges in Matamoros after the kidnappers found out that he was a U.S. citizen and that his mother had contacted the FBI). The family also sent letters to U.S. President Barack Obama and to Pope Benedict XVI, and asked the latter to speak about the case with President Calderón during his visit to Mexico in March 2012. Barbier also sent letters to Catholic cardinals in the archdioceses of New York, Berlin, Paris, and Munich and Freising, asking them to pray for her family members that were missing. They received the same petition letters the family sent to President Calderón in their respective languages.|$|E

Shias also criticize him for fiercely opposing the message of Islam and fighting the Prophet Muhammad and Ali, for example, at the Battle of Uhud.

There, he fought them and ordered killing of all the captives, which was met with opposition and protests from other Muslims.

500|$|The Satanic Bible is a {{collection}} of essays, observations, and rituals published by Anton LaVey in 1969. It is the central religious text of LaVeyan Satanism, and is considered the foundation of its philosophy and dogma. It has been described as the most important document to influence contemporary Satanism. Though The Satanic Bible is not considered to be sacred scripture {{in the way that the}} Christian Bible is to Christianity, LaVeyan Satanists regard it as an authoritative text as it is a contemporary text that has attained for them scriptural status. It extols the virtues of exploring one's own nature and instincts. Believers have been described as [...] "atheistic Satanists" [...] <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> God is not an external entity, but rather something that each person creates as a projection of his or her own personality—a benevolent and stabilizing force in his or her life.

500|$|On June 16, 2007, 200 people {{gathered}} in a protest organized by Pro Cologne against the mosque including representatives from the Austrian Freedom Party and the Belgian Vlaams Belang. Then district deputy mayor Uckermann seconded that he thinks many residents reject the mosque <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> Cologne is a “Christian city”. The prominent author Ralph Giordano stated that he opposed the project as the mosque would be “an expression of the creeping Islamization of our land”, a “declaration of war”, and that he wouldn't want to see women wearing headscarfs on German streets, likening their appearance to “human penguins”. Henryk M. Broder, a journalist, disagrees with Giordano's metaphor but said that “A mosque {{is more than a}} church or a synagogue. It is a political statement.” Giordano's remarks have turned the local dispute into a national debate about the place of Islam in Germany. and other prominent Germans criticized the project as well. District mayor Uckermann stated that Giordano's comments “broke down the wall. Before if you criticised this monstrous mosque you were a Nazi. But we {{have a problem with the}} integration of Muslims. It's a question of language and culture.” Uckermann left the conservative CDU for right-wing Pro Cologne in 2008 after being voted out of office as the district's deputy mayor and reportedly facing party exclusion.The city's official for integration Marlis Bredehorst stated that [...] "it is important that the Muslims here get dignified houses of prayer" [...] and added that [...] "two hundred years ago, the Protestants had to pray secretively in Catholic Cologne [...] that is something we can't imagine anymore today." [...] The city's mayor, Fritz Schramma, who supports the project said that “For me, it is self-evident that the Muslims need to have a prestigious place of worship, but it bothers me when people have lived here for 35 years and they don’t speak a single word of German.” Christian leaders have taken similarly ambivalent stances: the Catholic Church has long supported the project, though recently Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop of Cologne, has been more cautious: when asked if he was afraid of the mosque, he said, “I don't want to say I'm afraid, but I have an uneasy feeling.” He also stated that Turkey should allow its Christian minorities equivalent rights. He said the mosque would change the skyline of Cologne. Wolfgang Huber, Germany's top Protestant bishop, criticized the “male domination” he saw in Islam and said Muslims should be able to convert to Christianity without fearing reprisals and the penalty of death.|$|E
