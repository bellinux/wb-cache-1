This artwork consists of <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymer</b> films sandwiched between two polarizers, {{similar to a}} polariscope. We explain quantitatively the main features observed in Comarow's work.

These devices separate the TE and TM polarizations onto different vertical levels of a three-dimensionally integrated optic circuit. This provides increased integration density for polarization diverse structures. The vertical polarization splitters utilize <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymer</b> materials to create an adiabatic structure.

40|$|Dynamic photoviscoelastic {{analysis}} {{requires the}} time and temperature dependency of the material {{to be taken into}} account. Mechanical relaxation processes have generally been incorporated in dynamic analysis, but there has been no widespread application of optical relaxation or creep functions over the complete time spectrum in photomechanics of <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymers.</b> Using material characterizations previously developed, this study compares a theoretical viscoelastic solution and its predicted fringe pattern for stresswave propagation in a thin rod of polyurethan material (Solithane 113) with the photoviscoelastic data from a similar experimental arrangement. The agreement demonstrates both the validity and general necessity of such an approach for the time-domain characteristic of wave-propagation phenomena in low-modulus polymers...|$|R
25|$|The LCD {{backlight}} {{systems are}} made highly efficient by applying optical {{films such as}} prismatic structure to gain the light into the desired viewer directions and reflective polarizing films that recycle the polarized light that was formerly absorbed by the first polarizer of the LCD (invented by Philips researchers Adrianus de Vaan and Paulus Schaareman), generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M. These polarizers consist of a large stack of uniaxial oriented birefringent films that reflect the former absorbed polarization mode of the light. Such reflective polarizers using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (<b>birefringent</b> <b>polymers</b> or <b>birefringent</b> glue) are invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring. The combination of such reflective polarizers, and LED dynamic backlight control make today's LCD televisions far more efficient than the CRT-based sets, leading to a worldwide energy saving of 600 TWh (2017), equal to 10% of the electricity consumption of all households worldwide or equal to 2 times the energy production of all solar cells in the world.|$|R

The dielectric {{and optical}} anisotropy is captured by photo-polymerization. The balls are Electro-Mechano-Optical (ElMO) {{in that they}} undergo a mechanical reorientation {{in the presence of}} an applied electric field, and therefore may be useful for display applications. We show that our spheres are suited for both conventional electrode arrangements and in-plane switching modes.

40|$|Reactive mesogens (RMs) are polymerisable liquid {{crystals}} {{that can}} be formed {{through the process of}} in-situ photopolymerisation into thin birefringent films. These films have found applications as optical films (retarders) in the flat panel display industry. Application of the birefringent films requires homogeneous orientation of the optical axis over the film’s surface. We report high quality fast photoalignment of reactive mesogens on surfaces of cellulose-cinnamate polymers. Unique photosensitivity of cellulose-cinnamates and high quality photo-orientation of reactive mesogenes on these polymers allow cellulose-cinnamates to be considered as promising materials for producing thin <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymer</b> films by roll-to-roll technology. 1...|$|E
40|$|Two highly <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymer</b> {{terahertz}} (THz) fibers were {{proposed in}} this paper, which were formed with honeycomb cladding and some elliptical air {{holes in the}} fiber core. The losses and mode birefringence for two different fibers are investigated by finite-different time-domain method. The results show that fiber 2 can achieve both high birefringence (larger than 0. 022) and low confinement loss (0. 01 dB/m) in a wide THz frequency range. Moreover, compared with a round solid-core fiber, guiding loss of the THz fiber caused by polymer material absorption can be reduced effectively {{as a part of}} the mode power is trapped in the air holes...|$|E
30|$|Optical linear retarders {{are very}} useful {{components}} for any optical application requiring {{control of the}} state of polarization [1]. High quality retarders are usually fabricated with anisotropic optical materials such as quartz or calcite. Lower cost retarders are fabricated with <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymers,</b> having additionally the advantage of being produced with much larger areas. Tunable retarders can be fabricated with liquid crystal (LC) materials, where the application of a relative low voltage yields a large variation of the effective retardance, due to the tilt of the liquid-crystal director. Liquid crystal retarders (LCR) can be manufactured {{in the form of a}} single retarder element, or in the form of one or two-dimensional arrays, as in the liquid-crystal on silicon (LCOS) displays [2]. Other tunable retarders are fabricated with electro-optic materials, such as lithium niobate (LiNbO 3). They require higher voltages and have much smaller areas than LC retarders, but can be switched at much faster rates [3]. Therefore, these tunable retarders are becoming very useful in all kind of applications that require programmable control of the intensity, the phase, or the state of polarization of an input light beam, thus becoming key components in advanced optical instruments for optical microscopy, interferometry, polarimetry or optical communications.|$|R

The fiber exhibits high birefringence in each of the cores as well as relatively weak coupling between the cores. Spectral dependence of the group and the phase modal birefringence was measured using an interferometric method. We have also measured the sensing characteristics of the fiber such as polarimetric sensitivity to hydrostatic pressure, strain and temperature. Moreover, we have studied the effect of hydrostatic pressure and strain on coupling between the cores...|$|R

The colloidal was stable through the polymerization process only at specific compositions. The system revealed a lamellar water structure which housed the gamma initiated reaction prior and after polymerization the lamellar was <b>birefringent.</b> The <b>polymer</b> was characterized for its size and distribution. SANS which was employed to measure the colloidal system for swelling of the lamellar phase during all sections of the polymerization process showed a consistant lamellar thickest through all multicomponent transitions. The system was also observed under high shear showing thinning viscosity for synthesized polyacrylamide and a yield viscosity for very high molecular weight linear polyacrylamide...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} and experimentally {{demonstrate a}} technique for performing quantum state tomography on multiple-qubit states despite incomplete {{knowledge about the}} unitary operations used to change the measurement basis. Given unitary operations with unknown rotation angles, our method {{can be used to}} reconstruct the density matrix of the state up to local σ̂z rotations as well as recover the magnitude of the unknown rotation angle. We demonstrate high-fidelity self-calibrating tomography on polarization-encoded one- and two-photon states. The unknown unitary operations are realized in two ways: using a <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymer</b> sheet—an inexpensive smartphone screen protector—or alternatively a liquid crystal wave plate with a tuneable retardance. We explore how our technique may be adapted for quantum state tomography of systems such as biological molecules where the magnitude and orientation of the transition dipole moment is not known with high accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Numerical and {{experimental}} investigation of frictional sliding under dynamic loading conditions is dis-cussed. The configuration analyzed {{consists of two}} plates of Homalite (an elastic <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymer</b> material) connected along a planar interface. The plates are characterized as isotropic elastic materials and the interface {{is characterized by a}} rate- and state-dependent frictional law that also accounts for dependence on normal stress variations. The calculations are carried out within a framework where two constitutive relations are used: a vol-umetric constitutive relation between stress and strain and a surface constitutive relation that characterizes the frictional behavior of an interface. The propagation speeds of the sliding tip are found to be of the order of the longitudinal wave speed. Frictional sliding is found to occur in modes that involve uniform sliding behind the rupture front, an isolated slip pulse, multiple slip pulses or a combination of these modes. The dependence of the sliding mode on the initial compressive stress, the impact velocity and the friction parameters is described. Numerical results compare favorably with experimental observations in terms of intersonic sliding tip speed, crack-like and pulse-like sliding modes and the stress fields at the sliding tip. ...|$|E
40|$|Novel <b>birefringent</b> {{liquid crystal}} <b>polymer</b> homeotropic films have been coated on {{semiconductor}} solar cells {{to improve the}} effective incident sunlight angles. The liquid crystal polymer precursor, based on reactive mesogens, is fluidic and flows like liquid. It would distribute uniformly on the solar cell sample surface by any traditional coating technique. The birefringence for light, due to the liquid crystal retardation properties, manipulated the optical length and the deflection of incident light, thus allowed {{an increase in the}} energy conversion efficiency. The expensive sunlight tracking systems could be avoided. The processing parameters can be tuned such as different mesogen concentrations and plate speeds of spin-coating. The results showed that the solar cell conversion efficiency was improved from 14. 56 % to 14. 85 % at an incident sunlight angle of 15 °. It was further improved from 13. 40 % to 13. 81 % when the angle was 30 °. The interesting angular dependency on solar cell efficiency enhancement has been evaluated...|$|R
40|$|An analytic, {{asymptotic}} {{approximation of}} the nonlinear steady-state equations for viscoelastic creeping flow, modeled by the Oldroyd-B equations with polymer stress diffusion, is derived. Near the extensional stagnation point the flow stretches and aligns polymers along the outgoing streamlines of the stagnation point {{resulting in a}} stress-island, or <b>birefringent</b> strand. The <b>polymer</b> stress diffusion coefficient is used, both, as an asymptotic parameter and a regularization parameter. The structure of the singular part of polymer stress tensor is a Gaussian aligned with the incoming streamline of the stagnation point; a smoothed δ-distribution whose width {{is proportional to the}} square-root of the diffusion coefficient. The amplitude of the stress island scales with the Wiessenberg number and, although singular in the limit of vanishing diffusion, it is integrable in the cross stream direction due to its vanishing width; this yields a convergent secondary flow. The leading order velocity response to this stress island is constructed and shown to be independent of the diffusion coefficient in the limit. The secondary circulation counteracts the forced flow and has a vorticity jump at the location of the stress islands, essentially expelling the background vorticity from the location of the birefringent strands. The analytic solutions are shown to be in excellent quantitative agreement with full numerical simulations and, therefore, the analytic solutions elucidate the salient mechanisms of the flow response to viscoelasticity and the mechanism for instability...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{incorporating}} Au(CN) 2 ¯ with zinc(II) and lead(II) to form diamagnetic coordination polymers. These cations were chosen {{based on the}} materials properties of previous Au(CN) 2 ¯ containing coordination polymers. Four polymorphic forms of Zn[Au(CN) 2] 2 were synthesized. A zinc(II) centre in a tetrahedral geometry was always observed with Au(CN) 2 ¯ units at each tetrahedral vertex. 3 -D networks based on corner-sharing tetrahedra with various degrees of interpenetration were formed. Gold-gold interactions of 3. 11 [...] 3. 33 Å link the networks. Three polymorphs are luminescent, with emissions ranging from 390 [...] 480 nm. Upon exposure to ammonia vapour, the polymers alter their structure and emission energies. The adsorption route {{is dependent on the}} polymorph used. Five lead(II) -coordination polymers, Pb(H 2 O) [Au(CN) 2] 2, Pb[Au(CN) 2] 2, Pb(phenanthroline) 2 [Au(CN) 2] 2, Pb(bipyridine) 2 [Au(CN) 2] 2, and Pb(ethylenediamine) [Au(CN) 2] 2 were synthesized {{in order to determine the}} type of polymers lead(II) and Au(CN) 2 ¯ produced; the polymers were also investigated by solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The more basic the ligand, and/or the less π-accepting the ligand, the more stereochemically active the lead(II) lone pair is. The span and isotropic chemical shift parameters of the 207 Pb NMR increase with lone pair activity. The birefringence of Pb(H 2 O) [Au(CN) 2] 2 is 0. 070. Substituting the water molecules in Pb(H 2 O) [Au(CN) 2] 2 with terpyridine produced a polymer with a birefringence of 0. 396. Substituting Au(CN) 2 ¯ with Ag(CN) 2 ¯, or lead(II) with manganese(II) elicits no significant change in the birefringence, which was thus attributed to the terpyridine ligand aligned face-to-face by the polymer framework. Substituting the terpyridine with other terpyridine-based ligands such as 2 -(2 -pyridyl) - 1, 10 -phenanthroline or 42 ̆ 7 -Bromo/Chloro- 2, 22 ̆ 7 : 62 ̆ 7, 22 ̆ 72 ̆ 7 -terpyridine produces polymers with birefringences ranging from 0. 26 to 0. 59. A recipe for <b>birefringent</b> coordination <b>polymers</b> was thus developed: Highly anisotropically polarizable ligands with judiciously substituted halogen atoms arranged face-to-face on a M[Au(CN) 2] 2 polymer framework. Related bismuth(III) and thallium(I) compounds with Au(CN) 2 ¯ were synthesized and structurally characterized as proof-of-principle. Most bismuth(III) polymers, such as [Bi(terpyridine) (H 2 O) (μ-OH) ] 2 [Au(CN) 2] 4 formed hydroxide-bridged dimers. Acidic (HNO 3) synthetic conditions generated a series of compounds, including Bi(phenanthroline) 2 [Au(CN) 2](NO 3) 2. H 2 O, which contained a short bisumth(III) -gold(I) interaction. The thallium(I) polymer Tl(phenanthroline) [Au(CN) 2] shows a parallel alignment of the phenanthroline and Au(CN) 2 ¯ units. This thesis clearly demonstrates that rational design of coordination polymers is a powerful tool...|$|R
40|$|Our {{concern here}} is to {{rationalize}} experimental observations of failure modes brought about by indentation of hard thin ceramic films deposited on metallic substrates. By undertaking this exercise, {{we would like to}} evolve an analytical framework {{that can be used for}} designs of coatings. In Part I of the paper we develop an algorithm and test it for a model system. Using this analytical framework we address the issue of failure of columnar TiN films in Part II [J. Mater. Res. 21, 783 (2006) ] of the paper. In this part, we used a previously derived Hankel transform procedure to derive stress and strain in a <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymer</b> film glued to a strong substrate and subjected to spherical indentation. We measure surface radial strains using strain gauges and bulk film stresses using photo elastic technique (stress freezing). For a boundary condition based on Hertzian traction with no film interface constraint and assuming the substrate constraint to be a function of the imposed strain, the theory describes the stress distributions well. The variation in peak stresses also demonstrates the usefulness of depositing even a soft film to protect an underlying substrate...|$|E
40|$|Direct laser {{writing is}} a {{powerful}} nonlinear fabrication technique that provides high intensities in the focal plane of a sample to engineer multidimensional structures with submicron feature sizes. Dielectrically and optically anisotropic soft matter {{is of particular interest}} when considering a host medium in which exotic topological characteristics may be generated. In this manuscript, we adopt a novel approach for direct laser writing of polymeric structures, whereby the photo-sensitive resin is liquid crystalline (LC) and aligned within electrically addressable LC devices. We show that the laser written polymer structures retain the optical properties of the liquid crystal resin at the point of laser exposure. Thus, <b>birefringent</b> <b>polymer</b> structures can be written, with the orientation of the optic axis tuned during fabrication through switching the liquid crystal with an applied electric field. This gives the potential to create complex spatial variations of the polymer refractive index on a micron scale. Furthermore, we present a range of structures for controlling the liquid crystal alignment in devices, including two-dimensional arrays of polymer pillars, a polymer checkerboard that creates a controllable disclination network, and 3 -dimensional helical polymer ribbons and knots. This work introduces a new degree of freedom for the direct laser writing of advanced photonic materials as well as offering significant advances for the control of soft matter...|$|E
