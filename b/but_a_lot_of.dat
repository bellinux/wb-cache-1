25|$|The {{public sector}} effort {{continues}} {{with the goal}} to create a high-quality, draft genome sequence from reads generated by all sources. The public-sector effort has generated Sanger reads of BACs, fosmids, and plasmids as well as 454 reads. These later types of reads will be instrumental in assembling an initial draft of the D genome. In 2010, two companies (Monsanto and Illumina), completed enough Illumina sequencing to cover the D genome of G. raimondii about 50x. They announced that they would donate their raw reads to the public. This public relations effort gave them some recognition for sequencing the cotton genome. Once the D genome is assembled {{from all of this}} raw material, it will undoubtedly assist in the assembly of the AD genomes of cultivated varieties of cotton, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hard work remains.|$|E

At this time, her mother finally accepted her studies because of her brilliant work in middle school and was happy with her accomplishments.However, she stayed in this school for only 1 year because of society’s situation. At that period, Japan started some small wars with China and killed many Chinese. A lot of students in this school were angry about that and held many parades to boycott Japan. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Japanese soldiers and spies stayed in China, so the parades were suppressed and some students were killed. Because of this, the study could not continue. So Lanying Lin transferred after one {{year in high school}} to a women’s school called Hami Lton School, which was founded by an American. One of her teachers came from American and could not speak Chinese very well, so many of her classmates could not understand his courses. Lanying helped the teacher as an assistant. So every time the teacher taught something in English, Lanying Lin would help to teach in Chinese. Because of this, she was called ‘little teacher’ by her classmates.|$|E

25|$|In the United States, {{forensic}} entomology became {{well known}} through {{the trial of}} David Westerfield in 2002 for the abduction and murder of seven-year-old Danielle van Dam. In this San Diego case, the courtroom became a battle over conflicting reports from four forensic entomologists: David Faulkner, Neal Haskell, M. Lee Goff, and Robert D. Hall. A fifth scientist, William Rodriguez, a forensic anthropologist, also testified on this issue. Danielle had vanished from her bedroom the night of February 1–2; her partially decomposed body was found February 27. Haskell, Hall, and Faulker argued that forensic entomology established that the body of was dumped in mid-February, during which time Westerfield was already under police surveillance (since February 5), while Goff said the victim's body was colonized by larvae earlier than the other three entomologists estimated (his dates were February 9 to 14). His dates were earlier as he used new data from Canada which gives a significantly slower development for that fly species. Richard Merritt, a forensic entomologist and professor at Michigan State University, stated that because each scientist has his own method, {{this can lead to}} disagreement, <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the disagreements involve a variation of one or two days, not over {{a week and a half}} as in the Westerfield case: “If it's that big a time, someone screwed up”.|$|E

He was annoyed that a number of archaeologists—including surveyor Stewart Ainsworth, small finds specialist Helen Geake and illustrator Victor Ambrus—had seen their roles diminished while a new co-presenter, Mary-Ann Ochota (a former model with a bachelor's degree in archaeology and anthropology), had been introduced, and that as a result the episodes now contained [...] "a lot of faffing about."

500|$|In contrast, the {{narrative}} surrounding Fox has been critiqued as illustrating the media's focus on stereotyped portrayals {{of the heroic}} and extraordinary achievements of people with disabilities, rather than more mundane accomplishments. Actor Alan Toy noted [...] "Sure, it raised money for cancer research and sure it showed the human capacity for achievement. <b>But</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> disabled people are made to feel like failures if they haven't done something extraordinary. They may be bankers or factory workers– proof enough of their usefulness to society. Do {{we have to be}} 'supercrips' in order to be valid? And if we're not super, are we invalid?" [...] The media's idealization of Fox has also been critiqued for emphasizing an individualistic approach to illness and disability, in which the body is a machine to be mastered, rather than the social model of disability, where societal attitudes and barriers to inclusion play a prominent role in determining who is disabled.|$|E

500|$|The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin {{called this}} episode [...] "clumsy and tired", {{explaining}} it was [...] "misfiring on all cylinders.

[...] He continued in his recap that [...] "Let's Stay Together" [...] had a [...] "golden opportunity to comment insightfully and hilariously about the tricky intersection of politics, power, race and privilege", however [...] "it recycled jokes that were unfunny and overly familiar the first time around".

And that's the thing, 'cause it had great jokes but we sort of changed the story and went through a bunch of drafts." [...] The story was completely rewritten and as a result, the plot became odder and quirkier with the scenes of paranoia deriving from this. The original script was [...] "really crazy" [...] <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the more insane material was cut. However, most of the rewrites were done during the script-writing and did not require any major animation changes. One change was the ending, which was added after the animatic. The episode features several pairings of established characters who had previously interacted little, such as Waylon Smithers with Bart and Lisa. Weinstein feels that {{this was one of the}} first episodes to really feature the duo of Lenny Leonard and Carl Carlson and developed them more.|$|E

[...] In terms of her own personal style, Sevigny cited the Australian film Picnic at Hanging Rock (1975), which features schoolgirls dressed in elaborate Victorian clothing, as a major inspiration; she has also cited it as one of her favorite films. She has also been outspoken in her favoritism of vintage clothing over designer pieces: [...] "I still prefer to buy vintage over spending it all on one designer", she told The Times. [...] "I'll go to Resurrection or Decades and be like, 'Oh, I'm going to buy everything,' <b>but</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> it is extremely expensive, so I'll go to Wasteland and satisfy that urge and it's not too hard on the pocketbook.
