50|$|Molar mass {{determination}} of copolymers {{is a much}} more complicated procedure. The complications arise from the effect of solvent on the homopolymers and how this can affect the copolymer morphology. Analysis of copolymers typically requires multiple characterization methods. For instance, copolymers with short chain branching such as linear low-density polyethylene (a copolymer of ethylene and a higher alkene such as hexene or octene) require the use of Analytical Temperature Rising Elution Fractionation (ATREF) techniques. These techniques can reveal how the short chain branches are distributed over the various molecular weights. A more efficient analysis of copolymer molecular mass and composition is possible using GPC combined with a triple-detection system comprising multi-angle light scattering, UV absorption and differential refractometry, if the copolymer is composed of two <b>base</b> <b>polymers</b> that provide different responses to UV and/or refractive index.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: This study {{evaluated}} the shear bond strengths of light-polymerized urethane dimethacrylate (Eclipse) and heat-polymerized polymethylmethacrylate (Meliodent) denture <b>base</b> <b>polymers</b> to intraoral and laboratory-processed reline materials. Materials and Methods: Thirty disks measuring 15 mm diameter and 2 mm thick {{were prepared for}} each denture base material following the manufacturers' recommendation. They were relined with Meliodent RR, Kooliner, and Secure reline materials after 1 month of water immersion. Ten additional Eclipse specimens were relined using the same Eclipse resin. A shear bond test was carried out on an Instron machine at a crosshead speed of 1. 0 mm/min 24 hours after relining. Data were analyzed using two-way and one-way ANOVAs and post hoc Dunnett's T 3 test (p = 0. 05). The nature of failure was analyzed under a stereomicroscope. The effect of dichloromethane adhesive on the two denture polymer surfaces and the failed interfaces of mixed and adhesive failures were analyzed under a SEM (scanning electron microscope). Results: Two-way ANOVA showed {{significant differences in the}} shear bond strength values {{as a function of the}} denture <b>base</b> <b>polymers,</b> reline materials, and their interaction (p < 0. 05). One-way ANOVA showed significant differences in shear bond strength values among denture base-reline combinations (p < 0. 05) except for Meliodent-Kooliner and Eclipse-Meliodent RR relines. Meliodent showed the highest shear bond strength value when relined with Meliodent RR (14. 5 +/- 0. 5 MPa), and Eclipse showed the highest value with Eclipse relining (11. 4 +/- 0. 6 MPa). Meliodent denture base showed adhesive, cohesive, and mixed failure, while all Eclipse showed adhesive failure with various reline materials. Conclusion: The two chemically different denture <b>base</b> <b>polymers</b> showed different shear bond strength values to corresponding reline materials.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A {{multifunctional}} {{epoxy resin}} {{has been demonstrated}} to be an efficient reactive compatibilizer for the incompatible and immiscible blends of polyamide- 6 (PA 6) and polybutylene terephthalate (PBT). The torque measurements give indirect evidence that the reaction between PA and PBT with epoxy {{has an opportunity to}} produce an in situ formed copolymer, which can be as an effective compatibilizer to reduce and suppress the size of the disperse phase, and to greatly enhance mechanical properties of PA/PBT blends. The mechanical property improvement is more pro-nounced in the PA-rich blends than that in the PBT-rich blends. The fracture behavior of the blend with less than 0. 3 phr compatibilizer is governed by a particle pullout mechanism, whereas shear yielding is dominant in the fracture behavior of the blend with more than 0. 3 phr compatibilizer. As the melt and crystallization temperatures of the <b>base</b> <b>polymers</b> are so close, either PA or PBT can be regarded as a mutual nucleating agent to enhance the crystallization on the other component. The presence of compatibilizer and in situ formed copolymer in the compatibilized blends tends to interfere with the crystallization of the <b>base</b> <b>polymers</b> in various blends. © 2000 Joh...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The impact {{strength}} and the flexural properties of denture base materials are of importance in predicting their clinical performance upon sudden loading. This study compares the impact and transverse strengths and the flexural modulus of three denture <b>base</b> <b>polymers.</b> Materials and Methods: The investigation included a relatively new microwave-polymerized polyurethane-based denture material processed by an injection-molding technique, a conventional microwave-polymerized denture material, and a heat-polymerized compression-molded poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) denture material. Impact strength was determined using a Charpy-type impact tester. The transverse {{strength and the}} flexural modulus were assessed with a three-point bending test. The results were subjected to statistical analysis using a {{one-way analysis of variance}} and the Scheffe test for comparison. Results: The {{impact strength}} of the microwave-polymerized injection-molded polymer was 6. 3 kJ/m(2), while its flexural strength was 66. 2 MPa. These values were lower than those shown by the two compression-molded PMMA-based polymers. The differences were statistically significant. The flexural modulus of the new denture material was 2, 832 MPa, which was higher than the conventional heat-polymerized polymer but was comparable to the other microwave-polymerized PMMA-based polymer. The difference in the flexural modulus was statistically significant. Conclusion: In terms of the impact and flexural strengths, the new microwave-polymerized, injection-molded, polyurethane-based polymer offered no advantage over the existing heat- and microwave-polymerized PMMA-based denture <b>base</b> <b>polymers.</b> However, it has a rigidity comparable to that of the m microwave-polymerized PMMA polymer...|$|E
