5|$|On February 5, 2013, Colorado {{representative}} Jared Polis introduced Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013 (H.R. 499; 113th Congress), a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> decriminalize marijuana on {{the federal}} level, instead treating it as a substance to be regulated {{in a similar manner}} to alcohol.

5|$|During Washington's administration, the President {{was given}} broad powers for {{removing}} {{officials in the}} executive branch. Congress passed a bill sponsored by James Madison that gave the President the power to remove public officials whose appointments mandated Senatorial approval. In 1789, Vice President John Adams cast the deciding vote in the Senate against a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have mandated senatorial consent {{for the removal of}} Senate-confirmed federal and cabinet appointments. The bill had been sponsored by Pennsylvania Senator William Maclay.|$|E
5|$|In February 1835, Ohio passed {{legislation}} {{that set up}} county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas, a move that further exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan. Also, during this period, Ohio attempted to use its power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> formally set the state border to be the Harris Line.|$|E
5|$|Ryan opposes {{same-sex}} marriage, {{had previously}} supported a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage, opposed {{the repeal of}} the don't ask, don't tell policy, voted against same-sex couples adopting children in Washington D.C., and voted against a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> expand federal hate crime laws to cover offenses based on a victim's sexual orientation. Unlike most of his fellow Republicans, Ryan voted in favor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in 2007, which would have prohibited employment {{discrimination on the basis of}} sexual orientation.|$|E
50|$|During {{the week}} of November 18, 2013, Republicans in the state {{legislature}} planned to introduce four <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> restrict voting in the 2014 elections, including shortening the early voting period from thirty-five to twenty-nine days.|$|R
5000|$|While in office, {{he headed}} a {{subcommittee}} that drafted legislation founding the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency, and sponsored <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> penalize the state Medicaid system for late payments {{to doctors and}} <b>that</b> <b>would</b> make {{state board of education}} districts coincide with congressional districts.|$|R
50|$|He is {{conservative}} {{on abortion}} issues, which {{earned him a}} 100% rating by the Christian Coalition from 2003 to 2005. He has voted against <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> authorize partial birth abortion, taxpayer-funded human embryo experimentation, and human cloning.|$|R
5|$|The {{most recent}} {{source of income}} from the lands, an {{extension}} of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000, was last renewed in 2013 but at vastly reduced spending levels, leaving some counties scrambling to find new sources of funding. In late 2013, the United States House of Representatives was considering a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> resume the funding and increase timber harvests to provide additional income to the counties.|$|E
5|$|According to a MinnPost poll, Minnesotans {{blamed the}} Republican {{legislature}} {{more for the}} shutdown. Overall, 42% said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible, 21% said the DFL governor was more responsible, and 22% volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame. As expected, partisans blamed the other party more; only 10% of Republicans blamed the legislature more, and only 2% of DFLers blamed Dayton more. Following the shutdown, DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> prevent government shutdowns {{in the event of}} disagreements between the governor and legislature, as she had done in several past sessions. The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department, published in December 2011, that looked into what such a bill would require. The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before, including after the 2005 shutdown, and had been abandoned.|$|E
5|$|After a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have {{provided}} funds {{to protect the}} site failed, then-President Lyndon B. Johnson signed an Executive Order that authorized funding for the Army Corps of Engineers to build a levee around the site {{to protect it from}} the imminent flooding caused by construction of the Lower Monumental Dam. Late that year, Daugherty left the dig, leaving Fryxell to lead the project. Once the Lower Monumental Dam was closed in February 1969, within three days, the site was completely underwater, due to the seepage of thick layers of gravel that had not been accounted for. However, as the site was being flooded, the excavation team laid down plastic sheeting topped with gravel in the hopes of being able to return to the dig in the future.|$|E
50|$|Walker had {{a strong}} pro-life record in the state assembly. With the {{exception}} of some bills while Walker was running for Milwaukee County Executive, Walker either sponsored or cosponsored all but three <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> have restricted abortions.|$|R
5000|$|Believing that {{farm animals}} {{should be treated}} humanely, Matalin teamed up with PETA to produce a video in 2013, {{encouraging}} Indiana lawmakers to vote against [...] "ag-gag" [...] <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> ban unapproved videotaping on farms and businesses.|$|R
50|$|The Contract {{had promised}} to bring to floor debate and votes 10 <b>bills</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{implement}} major reform of the federal government. When the 104th Congress assembled in January 1995, the Republican majority sought to implement the Contract.|$|R
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the {{regulation}} of interstate commerce, especially as concerned the railroads, was a political issue. The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation's business interests, with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers, who were aggrieved by high railroad rates, joining the reformers. Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action. In 1886, Payne voted for a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> reform railroad rates slightly, but was considered ineffective by reformers. After amendments by the House, however, the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious. Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act, which passed and {{was signed into law}} by President Grover Cleveland. In explaining his vote, Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping (such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes) over the railroads.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of Stanley's {{election}} to the House, the American Tobacco Company had eliminated all its substantial competitors either by acquisition or by driving them out of business. The company worked with British tobacco manufacturers to set tobacco prices worldwide. Congressman Stanley came {{to the defense of}} the tobacco farmers of his district, making him virtually unbeatable as a congressional candidate. In the first of his five consecutive terms, he authored a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> remove an oppressive national tobacco tax, hoping this would help raise prices for unprocessed tobacco. The bill was defeated by extensive lobbying efforts by the American Tobacco Company. In 1904, he convinced the Ways and Means Committee to hold public hearings on the American Tobacco Company's monopolistic actions, but the hearings did not convince legislators to repeal the tax nor take action against the American Tobacco Company.|$|E
5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a <b>bill</b> <b>that</b> <b>would</b> {{have allowed}} the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; {{despite the fact that}} the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with the Senate. After the Senate rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed the Senate had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When the Senate rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and the Senate, after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. The Senate finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
