50|$|This {{advancement}} {{was possible}} because many university computer terminals had switched by the mid-1970s to CRT screens, {{which could be}} refreshed with text {{in a few seconds}} instead of a minute or more. Earlier games printed game status for the player on Teletype machines or a line printer, at speeds ranging from 10 to 30 characters per second with a rat-a-tat-tat sound as a metal <b>ball</b> or <b>belt</b> with characters was pressed against paper through an inked ribbon by a hammer.|$|R
30|$|After {{warming up}} and {{applying}} sensors from the proposed system, we had participants hit a teed <b>ball</b> at <b>belt</b> height toward a net {{placed in the}} pitcher’s direction as hard as possible five times. Participants had performed this tee-batting task during the pre-test. Following the pre-test, participants practiced by applying the proposed training program. During training program, training group listened to auditory cue BF, control group didn’t. Lastly, participants performed a tee batting post-test during which the training group listened to auditory cue BF.|$|R
3000|$|We {{asked the}} {{participants}} to swing a 0.55  kg bat {{as if they were}} hitting a <b>ball</b> at <b>belt</b> height in the pitcher’s direction ten times. We chose these parameters because previous studies found that swing form is affected by ball speed [22], whether a pitch is a breaking ball [23], ball height [24, 25], direction the ball is to be hit [26], and the weight of the bat [27]. We then captured acceleration data, which we used to verify the validity of the system’s judgment (i.e., difference between skilled and novice). We also calculated the time at which the relative exercise intensity (R [...]...|$|R
50|$|As a child, Conan must attend Teitan Elementary, {{where he}} {{inadvertently}} forms a detective club called the Junior Detective League with friends he makes at the school. Conan {{is forced to}} adapt to his new daily life and becomes accustomed to attending elementary school while secretly helping Richard solve crimes {{with the use of}} his gadgets invented by Dr. Agasa. The most prominent of these are: his voice-changing bowtie, allowing him to impersonate anyone's voice; his customized glasses which allow him to track and listen through his covert listening devices; his super sneakers which multiply his kicking force; his wrist watch stun gun, which allows him to tranquilize Richard or a criminal; his Solar Powered skateboard as well as a soccer <b>ball</b> dispenser <b>belt,</b> super strong/elastic suspenders, among others.|$|R
5000|$|Upon release, Ian Templeton of Record Collector {{reviewed}} the DVD and stated: [...] "On a gorgeous sunny day, the set starts with Harley's well-known classic, [...] "Here Comes the Sun". The band are clearly having a <b>ball</b> and <b>belt</b> {{it out for}} all their worth. Certain elements of the crowd are clearly waiting for The Who, but Harley's pretty successful in winning over most punters. The 50-minute set ends with the obligatory [...] "Make Me Smile". The 'extras' are reasonably interesting. The common theme the interviews being what a thoroughly nice guy Mr Harley is. There's also a stand-alone interview with the man himself and a live rendition of the 10-minute-long [...] "Death Trip". Bit of a dirge if you ask me, but the fans seem to love it." ...|$|R
50|$|Since {{dovetail}} slides {{have such}} a large surface contact area, a greater force is required to move the saddle than other linear slides, which results in slower acceleration rates. Additionally, dovetail slides have difficulties with high-friction but are advantageous {{when it comes to}} load capacity, affordability and durability. Capable of long travel, dovetail slides are more resistant to shock than other bearings, and they are mostly immune to chemical, dust and dirt contamination. Dovetail slides can be motorized, mechanical or electromechanical. Electric dovetail slides are driven by a number of different devices, such as <b>ball</b> screws, <b>belts</b> and cables, which are powered by functional motors such as stepper motors, linear motors and handwheels. Dovetail slides are direct contact systems, making them fitting for heavy load applications including CNC machines, shuttle devices, special machines and work holding devices. Mainly used in the manufacturing and laboratory science industries, dovetail slides are ideal for high-precision applications.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{varieties}} {{of this game}} was broadly cultivated in Azerbaijan. Here two teams strive for scoring a goal with special clubs. Rules in the modern edition of the game are the following: two goals with a width of 3 meters with semi-circled areas with a radius of 6 meters are fixed in an enough big area. The game was held with a rubber or woven from leather <b>belts</b> <b>ball.</b> Clubs can be different in forms. In Azerbaijani horsemen they remind of shepherd’s yarlyg. There are 6 riders in each team, 4 of whom act as attackers and two as fullbacks. The latter can play only on their half of the area. Goals can be scored behind the borders of penalty area. Duration {{of the game is}} 30 minutes in two periods. [...] Traditionally Karabakh horses are the mount of choice thanks to their combination of agility and relatively calm temperament.|$|R
50|$|Ponting won the toss {{and elected}} to bat. Hayden {{returned}} from injury to open, {{he was the}} first to fall, holing Amerasinghe straight to cover, after a 64 run opening partnership from 79 balls. Ponting edged Vaas to first slip to be out for just 9 runs. Clarke then combined with Gilchrist, who scored a half century before being trapped LBW by Kapugedera. Symonds smashed straight to cover and was taken off Vaas, then Hussey hit straight to point and was also caught. However the wickets only came slowly with Australia at 5-190 after 41.4 overs. Clarke and Hopes finished the innings well after it looked like Australia could stumble to a lower score. Clarke finished not out on 77 from 86 <b>balls,</b> while Hopes <b>belted</b> 34 from 29 balls to help boost Australia to 6/253 from the full 50 overs. Vaas was the best bowler with 2/34 from 10 overs, Amerasinghe also took 2 wickets, but for 66 runs. Australia played tight against Muralitharan, who ended on up 0/42, he was later injured in the field when a ball bounced off his hands and smashed into his teeth.|$|R
40|$|Most {{advanced}} manufacturing processes require highspeed and high precision motion control for material transfer, packaging, assembly, and electrical wiring. Examples are surface mounting of electronic components, wire bonding of semiconductor chips, and assembly of watches and hard disks. To achieve precise motion control, {{most of these}} high-performance manufacturing machines use rotary d. c. or a. c. motors as the prime motion actuator, and couple their output shafts to mechanical motion translators (e. g. reduction gear, <b>belt,</b> <b>ball</b> screw, etc.). Though {{this is the most}} widely used method, it has disadvantages of reduced accuracy, complex mechanical structure, difficult adjustments and alignments, high production cost, and low reliability. in this paper, the author proposes a new direction in high performance machine design, and suggests that future high performance motion systems should be designed through "simplifying the mechanics through specialized direct-drive actuators and advanced control methodologies". For this purpose, this paper investigates a class of variable reluctance (VR) direct-drive motion actuators for high performance machines. The paper looks into several specialized motion actuator systems designed by the author, (including limited stroke actuator, gripper, artificial limb, linear motion device, and planar motion device), highlights their features and advantages, and describes the challenges of controlling these devices.
