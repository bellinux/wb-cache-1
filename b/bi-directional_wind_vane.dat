40|$|A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Met One Instruments, Incorporated (Met One) and Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC) {{was created}} {{to develop a new}} wind vane that more {{accurately}} measures atmospheric turbulence. Through a process that had several phases, Met One created a prototype vane that was designed to attach to the existing Model 1585 <b>Bi-Directional</b> <b>Wind</b> <b>Vane</b> instrument structure. The prototype contained over 20 % less mass to enhance responsiveness, which was also increased {{through the use of a}} teardrop-shaped fin structure. The prototype vane can be readily manufactured for commercial retail. Tests in wind tunnel of Building 735 - 7 A, the Meteorological Engineering Facility, indicated that the new vane has a superior starting threshold of less than 0. 14 meter per second, a delay distance of 0. 72 meter, and a damping ratio of 0. 4. The relative accuracy of less than one degree is unchanged from the previous design. The vane bias was acceptable at 0. 8 degree for the horizontal wind angle, but was slightly high at 1. 4 degree for the verticle wind angle. The high value of the verticle wind angle bias can most likely be reduced to the desired less than one degree value with standard manufacturing production techniques. The durability of the prototype vane was not tested in the field but is expected to be slightly less due to the use of hollow rather than foam-filled fins. However, the loss of some durability is more than compensated with increased sensitivity at low wind speeds. Field testing of the prototype is required to test for adequacy of durability...|$|E

40|$|A Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Met One Instruments, Incorporated (Met One) and Westinghouse Savannah River Company (WSRC) {{was made}} to develop and test a fiber optic measurement-based <b>wind</b> <b>vane.</b> Some {{advantages}} of using fiber optic technology for a <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> include protection against lightning-induced electrical surges and radio-frequency interference, suitability for use in explosive environments, and a longer field life. A prototype fiber optic <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> was built by Met One and tested by WSRC. Wind tunnel test {{results indicated that the}} vane is very sensitive to low wind speeds (< 0. 15 meter per second) although the resolution of the sensor (1. 4 degrees) is higher than typical <b>wind</b> <b>vanes.</b> A side-by-side field test with a conventional commercial <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> indicated that the fiber optic <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> performed well and even outperformed the conventional sensor during low wind speed conditions. The field test also indicated that the fiber optic sensor is a viable instrument although some modifications are required before the sensor can be readily commercialized...|$|R

50|$|A {{majority}} of older automated airport weather stations {{are equipped with}} a mechanical <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> and cup system to measure wind speed and direction. This system is simple in design: the wind spins three horizontally turned cups {{around the base of}} the <b>wind</b> <b>vane,</b> providing an estimation of the wind's speed, while the vane on top turns so that the face of the vane offers the least resistance to the wind, causing it to point in the direction the wind is coming from and thus providing the wind direction.|$|R

50|$|The MN-111 is a Polish air-dropped {{anti-tank}} landmine. The mine {{is designed}} for use on soft ground. The mine is cylindrical with six spring-loaded fins attached to {{one end of the}} mine, with the cylinder drawn to a point at the opposite end which is topped with a small <b>wind</b> <b>vane.</b> The mine is stored with the fins wrapped round the outside of the mine. Once the mine is dropped from the aircraft the fins spring outward, acting as a drag parachute, slowing the rate of descent to a peak speed of about 60 meters per second. As the mine drops the <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> spins, generating the power used to arm the mine.|$|R
50|$|Modern servo {{pendulum}} self-steering devices with optimized {{transmission and}} low friction mechanics {{are more and}} more used for day sailing and cruising; formerly being used mainly for long distance ocean passages. The increased low wind capabilities of optimized, modern devices enable downwind steering down to 1.3 m/s apparent wind and 1.5 kn of boat speed - properties that make an electronic steering device nearly redundant and enable crossing the doldrums under <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> self-steering. An increasing number of long distance regatta sailors are using <b>wind</b> <b>vane</b> self-steering because of the fact, that the sails are always kept in optimal angle towards the wind, and hence the speed of the boat is kept at the possible maximum.|$|R
5000|$|Modern {{instruments}} used {{to measure}} wind speed and direction are called anemometers and <b>wind</b> <b>vanes,</b> respectively.
