5|$|The {{turkey vulture}} (Cathartes aura), also known in some North American regions as the turkey <b>buzzard</b> (or just <b>buzzard),</b> {{and in some}} areas of the Caribbean as the John crow or carrion crow, is the most {{widespread}} of the New World vultures. One of three species in the genus Cathartes of the family Cathartidae, the turkey vulture ranges from southern Canada to the southernmost tip of South America. It inhabits a variety of open and semi-open areas, including subtropical forests, shrublands, pastures, and deserts.|$|E

5|$|On July 25, 2013, a {{tentative}} deal was announced which {{will see a}} 20,000-25,000 seat stadium built at <b>Buzzard</b> Point costing $300 million. Following votes by the D.C. Council to approve the plan, it {{was signed into law}} on December 30, 2014. Under the July 2013 deal, the District of Columbia was to have obtained a portion of the necessary <b>Buzzard</b> Point property from the developer that owned it, in exchange for cash and a government building. D.C. United would kick the $150 million needed to construct the stadium on the city-owned land, which it would rent for 20 to 35 years. Under the deal as revised by D.C. City Council in December 2014, the city would instead pay fair market value for the developer's land, and use eminent domain if a deal could not be reached.|$|E

5|$|Earp {{was named}} deputy sheriff {{in the area}} {{including}} newly incorporated Kootenai County, Idaho, which was disputing jurisdiction of Eagle City with Shoshone County. There were {{a considerable number of}} disagreements over mining claims and property rights, which Earp had a part in. On March 28, several feet of snow were still on the ground. Bill <b>Buzzard,</b> a miner of dubious reputation, began constructing a building when one of Wyatt's partners, Jack Enright, tried to stop the construction. Enright claimed the building was on part of his property. Words were exchanged and <b>Buzzard</b> reached for his Winchester. He fired several shots at Enright and a skirmish developed. Allies of both sides quickly took defensive positions between snowbanks and began shooting at one another. Deputy Sheriff Wyatt Earp and his brother James stepped {{into the middle of the}} fray and helped peacefully resolve the dispute before anyone was seriously hurt. Shoshone County Deputy W. E. Hunt then arrived and ordered the parties to turn over their weapons.|$|E

5|$|The Rolls-Royce R was a British {{aero engine}} {{designed}} and built specifically for air racing purposes by Rolls-Royce Limited. Nineteen R engines were assembled in a limited production run between 1929 and 1931. Developed from the Rolls-Royce <b>Buzzard,</b> it was a 37-litre (2,240cu in) capacity, supercharged V-12 capable of producing just under 2,800horsepower (2,090kW), and weighed 1,640pounds (770kg). Intensive factory testing revealed mechanical failures which were remedied by redesigning the components, greatly improving reliability.|$|E
5|$|The bird life is {{dominated}} by species from the Siberian taiga, which are otherwise not common in Norway. Species inhabiting the park include Siberian jay, pine grosbeak, Bohemian waxwing, common crane and whooper swan. Several species of sparrow and charadriiformes are also common. There are also three species of Falconiformes—rough-legged <b>buzzard,</b> merlin and osprey, the latter which can be seen hunting over Ellenvatn and Ødevatn. The great grey owl and northern hawk-owl are common in years with good access to rodents.|$|E
5|$|The {{great grey shrike}} is able {{to detect}} flying {{bumblebees}} up to 100 metres away; once captured, the sting is removed by repeatedly squeezing the insect with the mandibles and wiping the abdomen on a branch.

The eggs and chicks may be targeted by cats and corvids, although the adults are fearless in defence of their nests, occasionally even attacking humans. The mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite.|$|E
5|$|Wildlife abounds in the valley, {{particularly}} the water birds around {{the rivers and}} lakes, with Chew Valley Lake considered the third most important site in Britain for wintering wildfowl. In addition to the water birds including ducks, shoveller (Anas clypeata), gadwall (Anas strepera) and great crested grebes (Podiceps cristatus), {{a wide variety of}} other bird species can be seen. These range from small birds such as tits (Paridae) and wrens (Troglodytidae) to mistle thrush (Turdidae). Larger birds include woodpeckers (Picidae) and common <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo buteo).|$|E
5|$|A {{variety of}} water birds {{can be seen}} around the lake including: great crested grebe (Podiceps cristatus) and little grebe (Tachybaptus ruficollis), {{cormorant}} (Phalacrocoracidae), mute swan (Cygnus olor), Canada goose (Branta canadensis), duck (Anatidae), shoveller (Anas clypeata) and gadwall (Anas strepera). The common <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo buteo) {{can be seen on}} the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus) and kestrel breed. Occasional visitors include: osprey ("Pandion haeliatis"), goshawk (Accipiter gentilis), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo), nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker (Dendrocopos major). The ruddy darter dragonfly (Sympetrum sanguineum) can also be seen. In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers, roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) and foxes.|$|E

5|$|Fork-marked lemurs {{are thought}} to be preyed upon by large owls, such as the Madagascar owl (Asio madagascariensis), and snakes like the Malagasy tree boa (Sanzinia madagascariensis). In one case, a family of fork-marked lemurs {{exhibited}} mobbing behavior when they encountered a Malagasy tree boa. Diurnal raptors, such as the Madagascar <b>buzzard</b> (Buteo brachypterus) and Madagascar cuckoo-hawk (Aviceda madagascariensis) hunt these lemurs at dusk, and the hunting behavior of the Madagascar harrier-hawk (Polyboroides radiatus) suggests it might extract them from their sleeping holes. The fossa (Cryptoprocta ferox) has also been seen attacking fork-marked lemurs, and remains have been found in their scat.|$|E
5|$|More than 300 {{bird species}} have been {{recorded}} in the area, making Hengistbury Head an important migratory point.

Other rare birds spotted here include the purple heron, the pink-footed goose, the European honey <b>buzzard</b> and the melodious warbler. The fields and reserved areas near the car park provide an ideal spot to watch and listen to a significant population of skylarks during the summer months.|$|E
5|$|On {{an early}} test run the R engine {{produced}} 1,400hp (1,040kW) and was noted to idle happily at 450revolutions per minute (rpm). With increased boost ratings and fuel developed by Banks, the R engine ultimately developed 2,530hp (1,890kW) at 3,200rpm; well over double the maximum power {{output of the}} <b>Buzzard.</b> The engine was further tested and cleared for limited sprint racing at 2,783hp (2,075kW) at 3,400rpm and +21lb (1.45bar) of boost, but this capability was not used due to concerns with the S.6B's airframe {{not being able to}} withstand the power, and the inability of the aircraft to lift the extra fuel required to meet the increased consumption.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} compare the two species’ flight {{performance}} over the exposed and windy Falsterbo Peninsula, where thermal conditions seldomly are very favorable, we used tracking radar to study flight parameters of sparrowhawks Accipiter nisus and common <b>buzzards</b> Buteo buteo during autumn migration. The results showed a clear difference between sparrowhawks and common <b>buzzards</b> in their flight altitudes and speeds, and in the wind conditions they encountered. Common <b>buzzards</b> had higher flight altitudes and were more selective of wind. Flight altitude was negatively related to the wind speed, which was most pronounced for common <b>buzzards.</b> Sparrowhawks had higher mean air- and cross-country speeds than common <b>buzzards.</b> Airspeed was negatively related, whereas ground and cross-country speeds were positively related to the tailwind component for both raptors. The differences between sparrowhawks and <b>buzzards</b> could {{to a large degree}} be explained by a larger dependence on thermal soaring among the common buzzards; a strategy associated with selectivity for favourable thermal and wind conditions during migratory flight. An additional important explanation for the interspecific differences was the habit of the sparrowhawks to combine migratory flight with hunting for prey, which makes it prone to fly at lower altitudes and use flapping flight to a much larger degree than common <b>buzzards</b> which do not forage during their migratory passage of the Falsterbo Peninsula...|$|R

As he tries to crawl through the opening, Glory hits him and tries to bash his head in with a rock. He is able to get her to trust him by informing her that he was sent by her mother to rescue her. She then guides him to a dark room where the <b>Buzzards</b> breed moths for food. Hearing voices of footsteps, he lights a flare and sees that a group of <b>Buzzards</b> has discovered them. He fights and defeats them all. He is then guided by Glory to the place where she was hiding since the <b>Buzzards</b> have never discovered it. She tells that they could climb out {{through a hole in the}} ceiling but Max refuses since he wants to take back the Interceptor. He notices that one of the doors in her hiding place leads to the car parking area and asks Glory about it. She informs him it is too dangerous to go there since the <b>Buzzards</b> live there. A group of <b>Buzzards</b> discover the hiding place and chases them both.|$|R
