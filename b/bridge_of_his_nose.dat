500|$|The first {{character}} Nomura {{designed for}} Final Fantasy VIII, Squall {{was inspired by}} actor River Phoenix, although Nomura said that [...] "obody understood it." [...] Squall is [...] tall, initially with longer hair and a more feminine appearance. After objections by game director Yoshinori Kitase, Nomura made the character more masculine. He added the scar across Squall's brow and the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> impulsively (to make the character more recognizable), leaving the description of its origin up to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall's first illustration {{was used as a}} set up to create the world around him. The logo of the game which had Squall embracing Rinoa was left as an open interpretation for fans who still had not played the game. The scar in Squall's forehead was also left ambiguous although Nomura said it was important for him.|$|E
500|$|Kitase {{expressed}} a desire to give the game a foreign atmosphere ("foreign" [...] being in relation to Japan); his objective with the environment was to create a largely European setting. The first character Nomura designed specifically for use in Final Fantasy VIII was Squall, initially giving him longer hair and a more feminine appearance. However, Yoshinori Kitase did not feel that this design worked and asked Nomura to shorten his hair and make him look more masculine, which led to the design seen in-game. When designing Cloud Strife, Nomura gave him distinctly spiky, bright blonde hair to emphasize his role as that game's protagonist. With Squall, Nomura wanted to try a unique angle to establish his role, giving him the characteristic gunblade scar across the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> A complete history was not yet conceived, so Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to Nojima. Squall's design was flourished by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, included for the purpose of challenging the game's full motion video designers. This is but one example of the demands he has consistently extended to the programmers of the Final Fantasy series as technology has advanced.|$|E

500|$|To {{maintain}} a foreign atmosphere, {{the characters of}} the game were designed to have predominantly European appearances. The first Final Fantasy VIII character created was Squall. Desiring to add a unique angle to Squall's appearance and emphasize {{his role as the}} central character, Nomura gave him a scar across his brow and the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose.</b> As there was not yet a detailed history conceived for the character, Nomura left the explanation for Squall's scar to scenario writer Kazushige Nojima. Squall was given a gunblade, a fictional revolverâ€“sword hybrid that functions primarily as a sword, with an added damaging vibration feature activated by use of its gun mechanism, similar to a vibroblade. His character design was complemented by a fur lining along the collar of his jacket, incorporated by Nomura as a challenge for the game's full motion video designers. Additionally, some designs Nomura had previously drawn, but had not yet used in a Final Fantasy game, were incorporated into Final Fantasy VIII. These were the designs of Edea, Fujin and Raijin. The latter two had originally been designed for use in Final Fantasy VII, but with the inclusion of the Turks characters in that game, it was felt that Fujin and Raijin were unnecessary. Nomura had designed Edea before the development of Final Fantasy VII, based on the style of Yoshitaka Amano. For the Guardian Forces, Nomura felt they should be unique beings, without clothes or other human-like concepts. This was problematic, as he did not want them to [...] "become the actual monsters", so he took great care in their design. Leviathan was the first GF, created as a test and included in a game demo. After it received a positive reaction from players, Nomura decided to create the remaining sequences in a similar fashion.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{descriptions}} {{said that}} Siegel {{was shot in}} the eye, he was actually hit twice {{on the right side of}} his head. The death scene and postmortem photographs show that one shot penetrated his right cheek and exited through the left side of his neck; the other struck the right <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> where it met the right eye socket. The pressure created by the bullet passing through Siegel's skull blew his left eye out of its socket. A Los Angeles' Coroner's Report (#37448) states the cause of death as cerebral hemorrhage. His death certificate (Registrar's #816192) states the manner of death as a homicide and the cause as [...] "Gunshot Wounds of the head." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "There's Andrew Gamble, the Irish champion," [...] said he. [...] "It was 'e {{that beat}} Noah James, the Guardsman, and was {{afterwards}} nearly killed by Jem Belcher, in the 'ollow of Wimbledon Common by Abbershaw's gibbet. The two that are next 'im are Irish also, Jack O'Donnell and Bill Ryan. When {{you get a}} good Irishman you can't better 'em, but they're dreadful 'asty. That little cove with the leery face is Caleb Baldwin the Coster, 'im that they call the Pride of Westminster. 'E's but five foot seven, and nine stone five, but 'e's got the 'eart of a giant. 'E's never been beat, and there ain't a man within a stone of 'im that could beat 'im, except only Dutch Sam. There's George Maddox, too, another o' the same breed, and as good a man as ever pulled his coat off. The genelmanly man that eats with a fork, 'im what looks like a Corinthian, only that the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>'is</b> <b>nose</b> ain't quite as it ought to be, that's Dick 'Umphries, the same that was cock of the middle-weights until Mendoza cut his comb for 'im. You see the other with the grey 'ead and the scars on his face?" ...|$|R
60|$|The monkey-faced polypus replied not a word, but {{delivered}} a right-hander {{that might have}} felled a small horse. Jim Slagg however was prepared for that. He turned his head neatly to one side so as to let the blow pass, {{and at the same}} moment planted his knuckles on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> opponent's <b>nose</b> and sent him headlong into Jeff's bunk, which lay conveniently behind. Jumping furiously out of that, and skinning his shins in the act, Stumps rushed at Slagg, who, leaping lightly aside, tripped him up and gave him a smack on the left ear as he passed, by way of keeping him lively.|$|R
60|$|He was mortally {{jealous of}} me, and persisted in barking at me. She took {{him up in}} her arms--oh my goodness!--and caressed him, but he persisted upon barking still. He wouldn't let me touch him, when I tried; and then she beat him. It {{increased}} my sufferings greatly to see the pats she gave him for punishment on the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> blunt <b>nose,</b> while he winked his eyes, and licked her hand, and still growled within himself like a little double-bass. At length he was quiet--well he might be with her dimpled chin upon his head!--and we walked away {{to look at a}} greenhouse.|$|R

60|$|Knowing that {{he would}} gain his end more quickly by giving in, Jeff {{submitted}} to have several fingers of both hands done up with pieces of white rag, and a slight cut across the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> handsome <b>nose</b> ornamented with black sticking-plaster. He not only enjoyed the operation {{with a sort of}} reckless joviality, but sought to gratify his friend by encouraging her to use her appliances to the utmost, intending to remove them all when he quitted the cottage. The earnest little woman availed herself fully of the encouragement, but could scarcely refrain from laughing when she surveyed him after the operation was completed.|$|R
60|$|Then, it {{was time}} to fire a gun, for a pilot; and almost before its smoke had cleared away, a little boat with a light at her {{masthead}} came bearing down upon us, through the darkness, swiftly. And presently, our sails being backed, she ran alongside; and the hoarse pilot, wrapped and muffled in pea-coats and shawls to the very <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> weather-ploughed-up <b>nose,</b> stood bodily among us on the deck. And I think if that pilot had wanted to borrow fifty pounds for an indefinite period on no security, we should have engaged to lend it to him, among us, before his boat had dropped astern, or (which is the same thing) before every scrap of news in the paper he brought with him had become the common property of all on board.|$|R
6000|$|To {{those who}} know the outward types <b>of</b> <b>his</b> race {{there could be no}} [...] doubt that Anton Trendellsohn was a very Jew among Jews.

He was slightly made, below the middle height, but was [...] well made in every limb, with small feet and hands, and small [...] ears, and a well-turned neck.

Anton Trendellsohn was decidedly a [...] handsome man; but his eyes were somewhat too close together in his [...] face, and the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> aquiline <b>nose</b> was not sharply cut, as [...] is mostly the case with such a nose on a Christian face.

'Pay {{attention}} to the reply, constable, will you?' said the doctor, shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the <b>bridge</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>nose</b> with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy's utmost acuteness.
