Generally, the parallel operation of main transformer offers a number of advantages. However, when a fault occurred in the parallel operation of main transformer, the fault currents could exceed the capacity of conventional protective device and might generate protective coordination problems. To solve these problems, the SFCL has been studied as the attractive device. Especially, in power distribution system on <b>bus</b> <b>tie</b> with SFCL, {{the effect of the}} resistance of SFCL could decrease the increased fault currents and could meet the capacity of conventional protective devices by them. Also, they could solve the protective coordination problems. Therefore, we {{analyzed the}} practical impedance of SFCL on <b>bus</b> <b>tie</b> in a power distribution system using PSCAD/EMTDC...|$|R

Drawing from cross-border social ties literature, the objective {{of this study is to}} assess how cross-border social ties influence use of family planning and institutional deliveries among internal migrant women in India. Cross-sectional data come from 711 migrant women living in slums in Uttar Pradesh, India. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess odds of modern use of family planning and odds of institutional deliveries with cross-border <b>tie</b> <b>indicators.</b> Results suggest that higher cross-border ties were associated with 2. 35 times higher odds of family planning use (p< 0. 1) and 2. 73 times higher odds of institutional delivery (p< 0. 05). This study suggests that social ties to hometowns may serve as a protective factor, possibly through increased social support, to migrants in regards to reproductive decision-making and use of reproductive health services.

40|$|A photo-voltaic system {{consists}} of solar cells, power converters, battery and the load. The power converter interfaces the solar cells, battery and the load. The battery serves to equalise the energy demand (load) {{and the energy}} supply (solar cell). Currently the solar cells and the battery cost nearly 90 % of the system cost. A typical photo-voltaic system can adopt various power <b>bus</b> configurations. Battery <b>tied</b> <b>bus</b> is the simplest of the power bus configurations. In this topology, the battery is always attached to the bus. This system is extremely simple in terms of power circuit configuration as well as control. Such systems weigh less and are more reliable. However, the battery <b>tied</b> <b>bus</b> suffers certain disadvantages. The first {{among them is the}} poor utilisation of solar panels. The load has to tolerate the full swing of the battery voltage variation. On account of the constraint on the solar panel voltage, the solar panels may not be loaded to the maximum power capacity. Such operating conditions lead to gross under-utilisation of the expensive solar panels. The battery <b>tied</b> <b>bus</b> configuration is designed, built and evaluated experimentally with 4 solar panels rated at 35 W each and a lead acid battery of 12 V 42 AH rating. This thesis explores alternate power architecture to overcome the above limitations. Load regulation and maximum power harvesting from the solar panels are the objectives. In the proposed configuration, a bidirectional power converter is inserted between the bus and the battery. The bidirectional power converter operates in boost mode and charges the battery when the sunlight is available. During eclipse period, it operates in buck mode and meets the load demand. The maximum power is extracted from the panels by controlling the voltage across the solar panels. The bus voltage reference is computed by MPPT block and the bus voltage is regulated to the reference voltage through closed loop control. So the maximum power is extracted from the panels at the expense of extra bidirectional power converter. Even though there is an additional power loss due to the introduction of power converter, this power bus configuration is superior because it increases the output power from the panel itself. The entire control logic implementation is done digitally using dspic 30 F 6010 A. The simulation is done by writing script files in C language. The proposed bus configuration is designed, built and evaluated experimentally with the same setup and the results are then compared...|$|R

In contrast, cheap signals can disrupt intrastate negotiations, which makes conflict more likely by increasing the likelihood that one of the competing parties will make exces-sive demands. This argument is tested using measures for sanctions, troop mobilization, alliances, and trade <b>ties</b> as <b>indicators</b> for costly signals, as well as events data as measures for cheap signals.

Previous studies have documented the importance of personality traits, class attendance, and social network structure. However, because most of these analyses were based on a single behavioral aspect and/or small sample sizes, we lack a quantification of the interplay of these factors. Here, we infer the academic performance among a cohort of almost 1, 000 freshmen based on data collected through smartphones, which the students used as their primary phone for two years. The availability of multi-channel data from a single population allows us to directly compare the predictive power of individual and social characteristics.

A key sub-study on the relevance and usability of such indicators was carried out through an action research process with a CSO and it was found that: (1) it was, indeed, possible to develop useful and relevant indicators {{for the presence of}} CSO values; (2) it was not useful to <b>tie</b> each <b>indicator</b> to only one value; (3) the indicators were more ‘universal’ than the values for which they had been derived; (4) these indicators were not considered valid by the user CSO without being ‘localised’ (5) the use of our values-based framework caused substantive transformational learning within this CSO. The importance of these findings to studies on values and to design issues central to formal values-based measurement work, such as face validity and catalytic validity, is drawn out.

The media was used as a means of supporting students in their transition from their respective Further Education (FE) colleges to their ‘on campus’ University (HE) year. The transition involved students moving between institutions to study in a new location and in new peer groups which had historically contributed to dips in confidence and performance and sometimes led to students withdrawing from the programme. The open access, online network (NING) was introduced to allow students to engage with learning activities as a stimulus for online discussion and dialogue with each other through a series of non-assessed ‘blog’ postings (Olofsson, 2007; Dawson 2008; Knight & Rochan 2012). Its purpose was to encourage both the students and the teacher to share their ideas and views and begin ‘talking’ and ‘listening’ (Crawford 2009) to each other prior to meeting in the new term. Noddings (1984), Garrison (1997) and Pring (2004) recognise the importance of strengthening positive relationships between students and teacher and advocate that this is an essential element towards fostering conditions for learning and building a sense of community face to face just as Olofsson (2007) and Yang (2009) noted about online learning. It also aimed to address Oloffsson’s (2007) suggestion for the design of online communities in the 21 st century, that any pedagogical approach to online learning must rely on the ‘…social and collaborative and ethical aspects of learning {{as a starting point for}} design’ (pg 28).

40|$|By {{measuring}} {{the extent to}} which improved economic relations between China and Taiwan has led to improved political relations, this project uses the case of cross-Strait relations to test the idea that economic interdependence encourages peace. Trade <b>ties</b> and <b>indicators</b> of political relations measure {{the extent to which}} economic interdependence can encourage peace and work toward conflict resolution in an inherently conflictual relationship. Economic interdependence expands contacts between states, encourages the building of cooperative institutions, and introduces new incentives for peace over conflict. This paper argues that economic interdependence is not sufficient to resolve political conflict, but it builds an environment conducive to improved political relations and easing of tensions. These improvements are not high-level, political, diplomatic ties but rather the building of lower level political and societal exchange. Trade relations have grown between China and Taiwan from 2003 and 2011, and this economic interdependence is correlated with expanded interaction in tourism, transportation, political dialogue and cultural exchange. These effects allow for greater mutual understanding and contact, which create a reciprocal effect by contributing to increased economic interaction. While progress in cross-Strait relations is constrained by the internal politics of both China and Taiwan at any moment, the United States {{plays an important role in}} reinforcing the positive effects of economic interdependence.
