50|$|Notable {{improvements}} to the original Rzeppa design have been {{the elimination of the}} need for a splined coupling and <b>Birfield's</b> modifications to the ball grooves and their track-steered ball cage introduced with BMC's Minis in 1959.|$|R
50|$|GKN bought <b>Birfield</b> and its {{subsidiaries}} Hardy Spicer and Laycock in 1966. Within GKN Laycock retained {{an individual}} identity until the mid-1970s.|$|E
50|$|The Hardy Spicer and Laycock Engineering {{group of}} businesses, later known as <b>Birfield,</b> {{have been part}} of the GKN Driveline group since 1966.|$|E
5000|$|Dana acquires {{axle group}} of GKN Driveline UK (<b>Birfield</b> / Hardy Spicer) in {{exchange}} for part of joint ventures in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia.|$|E
50|$|In 1939 Hardy-Spicer {{joined with}} Laycock Engineering both {{becoming}} subsidiaries {{of a new}} holding company named <b>Birfield</b> Industries Limited incorporated by Laycock Engineering's chairman, Herbert Hill (1901-1987) for that purpose.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 <b>Birfield,</b> with Laycock and Hardy Spicer, {{were bought}} by the GKN group which was {{entering}} the automotive components field following government's announcement of the intended nationalisation of its GKN Steel.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 Guest Keen & Nettlefold seeing {{advantage}} in amalgamating with its local competition {{and wanting to}} pre-empt an expected bid from USA's TRW Inc. bought <b>Birfield</b> the sole UK supplier of CVJs.|$|E
50|$|Herbert Hill led <b>Birfield</b> {{to develop}} the {{constant}} velocity joint breakthrough which permitted reliable front wheel drive {{and led to the}} development of the Mini and the subsequent popularity of front wheel drive cars. He retired in 1961 but remained a member of the board.|$|E
50|$|Overseas interests: 37.5 {{per cent}} of Uni-Cardan AG, 21 per cent of France's Glaenzer-Spicer SA {{in any case}} {{controlled}} by Uni-Cardan, <b>Birfield</b> Transmissioni SpA in Italy jointly owned with Glaenzer-Spicer, an association with Toyo Bearing of Japan and lesser interests in businesses in many other industrialised countries.|$|E
50|$|Herbert Hill {{pushed his}} team to make {{continuous}} improvements to the basic Rzeppa constant velocity joint and was rewarded in the 1960s when much of the world's motor industry switched to front wheel drive using <b>Birfield</b> joints, the CV joints now made by GKN Driveline and currently installed in {{more than one-third of}} all new cars worldwide.|$|E
50|$|In 1936, when Laycock had 700 employees, an {{agreement}} was reached between Thos W Ward and an investment trust led by Herbert Hill to buy Laycock. At the end of 1938 Laycock chairman Herbert Hill (1901-1987) then arranged that Laycock should be sold to a new owner named <b>Birfield</b> Engineering which would also buy Hardy Spicer.|$|E
50|$|After Laycock died in 1916 the {{business}} {{passed through the}} hands of Charron, a French automobile manufacturer, into receivership from where it was bought by Sheffield engineer and shipbreaker Thos W Ward. Laycock was bought from Ward {{by a group of}} investors and put into the ownership of a new holding company, <b>Birfield</b> Limited, along with Hardy Spicer. Both Laycock and Hardy Spicer made transmission or driveline components for the automotive industry.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the hall {{had a number}} of owners and in 1925 the estate of over 1500 acre was broken up. The hall was sold to Harry Scribbans with only 118 acre and the {{remaining}} land was sold at auction piecemeal. Unoccupied from 1950, the house became the Midlands regional headquarters of Esso in 1954, later the Head Office of <b>Birfield</b> Ltd. In 1966 it was acquired by GKN.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 {{after being}} advised GKN Steel would be nationalised {{for the second}} time GKN bought CVJ market leaders <b>Birfield</b> Industries with its {{subsidiaries}} Hardy Spicer and Laycock Engineering with their interests and subsidiaries in Europe, Japan and USA to save its BRD subsidiary. It was the start of the company's Globalization. GKN establish a manufacturing presence in China in 1988. At the same time GKN Driveline was investing in and growing its business in India, Brazil and Mexico.|$|E
5000|$|Campbell was a {{descendant}} of the Campbells of Barbreck, {{a branch of the}} Argyll family, and the eldest son of Donald Campbell of Barbreck. He was born on 4 January 1782; and entering the army became captain in the 1st regiment of guards. Some time after succeeding his father in 1804, he disposed of the estate in Argyllshire, retaining only the superiority to connect him with the county, and took up his residence at <b>Birfield</b> Lodge, near Ipswich, Suffolk. He was a magistrate and deputy-lieutenant of the county.|$|E
5000|$|Beginning a {{programme}} of diversification {{into the}} automotive field in 1966 GKN bought BRD's much larger competitor, <b>Birfield</b> Ltd, which held the great {{bulk of the}} British market for CVJs, constant velocity joints, and was a company that since 1938 had incorporated both the Sheffield based Laycock Engineering later {{best known as a}} postwar overdrive manufacturer, and Hardy Spicer Limited of Birmingham, England, also a manufacturer of constant-velocity joints. [...] Historically, such joints had few applications, even following the improved design proposed by Alfred H. Rzeppa in 1936. However, in 1959, Alec Issigonis had developed the revolutionary Mini motor car that relied on the Hardy Spicer joints for its front wheel drive technology. The massive expansion in the exploitation of front wheel drive in the 1970s and 1980s led to the acquisition of other similar businesses and a 43% share of the world market by 2002.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between job satisfaction and mental health. The statistics include all employees of two industrial companies in the city of Ardabil. The sample of 90 people was selected randomly for the study. They were asked to complete <b>Birfield</b> job satisfaction and Ruth questionnaire and Goldbergâ€˜s general health scale. Data was analysis using multiple regressions and t-test. Finding of the research indicated that there was a positive relationship between job unsatisfaction employees and global index of mental health, social action and depression. It was found that employed women than employed men are more satisfied with their jobs. In addition, workers who have a longer history in their jobs have much job satisfaction. The results of this study, confirmed previous findings on the role of job satisfaction in the provision of mental health workers, especially to improve social relations and reduce depression...|$|E
40|$|Constant {{velocity}} (CV) joints {{have been}} widely used for modern vehicles. The sealed grease of CV joints must pro-vide low friction and wear protection for the lifetime use of the vehicle. Grease performance affects the vibration and noise level in the vehicle. Vehicles that have traveled long distances may suffer mechanical and thermal overloads, thus causing the grease to degrade due to changes in its physical and chemical properties. In this article, the grease degradation phenomenon in CV joints is investigated by collecting grease samples from both tripod joints and <b>Birfield</b> joints in actual vehicles that traveled various ranges of distance. In order to analyze the property changes of grease, grease penetration and oxidation induced time are measured using a penetration meter and infrared (IR) spectrometer, respectively. Where oxygen in-duced time (OIT) is the point that the oxidation occurs in grease. The performance variations of grease are investigated by measuring the friction and wear using linear-oscillation (SRV, Schwingung (oscillation) Reibung (friction) Verschleiss (wear)) test machine as well as the four-ball wear tester. Degra-dation of properties as well as performance in CV joint grease due to physical and/or chemical changes is identified...|$|E
