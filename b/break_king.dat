He drove four races in Formula Palmer Audi at the Silverstone round in 2010, {{managing}} {{to get a}} podium and impressing series boss Jonathan Palmer. In 2011, he has signed up for three rounds of the Formula Two championship, at Spa-Francorchamps, the Nürburgring and Brands Hatch during the Formula Renault UK summer <b>break.</b> <b>King</b> will be the youngest driver {{to take part in}} the modern era of the series.|$|E
50|$|King, {{along with}} his wife Debbi, started dancing at Ohio State home {{football}} games in 1973. At that time he was known as the B Deck Dancer. He remained the B Deck Dancer until 1984 when the Ohio State Marching Band introduced its rendition of the Pointer Sisters’ “Neutron Dance”. The spectators established a connection between the song and King and began to chant, “Neutron Man, Neutron Man”. From that point forward, the Neutron Man would dance at every Ohio State home football game during the third quarter <b>break.</b> <b>King</b> eventually began to wear his scarlet and gray beret and his very own Ohio State Buckeyes jersey with “Neutron Man” printed on the back.|$|E
5000|$|After touring {{extensively}} {{in support of}} the duo's second studio album, Celebration Rock (2012), Brian King and David Prowse took a break from Japandroids for six months: [...] "When we got home, we were just totally destroyed, really burnt out both physically and mentally to the point that despite how much we love playing in the band, we just needed a break; at that point, we hadn’t taken a serious break from the band in five years. So we took about six months off - the first half of 2014 - and decided to dedicate that time to ourselves and our personal lives." [...] Reconvening after their self-imposed <b>break,</b> <b>King</b> and Prowse spent a year writing Near to the Wild Heart of Life between 2014 and 2015; starting the process in New Orleans: [...] "We rented a house and spent about five weeks in this house with all the gear {{in the living room and}} just played every day. We hadn’t written in a long time, and it took a minute to just get the ball rolling again." ...|$|E
25|$|The {{first half}} of Oswiu's reign was spent {{in the shadow of}} Penda, who {{dominated}} much of Britain from 642 until 655, seemingly making and <b>breaking</b> <b>kings</b> as it suited him. The future kingdom of Northumbria was still composed of two distinct kingdoms in Oswiu's lifetime. The northerly kingdom of Bernicia, which extended from the River Tees to the Firth of Forth, was ruled by Oswiu. The kingdom of Deira, lying between the North York Moors and the Humber, was ruled by a series of Oswiu's kinsmen, initially as a separate kingdom, later as a form of appanage for Oswiu's sons.|$|R

60|$|At this {{critical}} juncture {{there was an}} alarm of a conspiracy among the tories {{in the city and}} on Long Island, suddenly to take up arms and co-operate with the British troops on their arrival. The wildest reports were in circulation concerning it. Some of the tories were to <b>break</b> down <b>King's</b> Bridge, others were to blow up the magazines, spike the guns, and massacre all the field-officers. Washington was to be killed or delivered up to the enemy. Some of his own body-guard were said to be in the plot. Several publicans of the city were pointed out as having aided or abetted it.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} after {{the decline of}} Viking threats, many of Ireland's smaller kingdoms became {{dominated}} by larger ones, in a natural yet bloody evolution towards centralized monarchy. Various families contended for the high-kingship. Allegiance with Osraige could make or <b>break</b> a <b>king's</b> bid for the high-kingship, although the kings of Osraige never attempted the position themselves. King Donnchadh mac Gilla Pátraic, arguably Osraige's most powerful ruler who brought the kingdom to the zenith of its power, plundered Dublin, Meath and successfully conquered neighboring Leinster in 1033, held the Óenach Carmán and ruled both kingdoms {{until his death in}} 1039. In 1085 and 1114, the city of Cill Chainnigh was burned.|$|R

50|$|Heritage of <b>Kings</b> <b>breaks</b> {{from the}} typical pattern that {{previous}} The Settlers games had established; while the basic real-time strategy concept of resource micromanagement remains the same, {{a lot of}} the gameplay features have changed from those of The Settlers IV, and slightly resemble many of the gameplay aspects of Cossacks: European Wars. Heritage of Kings is also the first Settlers game in 3D.|$|R

A consecrated peacock, a tumultuous, turbulent, traitorous priest, a Spanish rogue ruffler who, I am told, keeps {{about him}} {{a band of}} bloody mercenaries to <b>break</b> the <b>King's</b> peace and slay loyal English folk. Well, consecrated Abbot, I'll tell you who I am. I am Thomas Legh, his Grace's Visitor and Royal Commissioner to inspect the Houses called religious, and I am come hither upon {{complaint}} made by yonder Prioress of Blossholme Nunnery, as to your dealings with certain of his Highness's subjects whom, she says, you have accused of witchcraft for purposes of revenge and unlawful gain.

Frederick would be ever {{hovering}} round them, attacking them on every opportunity, and preventing them from sending off detached columns; while the cavalry of Ziethen and Seidlitz would effectually prevent Cossacks and Croats from going out to gather stores for the armies, and to plunder and massacre on their own account. I doubt whether anything short of the annihilation of his army would <b>break</b> the <b>king's</b> spirit and, so far as I can see, that is by no means likely to take place." ...|$|R

After hearing the teenagers' story, Gus has them accompany {{him to the}} abandoned Kings Park Psychiatric Center, where they dig up the grave of Mary's baby, Gus being convinced that reuniting mother and child will appease Mary's spirit. The baby's casket is empty, so the group <b>break</b> into <b>Kings</b> Park in search of answers, and discover paperwork that reveals that Mary's child is Alissa, a missing party guest visiting from Chicago. A series of flashbacks show that Alissa killed everyone either due to being influenced by Mary, or because she is experiencing the onset of a disorder similar to her to mother's.|$|R
2500|$|Rabbi Johanan noted a {{similarity}} between the Hebrew verb [...] "to break" [...] and the name [...] "Perez" [...] (...) in [...] and deduced that the name presaged that kings would descend from him, for a <b>king</b> <b>breaks</b> for himself a way.

50|$|In {{some ways}} Kaahumanu {{was ahead of}} her time and championed the rights of native Hawaiian women, {{although}} this was to her own advantage.

50|$|In {{the porch}} of the western door lie the fifteenth-century monuments of Sir Roland Fitz-Eustace, Lord Portlester, who died in 1496, and his wife, Margaret. Fitz-Eustace was Deputy Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, then Lord Chancellor of Ireland and finally Lord High Treasurer of Ireland. His refusal to {{surrender}} this last post led to a <b>break</b> with the <b>king</b> and almost to civil war. He was buried at Cotlandstown, County Kildare. Peter Talbot the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, who died in prison in 1680, {{is said to have been}} secretly entombed nearby.|$|R

He succeeded on the death of his father, Mamia III Dadiani, as eristavi ("duke") of Odishi and ex officio mandaturt-ukhutsesi ("Lord High Steward") of Imereti in 1533. Dadiani's <b>break</b> with the <b>king</b> of Imereti brought about his {{downfall}} and imprisonment in 1546.

50|$|Also in 911, Louis the Child, {{the last}} Carolingian king of East Francia died, and nobles of Lotharingia, {{who had been}} loyal to him, under the {{leadership}} of Reginar, Duke of Lorraine declared Charles their new <b>king,</b> <b>breaking</b> from East Francia which had elected non-Carolingian Conrad I as the new king. Charles had tried to win Lotharingian support for years, for instance, by marrying in April 907 a Lotharingian woman named Frederuna, and in 909 his niece Cunigunda married Wigeric of Lotharingia. Charles defended Lotharingia against two attacks by Conrad I. In 925 Lotharingia was once again seized by East Francia.|$|R
50|$|The Treaty of Ribe was a {{proclamation}} made by King Christian I of Denmark to {{a number}} of German nobles enabling himself to become count of Holstein-Rendsburg and regain the Danish duchy of Schleswig. Another clause gave the nobility the right to revolt should the <b>king</b> <b>break</b> the agreement (a usual feature of medieval coronation charters). Regarding Holstein-Rendsburg, the arrangement was pretty straightforward, the King of Denmark became in personal union count of Holstein-Rendsburg but was not allowed to annex the county, which was part of the Holy Roman Empire, to Denmark proper in real union.|$|R
50|$|The {{proclamation}} {{was issued}} in 1460 and {{established that the}} King of Denmark should also be Duke of Schleswig and Count of Holstein. Another clause gave the nobility the right to revolt should the <b>king</b> <b>break</b> the agreement (a feature of several medieval coronation charters). The agreement was most straightforward regarding {{the future of the}} Holstein, since King Christian I merely added the title as count to his existing title. He was forbidden from annexing Holstein to Denmark and Holstein retained its independence and its position as a subfief of Saxony and subsequently Saxe-Lauenburg, indirectly under the Holy Roman Emperor.|$|R
