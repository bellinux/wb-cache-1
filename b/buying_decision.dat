The JAS-39 is mentioned in the letter as a potential fighter for the program. The request for information concerning the HX Fighter Program was sent in April 2016. The five responses were received in November 2016.

40|$|Cross-functional make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> {{processes}} are strategic decision processes. The {{outcome of a}} make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> affects competitive advantage, strategic development and leads to changes in internal and external relations. When {{trying to make a}} strategic decision concerning make or buy there are several functions {{that will have to be}} included, since the decision requires input regarding both existing and future possibilities. Furthermore, the outcome of the decision will affect the organisation not only in the long-term but also in its day-to-day operations. These are all important reasons for designing and managing the cross-functional make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> process. Current research indicates that there is no one best way in which all organizations can reach make or <b>buy</b> <b>decisions</b> but that these processes need to be cross-functional. There is a need to understand the functional involvement with its differences and consequences in make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> processes. The purpose of this dissertation is to develop knowledge of design and management of cross-functional make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> processes. The main contribution of the literature used in this dissertation is to establish existing research in the field of cross-functional make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> processes. Several decision process models are outlined and their pros-and-cons are analysed. The research gaps found are the basis for three research questions that together lead to the development of knowledge regarding design and management of cross-functional make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> processes. Empirical data were collected from an in-depth, longitudinal case study and two shorter case studies. The cross-functional make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> process is an iterative process including at least five phases, from initiating an investigation to follow-up on the outcome. The process needs different depth of functional integration in the phases in order to be able to move forward efficiently. Therefore, the cross-functional integration is shifting in the five phases, making the process change in resources. The design of the cross-functional make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> process is shaped by at least eight characteristics. These characteristics are organizational position, time for development, complexity of products, designation of process owner, make or buy strategy, production systems, customer relations and supplier relations. They shape the design by determining which functions should be involved, the extent of their involvement, which phases are needed, the number of options for make or buy, formality of the process, importance of the process, information flows and process time, thus due to the process being cross-functional there are consequences. The cross-functional make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> process has disadvantages with regards to several information flows, several functional strategies, power distribution and resource-consumption. However, the advantage is that a focused make or buy strategy can be obtained, resources allocated correctly, and an up-to-date view of the internal and external environment...|$|R

One of marketing concepts that may be used in order to influence customers’ emotions so that they may improve <b>buying</b> <b>decisions</b> is through the experiential marketing consisting of five aspects, which are sense, feel, think, act, and relate. the implementation of experiential marketing in Derajat Celcius may give information and experiences to customers in order to make <b>buying</b> <b>decisions.</b> Therefore, this research has an objective of finding out the influence of experiential marketing (sense, feel, think, act, and relate) on the <b>buying</b> <b>decisions.</b> Based on the analysis results of questionnaire data of 100 customers of Derajat Celcius collected using the accidental sampling technique, several analyses are conducted on the collected data. Those analyses include : validity and reliability tests, classical assumption test, multiple regression analysis, hypothesis examination through the t test and F test, and analysis of determination coefficient (R 2) Hypothesis examination using t test shows that there are two examined independent variables, which are the variables of think and relate, that influence positively and significantly on the dependent variable of <b>buying</b> <b>decisions.</b> Meanwhile, the other three independent variables, which are sense, feel, and act influence positively but not significantly on the dependent variable of <b>buying</b> <b>decisions.</b> Then, by using the F test, it is found that those five independent variables are appropriate to examine the dependent variable of <b>buying</b> <b>decisions.</b> The Adjusted R Square number as much as 0. 535 shows tha 53. 5 percent of the <b>buying</b> <b>decisions</b> variable can be explained by those five independent variables in the regressions equation.

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the dimensions along which make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> processes change over time. Design/methodology/approach The paper is based on a longitudinal in-depth case study of a large industrial company, where the data were collected using interviews, documentation and observations. The data were analyzed using chronological patterns, and findings were then compared with the literature on make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> processes. Findings Nine dimensions were found along which the make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> process had changed over time. The dimensions were cross-functionality, structure, regularity, formality, awareness, mandatory, information distribution and management and flexibility. The causes of the changes were related to a combination of company internal and external events and contexts. Research limitations/implications The findings should be seen as a first attempt in assisting in the creation of a foundation for constructing more dynamic make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> process models. However, since the findings are based on a single case, they need to be complemented by more research in order to help determine how context sensitive the identified dimensions are. Practical implications The nine dimensions of change can be used as a checklist for managers in designing their decision process. Originality/value The paper adds to existing research, which takes a static viewpoint and does not include a dynamic perspective, in that, the longitudinal nature of our research creates opportunities for developing more dynamic make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> process models. The paper clarifies how make or <b>buy</b> <b>decision</b> processes develop over time, and how they cannot be seen as a one-time implementation but rather as a process that needs both structure and flexibility...|$|R
