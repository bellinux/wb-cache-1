5|$|The two {{go ahead}} with their plans to meet Alex, who brings along his friend, Junior (Chaddha) to the hotel. The group discuss their lives over supper, which is cut short by an {{argument}} between Alex and Sahil over the former's irresponsible behaviour. The four head <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> room to collect Sahil's belongings, as Jai plans to leave later that night. Alex notices the guitar and later forces Sahil to play for him, to which Sahil obliges with an original song. Alex dances with Jai, who looks even more impressed with Sahil's artistry. Alex offers to take back Sahil's belongings and give the two some more time together. When he leaves, Sahil and Jai embrace, but do not talk about anything that had happened.|$|E
5|$|A detective named Havez (Dwight McFee) {{takes over}} as Bruckman's guard when Mulder and Scully {{are called to}} {{investigate}} yet another new murder victim: the tarot card reader. As they leave they bump into a bellhop who is delivering food to Bruckman's room. The bellhop is actually the killer, and when he enters the room (while Havez is in the washroom), he is delighted to discover that Bruckman has been brought right to where he works. As {{he is about to}} kill Bruckman, Havez re-enters and the killer attacks and kills him instead. Meanwhile, Scully finds the same silk fiber at the new crime scene, and realizing that the bellhop had it on his tray, deduces that he is the murderer. They rush <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel.</b> Mulder chases the killer to the basement kitchen and the scene plays out as described in Bruckman's earlier premonition, but when the killer attacks Mulder, Scully arrives {{in the nick of time}} and shoots him—what Bruckman had seen was the dying killer's last thoughts, not Mulder's death.|$|E
5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E
50|$|The {{custom of}} keeping ducks {{in the lobby}} {{fountain}} may date back even further than the 1930s. A pre-1915 postcard highlights the ducks playing in the fountain, and one source claims <b>the</b> custom goes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel's</b> opening in 1869.|$|R

25|$|A {{scheduled}} group {{visit to}} Kamakura on 30 June was cancelled after the Beatles {{learned that the}} police could not guarantee their safety. Accompanied by one of their road managers, Lennon and McCartney each managed to venture out at one point, only to be escorted <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> once they were discovered. Starr recalls that every time the Beatles had to leave for an engagement, the process was handled with military-style precision by their Japanese hosts. To lighten the mood, the band took to delaying their exit from the hotel suite, thereby causing consternation for the time-conscious security staff.|$|E
50|$|May brought <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> workers' strike <b>to</b> {{its most}} rousing numbers, but it quickly began to dwindle in June. Since workers {{of color and}} local college {{students}} were hired as strikebreakers, many workers feared {{they would not have}} a job to return <b>to</b> and went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotels,</b> despite <b>the</b> poor working conditions. On June 11, 1912, the Bureau called a meeting between <b>the</b> <b>Hotel</b> Men's Association and <b>the</b> <b>Hotel</b> Workers' International Union to negotiate terms <b>to</b> end <b>the</b> strike, but <b>the</b> <b>Hotel</b> Men's Association ultimately refused to acknowledge them as a union.|$|R

While Alan is playing a game of PAC-MAN the power goes out again. Stu {{suddenly}} realizes where Teddy is. The trio rushes <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> to find Teddy {{who is in the}} elevator unharmed (albeit still missing a finger). Teddy had woken {{up in the middle of}} the night to get more ice for his severed finger (after the first bucket of ice had melted) but became trapped after the power went out. The four use Chow's speedboat, the Perfect Life, the keys for which were in Teddy's pocket, to travel back to the wedding reception.|$|E
25|$|On 6 June 2012, John McAreavey {{said he was}} handcuffed {{by police}} {{officers}} and they examined his body for marks. He also {{saw one of the}} accused (Avinash Treebhoowoon) on two occasions within a number of minutes the day his wife died. McAreavey said that he had gone <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> room looking for his wife when she failed to return to the restaurant after leaving him to get some biscuits from their room to eat with their cups of tea. He found her unconscious in the bath, with the tap running and laid her on the floor and then tried to revive her. The DNA test made by a forensic expert from England revealed that no DNA traces of the two men accused and the other two original suspects were found on Michaela McAreavey body and at the crime scene except the DNA of John McAreavey.|$|E
25|$|One morning, Harold finds Elsie {{sitting on}} a log in the woods, crying {{about the state of}} her life. He comforts her and, as he escorts her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel,</b> they come across one of the Polish women. He wonders how much she saw. That evening, Elsie bursts into Harold's room. Her husband has arrived at the hotel {{unexpectedly}} and is in a terrible rage. At that moment, Philip Clayton runs in. He is carrying a spanner and screams at Elsie, accusing her of having an affair just as one of the Polish women had told him. He chases Elsie out of Harold's room and back to her own. Harold runs after him and is in time to see Elsie throw a paperweight at her husband in self-defence. He falls to the ground and Elsie begs Harold to leave them before he gets himself into trouble. Half an hour later, Mrs Rice joins Harold and tells him that Philip is dead, killed by the blow.|$|E
50|$|The Tulsa Press Club {{established}} {{its headquarters}} on <b>the</b> <b>hotel's</b> mezzanine on July 30, 1950. <b>The</b> club moved <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Enterprise Building in 1956.

50|$|Meanwhile, back in town, {{there is}} an illegal cockfight going on; and Vardella has gone on a killing spree against the {{descendants}} of the people who had tortured and killed her hundreds of years before. On foot through town, Von Helsing and Philip begin searching for Vardella. Vardella shows up at <b>the</b> cockfight <b>to</b> get revenge on the villagers there. Von Helsing comes upon the scene and uses a syringe <b>to</b> drug <b>the</b> witch. They load her in his roadster and take her <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel's</b> kitchen and put her on ice for safekeeping. Then they go to Von Helsing's cave to pick up some ritual tools in order to exorcise Vardella.|$|R

25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hotel</b> Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone knelt down and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E
25|$|David Sheppard and Ray Illingworth both {{suffered}} from throat infections {{from the previous}} day and while Sheppard came to play after seeing a doctor, but Illingworth was sent <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> to recover. Even if Dexter had wanted {{to go for the}} runs England's dismal start would have curtailed his ambitions. David Sheppard was caught - eventually - by Wally Grout on the first ball of the second over from Ken Mackay (1/13) to give him his 50th Test wicket and Geoff Pullar edged the ball to Simpson in the next over from McKenzie (1/63) to reduce England to 4/2. Ken Barrington and Colin Cowdrey saw the innings safely through the next hour and a half, adding 94 before he was run out by Norm O'Neill for 32. Barrington looked completely assured and began sweeping the Australian spin bowlers as Benaud, Simpson and O'Neill all tried their arm. Dexter was out to one-handed catch by Simpson off Benaud with 100 minutes to go and Ray Illingworth was recalled from the hotel in case he needed to bat, but he was not needed. A ball from McKenzie struck a nerve in Tom Graveney's arm, but after he recovered he settled down to a polished innings to accompany Barrington to his hundred. This was reached with a pull for six off Simpson over long-on, his seventh Test century and his first against Australia. Strangely, the stonewalling Barrington would bring up a Test century four times with a six and he hit another in the same over. Benaud brought in the new ball and gave it to Bill Lawry who nearly knocked Barrington's cap off with a beamer that went for 4 byes followed this with 4 wides, as extras were not counted against the bowler in those days this counted as a maiden. Barrington finished with 2 sixes and 16 fours in his 132 not out and he and Graveney (36 not out) played out the day with an unbeaten partnership of 101 to take England to 223/4.|$|E

Rick Shlosser and John McFee played on these tracks, but were dropped from the second sessions.

500|$|However, {{negative}} reviews, {{like the}} one from New York Times film critic, Janet Maslin, killed the publication of Honeycutt's piece. Maslin said of the final scene of the movie, [...] "Anything this moment reveals about Vietnam and about America, not to mention about dogs and merry-go-rounds, has been said better elsewhere." [...] Critic Richard Freeman found Barbara Hershey's character [...] "moronic", and referred to the film as [...] "twaddle." [...] Freeman said it was [...] "fraught with symbolism. Or maybe it is just fraught". He further said of the film, [...] "Actually, it's about David Carradine, of whom the less said the better". The Kokomo Tribune called the story [...] "pointless". When Carradine read the reviews, he went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> bathroom and threw up. It wasn't just that the critics didn't like the picture; they were angry at me for making it,' Carradine said. 'I'll never figure that out.|$|E

500|$|I {{remember}} {{not just}} because it was a win, but also because it was a big fight right into the last night. Fabrizia reminded me the other night that we had a problem with the brake pads, so we lost a lot of time. We finished three days rallying (with one day to go), night and day, 32 seconds in front of Ari Vatanen. We drove the last special stage for the night, came <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>hotel</b> and I could not sleep at all, four hours {{in front of me and}} no sleep.
