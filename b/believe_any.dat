5|$|Instead of {{worrying}} about a possible Austrian threat, Frederick scattered his men facing eastward, the last known location of Daun's army. The troops created an S-shaped line, north to south, adjacent to Hochkirch. The weak (west) side was guarded by an outpost of nine battalions with artillery support; the principal purpose of the infantry was to maintain contact with a deployed scout unit. Eleven battalions and 28 squadrons guarded the east side. Frederick had his best soldiers garrison the village of Hochkirch. He did not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> attack would occur; Daun's army had been dormant in recent months, refusing {{to be drawn into}} battles.|$|E

Most aviation and medical professionals do not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> long-term health effects exist from fume events, and no studies have shown any danger to the public. However, some consumer and aircrew advocacy groups claim that it can cause a medically unrecognized condition they call aerotoxic syndrome, with symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, and possibly premature death.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} find a {{replacement}} for Turunen as the female vocalist of the band, on March 17, 2006 the band allowed vocalists interested for the position to send in demo tapes as an audition for the spot. During this time, speculation began to emerge about who would eventually be chosen, and the band stated on their website that fans should not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> source other than the band itself for information regarding the new vocalist. In the end, the 35-year-old Alyson Avenue's ex-lead singer, Anette Olzon, from Sweden, was chosen.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of heavy {{fighting}} during the night of August 10–11 and during {{the day of the}} 11th, the regimental commander decided that he could not safely move the regimental trains and the artillery through the pass during the day, and accordingly he had made plans to do it that night. That afternoon, however, division commander William B. Kean wanted the division to move forward rapidly, and said that a battalion of the US 24th Infantry Regiment would come up and protect its right, north flank. General Kean apparently did not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> considerable force of enemy troops was in the vicinity of Pongam-ni, despite representations to the contrary.|$|E

Thousands of pregnant women took the drug to relieve their symptoms. At {{the time of the}} drug's development, scientists did not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> drug taken by a pregnant woman could pass across the placental barrier and harm the developing fetus, even though the effect of alcohol on fetal development had been documented by case studies on alcoholic mothers since at least 1957. There soon appeared reports of findings of abnormalities in children being born, traced back {{to the use of the}} drug thalidomide. In late 1959, it was noticed that peripheral neuritis developed in patients who took the drug over a period of time, and it was only after this point that thalidomide ceased to be provided over the counter.|$|E

Persons who have such information and have been withholding it when they know they should report it are leaving themselves open to possible charges of complicity in event the slayer is captured. Make no mistake {{about the fact that}} the slayer will be captured because we will not give up this hunt until he has been captured or killed. All information received will be treated confidentially. We urge you to come in and tell what you know. Don't be hesitant or fear that you are causing an innocent man embarrassment and trouble in as much all investigation will be confidential. This is no time to take any chance on information which might lead us to the slayer. This maniac must be captured. We believe that we are justified in going to any ends to halt this chain of murder. Bear in mind--this killer may strike at any one. He may strike at persons close to him.

She accepted Karim's explanation that Ali had found the brooch {{and that it was}} customary in India to keep anything that one found, whereas the rest of the Household thought Ali had stolen it. In July, Karim was assigned the room previously occupied by Dr (later Sir) James Reid, Victoria's physician, and given the use of a private sitting room.|$|E

500|$|On {{the other}} side of the Atlantic, in the midst of the Anglo–German naval arms race, members of the British House of Commons fretted over the battleships' {{possible}} destinations, though the Admiralty consistently stated that they did not <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> sale would occur. In mid-July and September 1908, the Commons discussed purchasing the ships to bolster the Royal Navy and ensure they would not be sold to a foreign rival, which would disrupt the British naval plan set in place by the [...] "two-power standard," [...] though in March and late July 1908, the Brazilian government officially denied any sale was planned. In March 1909, the British press and House of Commons began pushing for more dreadnoughts after the First Lord of the Admiralty, Reginald McKenna, asserted that Germany had stepped up its building schedule and would complete thirteen dreadnoughts in 1911—four more than previously estimated. Naturally, the subject of purchasing the Brazilian dreadnoughts already being built was brought up, and McKenna had to officially deny that the government was planning to tender an offer for the warships. He also stated that a sale to a foreign nation would be inconsequential, as [...] "our present superiority in strength in 1909–10 is so great that no alarm would be created in the mind of the Board of Admiralty." ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Knocked Up and Waitress, {{two other}} 2007 films about women facing {{unplanned}} pregnancies, Juno was interpreted by some critics {{as having a}} pro-life theme. Ann Hulbert of Slate magazine believed that Juno [...] " [...] both pro-life and pro-choice purism." [...] Jeff Dawson of The Sunday Times believed that the film was inevitably placed in the [...] "unwanted pregnancy subgenre" [...] with Knocked Up and Waitress due to its subject matter but thought that its interpretation as a pro-life film only [...] "muddied the waters". Hadley Freeman of The Guardian criticized Juno for [...] "complet a hat-trick of American comedies in the past 12 months that present abortion as unreasonable, or even unthinkable—a telling social sign", though she noted, [...] "I don't <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> of these films is consciously designed to be anti-abortion propaganda." [...] A. O. Scott, writing for The New York Times, agreed that Juno has [...] "an underlying theme, a message that is not anti-abortion but rather pro-adulthood." [...] Ellen Page commented, [...] "What I get most frustrated at is when people call it a pro-life movie, which is just absurd... The {{most important thing is}} the choice is there, and the film completely demonstrates that." [...] Cody and Page have openly stated that they are pro-choice; Reitman thought that it was [...] "fantastic" [...] that pro-life and pro-choice groups were embracing the film.

500|$|In May 2011, it was {{revealed}} that Susan and Karl's marriage would be run into trouble, when Susan becomes emotionally involved with another man. Susan strikes up a friendship with local builder, Jim Dolan (Scott Parmeter), as he fights cancer, causing problems between herself and Karl. When asked by Channel 5 about her reaction to the storyline, Woodburne said [...] "I think it's a great story. Karl and Susan are both in their 50s; they've been married together; they've raised a bunch of kids; they’ve had careers and jobs. And to use the popular term 'empty nesters', that's what they’re looking at. For him he thinks, 'That's great, terrific! More time for us; we can travel.' But for her it's, 'Well, I don't know how to be that person. I know how to be this person, who's someone who's wrangling kids and busy doing things.' But her challenge I {{think is going to be}} to find out who she is as one half of a couple, as opposed to being the hub of a wheel." [...] The actress revealed she and Fletcher were both worried about Susan and Karl breaking up and having to work with new people, but they <b>believe</b> <b>any</b> new development for the characters is good. Woodburne told Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy that she thought the new storyline was great and said any relationship which has been going for as long as the Kennedys' has, will have its [...] "turbulent patches". Woodburne said Susan develops a very strong attachment to Jim because of her desire to help and be needed. When asked if she was worried about revisiting old ground with the storyline, Woodburne said the new conflict, which arises within Karl and Susan's relationship, is [...] "very appropriate" [...] for the time of their lives and where they are at.|$|E
