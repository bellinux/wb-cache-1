The bottom ITIO film, with a thickness of 200 nm, was sputtered onto the glass substrate. The ITIO film was post-annealed at 350 [*]°C for 10 - 120 min as a seed layer. The effect of post-annealing {{conditions on the}} morphologies, electrical, and optical properties of ITIO films was investigated. A GAZO layer with a thickness of 1200 nm was continuously sputtered onto the ITIO bottom layer. The {{results show that the}} properties of the GAZO/ITIO films were strongly dependent on the post-annealed conditions. The spectral haze (Tdiffuse/Ttotal) of the GAZO/ITIO bi-layer films increases upon increasing the post-annealing time. The haze and resistivity of the GAZO/ITIO bi-layer films were improved with the post-annealed process. After optimizing the deposition and annealing parameters, the GAZO/ITIO <b>bi-layer</b> <b>film</b> has an average transmittance of 83. 20 % at the 400 - 800 nm wavelengths, a maximum haze of 16 %, and the lowest resistivity of 1. 04 [*]×[*] 10 − 3 Ω cm.

The film properties were investigated {{as a function of the}} ferroelectric layer thickness when the thickness of antiferroelectric layer remained unchanged. The highest pyroelectric coefficient of 1 mm thick PZT 30 / 70 film was 3. 18 x 10 - 4 Cm- 2 K- 1.

Chemical sensing using SPR responses of semiconducting metal oxide films deposited on top of noble metal thin films could offer a simple, sensitive and reliable method {{for the detection of}} low concentration of gases. In this article, ultra-thin SnO 2 /Au <b>bi-layer</b> <b>films</b> of various thicknesses were deposited by pulsed laser deposition technique on BK 7 glass substrates and their SPR responses were measured in the Kretschmann geometry of attenuated total reflection using a polarized light beam at 633 nm wavelength. The widths of the SPR dip and SPR angles were investigated as the function of the SnO 2 and Au layer thickness and the wavelength of excited laser light in order to find the optimized structural parameters for SPR gas sensors based on SnO 2 /Au <b>bi-layer</b> <b>films.</b> The SPR responses of <b>bi-layer</b> <b>films</b> were also simulated with Macleod's general characteristic matrices method in order to compare with experimental data.

Electroless nickel planting is a convenient and inexpensive way to deposit nickel without using the electric field or any large facility.

The independent variables were chitosan concentration (0, 7 - 2, 3 %), acetic acid concentration (0, 3 - 3 %) and molar ratio of crosslinking/polymer (0 - 4). Although {{there was a significant}} effect of the single independent variables on the films properties determined throughout the study, no interaction between them was noticed. Chitosan and gelatin blend films were also produced with different proportions, as well as <b>bi-layered</b> <b>films.</b> The rheology of the filmogenic solutions showed that crosslinking only takes place during film formation, and not when the crosslinking agent was added to the solution. We observed that the value of the storage and loss modulus as well as the viscosity, increased with concentration of chitosan. The films obtained were very hydrophilic. Even though the values were relatively high, there was less water absorption capacity and solubility in water and in acid, for central values of molar ratio crosslinker/polymer. Regarding the mechanical properties of the films, the tensile strength was positively affected by the decrease of pH and the increase of molar ratio crosslinker/polymer, whereas, the elongation at rupture was only affected by the chitosan concentration.

40|$|Previously, it {{has been}} shown that the {{strength}} of the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of thin Palladium-Cobalt <b>bi-layer</b> <b>films</b> can be modified when hydrogen gas is absorbed by the Palladium (Pd) layer. In our recent work we showed that the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) response of this material is sensitive to changes in PMA upon exposure of Pd to hydrogen gas. As such, a simple, compact and contactless hydrogen gas sensor could exploit FMR-based detection, of the reversible hydrogen-gas-induced changes in PMA. The magnitude of the FMR peak shift is critical in determining the sensor's sensitivity: the higher the FMR peak shift at a given hydrogen gas concentration, the higher the sensitivity. In the present work we demonstrate that the detection sensitivity is enhanced when the static magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the film plane. A factor of eight times improvement is observed with respect to the in-plane FMR configuration studied previously. An analysis based on the Kittel equation for FMR frequencies of a ferromagnetic film is carried out in order to understand the mechanism of sensitivity enhancement.

Both the preparation and annealing of the TiDy/Pd bi-layer films were performed in situ under UHV conditions. It was found that the surface and bulk morphology of the <b>bi-layer</b> <b>film</b> {{as well as that of}} the Si substrate material undergo a microstructural and chemical conversion after annealing and annealing-induced deuterium evolution from the TiDy phase. Energy-filtered TEM (EFTEM) mapping of cross-section images and argon ion sputter depth profiling XPS analysis revealed both a broad intermixing between the Ti and Pd layers and an extensive inter-diffusion of Si from the substrate into the film bulk area. Segregation of Ti at the Pd top layer surface was found to occur by means of angle-resolved XPS (ARXPS) and the EFTEM analyses.

At applied anodic potentials the WO 3 (H 2 O) x content in the oxide was greater than the WO 3 content, while at applied cathodic potentials the WO 3 cont nt was larger. These {{results are consistent with}} a <b>bi-layer</b> <b>film</b> on W in acidic solution which consists of a compact inner layer of WO 3 and an outer layer of WO 3 (H 2) x. Rotating disk electrode experiments (RDE) demonstrated that the passive dissolution (ipass) of W in acidic solution increased with the angular velocity of the electrode. An increase in ipass nd a corresponding decrease in the thickness of the surface layer with increasing angular velocity is consistent with a rev rsible dissolution mechanism where dissolution is limited by the mass transport of a loosely bound WO 3 (H 2 O) x layer from the surface. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy measurements found that W dissolution in acidic solution was associated with an adsorption pseudocapacitance presumably due to the outer WO 3 (H 2 O) x layer. The value of this psuedocapacitance increased with increasing angular velocity indicating thinning of the layer consistent with RDE and SERS results.

The standard growth rate obtained was 30 to 40 µm per minute and the growth rate, quality and typology of the CNTs can be fine tuned by controlling hydrogen flow rate, quantity of iron and aluminum deposited and their deposition method. The present study confirms the precise role of hydrogen and aluminum in WCVD growth mechanism. The process follows the root growth mechanism with bimetallic catalyst composed of iron and aluminum. The small quantity of water acts as weak oxidant, held responsible for keeping catalyst active for longer time. By employing advanced techniques such as EELS, tomography in transmission electron microscopy, catalyst nano particles were analyzed for their chemical composition. Each catalyst nano particle {{is made up of}} two phases; the central core made up of pure iron surrounded by intermixed phase of iron and aluminum. The two-phase catalyst was continuously hydrolyzed by supplied water vapor; confirmed by XRD and XPS measurements. Hydroxyl groups produced on surface of the catalyst utilized to selectively etch the amorphous carbon from the surface to keep the catalyst clean. Therefore, catalyst stays active for longer time leading the CNT growth up to millimeter long length. Solid state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of pristine CNTs show majority of CNTs´are double walled along with a small percentage of single walled carbon nanotubes. The shift to lower energy indicates most of the CNTs possess semiconducting characteristics. A split of 10 ppm was recorded for DWNTs consisting one metallic and one semi conducting tube. Smaller tube diameter or metallic nature of CNTs shift the peak position to higher ppm. Electronic applications of carbon nanotubes: Carbon nanotubes can be grown vertically or even horizontally as required. The horizontally grown carbon nanotubes were used to fabricate field effect transistors. CNTs are single walled, semiconducting, p-type in nature delivering a device with high (2000 to 5000) on off ratio. Transistor is sensitive enough to depict good modulation of current for small value of gate voltage; ideal to realize various sensors. Also, using alcohol-CVD method, growth of single CNT bridging two silicon pillars is demonstrated. The CNT bridging two Si-pillars will be studied to gas sensor applications. On the other hand, vertically grown CNT blocks have already been tested for room temperature gas sensing. Vertically grown structured blocks of aligned carbon nanotubes exhibit excellent field emission characteristics. Current emission in milliampere range, stable emission and constant enhancement factor for up and down cycle are salient features. CNT blocks with appropriate size and intermediate distance are proposed for cold cathode applications. Synthesis of metal oxide - CNT hybrid materials: A new methodology is developed to prepare hybrid materials of metal oxides and carbon nanotubes. Using various techniques, metal oxide nano particles or film are deposited on previously grown carbon nanotubes blocks or films. In the present study, the ordered structure of carbon nanotubes is modified with nano particles of titanium dioxide, zinc oxide and iron oxide. The average distribution of particle size is of order 5 to 10 nm, covering the side walls of carbon nanotubes. CNT blocks deposited with ZnO and TiO 2 particles show excellent field emission properties. Zinc oxide - CNT bilayer film is demonstrated as a light sensor. The <b>bi-layer</b> <b>film</b> is sensitive to light of different wavelength. A single step process to form magnetic composite of CNT and iron oxide is introduced. The particle size of iron oxide is small enough (5 to 15 nm) that the composite exhibits super paramagnetic properties. As the CNT and iron oxide both are bio compatible, composite shows potential in bio medical applications. Ordered CNT blocks deposited using ZnO and TiO 2 can serve as a potential material for solar energy harvesting or hydrogen generation by water splitting. The electrode membrane assembly of as grown film of carbon nanotubes decorated using platinum nano particles is fabricated and being tested for fuel cell applications. The average size of the platinum nano particle is of order 2 to 4 nm, obtained by self reduction technique. Growth of Neuron cells on CNT blocks: Carbon nanotube blocks are used as substrate to grow varieties of nerve cells. The growth takes place selectively on carbon nanotubes demonstrating affinity of cells towards CNTs. Unlike previous reports, growth is demonstrated on pristine CNTs. Somas found to have numerous neurites with several sub branching i. e. axons forming interconnects. Not only this, cells interconnect each other forming a cell bridge between two CNT blocks. The investigation using spheroids made up of neurons affirms the affinity of cells towards CNTs as many of the somas migrate to CNT blocks leaving spheroids. The complete study corroborates the potential of CNT structure as a electrode for the growth of neuron cell. CNTs are biocompatible, nano-sized and electrically conducting; in short, an ideal electrode for studying cell transport mechanism, neuron cell signaling and can even be a promising material for developing neuronal prosthesis. As a center point of this work, water assisted chemical vapor deposition method is proved to be an optimal growth technique for multi-dimensional field of carbon nanotubes. This method not only offers the possibility to grow good quality CNTs of different typology or morphology, but also ease of maneuvering the experimental parameter to visualize different forms or architectures serving devices with high order sensitivity at sub micron scale. The study on composite of metal oxides and CNTs demonstrates the diversity of this field. Few potential applications were successfully demonstrated while many more can be thought of. The introductory work on growth of nerve cells shows exquisite potential of CNTs in the field of bio-nano-technology. By combining two fields; CNT based FET devices and growth of biological cells on CNTs; together, biosensors can be visualized. Nonetheless, CNTs put forth a wide range of properties addressing the constant demand of new or better materials to sustain the technological development...|$|E
