The description of the municipal brewery lets us see in detail the statutes and working of the brewers' guild, including its membership and its problems with beer taverns, through the municipal and guild chronicle.

5|$|Home Made Mince Pie is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film is a comedy of circumstances, in which the Gale family is going to host a dinner. The focus of the humor is in a mince pie that <b>brandy</b> is added to {{in an attempt to}} make it more appreciable, but three people each add <b>brandy</b> to the pie. Everyone becomes tipsy upon eating the pie, including the family cat, and the film concludes. No cast or staff credits for this film are known. The film was released on September 27, 1910, to mixed reviews in trade publications. Reviewers mentioned that the film was too long and it was unbelievable that one pie split eight ways would be able to impact everyone. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

40|$|A chemometric {{study was}} carried out to typify cider <b>brandies</b> {{according}} {{to the type of}} wood employed in the maturation process and their aging time.

Univariate data treatment was not sufficient to enable differentiation of the classes of cider <b>brandies</b> on the basis of wood type and maturation time. Two linear combinations of original variables, ascertained by principal components analysis, provided an adequate data structurization. A mathematical decision rule was established to classify cider <b>brandies</b> with prediction capacities of 92 and 97 % using an LDA method and Bayesian analysis, respectively. The use of the PLS algorithm allowed the authors to differentiate cider <b>brandies</b> according to the age and type of oak used in the aging process...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Brandýs</b> nad Labem-Stará Boleslav ( [...] ; Brandeis-Altbunzlau) is an {{administratively}} united pair {{of towns}} in the Central Bohemian Region of the Czech Republic, {{in the heart of}} the agricultural region of Polabí, about 25 km northeast from Prague. It is part of the Prague metropolitan area. It lies upon the Elbe river, <b>Brandýs</b> nad Labem on the left bank and Stará Boleslav on the right bank. The place is the longest-named one in the Czech Republic. <b>Brandýs</b> nad Labem dates its origin to the 13th century. Stará Boleslav was named by Boleslav I who built here his castle in the beginning of the 10th century. In 1960, the two adjacent towns were joined to form one town of <b>Brandýs</b> nad Labem-Stará Boleslav. With a population of about 18,000, it is the second largest Czech united pair of towns (Czech: dvojměstí) after Frýdek-Místek.|$|R
