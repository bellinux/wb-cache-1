25|$|Much of the Caribbean {{economic}} development was contingent to Europeans' demand for sugar, which plantation owners traded for European and North American manufactured goods. Saint Domingue also had extensive coffee, cocoa, and indigo plantations, {{but these were}} smaller and less profitable than the wealthy sugar plantations. Starting in the 1730s, French engineers constructed complex irrigation systems to increase sugarcane production. By the 1740s Saint-Domingue, together with Jamaica, had become the main supplier of the world's sugar. Sugar production depended on extensive manual labor provided by enslaved Africans in the harsh Saint-Domingue colonial plantation economy. Saint-Domingue was the most profitable French colony in the entire world, indeed {{one of the most}} profitable of all the European colonies in the 18th century, with an average of 600 ships engaged every year in shipping products from Saint-Domingue to Bordeaux and the value of Saint-Domingue's goods almost equal in value to all of the products shipped from the British 13 colonies to Great Britain. The economic importance of St. Domingue to France {{can be seen in the}} livelihood of 1 million out of the 25 million or so people who lived in the Kingdom of France in 1789 depended directly upon the imports of coffee, indigo and sugar from St. Domingue, and several million indirectly depended upon trade from France's richest colony to maintain their standard of living. To sustain the sugar production amid the unhealthy climate of the Caribbean with malaria and yellow fever running rampant was slavery. In one year alone, namely 1787, the French imported about 20, 000 slaves from Africa into Saint-Domingue while the British imported about 38, 000 slaves to all of their Caribbean colonies. The death rate from yellow fever was such that at least 50% of the slaves imported from Africa died within a year of arriving, and as such the masters preferred to work their slaves as hard as possible while providing with them with the barest minimum of food and shelter, calculating that it was <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the most work out of their slaves with lowest possible expense possible since they were probably going to die of yellow fever anyway. The death rate was so high that polyandry - one woman being married to several men at the same time - came to be a common form of marriage among the slaves. As slaves had no legal rights, rape by the masters was a common occurrence on the plantations.|$|E

500|$|Gunsmoke was {{originally}} a half-hour program filmed in black-and-white. The series expanded {{to an hour}} in length with season seven and began filming in color in season twelve. During its run 635 episodes were broadcast, of which 233 were 30 minutes in length and 402 were 60 minutes in length. [...] Of the hour-long episodes 176 were in black-and-white and 226 in color. During season two, Gunsmoke {{became one of the}} ten most popular programs on American television and moved to number one in the third season. It remained at number one until 1961 and stayed in the top twenty until 1964. The series returned to prominence in 1967 following a shift in its programming time from Saturday to Monday night. [...] From there Gunsmoke remained in the top twenty for the next seven years, dropping out only in its final season. [...] In May 1975 CBS canceled the series. [...] Alan Wagner, the network's vice president at the time, said, [...] "It's <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of a program one year too soon than one year too late." [...] Between 1987 and 1994 five television movies based on the series were aired by CBS.|$|E
500|$|Friedman {{defended his}} {{activity}} in Chile {{on the grounds}} that, in his opinion, the adoption of free market policies not only improved the economic situation of Chile but {{also contributed to the}} amelioration of Pinochet's rule and to the eventual transition to a democratic government during 1990. That idea is included in Capitalism and Freedom, in which he declared that economic freedom is not only desirable in itself but is also a necessary condition for political freedom. In his 1980 documentary Free to Choose, he said the following: [...] "Chile is not a politically free system, and I do not condone the system. But the people there are freer than the people in Communist societies because government plays a smaller role. ...The conditions {{of the people in the}} past few years has been getting better and not worse. They would be still <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of the junta and to be able to have a free democratic system." [...] In 1984, Friedman stated that he has [...] "never refrained from criticizing the political system in Chile." [...] In 1991 he said: [...] "I have nothing good to say about the political regime that Pinochet imposed. It was a terrible political regime. The real miracle of Chile is not how well it has done economically; the real miracle of Chile is that a military junta was willing to go against its principles and support a free market regime designed by principled believers in a free market. [...] In Chile, the drive for political freedom, that was generated by economic freedom and the resulting economic success, ultimately resulted in a referendum that introduced political democracy. Now, at long last, Chile has all three things: political freedom, human freedom and economic freedom. Chile will continue to be an interesting experiment to watch to see whether it can keep all three or whether, now that it has political freedom, that political freedom will tend to be used to destroy or reduce economic freedom." [...] He stressed that the lectures he gave in Chile were the same lectures he later gave in China and other socialist states.|$|E

[...] He checked into a six-week treatment program at the Menninger Clinic in Topeka, Kansas, and kicked his habit. [...] "For any number of reasons, the first three weeks were 'hell on earth,' Richard says, 'but after that, things really started to change, and of course, all for the better.'

2500|$|Speaking of the {{crossover}} as a whole, Oliver Sava at The A.V. Club {{felt the}} episodes did [...] "admirable work advancing the overarching narrative while maintaining each show's distinct perspective" [...] along with being [...] "a {{hell of a}} lot of fun, and it's significantly expanded the scope of the Arrowverse by bringing in an extraterrestrial enemy... There's an entire universe to explore, and this crossover has opened the door for the CW's DC shows to go cosmic in the future." [...] Ed Gross for Empire stated, [...] ""Invasion" [...] is the proverbial mixed bag. As a crossover, it does an extremely effective job in bringing the characters from four different shows together, the rapport between them feeling natural and oftentimes genuinely funny... The real problem with [...] "Invasion" [...] is that it was intended to be, and was promoted as, a massive adventure, but in reality the whole Dominators storyline was rather underwhelming. Part of that is creative – it would have been <b>better</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a fuller understanding of who these beings really are and how they're able to know the long-term effects of Flashpoint; plus the resolution seems awfully pat... and lacks the resolutionary scope that was expected." [...] Despite some of the criticism, Gross gave the crossover 4 stars out of 5. Collider.com's Allison Keene said, [...] "On the positive side, the interactions among cast members of the four shows – Supergirl, The Flash, Arrow, and Legends of Tomorrow – were as delightful as ever. Though Arrow is often the anchor, The Flash usually sets the tone for the crossovers, and so the other shows incorporate its light-hearted, witty banter and a fast-paced action and editing... But on the negative side, the crossovers can also starkly highlight each show's weaknesses," [...] concluding, [...] "There are things [...] "Invasion!" [...] as a whole did really well, and others it didn't, with each series' strengths and weaknesses being highlighted and tested. But with each new expansion, there are things the shows can learn from, and it remains fun for fans".|$|E
