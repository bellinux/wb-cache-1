2500|$|As {{in other}} Indo-European languages, a verb in Proto-Germanic {{could have a}} preverb {{attached}} to it, modifying its meaning (cf. e.g. *fra-werþaną [...] "to perish", derived from *werþaną [...] "to become"). [...] In Proto-Germanic, the preverb was still a clitic that could {{be separated from the}} verb (as also in Gothic, as shown by the behavior of second-position clitics, e.g. diz-uh-þan-sat [...] "and then he seized", with clitics uh [...] "and" [...] and þan [...] "then" [...] interpolated into dis-sat [...] "he seized") rather than a <b>bound</b> <b>morpheme</b> that is permanently attached to the verb. [...] At least in Gothic, preverbs could also be stacked {{one on top of the}} other (similar to Sanskrit, different from Latin), e.g. ga-ga-waírþjan [...] "to reconcile".|$|E

5000|$|<b>Bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> appear only as {{parts of}} words, always in {{conjunction}} with a root and sometimes with other <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes.</b> For example, un- appears only accompanied by other morphemes to form a word. Most <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> in English are affixes, particularly prefixes and suffixes. Examples of suffixes are -tion, -ation, -ible, -ing, etc. <b>Bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> that are not affixes are called cranberry morphemes.|$|R
40|$|Freestanding and <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> {{differ in}} many (psycho) {{linguistic}} aspects. Some theorists {{have claimed that}} the representation and retrieval of freestanding and <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> {{in the course of}} language production are governed by similar processing mechanisms. Alternatively, it has been proposed that both types of morphemes may be selected for production in different ways. In this article, the authors first review the available experimental evidence related to this topic and then present new experimental data pointing to the notion that freestanding and <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> are retrieved following distinct processing principles: freestanding morphemes are subject to competition, <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> not...|$|R

50|$|In morphology, a <b>bound</b> <b>{{morpheme}}</b> is a morpheme {{that appears}} only {{as part of}} a larger word; a free morpheme or unbound morpheme is one that can stand alone or can appear with other lexemes. A <b>bound</b> <b>morpheme</b> is also known as a bound form, and similarly a free morpheme is a free form.|$|E
5000|$|Cranberry morphemes are {{a special}} form of <b>bound</b> <b>morpheme</b> whose {{independent}} meaning has been displaced and serves only to distinguish one word from another, like in cranberry, {{in which the}} free morpheme berry is preceded by the <b>bound</b> <b>morpheme</b> cran-, meaning [...] "crane" [...] from the earlier name for the berry, [...] "crane berry".|$|E

50|$|A {{language}} {{with a very}} low ratio of <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> to unbound morphemes is an isolating language. Since such a language uses few <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes,</b> it expresses most grammatical relationships by word order so it is an analytic language.|$|R
5000|$|Words can {{be formed}} purely from <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes,</b> as in English permit, {{ultimately}} from Latin [...] "through" [...] + [...] "I send", where per- and -mit are <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> in English. However, {{they are often}} thought of as simply a single morpheme.|$|R

25|$|Affixally polysynthetic languages, as {{the name}} suggests, are those that use only non-root-bound morphemes to express {{concepts}} that in less synthetic languages are expressed by separate words such as adjectives and adverbs. They also use these <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> to make other nouns and verbs from a basic root, {{which can lead to}} very complex word forms without non-lexical suffixes. These <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> often relate to body parts, other essential items of the culture of the language's speakers or features of the landscape where the language is spoken. Deictics and other spatial and temporal relations are also very common among these <b>bound</b> <b>morphemes</b> in affixally polysynthetic languages.|$|R

5000|$|Particularly in {{the study}} of Semitic languages, a suffix is called an afformative, as they can alter the form of the words.

5000|$|In English, {{a common}} haplographical mistake is the {{rendering}} of consecutive letters between morphemes {{as a single}} letter. Many commonly misspelled words have this form.
