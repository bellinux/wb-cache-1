In 1954, according to the Soviet file on him in From Russia, With Love, Bond is made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George.|$|E
5|$|By 1941 radar {{was slowly}} being {{introduced}} within the Navy and Hordern was appointed {{as one of}} the first operatives who communicated enemy movements to the RAF. He later said that the post was owed to his clear diction and deep vocal range. His commentary impressed his superior officers so much that by early 1942 he had <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> job as a Fighter Direction Officer, and then first lieutenant on board HMS Illustrious. Shortly after the departure of his immediate superior, he was promoted to lieutenant commander, a post which he occupied for two years. Alongside his naval responsibilities, he was also appointed as the ship's entertainment officer, and was responsible for organising shows featuring various members of Illustriouss crew as the show's cast.|$|E

5|$|Domitian's {{campaign}} against Dacia was overall unsuccessful; however, the Romans winning {{in a minor}} skirmish allowed him to claim it as a victory, even though he ended up paying the King of Dacia, Decebalus, an annual tribute of eight million sesterces in tribute to end the war. Domitian returned to Rome, and received an ovation, but not a full triumph. Considering that Domitian had <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> title of Imperator for military victories 22 times, this was markedly restrained, suggesting that the populace, {{or at least the}} senate, was {{aware of the fact that}} it had been a less than successful war, despite Domitian's claims otherwise. However, in 89AD, Domitian invaded the Iazyges, along with the Quadi and Marcomanni. Few details are known of this war, but it is recorded that the Romans were defeated.|$|E

While most winners have been authors and editors, five winners have been primarily artists of fantasy art and book covers, and three winners are best known for founding or running publishing houses that produce fantasy works.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though this}} {{campaign}} is overshadowed by other battles of the revolution, {{it was one of}} the most important. The Maniates stopped the Egyptians and Ibrahim Pasha who had not been defeated this decisively before.

5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> variable star designation HO Librae.

However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|Health: Brown said {{he wanted}} doctors' {{surgeries}} to open at weekends, and GPs to be on-call in the evenings.

Lord Ara Darzi was appointed to review NHS service delivery, especially in London. Proposed policies included the induction of polyclinics, which would be open to tender and possibly run by private companies.|$|E
5|$|In July 2012 it was {{reported}} that police have <b>been</b> <b>given</b> <b>the</b> power to issue £50 on-the-spot fines for littering, cycling outside designated areas and for dog fouling offences. In August 2012 a dog owner was ordered to pay £315 after allowing five dogs to chase ducks in the park.
