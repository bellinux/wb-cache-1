5|$|The IPA is {{more common}} in bilingual dictionaries, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> {{exceptions}} here too. Mass-market bilingual Czech dictionaries, for instance, tend to use the IPA only for sounds not found in the Czech language.|$|E
60|$|For as to {{this world}} in which we live, so to the God who created that world, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a terrible aspect. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> calm: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> storm also. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> {{fertilizing}} sunshine: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> also the destroying thunderbolt. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> the solid and fruitful earth, where man can till and build; <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> the earthquake and the flood likewise, which destroy in a moment the works of man. So <b>there</b> <b>is</b> in God boundless love, and boundless mercy: <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>is,</b> too, a wrath of God, and a fire of God which burns eternally against all evil and falsehood. And woe to those who fall under that wrath; who are even scorched for a moment by that fire.|$|R

5|$|The main {{land use}} in the {{watershed}} of Mud Creek is agricultural land, which accounts for 62.97 {{percent of the total}} area. 31.49 percent of the watershed is forested and 5.54 percent is developed land. Most of the forested land is on the watershed's southern and eastern edges, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> some patches of it elsewhere, most of which are fairly small. Most of the developed land is near Jerseytown and Washingtonville, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> several other small areas of development in the watershed's lower reaches and a few other areas in its upper reaches.|$|E
60|$|The heaven {{was still}} above his head, and the sand was still beneath his feet; and Perseus looked up, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing <b>but</b> the {{blinding}} {{sun in the}} blinding blue; and round him, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> nothing <b>but</b> the blinding sand.|$|R

5|$|A minor {{class of}} sheep are the dairy breeds. Dual-purpose breeds that may {{primarily}} be meat or wool sheep {{are often used}} secondarily as milking animals, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> a few breeds that are predominantly used for milking. These sheep produce a higher quantity of milk and have slightly longer lactation curves. In {{the quality of their}} milk, the fat and protein content percentages of dairy sheep vary from non-dairy breeds, but lactose content does not.|$|E
5|$|A {{vector space}} (also called a linear space) is a {{collection}} of objects called vectors, which may be added together and multiplied ("scaled") by numbers, called scalars. Scalars are often taken to be real numbers, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> also vector spaces with scalar multiplication by complex numbers, rational numbers, or generally any field. The operations of vector addition and scalar multiplication must satisfy certain requirements, called axioms, listed below.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Bockscar {{returned}} to the United States in November 1945 and served with the 509th at Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. It was nominally assigned to the Operation Crossroads task force, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no records indicating that it deployed for the tests. In August 1946, it {{was assigned to the}} 4105th Army Air Force Unit at Davis-Monthan Army Air Field, Arizona, for storage.|$|E
5|$|An {{enormous}} {{variety of}} genomic structures {{can be seen}} among viral species; as a group, they contain more structural genomic diversity than plants, animals, archaea, or bacteria. There are millions of different types of viruses, although only about 5,000 types have been described in detail. As of September 2015, the NCBI Virus genome database has more than 75,000 complete genome sequences. <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> doubtlessly many more to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|At Briton Ferry, {{the canal}} ends under the M4 {{motorway}} at a scrapyard, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> plans to refurbish Brunel's Briton Ferry dock, {{just to the}} south, and a short extension to it would provide a good terminus. In Neath itself, a masterplan for the Canal Green area, developing both the river frontage and canal sides, {{has the potential to}} provide a canal basin and moorings for Neath.|$|E

5|$|Bird species {{native to}} the acacia koa–ōhia forest include the Hawaiian crow (Corvus hawaiiensis), the akepa (Loxops coccineus), Hawaii creeper (Oreomystis mana), ʻakiapōlāʻau (Hemignathus munroi), and Hawaiian hawk (Buteo solitarius), {{all of which are}} endangered, threatened, or near threatened; the Hawaiian crow in {{particular}} is extinct in the wild, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> plans to reintroduce the species into the Hakalau reserve.|$|E

5|$|Cognitive {{behavioral}} therapy (CBT) is {{a useful}} treatment when OCD is present, and there is increasing evidence supporting the use of habit reversal (HRT) {{in the treatment of}} tics. There is evidence that HRT reduces tic severity, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> methodological limitations in the studies, and a need for more trained specialists and better large-scale studies.|$|E

5|$|DNA {{profiling}} is {{also used}} in DNA paternity testing to determine if someone is the biological parent or grandparent {{of a child with}} the probability of parentage is typically 99.99% when the alleged parent is biologically related to the child. Normal DNA sequencing methods happen after birth, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> new methods to test paternity while a mother is still pregnant.|$|E
5|$|Due to an {{increase}} of ridership, the MTA has tried to increase capacity wherever possible by adding more frequent service, specifically during the evening hours. However, this increase will not likely {{keep up with the}} growth of subway ridership. Some lines have capacity for additional trains during peak times, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> too few subway cars for this additional service to be operated.|$|E
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{reproduction}} most amphibians require fresh water although some lay their eggs on land and have developed various means of keeping them moist. A few (e.g. Fejervarya raja) can inhabit brackish water, <b>but</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> no true marine amphibians. There are reports, however, of particular amphibian populations unexpectedly invading marine waters.
