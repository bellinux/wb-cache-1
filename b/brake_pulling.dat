50|$|Their {{construction}} was a wooden plank, around two feet long. It rode {{on a single}} double-flanged wheel, with a V-shaped iron slipper on {{the rear of the}} plank. It was balanced by an iron outrigger to one side, with a pipe-shaped roller over its end. This wide roller also allowed for slight variations in gauge. To control the car there was a hand <b>brake.</b> <b>Pulling</b> upwards on this applied an iron brake to the tread of the wheel. Despite the simplicity of the idea, the cars were not unsophisticated in their manufacture. Most was made by the smith, but the cast wheel was made by a foundry in Portmadoc. The brake linkage comprised several pieces, each hand-forged. The brake handle was detachable and fitted over the main lever. It was decoratively forged with a lightweight curve. When not in use it was carried in the quarryman's pocket, a primitive form of anti-theft measure. This could have tragic consequences; one of the few fatal accidents was to children in the 1920s who crashed into a slate wagon through not having the brake handle. For reasons of safety, later operation of the cars became more organised, a responsible mine foreman leading the descent as 'captain', and setting a maximum speed. At times cavalcades of up to two hundred cars would descend in close procession.|$|E
60|$|We had {{not long}} to wait. The very next train roared from the tunnel as before, but slowed in the open, and then, with a {{creaking}} of <b>brakes,</b> <b>pulled</b> up immediately beneath us. It was not four {{feet from the}} window-ledge {{to the roof of}} the carriages. Holmes softly closed the window.|$|R

50|$|On the road, the tester advised, the new Morris Minor S.V. {{exceeded}} 50 mph. A {{certain amount}} of wheel-bounce consumed {{a lot of power}} when testing standing-start times. The tappets could have been adjusted more finely, the accelerator needs a steadier spring and there should be a rest pedal beside it. Speed and brake levers were rather distant, top speed was apt to jump out when the load came off, some wheel bounce and movement with such a short wheelbase is acceptable, the foot <b>brakes</b> <b>pulled</b> to the near-side.|$|R
50|$|The runaway {{cars had}} {{travelled}} {{for almost three}} kilometres before they ploughed into the incoming express, and the speed was probably around 60 km/h. The express train was moving at 70-75 km/h, {{in spite of its}} emergency <b>brake</b> being <b>pulled</b> in the seconds before the collision.|$|R
60|$|Bonamy {{crossed to}} the window. Pickford's van swung down the street. The omnibuses were locked {{together}} at Mudie's corner. Engines throbbed, and carters, jamming the <b>brakes</b> down, <b>pulled</b> their horses sharp up. A harsh and unhappy voice cried something unintelligible. And then suddenly all the leaves seemed to raise themselves.|$|R
50|$|The {{chain brake}} is principally {{operated}} by the top-hand guard being pushed forward to engage the <b>brake,</b> and <b>pulled</b> back to disengage. The spring-loaded action allows powerful braking under emergency conditions and can halt a chain under full power in {{a fraction of a}} second. Correspondingly, it may require considerable force to reset.|$|R
5000|$|School buses {{which are}} {{equipped}} with a hydraulic brake system will have a hand brake lever {{to the left of}} the driver (in left hand drive buses) near the floor. It is operated by pushing the lever down with one's hand to apply the <b>brake,</b> and <b>pulling</b> it upwards to release it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was at the}} window, looking out, {{when you}} came," [...] she said. [...] "It {{followed}} you out from the Square into this street.

50|$|The {{emergency}} <b>brake</b> was <b>pulled,</b> and {{the train}} {{came to a stop}} a thousand or so meters from the blast, 8 kilometers from the northern entrance and 10 from the southern. Train conductor Gian Claudio Bianconcini - on his last journey before retiring - was wounded in the nape of his neck, but managed to reach a service telephone and call for help. Passengers were scared and stranded in the cold Apennines' winter.|$|R
50|$|The Swift Folder is also {{designed}} to work with 20 inch 451mm wheels. The linear <b>pull</b> <b>brakes</b> that come standard with the Swift will not work with 451s. The frame is {{designed to work}} with Caliper brakes with the larger wheels.|$|R
25|$|This type of brake pre-dates the direct-pull brake. It is a centre-pull {{cantilever}} {{design with}} an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side, a cable {{stop on the}} frame or fork to terminate the cable housing, and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes. The cable from the <b>brake</b> lever <b>pulls</b> upwards on the straddle cable, causing the brake arms to rotate up and inward thus squeezing the rim between the brake pads.|$|R
40|$|Suspension {{system is}} one of the most {{important}} subsystems in any automobile. An ideal system serves the occupant with comfort, minimal road disturbance, and thedriver with steer control and maneuverability. In the process of developing an ideal system, all the existing suspension systemsare reviewed by Pro-con analysis method, and McPherson suspension system is drawnout as most suitable system for Uniti car, as worked out from Pugh’s decision matrix. House of Quality is built to list out and prioritize technical specifications, userrequirements/ expectations for L 7 e car’s suspension. Quality Function Deploymentalso helped us to evaluate competitor strengths and weaknesses. The results obtainedfrom QFD is used as database to modify the existing predesigned McPhersonsuspension template that is available in ADAMS/Car 2015. 1. 0. Once the system wasmodified in the way it could fit the dimensions of Uniti car, it is tested and simulatedon test rig, whose results were out in the form of graphical plots between variousimportant suspension parameters. Parallel wheel travel, Opposite wheel travel, and <b>Brake</b> <b>pull</b> analysis are thetests conducted during simulation, whose results reveals that the modified suspensionsystem works efficiently for maximum working load and is stable on road to maneuvers. ...|$|R
5000|$|Cyclocross Cantilever brake bosses {{are more}} often {{equipped}} with traditional center-pull cantilever brakes than the more contemporary and powerful linear-pull brakes ("V-brakes") due to two reasons: native compatibility (insufficient <b>brake</b> cable <b>pull)</b> {{with the majority of}} drop-bar brake levers; and the cantilever brake's greater brake pad-to-rim clearance, which minimizes drag in muddy conditions. [...] "Mini-V's" [...] are gaining in popularity as they have both the native cable pull, and some of the increased power of traditional linear-pull brakes over cantilever brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The 152 is also {{fitted with}} a parking brake system. It is applied by {{depressing}} both toe <b>brakes</b> and then <b>pulling</b> the [...] "Park Brake" [...] lever to the pilot’s left. The toe brakes are then released but pressure is maintained in the system thereby leaving both brakes engaged.|$|R
50|$|The bus {{was being}} driven along Sea Lane in Ingoldmells, {{close to the}} Fantasy Island {{amusement}} park, {{at the time of}} the accident. Immediately prior to the accident, driver Stephen Topasna pulled the bus into a bus stop in a lay-by by the side of the road in order to pick up passengers. The accident occurred as Topasna accelerated the bus away from the lay-by; due to pedal confusion, Topasna unintentionally caused the bus to accelerate instead of <b>brake</b> after <b>pulling</b> back into the road, leading to a loss of control.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigators}} {{then turned}} to an older interview with Saulin {{and looked at the}} record more closely than before. After the <b>brake</b> was <b>pulled,</b> Saulin went {{to the rear of the}} first car to pull the reset handle, but the handle was sluggish and refused to move. Having been overlooked previously, it was discovered that Saulin had placed his hand on the main brake pipe valve to get more leverage to pull the reset handle. When Saulin finally pulled the handle, the investigators surmise, he must have also accidentally closed the valve.|$|R
50|$|Unlike adult bikes, children's trikes do {{not always}} have {{pneumatic}} tires, having instead wheels of solid rubber or hollow plastic. While this may add to {{the weight of the}} tricycle and reduces the shock-absorbing qualities, it eliminates the possibility of punctures. <b>Pull</b> <b>brakes</b> are rarely fitted to front-drive trikes, but the child can slow the trike down by resisting the forward motion through the pedals.|$|R
50|$|On Monday, 30 July 1973 {{the winding}} engine man noticed some sparks under the brake {{cylinder}} {{when he started}} to retard the winding. He immediately increased regenerative <b>braking</b> and simultaneously <b>pulled</b> the <b>brake</b> lever to ON position. As there was no effect, he pressed the emergency stop button. This too had no effect and the cage crashed the bottom wooden landing baulks with enormous force which killed 18 and seriously injured 11 people.|$|R
60|$|Miriam was {{somewhat}} scared by the wind, but the lads enjoyed it. They went on, miles and miles, to Whatstandwell. All {{the food was}} eaten, everybody was hungry, and {{there was very little}} money to get home with. But they managed to procure a loaf and a currant-loaf, which they hacked to pieces with shut-knives, and ate sitting on the wall near the bridge, watching the bright Derwent rushing by, and the <b>brakes</b> from Matlock <b>pulling</b> up at the inn.|$|R
50|$|Restart after a {{shutdown}} {{required the}} assistance of the parks' maintenance staff. One person would go to the manual brake release under the C brake while the other ran the control panel brake in the house. One train would be taken {{to the top of the}} lift and stopped. The second train would be stopped at the C brake before the second inverted loop. The third train would be in the house. To start the process, the C <b>brake</b> was <b>pulled</b> to release the train for the second loop. The lift train would be released as soon as the C block train was clear of the brake. Once the lift train cleared the house train was released. This was done several times during the first year of operation until the ride was reduced to two trains.|$|R
25|$|Such fears proved unfounded, as Noda {{qualified}} {{within a}} second of Comas' time, {{and was the}} 25th fastest. But when David Brabham's best time in the Simtek was disallowed, Noda was bumped up to 24th on the grid, alongside Comas in 23rd. But in another department, he had comprehensively thrashed his more experienced teammate. Under <b>braking,</b> he was <b>pulling</b> 4.1g, a Larrousse record, whereas Comas often pulled less than 3g. It showed how quickly he had got the hang of powerful Formula One brakes.|$|R
25|$|Large {{vehicles}} are usually fitted with power operated or power assisted parking brakes. Power assisted parking brakes are usually found on large vans {{as well as}} some older heavy vehicles. These operate {{in the same way as}} a conventional parking <b>brakes,</b> but <b>pulling</b> the lever operates a valve that allows air or hydraulic pressure or vacuum into a cylinder which applies force to the brake shoes and makes applying the parking brake easier. When releasing the parking brake, the same mechanism also provides assistance to the driver in disengaging the ratchet. Particularly on commercial vehicles with air operated brakes, this has the added benefit of making it much harder or even impossible to release the parking brake when insufficient air pressure is available to operate the brakes. A reservoir or accumulator is usually provided so a limited amount of power assistance is available with the engine off.|$|R
5000|$|Jim Darcy, {{the pilot}} of an X-15 rocket-powered {{research}} aircraft, and his wife, Linda, become trapped 10 seconds ahead of their time, enabling them to watch time unfold {{to catch up with}} them at the rate of about one second every 30 minutes. In the time left before returning to synch with normal time, they see that their daughter, Janie, is about to be hit by a rolling military truck whose parking brake had not been set. Jim and Linda's inability to move objects in the [...] "real" [...] world prevents them from resetting the truck's parking <b>brake</b> or <b>pulling</b> young Janie out of danger.

5000|$|Mondia {{manufactured}} {{at least}} two other, less common cyclo-cross and criterium frames. One, known as the [...] "Criterium" [...] was available in the early 1970s; the second model, designed for criterium racing and called the [...] "Criterium Prestige" [...] was manufactured {{for about two years}} in the late 1970s. The Prestige appeared to combine selected design and technical features of the Mondia Super and Special. The cyclo-cross model featured the trademark fade paint and cantilever center <b>pull</b> <b>brakes</b> mounted on studs brazed to the stays and fork of a Reynolds 531 frame.|$|R
50|$|The {{single cable}} from the handlebar's rear brake lever divides into two cables which are routed to {{opposite}} sides of the stem or fork steer tube and into cable stops. The inner cables connect to metal tabs on a disc attached to the upper side of a thrust bearing placed around the stem or steer tube. Squeezing the <b>brake</b> lever <b>pulls</b> the inner cables and causes the bearing assembly to rise. A second disc is attached {{to the bottom of the}} thrust bearing such that the entire assembly moves together up and down the steering axis while each disc can rotate independently around the axis. A second set of cables are attached to tabs on this lower disc and pass through cable stops mounted on the either side of the head tube. The two lower cables merge back into one and then are routed to the rear brake. The cables are split in this way to ensure that the detangler mechanism moves equally on both sides.|$|R
50|$|Pulling {{the alarm}} chain on a British train will pull a lever {{connected}} to the <b>brake</b> pipe flaps. <b>Pulling</b> the alarm activates a piston, causing the flaps to be opened and all the air pushed out the air tube, forcing the brakes on. In the driver's cab, a buzzer and a light will tell that the alarm has been activated. In the guard's van, this is seen from a valve which shows loss of pressure in the brake pipe. In the UK, there is a fine of £80 for pulling the alarm chain without good reason.|$|R
5000|$|Whatstandwell is {{mentioned}} in the D H Lawrence novel Sons and Lovers, published 1913, in {{a scene in which}} Paul Morel and Miriam go on a day's outing: [...] "They went on, miles and miles, to Whatstandwell.

5000|$|... "After takeoff {{and climb}} to {{altitude}} {{we saw the}} entire sky was filled with moving dots. We dropped our tanks and hit the throttles, and our MiGs went into combat. Immediately the regiment broke up into several groups and pairs. I and my six were following the group commander’s flight, which were attacking a group of Sabres flying an intersecting course from below the Sabres. At that moment his group found itself under attack from a flight of Sabres. I gave the command to my wingman to repulse the attack, and we proceeded to cut through their flight. A long burst {{in front of the}} Sabres forced them to break off the attack and climb away. I gave the command to Lazutin to go after them, while I and my wingman turned to follow the group commander, who had opened fire as he closed on the Sabres, but they made a sharp maneuver to avoid his fire and split up. One flight went into steep left bank, and the other did the same to the right. Vishnyakov’s flight split up as well and began to go after both groups as pairs. At that moment his pair was jumped from above by a pair of Sabres, who literally popped up about 300-400 meters from me. I immediately went over to get on their tails. The Sabres rolled over and went into a dive. I ordered Gogolev, my third pair leader, “Cover the commander,” and tried to go after the Sabres. I could see that the Sabres were holding a dive at an angle of about 60 degrees - I aimed at them and immediately gave one of them a burst. I saw the shells detonate {{in the area of the}} cockpit, and there was clearly black smoke now visible inside the cockpit; the Sabre’s dive angle increased and he kept ongoing down. At that moment, Gulyy called me:-I’m spinning! I looked behind me and saw his aircraft nearly inverted. I gave the command: -Hit your air <b>brakes!</b> <b>Pull</b> out!I saw Gulyy pull out of the inverted position and we then went into a dive, climbed back up to altitude, and returned home. ...Fifty years later a special group carrying out a search for American pilots who were missing in action asked me if the pilot of the Sabre I shot down had bailed out. I could only repeat what I wrote above.” ...|$|R
50|$|With {{adjustable}} +/- trailer braking gain in {{a digital}} readout from 0.0 (no trailer brakes) to 10.0 (full trailer braking) in 0.5 increments and a manual override lever (to test trailer braking action), the Ford 'built into the dash' TBC provides smooth <b>braking</b> even when <b>pulling</b> up to a 15,000 lb 4-axle conventional (receiver mounted) or 26,000 lb 4-axle 5th Wheel (bed/frame mounted) trailer. TowCommand being different from most aftermarket TBCs, ties into the trucks' computer and hydraulics, so it senses truck brake pressure and can apply trailer brakes {{as fast as the}} truck's brakes. Master Brake Systems 'BrakeSmart' TBC is the only other TBC that taps into the trucks hydraulic lines in modern trucks.|$|R
50|$|The next {{evolution}} on {{the foil}} kites for traction activities was {{the development of}} the 4-line foil kite. While 2-line kites require sometimes significant push and pull arm movement to fly (especially true the larger the kite), {{the development of the}} 4-line kite required less arm movement. 4-line kites are flown with two lines on each handle: a top line (or power line), and a bottom line (or brake line). 4-line kites can still be flown with push and pull arm movement, but if the bottom <b>brake</b> line is <b>pulled</b> in the bottom edge of the kite stalls and will cause the kite to turn on that bottom edge. This results in tighter turns with less arm movement - this is important if sitting in a kite buggy.|$|R
5000|$|In 2015, {{the revolutionary}} rollerski with disc-brakes {{controlled}} remotely from your pole from RollerSafe.no were released.

50|$|On 11 May 1944, {{four people}} killed. A goods train {{ran into the}} rear of a halted troop train at Copley, 604 km north of Adelaide, {{telescoping}} the rear cars and resulting in 4 deaths and 27 injuries. The troop train, consisting of 16 carriages, 4 fully laden goods trucks and a <b>brake</b> van, was <b>pulled</b> by a T class loco. However, the consist was too heavy for the loco, and it had problems with its injectors after climbing a steep hill. The loco was low on water, and uncoupled from the train to 'run light' to the nearest watering spot and refill. While it was away, the goods train entered the same section of track and struck {{the rear of the}} troop train. Only the fact that many troops were lying down saved them from serious injury and decapitation, as the tops of several carriages were shorn off in the impact.|$|R
2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the <b>braking</b> surface, then <b>pulls</b> the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. Floating caliper (single piston) designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|R
40|$|Sublaminar wires {{have been}} used for many years for {{segmental}} spinal instrumentation in scoliosis surgery. More recently, stainless steel wires have been replaced by titanium cables. However, in rigid scoliotic curves, sublaminar wires or simple cables can either <b>brake</b> or <b>pull</b> out. The square-lashing technique was devised to avoid complications such as cable breakage or lamina cutout. The {{purpose of the study was}} therefore to test biomechanically the pull out and failure mode of simple sublaminar constructs versus the square-lashing technique. Individual vertebrae were subjected to pullout testing having one of two different constructs (single loop and square lashing) using either monofilament wire or multifilament cables. Four different methods of fixation were therefore tested: single wire construct, square-lashing wiring construct, single cable construct, and square-lashing cable construct. Ultimate failure load and failure mechanism were recorded. For the single wire the construct failed 12 / 16 times by wire breakage with an average ultimate failure load of 793  N. For the square-lashing wire the construct failed with pedicle fracture in 14 / 16, one bilateral lamina fracture, and one wire breakage. Ultimate failure load average was 1, 239  N For the single cable the construct failed 12 / 16 times due to cable breakage (average force 1, 162  N). 10 / 12 of these breakages were where the cable looped over the rod. For the square-lashing cable all of these constructs (16 / 16) failed by fracture of the pedicle with an average ultimate failure load of 1, 388  N. The square-lashing construct had a higher pullout strength than the single loop and almost no cutting out from the lamina. The square-lashing technique with cables may therefore represent a new advance in segmental spinal instrumentation...|$|R
25|$|All DT3 {{units are}} {{equipped}} with passenger intercom panels near every door {{in addition to the}} standard emergency brakes and emergency door release handles. Controllers can access CCTV cameras in every unit from the control centre through a Wireless LAN link installed in all tunnels that are used by DT3 trains. Flame-retardant materials are used wherever possible. Temperature sensors and smoke detectors are spread throughout every unit in the passenger space and in every underfloor machinery compartment to detect possible fires as early as possible. Circuit integrity retaining electrical cables (cables that can keep their insulation for a certain time in the presence of fire) are used to allow a unit to proceed to the next station in case of a fire. German regulations mandate that all subway trains must not stop inside a tunnel after the emergency <b>brake</b> has been <b>pulled</b> or if any other hazard like a fire is detected, but instead should proceed to the next station if possible to ease rescue operations. Since the longest travel time between two stations on the Nuremberg U-Bahn is about 3 Minutes (between Ziegelstein and Flughafen) and most stations are less than 60 seconds apart, this is deemed a superior option to stopping inside a tunnel, where evacuation, rescue and firefighting attempts would be much more difficult than on a station platform.|$|R
