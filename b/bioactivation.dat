50|$|Most toxic {{substances}} exert their toxicity through some interaction (e.g., covalent bonding, oxidation) with cellular macromolecules like proteins or DNA. This interaction leads {{to changes in}} the normal cellular biochemistry and physiology and downstream toxic effects.Occasionally, the toxicophore requires <b>bioactivation,</b> mediated by enzymes, to produce a more reactive metabolite that is more toxic. For example, tobacco-specific nitrosamines are activated by cytochrome P450 enzymes to form a more reactive substance that can covalently bind to DNA, causing mutations that, if not repaired, can lead to cancer. Generally, different chemical compounds that contain the same toxicophore elicit similar toxic effects at the same site of toxicity.|$|E
50|$|Once {{azinphos-methyl}} {{is absorbed}} {{it can cause}} neurotoxic effects, like other organophosphate insecticides. At high concentrations AzM itself can be toxic because it can function as a acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitor. But its toxicity is mainly due to the <b>bioactivation</b> by a cytochrome P450 (CYP450)-mediated desulfuration to its phosphate triester or oxon(gutoxon) (see figure 2). Gutoxon can react with a serine hydroxyl group at the active site of the AChE. The active site is then blocked and AChE is inactivated. Under normal circumstances acetylcholinesterase rapidly and efficiently degrades the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) and thereby terminates the biological activity of acetylcholine. Inhibition of AChE results in an immediate accumulation of free unbound ACh at the ending of all cholinergic nerves, which leads to overstimulation of the nervous system.|$|E

[...] Next to oxidation of the furan ring of 4-IPO, so that the 4-IPO enedial is formed, the hydroxyl group of 4-IPO can be oxidized. Oxidation of this functional group leads to ketone formation, so IPN is formed. IPN can undergo oxidation of the furan ring by CYPs, like 4-IPO. After this <b>bioactivation</b> reaction, the product can be conjugated to glutathione (GSH) by glutathione-S-transferase (GST).

5000|$|Recent {{evidence}} suggests that spontaneous cycloaromatization of kedarcidin chromophore is competitive with nucleophilic <b>bioactivation,</b> if not the predominant mechanism in vivo. While MM2 calculations show that the C1-C12 double bond in the bicyclic core imparts {{a considerable amount of}} ring strain (ca. 14 kcal·mol−1) to the 6,5,5 tricycle formed upon Bergman cyclization-reduction, Hirama et al. note that the 5,9-fused enediyne core is susceptible to cycloaromatization-reduction in the absence of both thiol [...] "activating agents" [...] and (non-solvent) hydrogen donors. The kedarcidin chromophore aglycone similarly undergoes reductive cycloaromatization at comparable rates irrespective of the presence of β-mercaptoethanol, a common thiol reductant. In a model system, {{it was found that the}} 5,9-bicyclic core of kedarcidin chromophore exists in equilibrium with the corresponding 5,5,6-tricyclic cycloaromatized biradical. The rate of pseudo-first-order decay of this model enediyne is highly dependent on the solvent hydrogen-donor ability, indicating that the hydrogen abstraction step following biradical formation is kinetically significant in the cycloaromatization of the enediyne, as opposed to acyclic systems, where formation of the biradical itself is known to be the rate-limiting step. It is noteworthy that of the solvents examined, tetrahydrofuran—structurally homologous with deoxyribose—led to comparatively fast decomposition of the 5,9-fused enediyne scaffold (t½ = 68 min); Zein et al. independently remark that deoxyribose 4'-hydrogen abstraction is most likely operative in kedarcidin chromophore bioactivity.|$|E

Importantly, prodrugs can belong to multiple subtypes (i.e., Mixed-Type). A Mixed-Type prodrug {{is one that is}} bioactivated at multiple sites, either in parallel or sequential steps.

40|$|Aims: Oxidative <b>bioactivation</b> of {{amodiaquine}} (AQ) by cytochrome P 450 s to a reactive quinoneimine {{is considered}} {{as an important}} mechanism underlying its idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity. However, because internal exposure to its major metabolite N-desethylamodiaquine (DEAQ) is up to 240 -fold higher than AQ, <b>bioactivation</b> of DEAQ might significantly contribute to covalent binding. The aim {{of the present study}} was to compare the kinetics of <b>bioactivation</b> of AQ and DEAQ by human liver microsomes (HLM) and to characterize the CYPs involved in <b>bioactivation</b> of AQ and DEAQ. Methods: Glutathione was used to trap reactive metabolites formed in incubations of AQ and DEAQ with HLM and recombinant human cytochrome P 450 s (hCYPs). Kinetics of <b>bioactivation</b> of AQ and DEAQ in HLM and involvement of hCYPs were characterized by measuring corresponding glutathione conjugates (AQ-SG and DEAQ-SG) using a high-performance liquid chromatography method. Results: <b>Bioactivation</b> of AQ and DEAQ in HLM both exhibited Michaelis–Menten kinetics. For AQ <b>bioactivation,</b> enzyme kinetical parameters were Km, 11. 5  ±  2. 0  μmol l– 1, Vmax, 59. 2  ±  3. 2  pmol min− 1  mg− 1 and CLint, 5. 15  μl min− 1  mg− 1. For DEAQ, parameters for <b>bioactivation</b> were Km, 6. 1  ±  1. 3  μmol l– 1, Vmax, 5. 5  ±  0. 4  pmol min− 1  mg− 1 and CLint 0. 90  μl min− 1  mg− 1.

Enzyme kinetical characterization of these P 450 s showed comparable intrinsic clearance of <b>bioactivation,</b> implicating that CYP 3 A 4 would be more important because of its higher hepatic expression, compared with CYP 2 D 6. Inhibition experiments using pooled human liver microsomes confirmed the major role of CYP 3 A 4 in hepatic <b>bioactivation</b> of clozapine. By studying <b>bioactivation</b> of clozapine in human liver microsomes from 100 different individuals, an 8 -fold variability in <b>bioactivation</b> activity was observed.
