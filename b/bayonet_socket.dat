The wheel-lug wrench served as a handle (also for the jack) and the jack shaft with bayonet-coupling pins could be inserted through a small hole in the grille to engage a <b>bayonet</b> <b>socket</b> on the forward end of the engine crankshaft. A quick-and-easy twist of the handle was sufficient to start the flat head V8, and the bayonet coupling was self-disengaging for safety.|$|E

It was rechambered to the standard German 7.92×57 IS cartridge with a fully enclosed flush magazine, the bolt handle was made angled, the <b>bayonet</b> <b>socket</b> was changed to accept German bayonets and some alterations was made to the sling mount. In addition, the rifle was adopted to use standard Mauser 5-round charger clips and its sights were recalibrated to match the ballistics of the 7.92mm IS cartridge.|$|E

50|$|The <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> had by then {{been adopted}} by most European armies. The British <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> had a {{triangular}} blade with a flat side towards the muzzle and two fluted sides outermost to a length of 15 inches (38 cm). However it had no lock to keep it fast to the muzzle and was well-documented for falling off {{in the heat of}} battle.|$|R
50|$|The current British L3A1 <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> {{is based}} on the FN FAL Type C <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> with a clip-point blade. It has a hollow handle that fits over the SA80/L85 rifles muzzle and slots that lined up with those on the flash eliminator. The blade is offset {{to the side of the}} handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade. It can also be used as a {{multi-purpose}} knife and wire-cutter when combined with its scabbard. The scabbard also has a sharpening stone and folding saw blade.|$|R
50|$|Mackay was the {{inventor}} of the <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> which soon came into general use, the idea being suggested to him by the failure of the plug bayonet to stop the rush of the Highlanders at the Battle of Killiecrankie.|$|R
50|$|There {{are also}} {{adapters}} between screw sizes, and for adapting {{to or from}} <b>bayonet</b> caps. A <b>socket</b> extender makes the bulb stick out further, such as to accommodate a compact fluorescent lamp with a self-ballast that doesn't fit in a recessed lighting fixture.|$|R
5000|$|Modern knife bayonets have 6 inch to 9 {{inch long}} and [...]75 inch to 1.5 inch wide blades, {{and are often}} fullered. They have been {{tempered}} for durability {{so as not to}} break when twisting; this was often the problem with long and slender <b>socket</b> <b>bayonets.</b> Like sword bayonets, they can be used not only for thrusting, but also for cutting.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the other}} two weapons, {{there is very little}} {{difference}} between an electric sabre and a steam or dry (non-electric) one. The blade itself is the same in steam and electric sabres, as {{there is no need for}} a blade wire or pressure-sensitive tip in an electric sabre. An electric sabre has a socket, which is generally a 2-prong or <b>bayonet</b> foil <b>socket</b> with the two contacts shorted together. The electric sabre also has insulation on the pommel and on the inside of the guard to prevent an electrical connection between the sabre and the lamé. This is undesirable because it effectively extends the lamé onto the sabre, causing any blade contact to be registered as a valid touch.|$|R
5000|$|The 19th century {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the sword bayonet, a long-bladed weapon with a single- or double-edged blade that could also be used as a shortsword. Its initial purpose was to ensure that riflemen could form an infantry square properly to fend off cavalry attacks when in ranks with musketmen, whose weapons were longer. A prime early example of a sword bayonet-fitted rifle is the British Infantry Rifle of 1800-1840, later known as the [...] "Baker Rifle" [...] (to this day, no matter what length of the bayonet, British rifle regiments [...] "fix swords"). The hilt usually had quillons modified to accommodate the gun barrel and a hilt mechanism that enabled the bayonet to be attached to a bayonet lug. A sword bayonet could be used in combat as a side arm. When attached to the musket or rifle, it effectively turned almost any long gun into a spear or glaive, suitable not only for thrusting but also for slashing.While the British Army eventually discarded the sword <b>bayonet,</b> the <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> survived the introduction of the rifled musket into British service in 1854. The new rifled musket copied the French locking ring system. The new bayonet proved its worth at the Battle of Alma and the Battle of Inkerman during the Crimean War, where the Imperial Russian Army learned to fear it.|$|R
50|$|The FN FAL has {{two types}} of bayonets. The first is a {{traditional}} spear point bayonet. The second is the Type C <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> introduced in the 1960s. It has a hollow handle that fits over the muzzle and slots that lined up with those on the FALs 22 mm NATO-spec flash hider. Its spear-type blade is offset {{to the side of}} the handle to allow the bullet to pass beside the blade.|$|R
5000|$|With {{the advent}} of the <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet,</b> the pike {{was in the process of}} being phased out as {{infantry}} could now adequately defend themselves from cavalry without sacrificing firepower per man. The Russian Army used the bayonet frequently during the Napoleonic wars. A Russian tactical precept coined by Russian General Alexander Suvorov was [...] "The bullet is foolish, the bayonet wise". Given Russia's often inadequately trained conscript armies and use of inaccurate smooth-bore muskets, Russian officers preferred to use the bayonet charge instead of musket volley fire where possible.|$|R
50|$|In the Prussian Army of 1870, Infantry Regiments 33 to 40 plus Regiments 73 (Hanover), 80 (Hesse-Kassel or Hesse-Cassel) and 86 (Schleswig-Holstein) {{were all}} {{designated}} as fusiliers, {{as was the}} Guard Fusilier Regiment. In addition the third battalions of all Guard, Grenadier and Line infantry regiments retained the designation 'Fusilier Battalion'. They were armed with a slightly shorter version of the Dreyse Rifle (Füsiliergewehr), that took a sword bayonet (Füsilier-Seitengewehr) rather than the standard <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet.</b> Although still theoretically skirmishers, in practice they differed little from their compatriots, as all Prussian infantry fought in a style that formed a dense 'firing' or 'skirmish' line.|$|R
50|$|The main weapon {{used by the}} British {{forces in}} the 1860s was the Pattern 1853 Enfield. Properly {{described}} as a rifled musket, it was loaded down the barrel like a conventional musket but the barrel was rifled. While muskets were accurate to about 60-80 m, an 1853 Enfield was accurate to about 300 m to 400 m {{in the hands of}} an experienced soldier; at 100 m an experienced soldier could easily hit a human target. The rifle was 1.44 m long, weighed 4 kg and had a 53 cm <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet.</b> This rifle was also commonly used in the American Civil War by both sides.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the lug's invention, bayonets merely {{stuffed into}} the muzzle's end from a tight-fitting stub, {{rendering}} the firearm virtually useless and certainly preventing {{it from being}} discharged. But by the late 17th century, this type of bayonet was entirely phased out and subsequently replaced with the <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet,</b> that slides over the muzzle with the blade offset to the side, just above or underneath. Bayonet lugs are usually located near the muzzle end of a musket, rifle, or other longarm barrel. The lug is occasionally placed {{on top of the}} barrel, if serving as the base of the front sight, or more often mounted to the side or bottom of the barrel.|$|R
50|$|One {{technical}} {{problem the}} armorers {{and the director}} {{had to deal with}} concerned the rifles used during the filming. The company was unable to obtain enough Martini-Henry rifles to equip all of the extras, and had to fill in with No.1 Mark IV Enfields disguised with <b>socket</b> <b>bayonets</b> as used on the Martini-Henrys. In the scene at 1:37:30 where Chard orders a walking advance and volley fire by ranks, the cocking pieces can be seen moving forward as the men shoot, and one kneeling man can even be seen working the bolt on his rifle. Generally, in any scene shot from the soldiers' left, the rifles being used are Enfields; in any scene shot from the right, Martini-Henrys.|$|R
5000|$|The Board of Ordnance, both {{of its own}} {{volition}} and {{at the behest of}} Infantry Staff Officers, ordered production modifications during the rifle's service life. Variations included a carbine with a safety catch and swivel-mounted ramrod, the 1801 pattern West India Rifle (a simplified version lacking a patchbox), the 1809 pattern, which was [...]75 (musket) calibre, and the 1800/15, which was modified from existing stocks to use a <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet.</b> The most common field modification was the bent stock: riflemen in the field found that the stock was not bent sufficiently at the wrist to allow accurate firing, so stocks were bent by steaming. As this technique produces temporary results (lasting approximately five years), no examples found today exhibit this bend.|$|R
50|$|The {{model of}} 1870, or Berdan II, is a single-shot bolt-action with a {{distinctive}} short, pear-shaped bolt handle. The bolt handle {{serves as the}} only locking lug for the action, and when closed, points upwards at a 30-degree angle, rather than horizontally. The Berdan II was produced in four variants: an infantry rifle, the lighter and slightly shorter dragoon rifle, a Cossack rifle with a button trigger and no trigger guard, and a cavalry carbine. Infantry and dragoon rifles were issued with quadrangular <b>socket</b> <b>bayonets.</b> Initial production of the Berdan II was at Birmingham Small Arms in England. The rifles were later manufactured in large numbers by Russian factories at Tula, Izhevsk, and Sestroretsk. Estimated total production of all models is over 3 million. The rifle was known for its accuracy, simplicity and reliability.|$|R
5000|$|Early bayonets {{were of the}} [...] "plug" [...] type. This allowed light {{infantry}} to {{be converted}} to heavy infantry and hold off cavalry charges. The bayonet had a round handle that slid directly into the musket barrel. This naturally prevented the gun from being fired. In 1671, plug bayonets were issued to the French regiment of fusiliers then raised. They were issued to part of an English dragoon regiment raised in 1672 and disbanded in 1674, and to the Royal Fusiliers when raised in 1685. The danger incurred {{by the use of}} this bayonet (which put a stop to all fire) was felt so early that the younger Puységur invented a <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> in 1678 that fitted over the muzzle using a circular band of metal, allowing the musket to be loaded and fired. However, it was not widely adopted at the time.|$|R
50|$|An {{unsuccessful}} {{trial with}} <b>socket</b> or zigzag <b>bayonets</b> was made {{after the battle}} of Fleurus in 1690, {{in the presence of}} King Louis XIV, who refused to adopt them, as they had a tendency to fall off the musket. Shortly after the Peace of Ryswick (1697), the English and Germans abolished the pike and introduced ring bayonets; and pictures of them are shown in Surirey de St. Remy's Mémoires d'Artillerie, published in Paris in that year. In 1703, the French infantry adopted spring-loaded locking system that prevented the bayonet from accidentally separating from the musket. Henceforward, the <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> became, with the musket or other firearm, the typical weapon of the French infantry. A triangular blade was introduced around 1715 and was stronger than the previous single or double-edged models, creating wounds which were harder to treat due to the propensity of healing scar tissue to pull apart the triangular incision.|$|R

50|$|The Ottoman {{military}} {{was capable of}} matching those of its European rivals {{during the first half}} of the eighteenth century, and there was no significant technological gap between them. However, following the 1739 Treaty of Belgrade, the Ottomans remained at peace in Europe for nearly thirty years, missing out on the rapid improvements in military technology and organization associated with the Seven Years' War (1756-63), particularly the development of highly trained and disciplined regimental forces, innovations in the tactical deployment of small-caliber cannons, and the widespread use of <b>socket</b> <b>bayonets</b> as a counter to cavalry. Extended peace also resulted in a lack of practical experience among Ottoman commanders, in contrast with Russian generals such as Rumiantsev and Suvarov, whose abilities were honed during the Seven Years' War. Thus when war finally broke out with Russia in 1768 the Ottomans suffered devastating defeats, resulting in the loss of Crimea and the signing of the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca in 1774.|$|R

Governor Moore’s insurgents had seized these accurate weapons, among the best in service at the time, from the Federal Arsenal at Baton Rouge in January 1861. To offset their absence of bayonets, the Tigers were either issued or brought along their own Bowie-style knife or ship cutlasses, implements which were described as “murderous-looking…with heavy blades…twenty inches long with double edged points…and solid long handles.” ...|$|R
5000|$|During the 1850s, in a {{technological}} revolution of major proportions, the rifle musket began {{to replace the}} relatively inaccurate smoothbore musket in ever-increasing numbers, both in Europe and America. This process, accelerated by the Civil War, ensured that the rifled shoulder weapon would be the basic weapon used by infantrymen in both the Federal and Confederate armies.The standard and most common shoulder weapon used in the American Civil War was the Springfield [...]58‑caliber rifle musket, models 1855, 1861, and 1863. In 1855, the US Army adopted this weapon to replace the.69‑caliber smoothbore musket and the [...]54‑caliber rifle. In appearance, the rifle musket {{was similar to the}} smoothbore musket. Both were single‑shot muzzleloaders, but the rifled bore of the new weapon substantially increased its range and accuracy. The rifling system chosen by the United States was designed by Claude Minié, a French Army officer. Whereas earlier rifles fired a round nonexpanding ball, the Minié system used a hollow‑based cylindro‑conoidal projectile slightly smaller than the bore that dropped easily into the barrel. When the powder charge was ignited by a fulminate of mercury percussion cap, the released powder gases expanded the base of the bullet into the rifled grooves, giving the projectile a ballistic spin.The model 1855 Springfield rifle musket was the first regulation arm to use the hollow‑base [...]58‑caliber minie bullet. The slightly modified model 1861 was the principal infantry weapon of the Civil War, although two subsequent models in 1863 were produced in about equal quantities. The model 1861 was 56 inches long overall, had a 40‑inch barrel, and weighed 9 pounds 2 ounces with its <b>bayonet.</b> The 21-inch <b>socket</b> <b>bayonet</b> consisted of an 18‑inch triangular blade and 3‑inch socket. The Springfield had a rear sight graduated to 500 yards. The maximum effective range of this weapon was approximately 500 yards, although it had killing power at 1,000 yards. The round could penetrate 11 inches of white-pine board at 200 yards and 3¼ inches at 1,000 yards, with a penetration of 1 inch considered the equivalent of disabling a human being. Although the new weapons had increased accuracy and effectiveness, the soldiers’ vision was still obscured by the clouds of smoke produced by the rifle musket’s black powder propellant.|$|R

50|$|Most {{infantry}} would routinely keep bayonets {{fixed to}} their inaccurate smoothbore muskets throughout a battle. Close order ranks and squares presented a hedge of bayonets to the enemy, which was especially useful for deterring cavalry. But a fixed bayonet - a pound {{or so of}} extra metal {{on the front of}} a firearm - seriously affects a firearm’s balance and hampers accurate shooting. However, Mosin-Nagant rifles using cruciform and dagger bayonets were arsenal zeroed with them affixed (or extended) as they affect point-of-impact via barrel harmonics, {{and in the case of}} Imperial Russian and Soviet battle doctrine dictated they be always affixed (with few exceptions). A rifleman usually fought without a fixed bayonet since accuracy was the whole point of his rifled weapon. He therefore required a side-arm that could be drawn and used instantly in an emergency so his bayonet had a cutting edge and a grippable hilt. That such bayonets were far heavier than standard <b>socket</b> <b>bayonets</b> was not a disadvantage since they were rarely fixed.|$|R

These rifles have been referred to in various publications as being 'outmoded and out of date;' however they were comparable with other leading models of the era.

Scottish seamen received protection against arbitrary impressment, but a fixed quota of conscripts for the Royal Navy was levied from the sea-coast burghs. There were now Royal Navy patrols in Scottish waters even in peacetime. Scottish privateers played a major part in the Second Anglo-Dutch War. In the 1690s a fleet of five ships was established for the Darien Scheme, and a professional navy of three warships to protect local shipping. After the Act of Union in 1707, these vessels were transferred to the Royal Navy. At the Union, the standing army was seven units of infantry, two of horse and one troop of Horse Guards, besides varying levels of fortress artillery. As part of the British Army, Scottish regiments took part in a series of wars on the European continent. The first official Highland regiment to be raised for the British army was the Black Watch in 1740, but the growth of Highland regiments was delayed by the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion. The bulk of Jacobite armies were made up of Highlanders, serving in clan regiments. The Jacobites often started campaigns poorly armed, but arms became more conventional as the rebellions progressed.|$|R
