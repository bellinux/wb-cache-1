25|$|Talk Talk, led by singer Mark Hollis, {{formed in}} England {{in the early}} 1980s. From the start, Hollis cited jazz and impressionist artists like Miles Davis, John Coltrane, Béla Bartók and Claude Debussy as major influences. <b>But</b> <b>Talk</b> Talk's first two albums, The Party's Over (1982) and It's My Life (1984), did not readily reflect such influences; critics {{compared}} the band to contemporary new wave groups, especially Duran Duran. Hollis partly attributes the shortcomings of their early music to a financial need to use synthesizers in place of acoustic instruments.|$|E
500|$|The Rolling Stone review {{stated that}} Björk [...] " [...] for {{inspiration}} in the soundscapes of orchestral jazz, ambient techno and classical". Influences of jazz fusion were also noted by a contemporary review by The New York Times. In a 1995 interview with Pulse, Björk {{was reluctant to}} listing other female vocalists as an inspiration, stating: [...] "I've never really compared myself to other people, not because I'm too big-headed or I've got a minority complex, but because I know I just can't sing like anyone else." [...] Nevertheless, in 2015 Björk acknowledged that as she grew older, she understood [...] "that music like Kate Bush has really influenced [...]" [...] The Pulse article also read: [...] "a lot of Björk's early influences were books (George Bataille's Story of the Eye, Mikhail Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita) and films (Tampopo, Star Wars, The Tin Drum) available internationally. [...] <b>But</b> <b>talk</b> about Iceland and you're getting {{to the heart of}} the matter, the source of her spirited outlook on life." [...] In 1996, when asked about the album's musical influences, Björk stated: ...|$|E
500|$|After taking office, Lois {{attempts}} {{to propose a}} tax raise, though when this fails, begins to use fear tactics to raise funds {{to clean up the}} lake. Her efforts are successful and life returns to the clean lake. She even has leftover cash afterwards, so she embezzles $600 to purchase a purse, much to Brian's disappointment. Peter has also succumbed to the perks of being the mayor's husband: he has rerouted the town's electrical system and caused rolling blackouts to bring late comedian Jim Varney back from the dead (he does nothing <b>but</b> <b>talk,</b> playing his character Ernest, [...] and repeatedly refer to [...] "Vern".) He then remembers he actually wanted John Belushi and takes Varney outside to shoot him, only for Varney to end up taking the gun from him and Peter running away from him warning Brian. [...] Later, Lois is tempted to buy a $4,300 fur coat, and Bob Grossbeard, president of the local oil company, offers to buy it for her if she will allow him to dump his oil runoff in the lake. Lois reluctantly accepts his offer, but as the opening of the new runoff pipe begins, Lois realizes the error of her ways and closes the valve to the pipe and resigns her position as mayor, stating that she was consumed by money and power, which led her to become the very same things she set out to destroy. Lois then allows West to have his job as mayor back, but a random bystander points out that neither Lois nor Mayor West has any jurisdiction to do so, and that the city has to have a whole new election to decide who gets to be the mayor of Quahog. This prompts West to pull out a gun and shoot him, as well as two others whom he believes objected.|$|E

2500|$|The secession of Nassau and Suffolk {{counties}} on Long Island from New York {{was proposed}} {{as early as}} 1896, <b>but</b> <b>talk</b> was revived towards {{the latter part of}} the twentieth century. On March 28, 2008, Suffolk County Comptroller Joseph Sawicki proposed a plan that would make Nassau and Suffolk counties on Long Island the 51st state of the United States of America. Sawicki claimed that all of the Nassau and Suffolk taxpayers' money would remain locally, rather than the funds being dispersed all over the entire state of New York, with these counties sending to Albany over three billion dollars more than they receive back. [...] The state of Long Island would have included nearly 3 million people (a larger population than that of fifteen other states). [...] Nassau County executive Ed Mangano came out in support of such a proposal in April 2010 and commissioned a study on it.|$|E
