500|$|Dreams {{differed}} to Evermore's earlier [...] "retro-sounding, riff-based pop-rock" [...] works, {{and instead}} contained a more [...] "spacious" [...] sound according to Jon. He said he drew inspiration and {{was influenced by}} Silverchair and Muse, as well as Pink Floyd. Jon {{also noted that the}} band initially wanted to create a concept album, but stated that [...] "we sort of had to tone it back a bit, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to make a double album". Soundgenerator.com reviewer Eleanor Goodman described Dreams as [...] "clear rather than grungy, soulful rather than angsty".|$|E
500|$|Starbreeze {{intended}} for Escape from Butcher Bay to feature more complex role-playing game systems, but feedback from Diesel and game testers dissuaded them. Starbreeze senior producer Peter Wanat said, [...] "We tried {{to limit the}} number of really hard or really intricate RPG elements, and that was a choice <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> the game to be playable." [...] Other removed features include an electric bullwhip for the guard Abbott, and a 25-minute final boss fight. A PlayStation 2 version that was in development was cancelled so the company could focus on the Xbox version.|$|E
500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} Jay Worth found {{inspiration for}} the ash storyline from holding his grandmother-in-law's hands while at her funeral. He noted during production, [...] "The Ash Man definitely had {{its own set of}} challenges, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to utilize a lot of real elements, and because we didn't have the time to do all the simulation and particle work needed to make it look real. The thing that sold The Ash Man more than anything was the aftermath shot: This half-disintegrated body with a pile of ash for the head on the ground. It ended up being a layering, compositing, tweaking challenge beyond belief. I got to shoot the elements myself and had more control over them." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year France and the All Blacks {{met in the}} final of the inaugural Rugby World Cup. The tournament was co-hosted by New Zealand and Australia and the final was held at Eden Park. The All Blacks were captained by David Kirk and went on to win their first World Cup 299. According to the All Blacks' coach at the time, Brian Lochore, the previous year's loss in Nantes was the catalyst for their World Cup victory. Shelford said of the match [...] "We wanted to play them in the final <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> revenge". The match also helped improve the diplomatic and political rift between France and New Zealand caused by the 1985 bombing of the Rainbow Warrior by French Secret Service agents.|$|E
500|$|Hammerstein {{included}} an incident {{he had seen}} {{when he was a}} neophyte assistant stage manager: a chorus boy came up to a chorus girl and asked to use some of her mascara—to disguise a hole in the boy's black socks. Hammerstein stated, [...] "we were religious in keeping away from the trite things—the kindly old stage door man named Pop, the pretty little understudy who replaces the star on opening night. We steered clear, too, of the backstage story of a company putting on a new show, with all the anxieties of the actors and producers... It seemed right to focus on a show which is already running <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to tell a story about a community, the backstage community, and this community becomes settled and established after a show opens." ...|$|E
500|$|Additionally, Stapleton and Paul Tassi of Forbes both {{took issue}} to Rocksteady's {{marketing}} of the Arkham Knight as an original character, as the moniker was original but the {{character in the}} role was not. Stapleton felt {{the problem was that}} the marketing for the character indicated it was a [...] "big mystery" [...] to his identity, but any [...] "moderately knowledgeable Batman fan could reasonably" [...] deduce the identity: [...] "We all already knew who the Arkham Knight was; we were just hoping it wasn’t true <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> the original story we’d been promised." [...] Tassi criticized Rocksteady for promising a new character and insisting the identity [...] "would shock and amaze us all" [...] when it turned out to essentially be [...] "a renamed and recostumed version of a character that has already existed for years." ...|$|E

500|$|Discussing the {{progression}} from MercyMe's first album Almost There to {{the songs on}} Spoken For, [...] MercyMe's lead singer Bart Millard said in an interview: [...] "Our goal early on {{was to make sure}} our songs were 'singable' and make sure they fit on power point <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to write songs for corporate worship. Spoken For is filled with songs that I pray the church will use." [...] He added that this album leaned more toward rock than Almost There. Millard said [...] of the origin of the album title: [...] "Over the last year I’ve been consumed with the idea that God is so crazy in love with us—just knowing that we are part of something bigger and we worship a God who’s in complete control no matter how good or bad things get. The phrase [...] "spoken for" [...] really stuck with me." ...|$|E
500|$|Initial {{reception}} to {{the statue}} was very positive. [...] The New York Times {{described it as}} producing [...] "an impression of dignity, beauty, and power." [...] But in the weeks following the dedication ceremony, praise turned to criticism and reporters noted [...] "absurdities" [...] in the relief panels. [...] They noted that the relief depicting Logan gathered with other Civil War leaders plotting strategy together was very unlikely. [...] The second panel, depicting Logan being sworn in as senator by Vice President Chester A. Arthur was called [...] "impossible" [...] and [...] "ridiculous." [...] Logan was sworn into the Senate in 1879 and Arthur himself was not sworn in as vice president until 1881. [...] Two of the senators depicted in that relief were not sworn in until 1882 and 1884, respectively, and another one died in 1877. [...] Mary Logan initially took credit for selecting the scenes depicted in the reliefs and received all of the blame when the errors were discovered. [...] In a heated letter to the Evening Star, she said the reliefs were {{not meant to be}} historically accurate: [...] "Of course, we knew all this, but we disregarded it <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> these panels to portray the most prominent men {{of the history of the}} country who were in the Senate during the 16 years that my husband was Senator." [...] She added to reproduce historically accurate scenes would have been [...] "absurd." ...|$|E
500|$|La Dispute {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} Wildlife in pieces to accommodate their intense tour schedule. The album was recorded at two different studios with recording engineers Andrew Everding and Joe Pedulla. They {{started with the}} instrumentation of six tracks at Drasik Studios in Chicago; this recording process took place over two weeks. The songwriting featured on the album is distinct from La Dispute's previous releases. Dreyer wrote the stories or the concepts behind each song, and then the band adapted these stories into lyrics and created music to revolve around them. In an interview, Dreyer was asked how the songwriting differs; {{he said that the}} lyrics were written before the music was composed. He was quoted as saying: [...] "This time around, we switched the process up entirely. Previous to Wildlife, we'd always start music first and add vocals later based on the way the song felt. This time around, because we had a more concrete concept going into it, and <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to work even more as a single unit [...] " [...] Dreyer and the rest of La Dispute had expressed interest in writing a conceptual record, but with ambiguity so it would not limit the listener's experience. [...] "Oftentimes, I think records with a linear narrative narrow the ways in which a person can enjoy it, and not everyone wants to sit down and listen to something front to back." [...] When they returned from their touring in Australia in February 2011 they [...] "dropped {{off the face of the}} earth" [...] for two months, during which their writing sessions lasted twelve to fourteen hours a day.|$|E

500|$|A {{recording}} made at Carfax Tower in Oxford {{provided the}} bell chimes heard {{at the end}} of [...] "Strange Ones". These chimes were only heard on the I Should Coco version, not on Supergrass is 10, because on the I Should Coco album the chimes are used as a transition to the next track, [...] "Sitting Up Straight", which was not included in Supergrass is 10. [...] "Strange Ones" [...] was written about Cowley Road, Oxford, a place where the band once lived. It was originally intended to be the [...] "throwaway song" [...] on the B-side to [...] "Caught by the Fuzz". Another song on the album with the same theme, [...] "I'd Like To Know", was inspired by listening to [...] "Strange Ones" [...] played backwards on tape cassette. Supergrass took this sound, wrote new lyrics for it, and had another song for their album. Gaz Coombes says, [...] "One of the highlights of this album was recording 'Sofa (Of My Lethargy)'.... I remember everybody got in the live room and had an instrument, including Sam [...] on bass, a friend of his on hammond organ and we played the rest, all live, one take.... We made I Should Coco so fast <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to catch the energy and excitement of the songs on tape, and do it before the money ran out!" [...] In a 2005 interview with BBC Radio London Quinn remembered [...] "writing that song [...] in my living room on a rainy day and Gaz sort of turned up with this chord sequence and we just went straight through it and just did it on 4 track".|$|E
2500|$|According to Greenwood, {{he began}} playing bass out of necessity, {{teaching}} himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said: [...] "We {{were people who}} picked up their respective instruments <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to play music together, rather than just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to play that particular instrument. So {{it was more of}} a collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t think of myself as a bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people." [...] Among his musical influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E

We weren't interested in the French New Wave. We were interested in Clint Eastwood and James Bond and Walt Disney, because that's how we grew up." [...] Zemeckis graduated from USC in 1973.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We discuss key {{properties}} {{that we have}} focused on when designing the Model-Oriented Programming language Umple and its support tools. Usability is key <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> to enable modellers to work rapidly, make fewer mistakes, and appreciate the benefits of modeling better. Completeness in code generation with respect to UML is important because most tools omit important semantics in the code they generate. Scalability is important <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>want</b> it to be possible to develop a system of arbitrary size. In this paper we highlight some of the essentials of how we have addressed these key properties in Umple. We also discuss how these properties {{can be used to}} compare modeling approaches. ...|$|R

And at some level, I can’t blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation." [...] On November 2, he again expressed sympathy with frustrations about the economy but also said many of the complaints levied at the Fed, including those made against the steps it took during the financial crisis, are misguided. “The concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions,” he said. “A very simplistic interpretation of that [...] was that we were doing that <b>because</b> <b>we</b> <b>wanted</b> to preserve banker salaries.
