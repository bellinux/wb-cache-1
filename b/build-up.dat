40|$|Ramey (2011 a) {{and others}} argue that {{increases}} in government spending associated with wars and military <b>build-ups</b> constitute a good instrument for measuring the macroeconomic effects of fiscal shocks. We argue that this instrument has two important drawbacks: the composition of government spending during military <b>build-ups</b> in the US differs substantially from general government expenditure, and increases in military spending tend to crowd out federal non-defense spending as well as spending by state and local governments. These weaknesses help to explain why fiscal multipliers estimated with military <b>build-ups</b> tend to be smaller than those estimated using other approaches...|$|R

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{threatening}} features of the new North Vietnamese <b>build-up</b> was the air defence network that was established within South Vietnam, which by 1975 consisted of twenty-two regiments equipped with radar-controlled gun systems and formidable SA-2 Guideline and shoulder-launched SA-7 Grail anti-aircraft missiles. Such systems posed a major deterrent to the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, since its aircraft were not {{equipped to deal with}} such threats. As a result, South Vietnamese aerial interdiction of the communist logistical <b>build-up</b> became almost impossible and reconnaissance flights were held to a minimum. This lack of active intelligence collection made estimation of North Vietnamese strength and intentions much more difficult.|$|E

40|$|During {{previous}} studies of the Upper-Palaeozoic carbonate <b>build-ups</b> at the Loppa High in SW Barents Sea, a connection between locations of the <b>build-ups</b> and syn-depositional faults was observed. This thesis is studying this relationship in detail, applying the Ant-tracking semi-automated method for detection of faults. To my knowledge, this relatively new method has not {{been used in the}} Barents Sea area before. The Ant-tracking is a patent protected technology developed by Schlumberger Stavanger Research for PetrelTM software for automatic detection of faults and fractures from three dimensional seismic data. In this thesis, two 3 D seismic surveys were used, the SG 9810 survey and the high resolution NH 0372 site survey. In both of these surveys faults and fractures were revealed. These were further analyzed and also visualized in three dimensions. The connection between the positions of the Upper-Palaeozoic carbonate <b>build-ups</b> and the positions of faults and fractures was confirmed. Furthermore, all the detected <b>build-ups</b> were associated with one or two faults or fractures...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The use of {{electron}} beam technology for freeforming 321 SS was investigated using 347 SS solid wire and BNi- 2 brazing paste as filler materials. The {{electron beam}} freeforming (EBFF) studies involved examining {{the effect of}} processing parameters {{on the characteristics of}} the line <b>build-ups.</b> Specifically, the effective growth rate and the dimensional features (height-to-width ratio) of the <b>build-ups</b> were found to be dependent on the beam energy and the filler material conditions (e. g. wire feed rate and the number of re-melting passes). The EBFF work indicated that <b>build-ups</b> with either filler material could be deposited on 321 SS using an optimized processing window that resulted in properties comparable to technical data available for 347 SS and BNi- 2...|$|R

40|$|The {{literature}} on estimating macroeconomic effects of fiscal policy requires suitable instruments to identify exogenous and unanticipated spending shocks. So far, {{the instrument of}} choice has been military <b>build-ups.</b> This instrument, however, largely limits the analysis to the US as few other countries {{have been involved in}} mainly extraterritorial conflicts. Moreover, the expenditure associated with military <b>build-ups</b> affects primarily the defense sector so that the resulting multiplier does not necessarily approximate the effects of changes to general government spending. We propose an alternative instrument: government relief expenditure in the wake of natural disasters which is more similar in its scope to general government spending. We construct a rich data set of natural disasters and the corresponding government responses at the US state level. We apply this methodology both at the state as well as national levels and show that natural disasters serve as a powerful instrument for identifying government spending shocks. Furthermore, we show that the multiplier pertaining to non-defense government spending is higher than the defense-spending multiplier estimated in the literature using military <b>build-ups...</b>|$|R
