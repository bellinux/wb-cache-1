Mondrag처n planned not only to relieve Groenlo, but also to lure Maurice into a pitched battle. The Dutch general, however, on receiving news of his enemy's march, set fire to supplies, tools and ammunitions gathered for the siege and retreated two miles out of Groenlo. Mondrag처n could therefore ressuply the town unmolested.|$|E

5|$|Several {{witnesses}} reported men collecting for charity. On 20 April, {{four hundred}} yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking man asked a tourist in her holiday apartment for money for an orphanage in nearby Espiche. She described him as pushy and intimidating, and said he made her feel uncomfortable. Apparently there were no orphanages or similar institutions in or near Espiche at that time. On the afternoon of 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street. Polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On {{the day of the}} disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections <b>by</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> in the streets around 5A. At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice in or near Espiche, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.|$|E
5|$|The {{black and}} white {{sequences}} begin with Leonard Shelby, an insurance investigator, in a motel room speaking to an unseen and unknown caller. Leonard has anterograde amnesia and is unable to store recent memories, {{the result of an}} attack <b>by</b> <b>two</b> <b>men.</b> Leonard explains that he killed the attacker who raped and strangled his wife, but a second clubbed him and escaped. The police did not accept that there was a second attacker, but Leonard believes the attacker's name is John or James, with a last name starting with G. Leonard conducts his own investigation using a system of notes, Polaroids, and tattoos. From his occupation, Leonard recalls a fellow anterograde amnesiac: Sammy Jankis. Sammy's diabetic wife, who wasn't sure if his condition was genuine, repeatedly requested insulin; she hoped that he would remember having given her an injection and stop himself from giving another before she died of an overdose. However, Sammy continues to administer the injections, and his wife falls into a fatal coma.|$|E

5|$|The {{preservation}} of oral history may {{be achieved through}} musical performance in Madagascar. Among the Betsileo, for instance, oral histories are retold through a form of musical performance called the rija, which {{in its current form}} may represent a combination of the original, single-verse rija and an epic poem called the isa. The Betsileo rija is performed <b>by</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> who each play a jejy while singing very loudly with a strained pitch in the soprano range. The structure of the song is complex and, unlike other Malagasy musical styles, parallel thirds are not predominant in the harmony. Other Southern ethnic groups also perform simplified variations of the rija featuring for example a solo musician who strums rather than fiddles his accompanying instrument and sings at a lower, more natural pitch. While the Betsileo rija can address diverse themes, those performed by other southern groups are almost always praise songs recalling a favorably memorable event.|$|E
5|$|The {{search for}} bodies continued, but with winter setting {{in it was}} called off in November. Presented with the {{evidence}} of the tape recording, Brady admitted to taking the photographs of Lesley Ann Downey, but insisted that she had been brought to Wardle Brook Avenue <b>by</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> who had subsequently taken her away again, alive. Brady was further charged with the murder of John Kilbride, and Hindley with the murder of Edward Evans, on 2 December. At the committal hearing on 6 December, Brady was charged with the murders of Edward Evans, John Kilbride, and Lesley Ann Downey, and Hindley with the murders of Edward Evans and Lesley Ann Downey, as well as with harbouring Brady in the knowledge that he had killed John Kilbride. The prosecution's opening statement was held in camera, and the defence asked for a similar stipulation, but was refused. The proceedings continued in front of three magistrates in Hyde over an 11-day period during December, {{at the end of which}} the pair were committed for trial at Chester Assizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{size of the}} raiding force {{depended}} on the objective. The smallest raid was conducted <b>by</b> <b>two</b> <b>men</b> from No. 6 Commando in Operation J V. The largest was the 10,500 man Operation Jubilee. Most of the raids were scheduled to only last overnight although some, like Operation Gauntlet, were conducted {{over a number of}} days. In north west Europe there were 57 raids made between 1940 and 1944. Of these 36 were against targets in France. There were 12 raids against Norway, seven raids in the Channel Islands, and single raids were made in Belgium and the Netherlands. The success of the raids varied; Operation Chariot, the raid against dock installations at St Nazaire, has been hailed as the greatest raid of all time, but others, like Operation Aquatint and Operation Musketoon, resulted in the capture or death of all involved. The smaller raids ended in mid-1944 on the orders of Major General Robert Laycock, who suggested that they were no longer as effective and only resulted in the Germans strengthening their beach defences, something that could be extremely detrimental to Allied plans.|$|E
