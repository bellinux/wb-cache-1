Against {{the wishes of}} Sukarno, the government ended Konfrontasi with Malaysia and rejoined the United Nations (Sukarno had removed Indonesia from the UN in the previous year).

5|$|In Besançon, the Catholics had {{executed}} Protestants {{for religious}} reasons since 1528. Despite the punishment, prosecution, and <b>banning</b> <b>of</b> Protestants in Besançon, Archbishop Antoine struggled {{to contain the}} spread of Protestant ideas.

On 1 March 1562, the murder of Huguenots in Wassy, France began the French Wars of Religion. By then, Besançon had become part of an independent republic protected by the Holy Roman Empire, which mostly untouched {{in the beginning of}} the conflict. Despite the oppression in Besançon, many French Protestant reformers continued to flock to the city.|$|E

5|$|The anti-Hindi activists from Madras State {{were not}} {{satisfied}} with the 1967 Amendment, as it did not address their concerns about the three language formula.
