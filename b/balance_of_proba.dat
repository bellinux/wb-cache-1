5|$|While {{scholars}} {{have proposed a}} number of hypotheses {{to explain why the}} poem was written, a definitive answer to this question remains elusive. But regardless <b>of</b> <b>Proba's</b> intent, there is evidence that the poem was widely circulated, and it eventually was used in schools to teach the tenets of Christianity, alongside Augustine of Hippo's De Doctrina Christiana. Critical reception to the poem, however, was more mixed. A pseudonymous work purportedly by Pope Gelasius I disparaged the poem, deeming it apocryphal. Many also believe that St. Jerome disliked the poem. At the same time, others like Isidore of Seville, Petrarch, and Giovanni Boccaccio wrote highly <b>of</b> <b>Proba.</b> During the 19th and 20th centuries the poem was criticized as being of poor quality, but recent {{scholars have}} written more positively about it.|$|R

500|$|Because {{historical}} information about Proba is limited, many scholars {{have taken to}} analyzing Cento Vergilianus de laudibus Christi so as {{to learn more about}} the poet herself. According to the classicist Bernice Kaczynski, [...] "Scholars have seen traces <b>of</b> <b>Proba's</b> own character in her emphasis on the beauty of the natural world, readily apparent in her account of the creation." [...] The cento suggests that Proba had great regard for [...] "domestic matters, for marriage and the family, for marital devotion and [...] filial piety". While the New Testament stresses asceticism, Proba seems to de-emphasize its importance, given that topics like virginity and poverty are not recurring themes in the poem. In regards to issues <b>of</b> finance, <b>Proba</b> reinterprets a number of New Testament episodes in which Jesus urged his followers to eschew wealth as passages suggesting that Christians should merely share wealth with their families. These changes illustrate Proba's historical context, her socio-economic position and the expectations of her class.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{macroeconomic}} determinants <b>of</b> the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> {{payments in}} Namibia {{for the period}} 1999 to 2009. The investigation was conducted through cointegrated vector autoregression methods. The investigation reveals that fiscal balance, GDP and interest rate are the main determinants <b>of</b> <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments in Namibia. Increase in GDP and interest rate causes an improvement in the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments. The positive effect <b>of</b> GDP on <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments suggests that expansion of export has {{a positive impact on}} current account and the overall <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments. More increased export potential through the development of new products and services should be encouraged. The positive impact of interest rate on <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments suggests that interest rate {{can be used as a}} policy tool to ensure favourable capital account and for improved <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments. An improvement in the fiscal balance is also associated with an improvement in the <b>balance</b> <b>of</b> payments.
