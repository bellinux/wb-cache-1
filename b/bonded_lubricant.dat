40|$|Abstract: A {{study of}} fly {{stiction}} caused after a head slider flew over a disk surface {{was conducted to}} understand the mechanisms responsible for high stiction. In this paper, laser-textured disks and three types of nanosliders (50 per cent of the standard size) were used. Friction/stiction was measured and the r. m. s. acoustic emission was recorded in both a short sweep test where the slider swept for periods of 1 h and a long-sweep test where the slider swept for periods of 6 days. The surface of the head slider after tests was analysed using optical microscopy, atomic force microscopy/frictional force microscopy and Raman spectroscopy. Results showed that, in the short sweep test, stiction was sensitive to environmental humidity. Stiction was low at low humidities and increased with increase in the humidity. In the long-sweep test, liquid droplets accumulated during flying were observed on the head slider surface. The vortex around the head slider {{was found to be}} responsible for the accumulation of liquid droplets. The droplets then migrated to the rail surface and led to fly stiction during the following start-up. Stiction was sensitive to these liquid droplets in addition to the humidity. Both negative- and positive-pressure sliders could cause fly stiction. A lower flying height was found to be more susceptible to fly stiction. A disk with a fully <b>bonded</b> <b>lubricant</b> film lowered the stiction. Increasing the disk speed could increase the stiction of a negative-pressure slider whereas it lowered the stiction of a positive-pressure slider because of the effects of flying heights, lubricant spin-off and intensity of the vortex...|$|E

40|$|Another spinoff to {{the food}} {{processing}} industry involves a dry lubricant developed by General Magnaplate Corp. of Linden, N. J. Used in such spacecraft as Apollo, Skylab and Viking, the lubricant is a coating bonded to metal surfaces providing permanent lubrication and corrosion resistance. The coating lengthens equipment life and permits machinery to be operated at greater speed, thus increasing productivity and reducing costs. <b>Bonded</b> <b>lubricants</b> are used in scores of commercia 1 applications. They have proved particularly valuable to food processing firms because, while increasing production efficiency, they also help meet the stringent USDA sanitation codes for food-handling equipment. For example, a cookie manufacturer plagued production interruptions because sticky batter was clogging the cookie molds had the brass molds coated to solve the problem. Similarly, a pasta producer faced USDA action on a sanitation violation because dough was clinging to an automatic ravioli-forming machine; use of the anti-stick coating on the steel forming plates solved the dual problem of sanitation deficiency and production line downtime...|$|R

40|$|To {{obtain a}} better {{understanding}} of how <b>bonded</b> solid <b>lubricant</b> films lubricate and wear (in general), the tribological properties of polyimide-bonded graphite fluoride films were studied (in specific). A pin-on-disk type of testing apparatus was used; but in addition to sliding a hemispherically tipped rider, a rider with a 0. 95 mm diameter flat area was slid against the film. This was done so that a lower, less variable contact stress could be achieved. Two stages of lubrication occurred. In the first, the film supported the load. The lubricating mechanism consisted of the shear of a thin surface layer (of the film) between the rider and the bulk of the film. The second occurred after the bonded film had worn to the substrate, and consisted of the shear of very thin lubricant films between the rider and flat plateaus generated on the metallic substrate asperities. The film wear mechanism was strongly dependent on contact stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} spatial {{environmental}} {{factors such as}} the very low ambient pressure and the absencc of oxygen on lubrication are discussed. The low pressure causes liquids, and even solids, to boil away, so that their vapour pressure and evaporation rates become important. Evaporation experiments with mctals, liquids, greases and solid lubricants are discussed. Silicone oils and silicone-based greases appear to have the lowest evaporative loss among the fluids investigated. Bearing experiments indicate that liquids and greases, when properly shielded, can provide longer bearing lives than <b>bonded</b> solid <b>lubricants</b> or metal platings. Silicone fluids yield the best bearing life, confirming the results of evaporation tests. Life results with bonded solid films are generally poor. Kesults are considerably better when the solid lubricant is used as a constituent in a solid-composite material.

40|$|The {{contribution}} of sliding-induced, atomic-scale instabilities to the kinetic friction force is investigated by molecular dynamics. For this purpose, we derive {{a relationship between}} the kinetic friction force F_ k and the non-equilibrium velocity distribution P(v) of the lubricant particles. P(v) typically shows exponential tails, which cannot be described in terms of an effective temperature. It is investigated which parameters control the existence of instabilities and how they affect P(v) and hence F_ k. The effects of the interfaces' dimensionality, lubricant coverage, and internal degrees of freedom of lubricant particles on F_ k are studied explicitly. Among other results we find that the kinetic friction between commensurate surfaces is much more susceptible to changes in (i) lubricant coverage, (ii) sliding velocity, and (iii) <b>bond</b> length of <b>lubricant</b> molecules than incommensurate surfaces.

40|$|New {{environmental}} regulations {{all over the}} world encourage the use of alternatives to cadmium plating for corrosion-protection systems used on steels. Boeing patents are pending on a non-cyanide replacement zinc nickel alloy electroplating process with superior properties, including low hydrogen embrittlement and good corrosion protection, for use on highstrength steels and other substrates. Another advantage of this process is low cost because conventional electroplating tank facilities can be used and waste treatment cost can be reduced. The feasibility of this zinc-nickel plating process has been successfully demonstrated in the laboratory and is scheduled for manufacturing scale-up during 1983. ALTHOUGH THE CADMIUM AND CYANIDE HAZARDS to human health are well known and documented W*, cyanide cadmium electroplating is widely used on steel for its many beneficial properties (2, 3, 4). In the United States alone, the annual cadmium consumption for plating is approximately five million pounds (5). Increasingly stringent {{environmental regulations}} {{all over the world}} encourage the use of alternatives to cadmium plating for corrosion-protection systems used on steel. For aircraft highstrength steel parts, a substitute for cadmium plating must ensure long-term corrosion protection and provide low hydrogen embrittlement (LHE) (6, 7, 8, 9).

This paper presents the performance of both inorganic commercial lubricants and environmental friendly organic palm oil based lubricants, when turning FCD 700 cast iron using carbide tool.

Materials and methods: The crown of extracted, caries-free human molars was transversally sectioned with a model trimmer to prepare the dentin surfaces from mid-coronal sound dentin, and then uniformly abraded with # 600 silicon carbide paper. The dentin surfaces were randomly divided into three groups: oil-free spray group where maintenance cleaner for air bearing handpieces was sprayed onto the dentin surface for 1 s and rinsed with water spray for 30 s; oil-containing spray group where maintenance cleaner for micro motor handpieces was sprayed onto the dentin surface for 1 s and rinsed with water spray for 30 s; and control group where the surface was rinsed with water spray for 30 s and then air-dried. These surfaces were then bonded with Clearfil SE Bond (Kuraray Medical), and resin composite (Clearfil AP-X, Kuraray Medical) build-up crowns were incrementally constructed on the bonded surfaces. After storage for 24 h in 37 &deg;C water, the bonded teeth were sectioned into hour-glass shaped slices (0. 7 -mm thick) perpendicular to the bonded surfaces.

40|$|The {{negative}} effect of magnesium stearate on tablet strength is widely known. This strength reduction is always {{considered to be}} the result of reduction of interparticle bonding. It is also known that interparticle bonding affects relaxation of tablets. Relaxation increases with decreasing bonding. Microcrystalline cellulose is an example of a material with a high lubricant sensitivity, which effect is caused by its plastic deformation behavior during compression. This paper shows for microcrystalline cellulose that the porosity under pressure was equal for unlubricated tablets and for tablets containing 0. 5 % magnesium stearate. This points to equal densification properties. The lubricated tablets show, however, a much larger relaxation than the tablets without magnesium stearate, This difference can be ascribed to the reduction of interparticle <b>bonding</b> by the <b>lubricant,</b> because a strong interparticle bonding counteracts tablet relaxation. In contrast to microcrystalline cellulose, aggregated gamma-sorbitol (Karion Instant) has a low lubricant sensitivity. Both porosity under pressure and tablet relaxation were found to be equal for lubricated and unlubricated sorbitol tablets. This phenomenon is caused by the particle structure of gamma-sorbitol. During compression, a lubricant film will be destroyed by fragmentation of the sorbitol aggregates. For this reason, magnesium stearate will hardly affect the interparticle bonding between sorbitol particles and hence have only a small or no effect on tablet relaxation. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B.

The {{objective was to}} examine step loading wear by use of surface analysis, wetting, and chemical bonding changes in the lubricant. The investigation consisted of steploading wear studies by a pin or disk tribometer, the effects on wear related to wetting by contact angle and surface tension measurements of various liquid systems, the chemical <b>bonding</b> changes between <b>lubricant</b> and TCP chromatographic analysis, and by determining the reaction between the TCP and metal surfaces through wear scar analysis by Auger emission spectroscopy (AES). The steploading curve for the base fluid alone shows rapid increase of wear rate with load. The steploading curve for the base fluid in presence of 4. 25 percent by volume TCP under dry air purge has shown a great reduction of wear rate with all loads studied. It has also been found that the addition of 4. 25 percent by volume TCP plus 0. 33 percent by volume water to the base lubricant under N 2 purge also greatly reduces the wear rate with all loads studied. AES surface analysis reveals a phosphate type wear resistant film, which greatly increases load-bearing capacity, formed on the iron disk.

The general theories of friction for metals in sliding contact and the friction theory applied to solid film lubrication are reviewed. A section is also included on Herzian contact theory and its application to solid films. A screening test is described for 12 BSLs applied to commercial components. This programme provided information on the friction coefficient and allowed the selection of one of these finishes for a further more in depth study. In general the friction coefficients obtained were higher than those quoted by the material manufacturers, it was presumed that this was due as the consequence of differences in test methods. Three test programmes are described that were conducted on a new pin on disc facility, a major programme to study the performance under various conditions at pressures above the yield pressure of the film. The information was used in the formulation of an empirical equation {{that can be used to}} predict the friction coefficient. This programme also demonstrated: that there were three distinct phases of performance, contact life increased with high loads and increased velocity, the friction coefficient in the steady state phase was between 0. 18 and 0. 22. The second programme examined the evolution of the wear scar on the ball and wear track on the disc. The programme illustrated the development of a transfer film on the ball and the steady increase in friction coefficient to a point where it became stable and the wear scar on the ball changed to a circular flat. The third programme investigated the friction coefficient at very low loads that produced pressures below or close to the yield pressure of the film. The results from this programme demonstrate that as the load increases, the friction coefficient decreases, this can be attributed to the Hertzian contact area being proportional to the load 213 and the friction force is proportional to the area, then the friction coefficient F/W is proportional to the load W- 1 / 3. In the penultimate chapter theoretical predictions for the friction coefficient under various contact conditions are compared with the experimental results obtained, in general the calculated results are higher and some possible causes are given for the discrepancies...|$|R

Due to temperature rise of PFPE Zdol lubricant molecules on a DLC surface, how polar end groups are detached from lubricant molecules during coating is described considering the effect of temperatures on the bond/break density of PFPE Zdol using the coarse-grained bead spring model based on finitely extensible nonlinear elastic potential. As PFPE Z contains no polar end groups, effects of temperature on the bond/break density (number of broken bonds/total number of bonds) are not so significant like PFPE Zdol. Effects of temperature on the bond/break density of PFPE Z on DLC surface are also discussed {{with the help of}} graphical results.

40|$|Background: The {{complexity}} of the compaction process specially with using high-speed tablet presses necessitates the use of robust monitoring tools during the process. The use of an instrumented compaction simulator in the early stage of development has a significant benefit for product development and scaling-up. Up to now, in tableting research rare {{attention has been paid}} to the measurement of die-wall pressure. Die-wall instrumentation would be essential to understand the deformation of particles under axial pressure during the compaction cycle. It would be also of great help to investigate particle–die-wall shear stresses or friction, which is the cause of many tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking. Purpose: To investigate the effect of compaction process variables ((pre) compression pressure, speed, ejection angle, tooling shape), formulation variables (filler, lubricant, binder, drug loading), powder physico-chemical properties (particle size and shape, water activity) on the compaction process through radial die-wall monitoring. Common tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking were also investigated. Materials and Methods: Using a fully instrumented compaction simulator, the Presster™ guided by mathematical modeling and experimental design. Materials with different compaction behaviors: viscoelastic, plastic, brittle, plastic/brittle. Results and Discussion: Regarding tablet press parameters, by increasing compaction pressure radial die-wall pressure was increased for all materials (RDP and MDP), while with increasing pre-compaction residual die-wall pressure (RDP) was decreased for plastic materials, whereas by increasing speed maximum die-wall pressure (MDP) was decreased for all materials. Plastic and brittle materials showed increased tendencies for friction because of high radial relaxation. An increasing RDP value during compaction would indicate higher tendency for friction, whereas a high constant value of MDP would provide an evidence for plastic behavior. High compaction force combined with high speed should be avoided to prevent capping. Increasing ejection angle increased friction tendencies and ejection force for powders. Effective Fall Time (EFT) derived from decompression time was a reliable tool for sticking prediction. Moreover, radial die-wall monitoring was a more sensitive tool to detect sticking in comparison to take-off force. Flat shape tooling increased radial die-wall pressure while it was reduced by concave tooling due to more homogeneity in density distribution as well as greater area of contact. However, concave tooling showed higher friction and capping in comparison to flat tooling due to more radial movement for the powder, which resulted in higher densification at the edges in comparison to flat tooling. Concerning formulation variables, additives enhancing the elasticity or weakening the <b>bonds</b> such as <b>lubricants</b> or increasing drug loading promoted the occurrence of capping, while additives improving the mechanical strength such as binders reduced capping. The RDP/MDP ratio was not suitable as a sensitive parameter for the evaluation of lubricants, since it was only changed for plastic and/or brittle materials. Also, MDP was a good predictor for axial pressure transmission to the die-wall. External lubrication reduced the die-wall-compact friction without affecting the deformation behavior of the formulation. High RDP values were not always responsible for capping, because MCC exhibited low RDP values and still showed capping, therefore, other parameters such ER 0 and tensile strength should also be considered. Regarding physico-chemical properties of powders, small / irregular particles acted more plastically at high compression, showed better axial pressure transmission, more porous and stronger compacts, and had higher tendency for friction and sticking than bigger particles. On the other hand, high water activity resulted in a low RDP and friction for all materials, and a high MDP for plastic materials. This was due to the lubricating and plasticizing effects of water, respectively. Conclusion: Radial die-wall pressure monitoring is recommended as a valuable tool to assess the deformation behavior of materials and detect friction and adhesion at early stages of development and during production as well, which would be of great help to predict common scaling-up tableting problems such as capping, lamination, and sticking...|$|R
