50|$|The hybrid {{electrothermal}} light-gas gun {{works on}} similar {{principles of the}} standard light-gas gun, but adds an electric arc to heat the light gas to a higher temperature and pressure than the piston alone. The arc is applied in the chamber containing the light gas, raising the temperature and pressure {{to the point where}} the gas both breaks the <b>bursting</b> <b>disk</b> and ignites the propellant behind the piston, which is perforated to allow ignition. The resulting combination of electrical heating and piston compression provide higher pressures and temperatures, resulting in more power and a higher potential speed than a standard light-gas gun.|$|E
50|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>Disk</b> Valve: Used {{in a few}} {{pneumatics}} but {{primarily in}} hybrid cannons, burst valves are considered the ideal pressure release mechanism as they allow an unobstructed flow of high pressure air. <b>Burst</b> <b>disks</b> have no moving parts, making them very reliable. They are very appealing for hybrid cannons because they can withstand the low pressure gas mix in the chamber before ignition, yet fail as planned upon successful ignition. The high pressure combustion gases are released into the barrel at a rate which generates greater velocities than a mechanical valve could allow. Pneumatic cannon burst discs work similarly. The disc and projectile are loaded, and the chamber is pressurised until the disc ruptures. Unfortunately, this usually does not give the operators {{much in the way}} of control over timing, although a puncturing mechanism can be used. <b>Burst</b> <b>disks</b> are of no specific material and may consist of plastic or thin sheet metal or foil.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{second phase}} of the CO 2 PIPETRANS Joint Industry Project (JIP) aims to fill {{knowledge}} gaps associated with the safe and reliable pipeline transport of CO 2. The JIP has three main focus areas and technical work packages designed to address these. The work packages collect experimental data and experience on dense phase CO 2 release model validation data, pipeline fracture arrest, and corrosion. This paper presents an overview of results and conclusions from the work package focusing on collection of data for validation of release models. The JIP consists of 15 partner organisations, who are: Arcelor Mittal, BP, DNV GL, Endesa, ENI, E. on Ruhrgas, Gassco, Gassnova, Health and Safety Executive (HSE) UK, Maersk Oil, Petrobras, Petroleum Safety Authority (PSA) Norway, Shell, V&M Tubes, and Vattenfall. The objective of the CO 2 release model validation data work package was to collect and make available data for validating release and dispersion models for dense phase CO 2. This involved releasing dense phase CO 2 from large inventories through orifices ranging in size 6 mm to 150 mm onto a suitably sized array of instruments to measure the CO 2 concentration and temperature profiles. The condition of the CO 2 being released was up to 150 barg and 150 °C with release durations up to 10 minutes. Most of the releases were in a horizontal orientation 1 m above the ground but during some of the tests the orientation was changed to be upwards, downwards to impact the ground, or into an enclosure. In addition to the CO 2 releases described above, the work package also undertook rapid depressurisation of a long horizontal pipe containing 100 barg CO 2 in order to collect data, amongst other aspects, on shock wave propagation. These experiments used a 200 m long, 50 mm diameter pipe mounted on load cells with an orifice plate and explosive initiated <b>bursting</b> <b>disk</b> at one end. In addition to measuring data within the pipe during the rapid depressurisation tests, dispersion and temperature data was also recorded downstream of the release for release model validation purposes. The paper presents an overview of the frontier experimental work mentioned above along with discussion on the output of the data review that was subsequently completed during which recorded data was compared with model predictions. Validation of dispersion models and safety studies reduces the uncertainty and hence conservatism required in these studies thereby making design and implementation of CO 2 pipelines safer and more cost effective...|$|E
40|$|<b>Burst</b> <b>disks,</b> {{commonly}} used in pressure relief applications, were studied as single-use valves. A dual-burst disk design was chosen for primary investigation for systems involving separation of gases of two significantly different pressures. The two disks are used to seal either end of a piston cavity that has a different cross-sectional area on each side. Different piston surface areas are used to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium, P{sub 1 }A{sub 1 } = P{sub 2 }A{sub 2 }. The single-use valve functions when the downstream pressure is reduced to approximately atmospheric pressure, creating a pressure differential that causes the <b>burst</b> <b>disks</b> to fail. Several parameters were studied to determine the optimum design of the <b>burst</b> <b>disk.</b> These parameters include thickness, diameter, area/pressure ratio, scoring, and disk geometry. The disk material was limited to 304 L stainless steel. Factors that were considered essential to the optimization of the design were robustness, manufacturability, and burst pressure variability. The thicknesses of the disks that were studied range from 0. 003 in. to 0. 010 in. A model for predicting burst pressures of the <b>burst</b> <b>disks</b> was derived. The model combines membrane stress theory with force/displacement data to predict the burst pressure of various designs to within {+-} 10 %. This model results from studies that characterize the behavior of individual small and large disks. Welding techniques used to join the dual-disk assembly are discussed. Laser welds are used to join and seal the disks to the bulkhead. These welds were optimized for repeatability and robustness. Resistance upset welding is suggested for joining the dual-disk assembly to the pressure vessel body. Resistance upset weld parameters were developed for this particular design so as to minimize the side effects on the burst-disk performance and to provide high-quality welds...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{a comparison between}} finite element analysis results and test data from the Pressure Vessel Research Council (PVRC) <b>burst</b> <b>disk</b> program. Testing sponsored by the PVRC over 20 years ago was done by pressurizing circular flat disks made from three different materials until failure by bursting. The purpose of this re-analysis is to investigate the use of finite element analysis (FEA) to assess the primary stress limits of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (1998) and to qualify the use of elastic-plastic (EP-FEA) for limit load calculations. The three materials tested represent the range of strength and ductility found in modern pressure vessel construction and include a low strength high ductility material, a medium strength medium ductility material, and a high strength low ductility low alloy material. Results of elastic and EP-FEA are compared to test data. Stresses from the elastic analyses are linearized for comparison of Code primary stress limits to test results. Elastic-plastic analyses are done using both best-estimate and elastic-perfectly plastic (EPP) stress-strain curves. Both large strain-large displacement (LSLD) and small strain-small displacement (SSSD) assumptions are used with the EP-FEA. Analysis results are compared to test results to evaluate the various analysis methods, models, and assumptions as applied to the <b>bursting</b> of thin <b>disks...</b>|$|R
40|$|If {{the vacuum}} vessel that insulates a {{cryogenic}} dewar for a spaceborne experiment prior to launch is damaged, air will leak into the vacuum insulation space. As the sudden heat load causes {{the pressure to}} rise in the dewar, a safety disk in the emergency vent line will burst at the design pressure differential to allow vaporized cryogenic fluid to escape. The emergency vent line should be sized such that sufficient gaseous cryogen will be vented to keep the pressure inside the dewar below the design limit. On the other hand, the line should not be so large as to impose an unnecessary heat load on the dewar filled with cryogenic fluid.

Whilst this method is more controllable and in many means safer than utilising a soda bottle as a <b>burst</b> <b>disk</b> (provided pressure rated valves and piping are used), it is limited in that quick release valves, such as ball valves, are generally not bigger in diameter than 1 or 2 inches.

However, this is offset by the fact that such a design can operate at more than double the pressure of a typical dry ice bomb launcher, as soda bottles will rupture at only [...]|$|R
5000|$|Cryostats used in MRI {{machines}} {{are designed to}} hold a cryogen, typically helium, in a liquid state with minimal evaporation (boil-off). The liquid helium bath is designed to keep the superconducting magnet's bobbin of superconductive wire in its superconductive state. In this state the wire has no electrical resistance and very large currents are maintained with a low power input. To maintain superconductivity, the bobbin must be kept below its transition temperature by being immersed in the liquid helium. If, for any reason, the wire becomes resistive, i.e. loses superconductivity, a condition known as a [...] "quench", the liquid helium evaporates, instantly raising pressure within the vessel. A <b>burst</b> <b>disk,</b> usually made of carbon, is placed within the chimney or vent pipe so that during a pressure excursion, the gaseous helium can be safely vented out of the MRI suite. Modern MRI cryostats use a mechanical refrigerator (cryocooler) to re-condense the helium gas {{and return it to}} the bath, to maintain cryogenic conditions and to conserve helium.|$|R

5|$|More recently, {{manifolds}} {{have become}} available which connect the cylinders on the cylinder {{side of the}} valve, leaving the outlet connection of the cylinder valve available for connection of a regulator. This means that the connection cannot be made or broken while the cylinders are pressurised, {{as there is no}} valve to isolate the manifold from the interior of the cylinder. This apparent inconvenience allows a regulator to be connected to each cylinder, and isolated from the internal pressure independently, which allows a malfunctioning regulator on one cylinder to be isolated while still allowing the regulator on the other cylinder access to all the gas in both cylinders. These manifolds may be plain or may include an isolation valve in the manifold, which allows the contents of the cylinders to be isolated from each other. This allows the contents of one cylinder to be isolated and secured for the diver if a leak at the cylinder neck thread, manifold connection, or <b>burst</b> <b>disk</b> on the other cylinder causes its contents to be lost. A relatively uncommon manifold system is a connection which screws directly into the neck threads of both cylinders, and has a single valve to release gas to a connector for a regulator.
