25|$|In Saturday morning's free {{practice}} session Andrea Montermini, who had replaced Ratzenberger in the Simtek, {{had a huge}} crash exiting the high-speed final corner. In light of recent events, the paddock <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> sigh of relief {{when it was announced}} Montermini had escaped with only a broken ankle and chipped heel. Schumacher took pole ahead of Hill, Häkkinen, Lehto, Barrichello and Alesi. As Simtek and Sauber both fielded only 1 car for the race, both Pacific cars were able to qualify for the race by default as they did in Monaco.|$|E
500|$|Critics judged Leyland {{a better}} Test than county batsman. His {{first-class}} batting figures were not exceptional {{compared to other}} cricketers who played far fewer Test matches, but in Tests, his average is six runs an innings higher; against Australia, the strongest of England's opponents during his career, he averaged 56, a further increase of ten runs. Gibson suggests that he rose to the big occasions, and that he performed best against the toughest opponents. According to Leyland's obituary in The Times, [...] "He was essentially a man for the big occasion, a batsman at his best in a crisis, and his favourite game was a Roses match or an Australian Test. England's supporters often <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> sigh of relief to see his burly figure purposefully striding to the wicket." [...] The writer R. C. Robertson-Glasgow suggested that Leyland in a Test match was like the [...] "four-squarers of ancient or romantic times. He was Horatius on the tottering bridge; Hector, who alone stood between Troy and destruction. He was born to rescue. But he is more dangerous {{than those who are}} stubborn or grim. He has something of D'Artagnan in him; there is a gaiety besides the simplicity and strength; seen in the slight list of the cap, and in a certain jauntiness and optimism of gait." ...|$|E
500|$|It was Plath's {{publication}} of Ariel in 1965 that precipitated her rise to fame. As {{soon as it}} was published, critics began to see the collection as the charting of Plath's increasing desperation or death wish. Her dramatic death became her most famous aspect, and remains so. Time and Life both reviewed the slim volume of Ariel in the wake of her death. The critic at Time said: [...] "Within a week of her death, intellectual London was hunched over copies of a strange and terrible poem she had written during her last sick slide toward suicide. 'Daddy' was its title; its subject was her morbid love-hatred of her father; its style was as brutal as a truncheon. What is more, 'Daddy' was merely the first jet of flame from a literary dragon who in the last months of her life <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> burning river of bile across the literary landscape. [...] In her most ferocious poems, 'Daddy' and 'Lady Lazarus,' fear, hate, love, death and the poet's own identity become fused at black heat with the figure of her father, and through him, with the guilt of the German exterminators and the suffering of their Jewish victims. They are poems, as Robert Lowell says in his preface to Ariel, that 'play Russian roulette with six cartridges in the cylinder.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Throughout the afternoon, crowds {{had filled}} the floor outside the blocked-off aisle, and the {{galleries}} as well, {{wanting to see}} the President, {{even if they could}} not greet him. [...] McKinley arrived just on time, glanced at the arrangements, and walked over to his place, where he stood with Milburn on his left and Cortelyou on his right. [...] The pipe organ began to play [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] as McKinley ordered the doors open to admit those who had waited to greet him. The police let them in, and McKinley prepared to perform his [...] "favorite part of the job." [...] An experienced politician, McKinley could shake hands with 50 people per minute, gripping their hands first so as to both guide them past him quickly and prevent his fingers from being squeezed. [...] Cortelyou anxiously watched the time; about halfway through the ten minutes allotted, he sent word to Babcock to have the doors closed when the presidential secretary raised his hand. Seeing Cortelyou looking at his watch, Babcock moved towards the doors. [...] As the reception continued, the organist played works by Johann Sebastian Bach. The procession of citizens shaking hands with their President was interrupted when 12-year-old Myrtle Ledger of Spring Brook, New York, who was accompanied by her mother, asked McKinley for the red carnation he always wore on his lapel. [...] The President gave it to her, then resumed work without his trademark good-luck piece. [...] The Secret Service men looked suspiciously on a tall, swarthy man who appeared restless as he walked towards the President, but <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> sigh of relief when he shook hands with McKinley without incident and began to move towards the exit. [...] The usual rule that those who approached the President must do so with their hands open and empty was not being enforced, perhaps due to the heat of the day, as several people were using handkerchiefs to wipe their brows; the man who followed the swarthy individual had his right hand wrapped in one, as if injured. [...] Seeing this, McKinley reached for his left hand instead. [...] As the two men's hands touched at 4:07pm, Czolgosz shot McKinley twice in the abdomen with a [...]32 Iver Johnson revolver concealed under the handkerchief.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{incredible}} really. In 1977, I flew over to England {{with the players}} {{and that was the}} flight on which Rodney Marsh broke the world beer drinking record. Three-quarters of the players on that flight had signed these sensational Packer contracts and they were all as drunk as you could imagine. But the secret still didn't get out.

2500|$|In 1918, Sfatul Țării {{voted for}} the union of Bessarabia with the Kingdom of Romania. At the time, the Romanian army was already present in Bessarabia. US {{historian}} Charles Upson Clark notes that several Bessarabian ministers, Codreanu, Pelivan and Secara, and the Russian commander-in-chief Shcherbachev had asked for its intervention to maintain order. He also mentions that after the arrival of Romanian army [...] "all classes in Bessarabia, except the Russian revolutionaries, <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> sigh of relief". However, he adds that, at the beginning, the intervention had [...] "roused great resentment among those who still clung to {{the hope of a}} Bessarabian state within the Russian Federated Republic" [...] such as Ion Inculeț, president of Sfatul Țării and prime-minister Pantelimon Erhan who initially demanded the prompt withdrawal of the Romanian troops to avoid a civil war. However, Inculeț later welcomed Romanian general Ernest Broșteanu, who was in charge with the intervention, to a formal reception at Sfatul Țării.|$|E
2500|$|The Mikado is {{a comedy}} {{that deals with}} themes of death and cruelty. This works only because Gilbert treats these themes as trivial, even lighthearted issues. For instance, in Pish-Tush's song [...] "Our great Mikado, virtuous man", he sings: [...] "The youth who winked a roving eye / Or <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> non-connubial sigh / Was thereupon {{condemned}} to die– / He usually objected." [...] The term for this rhetorical technique is meiosis, a drastic understatement of the situation. [...] Other examples of this are when self-decapitation is described as [...] "an extremely difficult, not to say dangerous, thing to attempt", and also as merely [...] "awkward". When a discussion occurs of Nanki-Poo's life being [...] "cut short in a month", the tone remains comic and only mock-melancholy. Burial alive is described as [...] "a stuffy death". Finally, execution by boiling oil or by melted lead is described by the Mikado as a [...] "humorous but lingering" [...] punishment.|$|E

2500|$|The {{success of}} The Foundations made Chamberlain famous {{all over the}} world. In 1906, the Brazilian {{intellectual}} Sílvio Romero cited Chamberlain together with Otto Ammon, Georges Vacher de Lapouge and Arthur de Gobineau as having proved that the blond [...] "dolichocephalic" [...] people of northern Europe were the best and greatest race in the entire world, and urged that Brazil could become a great nation by a huge influx of German immigrants who would achieve the embranquecimento (whitening) of Brazil. Chamberlain received invitations to lecture on his racial theories at Yale and Johns Hopkins universities, but turned them down {{on the grounds that}} he had no wish to visit what he viewed as a culturally and spiritually debased nation like the United States. When the book was first published, reviewers often asked who this Chamberlain was, and there was much fevered speculation in the German press if Chamberlain was related to Joseph Chamberlain, the British Colonial Secretary and as the principal author of the British forward policy in South Africa one of the most detested men in the Reich. Several German magazines printed pictures of Joseph Chamberlain's sons Austen Chamberlain or Neville Chamberlain as the author of The Foundations by mistake. As such, many Germans <b>breathed</b> <b>a</b> collective sigh of relief when it was established that Houston Stewart Chamberlain was not related to the famous Chamberlain family of Birmingham. After the success of The Foundations, a Chamberlain Kreis (circle) appeared in Vienna that comprised the Indologist Leopold von Schroeder, Count Ulrich von Bülow; Countess Melanie Metternich-Zichy, Countess Marietta von Coundenhove, Baroness [...] Emma von Ehrenfels, the music critic and Wagnerite Gustav Schonaich, Count Ulrich von Brockdorff-Rantzau, Count Hermann Keyserling and Rudolf Kassner who met weekly at Chamberlain's home to discuss his racial theories. It was during this period that Chamberlain had an affair with Baroness von Ehrenfels, the wife of his friend Baron Christian von Ehrenfels and another affair with a Viennese showgirl Lili Petri. In 1906, his marriage to Anna ended in divorce. Besides the income from sales of The Foundations and the essays he was constantly writing for newspapers and journals, Chamberlain was supported financially by a wealthy German piano-manufacturer August Ludowici (who liked Chamberlain so much that he purchased a house for him) and by the Swiss industrialist Agénor Boisssier, giving an annual income of about 30,000–40,000 marks (by contrast a German school-teacher had an annual income of 1,000 marks while a professor made about 12,000 marks per year). In 1908, Chamberlain married Wagner's daughter Eva von Bülow after Cosima Wagner suggested the match, making him extremely happy to be married to the daughter of his hero Wagner.|$|E
