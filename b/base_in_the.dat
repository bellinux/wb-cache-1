Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E

5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay transmission system, the cross-rope suspension tower was invented.

The design is also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|E
