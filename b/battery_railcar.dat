50|$|From the 1950s steam-hauled {{passenger}} services {{were replaced by}} railbuses of classes VT 95 and VT 98. In recent years, passenger train services were operated with <b>battery</b> <b>railcars</b> of class 515.|$|R
50|$|The Edison-Beach <b>battery</b> <b>railcar</b> was {{developed}} by Thomas Edison and Ralph H. Beach. The latter headed the Railway Storage Battery Car Company and the Electric Car & Locomotive Corp. Car No. 105 of the Alaska Railroad was an Edison-Beach car. A notable feature of the Edison-Beach cars was the Beach drive system. Each wheel was mounted on ball bearings on a dead axle and was driven by an individual traction motor through gearing.|$|E
5000|$|Developed {{from the}} {{experimental}} [...] "Smart Denchi-kun" [...] <b>battery</b> <b>railcar</b> tested on the Karasuyama Line in 2012, the two-car EV-E301 series train operates as an electric multiple unit (EMU) under the 1,500 V DC overhead wire of the Tohoku Main Line between [...] and , and on battery {{power over the}} 20.4 km non-electrified Karasuyama Line. It can also be recharged via its pantographs at a recharging facility specially built at Karasuyama Station.|$|E
50|$|The {{line was}} {{originally}} {{built as a}} construction railway to support the building of hydroelectric dams in the Oberhasli and the Grimsel Pass. It was built by the Kraftwerke Oberhasli (KWO) company, which was founded to build and operate the hydroelectric plants, and it was opened in 1926. Several Mallet-type steam locomotives were acquired from the Rhätische Bahn to operate the line. As well as construction traffic, the line also operated a limited passenger service for workers and their families. In 1931 a <b>battery</b> <b>railcar</b> was purchased, and a second in 1939.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, a {{charging}} station for Class ETA 150 <b>battery</b> <b>railcars</b> {{was built in}} Lauterecken-Grumach. The latter operated on the lines to Lauterecken but only {{until the end of}} the decade.|$|R

50|$|When {{the license}} {{came up for}} renewal in 1976, {{it was decided to}} upgrade the line drastically. The heavy, four-wheel <b>battery</b> <b>railcars</b> were harsh on the track and trackbed, and were {{at the end of their}} {{economic}} life. The line was electrified and electric streetcar-type railcars were purchased. In 1996, a new railcar was purchased to run most services. In 2005, a second-hand railcar was purchased to act as reserve, allowing the former streetcars to be scrapped.|$|R
50|$|Battery {{electric}} {{multiple units}} were {{used on the}} line from 1914; their use ended in 1944. Photographs show the use of DR class VT 75 that had replaced the <b>battery</b> <b>railcars</b> after the Second World War. Their use probably ended in 1954, with the introduction of railbuses. DB class VT 95 railbuses operated on the Haller Willem until 1966, but due to their poor performance on the gradient and the insufficient number of seats, they were replaced by DB Class VT 98 sets, while from 1963 both classes were used. From 1962 until 1980, DB class ETA 150 <b>battery</b> <b>railcars</b> operated on the line. From 1964, DB class VT 24 railcars also operated on the line, with individual railcars being used as a substitute for other classes of railcars until 2003 on the Haller Willem. After 1975, DB Class 614 sets were used here, but their use ended around 2000. After 1993, almost all trains were run with class 628 sets, which were used until 2003. From 2000, Bombardier Talent sets were mainly used and from 2003 only Talent sets were used for passenger services.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to <b>battery</b> electric <b>railcars</b> {{there are also}} battery electric locomotives that are used on underground trains, for mining and industrial duties. Examples include the London Underground battery-electric locomotives.|$|R
50|$|A battery {{electric}} multiple unit, <b>battery</b> electric <b>railcar</b> or {{accumulator railcar}} is an electrically driven multiple unit or railcar whose energy {{is derived from}} rechargeable batteries that drive its traction motors.|$|R
50|$|A few <b>battery</b> {{electric}} <b>railcars</b> and locomotives {{were used}} in the twentieth century, but generally the use of battery power was not practical except in underground mining systems. See Accumulator car and Battery locomotive.|$|R
50|$|<b>Battery</b> {{electric}} <b>railcars</b> used by British Rail {{included the}} British Rail BEMU and British Rail Class 419. The Class 419, operational from 1959 to 2004 could run either on batteries or a third rail {{being used for}} short unelectrified section on quaysides.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century the line had up to four parallel tracks used exclusively for freight. With the decline of rail freight traffic after World War II on the line much of this track was subsequently abandoned. Some of it was brought back into operation as part of the S-Bahn or with the construction of the new long-distance tracks between Witten and Dortmund.In recent years only series 515 <b>battery</b> <b>railcars</b> ran on the section between Duisburg-Meiderich Sud and Mülheim (Ruhr)-Styrum, but these services stopped on 1 April 1995 and the line was closed on 1 May 1996. The southern platform of Duisburg-Meiderich Sud station, the embankment to the east and the bridge over the Rhine-Herne Canal were immediately removed.|$|R
50|$|After the Second World War {{passenger}} services ran {{only on the}} section from Mülheim-Speldorf to Düsseldorf-Rath (continuing to Düsseldorf Hauptbahnhof) and from Hilden to Opladen. Passenger services were discontinued between Duisburg-Wedau and Mülheim-Speldorf on 6 December 1971. This was followed on 23 September 1983 {{by the end of}} operations between Duisburg-Entenfang and Düsseldorf-Rath. Since then the only operation on the line is the Regionalbahn service, Der Wedauer (RB 37), from Duisburg Hauptbahnhof to Duisburg-Entenfang. Between Duisburg-Wedau and Lintorf, the line is also used by museum trains to access the Anger Valley Railway. Passenger services on the Opladen-Hilden section were abandoned on 23 September 1983. Passenger operations on the two sections were mainly operated in the postwar period with <b>battery</b> <b>railcars</b> of class 515, but local trains were also hauled by locomotives of classes 140 and 212 or composed of class 430 electric multiple units. A reactivation of {{passenger services}} has been discussed from time to time.|$|R
5000|$|In Japan, JR East {{tested a}} [...] "NE Train Smart Denchi-kun" [...] <b>battery</b> {{electric}} <b>railcar</b> from 2009. This vehicle {{is capable of}} running under 1,500 V DC overhead wires or on battery power alone a distance of up to 50 km away from an overhead power supply. The batteries are charged via the pantograph either when running under an overhead electric supply or at a specially built recharging facility.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the end of}} the 1950s to {{the late}} 1980s, <b>battery</b> {{electric}} <b>railcars</b> of class 515 ran on the line. From 1960 to the early 1980s, Uerdingen railbuses also operated some passenger services. From the late 1980s passenger services were operated with class 628/928 diesel multiple units. From 2000 to 2008 these were operated by trans regio with Regioshuttles. Since December 2008, the section is mainly operated by DB Regio with modern diesel multiple units of class 643.|$|R
5000|$|From {{the start}} of the revised {{timetable}} on 15 March 2014, a new EV-E301 series two-car battery electric multiple unit (BEMU) was introduced on the Karasuyama Line and Tohoku Main Line between Utsunomiya and Karasuyama. Developed from the experimental [...] "Smart Denchi-kun" [...] <b>battery</b> electric <b>railcar</b> also tested on this line since 2012, the EV-E301 series train is recharged at a special recharging facility built at Karasuyama Station, and operates on battery power over the non-electrified Karasuyama Line tracks.|$|R
50|$|Capable of {{carrying}} about 70 passengers, with 60 seated, {{and a separate}} smoking compartment, the railcar had a range of about 100 mi on one battery (charge). Apparently, a layover of about 4 hours was needed to recharge the battery. When introduced the railcar was billed as capable of being used on the Christchurch-Little River and Christchurch-Rangiora runs {{as well as being}} available for charters to other North Canterbury destinations. Being electrically powered and running on a storage <b>battery,</b> the <b>railcar</b> was very quiet, with the only wheel noise being noticeable when in motion.|$|R
5000|$|Operations were {{initially}} {{carried out with}} locomotive-hauled trains, but from the early 1960s, {{as a result of}} increasing motorisation, services were operated by the so-called [...] "saviour of branch lines", Uerdingen railbuses (class VT 95), which were eventually replaced by <b>battery</b> powered <b>railcars</b> of class 515. The track facilities in Grefrath and Lobberich were dismantled as far as possible. The station building in Lobberich was demolished 1976, Grefrath station now houses a youth club and Mulhouse station is currently used as a restaurant. After the abandonment of passenger services on the entire route on 22 May 1982 and the abandonment of freight between Kempen and Grefrath on 28 May 1983, there was still thriving freight traffic on the remaining Grefrath-Kaldenkirchen section (including Lobberich), but it was strongly restricted in the early 1990s and it was completely stopped on 31 December 1999.|$|R
40|$|The {{running test}} of railcar was {{examined}} using large lithium ion battery {{in the local}} line in Japan. 90 kWh of Mn type lithium ion battery was used. The relation between running time and voltage, current and integrating watt was investigated in detail. The railcar was run when the lithium ion battery module was discharged between 660 V and 480 V. The use of lithium ion battery had little voltage changes and enabled the smooth running compared with contact-wire type railcar. On one charge, it was also found from the running test that the railcar could run for about 40 km and the mileage improved 9 %. The running performance of lithium ion <b>battery</b> type <b>railcar</b> was equivalent to the contact-wire type railcar. It {{was found that the}} railcar powered by lithium ion battery was effec-tive for the replace of diesel type railcar in the local line...|$|R
50|$|Experiments with battery-electric railcars were {{conducted}} from around 1890 in Belgium, France, Germany and Italy. In the USA, railcars of the Edison-Beach type, with nickel-iron batteries were used from 1911. In New Zealand, a battery-electric Edison railcar operated from 1926 to 1934. The Drumm nickel-zinc battery was used on four 2-car sets between 1932 and 1946 on the Harcourt Street Line in Ireland and British Railways used lead-acid <b>batteries</b> in a <b>railcar</b> in 1958. Between 1955 and 1995 DB railways successfully operated 232 DB Class ETA 150 <b>railcars</b> utilising lead-acid <b>batteries.</b>|$|R
