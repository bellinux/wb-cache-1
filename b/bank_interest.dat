25|$|In the 1990s, <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> {{rates in}} Japan were near zero for an {{extended}} period of time. To search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits, investors used money market funds for short-term deposits instead. However, several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in 2001 due to the bankruptcy of Enron, in which several Japanese funds had invested, and investors fled into government-insured bank accounts. Since then the total value of money markets have remained low.|$|E

2500|$|Various [...] "plans" [...] {{to resolve}} the crisis were suggested; Sir Otto Niemeyer, a {{representative}} of the English banks who visited in mid-1930, proposed a deflationary plan, involving cuts to government spending and wages. Treasurer Ted Theodore proposed a mildly inflationary plan, while the Labor Premier of New South Wales, Jack Lang, proposed a radical plan which repudiated overseas debt. The [...] "Premier's Plan" [...] finally accepted by federal and state governments in June 1931, followed the deflationary model advocated by Niemeyer and included a reduction of 20 per cent in government spending, a reduction in <b>bank</b> <b>interest</b> rates and an increase in taxation. In March 1931, Lang announced that interest due in London would not be paid and the Federal government stepped in to meet the debt. In May, the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales was forced to close. The Melbourne Premiers' Conference agreed to cut wages and pensions as part of a severe deflationary policy but Lang renounced the plan. The grand opening of the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1932 provided little respite to the growing crisis straining the young federation. With multimillion-pound debts mounting, public demonstrations and move and counter-move by Lang and then Scullin, then Lyons federal governments, the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Game, had been examining Lang's instruction not to pay money into the Federal Treasury. Game judged it was illegal. Lang refused to withdraw his order and, on 13 May, he was dismissed by Governor Game. At June elections, Lang Labor's seats collapsed.|$|E

I also find a notorious reduction in the level and the speed of the pass-through since the adoption of quantitative monetary target, and a positive correlation between financial margins and aggregate macroeconomic risk perception. The apparent reduction in the interest rate pass-through since 2004 represent a challenge for conducting monetary policy under a flexible inflation targeting regime.
