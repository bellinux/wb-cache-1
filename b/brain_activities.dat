The Smoking Man meets with Jeffrey in the FBI parking lot, but disappears when Mulder spots them talking.

Diana and Skinner think this may result in adverse attention from the attorney general, and that the X-Files could be closed down if things go wrong, but Mulder dismisses that risk.|$|E

40|$|Advancing age affects both {{cognitive}} performance and functional <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> {{and interpretation of}} these effects {{has led to a}} variety of conceptual research models without always explicitly linking the two effects. However, to best understand the multifaceted effects of advancing age, age differences in functional <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> need to be explicitly tied to the cognitive task performance. This work hypothesized that age-related differences in task performance are partially explained by age-related differences in functional <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> and formally tested these causal relationships. Functional MRI data was from groups of young and old adults engaged in an executive task-switching experiment. Analyses were voxel-wise testing of moderated-mediation and simple mediation statistical path models to determine whether age group, <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> and their interaction explained task performance in regions demonstrating an effect of age group. Results identified brain regions whose age-related differences in functional <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> significantly explained age-related differences in task performance. In all identified locations, significant moderated-mediation relationships resulted from increasing <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> predicting worse (slower) task performance in older but not younger adults. Findings suggest that advancing age links task performance to the level of <b>brain</b> <b>activity.</b> The overall message of this work is that {{in order to understand the}} role of functional <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> on {{cognitive performance}}, analysis methods should respect theoretical relationships. Namely, that age affects <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> is related to task performance...|$|R

Passive brain-computer {{interfaces}} {{are designed}} to use <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> as an additional input, allowing the adaptation of the interface in real time according to the user’s mental state. The goal {{of the present study}} is to distinguish between different levels of game difficulty using non-invasive <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> measurement with functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The study is designed to lead to adaptive interfaces that respond to the user’s <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> in real time. Nine subjects played two levels of the game Pacman while their <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> was measured using fNIRS. Statistical analysis and machine learning classification results show that we can discriminate well between subjects playing or resting, and distinguish between the two levels of difficulty with some success. In contrast to most previous fNIRS studies which only distinguish <b>brain</b> <b>activity</b> from rest, we attempt to tell apart two levels of <b>brain</b> <b>activity,</b> and our results show potential for using fNIRS in an adaptive game or user interface.
