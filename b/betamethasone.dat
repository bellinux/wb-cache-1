25|$|Reassurance {{that the}} {{condition}} is benign, elimination of precipitating factors and improving oral hygiene are considered initial management for symptomatic OLP, and these measures are reported to be useful. Treatment usually involves topical corticosteroids (such as <b>betamethasone,</b> clobetasol, dexamethasone, and triamcinolone) and analgesics, or if these are ineffective and {{the condition is}} severe, the systemic corticosteroids may be used. Calcineurin inhibitors (such as pimecrolimus, tacrolimus or cyclosporin) are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Clotrimazole may be {{compounded}} with a glucocorticoid, such as <b>betamethasone,</b> in a topical cream {{for the treatment}} of tinea corporis (ringworm), tinea cruris (jock itch) and tinea pedis (athlete's foot). Although FDA approved, clotrimazole-betamethasone combination cream is not the preferred treatment for dermatophyte infections due to increased side effects from the topical glucocorticoid. Although temporary relief and partial suppression of symptoms may be observed with the combination therapy, glucocorticoids can elicite an immunosuppressive response and rebound effect that results in more severe infection typically requiring systemic antifungal agents to treat the disease. Combination creams are best avoided in order to improve treatment outcome, reduce the possibility of skin atrophy associated with prolonged topical glucocorticoid use, and to limit the cost of treatment. It can be effective in treating chronic paronychia. The preferred treatment of tinea infections is therefore with clotrimazole monotherapy.|$|E

50|$|Fucibet {{cream and}} Fucibet lipid cream both contain two active ingredients, fusidic acid and <b>betamethasone</b> valerate.Fusidic acid is an {{antibiotic}} medicine. It works by entering bacterial cells and {{interfering with the}} production of proteins that the bacteria need to divide and multiply. It does not directly kill the bacteria, but leaves them unable to increase in numbers. The existing bacteria eventually die or are destroyed by the immune system. Fusidic acid is included in this preparation to treat the bacterial infection that can sometimes occur in eczema.Betamethasone {{is a type of}} medicine called a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are medicines used for reducing inflammation. Skin inflammation in eczema occurs due to the irritation of the skin, and is caused by the release of various substances involved in the immune system. These substances cause blood vessels to widen, resulting in the affected area becoming red, swollen, itchy and painful.When <b>betamethasone</b> is applied to the skin it works by acting inside the cells to decrease the release of these inflammatory substances. This reduces swelling, redness and itch. <b>Betamethasone</b> is a potent corticosteroid.The combination of <b>betamethasone</b> and fusidic acid is used to treat eczema that is infected with bacteria. The <b>betamethasone</b> reduces the inflammation in the skin while the fusidic acid treats the infection.|$|E
