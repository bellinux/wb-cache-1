5|$|Vietnam {{developed}} little {{during the}} war years; industry was nearly non-existent in both North and South and both countries were dependent on foreign donor countries. Worse, the country's critical agricultural infrastructure had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> damaged. The South had roughly 20,000 bomb craters, 10 million refugees, 362,000 war invalids, 1,000,000 widows, 880,000 orphans, 250,000 drug addicts, 300,000 prostitutes and 3 million unemployed.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Q'umarkaj is {{the best}} known of the Late Postclassic {{highland}} Maya capitals. The earliest reference to the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés' letters from Mexico. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> damaged by the looting of stone to build the nearby town of Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{function}} u on {{the unit}} circle T is said to <b>be</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in the weighted space Lp(T, w) if ‖u+ f‖Lp(T,w) ≥ ‖u‖Lp(T,w) for all f ∈ H∞. We prove that if an unimodular function u <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞) and some non-zero weight w, then u is an inner function. We describe the inner functions Θ and the weights w {{on the unit}} circle T such that Θ <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p> 0. It turns out that, for given inner functions Θ, the class of all weights satisfying the above-mentioned condition depends only on the zero set of Θ. In other words, Θ <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞) {{if and only if}} B <b>is</b> <b>badly</b> approximable in Lp(T, w) for all p ∈ (0,+∞), where B is a Blaschke product with simple zeros and such that Θ− 1 (0) = B− 1 (0) ...|$|R

5|$|Pintails in North America {{at least}} have <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> {{affected}} by avian diseases, with the breeding population falling from more than 10 million in 1957 to 3.5 million by 1964. Although the species has recovered from that low point, the breeding population in 1999 was 30% below the long-term average, despite years of major efforts focused on restoring the species. In 1997, an estimated 1.5million water birds, the majority being northern pintails, died from avian botulism during two outbreaks in Canada and Utah.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see the figures {{of a young man}} and a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|At {{the foot}} of the climb, the leading group only had a small {{advantage}} over the peloton and were soon caught. There were no lead-out trains in the final kilometres, with fewer than 60 riders left in the group. Tosh Van der Sande (Lotto-Soudal) was the first to sprint, but Kristian Sbaragli (MTN-Qhubeka) came past him and took the stage victory. Degenkolb was the quickest in the final metres, but he had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> positioned and was only able to finish second. José Joaquín Rojas (Movistar) finished third. The stage was Sbaragli's first win in over two years. It was the second win of his career and the first in a Grand Tour.|$|E

5|$|By the 21st century {{many of the}} Device Forts {{had been}} damaged by, {{or in some cases}} lost entirely, to coastal erosion; the problem had existed at some {{locations}} since the 16th century and still persists, for example at Hurst. East Cowes Castle and East Tilbury Fort have been entirely lost, while the East Blockhouse, Mersea and Sandsfoot have <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> damaged, a third of Sandgate and most of St Andrews have been washed away. Other sites were demolished, built upon or simply eroded over time; almost no trace remains of the bulwarks along the Downs, for example. The remaining sites are protected by UK conservation law, either as scheduled monuments or listed buildings.|$|E
5|$|Exeter had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> {{damaged in}} the battle with Admiral Graf Spee, and Dorsetshire escorted her back to Britain in January 1940, before {{returning}} to South American waters to search for German supply ships. On 11 February, her reconnaissance aircraft spotted the German supply freighter Wakama twelve {{miles off the coast}} of Brazil, which was promptly scuttled by her crew. Dorsetshire arrived on the scene shortly thereafter, picked up ten officers and thirty-five crewmen and sank Wakama to prevent her from being a navigational hazard. The following month, the President of Panama, Augusto Samuel Boyd, sent a formal complaint to the British government protesting against Dorsetshires violation of the Pan-American Security Zone in the Wakama incident.|$|E
5|$|Fiji's native birdlife has <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> {{affected}} by agriculture, deforestation and introduced pests like rats and mongooses. Although Important Bird Areas {{have been established}} on Taveuni and the forest east of Vanua Levu, conservation problems persist. The Fiji parrotfinch has adapted well to man-made landscapes; it is neither a ground nor hole nester, so it avoids predation from the mongoose and competition for nest sites with introduced common and jungle mynas. Introduced rodents are able to access the nests and may affect breeding productivity. The potential introduction of other species, such as snakes, or diseases like avian malaria could lead to major losses among bird species.|$|E

5|$|Helmut Lent {{was ordered}} to {{intercept}} and engage the attacking bomber force and after refuelling—Lent had just landed at Jever from an armed patrol—claimed three Wellingtons, two of which, shot down at 14:30 and 14:45, were later confirmed. The two aircraft were both from No. 37 Squadron, captained by Flying Officer P.A. Wimberley and Flying Officer O.J.T. Lewis respectively, and both crashed in the shallow sea off Borkum. It is likely that his third claim may have been No. 37 Squadron Wellington 1A N2396, LF-J, piloted by Sergeant H. Ruse, which crash-landed on the sand dunes of Borkum. Lent was refused the victory over Wimberley, as the Wellington was attacked by Lent after it had already <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> damaged {{and was about to}} crash. The Wellington was credited to pilot Carl-August Schumacher.|$|E

L Dubba E tries to kill JTRO, triggering a lengthy gunfight between the 248 and the 245.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{served with}} the Kentucky militia during the Northwest Indian War. He was a {{subaltern}} in Arthur St. Clair's army in the American defeat at the Battle of the Wabash on November 4, 1791. During the retreat, a soldier named William Kennan found Madison sitting on a log. Kennan was being pursued by Indians and admonished Madison to run, but Madison, who was already known to be of frail constitution, stood to reveal that he had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> wounded and was bleeding profusely. Kennan quickly retrieved an abandoned horse he had seen; he helped Madison astride the horse, and they both escaped.|$|E

5|$|On December 16, 1902, Sebree {{was granted}} {{a leave of absence}} to return to the United States and care for his wife who had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> hurt in a fall. In his place, Lieutenant Commander Henry Minett, Sebree's {{executive}} officer, was made acting commandant of the station and therefore acting governor of the territory. He was also given command of the Wheeling. Captain Edmund Beardsley Underwood was selected as Sebree's replacement, but that decision was not made official immediately, and Underwood remained in Washington to consult with Sebree and President Roosevelt on the governance of the territory. Underwood's selection was not announced until May 1903.|$|E
5|$|On New Year's Day 1911 {{the body}} of Léon Beron, a Russian Jewish immigrant, was found on Clapham Common in South London. He had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> beaten and two S-shaped cuts, both two inches long, were on his cheeks. The case became {{connected}} in the press with the Houndsditch murders and the subsequent events at Sidney Street, although the evidence at {{the time for the}} link was scant. The historian FG Clarke, in his history of the events, located information from another Latvian who stated that Beron had been killed not because {{he was one of the}} informers who had passed on information, but because he was planning to pass the information on, and the act was a pre-emptive one, designed to scare the locals into not informing on the anarchists.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{completion}} of the project's first phase, the vicinity around the Wazir Khan mosque had been encroached upon by illegally erected shops which blocked off much of the mosque from the surrounding neighborhood. Tangled power lines further spoiled views of the mosque, and the Wazir Khan Chowk had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> neglected and had shrunk in size due to illegally constructed shops. The {{first phase of the}} project removed illegally constructed shops, restoring views of the mosque. Wazir Khan Chowk was extensively rehabilitated by removal of encroachments, while the well of Dina Nath was restored. Power lines along the project corridor were also placed underground, and the Chitta Gate at the eastern entrance to Wazir Khan Chowk was rehabilitated.|$|E

5|$|The French victory {{had come}} at a heavy cost: more than 160 men were killed and 300 wounded and all three French ships had been {{severely}} damaged. Among the dead were the captains of both Formidable and Indomptable, although Linois was unhurt. The Spanish had suffered eleven men killed and five gunboats had been destroyed. The batteries and town had also <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> damaged in the fighting. British losses were also heavy, with more than 130 killed and more than 230 wounded, most {{of which had been}} lost on Hannibal and Pompée. In addition to the loss of Hannibal, Pompée was severely damaged and the remainder of the British squadron all required urgent repairs.|$|E
5|$|The area {{appears to}} have been of some {{importance}} in the early Christian period, as evidenced by the Pictish stone carvings found during the restoration of St Vigeans Church, and now housed in the small museum there. The stones had been used in the building of the old church and many had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> damaged. One of the stones, the 9th century Drosten Stone, has the distinction of being one of the few Pictish artefacts to have an inscription in Latin text: 'DROSTEN: IREUORET TTFOR CUS', which has been interpreted in various ways, but it is thought to refer to the Pictish King Uurad, who reigned between 839 and 842AD.|$|E
5|$|Contre-Admiral Leissègues' {{squadron}} was unchanged {{from the}} force that left Brest on 13 December. All ships however, especially Jupiter and Diomède, had <b>been</b> <b>badly</b> damaged by storms off the Azores in late December and repairs were incomplete {{by the time of}} Duckworth's attack, most the fleet still undergoing caulking at Santo Domingo. Recognising that if he was caught at anchor he would be destroyed, Leissègues sent orders from his offices in Santo Domingo for the fleet to sail, joining them later by small boat. Trapped against the land with the wind from the west, Leissègues had no option but to form a line of battle and wait to meet the British squadron. Although his ships fought hard, they were unable to mutually support one another and were rapidly overwhelmed: three surrendered, while Diomède and Impérial were driven ashore and wrecked to prevent their capture. The only ships to escape were the two frigates and a corvette that and slipped between the French line and the land early in the battle and made sail to the west, eventually reaching France.|$|E
