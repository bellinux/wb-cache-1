This first dream [...] "left a profound impression on him for the rest of his life", according to his own memoirs. Bosco apparently saw a multitude of very poor boys who play and blaspheme, and a man, who [...] "appeared, nobly attired, with a manly and imposing bearing". The man said to him: [...] "You will have to win these friends of yours not with blows, but with gentleness and kindness. So <b>begin</b> <b>right</b> <b>now</b> to show them that sin is ugly and virtue beautiful." ...|$|R

50|$|On the mission, they {{encounter}} and kill a German soldier together. The duo establishes themselves at 2 AM {{in the church}} tower, calls in, and reports their observations, especially that a hidden section of the village contains an enormous German artillery/ammo dump. Loggins sends an order back to the base to begin a bombardment at 4 AM that will certainly destroy most of the village. They leave the tower, and are soon discovered by a German patrol. Harris is shot by the Germans and dies after Loggins drags {{him out of the}} line of fire, but Loggins is pinned down. The German officers, panicking at the thought of American soldiers in the village, order an immediate evacuation. Hearing this, Loggins grabs the radio and tells the US artillery to <b>begin</b> firing <b>right</b> <b>now.</b> Shells fall on the village and the ammo dump, and everything blows up.|$|R
40|$|The {{main idea}} of this project is to show the {{differences}} between two European countries, Poland and Germany in their law structure about environment. This differences (if they are) {{may be caused by}} this, that Poland has joined European Community four years ago, and Germany is under Union’s law since it’s <b>beginning,</b> anyway, <b>right</b> <b>now</b> two of them are together under Union’s law, so in many ways they should manage the same. However, if you’ll look at the map, you can see that these two big countries are neighbours, so in some other ways they can be connected with themselves, also by lines of water, crossing through this part of Europe. It is good to show, how the governmets and people care about their natural resources, that are very valuable in our times. The best way to show differences is to compare water resources by numbers. That kind of informations can give a conclusion, what should be done better and in what way, the science can help in decreasing water waste or pollution...|$|R
5000|$|Randy Lewis of the LA Times {{was highly}} {{impressed}} with the track and wrote: [...] "In [...] "Try Sleeping With a Broken Heart," [...] she's crafted an intriguing refrain: [...] "I'm gonna {{find a way to}} make it without you [...] [...] [...]," [...] admitting she's still searching for a full-fledged sense of security in whatever newfound freedom she's come into. But then she extends the thought with the kicker word [...] "[...] [...] tonight." [...] Is she taking the one-day-at-a-time approach of a 12-step program for romantic addiction? Is it merely the application of an emotional band-aid? Or might she be asserting that the path to true independence always <b>begins</b> <b>right</b> here, <b>right</b> <b>now?</b> It's never entirely clear, and the ambiguity makes the song that much richer.". PopJustice said that the song is the album's [...] "secret weapon" [...] and called it [...] "amazing", adding that it's [...] "a head-explodingly brilliant, timeless 'n' modern R&B ballad". Slant magazine said that [...] "The best moments on Freedom come early, with the clear standout being [...] "Try Sleeping with a Broken Heart." [...] There, some retro synth work lends a funky backdrop for Keys's breathy vamping, alternating disco-diva choruses with Prince-worthy verses". Robert Copsey of Digital Spy gave the song four out of five stars, branding it as one of the stand out tracks from the album. He also stated that the verses were good because of Keys's breathy vocals with military-style drumming in the background, he felt the chorus was full of [...] "palpable emotion". Overall, he branded the song as an [...] "effortless and timeless power ballad".|$|R
