5|$|Below and {{in front}} of the {{striatum}} are a number of <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain</b> structures. These include the nucleus accumbens, nucleus basalis, diagonal band of Broca, substantia innominata, and the medial septal nucleus. These structures are important in producing the neurotransmitter, acetylcholine, which is then distributed widely throughout the brain. The <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain,</b> in particular the nucleus basalis, is considered to be the major cholinergic output of the central nervous system to the striatum and neocortex.|$|E
5|$|The {{olfactory}} system {{is made up}} in part of the RMS which stretches from the subventricular zone in {{the wall of the}} lateral ventricle, through the <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain,</b> to the olfactory bulb (OB). VONS is the name given to this pathway, and it consists of the subventricular zone, the RMS, the olfactory tract and the olfactory bulb. Developing neurons leave the subventricular zone and enter the RMS and travel caudally and ventrally along the undersurface of the caudate nucleus; this {{is referred to as the}} descending limb. Upon reaching the ventral side of the caudate nucleus, the neurons follow the rostral limb and travel ventrally and rostrally, entering the anterior olfactory cortex (AOC). The AOC gives rise to the olfactory tract, which ends in the olfactory bulb.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{is connected}} by the brainstem to the spinal cord. The brainstem {{consists of the}} midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata. The cerebellum {{is connected to the}} brainstem by pairs of tracts. Within the cerebrum is the ventricular system, consisting of four interconnected ventricles in which cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Underneath the cerebral cortex are several important structures, including the thalamus, the epithalamus, the pineal gland, the hypothalamus, the pituitary gland, and the subthalamus; the limbic structures, including the amygdala and the hippocampus; the claustrum, the various nuclei of the basal ganglia; the <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain</b> structures, and the three circumventricular organs. The cells of the brain include neurons and supportive glial cells. There are more than 86 billion neurons in the brain, and a more or less equal number of other cells. Brain activity is made possible by the interconnections of neurons and their release of neurotransmitters in response to nerve impulses. Neurons form elaborate neural networks of neural pathways and circuits. The whole circuitry is driven by the process of neurotransmission.|$|E
50|$|Dysregulation of NGF {{signaling}} {{has also}} been linked to Alzheimer's disease. Connective tissue cells genetically engineered to synthesize and secrete NGF and implanted in patients' <b>basal</b> <b>forebrains</b> reliably pumped out NGF, which enhanced the cells’ size {{and their ability to}} sprout new neural fibers. The treatment also rescued vulnerable cells, even if they already showed the trademark signs of Alzheimer’s pathology. In some patients, these beneficial effects lasted almost 10 years after the treatment. Even patients who died responded positively to the therapy. Even pathological cells with protein clumps in their cell bodies and surroundings extended their fibers toward the NGF source, maintained a healthy size and activated pro-survival signals that boosted their stress resilience. Two other patients received direct injections of modified viruses containing the NGF gene directly to their <b>basal</b> <b>forebrains.</b> This allowed the gene to express longer in the brain.|$|R
2500|$|The {{basal ganglia}} (or basal nuclei) {{is a group}} of {{subcortical}} nuclei, of varied origin, in the brains of vertebrates including humans, which are situated {{at the base of the}} <b>forebrain.</b> <b>Basal</b> ganglia are strongly interconnected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus, and brainstem, as well as several other brain areas. The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of functions including: control of voluntary motor movements, procedural learning, routine behaviors or [...] "habits" [...] such as teeth grinding, eye movements, cognition, and emotion.|$|R
40|$|Stimulation at 14 of 106 loci (Figs. 1 and 2) {{at which}} {{electrodes}} had been chronically implanted elicited immediate feeding in fully satiated, freely moving cats. Half of the effective points {{were in the}} lateral hypothalamus and thus agreed with expectations from extensive prior research on the neural organization of feeding behavior. The other points, however, were in the ventral tegmental area or at the ventrolateral boundary of the central gray. The distribution of all effective points could be explained as following a projection pathway from the globus pallidus. Exploration along 162 recording tracks in acute experiments on these same cats revealed no consistent differences in projection of evoked potentials which could distinguish stimulation at effective versus ineffective loci. Potentials of possible significance, however, were evoked in the paramedial nucleus reticularis of the medulla, the rostral pontine nuclei, the nucleus centralis superior of Bekterev, the lateral frontal cortex and the <b>basal</b> medial <b>forebrain</b> {{in the vicinity of}} the diagonal band of Broca...|$|R
5|$|There is {{speculation}} {{of several}} {{mechanisms by which}} the brain cells could be lost. One mechanism consists of an abnormal accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein bound to ubiquitin in the damaged cells. This insoluble protein accumulates inside neurones forming inclusions called Lewy bodies. According to the Braak staging, a classification of the disease based on pathological findings, Lewy bodies first appear in the olfactory bulb, medulla oblongata and pontine tegmentum; individuals at this stage may be asymptomatic or may have early non-motor symptoms (such as loss of sense of smell, or some sleep or automatic dysfunction). As the disease progresses, Lewy bodies develop in the substantia nigra, areas of the midbrain and <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain</b> and, finally, the neocortex. These brain sites are the main places of neuronal degeneration in PD; however, Lewy bodies may not cause cell death {{and they may be}} protective (with the abnormal protein sequestered or walled off). Other forms of alpha-synuclein (e.g., oligomers) that are not aggregated in Lewy bodies and Lewy neurites may actually be the toxic forms of the protein. In people with dementia, a generalized presence of Lewy bodies is common in cortical areas. Neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques, characteristic of Alzheimer's disease, are not common unless the person is demented.|$|E
25|$|The pontomesencephalotegmental complex acts {{mainly on}} M1 receptors in the brainstem, deep {{cerebellar}} nuclei, pontine nuclei, locus coeruleus, raphe nucleus, lateral reticular nucleus and inferior olive.

40|$|Over {{the past}} four decades songbirds have become a widely used model {{organism}} for neuroscientists studying complex sequential behaviors and sensory-guided motor learning. Like human babies, young songbirds learn many of the sounds they use for communication by imitating adults. This remark-able behavior emerges as a product of genetic predispositions and specifi c individual experiences. Research on different aspects of this behavior has elucidated key principles that may underlie vertebrate motor learning and motor perfor-mance in general, including (1) the mechanisms by which neural circuits generate sequential behaviors, (2) the exis-tence of specialized neuronal circuits for the generation of exploratory variability, (3) the importance of <b>basal</b> ganglia– <b>forebrain</b> circuits for learning sequentially patterned behav-iors, including speech and language, and (4) the existence of genetic toolkits that may have been coopted multiple times during evolution {{to play a role in}} learned vocal communica-tion, such as the transcription factor FoxP 2 and its molecular targets.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of cannabinoid receptors {{has led to}} the identification of two natural activators for these receptors, anandamide and 2 -arachidonoylglycerol, and to the elucidation of their biochemical pathways of formation and inactivation. Although the physiological significance of the endogenous cannabinoid system is still poorly understood, important information is becoming available on the possible functional roles of this system in the <b>basal</b> ganglia, a <b>forebrain</b> region that is involved in the control of sensorimotor and motivational aspects of behavior. These discoveries - which are going to enrich {{the way in which we}} look at basal ganglia functions - are summarized in this mini-review. The role of the endocannabinoids as modulators of psychomotor behaviors and the potential therapeutic perspectives deriving from the pharmacological manipulation of the endogenous cannabinoid system are also discussed.

40|$|There is {{substantial}} evidence supporting {{a role for}} the endocannabinoid system as a modulator of the dopaminergic activity in the <b>basal</b> ganglia, a <b>forebrain</b> system that integrates cortical information to coordinate motor activity regulating signals. In fact, the administration of plant-derived, synthetic or endogenous cannabinoids produces several effects on motor function. These effects are mediated primarily through the CB 1 receptors that are densely located in the dopamine-enriched basal ganglia networks, suggesting that the motor effects of endocannabinoids are due, at least in part, to modulation of dopaminergic transmission. On the other hand, there are profound changes in CB 1 receptor cannabinoid signaling in the basal ganglia circuits after dopamine depletion (as happens in Parkinson&# 180;s disease) and following L-DOPA replacement therapy. Therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that endocannabinoid system modulation may constitute an important component in new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of motor disturbances. In this article we will review studies supporting the endocannabinoid modulation of dopaminergic motor circuits...|$|R
25|$|One neurochemical {{indicator}} of sleep debt is adenosine, a neurotransmitter that inhibits {{many of the}} bodily processes associated with wakefulness. Adenosine levels increase in the cortex and <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain</b> during prolonged wakefulness and decrease during the sleep-recovery period, potentially acting as a homeostatic regulator of sleep. Coffee and caffeine temporarily block the effect of adenosine, prolong sleep latency, and reduce total sleep time and quality.|$|E
25|$|A {{limited number}} of cases have been {{described}} in which patients with damage {{to other parts of}} the brain acquired anterograde amnesia. Easton and Parker observed damage to either the hippocampus or the surrounding cortices does not seem to result in severe amnesia in primate models. They suggested damage to the hippocampus and surrounding structures alone does not explain the amnesia they saw in patients, or increasing damage does not correlate with the degree of impairment. Furthermore, the data do not explain the dichotomy that exists in the MTL memory system between episodic and semantic memory. To demonstrate their hypothesis, they used a primate model with damage to the <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain.</b> They proposed that the disruption of neurons that project from the <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain</b> to the MTL are responsible for some of the impairment in anterograde amnesia. Easton and Parker also reported MRI scans of patients with severe anterograde amnesia showed damage beyond to cortical areas around the hippocampus and amygdala (a region of brain involved in emotions) and to surrounding white matter (white matter in the brain consists of axons, long projections of neuronal cell bodies).|$|E
25|$|NREM {{sleep is}} {{characterized}} by decreased global and regional cerebral blood flow. Non-REM sleep which constitutes ~80% of all sleep in humans. Initially, {{it was expected that}} the brainstem, which was implicated in arousal would be inactive, but this was later on found to have been due to low resolution of PET studies and it was shown that there is some slow wave activity in the brainstem as well. However, other parts of the brain, including the precuneus, <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain</b> and basal ganglia are deactivated during sleep. Many areas of the cortex are also inactive, but to different levels. For example, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is considered the least active area while the primary cortex, the least deactivated.|$|E
40|$|Neurobehavioral {{data from}} intact, decerebrate, and {{neonatal}} rats {{suggests that the}} reticular formation provides a brainstem substrate for action selection in the vertebrate central nervous system. In this article, Kilmer, McCulloch and Blum’s (1969) landmark reticular formation model (see also Kilmer, 1997) is described and re-evaluated, both in simulation and, for the first time, as a mobile robot con-troller. Particular model configurations are found to provide effective action selection mechanisms in a robot survival task using either simulated or physical robots. The model’s competence {{is dependent on the}} organization of afferents from model sensory systems, and a genetic algorithm search identi-fied a class of afferent configurations which have long survival times. The results support our proposal that the reticular formation evolved to provide effective arbitration between innate behaviors and, with the <b>forebrain</b> <b>basal</b> ganglia, may constitute the integrative, “centrencephalic ” core of vertebrate brain architecture. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the Kilmer et al. model provides an alternative form of robot controller to those usually considered in the adaptive behavior literature.

25|$|The {{pathophysiology}} of anterograde amnesic syndromes {{varies with}} the extent of damage and the regions {{of the brain that}} were damaged. The most well-described regions indicated in this disorder are the medial temporal lobe (MTL), <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain,</b> and fornix. Beyond the details described below, the precise process of how we remember– on a micro scale– remains a mystery. Neuropsychologists and scientists are still not in total agreement over whether forgetting is due to faulty encoding, accelerated forgetting, or faulty retrieval, although a great deal of data seem to point to the encoding hypothesis. In addition, neuroscientists are also in disagreement about the length of time involved in memory consolidation. Though most researchers, including Hasselmo et al., have found the consolidation process is spread out over several hours before transitioning from a fragile to a more permanent state, others, including Brown et al., posit that memory consolidation can take months or even years in a drawn-out process of consolidation and reinforcement. Further research into the length of time of memory consolidation will shed more light on why anterograde amnesia sometimes affects some memories gained after the event(s) that caused the amnesia, but does not affect other such memories.|$|E
25|$|REM Stage (REM Sleep – 20–25% {{of total}} sleep in adults): REM sleep is where most muscles are paralyzed, and heart rate, {{breathing}} and body temperature become unregulated. REM sleep {{is turned on}} by acetylcholine secretion and is inhibited by neurons that secrete monoamines including serotonin. REM is {{also referred to as}} paradoxical sleep because the sleeper, although exhibiting high-frequency EEG waves similar to a waking state, is harder to arouse than at any other sleep stage. Vital signs indicate arousal and oxygen consumption by the brain is higher than when the sleeper is awake. REM sleep is characterized by high global cerebral blood flow, comparable to wakefulness. In fact, many areas in the cortex have been recorded to have more blood flow during REM sleep than even wakefulness- this includes the hippocampus, temporal-occipital areas, some parts of the cortex, and <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain.</b> The limbic and paralimbic system including the amygdala are other active regions during REM sleep. Though the brain activity during REM sleep appears very similar to wakefulness, the main difference between REM and wakefulness is that, arousal in REM is more effectively inhibited. This, along with the virtual silence of monoaminergic neurons in the brain, may be said to characterize REM.|$|E

2500|$|... miRNAs can {{be either}} {{upregulated}} or downregulated in response to chronic alcohol use. miR-206 expression increased in the prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent rats, targeting the transcription factor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and ultimately reducing its expression. BDNF plays {{a critical role in}} the formation and maturation of new neurons and synapses, suggesting a possible implication in synapse growth/synaptic plasticity in alcohol abusers. miR-155, important in regulating alcohol-induced neuroinflammation responses, was found to be upregulated, suggesting the role of microglia and inflammatory cytokines in alcohol pathophysiology. Downregulation of miR-382 was found in the nucleus accumbens, a structure in the <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain</b> significant in regulating feelings of reward that power motivational habits. miR-382 is the target for the dopamine receptor D1 (DRD1), and its overexpression results in the upregulation of DRD1 and delta fosB, a transcription factor that activates a series of transcription events in the nucleus accumbens that ultimately result in addictive behaviors. Alternatively, overexpressing miR-382 resulted in attenuated drinking and the inhibition of DRD1 and delta fosB upregulation in rat models of alcoholism, demonstrating the possibility of using miRNA-targeted pharmaceuticals in treatments.|$|E
2500|$|The {{amygdala}} is {{a complex}} set of nuclei situated in the anterior temporal lobe and lies beneath the primary olfactory cortex.

[...] There are also direct projections to the hippocampus from the amygdala, which are involved in the integration of various sensations into memory. [...] Neuropsychological research has suggested that this pathway is vital for the development of olfactory memories. The primary olfactory cortex and the hippocampus have extensive connections with the amygdala through both indirect and direct pathways. [...] It is important for an animal to create memories of olfactory stimuli which threaten its survival.

2500|$|The {{effects of}} REM sleep {{deprivation}} (RSD) on neurotrophic [...] factors, specifically nerve growth factor (NGF) and {{brain-derived neurotrophic factor}} (BDNF), were assessed in 2000 by Sie et el. [...] Neurotrophins are proteins found {{in the brain and}} periphery that aid in the survival, functioning and generation of neurons; this is an important element in the synaptic plasticity process, the underlying neurochemical foundation in forming memories. Sei et al., inserted electrodes into the skulls of seven pairs of rats to measure Electroencephalogram (EEG), and inserted wire into the neck muscles of the rats to measure Electromyogram (EMG), a technique used to measure the amount of muscle activity. [...] Half the rats experienced a six-hour REM sleep deprivation period, while the other half experienced a six-hour sleep period, containing all sleep cycles. [...] Results showed that in the rats in the REM sleep deprivation group showed decreased level of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the cerebellum (coordination, motor learning) and brainstem (sensory and motor ascending pathway), conversely the hippocampus (long-term memory, spatial navigation), showed decreases in nerve growth factor levels. [...] BDNF protein {{has been shown to be}} necessary for procedural learning (form of non-declarative memory). [...] Since procedural learning has also exhibited consolidation and enhancement under REM sleep, it is proposed that the impairment of procedural learning tasks is due to the lack of BDNF proteins in the cerebellum and brainstem during RSD. [...] In regards to NGF, the <b>basal</b> <b>forebrain</b> (production and distribution of AcH in the brain), more specifically the medial septal area, sends cholinergic (excitatory in hippocampus) and GABAinergic (inhibitory) neurotransmitters through fibres to the hippocampus target cells. [...] These target cells then secrete NGF which plays a key role in the physiological state of the hippocampus and its functions. [...] It has been noted that REM sleep increases the secretion of NGF, therefore it has been proposed that during RSD cholinergic activity decreases leading to a decrease in NGF and impairment in procedural learning.|$|E
