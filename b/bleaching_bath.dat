40|$|Hydrogen {{peroxide}} {{is commonly}} used bleaching agent for textiles. Dyeing after bleaching requires repeatedly rinsing the textile material to remove any residue of peroxide that might be harmful to the dyes either in solution or on the fabric. 1, 2 Even this washing process cannot guarantee the complete removal of the peroxide. Contemporary biotechnology offers the opportunity to reduce the large water consumption required for washing {{by the use of}} catalases for peroxide decomposition. Catalase is known for its ability to catalyze the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water and gaseous oxygen. 3, 4 There are two possible approaches for applying this enzyme prior to dyeing-draining off the <b>bleach</b> <b>bath</b> and refilling it with water containing the enzyme or adding the enzyme directly to the bleaching liquor and then reusing it for dyeing.

Soils watered with greywater systems can be amended with gypsum (calcium sulfate) to reduce pH. Cleaning products containing ammonia are safe to use, as plants can use it to obtain nitrogen. A 2010 study of greywater irrigation found no major health effects on plants, and suggests sodium buildup is largely dependent on the degree to which greywater migrates vertically through the soil.|$|R

40|$|Appropriate {{cleaning}} and disinfection procedures in zebrafish (Danio rerio) laboratories are crucial in preventing the spread of aquatic animal pathogens and minimizing the build-up of waste products and biologic matter. The procedures selected should accomplish these goals and incorporate the individual needs of various laboratories. In this study of a single zebrafish facility, we assessed the efficacy of 2 different {{cleaning and}} disinfection procedures for nets, tanks, and lids. ATP levels were used as a surrogate biomarker for microbial burden. We measured the number of relative light units (RLU), {{as an expression of}} the amount of ATP present, on items before and after disinfection and calculated the percentage reduction. We compared daily replacement of a commercial net disinfection product in J lab with weekly replacement in H lab and found a 96. 6 % reduction in RLU in H lab and a 91. 2 % reduction in J lab.

Evaluation of tanks and lids soaked in a <b>bleach</b> disinfection <b>bath</b> for 30 or 60 min revealed a 99. 7 % reduction in RLU at 30 min compared with 97. 1 % at 60 min.

50|$|<b>Bleach</b> <b>baths</b> provide {{temporary}} {{control of}} eczema. Ciprofloxacin is an allergen that may cause contact dermatitis, symptoms {{of which are}} indistinguishable from eczema. Filaggrin mutations are associated with atopic eczema and {{may contribute to the}} excessive dryness of the skin and the loss of the barrier function of normal skin. It may be possible that the filaggrin mutations and the loss of the normal skin barrier expose crevices that make it possible for Staphylococcus aureus to colonize the skin. Atopic eczema is often associated with genetic defects in genes that control allergic responses. Thus, some investigators have proposed that atopic eczema is an allergic response to increased Staphylococcus aureus colonization of the skin. A hallmark indicator of atopic eczema is a positive “wheal-and-flare” reaction to a skin test of S. aureus antigens. In addition, several studies have documented that an IgE-mediated response to S. aureus is present in patients with atopic eczema.|$|R

50|$|Dilute <b>bleach</b> <b>baths</b> {{have been}} used for decades to treat {{moderate}} to severe eczema in humans, but it has not been clear why they work. According to work published by researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine in November 2013, a very dilute (0.005%) solution of sodium hypochlorite in water was successful in treating skin damage with an inflammatory component caused by radiation therapy, excess sun exposure or aging in laboratory mice. Mice with radiation dermatitis given daily 30-minute <b>baths</b> in <b>bleach</b> solution experienced less severe skin damage and better healing and hair regrowth than animals bathed in water. A molecule called nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) is known to {{play a critical role in}} inflammation, aging, and response to radiation. The researchers found that if NF-κB activity was blocked in elderly mice by bathing them in bleach solution, the animals' skin began to look younger, going from old and fragile to thicker, with increased cell proliferation. The effect diminished after the baths were stopped, indicating that regular exposure was necessary to maintain skin thickness.|$|R
