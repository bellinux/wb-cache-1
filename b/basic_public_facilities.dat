Unhindered informal/unplanned and formal/planned growth on its fragile ecology makes {{it one of the}} most vulnerable/unlivable cities on the planet in the face of climate change and other natural calamities. The present traffic scenario is connected with this explosive urban growth and has to be treated accordingly. Dhaka city's transport network awaits a big change, as the government plans seven metro-rail and bus rapid transit routes under an integrated mass traffic system. Government officials said the state-run Dhaka Transport Coordination Authority (DTCA) and the Roads and Highways Department (RHD) would construct three metro rail transit (MRT) and four bus rapid transit (BRT) lines to ease traffic snarls in the busy metropolis.

40|$|Health {{promotion}} aims {{to improve}} the health of whole populations. Before the 1970 s there was a three-pronged approach to addressing health and illness: providing communities with <b>basic</b> <b>public</b> health <b>facilities</b> (such as clean water and sewerage); providing hospital-based services; and providing health education. The philosophy of health promotion has developed since the 1970 s and now reflects a social model of health, or what has commonly {{come to be known}} as the new public health approach. This approach was intended to change the health agenda towards community participation and empowerment, and wider social and environmental change. In Australia and elsewhere, though, health promotion in practice has essentially remained committed to old-style health educationm despite much rhetoric to the contary.

40|$|AbstractThis {{article is}} {{considering}} impacts of urban spread on built-up area and mobility. It describes urban and social changes of spread of urbanized areas, {{while the number}} of residents does not grow, since in Slovakia, similarly in neighbouring countries, the number of inhabitants slightly diminishes during the recent decades. It is therefore natural that many, especially rural and small urban settlements are disappearing. On the other hand, the traffic volume increases and generates various difficulties relating to effective serviceability of urbanized zone. Extensive expansion of urbanized areas provokes deurbanisation processes. It transforms traditional towns/villages and jeopardizes their sustainability. Traffic organisation and mobility modify themselves, because of decreasing of population density and extension of within walking distances. Modifications reflected: in the increasing demands on traffic volume capacity (in inner town, as well as between the satellite towns and their maternal core town), in the higher requirements for parking places and in an inefficient public transport. In this article we focus on situation in two selected Slovak towns: Senica and Liptovsky Mikulas, and analysing them as a case studies. The mentioned towns plan their great urban extension, so we focused on the changes of urban structure and organisation of transport. Case studies have been assessed from these aspects: 1. Analysis of the existing Land-use plan enables to visualise the planned expansion of the town. The types of planned extending zones have been properly classified. 2. Obtained results have been confronted with statistic data, concerning demographic evolution for at least 10 recent years. Changes of population density have been calculated from the obtained data. 3. The presented analysis deals with current traffic situation, using also the measured data of traffic intensity from recent years. Emerging urban structures bite from arable soil or pastures, and they have neither features of urban nor rural type. The hybrid forms of settlement occur, characterized by monotonous structures, lacking the <b>basic</b> <b>public</b> <b>facilities</b> and spatial hierarchy. A separate chapter is the lack of social contacts. These urban structures dispose a high degree of anonymity, lack of interest to the living environment and they have a problem to adopt. Mentioned types of urban structure are the most similar with suburban habitations but without facilities and public transport. The population density of the mentioned structures is very low. Impact on the traffic system is reflected by increasing of individual automobile transport which allows the optimal personal mobility. Usually there are inappropriate opportunities for bikes and other non-motor ways of transport...|$|E
40|$|The {{promulgation}} of extended-decentralization {{policy has}} brought about the competition climate among district/city governments in delivering public services. The capacity to accomplish public tasks, however, tends to be insufficient.

In the East Kalimantan case, the tradition of conducting public affairs through collaborative management seems to be disregarded. Nevertheless, the prospect to intensify regional cooperation is fairly promising. This paper examines the likely development cooperation among three autonomous regions, i. e.

40|$|The {{government}} of Malaysia {{has introduced a}} new method of land development namely Sistem Pembangunan Tanah Bersepakat (PTB). This method is a very suitable way to develop remote areas that are far from such a more sound enviroment. This system of PTB is also a new method of land development especially in the rearrangement of land in this country {{where some of the}} unsystematically developed land and those undeveloping have been rearranged with the adequate supplement of <b>basic</b> and <b>public</b> <b>facilities</b> through the collaboration and agreement from the land’s owner. As a return of some contributed lands, the owners will be received compensation in the form of properties and other forms of incentives. Another lands will be formed as financial land and will be sell in the market in order to support some cost of project development. This financial land can be in the form of empty lots or treasuries that has been developed. From this conducted research, it can be concluded that, in overall, this system of PTB is such a comprehensive system of land development, but, this system needs to be supported by a specific law or act. This is because, this system is very hard to attain an agreement from all of the land owners. Therefore, this research suggests some actions to improve the current law of this PTB’s system. The research found some problems in PTB’s system are because of elements of PTB are not being allocated in any laws in this country. Furthermore, to initiate a project in PTB which includes a research and construction, one round-financial fund (or one cycle-financial fund) should be formed by the federal goverment to promote the smoothness of this project’s development. This fund will be act as a resource to provide an interest-free loan to PTB’s projects while waiting for the influx of project’s financial resource via the financial land’s sale...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To compare availability, cost, {{affordability}} {{and sources}} of anti-diabetic drugs between private and <b>public</b> health <b>facilities</b> in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. DESIGN: Cross sectional descriptive study. SETTING: Diabetic clinics in private and <b>public</b> health <b>facilities</b> in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. SUBJECTS: Eighty patients randomly selected and 45 health facility personnel staff working in the diabetic clinics. Semi-structured questionnaires and a checklist were used to collect the information. RESULTS: Oral hypoglycaemic agents were available in all seven private and three <b>public</b> <b>facilities</b> that were studied. Private facilities stocked more types of oral hypoglycaemic agents than <b>public</b> <b>facilities,</b> which stocked only chlorpropamide and tolbutamide, based on the National Essential Drugs List. The cost of chlorpropamide was five times higher in private <b>facilities</b> compared to <b>public</b> <b>facilities.</b> Insulin was also available in all the facilities. The price of animal insulin in private health facilities was ten times that in <b>public</b> health <b>facilities.</b> Human insulin, which is generally more expensive than animal insulin, was only available in private facilities. Although prices were much lower in <b>public</b> <b>facilities,</b> affordability emerged as a common issue in both private and <b>public</b> <b>facilities.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Urban private health facilities offer a wider choice {{for the needs of}} diabetic patients but this advantage is compromised by higher prices as compared to <b>public</b> <b>facilities</b> as well as inconsistent supply across <b>facilities.</b> <b>Public</b> health <b>facilities</b> offer only a limited selection of essential oral hypoglycaemics and insulin but at a lower price and across all facilities. Twenty six per cent and 10 % of patients in <b>public</b> and private <b>facilities</b> respectively are unable to afford anti-diabetic drugs. The need for intervention to increase affordability of anti-diabetic drugs is evident.
