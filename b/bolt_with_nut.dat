Although {{they are}} usually used to attach pipe and {{fittings}} to mechanical supports in buildings, they do not connect the pipes to each other. Fasteners commonly used with piping are a stud <b>bolt</b> <b>with</b> <b>nuts</b> (usually fully threaded, with two heavy, hexagonal nuts); a machine bolt and nut; or a powder-actuated tool (PAT) fastener (usually a nail or threaded stud, driven into concrete or masonry).|$|R

In 2006, Joe opened a {{physical}} museum at the Sherline factory in Vista, California. Within 4 years, the museum outgrew their factory home and Joe decided to create the Joe Martin foundation to purchase a 16,000 square foot building in the Raceway industrial park as a permanent home for the Museum in Carlsbad, just a couple miles from the Sherline factory. Over the years the Museum has expanded its collection of exhibits to include hundreds of working models {{of all types of}} miniature machines, engines, architecture, automobiles, and airplanes as well as one-off unique articles of miniature engineering craftsmanship such as a 0.010” diameter <b>bolt</b> <b>with</b> matching <b>nut.</b>|$|R

50|$|The term {{is usually}} a misnomer, {{introduced}} mostly by Fender whose guitars traditionally had what is called bolt-on necks. Real bolted joints (i.e., using <b>bolt</b> coupled <b>with</b> a <b>nut)</b> exist—particularly in acoustic guitars—but are less common in electric guitars. However, at least one aftermarket manufacturer offers a replacement for Fender neckplates and screws that uses captive inserts—embedded in the guitar body {{by means of an}} external self-tapping thread — and M4 machine screws. The maker claims this permits a higher fastening torque than ordinary wood screws, and hence a better coupling between neck and body.|$|R
50|$|The {{seat and}} the back panels are created by the cross pieces {{designed}} in a mold. In this way, the problematic sharp bend between the seat {{and the back}} is avoided {{and the length of}} individual rods is shortened. The seat and back are curved to the shape of the body. The rear legs extend into the armrest. The formation of this element requires high-quality wood with a good deal of waste involved.

40|$|The paper {{explores the}} effect of the thread pitch on the fatigue {{strength}} of ISO steel <b>bolts</b> fitted <b>with</b> standard <b>nuts.</b> By means of boundary element analyses and cross-comparison with theory and photoelasticity, the load capacity of the bolt is ultimately related to a comprehensive notch factor which embodies both stress concentration and notch sensitivity dependencies. The notch factor is conveniently plotted as a function of nominal diameter and thread pitch for a selection of steel grades. The charts show that the endurance load slightly increases as the pitch is decreased for small bolts of low-grade steel. Conversely, the endurance load markedly increases with the pitch (improvements above 40 per cent can be achieved) for large bolts of high-grade steel...|$|R

50|$|In {{the last}} few years of wooden boat construction, glue and screws took over, but until the 1950s, the keel, hog, stem, apron, deadwoods, sternpost, and perhaps transom would be {{fastened}} together by bolts set in white lead and grease. There are three kinds of bolt, of which, nowadays, the screw <b>bolt,</b> <b>with</b> its <b>nut</b> and washer, {{is by far the most}} common. The second type of bolt is the pin bolt or cotter bolt, which, instead of a thread, has a tapered hole forged through the end away from the head, into which a tapered pin or cotter is knocked. The taper is in effect a straight thread. In conjunction with a washer, this draws the bolt tight, as a nut does on a screw bolt. The third type of bolt is the clench bolt. It has some of the features of a rivet but was usually much longer than the normal rivet; in a wooden ship, perhaps a metre or more. For a shipwright's use, it is of copper. A head is formed by upsetting one end using a swage. It is then knocked through a hole bored through the work to be fastened, and through a washer. The head is held up with a dolly and the other end is upset over the washer in the same way as the head. Until well into the nineteenth century, this is what held the great ships of the world together, though some may have used iron. Until the late 1950s, the centre-line assembly of British Admiralty twenty-five foot motor cutters were fastened this way.|$|R

40|$|Direct tension {{indicators}} (DTIs) are one {{alternative method}} that {{is commonly used}} to verify that high-strength bolts have been properly tensioned during installation. This research attempts to resolve questions concerning the use of bolts {{which may have been}} overtensioned, as evidenced by DTIs which were completely flattened to zero DTI gaps. A variety of bolt and DTI combinations were tested to determine how far the nuts could rotate before the bolt fracnred. Sets of <b>bolts</b> and <b>nuts</b> <b>with</b> DTIs were then ten-sioned to the point of incipient failure and tested in single and double shear. These tests indicated there was no sig-nificant decrease in the single and double shear strengths of these over-tensioned bolts. ln addition, a series of tests compared the performance of DTls manufactured per ASTM F 959 - 90 to those manu-facnued per ASTM F 959 -%. These tests indicated that the F 959 - 96 DTIs exhibit less variability and indicate higher preloads at the specified DTI gaps compared to those manufactured to F 959 - 9 O...|$|R
40|$|Translocation of DNA or RNA is a {{ubiquitous}} phenomenon. One intricate translocation {{process is}} viral DNA packaging. During maturation, the lengthy genome of dsDNA viruses is translocated with remarkable velocity into a limited space within the procapsid. We {{have revealed that}} phi 29 DNA packaging is accomplished by a mechanism similar to driving a <b>bolt</b> <b>with</b> a hex <b>nut,</b> which consists of six DNA-packaging pRNAs. Four bases {{in each of the}} two pRNA loops are involved in RNA/RNA interactions to form a hexagonal complex that gears the DNA translocating machine. Without considering the tertiary interaction, in some cases only two G/C pairs between the interacting loops could provide certain pRNAs with activity. When all four bases were paired, at least one G/C pair was required for DNA packaging. The maximum number of base pairings between the two loops to allow pRNA to retain wild-type activity was five, whereas the minimum number was five for one loop and three for the other. The findings were supported by phylogenetic analysis of seven pRNAs from different phages. A 75 -base RNA segment, bases 23 - 97, was able to form dimer, to interlock into the hexamer, to compete with full-length pRNA for procapsid binding, and therefore to inhibit phi 29 assembly in vitro. Our result suggests that segment 23 - 97 is a self-folded, independent domain involved in procapsid binding and RNA/RNA interaction in dimer and hexamer formation, whereas bases 1 - 22 and 98 - 120 are involved in DNA translocation but dispensable for RNA/RNA interaction. Therefore, this 75 -base RNA could be a model for structural studies in RNA dimerization...|$|R
