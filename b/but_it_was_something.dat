With a record of 22-26-2-0, Pierce and the Centennials knew the rebuild would take some time <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> the organization knew patience would pay off for. The 2010-11 season would bring similar fortunes to Merritt, with a record of 22-31-6-1, but the upswing was clearly underway with a flock of young players on that seasons roster.|$|E
500|$|More {{than one}} hundred actors auditioned for the role, but only ten were taken seriously by the producers. Known actors such as Lou Diamond Phillips and Hart Bochner were among the auditionees for the role as Agent Doggett. Both Phillips and Bochner were {{considered}} for the role, but the producers eventually chose Robert Patrick. In an interview with, Chris Carter said [...] "I think {{it was something that}} we all talked about, but I wrote his voice. So, I think he was someone we all came up with together, but his voice came out of my head. <b>But,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that was helped in a large degree by casting Robert Patrick." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the changes}} to the show, Moffat wanted to reassure the {{audience}} that [...] "nothing has really been lost" [...] {{and it was the}} same show and the same character of the Doctor. The story arc of the cracks in the universe was inspired by a crack in the wall of Moffat's son's bedroom. Moffat wanted to make sure the show appealed to even young children; if they could not follow the plot, there would be [...] "big pictures" [...] to entertain them. Moffat believed that Doctor Who was fundamentally for children <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> everybody loved, comparing it to Star Wars and Toy Story. He considered the [...] "most popular form of entertainment" [...] to be a children's story. Of the series, he said they [...] "pushed the fairytale side of it" [...] as Doctor Who [...] "now has to be the most fantastical of the fantasy shows" [...] to be more vibrant and [...] "bonkers" [...] than any other fantastical show.|$|E

2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've never told anyone that I wanted to go back or {{anything}} like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was not an easy thing to do, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I had to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E
2500|$|After {{composing}} two songs, Jorgensen {{considered it}} [...] "easier" [...] writing {{from the perspective}} of being dead. He thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to expand it into a story where he kept [...] "pretending I was dead. I kinda creeped myself out sometimes." [...] Around this time, Jorgensen was going through a break-up [...] "of my first real relationship, which was heartbreaking," [...] combined with [...] "the fact that I had been touring {{for a couple of years}} with Armor for Sleep ... It was a very transitional period, and all those emotions converged." [...] He initially composed the songs before showing them to the rest of the band. Jorgensen wrote the lyrics in isolation. He later pondered [...] "maybe I should have asked for help <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> I wanted to be from me completely". According to Decicco, every song on the album is in Drop D tuning, often incorporating a ninth chord, which gave a [...] "super rich" [...] sound.|$|E
2500|$|Adams' {{retirement}} in May 2002 meant Vieira became club captain. He described the feeling as [...] "daunting", <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> he looked forward to: [...] "Taking the responsibility {{on my shoulders}} is something I relish. It will make me a better, more mature footballer and a more mature person as well." [...] Against Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in September 2002, Vieira was sent off for a late tackle on Gianfranco Zola; Arsenal's persistence nevertheless earnt them a point. In an interview with L'Équipe soon after, Vieira spoke of his desire to rest, as he felt [...] "burned out": [...] "I can hardly stand. My back aches, my legs hurt, it hurts all over. I'm going to see Arsène. He must give me time off to relax." [...] He featured in 66 games the previous campaign for Arsenal, but Wenger rejected the player's need for special treatment: [...] "I looked at the statistics for Tuesday's game and, physically, Patrick was outstanding. He pushed himself very hard and that explains {{why he was so}} tired." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Loser" [...] {{was written}} and {{recorded}} by Beck {{while he was}} visiting Stephenson's home. Although the song was created spontaneously, Beck has claimed {{to have had the}} idea for the song since the late 1980s; he once said, [...] "I don't think I {{would have been able to}} go in and do 'Loser' in a six-hour shot without having been somewhat prepared. It was accidental, <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that I'd been working toward for a long time." [...] Beck played some of his songs for Stephenson; Stephenson enjoyed the songs, but was unimpressed by Beck's rapping. Stephenson recorded a brief guitar part from one of Beck's songs onto an 8-track, looped it, and added a drum track to it. Stephenson then added his own sitar playing and other samples. At that point, Beck began writing and improvising lyrics for the recording. For the song's vocals, Beck attempted to emulate the rapping style of Public Enemy's Chuck D. According to Beck, the line that became the song's chorus originated because [...] "When [...] played it back, I thought, 'Man, I'm the worst rapper in the world, I'm just a loser.' So I started singing 'I'm a [...] baby, so why don't you kill me.'" [...] According to Rothrock, the song was largely finished in six and a half hours, with two minor overdubs several months later.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{previous}} race in Italy, {{the gap between}} Rosberg and Hamilton had closed by seven points. Hamilton had started from pole position ahead of Rosberg, but had a poor start off the line and fell to fourth. He retook the lead after Rosberg braked late and went straight on at the first turn and used the escape road to rejoin the track. Hamilton remained the lead {{for the rest of}} the race to win. With six races left in the season, Hamilton was aware he could not lose any further ground to Rosberg in the championship battle and was pleased to make an improvement after his Monza victory: [...] "Despite the highs and lows, I'm still well and truly in the hunt for the championship and that is something that gives me huge motivation for the final six races - starting in Singapore." [...] Rosberg admitted Hamilton's form and past experience in championship battles could possibly be advantageous <b>but</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> the latter was not concerned over and would focus on himself: [...] "At the moment, I am enjoying the moment more than I ever have in the sport because I get to a race and I have a car where I know I can be on pole and I can win," [...] Ricciardo stated that while he was aware his chances of winning the championship were not realistic, he would take a race-by-race approach, and hoped to win either of the season's next two races to draw closer in the title battle: [...] "All it takes is a couple of wins and a couple of bad races for the championship leader, and all of a sudden everything's possible again. So let's see what happens." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "In good hands," [...] said Clement.

60|$|As {{he spoke}} there reached our ears the first, far-off murmurs of a dreadful music.

5000|$|In 2013, Whedon {{revealed}} that he suffers from workaholism.
