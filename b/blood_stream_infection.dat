50|$|In {{one third}} of cases, {{warfarin}} necrosis occurs in patients with an underlying, innate and previously unknown deficiency of protein C. The condition is related to purpura fulminans, a complication in infants with sepsis (<b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection)</b> which also involves skin necrosis.

There have also been cases in patients with other deficiency, including protein S deficiency, activated protein C resistance (Factor V Leiden) and antithrombin III deficiency.|$|E
5000|$|In {{infectious}} diseases, recrudescence is {{the return}} of detectable symptoms in a patient whose <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> has previously been at such a low level {{as not to be}} clinically demonstrable or cause symptoms. For example, the Plasmodium parasites, which are responsible for malaria, can persist in the blood without causing apparent symptoms for a few months, but recrudescence easily occurs, mainly due to challenges that tax the immune system. This is an example of where the term recrudescence is reserved for a separate meaning from relapse, as relapse in this context occurs due to reactivation of hypnozoites in the liver.|$|E

5000|$|Neonatal sepsis {{is a type}} of {{neonatal}} infection and specifically refers to the presence in a newborn baby of a bacterial <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> (BSI) (such as meningitis, pneumonia, pyelonephritis, or gastroenteritis) in the setting of fever. Older textbooks may refer to neonatal sepsis as [...] "sepsis neonatorum". Criteria with regards to hemodynamic compromise or respiratory failure are not useful clinically because these symptoms often do not arise in neonates until death is imminent and unpreventable. Neonatal sepsis is divided into two categories: early-onset sepsis (EOS) and late-onset sepsis (LOS). EOS refers to sepsis presenting in the first 7 days of life (although some refer to EOS as within the first 72 hours of life), with LOS referring to presentation of sepsis after 7 days (or 72 hours, depending on the system used). neonatal sepsis {{is the single most important}} cause of neonatal death in hospital as well as community in developing country.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Bacterial infections {{complicate the}} course of {{patients}} with human immunodeficiency virus infection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the bacterial pathogens causing <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection,</b> identify the risk factors for the development of <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> and determine the impact of <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> on the outcome of patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus. Methods The incidence, etiology, risk factors and outcome of bacterial <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> were prospectively determined in 1, 225 consecutive hospitalizations of adults with human immunodeficiency virus infection. Results <b>Blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> occurred in 88 hospitalizations (7 %); 73 of 89 infections (82 %) were community acquired. The most commonly isolated gram-positive organism was Streptococcus pneumoniae (21); gram-negative, Escherichia coli (14). <b>Blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> was detected in 8 % of African Americans and 22 % of Hispanics compared with 2 % of whites (P = 0. 0013).

40|$|Aim: Infection is an {{important}} problem in intensive care units (ICU) which is a complication of nutritional support. In our institution, we aimed to determine the differences in infection rates of patients who were supported with parenteral nutrition (PN) and enteral + parenteral nutrition (EN+PN) combination retrospectively. Material and Method: In this study, we enrolled 156 patients from January 1, 2011 to Agust 1, 2011. There were 88 patients in the parenteral nutrition group (Group 1) and 68 patients in the enteral+ parenteral nutrition group (Group 2). On all 156 patients, retrospective chart reviews were performed and biweekly culture results were recorded. Specifically, soft tissue infections, skin <b>infections,</b> catheter related <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infections,</b> pneumonia and urinary tract infections were recorded. HI (hospital infection) incidences and incidence densities were also calculated in both groups. Results: There were 16 recorded infections in 16 patients among Group 1. These were 4 cases of catheter related <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infections,</b> 4 cases of pneumonia, 3 cases of urinary tract infections and 5 cases of soft tissue infections. In group 2, 8 patients showed signs of infection. These were, 4 cases catheter related <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infections,</b> 2 cases of soft tissue infections and 2 cases of urinary tract infections. There were no reported pneumonia cases in group 2. Discussion: According to our results, {{with the exception of}} catheter related <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infections,</b> infection numbers declined within the group of combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition group than parenteral nutrition group alone, but the results were not statistically significant. The intolerance to enteral nutrition can increase the cost of stay, mainly due to increased length of stay as a result of increased infection rates. We would recommend a combination nutrition regimen in such a similar situation, in order to decrease infection rates...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{define the}} {{relative}} incidence of organisms causing <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infections</b> in a tropical setting {{with a very}} low prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus infection (> 1 %). Methods: A 12 -month prospective study of <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infections</b> in 2000 at Royal Darwin Hospital in the tropical north of Australia. Results: Significant isolates were grown from 257 sets of blood cultures. Staphylococcus aureus {{was the most common}} isolate overall (28 %); 26 % of these were methicillin-resistant (MRSA). Escherichia coli was {{the most common cause of}} community-acquired bacteraemia. Burkholderia pseudomallei caused 32 % of community acquired, bacteraemic pneumonia; 6 % of bacteraemias overall. Vancomycin-resistant enterococci were not isolated. Crude mortality rates (13 % overall; 9 % attributable mortality) were lower than in most comparable studies. Conclusions: The major difference between these findings and surveys performed elsewhere is the presence of B. pseudomallei as a significant cause of bacteraemic community-acquired pneumonia. Our results demonstrate the effects of local environmental and patient characteristics on the range of organisms causing <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infections,</b> and emphasize the important role of local microbiology laboratories in guiding empiric antibiotic therap...|$|R

Methods and Results: We reviewed the hemodynamic parameters of 137 adults with septic shock and proven <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> in the ICU. Severe hypotension was defined as a mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) # 65 mmHg. The influence of the duration of severe hypotension on the evolution of acute kidney injury was evaluated according to the RIFLE classification, with day 0 defined as the day of a positive <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection.</b> After bloodstream infection, the probability for a patient to be in Failure was significantly higher than before <b>blood</b> <b>stream</b> <b>infection</b> (OR 51. 94, p 50. 0276).
