Ten individuals of the Andronovo horizon in southern Siberia from 1400 BC to 1000 BC were surveyed.

In several cases, laws restricting {{the use of}} the term kosher have later <b>been</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> be illegal religious interference.|$|E

By the time he died in 1180, 37 {{years had passed since}} that momentous day in 1143 when, amid the wilds of Cilicia, his father had proclaimed him emperor. These years had seen Manuel involved in conflict with his neighbours on all sides. Manuel's father and grandfather before him had worked patiently to undo the damage done by the battle of Manzikert and its aftermath. Thanks to their efforts, the empire Manuel inherited was stronger and better organised than at any time for a century. While it is clear that Manuel used these assets to the full, it is not so clear how much he added to them, and there is room for doubt as to whether he used them to best effect.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium is a hard, silvery, ductile, {{radioactive}} actinide metal. In {{the periodic}} table, {{it is located}} {{to the right of}} the actinide uranium, to the left of the actinide plutonium and below the lanthanide promethium. Neptunium is a hard metal, having a bulk modulus of 118GPa, comparable to that of manganese. Neptunium metal is similar to uranium in terms of physical workability. When exposed to air at normal temperatures, it forms a thin oxide layer. This reaction proceeds more rapidly as the temperature increases. Neptunium has <b>been</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> melt at 639±3°C: this low melting point, a property the metal shares with the neighboring element plutonium (which has melting point 639.4°C), is due to the hybridization of the 5f and 6d orbitals and the formation of directional bonds in the metal. The boiling point of neptunium is not empirically known and the usually given value of 4174°C is extrapolated from the vapor pressure of the element. If accurate, this would give neptunium the largest liquid range of any element (3535K passes between its melting and boiling points).|$|E
5|$|Representations of lions {{date back}} to the early Upper Paleolithic. The lioness-headed ivory carving from Vogelherd cave in the Swabian Alb in southwestern Germany, dubbed Löwenmensch (lion-human) in German. The {{sculpture}} has <b>been</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> be at least 32,000years old from the Aurignacian culture, but it may date to as early as 40,000 years ago. The sculpture has been interpreted as anthropomorphic, giving human characteristics to an animal, however, it also may represent a deity. Two lions were depicted mating in the Chamber of Felines in 15,000-year-old Paleolithic cave paintings in the Lascaux caves. Cave lions also are depicted in the Chauvet Cave, discovered in 1994; this has been dated at 32,000years of age, though it may be of similar or younger age to Lascaux.|$|E

Kinetic study protocols <b>were</b> developed <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the rate constants for the succinic anhydride/aniline model reaction and for the 50 / 50 and 86 / 14 copolymers.

5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate tangentially are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have <b>been</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule, a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial began}} in the High Court of Justice on 30 January 1893, before Sir Henry Hawkins; Bottomley {{conducted}} his own defence. To most observers the case against him seemed impregnable. It was established that, through his nominees, Bottomley had repeatedly bought companies for {{far less than the}} prices approved by the Hansard Union directors, and had pocketed the difference. Bottomley did not deny this, insisting that use of nominees was an accepted commercial practice, and that his actual profits had been much smaller than reported; his expenses, he said, had been enormous. He was helped in his case by the slackness with which the prosecution presented its evidence, and their failure to call key witnesses. He was further helped by the indulgence which Hawkins showed him, and by his own convincing oratory. The essence of his argument was that he was the victim of machinations by the Official Receiver and the Debenture Corporation, who had <b>been</b> <b>determined</b> <b>to</b> win prestige by bringing Bottomley down and wrecking his company. On 26 April, after Hawkins had summed up massively in his favour, Bottomley was acquitted, along with the other defendants.|$|E
