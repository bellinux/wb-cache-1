He participated at the highest badminton club competition level (Eredivisie) for BC Culemborg and BV van Zijderveld. At the moment this badminton player is focusing on his sports management study at the Johan Cruyff University in Amsterdam.Since 2012 the National Association, Surinaamse Badminton Bond is annually organizing a Top 8 Singles event in honor of Virgil Soeroredjo's participation at the 2012 London Olympics. In 2013 Virgil Soeroredjo was planning on attending this event in his home country held by the badminton club of Nieuw Stenov, unfortunately he did not due to his <b>busy</b> <b>study</b> schedule.In November 2013 Virgil attended the National Championships and 7th Suriname International in Paramaribo. In April 2014 he won the 3rd Assuria International Easter Badminton Tournament 2014 at home in Paramaribo beating young Jamaican talent Samuel Ricketts in the final. In November 2014 Virgil attended the National Championships and 8th Suriname International in Paramaribo.|$|E
30|$|For ease {{of online}} survey {{administration}} to a <b>busy</b> <b>study</b> participant population, {{the survey was}} administered using SurveyMonkey® (www.surveymonkey.com, Palo Alto, CA). The final item list and electronic interface were pilot tested as it would appear to all respondents, across an independent group representing a sample of eight potential respondents (four surgeons in academic settings and four in community practices). This aimed to optimize the balance between information gathering and respondent burden in addition to assessing usability and technical functionality of the electronic survey interface (Burns et al. 2008; Eysenbach 2004). Furthermore, the pilot testing aided in refining the questionnaire for any question prompts that could potentially be misinterpreted.|$|E
40|$|Fast graduation, smooth studies, and fluent study {{progress}} are {{the goals}} of today’s university education. How do students themselves perceive their study processes {{and what do they}} think about the factors hindering them from succeeding? The purpose of this research was to find out from the first-year-students of one Finnish university their experiences and opinions. The research investigated what the most difficult issues the students have faced during their first year of university studies have been and what factors have hindered their study progress according to their own perceptions. The students (N= 186) answered to an internet-based open-ended questionnaire. The data were analysed in a qualitative data-based manner which resulted in seven most frequently mentioned hindrances in the questionnaire data. The main hindrances were deficiencies in study skills, difficulties in adjustment to academic studies, unclear directions in studies, difficulties in making study plans and scheduling, lack of guidance in studies and difficulties in finding help, lack of community, and overlapping courses and <b>busy</b> <b>study</b> periods. Based on the findings, it is possible {{to pay attention to the}} difficulties mentioned by students...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{tests the}} hypothesis that being busy increases motivation and reduces {{the time it takes}} to complete tasks for which people miss a deadline. This effect occurs because busy people tend to perceive that they are using their time effectively, which mitigates the sense of failure people have when they miss a task deadline. Studies 1 and 2 show that when people are busy, they are more motivated to complete a task after missing a deadline than those who are not busy, and that the perception that one is using time effectively mediates this effect. Studies 3 and 4 show that this process makes busy people more likely to complete real tasks than people who are not <b>busy.</b> <b>Study</b> 5 uses data from over half a million tasks submitted by thousands of users of a task management software application to show that busy people take less time to complete a task after they miss a deadline for completing it. The findings delineate the conditions under which being busy can mitigate the negative effects of missing a deadline and reduce {{the time it takes to}} complete tasks...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Medical students, {{the future}} doctors, were {{presumed to be}} {{knowledgeable}} about physical activity and would have future influence on their patients. This study aims to describe the pattern of physical activity, predictors of physical inactivity and perceived barriers to and benefits of physical activity among a sample of Egyptian and Saudi medical students. Methods: A cross-sectional comparative study was carried out on 319 Egyptian and 297 Saudi medical students. The long form of the international physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ) {{was used to measure}} physical activity. Data was analyzed according to the guidelines for data processing and analysis of the IPAQ. Perceived barriers to and potential benefits of physical activity were reported. Results: Physical inactivity was significantly higher among Saudi than Egyptian medical students (41. 1 % versus 15. 4 %, respectively). Logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent predictors of physical inactivity were non-membership in sports clubs (OR = 4. 6) and use of private cars for transportation (OR= 3. 9). The most frequent barriers to physical activity are time limitation due to <b>busy</b> <b>study</b> schedule and lack of accessible and suitable sporting places. More than 70 % of students perceived that physical activity promotes and maintains health. Conclusions: Because time and access are key barriers to medical student exercise, we believe that provision of free playgrounds in the college to practice sports during free times will promote physical activity in students.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our {{objective}} was to identify characteristics of infants and their families who were enrolled, refused to enroll, or were excluded from The Environmental Determinants of Diabetes in the Young (TEDDY) study. METHOD: 16, 435 infants screened at birth and identified as at increased genetic risk for type 1 diabetes (T 1 DM) were placed into one of three categories: enrolled, excluded, or refused to enroll. Enrollment, exclusion and refusal rates were compared across countries and between infants {{from the general population}} (GP) and infants with a first degree T 1 DM relative (FDR). A multivariate logistic model was used to identify factors associated with TEDDY enrollment. RESULTS: TEDDY enrollment, exclusion, and refusal rates differed by country and by GP/FDR status but reasons for refusal to enroll were similar across countries and GP/FDR populations. Sweden had the highest enrollment rate, US had the highest exclusion rate, and Finland had the highest refusal rate. FDR infants were more likely to enroll than GP infants. Inability to re-contact the family was the most common reason for exclusion. Primary reasons for refusal to enroll included protocol factors (e. g. blood draws) or family factors (e. g., too <b>busy).</b> <b>Study</b> enrollment was associated with FDR status, European country of origin, older maternal age, a singleton birth, and having another child in TEDDY. CONCLUSIONS: Findings highlight the importance of country specific estimates for enrollment targets in longitudinal pediatric studies and suggest that enrollment estimates should be lowered when the study involves the general population, painful procedures, or makes multiple demands on families...|$|E

5000|$|Ola Raknes {{was always}} searching for {{improvements}} of the therapeutic technique, {{and he was}} also dissatisfied with the traditional psychoanalytical explanatory models for man's basic drives, instincts, and aggression, and he was skeptical of the psychological dualism of Freud's theories of these contradictory basic drives, which at first moved between the instinct for self preservation and sexuality, and later between the life instinct (Eros) and the death instinct (Thanatos). It was during his stay in Berlin that Ola Raknes heard Wilhelm Reich's name for the first time, but there would still be some years before he read anything by Reich.

Ola Raknes found it all to be most interesting and rich in perspective, however, this did not cause him to change either his basic attitudes or his psychotherapeutical technique.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MEd) [...] PU vir CHO, 1991 By {{means of}} a {{literature}} study {{it was determined that}} the role of the principal has changed dramatically over the last few years, from head teacher in the past to manager of a complex organisation. The most important management tasks of the principal were enlightened and it was concluded that principals preferably should possess management experience and management qualifications to cope with their task. It was stated that principals must never stagnate but that they should develop themselves at professional level. To cope with the changes they should regularly attend in-service training courses on educational management. Self-development by principals should eventually lead to the acquiring of a post degree in educational management. From the empirical investigation undertaken, it was determined that the majority of secondary school principals in Lebowa are not in the possession of management qualifications. Most of the principals are, however, academically well-qualified and are <b>busy</b> <b>studying.</b> Finally the assumption was made that the task of the principal in Lebowa must be very difficult due to numerous problems such as lack of infrastructure in schools and the turmoil in which the activists have plunged the entire educational system.
