5000|$|Bioturbation {{is defined}} as the {{disturbance}} and mixing of sediments by benthic organisms. Many aquatic organisms live on or in the bottom sediments and can greatly increase the “migration of sediment contaminants through the direct movement of sediment particles, increasing the surface area of sediments exposed to the water column, and as a food for epibenthic or pelagic organism grazing on the benthos." [...] The depth of bioturbation in marine environments is greater than that in fresh water environments. To prevent and reduce the impact of bioturbation on the cap, the cap should be designed with a sacrificial layer, typically only a few centimeters thick (5-10 cm). This layer will be assumed to be completely mixed with the environment and should prevent <b>benthic</b> <b>organism</b> from descending further into the in-situ cap. The thickness of the sacrificial layer should be based on a study of the local organisms and their behavior in the surrounding sediment near the area of the cap construction, since some benthic organisms have been known to burrow at depths of 1m or more. The presence of armor stone has been known to limit the colonization by deep burrowing benthic creatures. Another method of preventing benthic organisms from destroying the integrity of the cap design is to pick a granular media that the local <b>benthic</b> <b>organism</b> find unattractive and are not known to readily colonize on that surface, thus limiting the chance a <b>benthic</b> <b>organism</b> will grown on the cap.|$|E

5000|$|Following {{deposition}} of the calcarenites, a river delta began to prograde from the Ouachita Uplift {{to the northern}} East Texas Basin. [...] Although the sandstones and siltstones from this delta, known as the Templeton Member, were originally placed within the Woodbine Formation, the ammonites found within them indicate that they are better associated with the Eagle Ford. [...] In areas unaffected by the Templeton Delta, depositional rates were low, producing a condensed section composed of organic-rich, calcareous marls, limestones, and volcanic ash beds in both South Texas and West Texas. The microfossils found within the marls are predominantly coccoliths and planktonic foraminifera, whereas the limestones contain abundant radiolaria and calcispheres (calcareous cysts produced by some dinoflagellates). Inoceramus fragments and fish bones are also found in these deposits. During the Late Cenomanian the Sabine Uplift along the modern-day Texas/Louisiana border became active, causing erosion of Eagle Ford and Woodbine sediments and deposition within the Harris Delta complex. [...] Clay from this delta reached {{as far south as}} DeWitt County, Texas. Towards the end of the Late Cenomanian, the bottom waters of the Texas shelf and the Western Interior Seaway became oxygenated, which {{may be related to the}} sea-level maximum associated with the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event. [...] Evidence for this oxygenation event, known as the “Benthonic Zone,” include an increase in the abundance of <b>benthic</b> <b>organism</b> fossils and bioturbation, a decrease in redox proxies uranium, molybdenum, and vanadium, and a reduction in organic matter. [...] This oxygenation event marks the boundary between the Lower and Upper Eagle Ford in West Texas and the subsurface of South Texas. In general, Upper Eagle Ford rocks deposited during the Cenomanian-Turonian boundary event (OAE2) contain much less organic matter than Lower Eagle Ford rocks, which is the reverse of organic matter trends seen in the global ocean. [...] An unconformity occurs throughout East Texas at this level, possibly due to a lack of sediments reaching the basin during the sea-level maximum.|$|E

50|$|Equilibrium {{partitioning}} Sediment Benchmarks (ESBs) are {{a type of}} Sediment Quality Guideline (SQG) {{derived by}} the USEPA {{for the protection of}} <b>benthic</b> <b>organisms.</b> ESBs are based on the bioavailable concentration of contaminants in sediments rather than the dry-weight concentration. It has been demonstrated that sediment concentrations on a dry-weight basis often do not predict biological effects. Interstitial water concentrations, however, predict biological effects much better. This is true because the chemical present in the interstitial water (or pore water) is the uncomplexed/free phase of the chemical that is bioavailable and toxic to <b>benthic</b> <b>organisms.</b> Other phases of the chemical are bound to sediment particles like organic carbon (OC) or acid volatile sulfides (AVS) and are not bioavailable. Thus the interstitial water concentration is important to consider for effects to <b>benthic</b> <b>organisms.</b>|$|R
40|$|Whirling {{disease is}} the common name for an {{infection}} in salmonids caused by the protozoan, Myxobolus cerebralis. Diseased fish usually show signs of circular swimming, hence the disease name “whirling. ” In addition, diseased fish may show other signs, such as black tail, skeletal deformities, and shortened gill cover. Because of the erratic, uncontrolled circular swimming, the fish are unable to eat or escape predators. Myxobolus cerebralis has a two-host life cycle, alternating between salmonid fish species and a <b>benthic</b> <b>organism,</b> the worm, Tubifex tubifex. The worms live in the mud of streams.

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{reports on}} a {{methodology}} developed {{for the analysis of}} near-bottom photographs collected for fisheries habitat studies. These tools provide a framework for conducting minimally invasive in-situ investigations of <b>benthic</b> <b>organism</b> abundance, diversity, and distribution using high-resolution optical datasets integrated with high precision navigational data. Utilizing these techniques with near-bottom photos collected with a precision navigated survey platform greatly increases the efficiency of image analysis and provides new insight about the relationships between benthic organisms and the habitats in which they are found. Basic requirements for the analysis of near-bottom seafloor images include camera calibration and quantification of the height of the lens above the seafloor throughout the survey. Corrections are required to compensate for image distortion due to lighting limitations and the variable micro-topography of the seafloor. These parameters can be constrained by utilizing precisely navigated survey platforms such as Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) or Remote Operated Vehicles (ROVs). The methodology we present was developed with data collected by the SeaBED AUV off the coast of Washington, Oregon and California [1]. A digital database containing <b>benthic</b> <b>organism</b> identifications, measurements, and locations was generated for each image using a Graphical User Interface (GUI) created in Matlab ™ [1, 2]. This methodology has demonstrated {{a significant increase in the}} efficiency of image analysis for benthic habitat studies, and provides the opportunity to assess small scale spatial distribution of organisms in their natural habitats.

40|$|Abstract. The {{cyanobacterium}} Rivularia {{is often}} the dominant genus in unpolluted stretches of many calcareous streams. Previous studies have detected microcystins in field-collected colonies from Mediterranean streams in Spain. Because sheaths andmucilage represent {{a substantial part of}} the colonies, the localisation ofmicrocystins withinRivularia colonies was tested with immunological methods to elucidate the role of mucilage in toxicity. Microcystins were localised inside the trichomes, in the filament sheaths and in the colonial mucilage. The presence of microcystins was also shown in some heterocysts, but nomircocystins were detected in multicellular hairs. We suggest that microcystins are important for a <b>benthic</b> <b>organism</b> growing slowly for much of the time, that some labour division may exists between the cells in the colony and that these immunological methods may be a useful alternative for microcystin detection...|$|E
