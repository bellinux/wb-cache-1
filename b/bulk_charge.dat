50|$|Stage 1 {{is called}} the I-phase, constant-current stage, or <b>bulk</b> <b>charge</b> stage. This phase occurs when an IUoU charger is {{connected}} to a deeply discharged battery. The charger provides a constant current, typically the maximum current that the charger is capable of producing. As {{a result of the}} current, the battery absorbs the charge and its voltage rises. The charger limits the maximum voltage to Umax, a constant or temperature-dependent maximum, typically around 2.4 V per cell. Once the Umax voltage is reached, typically when the battery is charged to 70-80% of its capacity, the charger enters the Uo-phase. In case of a battery that is more than 80% full, this may happen immediately once the charger is switched on. Some chargers may keep the voltage at Umax for some time and allow the current to drop to 80% of the constant-current value, before proceeding to the next stage.|$|E

5000|$|The {{underlying}} {{fault with}} all {{lead acid batteries}} is the requirement for an excessively long charge time arising from a two-stage process: <b>bulk</b> <b>charge</b> and float charge. All lead acid batteries, irrespective of type, are quick to charge to 70% of capacity within 2 or 3 hours, but require another 9 to 10 hours to [...] "float charge" [...] after the initial charge. If users fail to float charge, battery capacity is dramatically reduced. All types of batteries have a [...] "memory" [...] in that every time a user charges to less than 100% charge, battery capacity is shortened. A lead acid battery could reach 4,600 cycles if it were kept on a shelf and kept at the right state of charge. To ensure a life of 8 years, a lead acid battery should be kept at full charge when stored (or dry), and, when working, kept at depth of discharge of less than 20%. In addition, its discharge rate should be not {{more than three hours}} and its charge rate should be not more than three hours (C0.333), and it should be float charged properly.

40|$|An {{advanced}} charger {{has been}} proposed for a battery that comprises several lithium-ion cells in series. The proposal is directed toward charging the cells in as nearly an optimum manner as possible despite unit-to-unit differences among the nominally identical cells. The particular aspect of the charging problem that motivated the proposal can be summarized as follows: During <b>bulk</b> <b>charging</b> (charging all the cells in series at the same current), the voltages of individual cells increase at different rates. Once one of the cells reaches full <b>charge,</b> <b>bulk</b> <b>charging</b> must be stopped, leaving other cells less than fully charged. To {{make it possible to}} bring all cells up to full <b>charge</b> once <b>bulk</b> <b>charging</b> has been completed, the proposed charger would include a number of top-off chargers one for each cell. The top-off chargers would all be powered from the same DC source, but their outputs would be DC-isolated from each other and AC-coupled to their respective cells by means of transformers, as described below. Each top-off charger would include a flyback transformer, an electronic switch, and an output diode. For suppression of undesired electromagnetic emissions, each top-off charger would also include (1) a resistor and capacitor configured to act as a snubber and (2) an inductor and capacitor configured as a filter. The magnetic characteristics of the flyback transformer and the duration of its output pulses determine the energy delivered to the lithium-ion cell. It would be necessary to equip the cell with a precise voltage monitor to determine when the cell reaches full charge. In response to a full-charge reading by this voltage monitor, the electronic switch would be held in the off state. Other cells would continue to be charged similarly by their top-off chargers until their voltage monitors read full charge...|$|R

Noether’s general {{analysis}} of conservation laws {{has to be}} completed in a Lagrangian theory with local gauge invariance. <b>Bulk</b> <b>charges</b> are replaced by fluxes at a suitable singularity (in general at infinity) of so-called superpotentials, namely local functions of the gauge fields (or more generally of the gauge forms).

We shall study mostly local consequences of gauge invariance. Quite generally there exist local superpotentials analogous to those of Freud or Bergmann for General Relativity. They are parametrized by infinitesimal gauge transformations but are afflicted by topological ambiguities which one must handle case by case. The choice of variational principle: variables, surface terms and boundary conditions is crucial. As a first illustration we propose a new Affine action that reduces to General Relativity upon gauge fixing the dilatation (Weyl 1918 like) part of the connection and elimination of auxiliary fields.

In the current paper, we reconsider the validity of such models by appealing to the so-called ``causal entropy bound''. In this framework, a paradoxical outcome is obtained: these brane worlds are indeed holographically viable, provided that the <b>bulk</b> <b>charge</b> is not too small.

For anatase the activity increases for films up to ~ 5  nm thick, while rutile films reach their maximum activity for ~ 2. 5  nm films already. This shows that charge carriers excited deeper in the bulk contribute to surface reactions in anatase than in rutile.

In response to this need, we have developed, under our IRAD Program, a set of engineering tools that operate on personal computers and addresses both the surface and <b>bulk</b> <b>charging</b> aspects of the interactions. These engineering codes utilize circuit analysis techniques and model simplifications to allow rapid computations.

The agreement for the predicted differential surface voltages for the model is given. In conducting the comparison of engineering codes to NASCAP predictions, it was found that some inconsistencies existed in the NASCAP code that are not obvious to the user. The use of the grid imposes constraints that voltage gradients exist between the grid points.
