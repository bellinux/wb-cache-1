5|$|Before {{developing}} True Detective, Nic Pizzolatto {{worked as}} a literature professor for the University of Chicago, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and DePauw University. He also delved into fiction writing, having developed a fascination for it {{as a graduate student}} at the University of Arkansas. His first published work was the short story collection Between Here and the Yellow Sea, released in 2006. The author published his debut novel, titled Galveston, four years later, and around the same time began preparing to <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> into the television industry (earlier attempts were never realized due to lack of capital).|$|E
5|$|Field {{released}} his debut album, Sub-Conscious, in 2006. It featured orchestral {{music from the}} Northwest Sinfonia. He created the album {{as a way to}} <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> from theatrical trailer composition into work as a solo artist. Field utilizes Logic Pro and MIDI for his musical composition; after this process he delivers these files along with an MP3 to the individual in charge of orchestration, who uses Finale software to convert this to musical notation. The album was made available on iTunes, CD Baby, Amazon.com, and for retail sale].|$|E
5|$|In 1992, {{several months}} {{after the release of}} Net-2, William Jolitz and Lynne Jolitz wrote {{replacements}} for those six missing files, ported BSD to the Intel 80386-based microprocessors, and called their new operating system 386BSD. They released 386BSD via an anonymous FTP server. The development flow of 386BSD was slow and after a period of neglect, a group of 386BSD users decided to <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> on their own and create FreeBSD so that they could keep the operating system up to date. The first version of FreeBSD was released on November 1993.|$|E

5|$|Through {{connections}} that Cohen had with record producer Samuel Charters, the group signed a recording contract with Vanguard Records in December 1966, {{just as the}} label, which had primarily released folk music, was attempting to <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> into the growing psychedelic rock scene. While the band waited to record their debut album, they were present at the Human Be-In, along with other influential San Francisco musical acts, including Jefferson Airplane, Big Brother and the Holding Company, and Quicksilver Messenger Service. The event was a prelude to the Summer of Love and helped publicize counterculture ideals such as ecology, free-love {{and the use of}} illicit drugs.|$|E
5|$|As Thompson began porting {{the game}} to the new system, {{he decided not to}} base the code on any of the {{existing}} software for the computer, and instead write his own. As a result, he implemented his own base code libraries for programs to use, including arithmetic packages and graphics subsystems. These initial subsystems were coded in assembly language on the GECOS system and assembled, then the output physically put on punched tapes to be carried over and inserted into the PDP-7. Thompson then wrote an assembler for the PDP-7 to avoid this laborious process. The game ran very slowly on the new machine, causing Thompson to <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> from there to design his own file system based on some ideas by Dennis Ritchie and Rudd Canaday, rooted in their experience with the Multics file system, with which he then ran Space Travel.|$|E

5|$|Etty's Cleopatra's Arrival in Cilicia, {{painted in}} 1821, {{featured}} numerous nudes and was exhibited to great acclaim. Its success prompted several further depictions of historical scenes with nudes. All {{but one of}} the works he exhibited at the Royal Academy in the 1820s contained at least one nude figure, and he acquired a reputation for indecency. Despite this, he was commercially successful and critically acclaimed, and in 1828 was elected a Royal Academician, at the time the highest honour available to an artist. Although {{he was one of the}} most respected artists in the country he continued to study at life classes throughout his life, a practice considered inappropriate by his fellow artists. In the 1830s Etty began to <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> into the more lucrative but less respected field of portraiture, and later became the first English painter to paint significant still lifes. He continued to paint both male and female nudes, which caused severe criticism and condemnation from some elements of the press.|$|E

Honey, a Taiwanese drama series, and Colour Blossoms, an erotic drama by Hong Kong filmmaker Yonfan. On May 19, 2007, Harisu married Micky Jung, however the couple divorced in 2017.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Pentecostal Holiness Church {{began to}} <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> beyond the United States by affiliating with sister Pentecostal bodies {{in other parts}} of the world. In 1967, an {{affiliation}} was formed with the Pentecostal Methodist Church of Chile, one of the largest national Pentecostal churches in the world and the largest non-Catholic church in Chile. At the time, the Jotabeche Pentecostal Methodist congregation was the largest church in the world with over 60,000 members. With over 150,000 members, it ranks second to the Yoido Full Gospel Church in Seoul, South Korea. This denomination claims 1.7 million adherents. A similar affiliation was forged in 1985 with the Wesleyan Methodist Church of Brazil. A Neo-Pentecostal body with roots in the Brazilian Methodist Church, the Wesleyan Church numbered some 50,000 members and adherents in 1995. The word International was added to the church's name in 1975.|$|E

5|$|Taiko {{emerged in}} the United States in the late 1960s. The first group, San Francisco Taiko Dojo, was formed in 1968 by Seiichi Tanaka, a postwar {{immigrant}} who studied taiko in Japan and brought the styles and teachings to the US. A year later, {{a few members of}} Senshin Buddhist Temple in Los Angeles led by its minister Masao Kodani initiated another group called Kinnara Taiko. San Jose Taiko later formed in 1973 in Japantown, San Jose, under Roy and PJ Hirabayashi. Taiko started to <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> to the eastern US in the late 1970s. This included formation of Denver Taiko in 1976 and Soh Daiko in New York City in 1979. Many of these early groups lacked the resources to equip each member with a drum and resorted to makeshift percussion materials such as rubber tires or creating taiko out of wine barrels.|$|E
5|$|The RS-25 engine {{consists}} of various pumps, valves, and other components which work in concert to produce thrust. Fuel (liquid hydrogen) and oxidizer (liquid oxygen) from the Space Shuttle's external tank entered the orbiter at the umbilical disconnect valves {{and from there}} flowed through the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS) feed lines; whereas in the Space Launch System (SLS), fuel and oxidizer from the rocket's core stage will flow directly into the MPS lines. Once in the MPS lines, the fuel and oxidizer each <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> into separate paths to each engine (three on the Space Shuttle, four on the SLS). In each branch, prevalves then allow the propellants to enter the engine.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} a tree serve to anchor {{it to the ground}} and gather water and {{nutrients}} to transfer to all parts of the tree. They are also used for reproduction, defence, survival, energy storage and many other purposes. The radicle or embryonic root is the first part of a seedling to emerge from the seed during the process of germination. This develops into a taproot which goes straight downwards. Within a few weeks lateral roots <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> of the side of this and grow horizontally through the upper layers of the soil. In most trees, the taproot eventually withers away and the wide-spreading laterals remain. Near the tip of the finer roots are single cell root hairs. These are in immediate contact with the soil particles and can absorb water and nutrients such as potassium in solution. The roots require oxygen to respire and only a few species such as the mangrove and the pond cypress (Taxodium ascendens) can live in permanently waterlogged soil.|$|E

5|$|The {{streets in}} {{downtown}} Ann Arbor conform to a grid pattern, though {{this pattern is}} less common in the surrounding areas. Major roads <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> from the downtown district like spokes on a wheel to the highways surrounding the city. The city is belted by three freeways: I-94, which runs along the southern and western portion of the city; U.S. Highway 23 (US23), which primarily runs along {{the eastern edge of}} Ann Arbor; and M-14, which runs along the northern edge of the city. Other nearby highways include US12 (Michigan Ave.), M-17 (Washtenaw Ave.), and M-153 (Ford Rd.). Several of the major surface arteries lead to the I-94/M-14 interchange in the west, US 23 in the east, and the city's southern areas. The city also has a system of bike routes and paths and includes the nearly complete Washtenaw County Border-to-Border Trail.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man X was {{developed}} by a team at Capcom which had worked on the long-running Mega Man series for the NES. Lead artist Keiji Inafune (credited as a planner as Inemuryar) recounted {{that the development of}} Mega Man X required a lot of brainstorming for its storyline and content where the team's goal was to <b>branch</b> <b>out</b> from original Mega Man games while still maintaining their fundamentals. In the original Mega Man series, Inafune typically designed the protagonist while his protégé Hayato Kaji handled the supporting characters. However, their roles were reversed for Mega Man X. Kaji (credited as Rippa H.K) illustrated the protagonist X, but had a difficult time with the initial design. He was presented with much more freedom than he was accustomed with the SNES's larger palette of colors when compared to the NES. Inafune and Kaji worked simultaneously on the various designs for X with different pieces of armor attached. The idea for the armor parts came about because the game was planned during a time when role-playing video games were becoming extremely popular. Inafune felt that Mega Man had always represented a classic action game formula in which the hero earns his defeated enemies' abilities; the armor parts were added to supplement this concept.|$|E
