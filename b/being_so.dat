5|$|An {{elite and}} well trained force of bodyguards known as Garudas {{protected}} {{the members of}} the royal family at all times. These servants moved closely yet inconspicuously by the side of their master, their loyalty <b>being</b> <b>so</b> complete that they committed suicide after his death. Hero stones (virgal) erected in memory of these bodyguards are called Garuda pillars. The Garuda pillar at the Hoysaleswara temple in Halebidu was erected in honor of Kuvara Lakshma, a minister and bodyguard of King Veera Ballala II.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{halfway through}} the third day, only Shogo, Shuya, Noriko, and Kiriyama remain, with Kiriyama dead set on hunting down the trio. After a frantic car chase, Kiriyama is finally gunned down - but Nanahara and Nakagawa are held at gunpoint by Shogo, who taunts them over <b>being</b> <b>so</b> naive as to trust anyone in the Program. The collars record gunshots and Shuya and Noriko flatlining.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his music career, Keenan has ventured into fields such as acting, improvisational sketch comedy, and winemaking. He currently owns Merkin Vineyards and the associated winery Caduceus Cellars. Since rising to fame, he has been noted as <b>being</b> <b>so</b> private {{that he has been}} referred to as a recluse; however, he does emerge for the occasional interview and to support charitable causes.|$|E

A postal inspector also admitted to the show that since it had successfully put most child-porn producers out of business, it was now going after consumers with material of its own.|$|E
5|$|On his {{northern}} frontier Manuel expended considerable {{effort to}} preserve the conquests made by Basil II over one hundred years earlier and maintained, sometimes tenuously, ever since. Due to distraction from his neighbours on the Balkan frontier, Manuel was kept from his main objective, the subjugation of the Normans of Sicily. Relations had been good with the Serbs and Hungarians since 1129, so the Serb rebellion came as a shock. The Serbs of Rascia, <b>being</b> <b>so</b> induced by Roger II of Sicily, invaded Byzantine territory in 1149.|$|E
5|$|The Picidae {{are just}} one of eight living {{families}} in the order Piciformes, the others being barbets, toucans, and honeyguides in the clade Pici, and the jacamars and puffbirds in the clade Galbuli. DNA sequencing has confirmed the sister relationships of these two groups. The family Picidae includes about 240 species arranged in 35 genera. Almost 20 species are threatened with extinction due to loss of habitat or habitat fragmentation, with one, the Bermuda flicker, being extinct and a further two probably <b>being</b> <b>so.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} {{underwent a}} series of repairs and redecoration, {{carried out by the}} Steel Coleman Davis Partnership in the early 21st century. These included a significant structural repair, as the main supporting roof truss was badly damaged. The frontage was also upgraded to withstand the weathering effects of being north-facing, and the damage caused by <b>being</b> <b>so</b> close to the road. Services continue to be held at the Unitarian Chapel, and as of March 2015, are held twice a month, on the first and third Sundays of each month.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{terms for}} classifying individuals of low intelligence were medical or legal terms {{that preceded the}} development of IQ testing. The legal system recognized a concept of some individuals <b>being</b> <b>so</b> cognitively impaired {{that they were not}} responsible for criminal behavior. Medical doctors sometimes encountered adult patients who could not live independently, being unable {{to take care of their}} own daily living needs. Various terms were used to attempt to classify individuals with varying degrees of intellectual disability. Many of the earliest terms are now considered very offensive.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the lack}} of {{easy access to the}} ranch and any lodging in the area, {{tourists}} flocked to this site. The 1887 completion of the Southern Pacific line increased the number of visitors, as the railroad featured the ranch in its advertisements in order to distinguish the line from its competitors. Although the ranch was not developed for tourism, the Del Valles, with their Californio sense of hospitality, would lodge the visitors. By October 1888, housing visitors was getting to be so expensive for the family that Reginaldo del Valle pressed his mother to stop <b>being</b> <b>so</b> hospitable. The tourists could be quite a nuisance, and unscrupulous visitors would steal items from the house as souvenirs, or help themselves to fruit from the orchards.|$|E

5|$|During the {{transition}} period {{he worked as a}} pathology registrar at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research and also prepared for his Doctor of Medicine examinations, late in 1923. In 1923 he took up the post of senior resident pathologist at the Melbourne Hospital; the laboratories were a part of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute. He conducted research into the agglutinin reactions in typhoid fever, leading to his first scientific publications. He decided to work full-time on the antibody response in typhoid, even though he was technically supposed to pursuing pathology as part of his obligations to the hospital. Burnet came first in the Doctor of Medicine exams by a long distance, and his score was excluded from the scaling process so that the other students would not fail for <b>being</b> <b>so</b> far behind.|$|E
5|$|HeliumI has a {{gas-like}} {{index of}} refraction of 1.026 which makes its surface so hard to see that floats of Styrofoam are often used to show where the surface is. This colorless liquid has a very low viscosity and a density of 0.145–0.125 g/mL (between about 0 and 4 K), which is only one-fourth the value expected from classical physics. Quantum mechanics is needed to explain this property and thus both states of liquid helium (helium I and helium II) are called quantum fluids, meaning they display atomic properties on a macroscopic scale. This may be an effect of its boiling point <b>being</b> <b>so</b> close to absolute zero, preventing random molecular motion (thermal energy) from masking the atomic properties.|$|E
5|$|In retrospect, {{being sent}} {{far from the}} Middle East (Egypt) he viewed as a parental {{decision}} much influenced by “the prospects of deracinated people, like us the Palestinians, <b>being</b> <b>so</b> uncertain {{that it would be}} best to send me as far away as possible.” The realities of peripatetic life—of interwoven cultures, of feeling out of place, and of homesickness—so affected the schoolboy Edward that themes of dissonance feature in the work and worldview of the academic Said. At school’s end, he had become Edward W. Said—a polyglot intellectual (fluent in English, French, and Arabic) who had earned a Bachelor of Arts (1957) degree at Princeton University, and Master of Arts (1960) and Doctor of Philosophy (1964) degrees in English Literature from Harvard University.|$|E

5|$|Its {{high density}} and {{resistance}} to corrosion have been exploited {{in a number of}} related applications. It is used as ballast in sailboat keels. Its weight allows it to counterbalance the heeling effect of wind on the sails; <b>being</b> <b>so</b> dense it takes up a small volume and minimizes water resistance. It is used in scuba diving weight belts to counteract the diver's buoyancy. In 1993, the base of the Leaning Tower of Pisa was stabilized with 600 tonnes of lead. Because of its corrosion resistance, lead is used as a protective sheath for underwater cables.|$|E
5|$|Joshua Humphreys' {{design was}} {{unusual for the}} time, being long on keel and narrow of beam (width) and {{mounting}} very heavy guns. The design called for a diagonal scantling (rib) scheme intended to restrict hogging while giving the ships extremely heavy planking. This design gave the hull a greater strength than a more lightly built frigate. Humphreys' design was based on his realization that the fledgling United States of the period could not match the European states {{in the size of}} their navies. This <b>being</b> <b>so,</b> the frigates were designed to overpower other frigates with the ability to escape from a ship of the line.|$|E
5|$|Originally, MTV {{planned to}} air the show {{several times during}} April 1992, it was normal for MTV Unplugged {{sessions}} to air around six times {{during the month of}} release, before being archived. Carey's version was met with critical acclaim and extended popularity, leading to it being shown more often than usual. Fans from around the United States made multiple requests for the show to be aired on television, {{and by the end of}} April 1992, Carey's episode of MTV Unplugged had aired over three-times as much as an average episode would. The concert's success tempted Sony officials to use it as some form of an album. However, Carey and Afansieff were already making headway on a new album set tentatively for release in 1993. This <b>being</b> <b>so,</b> Sony decided to release it as an EP, selling for a reduced price due to its shorter length.|$|E

5|$|Prevented from {{cutting the}} French line ahead of Achille, HMS Brunswick turned {{and tried to}} cross aft of her, between Achille and Vengeur. Seeing the manoeuvre, Renaudin also {{accelerated}} to close this new gap, and Brunswick and Vengeur collided, the anchor of Brunswick becoming entangled in the rigging of Vengeur. Vengeur fired an entire broadside at point-blank range, but was then unable to fire her main batteries again, the ships <b>being</b> <b>so</b> close as to prevent French gunners from ramming ammunition into their guns; in contrast, British gunners used rammers with semi-rigid rope handles instead of wooden handles, {{and were able to}} reload and maintain a sustained fire, riddling Vengeur with holes. The fight went on for four hours, until Brunswick, after shattering the rudder of Vengeur to prevent her from manoeuvring, separated at 12:45. Her fire also opened a large hole in the hull of Vengeur.|$|E
5|$|The name durian {{comes from}} the Malay word duri (thorn) {{together}} with the suffix -an (for building a noun in Malay). D. zibethinus is the only species commercially cultivated {{on a large scale}} and available outside of its native region. Since this species is open-pollinated, it shows considerable diversity in fruit colour and odour, size of flesh and seed, and tree phenology. In the species name, zibethinus refers to the Indian civet, Viverra zibetha. There is disagreement regarding whether this name, bestowed by Linnaeus, refers to civets <b>being</b> <b>so</b> fond of the durian that the fruit was used as bait to entrap them, or to the durian smelling like the civet.|$|E
5|$|A log {{portion of}} the {{original}} Oklahoma Row was moved north and now sits {{on the east side}} of Highway 94 in Monte Ne. It is used for storage. The three-story concrete-and-stone tower still stands and remains above water on the edge of Beaver Lake. This section is often incorrectly referred to as the bank building and the honeymoon suite. Monte Ne was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1978 because of the historic significance of <b>being</b> <b>so</b> closely associated with Harvey and its unique architecture and engineering. Despite this, what is left of Monte Ne has fallen victim to severe neglect and vandalism. It is covered with spray paint and graffiti, as well as being cracked and full of debris. In 2011 the fire department was called to help a person who had climbed to the top floor and gotten stuck in the chimney. Because of this incident and the general state of the remains, the Army Corps of Engineers erected a temporary barbed wire fence around the tower.|$|E
