50|$|A small, unusually richly {{decorated}} {{building on}} {{the southern end of}} the site, adjacent to Freshney House is an 1896 morgue designed by Henry Marks. The corrugated iron-clad, truncated hipped roof of the morgue is lined with decorative <b>barge</b> <b>board</b> details. The building is situated at the western end of the site, near to a 1940 morgue. This building is now used as a store.|$|E

50|$|Mignon Faget {{launched}} {{her first}} ready-to-wear line in 1969 {{in a studio}} in the Riverbend neighborhood of New Orleans. She renovated a <b>barge</b> <b>board</b> cottage and it became the early headquarters housing her studio, jewelry workshop and retail gallery for many years. In 1997, she renovated a neo-classical former bank building to house her company, {{in addition to having}} galleries in New Orleans, Metairie, and Baton Rouge. After opening her new facility, she donated her original location on Dublin Street to the Preservation Resource Center.|$|E
5000|$|The {{red flags}} were duly brought out, ruining seven other drivers' runs {{including}} both the McLarens and the leading Jaguar of Eddie Irvine - {{who had his}} <b>barge</b> <b>board</b> knocked off by debris - although for Marques and Minardi it was a godsend. Burti meanwhile hurried back to the pits, but was not allowed back out: [...] "We didn't put Luciano in the spare because we didn't want to overburden him {{and we wanted to}} preserve it for tomorrow," [...] said Bobby Rahal ominously.|$|E
5000|$|Generally the STR2 and RB3 {{received}} aerodynamic revisions {{at different}} stages through the season. The STR2 was fitted with a new front wing in Monaco, {{similar to the one}} that sister team Red Bull implemented in the previous round, with 2 curved upper profiles that improve airflow over the car and increase downforce. The team further developed the STR2 in Turkey with a new <b>barge</b> <b>board</b> development. The STR2 was fitted with a [...] "arch" [...] over the nose on the front wing around the Italian Grand Prix, the Red Bull RB3s did not sport such a wing design until around the Japanese Grand Prix.|$|E
5000|$|According to Alex Francis, his mother, Angela Francis, erected the lychgate for {{her husband}} and the {{elaborate}} <b>barge</b> <b>boards</b> were carved by her friends. A small bronze plaque reads [...] "ERECTED BY ANGELA FRANCIS 1902".|$|R
50|$|There is one listed {{building}} within the village called the Gables. The {{building is a}} pair of cottages thought to have been built around 1840. One of the outstanding features of the cottages are the ornamental fretted gable end <b>barge</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{church is}} {{constructed}} with a timber frame and clad externally with local hardwood chamfered boards and internally with hoop pine boarding. The gabled {{roof of the}} building is clad with corrugated ZINCALUME sheeting. The gable ends are decorated with carved timber <b>barge</b> <b>boards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Like many railway {{stations}} erected {{during this}} period, the Central Vermont's standard design combined function with style. The low hipped roof (a Romanesque feature) {{extends beyond the}} wall surface creating a large over-hang to shelter a waiting platform. Decorative brackets and columns support the roof and round arched windows and doors penetrate the four fa√ßades, typical of the style. The verge or <b>barge</b> <b>board,</b> a wooden ornamental motif along the eaves, was borrowed from the Gothic Revival style, a contemporary of the Romanesque. Many of the original materials used to build the station remain intact, such as the yellow pine interior sheathing, buff pressed brick, and window and door sills of Barre granite. The sounds and vibrations of the train rushing down the tracks completes this preserved early 20th century environment.|$|E
50|$|This {{building}} is located about 40m north {{west of the}} winder and compressor house. Its overall dimensions are approximately 13m by 6.5m. It is a large shed with a wooden frame, gable roof and corrugated iron cladding; the roof line runs east-west. There are door openings at {{the east and west}} elevations and window openings along the long, north and south elevations. All window and door openings are shaded by narrow strips of sheet metal, the windows have wooden sills. Many are covered with sheets of corrugated iron. Some are metal framed sash windows; others have no window frames or glazing. Remnants of wooden boards run along the tops of the north and south elevations. The west elevation has an unpainted wooden <b>barge</b> <b>board.</b> There is no guttering on the roof.|$|E
50|$|The {{main house}} {{comprises}} two chamferboard buildings which have corrugated iron hipped roofs and {{are joined by}} an enclosed verandah breezeway. The older main farmhouse has a projecting gable porch to the southwest and northeast entrances with a decorative timber <b>barge</b> <b>board,</b> truss and finial, and timber shingles are visible under the corrugated iron sheeting. The plan consists of three bedrooms and a drawing room or parlour with a central hall. The side verandahs have been enclosed to expand the rooms through large archways, the northwest being enclosed with very wide cedar chamferboards. Some rooms {{are in the process}} of restoration and show different layers of the building's fabric, including pit sawn framing with mortice and tenon joints and hand-finished lining boards. Decorative features include painted woodgrain in the hall, hand painted wall paper, pressed metal ceilings in the drawing room, carved timber fireplace surrounds, casement windows, some of which have coloured glass inserts, step out bays and pressed metal window hoods.|$|E
5000|$|The Union Station, {{unlike most}} urban {{railroad}} stations, was {{situated in a}} [...] "more spacious area". In the west end was a waiting area, and the east end featured a two-story freight section. The station gains a Gothic look with wooden <b>barge</b> <b>boarding</b> and brackets on its gabled entrance.|$|R
50|$|The {{plantation}} {{house at}} Faunsdale Plantation {{is a simple}} Greek Revival style two-story wood frame structure with a gabled roof, flanked on each side with one-story gabled wings. The nearby slave cabins date from 1860 and are also wood frame structures with high-pitched gables and scalloped <b>barge</b> <b>boards</b> that show a Carpenter Gothic influence.|$|R

50|$|In Futuna Chapel, John Scott {{employed}} a composite language that references {{a number of}} different architectural traditions. The tree-like central timber post can be seen as an interpretation of the centre posts of the traditional Maori meeting house or wharenui. The steeply pitched roof forms also allude to the entry porch of the wharenui, with its prominent sweeping <b>barge</b> <b>boards</b> (maihi).|$|R
50|$|There are two double storey gabled {{projections}} which {{interrupt the}} verandahs {{on the front}} and western elevations, and a single one on the upper floor at the rear. These have bay windows with elaborate awnings and timber valances, and pierced <b>barge</b> <b>boards</b> on the gables. The hipped roof of corrugated iron incorporates the three gables, two chimneys and numerous ventilators.|$|R
50|$|This {{weatherboard}} {{church is}} rectangular in shape {{with a small}} gabled front porch. A bellcote surmounts {{the front of the}} gable roof which is in corrugated iron. The front gable is decorated with scalloped timber <b>barge</b> <b>boards.</b> There are 6 gothic-style leadlight windows along each side of the building and two at the front. They are all memorials to the church's pioneer families.|$|R
50|$|Constructed at {{the same}} time as the main building, and located on the south side also {{addressing}} the river, the office is a two storeyed structure of face brick laid in English bond. It has a double gabled roof of corrugated iron, with decorative <b>barge</b> <b>boards</b> and a chimney at each end of the front gable. The eaves are supported by a series of decorative brackets.|$|R
50|$|St Agnes rectory is a {{single-storeyed}} weatherboard {{building with}} a corrugated iron hipped gable roof. It has timber stumps, with verandahs on {{the north and east}} sides. The street entrance porch has a projecting gable to the verandah with decorative timber truss, finial and <b>barge</b> <b>boards.</b> The verandah roof is at a lesser pitch to the main roof and the hipped gables have curved timber bargeboards.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} was built using reinforced concrete and modeled after Japanese traditional temple of wood structure. The hall features a hip-and-gable roof and <b>barge</b> <b>boards</b> on the gable end, a {{roof of the}} unique style of Japanese Shinto architecture and a western roof truss. Half of the floor is paved with tatami for Judo practice area {{and the other half}} is paved with wooden boards for Kendo practice area.|$|R
50|$|The {{external}} {{shape of}} the two gables, with a long pitched roof level between them, is typical of merchant houses of the late 15thC. The remains of the very richly carved <b>barge</b> <b>boards</b> on the gables also suggest a very expensive and high quality building of the early Tudor period, as does {{the height of the}} archway which horses and riders {{would have been able to}} pass through into the courtyard.|$|R
50|$|The core is {{rectangular}} in form, with an encircling verandah, {{a highly}} pitched gabled-roof (originally shingled but now clad with corrugated iron), attic rooms and a brick basement. Parts of the verandah have been enclosed. Decorative elements include scalloped <b>barge</b> <b>boards,</b> turned finials with twisted lightning conductors, distinctive arched dormer windows, turned cedar verandah balusters and two classically moulded chimney heads. Internally, {{much of the}} original cedar joinery survives.|$|R
25|$|Even {{more curious}} is the {{presence}} of patterns of glazed bricks and various plaques bearing initials and enigmatic symbols. As already mentioned, the porch gable contains glazed headers in a diamond shape (diapering) and a glazed header barge line (a diagonal line of bricks following the <b>barge</b> <b>boards</b> on the gable), but these embellishments are unevenly spaced so that the diamond is clearly off-center (see porch picture in gallery). This irregularity is true for the use of glazed headers throughout the structure.|$|R
5000|$|As {{it stands}} today, Greycliffe is a large, {{elaborate}} and well-preserved neo-Gothic Victorian house which retains unobstructed water views {{across to the}} northern shore of Sydney Harbour. It boasts multiple gables, a long entrance hall, a stately staircase and carved <b>barge</b> <b>boards.</b> Stables adjoin at the rear and the residence's gardens tumble down to the beachfront, while natural bushland frames {{the house to the}} rear. The house's upstairs interior and roof were extensively damaged by fire in 1897 but the structure was restored soon after.|$|R
50|$|A short {{distance}} from these two buildings, {{near the site of}} the original Bleak Hall house, is another tabby building, thought to have been used as a barn during the Colonial period and subsequently used as an equipment shed. The building's high gable roof, oriented north-south, is clad in cypress shingles. A wooden spire topped with a pendant rises from each gable end. <b>Barge</b> <b>boards</b> decorated with dentils cover the gable eaves; boards decorated with serrations run below the east and west eaves. There are doors on the north and south sides.|$|R
