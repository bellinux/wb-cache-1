In <b>batching,</b> where crude <b>oil</b> <b>batches</b> with different qualities and properties are transported by the same pipeline, a blended zone is created at the interface of the <b>oil</b> <b>batches.</b> The volume of the blended zone grows with time. It is important to estimate the extent of the mixing and the size of the blended zone to predict the volume of high-quality light crude that will be contaminated with the lower-quality heavy crude during transportation. Ultimately, in this process, the operational question is where to cut the batches. To answer this question, we have to understand the different scenarios which can be observed during batching. One possible scenario is a case where both heavy oil (HO) and light oil (LO) flows are turbulent. In cases where a turbulent-turbulent configuration exists, a fairly well defined blended zone is created between batches for which, with a good accuracy, it is possible to say that if the mixed zone is cut in half, it contains 50 % of each crude oil. Another possible scenario is a case where, due to the high viscosity of the heavy oil, the heavy oil flow is laminar, while the light oil flow is turbulent (laminar-turbulent configuration). Complications arise when the turbulent flow follows the laminar flow. In other words, when the light <b>oil</b> <b>batch</b> is transported after the heavy <b>oil</b> <b>batch</b> in the same pipeline, a complicated blended zone is created between the batches in which long tails of the heavy oil stretch into the light oil. In these cases, it is very difficult to estimate the phase mass fraction in the blended zone that is created. This study focuses on such cases.|$|R

Attention has been drawn to the use of computational and experimental validation studies aiming at the optimisation and the control of microalgal oil productivity either through the improvement of the growth mechanism or through the application of metabolic engineering methods to microalgae. Optimisation of such a system can be achieved through the evaluation of organic carbon sources, nutrients and water supply, leading to high oil yield. The main objective of this work is to develop a novel integrated experimental and computational approach, utilising a microalgal strain grown at bench-scale, with the aim to systematically identify the conditions that optimise growth and lipid production, in order to ultimately develop a cost-effective process to improve the system economic viability and overall sustainability. To achieve this, a detailed model has been constructed through a multi-parameter quantification methodology taking into account photo-heterotrophic biomass growth. The corresponding growth rate is based on carbon substrate concentration, nitrogen and light availability. The developed model also considers the pH of the medium.

The refining of crude oil requires a series of purification steps to produce quality biodiesel. The objective {{of the study was}} to produce refined oil from brebra seed for biodiesel production. Crude oil extraction was carried out using mechanical press and solvent extraction methods. Impurities of the oil were determined by standard assay methods. Solubility characteristics of precipitates were determined. The data generated from nature of solubility were used to design refining technique. The appropriate method was found to be hexane-ethanol refining techniques. From crude oil extract using solvents, 84. 66 % and 15. 34 % were pure oil and residue, respectively. From crude oil extract by mechanical press, 86. 83 % and 13. 17 % were refined oil and residue, respectively. The quantity of refined oil extract by mechanical press was significantly (p < 0. 05) increased than extracted by hexane. Crude oil contained 4. 4 % protein and 7. 2 % phospholipid.

There are methods for general quality control to map the safety and nutritional value; however {{there is a need for}} suitable analytical methods to verify information such as the production method (wild/farmed), geographical origin, species, and process history of foods. This thesis evaluates the applicability of using nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy combined with pattern recognition techniques for authentication of foodstuffs. Fish and marine oils were chosen as materials. 13 C NMR was applied to authenticate marine oils and muscle lipids of both fatty and lean fish, according to production method (wild/farmed), geographical origin, species, and process history. 1 H NMR was applied on low molecular weight compounds extracted from cod muscle to authenticate fish according to species and processing conditions. 13 C NMR combined with pattern recognition techniques enabled the differentiation of marine oils according to wild/farmed and geographical origin of the raw material. It is suggested that this was mainly due to the different diets of the fish from which the oil was produced. It was also possible to authenticate marine oils according to species, and to say something about the level of mixtures detectable. The sn- 2 position specificity of fatty acids in triacylglycerols was shown to be an important characteristic to separate oils of different species. Esterified fish oil (concentrates) could easily be differentiated from natural fish oil by their 13 C NMR profile. 13 C NMR on muscle lipids, combined with pattern recognition techniques enabled the classification of wild and farmed salmon. The classification according to geographical origin was somewhat more complicated. A combination of analytical methods may be the best approach to obtain reliable results on geographical origin of fish. The analysis of lean fish showed that it was possible to classify lean gadoids according to species, and two stocks of Atlantic cod could be differentiated. There were also minor differences in the sn- 2 position specificity of 22 : 6 n- 3 in phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) among the species investigated. 1 H NMR on water soluble extracts of fish muscle provided information about a wide range of compounds, and the two species investigated (cod and haddock) displayed different 1 HNMR profiles. Dimethylamine (DMA) was used as a marker for frozen, non processed fish. When applying the 1 H NMR data in pattern recognition techniques, frozen fish could be differentiated from non-frozen fish, and in the classification of the cod of the different processing methods 80 % of the samples were correctly classified. Common for the methods presented in this thesis, NMR spectroscopy combined with pattern recognition for authentication of traceability data on foodstuffs, is the need for databases with analytical data on reference samples, covering the natural variation among the samples to be classified.

The effects of varying exposure duration, sample temperature, and location of the sample with respect to the plasma discharge were investigated. For comparative purposes two experiments were conducted in which the sample was heated under nitrogen with no plasma exposure. Distillates containing approximately 28 % less sulfur than the feedstock represented the maximum desulfurization attained in the plasma experiments. It does not appear that plasma reactions using the simple configurations employed in this study represent a viable method for the desulfurization of heavy oils...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Glycerol is the {{principal}} by-product of biodiesel production. For each gallon of biodiesel produced, approximately 0. 3 kg of crude glycerol accompanies. Such crude glycerol possesses very low value because of the impurities contained. As the demand and production of biodiesel grow exponentially, the utilization of the glycerol becomes an urgent topic. The make-up of crude glycerol varies depending on the parent feedstock and the biodiesel production process. Before the crude glycerol could be considered for possible value-added utilizations, {{it is necessary to}} characterize it on its physical, chemical, and nutritional properties. This article reports the characterization of crude glycerol obtained from different seed oil feedstocks of mustard, rapeseed, canola, crambe, soybean, and waste cooking <b>oils.</b> <b>Batch</b> processes of biodiesel production were used as the means of crude glycerol preparation using unrefined vegetable oils, methanol, and sodium methylate as the catalyst. After separation from biodiesel, the crude glycerol from each of the oils was analyzed using ASTM and other standard test methods. Elemental impurities, nutritional value, and other chemical properties were tested...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{repeated}} deep frying of potatoes versus repeated heating/quenching on the chemical profile of palm oil was investigated. The novelty {{of the work}} is that the frying and heating/quenching experiments were conducted under similar time-temperature profiles. The effects of the frying load (potato-to-oil ratio: 1 / 7 and 1 / 35 kgpotatoes/loil) and of the time-temperature profile were examined. Whole palm oil and its polar fraction were analyzed using high pressure size exclusion chromatography. Both repeated frying and repeated heating/quenching generated polar and polymerization products in palm oil. Interestingly, no hydrolysis or other decomposition products were generated under any of the examined conditions. The presence of potatoes during frying in palm oil increased the concentration of polymerization products and polar compounds compared to oils without potatoes significantly. The effects of frying load on oil quality depended on frying time. No significant effect of frying load was observed up to frying times of 13 h (or 10 frying <b>batches).</b> However, frying <b>oil</b> quality was affected by frying load once frying times exceeded 24 h (or 20 batches) ...|$|R
