25|$|Chess on a Really <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> {{is a large}} chess variant {{invented by}} Ralph Betza around 1996. It is played on a 16×16 {{chessboard}} with 16 pieces (on the back rank) and 16 pawns (on the second rank) per player. Since such a board can be constructed by pushing together four standard 8×8 boards, Betza also gave this variant the alternative names of Four Board Chess or Chess on Four Boards.|$|E
500|$|Whammy! [...] {{made use}} of {{technological}} advances that had been developed since the original Press Your Luck ended its run in the 1980s. For example, the prizes and light patterns for each space on the <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> were randomly generated using a personal computer, running at a speed of 200MHz. This resulted in {{a very large number}} of patterns for gameplay, which prevented memorization of patterns as Michael Larson did on Press Your Luck. Also, Whammies were animated in 3D computer graphics, rather than being hand-drawn as on Press Your Luck.|$|E

50|$|There is {{currently}} no known formula for {{the exact number}} of solutions, or even for its asymptotic behaviour. Currentlythe 27x27 board is the highest-order board that has been completely enumerated. Finding a single solution for a <b>bigger</b> <b>board</b> is not difficult.|$|R
2500|$|Betza {{also created}} a second 16×16 variant, which he termed Golden Age Chess on a Really <b>Big</b> <b>Board.</b> He wrote: [...] "This game is {{designed}} to create an open position in which development, initiative, and attack are all-important, the positions are too complex to calculate so you must play by intuition, and you never count Pawns -- in other words, {{a return to the}} Golden Age!" [...] However, he appears to have considered Chess on a Really <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> to be the primary 16×16 game, that could be translated to 3D to make 16×16×16 chess.|$|E
2500|$|The {{inverted}} {{knight in}} the diagram is the rose from Chess on a Really <b>Big</b> <b>Board,</b> and the superknight and archbishop remain the same. The other pieces are as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Chess on a Really <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> {{was created}} as an {{outgrowth}} of Betza's ideas on three-dimensional chess, after he noted that an 8×8×8 board for 3D chess would have 512 spaces, more than any large version of chess {{that had previously been}} invented; he then considered two-dimensional very large (or, in his word, [...] "huge") chess games, mainly on the 16×16 board because such a board requires no non-standard equipment to construct, and while much larger than the 8×8 board, it was not so big as to make an unplayable game. This idea eventually came full circle {{in the development of the}} 16×16×16 three-dimensional version of Chess on a Really <b>Big</b> <b>Board,</b> which he called [...] "impossibly large".|$|E
50|$|The board {{offered a}} variety of GCSE, A Level and other qualifications. Despite its name, schools in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were able to choose any of the {{examination}} boards and NEAB established itself as the <b>biggest</b> <b>board</b> in the UK.|$|R
50|$|Chess Attack, {{which has}} the same setup as Gardner minichess (but played on a <b>bigger</b> <b>board)</b> is sold by Norway company Yes Games AS since 2008. In this variant, pawns can make double-moves and en-passant capture is allowed. The game was {{endorsed}} by Magnus Carlsen and Alexandra Kosteniuk.|$|R
50|$|Besides the {{construction}} of school building a very <b>big</b> <b>boarding</b> hostel and staff colony was also established. The School area spread over 28 acres of land with a play ground, a government Girls High School constructed in 1988.The whole land of 28 acres was donated by Late Rais Perano Jogi.|$|R
2500|$|PakPassion has {{recorded}} a peak Alexa ranking within the top 15,000 (August 2010). Furthermore, in Alexa's regional ranking PakPassion is ranked within the top 1,000 and 10,000 in Pakistan and United Kingdom respectively. It has a <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> ranking inside the top 900, making it amongst {{the most frequently}} visited cricket forums. In November 2009, PakPassion was voted the fourth most popular cricket websites by readers of the Telegraph newspaper ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 the <b>Big</b> <b>Board,</b> as some {{termed the}} NYSE, was {{described}} as the world's [...] "largest and most prestigious stock market". But when the World Trade Center was destroyed on September 11, 2001, it left an architectural void as new developments since the 1970s had played off the complex aesthetically. The attacks [...] "crippled" [...] the communications network. One estimate was that 45% of Wall Street's [...] "best office space" [...] had been lost. The physical destruction was immense: ...|$|E
2500|$|A further {{possibility}} Betza entertained was a 3D {{version of}} Chess on a Really <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> on a 16×16×16 board, which brought its inspiration full circle. On each level, the 2D setup would be repeated, and the pieces' moves would {{be translated into}} three dimensions just as in his idea of 8×8×8 3D chess. Nevertheless, he commented on it: [...] "What an awful idea. Each player has 256 Pawns and 256 pieces. The average length of a game {{is likely to be}} more [...] 2000 moves." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{message board}} {{contains}} separate sub-forums, {{referred to as}} [...] "rooms", that cover {{a wide variety of}} topics including new music, technology, nightlife, culture, sports, men's and women's issues, and politics. It contains over 4 million message posts, {{making it one of the}} largest message boards on the Internet (<b>Big</b> <b>Boards).</b>|$|R

2500|$|E.F. Hutton Building: 623 S. Spring Street – Built in 1931, the 12-story Zig-Zag Moderne E.F. Hutton Building once housed E.F. Hutton's <b>big</b> <b>board.</b> [...] The Hutton and California Canadian Bank {{were the}} first office {{buildings}} to be converted into residences. [...] In 1984, the Community Redevelopment Agency converted the adjacent towers into 121 condominiums in a project called Premiere Towers. [...] However, {{when most of the}} units failed to sell, the agency sold the project to a developer who offered the units for rental—in the process destroying property values for those who had purchased units.|$|E
2500|$|Betza also {{proposed}} a 24×24 version of Chess on a Really <b>Big</b> <b>Board,</b> {{although he did}} not fully design it. His description of the game was [...] "Push 9 boards together in a [...] square, symmetrically replicate all the unique pieces from the Four Board Chess lineup, add a W beside the K, two Fs flanking the K [...] W, and you have a game." [...] The W and F are here the wazir and ferz. This description is however not unique: the diagram shown to the right is one possible interpretation, but others are also consistent with his description. The addition of such weak pieces was intended to balance the duplication of the more powerful pieces.|$|E
2500|$|On May 26, 2011, WPVI debuted {{an hour-long}} 4 p.m. {{newscast}} to replace The Oprah Winfrey Show, which ended its 25-year syndication run one day prior; this edition was broadcast from a smaller news desk located {{next to the}} main anchor desk that only housed the anchors of that newscast and allowed the team to utilize the <b>Big</b> <b>Board</b> more frequently. This changed on June 26, 2017, when the entire news set was redone in a more modernized style and the smaller desk was removed, moving the anchors to the new main desk. The station also introduced [...] "Mobile 6", a news vehicle used for reports during the station's early evening newscasts. In the spring of 2012, the station expanded its weekend 11 p.m. newscasts to one hour. On September 8, 2014, the station's noon newscast also expanded to one full hour as a new daytime schedule was implemented.|$|E
50|$|Up until 1993, Equinox was a pure demo group, {{but then}} started {{to grow at}} large in the trading and board scene as well. Lots of traders and some of Sweden's <b>biggest</b> <b>boards</b> at the time joined the group. Equinox primetime chart, the European Top 20, {{reflected}} this by having lots of board scene related categories and articles.|$|R

They are on <b>big</b> <b>boards</b> placed throughout the school corridors so that students can regularly be reminded of them. The values are placed down in an acrostic fashion to spell out HEART.|$|R

60|$|And {{then as the}} score, Brill 6--Roxley 5, {{was placed}} on the <b>big</b> <b>board</b> a wild yelling, tooting of horns, and {{sounding}} of rattles rent the air. Once more Brill had vanquished its old opponent.|$|E

6000|$|... "Now that," [...] caroled {{the motor}} agent, Eddie Swanson, [...] "that's what I call he-literature! That Prince Albert fellow--though, gosh, there can't {{be just one}} fellow that writes 'em; must be a <b>big</b> <b>board</b> of classy ink-slingers in conference, but anyway: now, him, he doesn't write for {{long-haired}} pikers, he writes for Regular Guys, he writes for ME, and I tip my benny to him! The only thing is: I wonder if it sells the goods? Course, like all these poets, this Prince Albert fellow lets his idea run away with him. It makes elegant reading, but it don't say nothing. I'd never {{go out and buy}} Prince Albert Tobacco after reading it, because it doesn't tell me anything about the stuff. It's just a bunch of fluff." ...|$|E
50|$|As {{the cafe}} gained {{popularity}} it quickly outgrew its seating capacity. In 2011, the adjacent property was purchased {{and the wall}} between the two properties was demolished, adding roughly 2,000 square feet to the existing café and increasing capacity from 45 to 150 seats. With 7,500 square feet of space, Snakes and Lattes was, according to its managers, the <b>biggest</b> <b>board</b> game café {{in the world in}} January 2016.|$|R

50|$|The game {{spread in}} German-Baltic and Prussian noble {{families}} {{until it was}} popularized by Jahn in the entire German-speaking world and in all population strata. Jahn also pursued adult-pedagogical goals with the game: He wanted to educate the working class and {{improve the lives of}} wounded German World War I veterans. His variant of the game is also called Baltic bean game, while another variant, which used a <b>bigger</b> <b>board,</b> is called German bean game.|$|R
60|$|Once {{across the}} swale {{he put his}} pony to a gallop and soon reached Uncle George's homestead. No one at home! The horse and wagon were gone. Pan left his package and turned back. As he trotted past the Blake gate Pan heard a faint call. It startled him. Reining in Curly he listened and looked. Blake's cabin stood back out of sight among the Cottonwoods. The barn, however, with its low open-sided shed, stood just inside the gate. The cows had been brought in for milking. A lusty calf was trying to steal milk from its mother. Chickens were going to roost. Pan {{did not believe that}} any of these had made the call. He was about to ride on by when {{suddenly}} he again caught a strange cry that appeared to come from the barn or shed. It excited rather than frightened him. Sliding off Curly he pushed open the <b>big</b> <b>board</b> gate and ran in.|$|E
6000|$|When {{she came}} down early into the hall, her father's half-dozen {{retainers}} were taking their morning meal {{at one end of}} a <b>big</b> <b>board,</b> while a manchet of bread and a silver cup of ale was ready for each of them at the other, and her father while swallowing his was in deep conversation over northern politics with the courteous Earl, who had come down to speed his guests. As she passed the retainers she heard, [...] "Here comes our Grisly Grisell," [...] and a smothered laugh, and in fact [...] "Grisly Grisell" [...] continued to be her name among the free-spoken people of the north. The Earl broke off, bowed to her, and saw that she was provided, breaking into his conversation with the Baron, evidently much to the impatience of the latter; and again the polite noble came down to the door with her, and placed her on her palfrey, bidding her a kind farewell ere she rode away with her father. It would be long before she met with such courtesy again. Her father called to his side his old, rugged-looking esquire Cuthbert Ridley, and began discussing with him what Lord Warwick had said, both wholly absorbed in the subject, and paying no attention to the girl who rode by the Baron's side, so that it was well that her old infantine training in horsemanship had come back to her.|$|E
60|$|But it {{is never}} too late to mend, so I went into the kitchen this morning and made a tart. You can't imagine what a lot of things one needs even for such a simple thing as that. I thought cook was joking when she put them all down in front of me. It was like a conjurer giving his performance. There was an empty bowl, and a bowl full of sliced apples, and a <b>big</b> <b>board,</b> and a rolling-pin, and eggs, and butter, and sugar, and cloves, and of course flour. We broke eggs and put them into a bowl--you can't think what a mess an egg makes when it misses the bowl. Then we stirred them up with flour and butter and things. I stirred until I was {{perfectly}} exhausted. No wonder a cook has usually a great thick arm. Then when it had formed a paste, we rolled it out, and put the apples in the dish, and roofed it in, and trimmed the edges, and stuck flat leaves made of paste all over it, and the dearest little crown in the middle. Then we put it into the oven until it was brown. It looked a very nice tart, and mamma said that I had made it very solidly. It certainly did feel very heavy for its size. Mamma would not taste it, because she said that she thought Dr. Tristram would not approve of her doing so, but I had a piece, and really it was not so bad. Mamma said the servants might have it at dinner, but the servants said that the poor window-cleaner had a large family, and so we gave it to him. It is so sweet to feel that one is of any use to any one.|$|E
5000|$|Mahogany: has a {{straight}} grain, usually free of voids and pockets. The most prized species come from Cuba and Honduras. It has a reddish-brown color, which darkens over time, and displays a beautiful reddish sheen when polished. It has excellent workability, {{is available in}} <b>big</b> <b>boards,</b> and is very durable. Mahogany {{is used in the}} making of many musical instruments, as drums, acoustic and electric guitars' back and side, and luxury headphones.|$|R
6000|$|Then the {{approach}} to the confused problems of some larger centre of population {{and the presence of}} a more intricate conflict would be marked by roughly smeared notices of [...] "Quarantine" [...] or [...] "Strangers Shot," [...] or by a string of decaying plunderers dangling from the telephone poles at the roadside. About Oxford <b>big</b> <b>boards</b> were put on the roofs warning all air wanderers off with the single word, [...] "Guns." ...|$|R
5000|$|Present-day Surf City {{was home}} to the first <b>big</b> <b>boarding</b> hotel on the Jersey Shore, called the Mansion of Health. The area {{surrounding}} this hotel was called [...] "Buzby's Place" [...] in the 1830s and 1840s, {{after one of the}} owners of the Mansion of Health, Hudson Buzby. The Mansion of Health burned down in 1874, but some old-timers still call the cove at the foot of South First Street on the bay side [...] "Mansion Cove." ...|$|R
