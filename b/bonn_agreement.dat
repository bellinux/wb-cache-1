In the first step, the Afghan Transitional Administration was formed and was installed on December 22, 2001.

25|$|In {{an effort}} {{to make it easier for}} antiwar critics to back Schröder’s {{decision}} to send German Bundeswehr troops to Afghanistan in 2001, Fischer and Development Minister Heidemarie Wieczorek-Zeul announced a 256 million marks ($115 million) humanitarian-aid package for Afghan refugees. In late 2001, Fischer hosted – under the auspices of the United Nations – a ten-day conference at the German government guesthouse above the Rhine River, where delegates from four Afghan factions signed the <b>Bonn</b> <b>Agreement</b> establishing a transitional government for the country to replace the deposed Taliban regime. At the time, Germany's longstanding links to Afghanistan and its 2001 chairmanship of the Afghanistan Support Group of countries pledging humanitarian and reconstruction aid for the country, were the reasons it was picked to host the meeting.|$|E

We consider here the possible role of the different greenhouse gas emissions, and of other factors, in future climate changes, as well as the possible impacts of such changes upon development in various countries. Then, we consider different policies and measures which were discussed at the international level to mitigate climate change. We expose also major outcomes of international negotiations, from the signature of the Convention on climate change in 1992 up to the <b>Bonn</b> and Marrakech <b>agreements</b> in 2001.

50|$|Although early efforts {{had trained}} 35,000 {{officers}} in basic recruit schools during 2003 and 2004, this training was insufficient {{to strengthen the}} structures and senior command levels needed to create an effective police force. Germany, as lead nation for police under the <b>Bonn</b> II <b>Agreement,</b> concentrated its efforts on setting up the Kabul Police Academy and drafted the long range blueprint for restructuring the police services. Except for Kunduz Province which had a Provincial Reconstruction Team (PRT), Germany's program had only limited reach into the provinces. As the US Department of State International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs Bureau's (INL) activity at this time was limited in resources and scope, the US Departments of Defense and State, in 2005, decided to shift {{the implementation of the}} police training and equipment program to the Office of Security Cooperation-Afghanistan (OSC-A), under the authority of the Commanding General, Combined Forces Command (CFC-A). In 2006, OSC-A became the Combined Security Transition Command - Afghanistan (CSTC-A) keeping the OSC-A mission.The 2005 changes led to an increased impetus to implement significant reform programs, particularly the reform of higher staff levels at the Ministry of the Interior, the placement of police mentors throughout the country, substantial pay increases in the police salary plan and an impending, complete restructuring of the police payroll system. A nationwide reassessment of infrastructure and equipment needs was also undertaken, followed with the distribution of critically needed weapons, ammunition, vehicles, and office/dorm furniture. Although {{progress has been made in}} the areas of infrastructure, equipment and payroll distribution, these programs would take some time to reach fruition.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the signing}} of the Kyoto Protocol in December 1997, several authors have {{computed}} the costs of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by the amount specified in the Protocol, while accounting for the possibility to use the flexible mechanisms of the Protocol (internationally tradable emission permits). A number of such studies have recently shown that, following the US withdrawal and the <b>Bonn</b> and Marrakesh <b>agreements,</b> these abatement costs will be very low and the price of the permits could reach zero. However, these analyses usually take only the first commitment period (20082012) into account and do not explicitly consider the possibility of banking permits from one commitment period to the other (Art. 3. 13 of the Protocol). The simple dynamic model that we develop here introduces this possibility. It allows one to analyze the impact of alternative future commitments (post 2012) for the US and the non-Annex B countries on world emissions, abatement costs and the permits price. We find that, provided ambituous post-Kyoto commitments are negotiated: (i) in 2008 - 2012, the amount of banked permits will largely exceed the amount of hot air and permits prices will be much higher than predicted by most other studies, (ii) the banking provision significantly reduces world total costs but increases total costs for all permit-importing Annex B countries (i. e. all Annex B countries except countries of eastern Europe) via a rise in the permits price in 2008 - 2017 and (iii) the issue of market power on hot air {{is not likely to be}} a relevant one.

5000|$|The {{state-building}} roadmap {{that was}} created by the <b>Bonn</b> <b>Agreement</b> was an inappropriate model for the Afghan case, and later led to a range of issues, including government corruption and incompetency. Since the <b>Bonn</b> <b>Agreement</b> failed to provide shared powers within the Afghanistan’s government, it spurred and internal war between two of the country’s “elite networks”, the North Alliance and the Pashtun Faction. As a result, the North Alliance held most of the cabinet positions in Afghanistan’s government and had large decision-making capabilities. This skew in political power and abundant intra-cabinet rivalries was noted in an early World Bank report that stated, “even within central government, current political divisions and rivalries render impossible any meaningful consensus on even the key policy elements of a comprehensive administrative reform program…” The subsequent failures of the Afghan state, including the inability to provide basic security and social services, stemmed from the ‘overambitious reconstruction model’ {{that was created}} by the <b>Bonn</b> <b>Agreement,</b> as well as practical challenges on the ground. Following this event, the Afghan government took on a more informal style in public affairs of pact-making and brokerage.
