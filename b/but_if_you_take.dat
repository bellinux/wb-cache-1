2500|$|The director, Luc Jacquet, has {{condemned}} such {{comparisons between}} penguins and humans. Asked by the San Diego Union Tribune {{to comment on}} the documentary's use as [...] "a metaphor for family values – the devotion to a mate, devotion to offspring, monogamy, self-denial", Jaquet responded: [...] "I condemn this position. I find it intellectually dishonest to impose this viewpoint on something that's part of nature. It's amusing, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> the monogamy argument, from one season to the next, the divorce rate, if you will, is between 80 to 90 percent... the monogamy only lasts for the duration of one reproductive cycle. You have to let penguins be penguins and humans be humans." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nancy forms a {{relationship}} with former tattoo artist Foz. The relationship sees her becoming dependent on him mainly {{because he was a}} hippy and free, which at the time represented everything Nancy stood for. During her relationship with Foz, the character begins abusing drugs. Fox revealed how her character's longing to fit in with people like Foz who were {{different from the rest of}} society, ended with her taking drugs to be different from others but the same as the hippy scene. Fox spoke about this saying: [...] "I think Nancy's character is very strong, she's opinionated, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>take</b> all that away she's still very young particularly then, at the time of the drug storyline she was 16 she still wanted desperately to fit in even though she told everyone she didn't. At that particular party she was at she was surrounded by all these people who were traveling, really into their music, they had the life style that Nancy wanted, and she just desperately wanted to fit in at the end of the day, and that's what happens she took LSD and it went horribly wrong".|$|E

5000|$|Filming {{the series}} was challenging. For example, {{maintaining}} silence and not picking up sounds of cars in the distance made it difficult. In addition to Forte's fascination with Life After People, similar films bandied about while writing the show included The Omega Man, I Am Legend, and 28 Days Later. Fox particularly appreciated {{the heart of the}} story, with its universal theme. According to Lord, [...] "We always talked about that this is a person who is very flawed, and a person who maybe needed the entire world to end in order for him to become his best self. ... That was our big thought, well here's a guy who maybe he wasn't the best guy in the regular world, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>took</b> the regular world away, could he eventually get back to being the person that all of us hope that we can be." ...|$|R
