We study how investors account for the riskiness of banks ’ risk-weighted assets (RWA) by examining the determinants of stock returns and market measures of risk. We find that banks with lower RWA performed better during the US and European crises. This relationship is weaker in Europe where banks can use Basel II internal risk models. For large <b>banks,</b> <b>investors</b> paid less attention to RWA and rewarded instead lower wholesale funding and better asset quality. RWA do not, in general, predict market measures of risk although there is evidence of a positive relationship before the US crisis which becomes negative afterwards...|$|E

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} The {{relationship}} between mutual fund performance and fund flows has been studied widely, but less {{attention has been given}} towards mutual fund launches and their success. For services the company itself plays as the brand, and thus product launch can be viewed as brand line extension. This paper investigates the importance of brand performance, company track record, on the success of mutual fund launch. In Finland the mutual fund industry can be divided roughly into two types of players, retail and non-retail banks, and there fore they will be also investigated separately and the results will be compared. The study was performed on the Finnish mutual fund market and it includes virtually all mutual fund launches between 1997 and 2009. The data is tested using linear regression, and first the significance of the brand performance and additional factors are evaluated based on the whole sample, and later on the importance of the variables for retail and non-retail banks will be compared. Last, the consumer segment will be observed more closely. The results show that the overall company track record, the brand performance, has positive effect on the success of mutual fund launch. When the two company types were compared separately {{it was found that the}} company track record plays more important role for non-retail <b>bank</b> <b>investors</b> whereas for retail <b>bank</b> <b>investors</b> other company and fund related variables were found to be more important.

40|$|Considering the {{increasingly}} international banks of today, {{the health of}} a country's banking sector is crucial not only to the country's growth and prosperity but also {{to the rest of the}} international financial community. Early warning signals of a banking sector in trouble or a pending banking crisis would therefore be of great value to both <b>banks,</b> <b>investors</b> and banking regulators/supervisors world wide. Different warning signals exist and in this paper we investigate how the stock market can provide a market-based indicator of banking sector health. Hall and Miles (1990) suggests an approach of estimating default probabilities of individual banks using only their stock market valuations and volatilities. In this paper we apply an aggregated version of their approach to banking sectors around the world in both developed and emerging economies and study the market's assessment of the probability of systemic banking crises in these countries over the last decade, including the Asian Crisis 1997 - 98. In addition, we investigate whether there is a relationship between the probability of banking sector failure and institutional/structural features of the actual banking sector...|$|E

This forced the Central Bank to spend its foreign reserves to defend Russia's currency, which in turn further eroded investor confidence and undermined the ruble.

40|$|The recent {{financial}} crisis has reinforced the critical need for economic policy to anticipate {{and reduce the}} impact of unexpected, extreme, events. In this paper, we develop a framework based on latent regime shifts to analyze why investors may undertake overly risky investment strategies and how policymakers may attempt to constrain such behavior. This framework ex-plains, in particular, why <b>banks,</b> <b>investors,</b> and policymakers may decide not to hedge against extreme events, even when those events are exogenously determined and have well under-stood probabilities and consequences. We also examine {{cases in which the}} extreme events are endogenously created by the investment strategies themselves. Our most striking finding is that the private costs of sustained suboptimal investment may be bounded and small. Thus, investors may knowingly ignore or exacerbate the likelihood of extreme events, especially if they face informational costs to learning the structure of the financial environment in which the events are created. These results obtain both in the theoretical model and upon calibration to the last half-century of US economic experience. The results provide a strong motivation for policymakers to ensure the full disclosure and dissemination of information regarding the probabilities and consequences of extreme outcomes...|$|E
40|$|The {{network model}} of {{organization}} plays {{a central role}} in recent sociological accounts of the information economy. This model is also often presented in organization and information and communication technologies (ICT) literature with an air of enthusiasm that underscores its advantages [...] flexibility, cooperative culture, innovativeness, and knowledge and technology intensity. Such themes are usually based on a "networking logic" that assumes the trustful cooperation of large and small production firms in a rapidly changing economic environment. We believe that both the logic and the themes based upon it are too narrow to be able to explain the complex dimensions of interorganizational networking. Using Enron as a case study, our goal in this article is to enrich the logic just described and to develop an extended model of the network enterprise. We argue that this is only possible by extending the unit of analysis beyond the production firm, to include, among others, subsidiaries, <b>banks,</b> <b>investors,</b> auditors, and government agencies. The proposed extended model allows the broadening of many of the aforementioned themes, making it possible to arrive at a realistic picture of the complexities of the network enterprise. The managerial advantages of the model are also discussed...|$|E

However, the negative side of the internationalization of economic life is a reality, the country risk being an important vector of it. More than a mere academic specialty, the concept of country risk has now become an operational necessity, being the focus of analysis institutions (rating agencies, for example), but also of the different categories of agents interested in ratings (governmental creditors, various borrowers, <b>banks,</b> <b>investors,</b> multinational companies, exporters, etc.). Currently, risk assessment in the world of international businesses differs significantly from that methodology used several decades ago; risks have multiplied and diversified, and are present in any international economic transaction. Foreign direct investments in particular face the problem of country risk; it covers all the obstacles that affect the implantation process - administrative, institutional and social behaviors and practices that discourage the investment. In order to improve economic decisions, a serious study of the country risk is necessary; this analysis is based on fundamental issues accompanying economic, financial and political imbalances. country risk, globalization, foreign direct investments, multinational companies, ratings...|$|E
