40|$|The {{availability}} of an anaerobic reactor is low {{because of the}} very long relaxing period {{in case of a}} breakdown of the population. Therefore anaerobic systems are limited to few types of industrial and agricultural effluents with high biodegradability. The fixed bed reactor with tower packing is one way to a steady process with a high decomposition rate. Plastic waste products are often used as carrier for bio films because of their low costs, but their characteristics are not optimal and contain the risk of toxic or inhibiting additives. So called high-rate fixed bed reactors use modern contact materials made from special porous glass e. g. Siran and others. The implementation of these systems is combined with high costs concerning the fixed bed and the peripheral equipment. Special granules for waste water treatment process were manufactured and tested at the FILK gGmbH, Freiberg. The efforts aimed at multiple utilisation as well as physical and biological filter as fixed and fluidized bed. Summarizing the expected features: 1. low budget production, 2. adhesion of <b>biological</b> <b>slime,</b> 3. physical/chemical adsorption, 4. nutrient and trace components. Various kinds of test specimens were created by extrusion of foamed polyethylene (PE-LD) and additives. The adsorption depends on pore structure and surface and distribution of pore sizes. Macropores combined with a hydrophilic micro relief speed up the settlement of <b>biological</b> <b>slime</b> and improve the density of colonization. The adhesion of bio film depends on the water sorption. The SEM-analysis showed an open micropore structure of the material. The porosity, adsorption rate and hydrophilic features of the granules were estimated. Various types of aerobic bench-scale reactors were operated some months. The feed was as well as synthetic substrate as industrial effluents from the manufacturing process of automotive upholstery leather. The reactors were modified with application of a co-substrate dosage of enzymes cross-flow filtration and a wet-oxidation process. The biomass in the reactor was measured finally.

40|$|The {{performance}} of greywater treatment through RBC (Rotating Biological Contactor) {{is related to}} many factors including rotational speed of disc, surface area of the media, thickness of biological film; quality and flow rate of influent. The plastic media provides surface for <b>biological</b> <b>slime.</b> The slime is rotated alternatively into the settled wastewater and then into atmosphere to provide aerobic conditions for the microorganisms. In this study the {{performance of}} RBC is investigated at different flow rates and disk areas of media by introducing additional discs on the shaft of RBC. Initially efficiency of the RBC was observed on six flow rates at the disc area of 9. 78 m 2. Furthermore optimized three flow rates were used to augment the disk area. The efficiency of RBC system was improved significantly at disk area of 11. 76 m 2 and flow rate of 20 L/h.

40|$|Hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) is a {{major issue}} in {{wastewater}} collection systems. H 2 S can cause rapid damage to wastewater infrastructure, affects the public’s quality of life through odor issues and is a safety concern for sewer workers. Relatively recent development and introduction of H 2 S data loggers has shown that H 2 S concentrations in the sewer headspace demonstrate a diurnal pattern that is not explained by current models. Odor complaints and toxicity are primarily a result of the peak concentration levels and may be more accurately predicted through {{a better understanding of the}} diurnal H 2 S concentration patterns. <b>Biological</b> <b>slime</b> layer grows in the submerged portion of sanitary sewer pipes and is the primary source of H 2 S in the sewer atmosphere. The diurnal hydraulic cycle common to sanitary sewer systems results in the periodic exposure of a portion of the slime layer. It was hypothesized that the diurnally exposed slime layer impacts the sewer atmosphere concentration of H 2 S. Utilizing laboratory style tests in a field sewer system showed that the slime layer, when exposed to the sewer atmosphere, will remove H 2 S. This has not been previously demonstrated and helps explain the diurnal H 2 S variation in the sewer atmosphere. Civil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|<b>Biological</b> <b>slimes</b> (biofilms) {{collected}} from the wet end of paper and board machines were examined by electron microscopy and analyzed for fatty acid composition, neutral sugar composition, and ATP. Electron microscopy revealed minuscule prokaryotic organisms (diameter, 0. 2 to 0. 4 μm). Larger cells morphologically resembling Sphaerotilus and Leptothrix spp. were found in slimes from machines using recycled fiber or unbleached pulp. The bacteria were embedded in a slimy matrix and often contained reserve materials microscopically resembling poly-β-hydroxybutyrate and glycogen. Fatty acid analysis of the slimes revealed bacterial signature fatty acids in concentrations equivalent {{to the presence of}} 2 × 1010 to 2. 6 × 1012 (average, 7 × 1011) bacterial cells (live and dead) per g (dry weight) of slime. The slimes contained several known components of bacterial polysaccharides in addition to glucose, indicating that the slime body consisted of bacterial polysaccharides. The slimes contained uronic acids equivalent to a binding capacity of 12. 5 to 50 μmol of divalent cations per g (dry weight) of slime. The uronic acid-containing polysaccharides may be responsible for the accumulation of heavy metals in the slime. Calculation of the ATP contents of the slimes resulted in an estimate of 5 × 1012 cells per g (dry weight) of slime when calibrated with pure bacterial cultures isolated from the slimes. From electron micrographs, an estimate ranging from 1 × 1010 to 1. 5 × 1012 (average, 4 × 1011) cells per g (dry weight) of slime was obtained...|$|R
40|$|The in situ {{microbiota}} {{from several}} aquaculture facilities with active nitrification was examined by {{transmission electron microscopy}} of thin sections {{for the presence of}} bacteria that contained intracytoplasmic membranes characteristic of the nitrifying bacteria.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of a rotary-tube type of trickling filter for removing coxsackievirus A 9, poliovirus 1, and echovirus 12 suspended in raw settled sewage was investigated. At filtration rates equivalent to about 10 MGD (million gallons per day) /acre (ca. 3, 785 m 3 /day per acre), the filters removed 95 % of the poliovirus, 83 % of echovirus 12, and 94 % of coxsackievirus A 9. Coliform, fecal streptococci, bio{{chemical oxygen demand}}, and chemical oxygen demand removals were remarkably similar, averaging 94, 92, 93, and 95 %, respectively. At filtration rates equivalent to about 23 MGD/acre, 59 % of the poliovirus, 63 % of the echovirus 23, and 81 % of the coxsackievirus A 9 were removed. Coliform, fecal streptococci, biochemical oxygen demand, and chemical oxygen demand removals at this filtration rate were 68, 75, 72, and 56 %, respectively. Viruses were assumed to be adsorbed to the <b>biological</b> <b>slime</b> growing in the filters, but attempts to disassociate the viruses from the slime were unsuccessful, indicating that the slime-virus complex is very stable or that the viruses were somehow inactivated. The data indicate that coliform and fecal streptococci reductions in this type sewage treatment process {{can be used as}} an index of virus reduction. Disinfection, however, must be used to ensure a virus-free final effluent...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is composed}} of three journal styled academic papers, which presents research on characterizing surface transportation network structure and resilience. The papers leverage tools in network science, biomimicry, and complex networks to investigate structure and resilience in surface transportation networks. The analysis was conducted using examples of existing road and rail transportation networks, and a feeding network of Physarum Polycephalum (slime mold). The first study investigated the networks’ structure {{to determine if they}} exhibited scale free and small world characteristics. The hypothesis was that a network’s structure endowed it with certain characteristics that made it more efficient and robust in its performance. The second study evaluated resilience in surface transportation networks from a topological structure perspective. The networks were subjected to link based disruptions that deactivated them from the network using two strategies; a targeted and a random strategy. The last study evaluated resilience of surface transportation networks to random disruptions using a user equilibrium framework. Using real life demand data, the networks were loaded with vehicle trip data and randomly disrupted. The networks were evaluated based on the deterioration in total system travel time with random link disruption. It was observed that the <b>biological</b> <b>slime</b> mold network was able to provide a higher level of resilience to degradation in total system travel time in response to disruption, because it contained redundant and alternative link connections between its nodes. It was established that the availability of alternative links to provide redundant capacity in the network, minimized impacts of disruptions...|$|E
40|$|During 1986 and 1987, the City and County of Honolulu Board of Water Supply (BWS) placed {{granular}} {{activated carbon}} (GAC) water treatment plants in service at Mililani, Waipahu, and Kunia {{on the island of}} O'ahu, Hawai'i. The GAC treatment plants were designed to remove target organic chemicals DBCP, EDB, and TCP from well water in central O'ahu. Original operational cost estimates for the GAC treatment plants were based on carbon requirements determined through laboratory minicolumn experiments. Actual carbon usage rates, however, have proved to be several times higher than originally estimated. This study, which represents the first phase of a two-phase study to determine the potential for extending the effective life of GAC used to remove target organic chemicals from groundwater in central O'ahu, addresses the basic information necessary to understand the problem. Levels of target organic compounds in groundwater in the Pearl Harbor aquifer of central O’ahu {{do not appear to be}} decreasing significantly. In fact, based on the analysis of spent GAC samples from contactors at the Waipahu treatment facility, DBCP, which was previously undetected at the Waipahu wells, now appears to be occurring at low levels of a few nanograms per liter in groundwater near Waipahu. Analyses of spent carbon samples also indicate that the adsorptive capacity of the GAC for a particular compound is directly related to the concentration of that compound in the influent water. Total organic carbon (TOC) levels in groundwater samples from the Pearl Harbor basaltic aquifer are typically a few tenths of a milligram per liter. This concentration of background organics is two to three orders of magnitude greater than TCP, which is the target organic compound typically found at the highest concentrations in groundwater in the study area. TOC and infrared analyses indicate the presence of background organic compounds in groundwater, a factor which could shorten the service life of GAC contactors. Results of this study seem to indicate that inorganic cations and anions are not significantly adsorbed by the GAC. In addition to chemical effects, bacterial growth may also play a role in the adsorption of target organic compounds. Although -attached bacteria were recovered from spent GAC samples, subsequent scanning electron microscope analysis did not reveal a significant <b>biological</b> <b>slime</b> layer which may inhibit adsorption.

40|$|Plasmodia {{of a true}} slime mold, Physarum polycephalum, {{synthesize}} slime polysaccharide and secrete {{it outside}} the organisms. This substance was shown to be synthesized and polymerized with cell growth. And when the cells reached a plateau of growth in a nutrient medium, degradation of the polysaccharide and autolysis of the cells occurred. The composition of polysaccharides from different strains of Physarum, F/J or Lu strains, were almost the same, but polymerization rates of them were different. We purified the polysaccharides from these two strains and characterized them. Both of them mainly consisted of galactose (Gal) residue having phosphate (-PO_ 4) and sulfate (-SO_ 4) moieties, and the molar ratios of these constituents were 9 : 1 : 1 for F/J and 9 : 2 : 1 for Lu, respectively.

40|$|Nanobacteria {{or living}} nanovesicles are of great {{interest}} to the scientific community because of their dual nature: on the one hand, they appear as primal biosystems originating life; on the other hand, they can cause severe diseases. Their survival as well as their pathogenic potential is apparently linked to a self-synthesized protein-based slime, rich in calcium and phosphate (when available). Here, we provide challenging evidence for the occurrence of nanobacteria in the stratosphere, reflecting a possibly primordial provenance of the slime. An analysis of the <b>slime’s</b> <b>biological</b> functions may lead to novel strategies suitable to block adhesion modalities in modern bacterial populations. Keywords: nanobacteria • living nanovesicles • primordial proteins • atmosphere Evolutionary Functions of Primordial Proteins Proteomics focuses on the structure and function of proteins. While it is impossible to analyze the structures without the adequate laboratory equipment, functional aspects, frequently dictating the structures, can be studied in models. Primordial biosystems represent here a particularly attractive field, as they can lead us to an understanding of some primal key-functions proteins must have had. This implies the identification of still existing and still vital primordial biosystemsssurvivalists. Models predict that nanobacteria (NB) can survive extreme conditions in space by protecting themselves from desiccation with a self-synthesized slime that seals their mineral shells. 1 In the bacterial world, slime has principally one function: to establish stable bonds to surfaces encouraging the formation of complex multispecies communities (biofilms), thereby enhancing conditions for a physical contact between individuals, a precondition for horizontal gene transfer. 2 Biofilms are known to elevate the chances of survival of clinically relevant microorganisms. 3 I...|$|R
40|$|The use of live {{biological}} substrates in {{the fabrication}} of unconventional computing (UC) devices is steadily transcending the barriers between science fiction and reality, but efforts {{in this direction}} are impeded by ethical considerations, the field’s restrictively broad multidisciplinarity and our incomplete knowledge of fundamental biological processes. As such, very few functional prototypes of biological UC devices have been produced to date. This thesis aims to demonstrate the computational polymorphism and polyfunctionality of a chosen <b>biological</b> substrate — <b>slime</b> mould Physarum polycephalum, an arguably ‘simple’ single-celled organism — and how these properties can be harnessed to create laboratory experimental prototypes of functionally-useful biological UC prototypes. Computing devices utilising live slime mould as their key constituent element can be developed into a) heterotic, or hybrid devices, {{which are based on}} electrical recognition of slime mould behaviour via machine-organism interfaces, b) whole-organism-scale morphological processors, whose output is the organism’s morphological adaptation to environmental stimuli (input) and c) intracellular processors wherein data are represented by energetic signalling events mediated by the cytoskeleton, a nano-scale protein network. It is demonstrated that each category of device is capable of implementing logic and furthermore, specific applications for each class may be engineered, such as image processing applications for morphological processors and biosensors in the case of heterotic devices. The results presented are supported by a range of computer modelling experiments using cellular automata and multi-agent modelling. We conclude that P. polycephalum is a polymorphic UC substrate insofar as it can process multimodal sensory input and polyfunctional in its demonstrable ability to undertake a variety of computing problems. Furthermore, our results are highly applicable to the study of other living UC substrates and will inform future work in UC, biosensing, and biomedicine...|$|R
