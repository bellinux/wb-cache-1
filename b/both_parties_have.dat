25|$|On 3 November 2005, the Polisario Front {{signed the}} Geneva Call, {{committing}} {{itself to a}} total ban on landmines, and later began to destroy its landmine stockpiles under international supervision. Morocco is one of 40 governments that have not signed the 1997 mine ban treaty. <b>Both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> used mines extensively in the conflict, but some mine-clearing operations {{have been carried out}} under MINURSO supervision since the ceasefire agreement.|$|E
25|$|On April 26, 2010, Ortiz {{was arrested}} for felony {{domestic}} abuse at the couple's Huntington Beach, California home. Jameson was photographed afterward that day with a bandaged arm, amid accusations by both parties against each other, with Ortiz accusing Jameson of being erratic and addicted to OxyContin, while she alleged that he was abusive. Since the incident occurred, <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> recanted these allegations that were made toward one another, though as of April 29, 2010, the investigation by the police department remained open.|$|E

50|$|In the Franco-Japanese Treaty of 1907, <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> stated their {{commitment}} to the territorial integrity of China, as well as their support of the Open Door Policy, but also stated that <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>had</b> a “special interest” in maintaining peace and order in areas of China adjacent to territories where <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>had</b> rights of sovereignty, protection or occupation. The non-public supplement of the agreement defined these areas as Manchuria, Mongolia and the province of Fukien for Japan, and the provinces of Yunnan, Guangxi and Guangdong for France.|$|R
50|$|Boutros-Ghali later {{informed}} the Council on 11 November 1992, that <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>had</b> agreed to {{his proposal to}} end the conflict by 15 December 1992.|$|R
25|$|Hurt {{began his}} {{political}} career {{as a member of}} the Chatham Town Council. He was elected with 82percent of the vote. Hurt was first elected to the House of Delegates in 2001and served three terms. He represented the 16th District, which includes part of Pittsylvania County. He was elected and re-elected to the House of Delegates with at least 62percent of the vote. He cited bringing the New College Institute and the Virginia Museum of Natural History as accomplishments that he and other legislators of <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> worked together to bring to the area.|$|E
25|$|In {{trying to}} {{determine}} the impact of new media on political campaigning and electioneering, the existing research has tried to examine whether new media supplants conventional media. Television is still the dominant news source, but new media's reach is growing. What is known is that new media has {{had a significant impact}} on elections and what began in the 2008 presidential campaign established new standards for how campaigns would be run. Since then, campaigns also have their outreach methods by developing targeted messages for specific audiences that can be reached via different social media platforms. <b>Both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> specific digital media strategies designed for voter outreach.|$|E
25|$|Johan Bäckman is {{a son of}} Erkki Bäckman who was a Managing Director of Hartwall {{beverage}} company. Johan Bäckman has litigated over {{child custody}} against his Soviet-born ex-wife for years in which <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> received sentences for libel. Bäckman's current family consists of a girl and two boys. His wife is a Russian language and literature teacher. According to Helsingin Sanomat, Bäckman had been treated with caution in the Finnish public media because he is sensitive to what he considers to be journalistic libels. According to the newspaper he has won a court case two times, but equally self-convicted of libel in July 2009.|$|E
50|$|<b>Both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>had</b> {{been part}} of Levi Eshkol's {{coalition}} government, as they {{were associated with the}} Alignment, and the new party assumed their place as a coalition member.|$|R
5000|$|Lawyers {{for former}} Wang {{employees}} Flor Duarte and Wenyu Lu declined to comment. However, {{it was reported}} that <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>had</b> agreed to a settlement with undisclosed terms ...|$|R
50|$|By 1796, <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>had</b> a {{national}} network of newspapers, which attacked each other vehemently. The Federalist and Republican newspapers of the 1790s traded vicious barbs against their enemies.|$|R
25|$|In {{this dispute}} {{it can be}} {{inferred}} that Katznelson and, Schlesinger and Patterson, have only disagreed on their inference of the historical evidence. While <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> agreed {{that the federal government}} expanded and, even, that states had a degree of control over the allocation of federal funds, they have disputed the consequences of these claims. Katznelson has asserted that it created mutual acquiescence between the levels of government, while Schlesinger and Patterson have suggested that it provoked contempt for the state governments {{on the part of the}} federal government, and vice versa, thus exacerbating their relations. In short, irrespective of the interpretation this era marked an important time in the historiography of federalism and also nevertheless provided some narrative on the legacy of federal-state relations.|$|E
25|$|On May 19, Roberto Madrazo, presidential {{candidate}} for the PRI, considered by all polls {{to be in a}} distant third place, hinted at the possibility of an alliance with López Obrador to prevent Calderón from winning the election, after both the parties had criticized the government for what, in their opinion, is supposed illegal support by the federal government for the National Action Party (PAN) candidate's campaigning. The PRD has said that <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> entered into an information sharing agreement regarding the issue. This, combined with calls from high ranking PRI member Manuel Bartlett (former interior secretary when the alleged 1988 presidential election fraud was committed) to vote for López, aroused media speculation that the PRI and the PRD would indeed ally.|$|E
25|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{elections}} were called, the Social Liberal Party stated that they supported a government led by the Social Democrats. The Red-Green Alliance support a left-wing government almost by default. The Socialist People's Party also support a left-wing government, and have stated that they wish to not only support such a government but {{to be a part}} of it. In spite of a dramatic increase in support of the Socialist People's Party in opinion polls, these four parties never stood to get enough seats in parliament to head a government. Consequently, prior to the election, Helle Thorning-Schmidt (the leader of the Social Democrats) invited both New Alliance and the Conservative People's Party to participate in a centre-left government, but <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> refused.|$|E

50|$|As to {{the third}} point, the ISMAC, with the {{co-operation}} of <b>both</b> <b>parties,</b> <b>had</b> by 12 February 1950 completed the removal of military installations, mines and fortifications from the demilitarized zones as specified in the GAA.|$|R
25|$|The {{region is}} set to reach a final {{decision}} {{on the future of}} I-81 with input from many local groups, or stakeholders. In early May 2011, this official process was started by two entities: NYSDOT and the Syracuse Metropolitan Transportation Council (SMTC), the region’s metropolitan planning organization. NYSDOT is responsible for overseeing the process and, eventually, its construction. SMTC consists of member agencies that have a stake in transportation decisions in Central New York. <b>Both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> yet to reach a decision, but they hope to eventually reach one that {{is in the best interest}} for everyone in the greater Syracuse area. In late March 2011, SMTC and NYSDOT announced the formation of the I-81 Community Liaison Committee (CLC). The CLC is made up of representatives from 37organizations and will give ideas and point out concerns about the future of I-81 in Syracuse.|$|E
25|$|New York's {{political}} pattern {{changed little}} after the mid–19th century. New York City and its metropolitan area was already heavily Democrat; Upstate was {{aligned with the}} Republican Party and was a center of abolitionist activists. In the 1850s, Democratic Tammany Hall {{became one of the}} most powerful and durable political machines in United States history. Boss William Tweed brought the organization to the forefront of city and then state politics in the 1860s. Based on its command of a large population, Tammany maintained influence until at least the 1930s. Outside the city, Republicans were able to influence the redistricting process enough to constrain New York City and capture control of the Legislature in 1894. <b>Both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> seen national political success: in the 39 presidential elections between 1856 and 2010, Republicans won 19 times and Democrats 20 times.|$|E
25|$|Unions and {{employers}} have also employed arbitration to resolve employee and union grievances arising under a collective bargaining agreement. The Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America made arbitration a central {{element of the}} Protocol of Peace it negotiated with garment manufacturers in the second {{decade of the twentieth}} century. Grievance arbitration became even more popular during World War II, when most unions had adopted a no-strike pledge. The War Labor Board, which attempted to mediate disputes over contract terms, pressed for inclusion of grievance arbitration in collective bargaining agreements. The Supreme Court subsequently made labor arbitration a key aspect of federal labor policy in three cases which {{came to be known as}} the Steelworkers' Trilogy. The Court held that grievance arbitration was a preferred dispute resolution technique and that courts could not overturn arbitrators' awards unless the award does not draw its essence from the collective bargaining agreement. State and federal statutes may allow vacating an award on narrow grounds (e.g., fraud). These protections for arbitrator awards are premised on the union-management system, which provides both parties with due process. Due process in this context means that <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> experienced representation throughout the process, and that the arbitrators practice only as neutrals. See National Academy of Arbitrators.|$|E
50|$|The {{battle of}} Caill-Cobhthaigh was gained over the Sil-Muireadhaigh {{by the people}} of Upper Connaught, the former having come on a predatory {{excursion}} into Munster; and <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>having</b> engaged through mistake, the Sil-Muireadhaigh left their spoils behind.|$|R
50|$|The court {{eventually}} {{concluded that}} <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>had</b> {{rights to the}} ball and neither could be deprived of it lawfully, and the best solution was an equitable division. The two of them would sell the ball and split the proceeds evenly.|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Solano {{defected}} from PUSC, citing {{problems with}} PUSC and the National Liberation Party, the other ruling party.

500|$|In federal {{elections}} since 2006, <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> seen successes. Republican Senator George Allen lost close {{races in}} 2006, to Democratic newcomer Jim Webb, {{and again in}} 2012, to Webb's replacement, former Governor Tim Kaine. In 2008, Democrats won both United States Senate seats; former Governor Mark Warner was elected to replace retiring Republican John Warner. [...] The state went Republican in 13 out of 14 presidential elections from 1952 to 2004, including 10 in a row from 1968 to 2004. However, Democrat Barack Obama carried Virginia's 13 electoral votes in both the 2008 and 2012 presidential elections. In the 2010 elections, Republicans won three United States House of Representatives seats from the Democrats. Of the state's eleven seats in the House of Representatives, Republicans hold seven and Democrats hold four. Virginia is considered a [...] "swing state" [...] in future presidential elections.|$|E
500|$|Labour {{remained}} the largest Assembly party following the 2007 election, winning 26 of the 60 seats. Having insufficient support {{to form a}} government, the Labour Party entered into the 'One Wales' agreement with Plaid Cymru, forming a coalition, with the Labour leader as First Minister. Carwyn Jones has been First Minister and leader of Welsh Labour since Rhodri Morgan retired from office in December 2009, after nine years and ten months as First Minister. Ieuan Wyn Jones, Deputy First Minister in the coalition government, was leader of Plaid Cymru, the second-largest party in the Assembly with 14 of the 60 seats. Under the 'One Wales' agreement, a referendum on giving the Welsh assembly full law-making powers was promised [...] "as soon as practicable, at or {{before the end of}} the assembly term (in 2011)" [...] and <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> agreed [...] "in good faith to campaign for a successful outcome to such a referendum".|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Sheen had a {{supporting}} role in the science fiction sequel [...] Referring to his David Bowie-esque character, Sheen has said, [...] "I was paid to show off basically". The Wall Street Journal found little fun in the movie [...] "except for a gleefully campy turn by Michael Sheen" [...] while The New York Times said he [...] "shows up to deliver {{the closest thing to}} a performance in the movie". The Daily Telegraph felt his [...] "lively hamming as a cane-swishing nightclub owner merely underlines how impersonal—how inhuman—much else here is". However, USA Today felt his [...] "scenery-chewing performance ... is meant as comic relief, but this movie thunders along so seriously that the attempt at humor feels jarring". In other 2010 film work, Sheen provided the voices for characters in Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland and Disney's Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue and appeared as a terrorist in Unthinkable. On television, Sheen's performance in the third instalment of Peter Morgan's Blair trilogy, The Special Relationship, was nominated for an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor – Miniseries or Movie. The HBO film examined the [...] "special relationship" [...] between the US and the UK in the political era of Blair and Bill Clinton. It was the sixth collaboration between Sheen and Peter Morgan; <b>both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> since said they will not work together again [...] "for the foreseeable future". Sheen also made a guest appearance in four episodes of NBC's 30 Rock as Wesley Snipes, a love interest for Tina Fey's Liz Lemon. Fey, the sitcom's star and creator, has said that [...] "he was so funny and delightful to work with". In November 2010, Sheen received the BAFTA Britannia Award for British Artist of the Year.|$|E

2500|$|Judy Ann Santos, the film's star, was {{involved}} in a minor controversy when her home network, ABS-CBN, refused to promote Ploning and instead chose to promote the film When Love Begins.

In August 2008, she returned to Cuyo to grace the screenings and was awarded as the town's [...] "adopted daughter." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 19 February 2007 Disney lost a {{court case}} in Los Angeles which ruled their [...] "misguided claims" [...] to dispute the {{licensing}} agreements with Slesinger, Inc. were unjustified, but a federal ruling of 28 September 2009, again from Judge Florence-Marie Cooper, determined that the Slesinger family had granted all trademark and copyright rights to Disney, although Disney must pay royalties for all future use of the characters. <b>Both</b> <b>parties</b> <b>have</b> expressed satisfaction with the outcome.|$|E
