40|$|Mouse {{models of}} {{thromboembolism}} are frequently used to investigate platelet function in vivo and, according to European Union (EU) legislation, must {{be conducted in}} the context of replacement, refinement and reduction. We have previously developed a refined real-time mouse model of thromboembolism as an alternative to models of thromboembolic mortality which inflict considerable pain and suffering. Real-time monitoring involves infusion of radiolabelled platelets into the circulation of anaesthetized mice, and platelet aggregation is measured as increases in platelet-associated counts in the pulmonary vasculature following injection of platelet agonists. This gives a definitive data set on the tissue localization and extent of platelet activation. We developed an additional, more simplistic alternative to mortality models based on <b>blood</b> <b>microsampling</b> which entails the measurement of circulating platelet counts following agonist stimulation. <b>Blood</b> <b>microsamples</b> were collected from the tail vein of anaesthetized mice at three different time points leading to a reduction in animal numbers. Platelet counts significantly dropped 1 minute after stimulation with collagen or thrombin and were restored over 10 minutes. These results correlate with those obtained via real-time monitoring and were confirmed by immunohistochemistry. Pre-treatment of mice with aspirin significantly inhibited the decrease in platelet counts following collagen. These data suggest that <b>blood</b> <b>microsampling</b> may be implemented as a simplistic refined alternative to mortality models of thromboembolism when specialized monitoring equipment, or use of radioactive isotopes for real-time monitoring, which remains the ‘gold standard’, is not feasible. Microsampling refines and reduces animal procedures in compliance with current EU legislatio...|$|R

40|$|Pharmacokinetic (PK) {{studies on}} small animals are {{challenging}} as only small volumes of samples are available, {{in which the}} analyte is present at low concentration in a complex matrix. In this context, the use of miniaturized analytical techniques may provide undeniable advantages in terms of sensitivity, sample and solvent consumption compared to the reference UHPLC-MS/MS methods In this study, we present {{the development of a}} nanofluidic-LC-MS/MS method to analyze two model analytes of therapeutic interest, namely estradiol (E 2) and estetrol (E 4) after microsampling with volumetric absorptive <b>microsampling</b> (VAMS) <b>devices,</b> an innovative sampling technique to collect small volumes of whole blood. The nanofluidic LC-MS/MS method was developed using an experimental design to find the optimal conditions to analyze both E 2 and E 4 with the highest sensitivity. Subsequently, the optimized method was validated according to ICH guidelines and compared to a previously developed UHPLC-MS/MS method. A limit of quantitation of 50. pg/ml was reached with the LC-chip method, which is 50 times better than UHPLC-MS/MS. Both methods were then critically evaluated from the analytical and operational points of view. Finally, the quantitation of estrogens after whole <b>blood</b> <b>microsampling</b> was compared with the results obtained with the corresponding plasma samples. © 2017 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Volumetric {{absorptive}} microsampling (VAMS) {{is a novel}} {{sampling technique}} that allows the straightforward collection of an accurate volume of blood (approximately 10 mu L) from a drop or pool of blood by dipping an absorbent polymeric tip into it. The resulting <b>blood</b> <b>microsample</b> is dried and analyzed as a whole. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the potential of VAMS to overcome the hematocrit bias, an important issue in the analysis of dried <b>blood</b> <b>microsamples.</b> An LC-MS/MS method for analysis of the model compounds caffeine and paraxanthine in VAMS samples was fully validated and fulfilled all pre-established criteria. In conjunction with previously validated procedures for dried blood spots (DBS) and blood, this allowed us to set up a meticulous comparative study in which both compounds were determined in over 80 corresponding VAMS, DBS and liquid whole blood samples. These originated from authentic human patient samples, covering a wide hematocrit range (0. 21 - 0. 50). By calculating the differences with reference whole blood concentrations, we found that analyte concentrations in VAMS samples were not affected by a bias that changed over the evaluated hematocrit range, in contrast to DBS results. However, VAMS concentrations tend to overestimate whole blood concentrations, as a consistent positive bias was observed. A different behavior of VAMS samples prepared from incurred and spiked blood, combined with a somewhat reduced recovery of caffeine and paraxanthine from VAMS tips at high hematocrit values, an effect that was not observed for DBS using a very similar extraction procedure, was found to be at the basis of the observed VAMS-whole blood deviations. Based on this study, being the first in which the validity and robustness of VAMS is evaluated by analyzing incurred human samples, it can be concluded that VAMS effectively assists in eliminating the effect of hematocrit...|$|R
40|$|A vapour-phase {{microwave}} pressure digestion technique {{employing a}} special polytetrafluoroethylene-based <b>microsampling</b> <b>device</b> was evaluated for the acid digestion of marine sediment and biological tissue samples {{prior to the}} determination of their trace and minor element content. Inorganic and organic constituents are almost completely solubilized by vapour-phase attack (with an HNO 32 ̆ 013 HF mixture for the marine sediment and HNO 3 for the marine biological tissue) in a perfluoroalkoxy-Teflon pressure bomb. The residue was taken up in 0. 5 mol dm 2 ̆ 0133 HNO 3 and analysed by flame and electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry. Good agreement between the results and certified values for 15 elements was found.

40|$|Dried blood spots (DBS) are {{drops of}} {{capillary}} blood collected onto filter paper from a finger prick. They have many advantages compared with traditional phlebotomy and enable patients to take samples at home. A DBS collection device {{was developed and}} incorporated into a CE marked DBS collection kit. This was successfully used in an international direct access vitamin D DBS service. A random access DBS CRP method was established for use with the DBS collection device and a new <b>microsampling</b> <b>device</b> called the Mitra. The quality of DBS received {{and the impact of}} lancet type was assessed and the effect of blood spot characteristics on CRP and vitamin D concentration was examined. The vitamin D service uptake and the population using it was analysed. The vitamin D concentration and status of users was compared to serum samples received in the laboratory from the local GP population. Significant differences between the populations were seen, with DBS users showing higher levels of vitamin D. In addition, the response to vitamin D testing for both populations was analysed. A higher rate of high to toxic vitamin D levels was seen in the blood spot population and the reasons for this were explored...|$|R
40|$|Human {{growth hormone}} (hGH) and bovine neurophysin (bNP) DNA {{reporter}} fragments were {{inserted into the}} rat vasopressin (VP) and oxytocin (OT) genes in a 44 kb cosmid construct used to generate two lines of transgenic rats, termed JP 17 and JP 59. Both lines showed specific hGH expression in magnocellular VP cells in the hypothalamic paraventricular (PVN) and supraoptic nuclei (SON). hGH was also expressed in parvocellular neurones in suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN), medial amygdala and habenular nuclei in JP 17 rats; the rat OT-bNP (rOT-bNP) transgene was not expressed in either line. Immunohistochemistry and radioimmunoassay showed hGH protein in the hypothalamus from where it was transported in varicose fibres via the median eminence to the posterior pituitary gland. Immunogold electron microscopy showed hGH co-stored with VP-NP in the same granules. The VP-hGH transgene did not affect water balance, VP storage or release in vivo. Drinking 2 % saline for 72 h increased hypothalamic transgene hGH mRNA expression, and depleted posterior pituitary hGH and VP stores in parallel. In anaesthetised, water-loaded JP 17 rats, hGH was released with VP {{in response to an}} acute hypovolumic stimulus (sodium nitrosopentacyano, 400 microg I. V.). JP 17 rats had a reduced growth rate, lower anterior pituitary rGH contents, and a reduced amplitude of endogenous pulsatile rGH secretion assessed by automated <b>blood</b> <b>microsampling</b> in conscious rats, consistent with a short-loop feedback of the VP-hGH on the endogenous GH axis. This transgenic rat model enables us to study physiological regulation of hypothalamic transgene protein production, transport and secretion, as well as its effects on other neuroendocrine systems in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Background: At {{the start}} of their work, the European Bioanalysis Forum dried <b>blood</b> spots <b>microsampling</b> {{consortium}} did not form a dedicated team to investigate the spot homogeneity. However, two teams performed experiments that produced results relating to sample homogeneity. Results: The data, which were produced via two different approaches (a radiolabeled and a nonradiolabeled approach), are highly complementary and demonstrate clear effects on sample inhomogeneity due to the substrate type, compound and hematocrit levels. Conclusion: The results demonstrate that sample inhomogeneity is a significant hurdle {{to the use of}} dried blood spots for regulated bioanalysis that should be investigated further in the method establishment phase if the whole spot is not sampled. © 2013 Future Science Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Solid {{dispersion}} formulations made of itraconazole (ITZ) and Soluplus® (polyethylene glycol, {{polyvinyl acetate}} and polyvinylcaprolactame-based graft copolymer abbreviated SOL) were produced using hot melt extrusion. Since ITZ possesses a water solubility {{of less than}} 1 ng/mL, {{the aim of this}} work was to enhance the aqueous solubility of ITZ, and thereby improve its bioavailability. The three formulations consisted of a simple SOL/ITZ amorphous solid dispersion (ASD), an optimized SOL/ITZ/AcDiSol® (super-disintegrant) ASD and an equimolar inclusion complex of ITZ in hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin (substitution degree = 0. 63, CD) with SOL. The three formulations were compared in vitro and in vivo to the marketed product Sporanox®. The in vitro enhancement of dissolution rate was evaluated using a biphasic dissolution test. In vitro dissolution results showed that all three formulations had a higher percentage of ITZ released than Sporanox® with the following ranking: SOL/ITZ/CD > SOL/ITZ/AcDiSol® > SOL/ITZ > Sporanox®. The bioavailability of these four formulations was evaluated in rats. The bioanalytical method was optimized so that only 10 μL of blood was withdrawn from the rats using specific volumetric absorptive <b>microsampling</b> <b>devices.</b> This enabled to keep the same rats during the whole study, which was in accordance with the Three Rs rules (reduction, refinement and replacement). Furthermore, this technique allowed the suppression of inter-individual variability. Higher Cmax and AUC were obtained after the administration of all three formulations compared to the levels after the use of Sporanox® as follows: SOL/ITZ/AcDiSol® > SOL/ITZ/CD > SOL/ITZ > Sporanox®. The inversion in the ranking between SOL/ITZ/CD and SOL/ITZ/AcDiSol® made impossible the establishment of an in vitro–vivo correlation. Indeed, very different release rates were obtained in vitro and in vivo for the two optimized formulations. These results suggest that ITZ would be protected inside the core of the SOL micelles even during the absorption step at the intestine, while some agents present in the intestinal fluids could displace ITZ from the hydrophobic cavity of CD by competition.
