5|$|It is, I believe, universally {{agreed that}} the only way to keep Indians from harassing the country is to visit them. But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. I <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E
5|$|The {{question}} of supply—let me {{deal with it}} this way. I generally <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> a government is elected to power in the lower House and has the numbers and can maintain the numbers in the lower House, it is entitled to expect that it will govern for the three-year term unless quite extraordinary events intervene... Having said that... if we do make up our minds at some stage that the Government is so reprehensible that an Opposition must use whatever power is available to it, then I'd {{want to find a}} situation in which Mr. Whitlam woke up one morning finding the decision had been made and finding that he had been caught with his pants well and truly down.|$|E
25|$|There are {{numerous}} possible etymologies {{for the name}} Metatron. However, some scholars, such as Philip Alexander, <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> the name Metatron originated in Hekhalot-Merkabah texts (such as 3 Enoch), then {{it may be a}} magic word like Adiriron and Dapdapiron.|$|E

Some say the {{appearance}} of an aye-aye in a village predicts {{the death of a}} villager, {{and the only way to}} prevent this is to kill it. The Sakalava people go so far as to claim aye-ayes sneak into houses through the thatched roofs and murder the sleeping occupants by using their middle finger to puncture the victim's aorta.|$|E
500|$|Looking back on {{the tour}} as a whole, and in {{combination}} with the preceding Magic Tour, Billboard magazine cover story stated that [...] "Even for an artist who has largely built his career on epic shows, Springsteen and the E Streeters have managed to find yet another gear at this stage in their legendary career." [...] Springsteen himself said, [...] "With the end of these shows, we're coming {{to the end of a}} decade-long project that really was a tremendous renewal of the power, the strength and the service that our band hopefully provides." [...] Springsteen also touted the quality of the shows: [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> you come and see us now you're seeing the best E Street Band that's ever played." [...] Specific shows from the tour were named as among the best concerts of 2009 by Spin magazine, The Philadelphia Inquirer, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the Chicago Tribune.|$|E
500|$|Early on, Young {{established}} himself {{as one of the}} harder-throwing pitchers in the game. Bill James wrote that Zimmer often put a piece of beefsteak inside his baseball glove to protect his catching hand from Young's fastball. In the absence of radar guns, however, it is impossible to say just how hard Young actually threw. Young continued to perform at a high level during the 1890 season. On {{the last day of the}} season, Young won both games of a doubleheader. In the first weeks of Young's career, Cap Anson, the player-manager of the Chicago Colts spotted Young's ability. Anson told Spiders' manager Gus Schmelz, [...] "He's too green to do your club much good, but I <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> I taught him what I know, I might make a pitcher out of him in a couple of years. He's not worth it now, but I'm willing to give you $1,000 ($ today) for him." [...] Schmelz replied, [...] "Cap, you can keep your thousand and we'll keep the rube." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1774, the First Continental Congress was {{convened in}} {{response}} to the passage of the Intolerable Acts. Adams agreed to attend, despite an emotional plea from his friend Jonathan Sewall to do otherwise. At the Congress, Adams renewed his push for the right to a jury trial, stating [...] "Representative government and trial by jury are the heart and lungs of liberty. Without them, we have no other fortification against being ridden like horses, fleeced like sheep, worked like cattle, and fed and clothed like swines and hounds.” Adams did not generally like the other delegates to the Congress. He complained of what he considered to be their pretentiousness, writing to Abigail, [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> it was moved and seconded that We should come to a Resolution that Three and two make five We should be entertained with Logick and Rhetorick, Law, History, Politicks and Mathematicks, concerning the Subject for two whole Days, and then We should pass the Resolution unanimously in the Affirmative." [...] The Congress disbanded in October after sending a letter of grievances to King George III.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the Democrats had {{assembled}} in Chicago on July 8, 1884 to begin their convention, the Republicans had already picked their nominee: James G. Blaine of Maine. [...] Blaine's nomination turned many reform-minded Republicans (known as Mugwumps) away from their party. [...] Bayard and Cleveland, seen as honest politicians, were the Democrats most favored by the renegade Republican faction. [...] Bayard was optimistic {{at the start of}} the convention, but the results of the first ballot ran heavily against him: 170 votes to Cleveland's 392. [...] The reason was the same as in 1880: as Congressman Robert S. Stevens of New York said, [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> he were President his Administration would be one in which every American citizen would take pride. I believe he is a patriot, but it would be a suicidal attempt to nominate him. His [...] Dover speech would be sent into every household in the North." [...] The voting the next day demonstrated the point, as Cleveland was nominated on the second ballot.|$|E
500|$|One {{method was}} by {{introducing}} overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as [...] "The Pattern" [...] in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot {{over the course}} of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias. [...] A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production. [...] Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create [...] "clearly defined goalposts" [...] (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that [...] "There are certain details that are hugely important that I <b>believe,</b> <b>if</b> shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air." [...] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from [...] "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that [...] "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Qur'anic verses are {{numerous}} that praise the Companions and criticize the hypocrites, {{both as a}} group and specific individuals from amongst them–as well as criticism of specific individuals other than the hypocrites. The most well-known of these is a verse of the Quran stating, [...] "O you who <b>believe,</b> <b>if</b> a wrongdoer should approach you conveying information, then verify that {{so as not to}} fall into ignorance thus regretting what you have done." [...] While this verse was revealed regarding a particular individual, it is a general principle. Following this example, were the Prophet and then His Companions.|$|E

[...] In the report published by the Fridtjof Nansen Institute in 2008, Norwegian researcher Bendik Solum Whist noted that Nord Stream AG was incorporated in Switzerland, [...] "whose strict banking secrecy laws makes the project less transparent {{than it would have been}} if based within the EU". [...] Secondly, the Russian energy sector [...] "in general lacks transparency" [...] and Gazprom [...] "is no exception".|$|E

On 21 May 2013, May voted in favour of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which legalised same-sex marriage in England and Wales.|$|E

2500|$|Military forces {{increasingly}} {{joined the}} opposition, and Nasheed resigned that day. His statement read: [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> I continue as the President of the Maldives, {{the people of}} the country would suffer more. I therefore have resigned as the President of Maldives. I wish the Maldives would have a consolidated democracy. I wish for justice to be established. My wish is for the progress and prosperity of the people. And I thank you all for your support and contributions to achieve success for the past three years." [...] He also stated his hope that his resignation might avoid international pressure on the Maldives over the unrest. Vice President Mohammed Waheed Hassan, who claims to have opposed Abdulla Mohamed's arrest, was then sworn in as the new president, and a warrant was issued for Nasheed's arrest.|$|E
2500|$|Like Walter Scott and Landor, Southey {{connects the}} events {{surrounding}} Napoleon with the Moors' invasion of Spain within his work. In a letter to Landor, Southey described the rape scene: [...] "here you have {{a part of the}} poem so difficult to get over even tolerably that I verily <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> I had at first thought of making Roderick any thing more than a sincere penitent this difficulty would have deterred me from attempting the subject." [...] To overcome the problem with having his main character rape a woman, Southey decided to put some of the responsibility on Florinda and make Roderick more sympathetic. It is also possible that there are autobiographical elements to the scene, especially with Roderick's problematic marriage to a woman he did not love as possibly describing the events of his friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge's life and his love for Sara Hutchinson. This would allow Southey to deal with events from his life in a poetic form.|$|E
2500|$|World War II shocked {{her into}} a more {{conventional}} belief: [...] "I <b>believe</b> <b>if</b> {{people are looking for}} the truth, the truth of the Christian religion will come out and meet them." [...] And in the early 1950s, she thought she had a mystical revelation in France and actively tried to convert to Catholicism. There was a precedent in her family for this action, as her sister, Letitia, had earlier converted to Catholicism, thereby causing quite a stir. But West's attempt was short-lived, and she confessed to a friend: [...] "I could not go on with being a Catholic... I don't want, I can't bear to, become a Graham Greene and Evelyn Waugh, and I cannot believe that I am required to pay such a price for salvation." [...] Her writings of the 1960s and early 1970s again betray a profound mistrust towards God: [...] "The case against religion is the responsibility of God for the sufferings of mankind, which makes it impossible to believe the good things said about Him in the Bible, and consequently to believe anything it says about Him." ...|$|E
