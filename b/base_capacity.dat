Data {{used in the study}} were obtained from the sugar firms, publications of the Central Bank of Nigeria and National Bureau of Statistics. Augmented Dicker Fuller unit root test was conducted on the specified data to ascertain their stationarity and order of integration. The result reveals that some variables were stationary at level while some were stationary at first difference. The diagnostic statistics from the multiple log linear regression on the specified variables confirmed the reliability of the model. The empirical result reveals that sugar cane price and sugar industry’s real energy consumption have significant negative relationship with the technology <b>based</b> <b>capacity</b> utilization in the sugar industry in Nigeria. On the other hand, the wage rate of skill workers, industry’s, real research expenditure, human capital and period of import substitution have significant positive influenced on the technology <b>based</b> <b>capacity</b> utilization rate in the industry.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a {{general theory of}} sequential irreversible investments in capital where a firm has the option to expand its current capacity or just wait for better time. Facing economic uncertainty, the firm has an operating function of the current capacity and an exogenous stochastic factor modelled by semimartingale. This general model encompasses all previously studied models, including the deterministic case {{as well as the}} stochastic case with Geometric Brownian motions, Lévy processes and even with regime shift. In this paper, general existence and uniqueness results are first provided for irreversible investments with finite and infinite horizon, respectively. As the main contribution of this paper, a new method is proposed to characterize the optimal investment policy, the <b>base</b> <b>capacity</b> policy. Under the policy, the capacity is kept always at or above the <b>base</b> <b>capacity</b> which is characterized by a stochastic backward equation. This new method gives a number of new qualitative insights into the nature of the irreversible investment. It is demonstrated that the optimal policy equals the marginal operating profit and the user cost of capital in those free intervals when the irreversibility constraint does not bind. While, the equality holds true only on average in block intervals when no investment occurs. Besides, this method easily leads to some general comparative statics results: When the operating profit function is supermodular, the <b>base</b> <b>capacity</b> increases monotonically with the exogenous shock; and the firm size always declines with the user cost of capital. Finally, explicit solutions are derived when the exogenous economic shocks are modelled by Lévy processes and the operating profit function is of Cobb–Douglas style...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a {{general theory of}} irreversible investment of a single firm that chooses a dynamic capacity expansion plan in an uncertain environment. The model is set up free of any distributional or any parametric assumptions and hence encompasses all the existing models. As the first contribution, a general existence and uniqueness result is provided for the optimal investment policy. Based upon an alternative approach developed previously to dynamic programming problems, we derive the optimal <b>base</b> <b>capacity</b> policy such that the firm always keeps the capacity {{at or above the}} <b>base</b> <b>capacity.</b> The critical <b>base</b> <b>capacity</b> is explicitly constructed and characterized via a stochastic backward equation. This method allows qualitative insights into the nature of the optimal investment under irreversibility. (It is demonstrated that the marginal profit is indeed equal to the user cost of capital in free intervals where investment occurs in an absolutely continuous way at strictly positive rates. However, the equality is maintained only in expectation on average in blocked intervals where no investment occurs. Whenever the uncertainty is generated by a diffusion, the investment is singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. In contrast to the deterministic and Brownian motion case where lump sum investment takes place only at time zero, the firm responses in general more frequently in jumps to shocks. Nevertheless, lump sum investments are shown to be possible only at information surprises which is defined as unpredictable stopping time or unanticipated information jump even at the predictable time.) Furthermore, general monotone comparative statics results are derived for the relevant ingredients of the model. Finally, explicit solutions are derived for infinite time horizon, a separable operating profit function of Cobb?Douglas type and an exponential L 4 evy process modelled economic shock...|$|E

We model the production capacity as an Ito diffusion controlled by a nondecreasing process representing the cumulative investment.

We derive some first order conditions for optimality and we characterize the optimal solution {{in terms of the}} <b>base</b> <b>capacity</b> process, i. e. the unique solution of a representation problem in the spirit of Bank and El Karoui (2004).

This is a novelty in the literature on finite horizon singular stochastic control problems.

This study incorporates the pushover and response history analysis to examine how varying steel yield strength (Fy), 28 day nominal compressive concrete strength (f’c), modes, and ground motions may affect the <b>base</b> shear <b>capacity</b> and displacements of a reinforced concrete structure. Different steel and concrete strengths {{were found to have}} minimal impact on the initial stiffness of the structure.

The <b>base</b> shear <b>capacity</b> geometric median increased as f’c or Fy increased, and the <b>base</b> shear <b>capacity</b> dispersion measure decreased as f’c or Fy increased.

This displays the robustness of both analysis methods because material properties have insignificant impact on seismic response.
