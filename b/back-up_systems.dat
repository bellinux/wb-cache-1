2500|$|Interstellar {{features}} three spacecraft: the Ranger, the Endurance, and the Lander. The Ranger's {{function is}} similar to the Space Shuttle's, being able to enter and exit planetary atmospheres. The Endurance, the crew's mother ship, has a circular structure formed by 12 capsules: four with planetary colonization equipment, four with engines, and four with the permanent functions of cockpit, medical labs and habitation. Production designer Nathan Crowley said the Endurance was based on the International Space Station: [...] "It's a real mish-mash of different kinds of technology.

25|$|The {{principal}} {{advantage of}} CSP {{is the ability}} to efficiently add thermal storage, allowing the dispatching of electricity over up to a 24-hour period. Since peak electricity demand typically occurs at about 5pm, many CSP power plants use 3 to 5hours of thermal storage. With current technology, storage of heat is much cheaper and more efficient than storage of electricity. In this way, the CSP plant can produce electricity day and night. If the CSP site has predictable solar radiation, then the CSP plant becomes a reliable power plant. Reliability can further be improved by installing a <b>back-up</b> combustion <b>system.</b> The <b>back-up</b> <b>system</b> can use most of the CSP plant, which decreases the cost of the <b>back-up</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

50|$|Tunnel boring {{machines}} (TBMs) and associated <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> {{are used to}} highly automate the entire tunnelling process, reducing tunnelling costs. In certain predominantly urban applications, tunnel boring is viewed as quick and cost effective alternative to laying surface rails and roads. Expensive compulsory purchase of buildings and land, with potentially lengthy planning inquiries, is eliminated. Disadvantages of TBMs arise from their usually large size - the difficulty of transporting the large TBM {{to the site of}} tunnel construction, or (alternatively) the high cost of assembling the TBM on-site, often {{within the confines of the}} tunnel being constructed.|$|E

50|$|Closed {{livestock}} carriers - {{in which}} more or less all of the animals pens are located within the holds and internal decks of the ship. This {{has the advantage of}} providing a more controlled environment in which the animals and their feeding and watering arrangements are sheltered from adverse weather. However, ventilation is almost entirely dependent on mechanical systems and construction rules require specific ventilation standards for the internal spaces. These usually stipulate the minimum number of air changes per hour. Regulations also require <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> and auxiliary power arrangements which are separate from the main engine room. This is to ensure that adequate ventilation, lighting, watering and feeding can be maintained for the animals in the event of fire or machinery failure in the main engine spaces.|$|E

40|$|Path {{integration}} {{has long}} been thought of as an obligatory process that automatically updates one’s position and orientation during navigation. This {{has led to the}} hypotheses that path integration serves as a <b>back-up</b> <b>system</b> in case landmark navigation fails, and a reference system that detects discrepant landmarks. Three experiments tested these hypotheses in humans, using a homing task with a catch-trial paradigm. Contrary to the <b>back-up</b> <b>system</b> hypothesis, when stable landmarks unexpectedly disappeared on catch trials, participants were completely disoriented, and only then began to rely on path integration in subsequent trials (Experiment 1). Contrary to the reference system hypothesis, when stable landmarks unexpectedly shifted by 115 ° on catch trials, participants failed to detect the shift and were completely captured by the landmarks (Experiment 2). Conversely, when chronically unstable landmarks unexpectedly remained in place on catch trials, participants failed to notice and continued to navigate by path integration (Experiment 3). In the latter two cases, they gradually sensed the instability (or stability) of landmarks on later catch trials. These results demonstrate that path integration does not automatically serve as a <b>back-up</b> <b>system,</b> and does not function as a reference system on individual sorties, although it may contribute to monitoring environmental stability over time. Rather than being automatic, the roles of path integration and landmark navigation are thus dynamically modulated by the environmental context...|$|R
5000|$|On 23 December 2008, {{the wheel}} stopped and trapped 173 {{passengers}} {{for about six}} hours. The breakdown {{was caused by a}} short circuit and fire in the Flyer's wheel control room, which cut off the air-conditioning in the wheel. Eleven passengers were evacuated via a sling-like device from a few of the capsules, and those stranded were given food and drink. The wheel restarted nearly seven hours after it had stopped and two people were hospitalized. The Flyer was closed indefinitely and an investigation into the cause of the malfunction was launched. [...] The wheel re-opened on 26 January 2009 after the Singapore Police received the final safety certification report from the Conformity Assessment Board. Following this breakdown, additional <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> costing about $3 million were installed.

50|$|The BP {{wellhead}} {{had been}} {{fitted with a}} blowout preventer (BOP), {{but it was not}} fitted with remote-control or acoustically activated triggers for use {{in case of an emergency}} requiring a platform to be evacuated.

Documents discussed during congressional hearings June 17, 2010 indicated that Transocean previously made modifications to the BOP for the Macondo site which increased the risk of BOP failure, in spite of warnings from their contractor to that effect. Regulators in both Norway and Brazil generally require acoustically activated triggers on all offshore platforms, but when the Minerals Management Service considered requiring the remote device, a report commissioned by the agency as well as drilling companies questioned its cost and effectiveness. In 2003, the agency determined that the device would not be required because drilling rigs had other <b>back-up</b> <b>systems</b> to cut off a well.|$|E

Active surge control is a promising method for extending the compressor map towards and into the unstable area at low mass flow by stabilizing the surge phenomenon.

However, a failure in the active surge control system may endanger the compressor by entering deep surge as the compressor is allowed {{to operate in the}} stabilized surge area. We propose the use of a <b>back-up</b> <b>system</b> applied to the active system to keep the compressor safe should the active system fail. This paper present an active compressor surge control system with piston actuation combined with a blow off <b>system</b> as the <b>back-up.</b> Performance of the combined system is evaluated by simulating the system in situations where the piston is saturated or jammed.
