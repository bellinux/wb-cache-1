5000|$|The {{physical}} and functional {{separation of the}} inner cell mass from the trophectoderm (TE) is a special feature of mammalian development and is the first cell lineage specification in these embryos. Following fertilization in the oviduct, the mammalian embryo undergoes a relatively slow round of cleavages to produce an eight cell morula. Each cell of the morula, called a blastomere, increases surface contact with its neighbors in a process called compaction. This results in a polarization of the cells within the morula, and further cleavage yields a blastocyst of roughly 32 cells.

The company was founded to enhance and commercialize university-based inventions and the company had exclusive licenses to patent or sell all inventions from 12 major universities and non-exclusives with 71. Perhaps the most successful company founded based on licensing alone was Applied Bioscience, one of the biggest successes in the biotech industry. University Genetics - UGEN - was virtually financed with $60,000 of equity and a $2.3 million R&D partnership. In 1983 the company went public (symbol UGEN) and in 1986 completed a secondary offering in which the original investors were bought out for $3.6 million, giving them a 60X return on investment in 5 years. The company’s strategy evolved into funding start-up companies in incubators and exit either through sale or IPO. Chief operating divisions were Applied Animal Genetics, which was in the business of implementing and exporting superior <b>bovine</b> <b>embryos,</b> and Applied Plant Genetics whose principal business was cloning rare miniature plants.

We attempted GLIS 1 downregulation of bovine early embryos by RNA interference and evaluated developmental competency and gene transcripts, which are involved in zygotic gene activation (ZGA) in GLIS 1 -downregulated embryos.

A microfluidic chip with the built-in amperometric detector array was successfully constructed to transport, immobilize, and in situ measure a single <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> for the evaluation of oxygen consumption characteristics. The rnicrofluidic chip consisted of a poly(dimethylsiloxane) slab containing a size-limited transportation microchannel and a glass substrate with a 4 -working-electrode amperometric detector array located on the bottom of a groove. A single embryo could be transported along the groove and be safely immobilized at the gate position of the microchannel due to the size limitation by using the flow rate of 10 mu 1 /min. Subsequently, the oxygen consumption characteristics of the embryo were in situ measured with the amperometric detector array. The average value of oxygen concentration difference (Delta C) between the bulk solution and the Day- 6 embryo surface based on the analysis of spherical diffusion theory was 2. 80 0. 72 mu M at room temperature. Moreover, the correlation coefficient of more than 0. 92 indicates that the spherical diffusion theory could be suitable for depicting the oxygen consumption layer of an embryo at the morula stage in the microchannel. The success of the presently used microfluidic chip not only greatly simplifies the expensive instrument requirements such as scanning electrochemical microscope and stereo-positioning manipulator but also makes the transportation, immobilization, and {{detection of}} a single embryo feasible within a microchip.

At the same time, DNA methylation level of satellite DNA and pluripotency gene promoters increased significantly. Real-time PCR analysis results indicated that the transcription levels of NANOG and OCT- 4 decreased in the DMOG-treated group. Furthermore, TET inhibition negatively affected blastocyst formation, resulting in a decline in the blastocyst rate (17. 1 ± 1. 3 % vs 24. 1 ± 0. 6 %); however, the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly increased according to the results of a TUNEL assay. Additionally, expression levels of the apoptosis-related gene BAX were up-regulated, while the expression of BCL- 2 was down-regulated.

The study is then extended to consider the biological cell in which modes are definitively sustained without artificial assistance. The properties of resonators and their emitted energy spectra are studied within the general framework of the Finite Difference Time Domain method, requiring supercomputing resources to probe the transient behaviour and interactions among the electromagnetic fields. The formal theory of Mie scattering is also extended to develop a cutting-edge, computationally efficient model for general, multilayer microspheres, which represents a valuable achievement for the scientific community in its own right. The model unifies the approaches {{in the field of}} mathematical modelling to express the energy spectrum in a single encompassing equation, which is then applied in a range of contexts. The gulf between modelling and biological resonators is bridged by an in-depth study of the physical characteristics of a range of biological cells, and the selection criteria for viable resonator candidates are developed through a number of detailed feasibility studies. The <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> is consequently selected as the optimal choice for this investigation. Evidence is established for the ability of a <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> to sustain whispering gallery modes. The ability of a cell to sustain modes on its own represents a conceptually elegant paradigm for new technologies involving on-site cell interrogation and reporting of the status and health of a biological cell in the future. The methodological and technological developments contained herein thus become a vital asset for the future realisation of autonomous biological cell sensors.

40|$|Mice {{and cattle}} use {{distinct}} pathways {{for the first}} cell segregation into inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE) lineages at the blastocyst stage. However, limited knowledge is available regarding reliable transcriptional networks that orchestrate complex developmental processes {{at this stage in}} nonrodent species. In order to elucidate the site-dominant transcriptomic properties of bovine blastocysts, we separated cell samples into the ICM and TE using both mechanical and chemical methods and performed in silico prescreening for candidate genes that were site-dominantly expressed in bovine blastocysts. We further performed quantitative RT-PCR and in situ hybridization using the site-specific cell samples. As a result, we identified 7 ICM-dominant genes and 5 TE-dominant genes not yet found in earlier studies. Our findings provide novel insights into the mechanism of cell-fate specification in the preimplantation <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo...</b>|$|R

They developed assisted reproduction techniques (IVM, IVF, vitrification, embryo culture, ES cell) and established a <b>bovine</b> <b>embryo</b> mass production system as the leader of a National Project in Japan in 1990. He obtained the first calves after oocyte vitrification, IVF, in-vitro culture and blastocyst transfer in 1992. He moved to human IVF in 1999, developed the Cryotop vitrification method for human oocytes and established the first human oocyte bank in 2001. The first babies following oocyte vitrification in USA and Japan were obtained by his group using the Cryotop method. He is also interested in rejuvenescence of old defective oocytes, and obtained the first calf from old infertile cattle with germinal vesicle transfer in 2002...|$|R
