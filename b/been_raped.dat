Other victims Altaf meets are shown committing suicide or having lost their minds.|$|E

5|$|After several months, Noriega was {{transferred}} to the province of Chiriquí, where Torrijos and Díaz Herrera were posted. That year's presidential election was contested by Arnulfo Arias, a native of that province. The sitting President, Rodolfo Chiari, ordered Torrijos to harass Arias's party members, to weaken his election bid. Torrijos passed this task on to Noriega, whose men arrested a number of people. Several prisoners said that they had been tortured; others stated they had <b>been</b> <b>raped</b> in prison. The brutality of Noriega's activities led to him being suspended for ten days, an item of information that was picked up by the U.S. intelligence services.|$|E

5|$|Julia {{had started}} {{going out to}} dance halls in 1942, and met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling Julia that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. Julia took his advice, and often gave her young son a piece of chocolate or sugar pastry the next morning for breakfast that she had been given the night before. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had <b>been</b> <b>raped</b> by an unknown soldier.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, the {{military}} rulers in Burma undertook renovation {{work on the}} Mahamuni Pagoda. During this period, the Mahamuni Buddha image was damaged in 1997 when a hole appeared {{in the belly of}} the Great Image. It was believed that thieves had drilled the hole in an attempt to steal jewels believed to be secreted within the image. It was reported that a military officer had requested to open the temple in the night, resulting in a meeting of all the senior monks from major monasteries in the area to discuss the matter. Whilst the meeting was in progress, attention was diverted to a purported rape incident committed by a Muslim man on a Buddhist girl. A major riot broke out but it turned out afterward that the Buddhist girl had not <b>been</b> <b>raped</b> at all. It was a coverup to divert attention away from the Buddha so it could be repaired. However, the mystery remains as to whether any jewellery did exist and was actually removed from the Great Image at all.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{evidence}} linking experiences of sexual abuse in childhood or adolescence with patterns of victimization during adulthood. A national study of violence against women in the United States {{found that women who}} <b>were</b> <b>raped</b> before the age of 18 years were twice as likely to <b>be</b> <b>raped</b> as adults, compared with those who <b>were</b> not <b>raped</b> as children or adolescents (18.3% and 8.7%, respectively).|$|R

5|$|The Red Army {{initiated}} {{an offensive}} into East Prussia in October 1944, {{but it was}} temporarily driven back two weeks later. After that, the German Ministry of Propaganda reported that war crimes {{had taken place in}} East Prussian villages, in particular in Nemmersdorf, where inhabitants had <b>been</b> <b>raped</b> and killed by the advancing Soviets. Since the Nazi war effort had largely stripped the civil population of able-bodied men for service in the military, the victims of the atrocity were primarily old men, women, and children. Upon the Soviet withdrawal from the area, German authorities sent in film crews to document what had happened, and invited foreign observers as further witnesses. A documentary film from the footage obtained during this effort was put together and shown in cinemas in East Prussia, with the intention of fanaticising civilian and military resolve in resisting the Soviets. A Nazi information campaign about the atrocities at Nemmersdorf, as well as other crimes committed in East Prussia, convinced the remaining civilians that they should not get caught by the advancing enemy.|$|E
5|$|The riots {{took place}} {{several days after}} a violent {{incident}} in Shaoguan, Guangdong, where many migrant workers are employed {{as part of a}} programme to alleviate labour shortages. According to state media, a disgruntled former worker disseminated rumours in late June that two Han women had <b>been</b> <b>raped</b> by six Uyghur men. Official sources later said they found no evidence to support the rape allegation. Overnight on 25–26 June, tensions at the Guangdong factory led to a full-blown ethnic brawl between Uyghurs and Hans, during which two Uyghur co-workers were killed. Exiled Uyghur leaders alleged the death toll was much higher. While the official Xinhua News Agency reported that the person responsible for spreading the rumours had been arrested, Uyghurs alleged that the authorities had failed to protect the Uyghur workers, or to arrest any of the Han people involved in the killings. They organised a street protest in Ürümqi on 5 July to voice their discontent and to demand a full government investigation.|$|E
5|$|During 1942–1943, Julia {{lived with}} her son at The Dairy Cottage, 120aAllerton Road, Woolton. The cottage was owned by Mimi's husband, and Mimi wanted Julia to live there because they would be closer to her house and also out of the Stanley house. As Alf was often away at sea, Julia started going out to dance halls. In 1942, she met a Welsh soldier named 'Taffy' Williams who was {{stationed}} in the barracks at Mossley Hill. Alf later blamed himself for this, as he had written letters telling her that {{because there was a}} war on, she should go out and enjoy herself. After an evening out, she would often give her young son a piece of chocolate or shortcrust pastry the next morning for breakfast. She became pregnant by Williams in late 1944, though first claiming that she had <b>been</b> <b>raped</b> by an unknown soldier. Williams refused to live with Julia— who was still married to Alf— until she gave up John, which she refused to do. When Alf eventually came home in 1944, he offered to look after his wife, their son, and the expected baby, but she rejected the idea.|$|E
