40|$|The {{endophytic}} fungus Berkleasmium sp. Dzf 12, {{isolated from}} Dioscorea zingiberensis, {{was found to}} produce palmarumycins C 12 and C 13 which possess {{a great variety of}} biological activities. Seven biocompatible water-immiscible organic solvents including n-dodecane, n-hexadecane, 1 -hexadecene, liquid paraffin, dibutyl phthalate, <b>butyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and oleic acid were evaluated to improve palmarumycins C 12 and C 13 production in suspension culture of Berkleasmium sp. Dzf 12. Among the chosen solvents both <b>butyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and liquid paraffin were the most effective to improve palmarumycins C 12 and C 13 production. The addition of dibutyl phthalate, <b>butyl</b> <b>oleate</b> and oleic acid to the cultures of Berkleasmium sp. Dzf 12 significantly enhanced palmarumycin C 12 production by adsorbing palmarumycin C 12 into the organic phase. When <b>butyl</b> <b>oleate</b> was fed at 5 % (v/v) in medium at the beginning of fermentation (day 0), the highest palmarumycin C 12 yield (191. 6 mg/L) was achieved, about a 34. 87 -fold increase in comparison with the control (5. 3 mg/L). n-Dodecane, 1 -hexadecene and liquid paraffin had a great influence on the production of palmarumycin C 13. When liquid paraffin was added at 10 % (v/v) in medium on day 3 of fermentation, the palmarumycin C 13 yield reached a maximum value (134. 1 mg/L), which was 4. 35 -fold that of the control (30. 8 mg/L). Application of the aqueous-organic solvent system should be a simple and efficient process strategy for enhancing palmarumycin C 12 and C 13 production in liquid cultures of the endophytic fungus Berkleasmium sp.

In {{the development of the}} palm oil industry, the necessary diversification of oil palm products needed by using the esterification reaction. One of the products of the oil palm which on development now is a fatty acid alkyl esters. Products that include the type of fatty acid alkyl ester is plasticizer. In this study, the plasticizer is synthesized by esterification of oleic acid and butanol, using activated natural zeolite catalysts. This research aims to study the influence of H-Zeolite catalyst composition and stirring speed on synthesis plasticizer <b>butyl</b> <b>oleate,</b> and determining the characteristics of the plasticizer <b>butyl</b> <b>oleate</b> which generated through analysis of test products. The process is using the variation of H-Zeolite catalyst composition (12. 5 %, 15 %, 17. 5 %) based on oleic acid and stirring speed (175 rpm, 200 rpm, 225 rpm), with a fixed variable, the reaction temperature of 1100 C, the process time is 6 hours and the reaction molar ratio of 1 : 9. From the analysis of the results showed that the esterification of H-Zeolite catalyst composition and stirring speed affects the conversion of the resulting products.
