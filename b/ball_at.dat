5|$|Capturing Pokémon {{is another}} {{essential}} element of the gameplay. During a battle with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké <b>Ball</b> <b>at</b> it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the ownership of the player. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon {{and the type of}} Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture.|$|E

5|$|Forster was, however, criticised in {{the early}} part of his time at Celtic for lacking {{confidence}} and command, and uncertain when he had the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> his feet. In time he matured, with his confidence and kicking noticeably improved. His level of concentration was also noted; given Celtic's dominance over the majority of their opponents in Scotland, their goalkeeper often has long periods of inactivity, but when eventually called into action Forster was invariably alert and ready.|$|E
5|$|In Week 6 of {{his rookie}} season, Meskó set a season-long {{record with a}} 65-yard punt in {{overtime}} that gave the Baltimore Ravens the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their own 19-yard line.

5|$|In week ten, the Bulldogs {{played the}} Pros {{for the second}} time in the season. In the first quarter, a fumbled punt by the Bulldogs gave the Pros the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their 32-yard line.

The Bulldogs lost 7–0 in the first professional game played on Thanksgiving Day, which launched a yearly tradition.|$|E

On third down, Tech {{committed}} a 10-yard penalty, negating {{what would have been}} a first-down run.

5|$|Texas got the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their 20 {{to start}} the second half. On the first play from scrimmage, Jamaal Charles rushed for threeyards. On second down, Vince Young's pass was intercepted by Nate Salley at the UT37. Two rushes by Antonio Pittman {{resulted}} in a first down at the UT 30. After a short gain on first down and an incomplete pass on second down, Troy Smith recovered his own fumble on third down {{to set up a}} successful 44-yard field goal by Huston. Texas used six plays, including a 63-yard pass to Billy Pittman before being stopped at the Ohio State eightyard-line. David Pino made the 25-yard field goal. On the ensuing kick-off by Richmond McGee, OSU's Ted Ginn, Jr. took the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> the oneyard-line and ran it out to almost mid-field. The drive ended with a successful 26-yard field goal by Huston. The following three possessions (two for Texas and one for Ohio State) resulted in punts.

5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a dependable lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E

5|$|According to MCC {{guidelines}} for umpires, factors {{to consider when}} giving an lbw decision include the angle at which the ball was travelling and whether the ball was swinging through the air. He must also account for {{the height of the}} <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> impact and how far from the wicket the batsman was standing; from this information he must determine if the ball would have passed over the stumps or struck them. The MCC guidance states that it is easier to make a decision when the ball strikes the batsman without pitching, but that the difficulty increases when the ball has bounced and more so when there is a shorter time between the ball pitching and striking the batsman.|$|E
5|$|After the turnover, Florida State {{received}} the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> its 32-yard {{line with a}} 2017 lead and 12:08 remaining in the game. On the first play after the turnover, Rix completed a 51-yard pass to Walker for a first down at the Tech 18-yard line. The three plays that followed netted only three yards, and Beitia was sent into the game to attempt a 35-yard field goal.

5|$|Appalachian State {{continued}} their drive but {{were forced to}} punt after being stopped on 3rd down. Michigan began their drive at the Appalachian State 34-yard line, but a Henne pass was intercepted by Mountaineer defender Leonard Love on the fourth play of the drive. Love returned the ball 26-yards, and Appalachian State began the drive at their own 41-yard line, but were forced to punt after going three-and-out. Michigan got the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> their own 24-yard line and mounted a nine-play, 43-yard drive to the Appalachian State 33-yard line. On the final play, a fourth and five, Henne's pass fell incomplete, turning the ball over to Appalachian State, who were again quickly forced to punt. After returning the punt to their own 46-yard line, Hart ran the ball 54yards for a touchdown, giving Michigan the lead 32–31 with 4:36 left. Michigan chose to go for two, but the conversion attempt failed. Edwards was picked off on the first play of the ensuing drive, giving Michigan control of the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> the Appalachian State 43-yard line. Michigan ran five plays before attempting a 43-yard field goal. The attempt was blocked, however, giving Appalachian State control of the ball with 1:37 left. With no timeouts left, the Mountaineers drove 69yards down the field in just over a minute in game time, setting up a Rauch field goal from 24yards out with 26seconds left. The attempt was good, giving Appalachian State a 34–32 lead. Michigan regained control of {{the ball on the}} ensuing kickoff, and a 46-yard pass from Henne to Mario Manningham gave the Wolverines a 37-yard field goal attempt with six seconds left on the clock. The attempt was blocked by Corey Lynch, securing a 34–32 win by the Mountaineers.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the second quarter, Tennessee had the <b>ball</b> <b>at</b> its 19-yard line, facing a second down and ten.

Three plays later, running back Jay Graham crossed the goal line for the first Tennessee touchdown of the second quarter. The extra point was good, and with 13:23 remaining in the first half, Tennessee took a 210 lead.|$|E
50|$|As in Zuma, {{the main}} {{objective}} of Zuma's Revenge! is to clear strings of rolling balls, or 'stones', by matching balls {{of the same}} color. Players move a ball-shooting frog which always points {{in the direction of}} the mouse to aim and fire <b>balls</b> <b>at</b> these strings. When three or more balls of the same color match together, they are cleared from the playfield. This clearing creates gaps through which a player may shoot more <b>balls</b> <b>at</b> nearby strings, target bonus fruit, and 'power up' stones. Gaps automatically close if the <b>balls</b> <b>at</b> either end of the gap are (or become) the same color, potentially creating chain reaction matching and clearing as new sets of three or more are formed.|$|R
