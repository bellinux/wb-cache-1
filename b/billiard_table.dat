5|$|Lyapunov exponents use {{logarithms}} {{to gauge}} the degree of chaoticity of a dynamical system. For example, for a particle moving on an oval <b>billiard</b> <b>table,</b> even small changes of the initial conditions result in very different paths of the particle. Such systems are chaotic in a deterministic way, because small measurement errors of the initial state predictably lead to largely different final states. At least one Lyapunov exponent of a deterministically chaotic system is positive.|$|E

5|$|The {{library is}} on the right of the hall, removed from the other rooms; it once held a <b>billiard</b> <b>table.</b> The walls are lined with tall bookcases {{containing}} rare books; the walls were otherwise covered in large square panel-like pieces of leather. The room has a richly coffered ceiling and had green and brown curtains. The house has bedrooms of various sizes, most large, with Mrs. Shepard's the biggest. Each room has distinct furnishings and from moderate to rich decoration. One particular was the Moorish room, furnished in the Moorish style, with mantel and furniture inlaid with mother of pearl. The third floor had bedrooms, a children's suite and a large playroom.|$|E

5|$|Billiard balls {{have been}} made from many {{different}} materials {{throughout the history of}} the game, including clay, wood, ivory, plastics (including celluloid, Bakelite, crystalate, and phenolic resin, polyester and acrylic) and even steel. The dominant material from 1627 until the early- to mid-20th century was ivory. The search for a substitute for ivory use was not for environmental concerns but based on economic motivation and fear of danger for elephant hunters. It was in part spurred on by a New York <b>billiard</b> <b>table</b> manufacturer who announced a prize of $10,000 for a substitute material. The first viable substitute was celluloid billiard balls, invented by John Wesley Hyatt in 1868, but the material was volatile and highly inflammable, sometimes exploding during manufacture.|$|E

40|$|We study, by {{numerical}} simulations and semi-rigorous arguments, a two-parameter {{family of}} convex, two-dimensional <b>billiard</b> <b>tables,</b> generalizing the one-parameter class of oval billiards of Benettin [...] Strelcyn [Phys. Rev. A 17, 773 (1978) ]. We observe interesting dynamical phenomena when the <b>billiard</b> <b>tables</b> are continuously deformed from the integrable circular billiard to {{different versions of}} completely-chaotic stadia. In particular, we conjecture that {{a new class of}} ergodic <b>billiard</b> <b>tables</b> is obtained in certain regions of the two-dimensional parameter space, when the billiards are close to skewed stadia. We provide heuristic arguments supporting this conjecture, and give numerical confirmation using the powerful method of Lyapunov-weighted dynamics. Comment: 19 pages, 13 figures.

25|$|With {{substantial}} {{returns from}} his concerts and elsewhere, Mozart {{and his wife}} adopted a rather plush lifestyle. They moved to an expensive apartment, with a yearly rent of 460 florins. Mozart bought a fine fortepiano from Anton Walter for about 900 florins, and a <b>billiard</b> <b>table</b> for about 300. The Mozarts sent their son Karl Thomas to an expensive boarding school, and kept servants. Saving was therefore impossible, and the short period of financial success did nothing to soften the hardship the Mozarts were later to experience.|$|E

25|$|The house {{underwent}} a major renovation starting in 1999, including {{work on the}} exterior wood, tile, and terra cotta brick, and rebuilding the purple slate roofs. Restoration and preservation brought the house and grounds back to the state {{that they were in}} between 1881 and 1891, when the Clemenses most loved the house.

Restoration was funded in part by two federal Save America’s Treasures grants totaling $3 million. Scanning computers were also used in the restoration. The home today contains 50,000 artifacts: manuscripts, historic photographs, family furnishings, and Tiffany glass.

25|$|The {{day after}} {{arriving}} in Portland, Ladd rented a small store at 42 Front Street and sent an order to Tilton for more liquor. At that time, Portland contained 6-8 saloons and retail liquor stores, with approximately 30 retail stores. One saloon had just received its first <b>billiard</b> <b>table.</b> Ladd only grossed $41.40 {{in the last two}} weeks of April and was unable to pay the $6 property tax, instead exchanging several nights and mornings to remove two stumps from the street in lieu of payment. Early May proved better for Ladd, selling a large amount of gin to Barrell, adding the local Skidmore's California House hotel and Ainsworth's Lot Whitcomb steamer as customers. Ladd began to branch out, adding eggs, chickens, and other local goods to his liquor store. He then earned $250 by selling goods from W. D. Gookin on consignment, adding shaving soap, tobacco, paper, farm tools, blasting powder to his store. In August 1851, Ladd's gross sales were $1000.|$|E
25|$|In {{physical}} simulation, we wish {{to conduct}} experiments, such as playing billiards. The physics of bouncing billiard balls are well understood, {{under the umbrella of}} rigid body motion and elastic collisions. An initial description of the situation would be given, with a very precise physical description of the <b>billiard</b> <b>table</b> and balls, as well as initial positions of all the balls. Given a force applied to the cue ball (probably resulting from a player hitting the ball with his or her cue stick), we want to calculate the trajectories, precise motion, and eventual resting places of all the balls with a computer program. A program to simulate this game would consist of several portions, one of which would be responsible for calculating the precise impacts between the billiard balls. This particular example also turns out to be ill conditioned: a small error in any calculation will cause drastic changes in the final position of the billiard balls.|$|E

500|$|The slate bed of a <b>billiard</b> <b>table</b> {{is often}} heated to about 5 °C (9 °F) above room temperature, which helps to keep {{moisture}} {{out of the}} cloth to aid the balls rolling and rebounding in a consistent manner, and generally makes a table play faster.
