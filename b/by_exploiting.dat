A mechanical adder might represent two addends as the positions of sliding blocks, in which case they can be added with an averaging lever. If the addends are the rotation speeds of two shafts, they can be added with a differential. A hydraulic adder can add the pressures in two chambers <b>by</b> <b>exploiting</b> Newton's second law to balance forces on an assembly of pistons. The most common situation for a general-purpose analog computer is to add two voltages (referenced to ground); this can be accomplished roughly with a resistor network, but a better design exploits an operational amplifier.|$|E

5|$|In May 1762, the {{incumbent}} Whig {{government of the}} Duke of Newcastle was replaced with one led by the Scottish Tory Lord Bute. Bute's opponents worked against him by spreading the calumny {{that he was having}} an affair with the King's mother, and <b>by</b> <b>exploiting</b> anti-Scottish prejudices amongst the English. John Wilkes, a Member of Parliament, published The North Briton, which was both inflammatory and defamatory in its condemnation of Bute and the government. Wilkes was eventually arrested for seditious libel but he fled to France to escape punishment; he was expelled from the House of Commons, and found guilty in absentia of blasphemy and libel. In 1763, after concluding the Peace of Paris which ended the war, Lord Bute resigned, allowing the Whigs under George Grenville to return to power.|$|E

5|$|In the 16th century, Adriaan van Roomen {{solved the}} problem using {{intersecting}} hyperbolas, but this solution does not use only straightedge and compass constructions. François Viète found such a solution <b>by</b> <b>exploiting</b> limiting cases: {{any of the three}} given circles can be shrunk to zero radius (a point) or expanded to infinite radius (a line). Viète's approach, which uses simpler limiting cases to solve more complicated ones, is considered a plausible reconstruction of Apollonius' method. The method of van Roomen was simplified by Isaac Newton, who showed that Apollonius' problem is equivalent to finding a position from the differences of its distances to three known points. This has applications in navigation and positioning systems such as LORAN.|$|E
5|$|Later mathematicians {{introduced}} algebraic methods, which {{transform a}} geometric problem into algebraic equations. These methods were simplified <b>by</b> <b>exploiting</b> symmetries {{inherent in the}} problem of Apollonius: for instance solution circles generically occur in pairs, with one solution enclosing the given circles that the other excludes (Figure 2). Joseph Diaz Gergonne used this symmetry to provide an elegant straightedge and compass solution, while other mathematicians used geometrical transformations such as reflection in a circle to simplify {{the configuration of the}} given circles. These developments provide a geometrical setting for algebraic methods (using Lie sphere geometry) and a classification of solutions according to 33 essentially different configurations of the given circles.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{woodpeckers}} are arboreal {{birds of}} wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur {{in almost all}} suitable habitats including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where {{a small number of}} trees exist, or, in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or even, like the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance <b>by</b> <b>exploiting</b> secondary growth, plantations, orchards and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.|$|E
5|$|The 20 {{amino acids}} that are encoded {{directly}} by the codons of the universal genetic code are called standard or canonical amino acids. A modified form of methionine (N-formylmethionine) is often incorporated in place of methionine as the initial amino acid of proteins in bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Other amino acids are called non-standard or non-canonical. Most of the non-standard amino acids are also non-proteinogenic (i.e. they cannot be incorporated into proteins during translation), but {{two of them are}} proteinogenic, as they can be incorporated translationally into proteins <b>by</b> <b>exploiting</b> information not encoded in the universal genetic code.|$|E
5|$|The binary GCD {{algorithm}} is an efficient alternative that substitutes division with faster operations <b>by</b> <b>exploiting</b> the binary representation used by computers.

Additional efficiency can be gleaned by examining only the leading digits of the two numbers a and b. The binary algorithm can be extended to other bases (k-ary algorithms), with up to fivefold increases in speed. Lehmer's GCD algorithm uses the same general principle as the binary algorithm to speed up GCD computations in arbitrary bases.|$|E
