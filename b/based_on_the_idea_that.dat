5|$|Nonviolent Communication is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> {{all human}} beings have the {{capacity}} for compassion and only resort to violence or behavior that harms others {{when they do not}} recognize more effective strategies for meeting needs. Habits of thinking and speaking that lead to the use of violence (psychological and physical) are learned through culture. NVC theory supposes all human behavior stems from attempts to meet universal human needs and that these needs are never in conflict. Rather, conflict arises when strategies for meeting needs clash. NVC proposes that if people can identify their needs, the needs of others, and the feelings that surround these needs, harmony can be achieved.|$|E
5|$|Heins {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether children and adolescents are negatively impacted by exposure to violence and pornography, contending that youth are not endangered by sexually explicit material. She believes that censorship of such material from adolescents is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> minors are innocent and exposure to inappropriate media would corrupt them, explaining how this belief {{has been used as a}} basis for censorship. Heins explores whether the government or parents should restrict children's access to potentially inappropriate material, believing that the decision should rest primarily with parents. She writes that there is no simple tactic by which government can censor material from children without violating First-Amendment rights guaranteed to adults. Heins warns that attempting to categorize forms of creative expression in order to prohibit particular works of art results in censorship choices which reflect an ideological point-of-view.|$|E
5|$|In 1092, {{the peace}} {{began to break}} down. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the Scots {{controlled}} much of modern Cumbria, it had been supposed that William Rufus's new castle at Carlisle and his settlement of English peasants in the surrounds was the cause. It is unlikely that Malcolm controlled Cumbria, and the dispute instead concerned the estates granted to Malcolm by William Rufus's father in 1072 for his maintenance when visiting England. Malcolm sent messengers to discuss the question and William Rufus agreed to a meeting. Malcolm travelled south to Gloucester, stopping at Wilton Abbey to visit his daughter Edith and sister-in-law Cristina. Malcolm arrived there on 24 August 1093 to find that William Rufus refused to negotiate, insisting that the dispute {{be judged by the}} English barons. This Malcolm refused to accept, and returned immediately to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|Royal Flush {{was planned}} in April 1944 by Ronald Wingate, deputy {{controller}} of the LCS. His theory was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> the Allied nations might rely on forms {{of help from}} neutral countries following any invasions. Having seen the implementation of Operation Graffham, and with the deceptions aimed at Scandinavia and the Mediterranean, he chose Sweden, Turkey and Spain as the targets. For Sweden this was the continuation of Graffham, with demands from the US, UK and Russia that the Germans be denied access to the country following an Allied invasion of Norway. In the case of Turkey this was built on existing pressure, applied from {{the outset of the}} war, to join the Allied nations.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{about the}} origin of {{language}} differ in regard to their basic assumptions about what language is. Some theories are <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> language is so complex that one cannot imagine it simply appearing from nothing in its final form, but that it must have evolved from earlier pre-linguistic systems among our pre-human ancestors. These theories can be called continuity-based theories. The opposite viewpoint is that language is such a unique human trait that it cannot be compared to anything found among non-humans and that it must therefore have appeared suddenly in the transition from pre-hominids to early man. These theories can be defined as discontinuity-based. Similarly, theories based on Chomsky's generative view of language see language mostly as an innate faculty that is largely genetically encoded, whereas functionalist theories see it as a system that is largely cultural, learned through social interaction.|$|E
5|$|Victor Fresco, the show's creator, has cited {{his being}} a new parent as {{inspiration}} for the show. In an interview with NPR, he discussed how having a kid piqued his interest to develop a show about the disconnection between a person's public and personal lives, such as how parents teach their kids to be moral, yet work for giant corporations. According to Fresco, Ted Crisp is the single father and his daughter serves as his moral compass. Fresco stated that since he's worked for a few giant companies, he didn't base Veridian Dynamics on any specific corporation. The show's name was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> a person is better off if they are Ted, that essentially the average person wants to be Ted. Fresco has stated that he wasn't {{a fan of the}} show's title, but hadn't spoken of changing it.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way to resolve a dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E
