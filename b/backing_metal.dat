40|$|In this paper, a {{metal-backed}} {{loop antenna}} (MBLA) at high frequency (HF) is characterized {{and applied to}} a radio-frequency identification (RFID) smart-shelf system. The antenna is investigated in terms of impedance matching, resonant frequency, magnetic-field intensity/field distribution, quality factor, and detection range. The study shows that the magnetic-field distribution of the metal-backed loop antenna can be effectively controlled by changing the size {{as well as the}} separation of the <b>backing</b> <b>metal</b> plate. As a result, the detection range of an RFID system using such an antenna can be controlled. Such a feature offers great promise for the metal-backed loop antenna in applications for RFID smart-shelf systems. For such systems, controlling the coupling zone of the antennas is vital for constraining the interference between the antennas in adjacent tiers of the shelves, in order to achieve high system-detection accuracy. In addition, using a metal-backed loop antenna provides more flexibility for RFID smart-shelf-system design and implementation, so that the system is more cost effective...|$|E
40|$|Ceramic/metal {{plate is}} one of the most widely used light weight armors, {{especially}} to protect ar-mor piercing (AP) bullet. Experimental investigation of projectile penetration mechanism into the ceramic/metal plate requires costly sensitive equipment to capture impact phenomenon that completes within microseconds. Alternatively, the impact mechanism can be efficiently investi-gated using numerical simulations. Among recent investigations on the protective capability of this ceramic/metal plates, few only discussed the influence of the boundary effects on the ballistic protection. This study thus aims to examine the effect of boundary conditions by changing shapes of the plate, border constraints and bounded materials in numerical simulation. Material models of the ceramic and the <b>backing</b> <b>metal</b> plate made of aluminium 2017 -T 6 are selected. The 7. 62 AP projectile’s core was modeled by a solid cylinder. The initial projectile velocity was 940 m/s. The plates are represented by either a square or a hexagonal tile. The edges of the plates were fixed or enclosed by a soft epoxy. To investigate the effect of backing plate, a small gap was introduced between some of the ceramic and aluminum interfaces. The results showed that the hexagonal tiles reduce the deformation of the backing plate. The plates bounded by the epoxy exhibit inferior performances compared to the fixed plates. Finally, the small gap between the ceramic and the aluminum interfaces significantly increases the time to stop the projectile...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{difficult}} to use an ordinary plain bearing under a high load or at a high friction speed because lubricant oil is pushed out from the friction surface or deterioration of the lubricant oil is caused by heat of friction. A solid lubricant, MoS 2, is promising in such condition. When the lubricant is dispersed in a matrix, the solid lubricant is always supplied from the matrix. Such a composite bearing needs a <b>back</b> <b>metal</b> to maintain its shape. The heat of friction may cause a crack between the bearing and the <b>back</b> <b>metal</b> due to thermal stress. A bearing with low coefficient of friction is necessary to decrease the heat of friction, and an FGM structure is also promising to decrease the stress. The aim of this experiment is to fabricate and to examine friction properties of the composites. Cu was plated on the lubricant particles by electroless deposition. The lubricant volume fraction (hereafter Vf) was up to Vf 30 %. The Cu plated lubricant particles were hot-pressed to form a composite at 873 K under 30 MPa in a vacuum. Friction properties of the composites were determined by using a ball-on-disk type testing machine. The test was performed in the air without oil at room temperature. The solid lubricant in the composites was effective to decrease the coefficients of friction under a high load when the Vf was higher than 20 %...|$|R

40|$|This {{extended}} abstract {{describes the}} <b>back</b> <b>metal</b> optimization for PbSn die attach assembly to overcome die attach voiding issues {{that resulted in}} reliability testing failures. During the fab transfer qualification of a GaAs RF power amplifier, we encountered die bond voiding issues using a matching backside metal stack process and assembly method. The problem manifested only when the process was run at the alternate Fab. The process was transferred using a copy smart approach where the thicknesses were matched, but processing tools were different. During the pre-qualification process, die voiding issues were encountered which did not meet manufacturing indices specifications. During pre-qualification reliability failures were also encountered. Experiments were run to optimize the <b>back</b> <b>metal</b> layers to achieve passing die bond criteria specifications and reach manufacturability. In addition, reliability was validated by using a JEDEC standard battery of tests on the optimized process. BACKGROUND Freescale utilizes a metal stack specialized for high power GaAs power amplifiers which are assembled using PbSn based soft solder [1]. The process was transferred to a different Fab. The metal stack shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, and Table 1 was duplicated at the new Fab, but processing tools were not {{identical to the original}} Fab. This required validation of the new process using assembly process indices and JEDEC standard reliability testing. Special attention was paid to die bond coverage, which plays an important reliability role. Die bond coverage has been, historically, a key factor to maintain reliability and Freescale’s high quality standards...|$|R
