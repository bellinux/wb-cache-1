40|$|In 21 st century Texas, a judge’s {{decision}} to recuse from a case {{is based on}} a complex set of norms, codes and procedures intended to promote impartiality. For most of the state’s history, however, the sole ground for the removal of a judge from a case was not recusal for bias but disqualification based on rigid conditions set out in the Texas Constitution. This article examines the foundations and emergence of the modern concept of judicial recusal in Texas with the intent to illustrate a shift from rigid constitutional grounds to a more fluid approach based on judicial interpretation of a code of conduct. The author concludes that while Texas disqualification and recusal jurisprudence is conservative and restrained, {{it remains to be seen}} whether this restraint can continue unchanged in a post-Caperton era. The Caperton probability of bias standard has become part of the dialogue on recusal and disqualification in Texas, but Caperton-based challenges are unlikely to prevail in the near future because many members of the bench and <b>bar</b> <b>share</b> the belief that the state’s judicial campaign contribution restrictions and recusal jurisprudence create a firewall against violations of the Due Process Clause. The risk, however, is that continued resistance to change may further erode public confidence in existing ethical safeguards and fall short of assuaging concerns that wealthy donors continue to exercise disproportionate influence on the judiciary...|$|E

30|$|Also, {{we found}} that occasionally, a Bar itself {{may serve as a}} gatekeeper, running scripts to hide more {{valuable}} attack assets, such as the attack server or other malicious landing sites. When this happens, almost always the Bar leads to a small set of successors on redirection paths (e.g., attack servers, land sites). This {{is very different from the}} redirection performed by the script from a benign repository, for example, cloudfront.net_d 24 n 15 hnbwhuhn. In such cases, the targets of redirections are often very diverse. Based on this observation, we further measure the landing similarity, LS =[*] 1 l, where l is the number of the unique last nodes on the redirection paths associated with a repository. Again, as illustrated in Fig.  4 c, our study shows that redirection paths involving <b>Bars</b> <b>share</b> fewer end nodes than legitimate ones, and therefore, the related redirection graphs (for Bars) have a higher landing similarity (0.94 vs 0.88).|$|R

One of his fraternity brothers reveals the fallacy of their fraternity’s hero, and together they stumble across a New Age movement in which a man claims he can absorb the pain of others through hugs. Tom becomes wholly invested in the movement and climbs in the ranks, moving {{all over the country}} and cutting off almost all contact with his family. In San Francisco the movement takes on cultish overtones that trouble Tom. He remains faithful to Holy Wayne, the group’s leader, but is marginalized when he questions some new aspects of the group.|$|R

40|$|Tourism {{communication}} {{has increasingly}} been enhanced by online multimodal resources, which provide {{wide range of}} information through invitingly interactive websites that function as hypertexts (Francesconi 2014, Fodde, Denti 2008; Maci 2012). Verbal texts and images should interact dynamically, since they pragmatically co-determine {{the meaning of the}} whole advert (Bateman 2014 : 32), as recent studies in informational architecture, based on eye-tracking methods, have shown. From a broad MCDA perspective (Black 2006, Kress 2010, van Leeuwen, 2013), which includes ecolinguistics, this study focused {{on one of the most}} engaging and iconic websites dedicated to the Blue Island Capri, www. capri. net/it/. We investigated its main lines of appeal (Dyer 1988), e. g. landscape, celebrities, cuisine, luxury, shopping, ancient historical places, and cultural memory (Assman 2008). Throughout capri. net’s pages, information and persuasion are deftly blended, through a hierarchy of foregrounding, although the interaction between the images and verbal texts is not entirely dynamic, as explained in the discussion. Another major finding of our investigation is the flattening of the diachronicity of the different topics: in capri. net’s easily scrolled curtains, the history of Tiberius, or the lives of famous writers, and the presence of trendy celebrities in well-known <b>bars</b> <b>share</b> an undifferentiated dimension. Thus, the ways of seeing of prospective tourists are virtually oriented to an a-chronically alluring and ‘unique’ Capri-lifestyle dimension...|$|R
