5|$|The Klondike {{could be}} reached only by the Yukon River, either {{upstream}} from its delta, downstream from its head, or {{from somewhere in the}} middle through its tributaries. River boats could navigate the Yukon in the summer from the delta until a point called Whitehorse, above the Klondike. Travel in general was made difficult by both the geography and climate. The region was mountainous, the rivers winding and sometimes impassable; the short summers could <b>be</b> <b>hot,</b> while from October to June, during the long winters, temperatures could drop below −50°C (−58°F).|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{task of the}} metallurgists was {{to determine}} how to cast plutonium into a sphere. The difficulties became apparent when attempts to measure the density of plutonium gave inconsistent results. At first contamination was believed to be the cause, but it was soon determined that there were multiple allotropes of plutonium. The brittle α phase that exists at room temperature changes to the plastic β phase at higher temperatures. Attention then shifted to the even more malleable δ phase that normally exists in the 300°C to 450°C range. It was found that this was stable at room temperature when alloyed with aluminum, but aluminum emits neutrons when bombarded with alpha particles, which would exacerbate the pre-ignition problem. The metallurgists then hit upon a plutonium-gallium alloy, which stabilized the δ phase and could <b>be</b> <b>hot</b> pressed into the desired spherical shape. As plutonium was found to corrode readily, the sphere was coated with nickel.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System {{will remain}} roughly {{as we know}} it today until the {{hydrogen}} in the core of the Sun has been entirely converted to helium, which will occur roughly 5 billion years from now. This will mark the end of the Sun's main-sequence life. At this time, the core of the Sun will collapse, and the energy output will be much greater than at present. The outer layers of the Sun will expand to roughly 260 times its current diameter, and the Sun will become a red giant. Because of its vastly increased surface area, the surface of the Sun will be considerably cooler (2,600 K at its coolest) than it is on the main sequence. The expanding Sun is expected to vaporize Mercury and render Earth uninhabitable. Eventually, the core will <b>be</b> <b>hot</b> enough for helium fusion; the Sun will burn helium for a fraction of the time it burned hydrogen in the core. The Sun is not massive enough to commence the fusion of heavier elements, and nuclear reactions in the core will dwindle. Its outer layers will move away into space, leaving a white dwarf, an extraordinarily dense object, half the original mass of the Sun but only the size of Earth. The ejected outer layers will form what is known as a planetary nebula, returning some of the material that formed the Sun—but now enriched with heavier elements like carbon—to the interstellar medium.|$|E

25|$|The {{rainy season}} of Nigeria brings in cooler weather {{to the country}} {{as a result of an}} {{increased}} cloud cover that acts as a blockage to the intense sunshine of the tropics by blocking much of the suns rays in the rainy season; this in turn cools the land, and the winds above the ground remains cool thereby making for cooler temperatures during the rainy season.

25|$|Some metals may {{be forged}} cold, but {{iron and steel}} are almost always hot forged. Hot forging {{prevents}} the work hardening that would result from cold forging, which would increase the difficulty of performing secondary machining operations on the piece.

25|$|First, {{a pattern}} {{is made from}} {{polystyrene}} foam, which {{can be done by}} many different ways. For small volume runs the pattern can be hand cut or machined from a solid block of foam; if the geometry is simple enough it can even be cut using a hot-wire foam cutter. If the volume is large, then the pattern can be mass-produced by a process similar to injection molding. Pre-expanded beads of polystyrene are injected into a preheated aluminum mold at low pressure. Steam is then applied to the polystyrene which causes it to expand more to fill the die. The final pattern is approximately 97.5% air and 2.5% polystyrene. Pre-made pouring basins, runners, and risers can <b>be</b> <b>hot</b> glued to the pattern to finish it.|$|E
25|$|The {{municipality}} has rolling hills, {{mountain ranges}} and flatlands. Most {{of the rolling}} hills cross the territory from south to north, paralleling the Querétaro-San Luis Potosí highway.

Altitude varies from 1,900 to 2,460 meters above sea level with the highest elevations at mountains called El Buey, Pie de Gallo, El Patol, El Nabo, and El Paisano. The city proper is on a plain at 1,900 meters. There is only one river, the Querétaro River, which carved the La Cañada. There are numerous streams, many of them seasonal, and fresh water springs near the mountain areas. The climate is temperate and semi-dry in which the summers can <b>be</b> <b>hot,</b> with high up to 36C in May and June. Freezing temperatures are possible in the winter.|$|E
25|$|Zeolites have uses in {{advanced}} reprocessing methods, where their micro-porous ability to capture some ions while allowing others to pass freely, allowing many fission products to be efficiently removed from nuclear waste and permanently trapped. Equally important are the mineral properties of zeolites. Their alumino-silicate construction is extremely durable and resistant to radiation even in porous form. Additionally, {{once they are}} loaded with trapped fission products, the zeolite-waste combination can <b>be</b> <b>hot</b> pressed into an extremely durable ceramic form, closing the pores and trapping the waste in a solid stone block. This is a waste form factor that greatly reduces its hazard compared to conventional reprocessing systems. Zeolites are also used {{in the management of}} leaks of radioactive materials. For example, {{in the aftermath of the}} Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster, sandbags of zeolite were dropped into the seawater near the power plant to adsorb radioactive caesium which was present in high levels.|$|E
