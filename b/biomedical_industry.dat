40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Micro-fluid mixing is an {{important}} aspect of many of the various micro-fluidic systems used in biochemical production, <b>biomedical</b> <b>industries,</b> micro-energy systems and some electronic devices. Typically, because of size constraints and laminar flow conditions, different fluids may only have the opportunity to mix by diffusion, which is extremely rate limited. Therefore, active or highly effective passive mixing techniques are often required. In this study, two pulsed injectors are used to actively enhance mixing in a high aspect ratio microchannel (125 μm deep and 1 mm wide). The main channel has two adjacent flowing streams with 100...|$|R
