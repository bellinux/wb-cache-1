5|$|Air {{breathing}} {{fish can}} be divided into obligate air breathers and facultative air breathers. Obligate air breathers, such as the African lungfish, must <b>breathe</b> air periodically or they suffocate. Facultative air breathers, such as the catfish Hypostomus plecostomus, only <b>breathe</b> air if they need to and will otherwise rely on their gills for oxygen. Most air breathing fish are facultative air breathers that avoid the energetic cost of rising to the surface and the fitness cost of exposure to surface predators.|$|E
5|$|All sharks {{need to keep}} {{water flowing}} over their gills {{in order for them}} to <b>breathe,</b> however not all species need to be moving to do this. Those that are able to <b>breathe</b> while not {{swimming}} do so by using their spiracles to force water over their gills, thereby allowing them to extract oxygen from the water. It has been recorded that their eyes remain open while in this state and actively follow the movements of divers swimming around them and as such they are not truly asleep.|$|E
5|$|Fish from {{multiple}} groups can live {{out of the}} water for extended periods. Amphibious fish such as the mudskipper can live and move about on land for up to several days, or live in stagnant or otherwise oxygen depleted water. Many such fish can <b>breathe</b> air via a variety of mechanisms. The skin of anguillid eels may absorb oxygen directly. The buccal cavity of the electric eel may <b>breathe</b> air. Catfish of the families Loricariidae, Callichthyidae, and Scoloplacidae absorb air through their digestive tracts. Lungfish, {{with the exception of the}} Australian lungfish, and bichirs have paired lungs similar to those of tetrapods and must surface to gulp fresh air through the mouth and pass spent air out through the gills. Gar and bowfin have a vascularized swim bladder that functions in the same way. Loaches, trahiras, and many catfish <b>breathe</b> by passing air through the gut. Mudskippers <b>breathe</b> by absorbing oxygen across the skin (similar to frogs). A number of fish have evolved so-called accessory breathing organs that extract oxygen from the air. Labyrinth fish (such as gouramis and bettas) have a labyrinth organ above the gills that performs this function. A few other fish have structures resembling labyrinth organs in form and function, most notably snakeheads, pikeheads, and the Clariidae catfish family.|$|E

40|$|Background The {{commonly}} held idea that &# 039;proper&# 039; <b>breathing</b> {{is important for}} health is generally accompanied by the view that incorrect or &# 039;dysfunctional&# 039; <b>breathing</b> has adverse effects on health. It has been proposed that correction of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> through <b>breathing</b> therapy reduces symptoms and improves the health of patients with conditions such as asthma, anxiety, speech disorders, chronic muscular skeletal dysfunction and medically unexplained physical symptoms. However, investigation {{of the impact of}} dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> and <b>breathing</b> therapies is hampered by the fact that dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> is not well defined and that there are few validated measures or standard ized protocols to measure it. Aims The four main objectives of the experimental portion of thesis are: • To further develop and validate some clinical tools for assessment of dysfunctional breathing; • To explore and evaluate current methods for assessing dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> particularly those used by <b>breathing</b> therapists; • To investigate the relationships between measures of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> with a view to understanding the possible definitions and dimensions of dysfunctional breathing; and • To explore possible mechanisms of <b>breathing</b> therapy. Method A series of seven studies were untaken. Various non-experimental and quasi-experimental study designs were used These papers, which are all published (or in press) manuscripts, form the experimenta l portion of this thesis. The seven studies presented in the empirical section of this thesis are grouped in four sub-sections - The first of these contains two studies on the topic of &# 039;Measuring <b>Breathing</b> Pattern&# 039;, the second contains one study on the topic &# 039;Evaluating Dysfunctional <b>Breathing</b> Symptoms&# 039;, the third include two studies that investigate &# 039;Relationships between Measures of <b>Breathing</b> Functionality&# 039; and the final sub-section contains two studies that explores &# 039;Measures of Dysfunctional <b>Breathing</b> and <b>Breathing</b> Therapy&# 039;. Results/Discussion Manual techniques for evaluating <b>breathing</b> pattern appear to be useful and reasonably accurate for evaluating thoracic dominant <b>breathing</b> and paradoxical <b>breathing.</b> The Self Evaluation of <b>Breathing</b> Quest ionnaire appears to have two dimensions that might be related to biochemical and biomechanical aspects of <b>breathing</b> dysfunction. Poor relationships between different categories of measures of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> suggest that dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> has several dimensions. <b>Breathing</b> pattern appears to moderate dyspnea and altering <b>breathing</b> pattern may be one mechanism of <b>breathing</b> therapy. Conclusion While dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> cannot be strictly defined at present, for practical purposes dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> is probably best characterized as multidimensional. Dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> can occur in at least three dimensions: biochemical, <b>breathing</b> pattern and <b>breathing</b> related symptoms and these might not co-exist.   Comprehensive measurement of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> should include measures that evaluate all these dimensions. The therapeutic mechanisms of <b>breathing</b> theory are likely to be comple x and include psychological, biomechanical and physiological parameters. However, dysfunctional patterns of <b>breathing</b> are one factor that influences patients&# 039; response to <b>breathing</b> therapy. Also correction of dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> patterns is one likely therapeutic pathway of <b>breathing</b> therapy, particularly for patients with dyspnea...|$|R

50|$|A pneumograph or {{respiratory}} {{strain gauge}} uses a flexible sensor band that is placed around the chest, abdomen, or both. The strain gauge method can provide feedback {{about the relative}} expansion/contraction of the chest and abdomen, and can measure respiration rate (the number of breaths per minute). Clinicians can use a pneumograph to detect and correct dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> patterns and behaviors. Dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> patterns include clavicular <b>breathing</b> (<b>breathing</b> that primarily relies on the external intercostals and the accessory muscles of respiration to inflate the lungs), reverse <b>breathing</b> (<b>breathing</b> where the abdomen expands during exhalation and contracts during inhalation), and thoracic <b>breathing</b> (shallow <b>breathing</b> that primarily relies on the external intercostals to inflate the lungs). Dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> behaviors include apnea (suspension of <b>breathing),</b> gasping, sighing, and wheezing.|$|R
5|$|Crocodilians were {{traditionally}} {{thought to}} <b>breathe</b> like mammals, with airflow {{moving in and}} out tidally, but studies published in 2010 and 2013 conclude that crocodilians <b>breathe</b> more like birds, with airflow moving in a unidirectional loop within the lungs. When a crocodilian inhales, air flows through the trachea and into two primary bronchi, or airways, which branch off into narrower secondary passageways. The air continues to move through these, then into even narrower tertiary airways, and then into other secondary airways which were bypassed the first time. The air then flows back into the primary airways and is exhaled back out. These aerodynamic valves within the bronchial tree have been hypothesised to explain how crocodilians can have unidirectional airflow without the aid of avian-like air sacs.|$|E
5|$|Narrowing of the airways occurs due to {{inflammation}} and scarring within them. This {{contributes to the}} inability to <b>breathe</b> out fully. The greatest reduction in air flow occurs when breathing out, as the pressure in the chest is compressing the airways at this time. This can result in more air from the previous breath remaining within the lungs when the next breath is started, resulting {{in an increase in}} the total volume of air in the lungs at any given time, a process called hyperinflation or air trapping. Hyperinflation from exercise is linked to shortness of breath in COPD, as it is less comfortable to <b>breathe</b> in when the lungs are already partly full. Hyperinflation may also worsen during an exacerbation.|$|E

Therefore, {{in the present study}} the effect of <b>breathing</b> exercises on autonomic functions was performed in young volunteers in the age group of 17 - 19 yr. Methods: A total of 60 male undergraduate medical students were randomly divided into two groups: slow <b>breathing</b> group (that practiced slow <b>breathing</b> exercise) and the fast <b>breathing</b> group (that practiced fast <b>breathing</b> exercise). The <b>breathing</b> exercises were practiced for a period of three months. Autonomic function tests were performed before and after the practice of <b>breathing</b> exercises. Results: The increased parasympathetic activity and decreased sympathetic activity were observed in slow <b>breathing</b> group, whereas no significant change in autonomic functions was observed in the fast <b>breathing</b> group. Interpretation & conclusion: The findings of the present study show that regular practice of slow <b>breathing</b> exercise for three months improves autonomic functions, while practice of fast <b>breathing</b> exercise for the same duration does not affect the autonomic functions.

40|$|Variations in {{respiratory}} pattern {{influence the}} heart rate spectrum. It has been suggested, hence, that metronomic respiration {{should be used to}} correctly assess vagal modulation of heart rate by using spectral analysis. On the other hand, <b>breathing</b> to a metronome has been reported to increase heart rate spectral power in the high- or respiratory frequency region; this finding has led to the suggestion that metronomic respiration enhances vagal tone or alters vagal modulation of heart rate. To investigate whether metronomic <b>breathing</b> complicates the interpretation of heart rate spectra by altering vagal modulation, we recorded the electrocardiogram and respiration from eight volunteers during three <b>breathing</b> trials of 10 min each: 1) spontaneous <b>breathing</b> (mean rate of 14. 4 breaths/min); 2) <b>breathing</b> to a metronome at the rate of 15, 18, and 21 breaths/min for 2, 6, and 2 min, respectively; and 3) <b>breathing</b> to a metronome at the rate of 18 breaths/min for 10 min. Data were also collected from eight volunteers who <b>breathed</b> spontaneously for 20 min and <b>breathed</b> metronomically at each subject's mean spontaneous <b>breathing</b> frequency for 20 min. Results from the three 10 -min <b>breathing</b> trials showed that heart rate power in the respiratory frequency region was smaller during metronomic <b>breathing</b> than during spontaneous <b>breathing.</b> This decrease could be explained fully by the higher <b>breathing</b> frequencies used during trials 2 and 3 of metronomic <b>breathing.</b> When the subjects <b>breathed</b> metronomically at each subject's mean <b>breathing</b> frequency, {{the heart rate}} powers during metronomic <b>breathing</b> were similar to those during spontaneous <b>breathing.</b> Our results suggest that vagal modulation of heart rate is not altered and vagal tone is not enhanced during metronomic <b>breathing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Various <b>breathing</b> {{training}} programmes {{may be helpful}} for adults with asthma.

The objectives of this review are to explore how each of these dimensions might impact on asthma sufferers, to review how various <b>breathing</b> therapy protocols target these dimensions and to determine if there is evidence suggesting how <b>breathing</b> therapy protocols might be optimised. Databases and reference lists of articles were searched for peer-reviewed English language studies that discussed asthma or dysfunctional <b>breathing</b> and various <b>breathing</b> therapies.
