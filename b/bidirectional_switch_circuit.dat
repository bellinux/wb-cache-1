This circuit breaker is demonstrated with BJT as a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switch.</b> The operation of the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switch</b> is analyzed for different operating conditions to determine the limitations of this design. <b>Bidirectional</b> <b>switches</b> with TRIAC, IGBT are commercially available however circuit breaker with BJT as a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switch</b> is a new approach for low voltage circuit protection...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} a novel method {{in improving the}} input current total harmonic distortion as well as power factor of a three-phase diode rectifier circuit. In this method, three <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switches</b> comprising MOSFET and four diodes are used across the three-phase supply and load. In a three-phase rectifier only two diodes conduct at any given time. As a result, the current in the third phase is zero. But in this method, the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switch</b> corresponding to the third phase is turned ON. The closing of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switches</b> provides an alternate path for the input current to flow. Once the input voltage crosses zero-voltage axes, the corresponding switch will be triggered. The fuzzy logic based control method is used to generate the triggering pulse for the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switches.</b> The conduction angle of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switch</b> is adjusted to make the output power constant and at the rated value for converter operation above and below its rated power. The performances of DC motor drive as well as Induction motor drive are evaluated with this method. The analysis, simulation and experimental results of three phase rectifier are also presented in this study...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} a multilevel {{voltage source inverter}} that {{has been designed to}} reduce circuit complexity by optimising the use of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switches.</b> The proposed inverter is built by adding an auxiliary circuit comprising an arrangement of <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switches</b> to the three-phase, six-switch, full-bridge configuration. Several <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switches</b> are made to function in the optimised mode in which their operations are divided among the three phases. The presence of the optimised mode considerably reduces the number of power switches as the number of levels in the line-to-line voltage waveform increases. A novel modulation scheme based on space vector concept with virtual vectors utilisation has also been developed. A detailed study of the proposed inverter is described through the example of a five-level structure. The performance of the proposed inverter is analysed through MATLAB/SIMULINK simulation and verified via the practical tests conducted on a laboratory prototype with a DSP-based controller. A comparison is also made against classical multilevel inverters to complete the analysis...|$|R

50|$|It is {{possible}} to separately control the input current shape in each branch of the diode bridge by inserting a <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switch</b> into the node, as shown in Figure 3. The switch Ta controls the current by controlling the magnetization of the inductor. Switched on charges the inductor which drives the current through the <b>bidirectional</b> <b>switch.</b> Deactivating the switch increases causes the current to bypass the switch and flow through the freewheeling diodes Da+ and Da-. This results in a negative voltage across the inductor and drains it.
