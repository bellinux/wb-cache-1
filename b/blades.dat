5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the <b>Blades</b> of Exile, {{replacing}} the <b>Blades</b> of Athena used in previous installments {{and the opening}} moments of this game. The weapon {{is a pair of}} <b>blades</b> that are attached to chains wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms, which can be swung in a number of maneuvers. During the game, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Claws of Hades, the Nemean Cestus, and the Nemesis Whip—with other combat options. The Nemean Cestus, a pair of gauntlets, and the Nemesis Whip, which is similar to the <b>Blades</b> of Exile, are required to advance in parts of the game; for example, the Nemean Cestus is needed to break through objects composed of onyx.|$|E
5|$|Pistorius {{began running}} in 2004 after a rugby knee injury {{which led to}} {{rehabilitation}} at the University of Pretoria's High Performance Centre with coach Ampie Louw. His first racing <b>blades</b> were fitted by South African prosthetist Francois Vanderwatt. Because {{he was unable to}} find suitable running <b>blades</b> in Pretoria, Vanderwatt ordered some to be made by a local engineer at Hanger Orthopedic Group. These quickly broke, and Vanderwatt referred Pistorius to American prosthetist and Paralympic sprinter Brian Frasure to be fitted for carbon-fibre <b>blades</b> by Icelandic company Össur.|$|E

50|$|A <b>blade</b> {{connector}} {{is a type}} {{of single}} wire connection using a flat conductive <b>blade</b> which is inserted into a <b>blade</b> receptacle. Usually both <b>blade</b> connector and <b>blade</b> receptacle have wires attached to them either through of the wire to the <b>blade</b> or crimping of the <b>blade</b> to the wire. In some cases the <b>blade</b> is an integral manufactured part of a component (such as a switch or a speaker unit), and a <b>blade</b> receptacle is pushed onto the <b>blade</b> to form a connection.|$|R
5|$|The engines power an 18.59metre {{diameter}} five-bladed main rotor. The rotor <b>blades</b> {{are constructed}} from carbon/glass with nomex honeycomb and rohacell foam, edged with titanium alloy in a sandwich construction. The shaping {{of the main}} rotor <b>blades</b> {{is derived from the}} BERP rotor <b>blades</b> first used on the Westland Lynx. This blade design improves aerodynamic efficiency at the blade tip and reduces the acoustic signature. Improved BERP IV rotors have since been developed; when installed, this increases the AW101's maximum takeoff weight.|$|E
5|$|The {{replacement}} of the Mk1's metal rotor <b>blades</b> with aluminium and glass fibre composite rotor <b>blades</b> saw these aircraft designated Chinook HC Mk1B.

5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running <b>blades</b> {{within a few months}} before the 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the <b>blades</b> provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the <b>blades</b> were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust the height of the prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} rotor <b>blade</b> {{dynamics}} on aerodynamic and structural loads is examined for a conventional, main- rotor helicopter using both a comprehensive rotorcraft analysis (CAMRAD) and night test data. The impact of <b>blade</b> dynamics on <b>blade</b> section lift-coefficient time histories is studied by comparing predictions from both a rigid <b>blade</b> analysis and an elastic <b>blade</b> analysis with helicopter flight test data. The elastic <b>blade</b> analysis better predicts high-frequency behavior of section lift. In addition, {{components of the}} <b>blade</b> angle of attack, such as elastic <b>blade</b> twist, <b>blade</b> nap rate, <b>blade</b> slope velocity, and inflow, are examined {{as a function of}} <b>blade</b> mode. Elastic <b>blade</b> motion affects the <b>blade</b> angle of attack by a few tenths of a degree, and up to the sixth rotor harmonic. A similar study of the influence of <b>blade</b> dynamics on bending and torsion moments was also conducted. The modal analysis of the predicted <b>blade</b> structural loads suggested that five elastic bending deg of freedom (four flap and one lag) and three elastic torsion deg of freedom contributed to calculations of the <b>blade</b> structural loads. However, when structural bending load predictions from several elastic <b>blade</b> analyses were compared with flight test data, an elastic <b>blade</b> model consisting of only three elastic bending modes (first and second flap, and first lag), and two elastic torsion modes was found to be sufficient for maximum correlation...|$|R

5|$|In 1994, Moscoso ran as {{the presidential}} {{candidate}} of her deceased husband's Arnulfista Party (PA) in the general election, seeking to succeed PA president Guillermo Endara. Her main rivals were Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD) candidate Ernesto Pérez Balladares and salsa singer Rubén <b>Blades,</b> who was then president of the party Papa Egoro. Moscoso and <b>Blades</b> sought to emphasize Pérez Balladares' connection with military ruler Manuel Noriega, broadcasting pictures of the two together, while Pérez Balladares worked to position himself as a successor to military ruler Omar Torrijos, who {{was regarded as a}} national hero. Moscoso's campaign, meanwhile, was hindered by public dissatisfaction with the perceived incompetence and corruption of Endara's government. Pérez Balladares ultimately won the election with 33% of the vote, with Moscoso receiving 29% and <b>Blades</b> receiving 17%.|$|E

This bolted on expansion took {{the place of the}} default <b>blade</b> cover and extended the <b>blade</b> unit to a two-width module. From a computational standpoint, the storage <b>blade</b> was no different from the compute <b>blade,</b> offering the same Intel processor options. Unlike the compute <b>blade,</b> PCIe expansion was not available in the storage <b>blade,</b> as the RAID card supporting the additional hard drives occupied this port.|$|R
5|$|Kratos is {{a warrior}} who serves the Greek gods of Olympus. Flashbacks reveal {{that he was}} once a {{successful}} captain in the Spartan army and led his men to several victories before being defeated by a barbarian king. Facing death, Kratos called on the God of War, Ares, whom he promised to serve if the god would spare his men and provide the power to destroy their enemies. Ares agreed and bonded the <b>Blades</b> of Chaos, a pair of chained <b>blades</b> forged {{in the depths of}} Tartarus, to his new servant. Kratos, equipped with the <b>blades,</b> then decapitated the barbarian king.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} a pair of <b>blades</b> {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around the character's wrists and forearms. Called Athena's <b>Blades</b> (also known as the <b>Blades</b> of Athena) in this game, they can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Barbarian Hammer, the Spear of Destiny, and periodically, the Blade of Olympus—offering alternative combat options. Although Kratos begins the game with Athena's <b>Blades</b> and the magic ability Poseidon's Rage (both at maximum power), the blade's power is reduced and the magic is relinquished after an encounter with Zeus (Poseidon's Rage can be regained by obtaining a certain urn). As with previous games, Kratos learns to use up to four magical abilities, such as Typhon's Bane that acts as a bow and arrow for distant targets, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies. Other new magical abilities include Cronos' Rage, Head of Euryale, and Atlas Quake. The special ability Rage of the Gods, featured in the previous game is replaced by Rage of the Titans; unlike the previous game, the Rage meter—which allows usage of the ability—does not have to be full in order to use the ability, and can be switched on and off at will.|$|E
5|$|Kratos' main {{weapon is}} the <b>Blades</b> of Chaos, {{a pair of}} <b>blades</b> {{attached}} to chains that are wrapped around his wrists and forearms. In gameplay, the <b>blades</b> can be swung offensively in various maneuvers. A new weapons mechanic called the World Weapon system allows Kratos to pick up weapons scattered throughout game locations or to take them from defeated foes, and to use these for a limited time. There are five World Weapons (sword, club, javelin, sling, shield) that can be collected randomly, although Kratos may possess only one at any time. When a World Weapon is not equipped, Kratos may punch or kick foes {{as part of the}} new combat system. Another new mechanic is that Kratos can tether enemies, referred to as grappling; he can hold an enemy in place with one blade while he attacks other enemies with the other blade, and he can throw the tethered enemy.|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} of <b>blade</b> slap due to <b>blade</b> vortex interaction (BVI) has been conducted.

Differences in <b>blade</b> slap contours, peak sound pressure level, and directivity for each configuration tested are noted. Additional fundamental differences, such as multiple interaction BVI, are observed and occur for only specific rotor <b>blade</b> configurations. The effect of increasing the Mach number on the BVI <b>blade</b> slap for various rotor <b>blade</b> combinations has been quantified. A peak <b>blade</b> slap Mach number scaling law is proposed.

As the game progresses, Kratos acquires new weapons—the Sun Shield and Gauntlet of Zeus—offering alternative combat options. Kratos only learns three magical abilities, as opposed to four in previous installments, including the Efreet, the Light of Dawn, and Charon's Wrath, giving him {{a variety of ways}} to attack and kill enemies. He acquires the relic Triton's Lance—similar to Poseidon's Trident in God of War— which allows him to breathe underwater; a necessary ability as parts of the game require long periods of time there.|$|E

50|$|The saw <b>blade</b> must be firmly {{mounted to}} the {{driveshaft}} {{in order to}} transmit the massive amount of torque without vibration. A larger <b>blade</b> flange usually reduces the <b>blade</b> vibration, but requires a bigger <b>blade</b> diameter.

5000|$|Retreating <b>blade</b> stall. As {{forward speed}} of the {{helicopter}} increases, the airflow over the retreating <b>blade</b> becomes relatively slower, while the airflow over the advancing <b>blade</b> is relatively faster, creating more lift. If not counteracted by flapping, this would cause dissymmetry of lift and eventually retreating <b>blade</b> stall, and <b>blade</b> stability suffers as the <b>blade</b> reaches its limits for flapping.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>blade</b> design parameters in rotor vibratory response {{and the design}} of a minimum vibration <b>blade</b> based upon this understanding are examined. Various design approaches are examined for a 4 <b>bladed</b> articulated rotor operating at a high speed flight condition. <b>Blade</b> modal shaping, frequency placement, structural and aerodynamic coupling, and intermodal cancellation are investigated to systematically identify and evaluate <b>blade</b> design parameters that influence <b>blade</b> airloads, <b>blade</b> modal response, hub loads, and fuselage vibration. The relative contributions of the various components of <b>blade</b> force excitation and response to the vibratory hub loads transmitted to the fuselage are determined in order to isolate primary candidates for vibration alleviation. A <b>blade</b> design is achieved which reduces the predicted fuselage vibration from the baseline <b>blade</b> by approximately one half. <b>Blade</b> designs are developed that offer significant reductions in vibration (and fatigue stresses) without resorting to special vibration alleviation devices, radical <b>blade</b> geometries, or weight penalties...|$|R
