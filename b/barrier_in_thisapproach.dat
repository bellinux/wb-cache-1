It strives after such generalization, which allows one to think out interdisciplinaryrelations between didactics {{within the field of}} aesthetics as well as to othereducational areas. Goodman’s aesthetics theory of symbolization and its focusing ondenotation, exemplification and expression is the main source for explanations <b>in</b> <b>thisapproach.</b> Expression is analyzed as a symptomatic and aggregate type of representationalactivities in the aesthetic disciplines of education...|$|R
40|$|Automatic Vehicle Number Plate Recognition is aspecial form {{of optical}} {{character}} recognition (OCR). Vehiclenumber plate recognition {{is a type of}} technology, mainlysoftware, which enables computer systems to read automaticallythe registration number of vehicles from digital pictures. Theproposed algorithm develops high quality recognition softwarefor the automatic recognition of vehicle license plates. <b>In</b> <b>thisapproach</b> Multilayer feed-forward back-propagation algorithmusing three hidden layers are used. The performance of theproposed algorithm has been tested on real images. Based on theexperimental results, we can conclude that our algorithm showssuperior performance using two hidden layers than singlehidden layer and the results revealed that as the number ofhidden layers is increased, more accuracy is achieved. This newapproach provides a good direction for automatic number platerecognition...|$|R
40|$|Wireless sensor {{networks}} {{consists of}} thousands of tiny, low cost, low power and multifunctional sensornodes where each sensor node has very low battery life. Purpose is to conserve the transmitted energyfrom various sensor nodes. Various energy efficient algorithms have been designed for this. LEACH usesdistributed cluster formation & randomized rotation of the cluster head to minimize the network energyconsumption. Our paper is proposing an algorithm which is the enhancement of existing IB-LEACH. Itreduces the energy consumption by using energy bank. This energy bank stores the energy after eachround in both routing and clustering phase which overall increases the life time of the network. <b>In</b> <b>thisapproach,</b> ACTIVE_ROUTE_TIMEOUT is also enhanced by shamming the static parameters ofHELLO_INTERVAL, RREQ_RETRIES and NET_DIAMETER. Results are compared through MATLABand provide better approach than previous ones...|$|R

40|$|An {{important}} feature of object-oriented programming languages is the ability todynamically instantiate user-defined container data structures such as lists, trees,and hash tables. Programs implement such data structures using references todynamically allocated objects, which allows data structures to store unboundednumbers of objects, but makes reasoning about programs more difficult. Reasoningabout object-oriented programs with complex data structures is simplified if datastructure operations are specified in terms of abstract sets of objects associatedwith each data structure. For example, an insertion into a data structure <b>in</b> <b>thisapproach</b> becomes simply an insertion into a dynamically changing set-valued fieldof an object, {{as opposed to a}} manipulation of a dynamically linked structure linkedto the object. In this paper we explore reasoning techniques for programs that manipulate datastructures specified using set-valued abstract fields associated with container objects. We compare the expressive power and the complexity of specification languagesbased on 1) decidable prefix vocabulary classes of first-order logic, 2) twovariablelogic with counting, and 3) Nelson-Oppen combinations of multisortedtheories. Such specification logics can be used for verification of object-orientedprograms with supplied invariants. Moreover, by selecting an appropriate subsetof properties expressible in such logic, the decision procedures for these logics yieldautomated computation of lattice operations in abstract interpretation domain, aswell as automated computation of abstract program semantics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract - The aim of {{the authors}} is to present a review of {{literature}} of Total Productive Maintenance and the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> implementation of Total Productive Maintenance TPM. The paper begins with {{a brief description of}} TPM and the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> implementation of TPM. Interpretive Structural Modeling ISM and its role <b>in</b> analyzing the <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> TPM implementation is explained in brief. Applications of ISM in analyzing issues in various fields are highlighted with special emphasis on TPM. The paper moves on to introduction to Structural Equation Modeling SEM and its role in validating ISM <b>in</b> analyzing <b>barriers</b> <b>in</b> implementation of TPM. The paper concludes with a gap analysis from the current literature research that can be carried out and expected outcomes from the proposed research...|$|R
