This is a two phase alloy consisting of (CrMo) 3 Si and (Cr,Mo) 5 Si 3 phases. The PM specimens, which were substantially weaker than the arc-melted materials, exhibited a stress exponent n, of about 2 and an apparent activation energy for creep, Q(sub 3), of 485 kJ/mol. The mechanism in these specimens appeared {{to be controlled by}} creep of a glassy phase. In the case of arc-melted specimens for which nis approximately 3 and Q(sub 3) is approximately 430 kJ/mol, the rate-controlling creep mechanism appeared to be that dominant in the (Cr,Mo) 5 Si 3 phase. In this case, it is suggested that the Nabarro creep mechanism, where dislocation climb is controlled by Bardeen-Herring vacancy sources, is the dominant creep mechanism. Finally, an analysis of the present and literature data on Cr 3 Si alloyed with Mo appeared to suggest that the creep rate decreases sharply with an increase in the Mo/Si ratio...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Using a {{coarse-grained}} elastic model, {{we examine}} the bending properties of anti-parallel b-sheets comprised of uniform amino-acid residues in vacuum {{as well as in}} explicit solvent. By comparing the conformational probability of the b-sheet from molecular dynamics simulations with the same quantities obtained from the coarse-grained model, we compute the elastic <b>bending</b> <b>constant,</b> k. Equilibrium fluctuations of the b-sheet and its response to external forces are well reproduced by a model with a uniform isotropic <b>bending</b> <b>constant.</b> An anisotropic <b>bending</b> model is also investigated, although the computed anisotropy is relatively weak and most of the observed properties are well described by an isotropic model. The presence of explicit solvent also lowers the <b>bending</b> <b>constant.</b> The sequence dependence of our result and its implications in protein conformational dynamics are discussed...|$|R
40|$|We use a variational {{approach}} {{to determine the}} equilibrium properties of lamellar surfactant phases.

In the limit of large bending modulus the theory converges towards Helfrich's model. For realistic values of the <b>bending</b> <b>constant</b> we find {{an increase in the}} equilibrium crumpling and layer separation and characteristic changes in the structure factor and swelling law due to film area conservation and non-linear terms in the Hamiltonian. The scaling of the free energy density, however, appears to be largely unaffected by first order crumpling corrections. ...|$|R
40|$|The splay {{and bend}} elastic {{constants}} of the bent-core oxadiazole material [C 5 -Ph-ODBP-Ph-OC 12] {{have been investigated}} {{as a function of}} temperature across the nematic phase. The <b>bend</b> <b>constant</b> K 33 is found to take values of ∼ 3. 0 pN and to be almost temperature independent, whereas, the splay constant K 11 increases monotonically from ∼ 3. 5 pN close to the isotropic phase transition to values of ∼ 9 pN deep in the nematic phase. No pretransitional divergence is observed in either K 11 or K 33 at temperatures approaching the underlying phase. This behavior of the elastic constants is distinct from that observed in rodlike liquid crystal systems but appears to share characteristics with the few other bent-core nematic systems studied to date. We discuss the interdependence of the elastic constants, the birefringence, and the order parameter to allow a comparison of the observed behavior with theory. We show that calculations of the elastic constants via molecular-field theory and atomistic modeling are in excellent qualitative as well as good quantitative (within 2 pN) agreement with the measurements across the temperature range, offering {{a deeper understanding of the}} elasticity in bent-core nematic materials than has been, hitherto, available...|$|E
40|$|Achieving {{control and}} {{tunability}} of lyotropic materials {{has been a}} long-standing goal of liquid crystal research. Here we show that the elasticity of a liquid crystal system consisting of a dense suspension of semiflexible biopolymers can be manipulated over a relatively wide range of elastic moduli. Specifically, thin films of actin filaments are assembled at an oil-water interface. At sufficiently high concentrations, one observes {{the formation of a}} nematic phase riddled with ± 1 / 2 topological defects, characteristic of a two-dimensional nematic system. As the average filament length increases, the defect morphology transitions from a U-shape into a V-shape, indicating the relative increase of the material's bend over splay modulus. Furthermore, through the sparse addition of rigid microtubule filaments, one can further control the liquid crystal elasticity. We show how the material's <b>bend</b> <b>constant</b> can be raised linearly as a function of microtubule filament density, and present a simple means to extract absolute values of the elastic moduli from purely optical observations. Finally, we demonstrate {{that it is possible to}} predict not only the static structure of the material, including its topological defects, but also the evolution of the system into dynamically arrested states. Despite the non-equilibrium nature of the material, our continuum model, which couples structure and hydrodynamics, is able to capture the annihilation and movement of defects over long time scales. Thus, we have experimentally realized a lyotropic liquid crystal system that can be truly engineered, with tunable mechanical properties, and a theoretical framework to capture its structure, mechanics, and dynamics...|$|E
40|$|The splay, twist, {{and bend}} elastic {{constants}} of an oxadiazole based bent-core liquid crystal have been measured as functions of temperature throughout the nematic phase. The splay elastic constant (K 11) behaves similarly to other bent-core systems, though it exhibits rather high values, varying between 8 - 14 pN. Further, anomalously low, temperature-independent values {{of both the}} twist and bend constants (K 22 and K 33) are found. The combination of such low values of both constants (~ 0. 15 pN and ~ 1. 2 pN) and temperature independence has not been observed in any type of nematic material previously. This unusual behaviour has been further investigated using two independent theoretical approaches; a molecular theory based on atomistic simulations of the real molecular structure and an analytical molecular-field theory. Computational calculations show good agreement with the experimental results for both the twist and bend constants. The statistical theory introduces a term related to chiral fluctuations that affects the twist constant, while the inclusion of polarity is known to explain low values of the <b>bend</b> <b>constant.</b> The additional terms enable one to understand {{the origin of the}} low values of both elastic constants and to describe their weak temperature dependence. It also offers an explanation for the spontaneous chiral segregation observed in some nematic bent-core systems.

40|$|In this thesis, {{we use a}} {{molecular}} approach to calculate the elastic <b>bending</b> <b>constants</b> of mixed (two-component) amphiphilic bilayers. This method allows us {{to account for the}} molecular detail of the bilayer 2 ̆ 7 s constituents, while incorporating the intermolecular interactions inside the bilayer within a mean field approach. The aggregate 2 ̆ 7 s free energy is calculated and then expanded up to quadratic order in curvatures and compositions, choosing a flat symmetrical bilayer as the reference state. The <b>bending</b> <b>constants</b> are obtained from the derivatives of the free energy evaluated at this reference state. As a novelty, the local compositions are allowed to fully relax upon bending, so as to ensure chemical equilibrium between the two monolayers at every curvature. The compositional degree of freedom is found to affect the <b>bending</b> <b>constant</b> k, but not the saddle-splay constant k¯. The influence on the bilayer 2 ̆ 7 s elastic properties of various chain structural features, such as length, volume, and stiffness, is investigated. This may prove useful to model bilayers composed of various types of molecules, such as hydrocarbon/hydrocarbon and hydrocarbon/fluorocarbon mixtures. ^ Additionally, we present a theoretical study of the electrostatic interactions in a system comprising two semi-infinite ionic solutions, separated by a dielectric medium of finite thickness (slab). Such system could serve as a model of an amphiphilic lipid bilayer immersed in an ionic biological solution. The space outside the slab may also include, besides the ions and the solvent (water), larger charged spherical particles intended to model certain types of proteins. A modified Poisson-Boltzmann approach is used, which allows us to treat the electrostatic interactions in an exact manner, while incorporating the finite size of the constituent particles within a mean-field approach. In particular, we focus on the study of the conditions under which the two ionic solutions are correlated across the dielectric slab. ...|$|R

40|$|Equilibrium unilamellar vesicles are {{stabilized}} {{by one of}} {{two distinct}} mechanisms depending {{on the value of}} the <b>bending</b> <b>constant.</b> Helfrich undulations ensure that the interbilayer potential is always repulsive when the <b>bending</b> <b>constant,</b> K, is of order kBT. When K ≫ kBT, unilamellar vesicles are stabilized by the spontaneous curvature that picks out a particular vesicle radius; other radii are disfavored energetically. We present measurements of the bilayer elastic constant and the spontaneous curvature, Ro, for three different systems of equilibrium vesicles by an analysis of the vesicle size distribution determined by cryo-transmission electron microscopy and small-angle neutron scattering. For cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) /sodium octyl sulfonate catanionic vesicles, K =. 7 kBT, suggesting that the unilamellar vesicles are stabilized by Helfrich-undulation repulsions. However, for CTAB and sodium perfluorooctanoate (FC 7) vesicles, K = 6 kBT, suggesting stabilization by the energetic costs of deviations from the spontaneous curvature. Adding electrolyte to the sodium perfluorooctanoate/CTAB vesicles leads to vesicles with two bilayers; the attractive interactions between the bilayers can overcome the cost of small deviations from the spontaneous curvature to form two-layer vesicles, but larger deviations to form three and more layer vesicles are prohibited.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} {{response of}} networks, gels, and brush layers is {{a manifestation of}} the elastic properties of the individual macromolecules. Furthermore, the elastic response of macromolecules to an applied force is the foundation of the single-molecule force spectroscopy techniques. The twomain classes of models describing chain elasticity include the worm-like and freely jointed chain models. The selection between these two classes ofmodels is based on the assumptions about chain flexibility. Inmany experimental situations, the choice is not clear, and a model describing the crossover between these two limiting classes is therefore in high demand. We are proposing a unified chain deformation model that describes the force-deformation curve in terms of the chain <b>bending</b> <b>constant,</b> K, and bond length, b. This model demonstrates that the worm-like and freely jointed chain models correspond to two different regimes of polymer deformation, and the crossover between these two regimes depends on the chain bending rigidity and the magnitude of the applied force. Polymer chains with <b>bending</b> <b>constant</b> K> 1 behave as a worm-like chain under tension in the interval of the applied forces f e KkBT/b and as a freely jointed chain for f g KkBT/b.

40|$|We {{performed}} {{molecular dynamics}} simulations to study equilibrium and flow properties of a liquid in a nano-channel with confining surfaces {{coated with a}} layer of grafted semiflexible polymers. The coverage spans a wide range of grafting densities from essentially isolated chains to dense brushes. The end-grafted polymers were described by a bead spring model with an harmonic potential to include the bond stiffness of the chains. We varied the rigidity of the chains, from fully flexible polymers to rigid rods, in which the configurational entropy of the chains is negligible. The brush-liquid interaction was tuned to obtain a super-hydrophobic channel, in which the liquid did not penetrate the polymer brush, giving rise to a Cassie-Baxter state. Equilibrium properties such us brush height and bending energy were measured, varying the grafting density and the stiffness of the polymers. We studied also the characteristics of the brush-liquid interface and the morphology of the polymers chains supporting the liquid for different bending rigidities. Non-equilibrium simulations were performed, moving the walls of the channel in opposite directions at constant speed, obtaining a Couette velocity profile in the bulk liquid. The molecular degrees of freedom of the polymers were studied {{as a function of the}} Weissenberg number. Also, the violation of the no-slip boundary condition and the slip properties were analyzed as a function of the shear rate, grafting density and bending stiffness.
