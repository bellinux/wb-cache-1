5|$|Theobald of Bec (c. 1090– 18April 1161) was {{archbishop}} of Canterbury from 1139 to 1161. He was a Norman; his exact birth date is unknown. Some {{time in the}} late 11th or early 12th century Theobald became a monk at the Abbey of Bec, rising {{to the position of}} abbot in 1137. King Stephen of England chose him to be Archbishop of Canterbury in 1138. Canterbury's claim to primacy over the Welsh ecclesiastics was resolved during Theobald's term of office when Pope Eugene III decided in 1148 in Canterbury's favour. Theobald faced challenges to his authority from a subordinate bishop, Henry of Blois, Bishop of Winchester and King Stephen's younger <b>brother,</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> relationship with King Stephen was turbulent. On one occasion Stephen forbade him from attending a papal council, but Theobald defied the king, which resulted in the confiscation of his property and temporary exile.

5|$|The Lucy Stone Home Site {{is owned}} and managed by The Trustees of Reservations, a {{non-profit}} land conservation and historic preservation {{organization dedicated to}} preserving natural and historic places in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The site includes 61 acres of forested land {{on the side of}} Coys Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. Although the farmhouse in which Stone was born and married burned to the ground in 1950, its ruins {{are at the center of}} the property. At the time of Stone’s wedding, both her parents and a married <b>brother</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> family lived in the two-and-one-half-story house, and family descendants continued to live there until 1936. In 1915, a pilgrimage of suffragists placed a memorial tablet on the house, which read: “This house was the birthplace of Lucy Stone, pioneer advocate of equal rights for women. Born August 13, 1818. Married May 1, 1855, died October 18, 1893. In grateful memory Massachusetts suffragists placed this tablet August 13, 1915.” That tablet, severely damaged but surviving the 1950 fire, is now in the Quaboag Historical Society Museum. After the fire, the surrounding farmland was abandoned and left to revert to forest, and it is now used for hunting and harvesting timber. The Trustees acquired the home site in 2002 and have been maintaining the property ever since.|$|E
