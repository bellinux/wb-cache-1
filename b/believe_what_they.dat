Not {{only did they}} deny the {{doctrine}} of the Trinity as unscriptural, they believed the Bible should be interpreted rationally, not in a literal manner. Their preaching focused on ethics rather than on doctrine and did not limit church membership to the converted. Unitarians did not participate in evangelistic societies due to their conviction that people informed by reason and scripture should be free to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wanted. When they did organize, they tended to focus on education and philanthropic causes.|$|E

He summed up Watts' demeanour as [...] "dry, articulate and matter-of-fact". Watts' character {{has been described as}} a counterpoint to Black; series writer Ken Horton described them as [...] "two friends who both <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> believe and would love to convert the other to his way of thinking". O'Quinn described his time on the series as [...] "rewarding", noting that his character often provided narrative exposition because Henriksen dislikes expository dialogue. His performance was described as [...] "a fine job" [...] and as having [...] "always been good". However, Watts' depth of personality and inconsistent motivation (particularly in the third season) have been criticized.|$|E

500|$|Shin Megami Tensei II {{is set in}} {{the year}} [...] "20XX", decades after the events of Shin Megami Tensei, where a war between angels and demons was fought. Opposing both sides, a man called the Hero created a world where both Law and Chaos could co-exist, where people had freedom to choose and <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> wished. In the time between the two games, the world was plagued by disasters, and the air became unbreathable. People flocked to the {{encapsulated}} city Tokyo Millennium, which was built atop the ruins of Tokyo, where mutants, fairies and demons live. The city is ruled by followers of the Messian religion in a central unit called the Center, and is divided into districts; the largest one is Valhalla, where people can compete in a gladiator tournament, with the winner gaining citizenship in the luxurious Center, which is out of reach from demons.|$|E
500|$|The {{team found}} it {{difficult}} to fill the remaining places in the company with Asian performers, especially in the chorus. [...] Four other shows with Asian themes had opened or were in rehearsal in New York, and the demand for the few Asian actors was strong. [...] Kelly and the show's choreographer, Carol Haney, journeyed to cities across the country to seek out talent. [...] Agents were sent to other cities; in Honolulu, they found nightclub singer and native Hawaiian Ed Kenney, who would originate Wang Ta. [...] Meanwhile, in New York, the three producers were visiting dance schools. [...] An advertisement in New York Chinatown newspapers received one response. [...] No formal audition was held in San Francisco's Chinatown, and the only find was Forbidden City nightclub comedian Goro [...] "Jack" [...] Suzuki (who soon changed his name to Jack Soo), who was cast as Frankie Wing, comedian at Sammy Fong's Celestial Bar. [...] The role of Fong proved difficult to cast. [...] Initially, it was given to Larry Storch, a nightclub comic, but during the Boston tryouts, it was given to another Caucasian, Larry Blyden, who was married to Carol Haney, the show's choreographer. [...] The role of Madam Liang, Master Wang's sister-in-law, fell to Juanita Hall, a light-skinned African American who had played a Tonkinese (Vietnamese) woman, Bloody Mary, in South Pacific. Another African-American performer, Diahann Carroll, was considered for the cast but not hired. [...] Rodgers later wrote, [...] "what was important was that the actors gave the illusion of being Chinese. [...] This demonstrates one of the most wonderful things about theatre audiences. [...] People want to <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> see on a stage, and they will gladly go along with whatever is done to achieve the desired effect. [...] Ask them to accept Ezio Pinza as a Frenchman , Yul Brynner as Siamese and they are prepared to meet you nine tenths of the way even before the curtain goes up." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "I think {{having a}} pilot's licence helped a little bit. One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite <b>believe</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E
