Esses estudos, aliados Ãs geotecnologias, permitem seu uso nas mais diversas aplicaÃÃes, como a utilizaÃÃo de dados de radar SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) obtidos atravÃs do Sensoriamento Remoto e utilizados em larga escala nos estudos topogrÃficos. Essas ferramentas, normalmente utilizadas com base nas tÃcnicas de SIGs (Sistema de InformaÃÃes GeogrÃficas), GPS (Global Positioning System), eoprocessamento e da Cartografia Digital, tÃm proporcionado significativas contribuiÃÃes aos estudos de monitoramento de objetos e fenÃmenos da superfÃcie terrestre e apresentam-se como importantes instrumentos de obtenÃÃo, processamento e anÃlise de dados georreferenciados. Nesse sentido, o presente trabalho, elaborado com contribuiÃÃes das geotecnologias, teve como objetivo a definiÃÃo e caracterizaÃÃo das unidades de paisagem (unidades e subunidades morfoesculturais) das bacias hidrogrÃficas do ParanÃ III (Brasil/Paraguai), localizadas na fronteira do Brasil com o Paraguai. A partir das cartas bÃsicas (geolÃgica e pedolÃgica) e temÃticas (declividade, hipsometria, curvatura {{vertical}} do relevo e do relevo sombreado), foi confeccionada a carta de unidades do modelado, diferenciada em decorrÃncia de semelhanÃas topogrÃficas, formas e declividade das vertentes e de rugosidade do terreno. Para a elaboraÃÃo das cartas temÃticas, foram utilizados os dados da missÃo SRTM. Estes dados foram refinados da resoluÃÃo espacial original de 3 arco-segundos (~ 90 m) para 1 arco-segundo (~ 30 m) e encontram-se disponibilizados pelo Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espaciais (INPE) atravÃs do projeto TOPODATA. A partir da imagem SRTM, foi criado o modelo digital de elevaÃÃo (DEM), possibilitando, dessa maneira, a obtenÃÃo de informaÃÃes tridimensionais da Ãrea de estudo (latitude, longitude e altitude), como, tambÃm, da carta de declividade, hipsomÃtrica, curvatura vertical e do relevo sombreado, essenciais para a delimitaÃÃo das unidades e subunidades morfoesculturais. Com base na classificaÃÃo taxonÃmica do relevo, proposta por Ross (1992), contemplada atÃ o terceiro tÃxon, identificaram-se oito unidades e trÃs subunidades nas bacias hidrogrÃficas do ParanÃ III (Brasil/Paraguai). Quatro unidades e trÃs subunidades estÃo no territÃrio brasileiro: Subunidade de Toledo (1. 1. 1 A), Subunidade de Santa Tereza do Oeste (1. 1. 1 B), Subunidade de Nova Santa Rosa (1. 1. 1 C), Unidade do SÃo Francisco (1. 1. 2), Unidade de Foz do IguaÃu (1. 1. 3), Unidade de Marechal CÃndido Rondon (1. 1. 4) e Unidade de GuaÃra (1. 1. 5). As outras quatro unidades morfoesculturais localizam-se em territÃrio paraguaio: Unidade de Santa FÃ Del ParanÃ (1. 2. 1), Unidade de Nueva Esperanza (1. 2. 2), Unidade de Corpus Christi (1. 2. 3) e Unidade de Salto Del GuairÃ (1. 1. 4). O estudo de caso realizado nas bacias hidrogrÃficas do ParanÃ III (Brasil/Paraguai) demonstra que as geotecnologias caracterizam-se como ferramentas indispensÃveis no processo de elaboraÃÃo de cartas temÃticas, pois proporcionam o processamento e a anÃlise de dados georreferenciados de forma rÃpida e eficiente, permitindo, assim, um melhor entendimento das paisagens, o que pode trazer subsÃdios tanto para o planejamento ambiental e territorial, como tambÃm para os futuros estudos em escalas com maior nÃvel de detalheStudies {{involving the}} identification and characterization of landscape units have been performed with good applicability in geographical sciences, particularly as tools for environmental management. These studies, combined with geotechnology, allow its use in several applications, {{such as the use}} of radar data SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) obtained from the Remote Sensing and used in large scale topographic studies. These tools, typically used techniques based on GIS (Geographic Information System), GPS (Global Positioning System), Geoprocessing and Digital Cartography, have provided significant contributions to the studies of monitoring objects and phenomena of the earth's surface and present themselves as important tools for collecting, processing and analysis of georeferenced data. In this sense, the present work, developed with contributions from geotechnologies, aimed to the definition and characterization of landscape units (morfoescultural units and subunits) from the basin of watershed ParanÃ III (Brazil / Paraguay), located on the border of Brazil with Paraguay. From the basic (geological and pedological) and themes maps (slope, hypsometry, vertical <b>bend</b> <b>relief</b> and shaded relief), the map of the modeled units was made, differentiated due to topographical similarities, shapes and steepness of the slopes and roughness of the terrain. One used data from the SRTM mission for the preparation of thematic maps. These data were refined from the original resolution of 3 arc-seconds (~ 90 m) to 1 arc second (~ 30 m) and are available by the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) through TOPODATA project. From the SRTM image, the digital elevation model (DEM) was created, allowing, in this way, to obtain three-dimensional information of the study area (latitude, longitude and altitude), as well as the map of slope, hypsometric, and vertical curvature and shading relief, essential for the delimitation of morfoescultural units and subunits. Based on the taxonomic classification of the relief proposed by Ross (1992), addressed to the third taxon, one identified eight units and three subunits in the basins of ParanÃ III (Brazil / Paraguay). Four units and three subunits are in Brazilian territory: Subunit of Toledo (1. 1. 1 a), Subunit Santa Tereza do Oeste (1. 1. 1 B), Subunit Nova Santa Rosa (1. 1. 1 C), the San Francisco Unit (1. 1. 2), Unit of Foz do IguaÃu (1. 1. 3), Unit Marechal CÃndido Rondon (1. 1. 4) and Unit GuaÃra (1. 1. 5). The other four morfoescultural units are located in Paraguayan territory: Unit Santa FÃ Del ParanÃ (1. 2. 1), Unit of Nueva Esperanza (1. 2. 2), Unit Corpus Christi (1. 2. 3) and Unit Salto Del GuairÃ (1. 1. 4). The case study conducted in the basin of watersheds ParanÃ III (Brazil / Paraguay) shows that the geotechnologies characterize themselves as indispensable tools in the preparation process of thematic maps, as they provide the processing and analysis of georeferenced data quickly and efficiently, enabling, thus, a better understanding of the landscape, which can bring benefits to both the environmental and territorial planning, as well as for future studies on scales with greater level of detai...|$|E

40|$|The {{potential}} benefits of a multibody aircraft when compared to a single body aircraft are presented. The analyses consist principally of a detailed point design analysis of three multibody and one single body aircraft, based on a selected payload of 350, 000 kg (771, 618 lb), for final aircraft definitions; sensitivity studies to evaluate the effects of variations in payload, wing semispan body locations, and fuel price; recommendations as to the research and technology requirements needed to validate the multibody concept. Two, two body, one, three body, and one single body aircraft were finalized for the selected payload, with DOC being the prime figure of merit. When compared to the single body, the multibody aircraft showed a reduction in DOC {{by as much as}} 11. 3 percent. Operating weight was reduced up to 14 percent, and fly away cost reductions ranged from 8. 6 to 13. 4 percent.

The adoption of a common wing structure also had one technical advantage: the TA11's outboard engines could counteract the weight of the longer-range model by providing <b>bending</b> <b>relief.</b> Another factor was the split preference of those within Airbus and, more importantly, prospective airliner customers. Airbus vice president for strategic planning, Adam Brown, recalled,North American operators were clearly in favour of a twinjet, while Asians wanted a quadjet.

They liked that it could be ferried with one engine out, and could fly 'anywhere'— ETOPS (extend-range twin-engine operations) hadn't begun then.|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} report {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, in partial ful lment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Engineering. Johannesburg, May 2014 Race vehicles depend mainly on passive safety systems, such as the steel collapsible steering column investigated in this report. There is no existing literature that investigates alternate impact testing methods that meet the F ed eration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) requirements. In this study, the steering columns were statically crushed to determine the e ect of residual stresses. The steering columns were observed to collapse on themselves, as the top surface deformed, the 90 bends unfolded, and the 50 bends folded further on the side supports. The reduced residual stresses in the 90 <b>bends</b> after stress <b>relief</b> annealing, resulted in a strengthening e ect and therefore a larger bending moment was required to unfold the bend. The residual stresses did not greatly a ect the overall strength and energy absorption characteristics of the steering column, because the deformation of the 90 bends only contributed a small percentage towards the energy absorption ability of the steering column. In conclusion, zero residual stresses in cold bent steel plates are desired if the plate is being unfolded as the steering column collapses, however residual stresses can be useful if the plate is being bent further. The quasi-static approximation {{has been reported to}} be suitable if the impact mass is much larger than the impact structure. The quasi-static approximation was used to calculate the acceleration-time history of each tested specimen from the static compression tests. Numerical simulation of the steering column impact test illustrated that the impact mass and steering column experienced a series of high frequency collisions. This phenomenon was due to the momentum transfer between the impact mass and steering column, i. e. the steering column locally accelerated away from the impact mass, it then slowed down as the energy was absorbed which allowed the impact mass to again collide with the steering column. The numerical simulation and experimental results showed good correlation after having been digitally ltered using a low pass digital lter with a cuto frequency of 1000 Hz as per Le Mans regulations. The quasi-static approximation was found to give excellent agreement with the digitally ltered results, however due to its nature it could not replicate the high speed oscillatory behaviour. In conclusion, the steering column under investigation was found to be inertia sensitive, and the quasi-static approximation may only be used to evaluate the energy absorption characteristics of the steering column on its own according to the FIA requirements...|$|R
40|$|Quality {{transmission}} of digital signals from a transmitting radio-relay device to a receiving one {{depends on the}} impact of environmental effects on the propagation of electromagnetic waves. In this paper {{some of the most important}} effects are explained and modeled, especially those characteristic for the frequency range within which the GRC 408 E operates. The modeling resulted in the conclusions about the quality of {{transmission of}} digital signals in the GRC 408 E radio-relay equipment. Propagation of electromagnetic waves A radio-relay link is achieved by direct electromagnetic waves, provided there is a line of sight between the transmitting and receiving antenna of a radio-relay device. Electromagnetic waves on the road are exposed to various environmental influences causing phenomena such as bending, reflection, refraction, absorption and multiple propagation. Due to these environmental effects, the quality of information transmission is not satisfactory and a radio-relay link is not reliable. The approach to the analysis of the quality of links in digital radiorelay devices is different from the one in analog radio-relay devices. Therefore, the quality is seen through errors in the received bit (BER), the propagation conditions are taken into account, a reservation for the fading is determined by other means, etc [...] Phenomena which accompany the propagation of electromagnetic waves in digital radio-relay links The propagation of direct EM waves is followed by the following phenomena: - attenuation due to propagation, - diffraction (changing table), - refraction (refraction), - reflection (refusing), - absorption (absorption) and - multiple wave propagation. Each of these has a negative effect on the quality of the received signal at the receiving antenna of the radio-relay device. Attenuation due to propagation of electromagnetic waves The main parameter for evaluating the quality of radio-relay links is the level of the field at the reception, i. e. the strength of a signal received at the entrance of the receiver. The error in the received bit (BER) is a function of the receiving field. By reducing the level of the field the BER increases and vice versa. The level of the receiving field in the absence of margin is called the nominal level of the receiving field. The difference between the nominal level and the receiving threshold represents a margin or a budget for the fading for the given BER. Diffraction is a phenomenon that follows the propagation of electromagnetic waves and indicates their ability to <b>bend</b> round the <b>relief,</b> uneven surfaces and other obstacles, during propagation through the environment. Diffraction is considered when the obstacles on the path of propagation of electromagnetic waves enter the first Fresnel zone, because then an error in the information transmission occurs. Refraction is the refraction of electromagnetic waves in the lower layers of the atmosphere and is caused by its unhomogeneity. The upper part of the EM wave front progresses faster and the wave bends towards the Earth. The phenomenon of EM wave bending towards the Earth is called refraction. Reflection When electromagnetic waves propagate near the Earth surface, a part of the wave front, reflected from the surface of the Earth, may arrive in the receiving antenna of radio relay equipment together with direct electromagnetic waves. EM waves (direct and reflected) are summed up vectorially in the receiver giving the resulting EM wave. This can cause a substantial reduction in the resulting field when compared to the field in ideal conditions, which leads to the error increase. Absorption or EM wave absorption occurs in all frequency bands and signifies a higher or lower level of attenuation of electromagnetic waves. It is taken into consideration in digital radio-relay devices which operate in the frequency range over 7 GHz. Multiple propagation of electromagnetic waves EM waves from the transmitter can reach the receiver in different ways, and such EMW propagation is known as multiple EM wave propagation in the literature. The result of multiple propagation can be the reduction of the EM field intensity or its complete disappearance. This phenomenon is called fading. Fading Fading is caused by short-term weakening of electromagnetic waves at the reception. During EMW propagation, the interaction between EM waves and objects occurs resulting in multiple copies of useful signals of different amplitude and delay values at the reception point, thus making the resulting EM field unstable. A large number of copies of the useful signal at the reception are caused by the effects of environmental impacts on the propagation of electromagnetic waves along the route, such as reflection, refraction, diffraction, and their combination. The total loss is equal to the sum of propagation weakening and fading weakening. Fading is divided into propagation fading and interference fading. Propagation fading is generally slow and does not depend on frequency. Interference fading occurs due to the appearance of multiple EM wave propagation and it can be flat or selective. Flat fading is the same in the entire frequency range. In selective fading there is degradation of basic signals, i. e. Intersymbol interference which is present at RR devices operating at higher frequencies with the data flow around 34 MBit/s and over. Model of the radio-relay system and the results of modeling The paper deals with a model as the one given in Fig. 2 The GRC 408 E RR devices are supposed to be built into mobile call centers. The following phenomena are modeled: attenuation due to propagation, diffraction, reflection and fading. Each phenomenon is modeled for typical cases. The input signal in the GRC RR 408 E device is a random binary sequence, modulated by a modulation device provided by the RR. Such a signal propagates through the particular medium towards the RR device receiving antenna. At the reception point, the transmitted and the received signal are compared in order to find an error due to the influence of some of the modeled phenomena. The modeling results are presented graphically for different effects of environmental impacts on the propagation of EM waves in RR digital devices. The graphs indicate the errors occurred during the propagation of EM waves. Conclusion Modeling the impact of environment on the propagation of EM waves in RR digital devices can show the influence of environment on the propagation of EM waves, as well as on the quality of transmission signals. The conclusion is that the choice of the terrain for setting a mobile communication center is essential for high-quality signal transmission. For high-quality transmission of digital signals in RR devices, another requirement is also important and that is the requirement for the line-of-sight transmission and free first Fresnel zone. While in analog RR devices the conditions of EMW propagation are not a key factor in calculating the quality of communication, the results of modeling show that the conditions of propagation in digital RR devices are an important factor in the calculation of the quality of communication. The obtained results are useful for modeling RR devices in mobile communication centers and for engineers working on the main design of communication systems in the Serbian Army. The next aim is to model the impact of environment on the propagation of EM waves in GRC RR 408 E/ 34 digital devices which operate within a higher frequency range and at higher data flow speeds...|$|R
