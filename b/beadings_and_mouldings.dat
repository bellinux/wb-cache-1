5000|$|The {{smallest}} size of fasteners {{are normally}} 23 gauge (0.025 inches in diameter), commonly called [...] "pin nailers" [...] and generally having no head. They {{are used for}} attaching everything from <b>beadings,</b> <b>mouldings</b> <b>and</b> so forth to furniture {{all the way up}} to medium-sized (7 to 8 inch) baseboard, crown molding and casing. Lengths are normally in the range ⅜ to 1¼ in. (10 to 32 mm), although some industrial tool manufacturers supply up to 2 in. (50 mm). The 23 gauge micro pin is rapidly gaining ground as users find that it leaves a much smaller hole than brad nails, thereby eliminating the time normally taken to fill holes and presenting a far better looking finished product.|$|R

40|$|Abstract PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} corneal confocal microscopy in the diagnosis of morphologic damage of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus in diabetic patients and to correlate corneal confocal microscopy findings with peripheral diabetic neuropathy. METHODS: Corneal sub-basal nerve plexus parameters were quantified by corneal confocal microscopy in 42 diabetic patients and 27 age-matched controls. The parameters quantified were the number of fibers, the tortuosity of fibers, the number of <b>beadings,</b> <b>and</b> the branching pattern of the fibers. Peripheral neuropathy was also quantified using the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument. RESULTS: The number of fibers, number of <b>beadings,</b> <b>and</b> branching pattern of fibers significantly decreases in diabetic patients versus control subjects (P<. 0001; P<. 0001; P=. 0006, respectively), whereas nerve tortuosity significantly increases (P<. 0001). The same corneal sub-basal nerve plexus parameters show a statistical trend, suggesting progression of corneal neuropathy with peripheral diabetic neuropathy. CONCLUSIONS: Corneal confocal microscopy represents a new tool in the diagnosis, clinical evaluation, and follow-up of peripheral diabetic neuropathy. This study found that diabetes damages corneal nerves, particularly the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus. This damage may be easily and accurately documented using corneal confocal microscopy.
