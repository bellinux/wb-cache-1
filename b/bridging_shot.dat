5000|$|In a very {{different}} role, Troubridge was used to depict {{the interior of the}} fictional [...] "USS Bedford" [...] in the 1965 cold-war film drama The Bedford Incident. British military equipment is visible in several shots, including a rack of Lee-Enfield rifles. Troubridges novel forward-sloping bridge windows are also to be seen in the <b>Bridge</b> <b>shots.</b> (The Type 15 frigate used for the opening scenes is F159: [...] ).|$|R
25|$|On {{the morning}} of October 11 at 9:30a.m., 53-year-old {{businessman}} Kenneth <b>Bridges</b> was <b>shot</b> dead while pumping fuel at an Exxon station off Interstate 95 in Spotsylvania County, Virginia, near Fredericksburg.|$|R
50|$|The famous <b>bridge</b> <b>shot</b> {{was done}} at five in the morning. The {{production}} had to bring their own bench as there were no park benches at the location. The bridge had two sets of necklace lights on a timer controlled by the city. When the sun came up, the bridge lights went off. Willis made arrangements with the city to leave the lights on {{and that he would}} let them know when they got the shot. Afterwards, they could be turned off. As they started to shoot the scene, one string of bridge lights went out, and Allen was forced to use that take.|$|R
50|$|The company's first {{project was}} Live from Amsterdam by Alter <b>Bridge.</b> <b>Shot</b> in December 2008 the Heineken Music Hall in Amsterdam, the DVD was {{directed}} by Daniel Catullo and was released on Amazon.com in 2009. In {{the past three years}} the company has produced many projects for artists such as Godsmack, Creed, Chickenfoot, Rage Against the Machine, Staind, Alter Bridge, Slash, Guns N' Roses, Three Days Grace, Stone Temple Pilots, 3 Doors Down, Daughtry, and many others. The Company is distributed in the US by EMI, E-1 in Canada, RSK in the UK, EMI in parts of Europe, Edel AG in Italy, Roadrunner in Europe, and Soulfood in Germany.|$|R
5000|$|Much {{like many}} of A-ha's early music videos (including that of [...] "Take on Me"), the music video for [...] "Butterfly, Butterfly (The Last Hurrah)" [...] was {{directed}} by Steve Barron, and features stop-frame animation by student animator Stefan Ramirez. The video shows the band playing under a <b>bridge</b> (<b>shot</b> on location in Brighton) amidst clips from previous music videos for Take On Me, The Sun Always Shines on T.V., Manhattan Skyline and Cry Wolf (all directed by Barron) intercut and projected onto the concrete pillars. The video ends with the band embracing one last time before leaping into the air, transforming into butterflies and flying away.|$|R
5000|$|All {{the scenes}} on the Reliant <b>bridge</b> were <b>shot</b> after the scenes on the Enterprise bridge, {{eliminating}} difficulty with continuity and conflicting shooting schedules. Only one actor, Walter Koenig, {{had to be}} present on both the Reliant and the Enterprise.|$|R
5000|$|The largest {{engagement}} {{involving the}} Basque navy was the Battle of Cape Machichaco, on 5 March 1937, when four naval trawlers escorting the transport ship Galdames, Bizcaia, Gipuzkoa, Donostia and Nabarra, tried {{to lure the}} rebel heavy cruiser [...] to a point within firing range of the coastal batteries. The operation was unsuccessful, ending with the sinking of Nabarra, the Gipuzkoa with her <b>bridge</b> <b>shot</b> way, {{and the other two}} trawlers scattered. The transport was eventually captured by Canarias. Gipuzkoa finally arrived at Portugalete in flames and Bizcaia headed for Bermeo, where she met the Estonian merchantman Yorbrook, previously captured by the Canarias, and forced her to make port. Donostia sought shelter in France.|$|R
50|$|The Remagen <b>Bridge</b> {{scenes were}} <b>shot</b> at Davle on the Vltava River using the old bridge. Fake towers and a fake railway tunnel were {{constructed}} for the film. The film's opening scenes - where the US Army fails {{to capture the}} Oberkassel, Bonn <b>bridge</b> - were <b>shot</b> {{just south of the}} village of Vrané nad Vltavou using the railway bridge which carries the Prague-Dobříš line over the River Vltava.|$|R

40|$|Previous studies {{concluded}} that first-time film viewers often had difficulty integrating shots {{into a coherent}} representation of the depicted events {{in the absence of}} a familiar action through the film cuts or a salient eye-gazing of a character in the film. In this study, we investigated whether diegetic sound (i. e., sound that seems to originate from the depicted cinematic space) could effectively <b>bridge</b> <b>shots</b> for first-time viewers. Across a range of films, both dialog, and salient environmental sound (e. g., barking dogs) helped first-time viewers connect shots. However, sound was not always successful in supporting first-time viewers’ interpretations. While experienced viewers were able to understand less-familiar linking sounds and environments, first-time viewers found this difficult. Overall, a range of diegetic sounds helped first-time viewers understand spatiotemporal relations between shots, but these viewers still had difficulty integrating views of unfamiliar environments...|$|R
5000|$|This is {{supported}} by the fact that Baltimore artillery (also covering the bridge at the Washington Turnpike) on the Marines' right flank was only firing round shot in an attempt to stop Thornton from crossing the <b>bridge.</b> Round <b>shot,</b> in general, is very ineffective against dispersed troops such as the light infantry of the 85th.|$|R
50|$|Nicklaus made a 15 ft {{birdie putt}} {{on the final}} stroke of his {{professional}} career. On his {{walk up to the}} final green, he received a near ten-minute standing ovation, pausing for photographs on the iconic Swilcan <b>Bridge.</b> Nicklaus <b>shot</b> an even-par 72 in his final competitive round, but his 147 (+3) missed the cut by two strokes.|$|R

40|$|A model {{registration}} system {{capable of tracking}} an object, the model of which is known, in an image sequence is presented. It integrates tracking, pose determination and updating of the visible features. The heart of our system is the pose computation method, which handles various features (points, lines and free-form curves) in a very robust way. It consists in using robust estimators in a two-stage process: a robust residual is computed for each feature and a robust function of these residuals is minimized. Our method is therefore able to give a correct estimate of the pose even when tracking errors occur. This method {{is also used to}} update the set of model features along the sequence, by finding the 2 D contours that are tracked when new 3 D features become visible. The reliability of the system has been shown on a 300 -image sequence of a <b>bridge</b> <b>shot</b> at dusk time, for an augmented reality project. Key-words: Pose computation, robust estimation, temporal registration, augmented real [...] ...|$|R
2500|$|A few shell {{splinters}} hit Leander, which fired five salvoes in a minute, then ceased fire {{to observe}} results. Leander made the flag signal [...] "Do you surrender?", the Merchant flag {{was seen to}} be lowered and the crew began to abandon ship. Leander had hit the ship {{several times in the}} forepart and through a large hole in the side, a fire burned. A boat was lowered from Leander with a boarding party to try to save the ship and two lifeboats were seen leaving the vessel, as men jumped overboard or scrambled down the side. An Italian officer in the water called out that the boarding party should not approach the ship, as it was burning and laden with ammunition. The boarding party laid off and as the fire spread, a big explosion before the <b>bridge</b> <b>shot</b> flames and smoke high into the sky, the ship settling bows first. At 12:43p.m., there was another explosion and five minutes later the ship sank under a cloud of black smoke. Leander recovered the boarding party and the Italian lifeboats while edging away.|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{to improve}} their NCAA Tournament {{position}} and remain off the bubble, the Spartans traveled to Champaign to visit an Illinois team who was looking {{to get into the}} bubble discussion. MSU started well, but Illinois answered and took the half time lead. MSU kept it close in the second half, but trailed for most of it. Bridges led the Spartans with 21 points and Ellis added 15 (13 of which came in the second half). MSU struggled inside as their lack of depth allowed Maverick Morgan to score 14 points, most over Kenny Goins. Illinois also hit 11 three-pointers as the Spartans turned the ball over 15 times. Still, MSU had a chance to tie it on two separate occasions, but a <b>Bridges</b> <b>shot</b> with less than 10 seconds remaining and Nairn's last second heave missed the mark and Spartans fell 73-70. The loss knocked the Spartans back into a fifth place tie at 10-7 in conference and left the NCAA Tournament streak still in question at 18-12.|$|R
50|$|Early in 2011, Ivanović scored {{his first}} {{goal of the}} year on 15 January 2011, in a 2-0 home win in a Premier League match against Blackburn Rovers at Stamford <b>Bridge,</b> with a <b>shot</b> from close range.|$|R
50|$|Although many of {{the main}} scenes were filmed in {{multiple}} rural Massachusetts towns, {{with the majority of}} outdoor scenes by the river and covered <b>bridge</b> being <b>shot</b> in Kent, CT at Bull's Bridge, {{many of the}} high school scenes were shot in the then-vacant Tolland High School (now Tolland Middle School) in Tolland, Connecticut. Other scenes were filmed in New Milford, CT and Gaylordsville, CT and Westhill High School in Stamford, CT.|$|R
50|$|In {{a report}} {{submitted}} to the UNHCR in 1993 by the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it was alleged that, on another occasion, during {{the murder of a}} group of 22 people on 18 June 1992, Lukić's group tore out the kidneys of several individuals, while the others were tied to cars and dragged through the streets; their children were thrown from the <b>bridge</b> and <b>shot</b> at before they hit the water.|$|R
5000|$|Day of the Wolves was {{the first}} film {{to be made in}} Lake Havasu City, Arizona. Filming made use of meager town locations, but {{completely}} omitted using the semi-completed London <b>Bridge.</b> Interior <b>shots</b> of the wolves hideout were taken at (then) abandoned apartment construction, now [...] "Acoma Apartments" [...] at the intersection of Acoma Avenue and Mesquite Avenue. Other scenes used the old airfield on the island area, and several locations on McCulloch Blvd.|$|R
50|$|The Dubuque Shot Tower is a National Historic Landmark, {{originally}} used {{to produce}} lead shot for the U.S. military's muskets. After many years of service, including munitions production during the American Civil War, it later served as a fire watchtower for a lumber yard located at the site. It was built in 1856, and is located at {{what is now the}} northern end of Bell Street, near the Dubuque Railroad <b>Bridge.</b> The <b>Shot</b> Tower is among the oldest surviving structures in Dubuque.|$|R
25|$|Production {{started in}} December 2007, {{beginning}} with various {{shots of the}} Imaginarium wagon moving about the London suburbs (to be more specific, Bounds Green, London) {{on the evening of}} 9 December. The carnival scenes were shot at Potters Field between 10–11 December; shooting then moved to the abandoned Battersea Power Station for three days, where the production had set up offices nearby. After a full day of set-up, the hanging scenes at Blackfriars <b>Bridge</b> were <b>shot</b> for three hours on the evening of 17 December.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} shot in and around Portland, Oregon. A {{temporary}} studio was constructed in Clackamas, Oregon, where all non-location photography was done, mostly interiors, including the FBI's cyber division, Jennifer Marsh's house, the FBI building elevator, several basements, etc. A scene set on {{the east end of}} the Broadway <b>Bridge</b> was <b>shot</b> both on the actual bridge {{as well as at the}} studio. A faux diner was built underneath the Broadway bridge, which was used in the movie. The birthday party for Perla Haney-Jardine's character Annie was filmed in the roller skating rink of Oaks Amusement Park.|$|R
50|$|While {{touring the}} lines on 15 May 1915, <b>Bridges</b> was <b>shot</b> through the femoral artery by a Turkish sniper. Dragged to safety he was {{evacuated}} to the hospital ship Gascon where he died the following day. His body was returned to Melbourne where he received a state funeral. He was buried on 3 September 1915, {{on the slopes of}} Mount Pleasant. The grave was designed by Walter Burley Griffin, the designer of Canberra. It is the only permanent structure designed by Griffin ever built in Canberra. The memorial stone on the grave was unveiled in 1920.|$|R
50|$|Of note, in Kansas State's 115-77 {{victory over}} Fresno State in the quarterfinals, Askia Jones of Kansas State set the NCAA postseason record of 14 three-point field goals. His final total of 62 points, spurred by nine {{consecutive}} successful three-point <b>shots</b> <b>bridging</b> {{the first and}} second halves, was also the second-highest scoring output in major-college postseason history.|$|R
50|$|On 5 November 1940 in the Atlantic, Captain Fegen, {{commanding}} the armed merchantman HMS Jervis Bay, was escorting 38 ships of Convoy HX-84, {{when they were}} attacked by the German pocket battleship Admiral Scheer. Captain Fegen immediately engaged the enemy head-on, thus giving the ships of the convoy time to scatter. Out-gunned and on fire Jervis Bay maintained the unequal fight for 22 minutes, although the captain's right arm was shattered, and even after he died when the <b>bridge</b> was <b>shot</b> from under him. He went down with his ship but {{it was due to}} him that 31 ships of the convoy escaped including the SS San Demetrio.|$|R
5000|$|Riots ensued. In March 1631, the {{enclosures}} were destroyed. An {{assembly of}} 500 men, [...] "with two drummers, two coulers and one fife in a warlike and outrageous manner did assemble themselves together armed with gunnes, pokes, halberds and other weapons". They destroyed enclosures granted to Tristram Flower in the Snead, then onto lands granted in 1625 to Sir Edward Villiers, the half brother of Buckingham. Villier's widow Lady Barbara Villiers's agent Robert <b>Bridges</b> was <b>shot</b> at and threatened, iron ore pits filled in and enclosures broken. An effigy of Lady Villier's agent, the [...] "odious projector" [...] Sir Giles Mompesson {{was thrown into}} the pits and buried.|$|R
5000|$|Next in line, Monongahela ran hard aground under Port Hudsons lower {{batteries}} {{where she}} remained {{for nearly half}} an hour, taking severe punishment. At least eight shots passed entirely through the ship. The <b>bridge</b> was <b>shot</b> from underneath Captain James P. McKinstry, wounding him and killing three others. With Kineos aid, Monongahela was refloated; and she attempted to resume her course upriver. [...] "We were nearly by the principal battery," [...] wrote Lieutenant Nathaniel W. Thomas, the executive officer, [...] "when the crank pin of the forward engine was reported heated, and the engine stopped. ..." [...] The ship became unmanageable and drifted downstream, where she anchored {{out of range of}} the Confederate guns.|$|R
5000|$|In episode [...] "Beginning" [...] {{after the}} {{eventual}} defeat of Galvatron, Hot Shot, along with Dirt Boss, Ransack, Dark Crumplezone, Brakedown, and Clocker, raced in the Speedia 500 {{to see who}} would become the new leader of Velocitron after Override left to join the Space <b>Bridge</b> project. Hot <b>Shot</b> won, becoming leader of Velocitron and signifying his growth from a cocky impetuous rookie to a confident mature leader.|$|R
6000|$|For {{some reason}} to the writer unknown General Schofield had brought along with him General D.S. Stanley, who {{commanded}} two of his divisions--ours and another, which was not [...] "in luck." [...] In the ensuing battle, when this excellent officer could stand the strain no longer, he bolted across the <b>bridge</b> like a <b>shot</b> and found relief in the hell below, where he was promptly tumbled {{out of the saddle}} by a bullet.|$|R
50|$|The scenes {{around the}} 'Arnhem' <b>bridge</b> were {{actually}} <b>shot</b> in Deventer, where a similar {{bridge over the}} IJssel was still available. Although {{a replica of the}} original road bridge in Arnhem still existed, it was, by the mid-1970s, sitting in modern urban surroundings which could not be used to portray a 1940s city. A few scenes were shot in Zutphen, where the old municipality house and the main church can be seen.|$|R
