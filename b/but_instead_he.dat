5|$|However, he was waived on October 25, {{at the end}} of {{training}} camp, in order to shrink the roster to NBA-mandated 15 players. The Pacers tried to trade Dahntay Jones and Solomon Jones to keep Rolle, but the trade fell through and the Pacers were reluctant to drop Solomon Jones {{due to a lack of}} depth in the frontcourt. Had he made the roster, Rolle would have earned $510,000, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he</b> made $50,000 in a buyout.|$|E
5|$|Chamberlain {{had agreed}} {{to play for the}} Cleveland Spiders in 1895, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he</b> joined a Class D {{baseball}} team out of Warren, Ohio in the Iron and Oil League.

5000|$|Film critic Pauline Kael, who had championed Spielberg's {{films in}} the 1970s, {{expressed}} disappointment in his later development, stating that [...] "he's become, I think, a very bad director.... And I'm a little ashamed for him, because I loved his early work.... He turned to virtuous movies. And he's become so uninteresting now.... I think that he had it in him to {{become more of a}} fluid, far-out director. <b>But,</b> <b>instead,</b> <b>he's</b> become a melodramatist." ...|$|R

5|$|In October 2010, Gascoigne {{was arrested}} for drink driving. He {{subsequently}} admitted being {{more than four times}} over the limit at Newcastle upon Tyne Magistrates Court. One day after being warned he could face a prison sentence for drink driving, Gascoigne {{was arrested for}} possession of cocaine. He should have appeared in court on 11 November to be sentenced for the drink driving offence, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he</b> went into rehab on the south coast of England. He was given an eight-week suspended sentence on 9 December 2010.|$|E

5|$|Dalyngrigge's licence from Richard II {{permitted}} him to refortify his existing manor house, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he</b> chose a fresh site {{to build}} a castle on. Construction was completed in one phase, {{and most of the}} castle is in the same architectural style. Archaeologist David Thackray has deduced from this that Bodiam Castle was built quickly, probably because of the threat from the French. Stone castles were usually time-consuming and expensive to build, often costing thousands of pounds. Dalyngrigge was Captain of the port of Brest in France from 1386 to 1387, and as a result was probably absent for {{the first years of the}} castle's construction. It replaced the old manor house as Dalyngrigge's main residence and the administrative centre of the manor. It is not recorded when Bodiam Castle was completed, but Thackray suggests that it was before 1392; Dalyngrigge did not have long to spend in the completed castle, as he was dead by 1395.|$|E

[...] Lanre Bakare of The Guardian gave the album 4 stars out of 5, writing, [...] "Woon might have been expected to return with a dancefloor-focused second album, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he's</b> taken the soul road, and it sounds like a brilliant statement of intent." ...|$|R

Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school.

5|$|After {{leaving the}} Patriots, Zolak was signed to a one-year {{contract}} by the New York Jets. With Vinny Testaverde considered the starter, Zolak was competing against Ray Lucas for a backup job. He was the second-string quarterback as training camp began, but his competition increased when the Jets signed Rick Mirer and left three quarterbacks to battle for two open spots on the team. Two days after acquiring Mirer from the Green Bay Packers, the Jets released Zolak. In October, Zolak was signed to a one-year deal by the Miami Dolphins {{to serve as the}} backup quarterback behind Damon Huard and Jim Druckenmiller. He was later made the backup behind Huard, and made his only appearance of the season on November 21, failing to complete a pass in four attempts against the Patriots. As the 1999 season wrapped up, the Dolphins signed Zolak to a contract extension, keeping him on the team for another year. Despite the retirement of Dan Marino, the Dolphins cut Zolak in May 2000. Zolak trained for the Detroit Lions during the summer after they lost Mike Tomczak for the season, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he</b> signed on as a host for Patriots Gameday alongside Bob Lobel in August, ending his professional football career.|$|E

5|$|On 21 July, Mickl wrote {{a letter}} in which he stated that he wished to again be a {{battalion}} or regimental commander, so as to not {{have to deal with}} such a large frontline. That day he had been told that the next day he should expect Choltitz to return and take over command, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he</b> spent a further three weeks commanding the 11th Panzer Division in heavy fighting against Soviet attacks. Finally, on 12 August he received a message advising that he was to be relieved by Generalmajor Wend von Wietersheim, who arrived that same day. Four days later, Mickl returned to Gera, disappointed and resentful about the demotion, as he felt that he had made a good enough impression during the fighting to be retained as commander of the division. The reason behind his relief is unclear. His performance commanding the division had not been markedly worse than comparable divisional commanders during the preceding battles, and it is possible that Wehrmacht or Army Headquarters had decided Mickl was better suited to fighting insurgents in his native Balkans, especially given his fluency in several local languages.|$|E
25|$|Stallman {{considered}} {{staying on}} at Harvard, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he</b> decided to enroll {{as a graduate}} student at MIT. He pursued a doctorate in physics for one year, but left that program to focus on his programming at the MIT AI Laboratory.|$|E

25|$|The Cimbri had {{penetrated}} {{through the}} Alps into northern Italy. The consul Quintus Lutatius Catulus had not dared to fortify the passes, <b>but</b> <b>instead</b> <b>he</b> had retreated behind the River Po, {{and so the}} land was open to the invaders. The Cimbri did not hurry, and the victors of Aquae Sextiae {{had the time to}} arrive with reinforcements.
