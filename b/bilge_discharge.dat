Discharges into coastal waters, {{along with other}} sources of marine pollution, {{have the potential to}} be toxic to marine plants, animals, and microorganisms, causing alterations such as changes in growth, disruption of hormone cycles, birth defects, suppression of the immune system, and disorders resulting in cancer, tumors, and genetic abnormalities or even death.|$|E
40|$|Disturbances, such as mass {{pollution}} events, {{threaten the}} health of vulnerable ecosystems. Recent media attention {{has focused on the}} devastating mass oil spills, but daily petroleum input from recreational and commercial ship bilge release has been overlooked. The focus of this study was the effect of petroleum products found in bilge water on fertilization success and larval viability of two sea urchin species, Lytechinus variegatus and Eucidaris tribuloides. Unlike other pollutant studies that have focused on sperm characteristics and concentrations, I chose to examine how egg integrity was compromised by petroleum products. Scanning electron microscopy revealed eggs were degraded when exposed to low levels of these pollutants. Of the three, oil was the most detrimental to Lytechinus variegatus fertilization, while gas was highly detrimental to Eucidaris tribuloides. Dosing the eggs for only two hours before introducing sperm demonstrated significant reduction in fertilization and larval survivorship. These data suggest that even relatively low and brief exposure to petroleum pollutants can have devastating effects on sea urchin reproductive success. New regulations may need to be considered when determining the safe petroleum concentration in <b>bilge</b> <b>discharge...</b>|$|E

Approach: In this study, the International Guidelines for Preventing Oils Spills and Response to Disasters were reviewed and {{the characteristics of}} oil spills were discussed. The {{advantages and disadvantages of}} various oil spill response methods were evaluated. A comparative analysis were performed on the currently available remediation technologies using 10 evaluation criteria that included cost, efficiency, time, impact on wild life, reliability, level of difficulty, oil recovery, weather, effect on physical/chemical characteristics of oil and the need for further treatment. The advantages and disadvantages of each response method were used to determine the score assigned to that method. Results: There are many government regualtions for individual countries that serve as prevention mesures for oil spills in the offshore environment.

40|$|Shipping is {{considered}} the single largest vector for the human-mediated movement of non-indigenous marine species (NIMS) around the world (e. g., Ruiz et al., 1997; Minchin and Gollasch, 2002). A variety of shipping mechanisms (e. g., ballast and <b>bilge</b> water <b>discharges,</b> biofouling, de-fouling, sea-chests, sea-sieves, anchors, chain lockers and piping; see Carlton et al., 1995; Schormann et al., 1990) are capable of transporting NIMS to new locations. Biofouling or hull fouling is now being acknowledged {{as one of the}} single most important dispersal mechanisms alongside ballast water (e. g., Cranfield et al., 1998; Thresher et al., 1999; Hewitt, 2002;Gollasch, 2002;Hewitt et al., 2004) ...|$|R

This thesis recommends an interim plan, which can be implemented {{in a relatively short}} time frame, and a permanent plan which will take several years to implement. Although a permanent solution is recommended, the focus of this thesis is on what can be done now (interim plan) to collect and treat the bilge waste. The interim plan calls for collection of the bilge waste using pump trucks and barges. The collected bilge waste would then be processed by an oil/water separator, with the separated oil being recycled. The nonoily, separator effluent would then be prefiltered and processed through a reverse osmosis unit[URL]...|$|R

The primary objectives of response to oil spill are: to prevent the spill from moving onto shore, reduce the impact on marine life and speed the degradation of any unrecovered oil. There are several physical, chemical, thermal and biological remediation technologies for oil spills including booms, skimmers, sorbents, dispersants, in-situ burning and bioremediation. Each technique has its advantages and disadvantages and the choice of a particular technique will depend on: type of oil, physical, biological and economical characteristics of the spill, location, weather and sea conditions, amount spilled and rate of spillage, depth of water column, time of the year and effectiveness of technique. Coclusion: Based on the comparative analysis, oil recovery with mechanical methods and the application of dispersants followed by bioremediation is the most effective response for marine oil spill...|$|R
40|$|Ships {{produce a}} large amount of oily wastewaters such as bilge water which needs to be treated prior to being <b>discharged.</b> <b>Bilge</b> water is a very {{challenging}} wastewater to treat due to large variations in production rates and the complex nature of the wastes in solution. Ever increasing regulations are being imposed on the treatment and release of bilge water to the environment. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a membrane process to remove oil and grease from bilge water to a level where it could be discharged into sensitive environments. This work focused on five elements of study: (1) Evaluation of feasibility and performance of bilge water treatment using a pilot scale microfiltration/ultrafiltration (MF/UF) hybrid membrane system; (2) Development of a pilot scale membrane cascade for selective removal of oil to 0 ppm or a non-detectable level from bilge water while minimizing concentrate production; (3) Establishment of an analytical method to extract and analyze organic species at very low concentration levels for the analysis of oil and grease content found in bilge water and membrane permeate; (4) Investigation of environmentally friendly membrane cleaning methods; and (5) Study of filtration mechanism in the treatment of bilge water using ultrafiltration and microfiltration. Pilot scale membrane cascade systems were designed and tested for the treatment of synthetic bilge water. Experimental results showed that the pretreatment of this oily wastewater using microfiltration, prior to ultrafiltration, is desirable as used oils and particulates can block the feed channels of UF spiral and hollow fiber modules. Backflushing is an effective technique to reduce fouling caused by "sticky" cakes in synthetic bilge water treatment using a microfiltration membrane. Membrane support structure was found to be critical in enhancing flux during backflushing. This work outlined the need for microfiltration membranes offering good particulate clearance to be used in backflushing coalescence applications. A pilot scale membrane hybrid system, consisting of a coalescing backflushed microfiltration membrane used as a pretreatment and an ultrafiltration membrane as a final polishing step, was found to be very effective in this application, producing permeate with oil and grease content well below the allowable discharge limit (15 ppm) for coastal waters. Another membrane cascade system using tubular MF and UF membranes in a first stage and flat sheet UF membranes in a second stage was found to be able to produce water containing below detectable levels of hexane extractable material. Permeates of various molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) membranes from the cascade system were collected and analyzed using an extraction procedure followed by gas chromatography (GC). Analytical results showed that solid phase extraction using ENVI- 18 sorbent retained much of the organic matter found in the bilge water and could not preserve the molecular weight distribution in the oil mixture used to prepare synthetic bilge water. n-Hexane liquid-liquid extraction technique was found to be able to preserve the molecular weight distribution of diesel and lubricating oils separated by ultrafiltration. The effect of membrane MWCO in separation of oil and grease was also studied in this work. Environmentally friendly physical membrane cleaning methods, such as backflushing with hot water or steam followed by pressurized air, were found effective in regenerating membrane flux for large pore KOCH carbon membranes in the treatment of synthetic bilge water using a MF/UF hybrid system. The beneficial effects for steam cleaning were found to be evident. Optimal cycle times between physical cleanings were determined. Filtration mechanisms in the treatment of synthetic bilge water were studied using four classical filtration models and a combined model. Experimental results of the research conducted in this study suggested that it is possible to achieve the target of removing oil from bilge water to 0 ppm or non-detectable levels through the proper design of the membrane system, selection of appropriate membranes, determination of optimal operating parameters, and assessment of membrane performance...|$|R
