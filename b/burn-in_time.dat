50|$|When the {{equivalent}} lifetime {{of the stress}} is extended into the increasing part of the bathtub-like failure-rate curve, {{the effect of the}} burn-in is a reduction of product lifetime. In a mature production {{it is not easy to}} determine whether there is a decreasing failure rate. To determine the failure time distribution for a very low percentage of the production, one would have to destroy a very large number of devices. By stressing all devices for a certain <b>burn-in</b> <b>time</b> the devices with the highest failure rate fail first and can be taken out of the cohort. Thus by applying a burn-in, early in-use system failures can be avoided at the expense (tradeoff) of a reduced yield caused by the burn-in process.|$|E

40|$|Burn-in is a {{manufacturing}} process applied to products to eliminate early {{failures in the}} factory before the products reach the customers. Various methods have been proposed for determining an optimal <b>burn-in</b> <b>time</b> of a non-repairable system or a repairable series system, assuming that system burn-in improves all components in the system. In this paper, we establish the trade-off between the component reliabilities during system burn-in and develop an optimal <b>burn-in</b> <b>time</b> for repairable non-series systems to maximize reliability. One impediment to expressing the reliability of a non-series system is in that successive failures during system burn-in cannot be described precisely because a failed component is not detected until the whole system fails. For approximating the successive failures of a non-series system during system burn-in, we considered two types of repair: minimal repair {{at the time of}} system failure, and repair at the time of component or connection failure.

30|$|This work proposes two {{sampling}} schemes without <b>burn-in</b> <b>time</b> constraint {{to estimate}} the average of an arbitrary function defined on the network nodes, for example, {{the average age of}} users in a social network. The central idea of the algorithms lies in exploiting regeneration of RWs at revisits to an aggregated super-node or to a set of nodes, and in strategies to enhance the frequency of such regenerations either by contracting the graph or by making the hitting set larger. Our first algorithm, which is based on reinforcement learning (RL), uses stochastic approximation to derive an estimator. This method can be seen as intermediate between purely stochastic Markov chain Monte Carlo iterations and deterministic relative value iterations. The second algorithm, which we call the Ratio with Tours (RT)-estimator, is a modified form of respondent-driven sampling (RDS) that accommodates the idea of regeneration.|$|E

In particular it is possible to obtain estimates of the gradient of the log posterior from each run of the particle filter, and use these estimates within a Langevin-type proposal. We propose using the recent computationally efficient approach of Nemeth et al. (2013) for obtaining such estimates.
