40|$|Safe {{guidewire}} {{placement in}} the main vessel (MV) and in the side branch (SB) does represent the key point for successful percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) in bifurcated lesions. During bifurcation PCI, SB wiring is systematically performed {{as a first step}} and is often repeated ("rewiring") during the procedure in order to treat the SB after MV stenting. Wiring and rewiring are crucial phases of bifurcation PCI which require, in the most complex cases, specific operator experience. In the present paper, the classic SB <b>wiring</b> <b>techniques</b> necessary for routine bifurcation interventions (antegrade and pullback <b>wiring</b> <b>technique)</b> as well as "advanced" <b>wiring</b> <b>techniques</b> ("reverse wire" <b>technique,</b> Venture-facilitate <b>wiring,</b> MV balloon predilation or debulking) are described. Moreover, the rewiring technique is discussed in detail, with particular attention on the tips and tricks which may facilitate the achievement of optimal result with provisional stenting (pullback rewiring) and help manage bail out situations like acute SB flow impairment after MV stenting...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Sternal {{dehiscence}} is {{a serious}} and potentially devastating complication. The present study compared the effects of two sternal closure <b>techniques,</b> simple <b>wire</b> <b>technique</b> and figure-of-eight technique, on the development and outcome of non-microbial sternal dehiscence. Methods: Medical records of all adult patients (n= 6211) that underwent cardiac operations in our clinic through median sternotomy between January 2002 and August 2008 were retrospectively reviewed {{for the development of}} non-microbial sternal dehiscence. The outcomes of 90 (1. 44 %) isolated on-pump coronary artery bypass surgery (CABG) cases that developed dehiscence were analyzed with Student's t test, Mann Whitney U test, Chi-square test and Fisher’s Exact test according to the type of sternal closure: figure-of-eight or simple <b>wire</b> <b>technique.</b> Survival analysis was made with Kaplan Meier test. Results: Figure-of-eight and simple <b>wire</b> <b>technique</b> were associated with similar rates of sternal dehiscence (1. 46 % and 1. 43 %, respectively). In addition, after the development of sternal dehiscence, these techniques were associated with similar mortality rates and postoperative outcomes (time to sternal re-fixation, prolonged ICU stay, intraaortic balloon counterpulsation use and chest re-exploration inotropic agent use and postoperative cerebrovascular accident). One patient died in each group (2. 6 % vs. 1. 9 %, respectively). Conclusion: In conclusion, present findings suggest that the most commonly used sternal closure techniques, figure-of-eight <b>technique</b> and simple <b>wire</b> <b>technique,</b> may have similar outcomes in terms of development and prognosis of non-microbial dehiscence in patient undergoing isolated on-pump CABG operations...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: A high {{incidence}} of failure of transverse thoracosternotomy closure, involving the loops of wire cutting through the sternum, remains a significant morbidity after bilateral lung transplantation. We postulated that placing peristernal wires inside the usual longitudinal wires could prevent the longitudinal wires from cutting through the sternum. The aims {{of this study were}} to investigate the biomechanical and clinical efficacy of the proposed reinforced sternal closure technique. Methods: In vitro, 24 artificial sternal models were wired with the reinforced or conventional <b>wiring</b> <b>techniques</b> and were tested either by means of longitudinal distraction or anterior–posterior shear (n = 6 per group). In vivo, the 6 -month outcomes of 70 bilateral lung transplantations, including 27 reinforced and 43 conventional <b>wiring</b> <b>techniques,</b> were assessed. Results: Reinforced wiring was stronger than conventional wiring for both longitudinal distraction (yield load: 585 ± 60 vs 334 ± 21 N [P =. 03]; maximum load: 807 ± 60 vs 525 ± 34 N [P =. 03]; postyield stiffness: 91. 0 ± 22. 0 vs 32. 8 ± 11. 8 N/mm [P =. 04]) and anterior–posterior shear (yield load: 405 ± 9 vs 364 ± 16 N [P =. 03]; postyield stiffness: 47. 4 ± 6. 1 vs 27. 5 ± 5. 1 N/mm [P =. 04]). In multivariate analysis, the use of the conventional <b>wiring</b> <b>technique</b> (odds ratio, 5. 38; P =. 04) and osteoporosis (odds ratio, 18. 31; P =. 0005) were significant risk factors associated with sternal dehiscence. In the patients with osteoporosis (n = 25), the incidence of sternal dehiscence in the reinforced wiring group (4 / 16 [25 %]) was significantly lower than that in the conventional wiring group (7 / 9 [78 %], P =. 02). Conclusion: Osteoporosis is a significant risk factor for sternal dehiscence after bilateral lung transplantation. The new reinforced sternal <b>wiring</b> <b>technique</b> provides biomechanically superior fixation of the sternum and clinically reduces the incidence of sternal dehiscence in high-risk osteoporotic patients undergoing bilateral lung transplantation...|$|R

In order not to exclude or jail the left subclavian artery with a stent, a double <b>wire</b> <b>technique</b> was used. From a femoral approach, two guide wires were positioned, one in the aortic arch and another in the subclavian artery. A stent crimped over a 16 -mm balloon and a 4 -Fr catheter was advanced over the two wires within a 14 -Fr long introducer sheath. The stent was successfully deployed and molded within the bifurcation by a kissing balloon technique, relieving the obstruction and leaving a guaranteed passage to the subclavian artery.

40|$|Background and Objective: Accidental canal {{penetration}} with attendant complications constitutes one of {{the reasons}} for abandoning the use of wires for posterior spinal fusion techniques. However, there is dearth of information on this risk when the wire is introduced through the base of spinous process as against sublaminar passage. This study was designed to evaluate hardware-related postoperative complications, especially canal penetration, in our patients who had spinal process wiring in two types of posterior <b>wiring</b> <b>techniques.</b> Materials and Methods: Patients who had either of two spinous process <b>wiring</b> <b>techniques</b> formed the population for the study. The clinical records were reviewed and the following data were extracted: Age, sex, diagnosis, operation (fusion type), preoperative neurological status, postoperative neurologic deterioration, other postoperative complication and radiologic evidence of canal encroachment. Results: One hundred and seventy four spinous processes were instrumented in 42 patients. The age of the patients ranged from 11 to 78 years while male to female ratio was 2. 5 : 1. Majority of the spinal wiring were for trauma (29 patients; 69. 0) while the remaining were tumor (6; 14. 3 %), degenerative diseases (4; 9. 5 %) and infections (3; 7. 1 %). The Rogers technique was performed in 16 (38. 1 %) patients while 26 (61. 9 %) underwent Adeolu et al. technique. One patient (2. 3 %) had neurologic deterioration while 5 patients (11. 1 %) had varying type of complications from wound infection to fracture of spinous processes.

40|$|Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc. All rights reserved. Background: Rigid sternal {{fixation}} (RSF) {{has been}} shown to reduce sternal wound complications in high-risk patients. However, the higher initial cost continues to deter its use. This study evaluates the cost of caring for high-risk sternotomy patients who underwent RSF compared with those who underwent sternal closure with a modified <b>wire</b> <b>technique</b> (MWT). Methods: A retrospective single institution review of high-risk patients who underwent MWT (n = 45) and RSF (n = 30) for primary sternal closure from 2006 to 2009 was conducted. Total hospital cost, revenue, and net cost associated with surgery and subsequent care were analyzed. Results: Overall rates of wound dehiscence and wound infections (superficial and deep) were higher in MWT patients (n = 14, 13, and 7, respectively) than RSF patients (n = 3, 2, and 0, respectively; P < 0. 05). Modified <b>wire</b> <b>technique</b> patients also required more operations (mean ± SEM: 0. 4 ± 0. 1 vs 0. 1 ± 0. 1; P = 0. 045), and had longer follow-up time (55. 0 ± 9. 1 vs 13. 4 ± 10. 5 days; P = 0. 004). Overall, the hospital suffered a greater loss caring for MWT patients (US $ 18, 903 ± 2, 160) than RSF patients (US $ 8, 935 ± 2, 647). Modified <b>wire</b> <b>technique</b> patients who developed a complication had higher costs associated with their operative hospitalization, outpatient care, and home health than RSF patients (total net loss: US $ 41, 436 ± 7327 vs US $ 10, 612 ± 4, 258; P = 0. 034). Conclusions: In high-risk patients, RSF is associated with lower rates of infections, including the "never event" mediastinitis, compared with MWT. Moreover, despite the initial higher cost, RSF affords an overall lower cost of care compared with MWT in patients at high-risk for developing sternal complications...|$|R
