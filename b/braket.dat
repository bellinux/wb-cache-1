Slot Deformation in Various Stainless Steel Bracket Products due to The Torqueing Force of Beta Titanium Wire. Stainless Steel bracket slot {{deformation}} affects force {{applied to}} teeth. The research aims to determine slot deformation of five different bracket brands namely, 3 M, Biom, Versadent, Ormco and Shinye due to torque of Beta Titanium wire 0. 021 x 0. 025 inch with torsional angle of 45 ° {{and the amount}} of torque with torsional angle of 30 ° and 45 °. The research also attempts to compare the deformation and amount of torque among all five bracket brands. Fifity Stainless Steel Edgewise brackets from five bracket group brands (n= 10) were attached on acrylic. Bracket slot measurement was carried out in two stages: firstly, deformation measurement by calculating average bracket slot height with stereoscopy microscope before and after application of torque; and secondly, measurement of torque with a torque measurement apparatus. Statistical analysis showed that there are slot deformations on the five bracket brands with clinical permanent deformation on Biom (2, 79 µm) and Shinye (2, 29 µm). The amount of torque on the five bracket brands from the highest is 3 M, Ormco, Versadent, Shinye and Biom. From correlation assessment between bracket slot deformation and amount of torque in the five brands, a difference is found in the deformation in five brands except 3 M, Ormco, Biom and Shinye. There is a difference in the amount of torque between the five brands with torsional angle of 30 ° (except 3 M and Ormco) and 45 °. It is concluded that metal compositions and manufacturing process are the factors that influence the occurrence of deformation bracket slot {{and the amount of}} torque.

40|$|We {{address the}} problem of {{completely}} characterizing multi-particle states including loss of information to unobserved degrees of freedom. In systems where non-classical interference plays a role, such as linear-optics quantum gates, such information can degrade interference in two ways, by decoherence and by distinguishing the particles. Distinguishing information, often the limiting factor for quantum optical devices, is not correctly described by previous state-reconstruction techniques, which account only for decoherence. We extend these techniques and find that a single modified density matrix can completely describe partially-coherent, partially-distinguishable states. We use this observation to experimentally characterize two-photon polarization states in single-mode optical fiber. Comment: 4 pages, 2 eps figures, uses <b>braket.</b> st...|$|E
40|$|So far, the {{infrared}} {{behavior of the}} gluon and ghost propagator based on the Gribov-Zwanziger approach predicted a positivity violating gluon propagator vanishing at zero momentum, and an infrared enhanced ghost propagator. However, recent data based on huge lattices have revealed a positivity violating gluon propagator {{which turns out to}} attain a finite nonvanishing value very close to zero momentum. At the same time the ghost propagator {{does not seem to be}} infrared enhanced anymore. We point out that these new features can be accounted for by yet unexploited dynamical effects within the Gribov-Zwanziger approach, leading to an infrared behavior in qualitatively good agreement with the new data.

40|$|The b to d d s bar {{transition}} gives {{extremely small}} branching ratios within the standard model, thus providing an appropriate ground for testing new physics. Using renormalization group technique we determine the Wilson coefficients and {{the mixing of}} the operators which contribute to the b to d d s bar transition. We consider contributions to this decay mode from the supersymmetric standard model with and without R-parity, {{as well as from}} a model with an additional neutral Z' gauge boson. Using Belle and BaBar upper bounds for the B^- to pi^- pi^- K^+ branching ratio we constrain contributions of these new physics scenarios. Then we calculate branching ratios for two- and three-body nonleptonic B^- meson decays driven by the b to d d s transition, which might be experimentally accessible.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of (two-level) Rydberg atoms with dissipative QED cavity fields {{can be described}} classically or quantum mechanically, even for very low temperatures and mean number of photons, provided the damping constant is large enough. We investigate the quantum-classical border, the entanglement and decoherence of an analytically solvable model, analog to the atom-cavity system, in which the atom (field) is represented by a (driven and damped) harmonic oscillator. The maximum value of entanglement is shown {{to depend on the}} initial state and the dissipation-rate to coupling-constant ratio. While in the original model the atomic entropy never grows appreciably (for large dissipation rates), in our model it reaches a maximum before decreasing. Although both models predict small values of entanglement and dissipation, for fixed times of the order of the inverse of the coupling constant and large dissipation rates, these quantities decrease faster, {{as a function of the}} ratio of the dissipation rate to the coupling constant, in our model.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} three {{contributions to}} the field of symbolic computation, followed by their application to symbolic physics computations. The first contribution is to interfacing systems. The Notation package, which is developed in this thesis, allows the entry and the creation of advanced notations in the Mathematica symbolic computation system. In particular, a complete and functioning notation for both Dirac's <b>BraKet</b> notation as well as a full tensorial notation, are given herein. The second part of the thesis introduces a prototype based rule inheritance language paradigm that is applicable to certain advanced pattern matching rewrite rule language models. In particular, an implementation is presented for Mathematica. After detailing this language extension, it is adopted {{throughout the rest of the}} thesis. Finally, the third major contribution is a highly efficient algorithm to canonicalize tensorial expressions. By an innovative technique this algorithm avoids the dummy index relabeling problem. Further algorithmic optimizations are then presented. The complete algorithm handles linear symmetries such as the Bianchi identities. It also fully accommodates partial derivatives as well as mixed index classes. These advances in language and notations are extensively demonstrated on problems in quantum mechanics, angular momentum, general relativity, and quasi-spin. It is shown that the developments in this thesis lead to an extremely flexible, extensible, and powerful working environment for the expression and ensuing calculation of symbolic physics computations...|$|E
40|$|Our work fits in {{the context}} of {{symplectic}} geometry and, in particular, the aim of this work is to compute minimal symplectic atlases for classical Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. A symplectic manifold (M,ω) is a 2 n-dimensional manifold M equipped with a closed and nondegenerate 2 -form ω. The basic example of symplectic manifold is R^ 2 n equipped with the standard symplectic form ω_ 0 =∑_jdx_j∧ dy_j. The first interesting result about symplectic geometry is that for all p in M there is a symplectic embedding f of the 2 n-dimensional ball equipped with the standard symplectic form (B^ 2 n(r),ω_ 0) in (M,ω) such that f(0) =p. This result gave rise to the introduction of an important symplectic invariant c_G called Gromov width: it is π(r) ^ 2 where r is the maximum radius of a ball which can be symplectically embedded in M. In [1] Rudyak-Schlenk introduced the invariant: S_B(M,ω) which is the minimal number of symplectic charts needed to cover (M,ω). An immediate lower bound for S_B(M,ω) is λ(M,ω) :=maxΓ(M,ω);B(M) where B(M) is the number of charts of a minimal (not necessarily symplectic) atlas and Γ(M,ω) :=Vol(M,ω) n!/c_G(M,ω) ^n + 1; the <b>braket</b> x denoting the maximal integer smaller than or equal to x. Their main result about minimal atlases in [1] is the following Theorem 1 i) If λ(M,ω) >= 2 n+ 1 then S_B(M,ω) =λ(M,ω). ii) If λ(M,ω) = 2 n then S_B(M,ω_M) =deg(F) + 1. In particular this corollary implies that for a projectively induced Kaehler manifold (M,ω_M) it is sufficient to know c_G(M,ω_M) and the degree of the embedding in order to compute the invariant S_B(M,ω_M). Unfortunately computing the Gromov width of a symplectic manifold is usually a very delicate problem. However in [2] Loi-Mossa-Zuddas calculated the Gromov width of Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact type. In this thesis, using the above results, we prove the following Theorem 3 Let (M,ω) be an irreducible compact Hermitian symmetric spaces of type I,II or III. Then S_B(M,ω_M) =deg(F) + 1 when the dimension of M is sufficiently large. Moreover, using the work of Loi-Mossa-Zuddas, we are able to extend this result to product of these spaces. Unfortunately the irreducible compact domain of type IV Q_n does not satisfy the hypothesis of corollary 2 thus we cannot compute S_B using the same arguments. Nevertheless, in {{the last part of the}} thesis, we provide an explicit construction of a full symplectic embedding of Q_n, namely a collection of symplectic embeddings f_i:B^ 2 n(1) → Q_n such that the closures of the images of these embeddings cover M.
