The portion of traditional <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> which departs the implant site is most likely carried away through the action of the foreign body response and is associated with a low grade inflammatory response at and near the implant site.

40|$|Hydroxyapatite is a calcium {{phosphate}} intensively proposed as a bone substitution material {{because of its}} resemblance to the constituents of minerals present in natural bone. Since hydroxyapatite’s properties are mainly adequate for nonload bearing applications, different solutions are being tested for improving these properties and upgrading them near the target values of natural bone. On the other hand, starch (a natural and biodegradable polymer) and its blends with other polymers have been proposed as constituents in hydroxyapatite mixtures due to the adhesive, gelling, and swelling abilities of starch particles, useful in preparing well dispersed suspensions and consolidated ceramic bodies.

40|$|BACKGROUND <b>Bone</b> <b>wax</b> is used {{to control}} femoral neck {{bleeding}} during open femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) surgery. Despite its widespread use, only a few case reports and small case series describe side effects after extraarticular use. It is unclear whether intraarticular use of <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> leads to such complications. However, during revision FAI surgery, we have observed various degrees of articular inflammatory reactions. QUESTIONS/PURPOSES We therefore investigated whether the <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> used intraarticularly to control femoral neck bleeding during FAI surgery could {{be associated with the}} inflammatory reactions observed at revision surgery. METHODS We visually inspected the area and analyzed biopsy specimens from all 14 patients undergoing revision surgery from March 2005 to March 2006, 11 of whom had <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> used at the time of original surgery. The three patients who did not have <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> were used as controls. RESULTS <b>Bone</b> <b>wax</b> was identified macroscopically on the femoral neck {{at the time of the}} revision surgery in all 11 patients. In all 11 patients, biopsy results indicated a foreign body-type chronic synovial inflammation. Five patients also had an associated synovial lymphoplasmacytic inflammatory reaction. No inflammatory reaction was observed in the biopsy specimens obtained from the three patients in whom <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> was not originally used.

This study aims to compare sternal healing after application of either <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> or Ostene ®. Methods Twenty-four pigs were randomized into one of three treatment groups: Ostene ®, <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> or no hemostatic treatment (control). Each animal was subjected to midline sternotomy. Either Ostene ® or <b>bone</b> <b>wax</b> was applied to the spongy bone surfaces until local hemostasis was ensured. The control group received no hemostatic treatment.

40|$|Cadmium {{is known}} to {{accumulate}} {{in the human body}} and chronic exposures have been clearly linked to adverse health effects, showing the kidney as the critical target organ. However, there is evidence of an association between extensive environmental exposure to cadmium and alterations in bone/calcium metabolism. Therefore, it is desirable to be able to measure bone cadmium non-invasively in humans. Tibia was selected as a measurement site and source-excited K-shell x-ray fluorescence was investigated both experimentally and computationally. Initially the 88 keV gamma-rays from Cd- 109 were used to assess minimum detectable level (MDL) of cadmium in phantoms comprising plaster of Paris (<b>bone)</b> and <b>wax</b> (soft tissue). An MDL of 3 - 4 mu g g(- 1) was achieved for overlying tissue thicknesses of up to 5 mm. Alternative sources were I- 125 and Am- 241. Monte Carlo simulation showed that the spectral contrast for I- 125 would be poor. The 60 keV gamma-rays from Am- 241 were more promising, provided that the 26 keV gamma-rays were filtered out. Experiments with Am- 241 confirmed that a lower MDL could be achieved. However, the product of MDL and square root of dose (a figure of merit) was not improved. Since effective doses for these source-excited x-ray fluorescence procedures are low (typically of the order of 0. 1 mu Sv or less), it may be that lower MDL would be preferred over lower dose. Nevertheless, development continues as a further reduction in MDL is highly desirable. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

In the present study, we used in vitro and in vivo approaches to evaluate the use of ASCs as a treatment strategy for age-related osteoporosis. Molecular, histological and micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) based approaches confirmed that ASCs isolated from 18 -week-old osteoporotic senescence-accelerated mice (SAMP 6) were capable of undergoing osteogenesis when cultured in either silk fibroin (SF) scaffolds or scaffold-free microtissues (ASC-MT). A single intratibial injection of CM-Dil-labeled isogeneic ASCs or ASC-MT into SAMP 6 recipients significantly improved trabecular bone quality after 6 weeks in comparison to untreated contralateral bones, as determined by micro-CT.

40|$|During {{medieval and}} pre-modern times, potash alum {{was used for}} a variety of {{purposes}} in artistic and craft contexts. Alum {{was one of the most}} important chemical compounds involved in the dyeing of textiles and the manufacture of organic lakes, used in painting and illuminating techniques. Knowledge on the various uses and functions of alum can be gathered by the studying of collections of recipes, of which hundreds of examples have survived from the Middle Ages and the pre-modern period. This study is based on a corpus of 450 recipes books mostly produced in Northern Europe between the 14 th and the end of the 16 th century. Within these sources, alum is involved in a large field of technological procedures. It acts as a siccative agent in the preparation of oils and varnishes. It was employed in the making of glues, in the coloration and the treatment of various supports (<b>bones,</b> parchment, paper, <b>wax,</b> …), in the manufacture of pigments, such as verdigris, and the purification of ultramarine. This paper details the diversity of alum applications, as described within recipe books. It will notably focus on the varied roles played by alum in the preparation and conservation of a range of colorants which were typically preserved on small pieces of linen cloth and known under the appellation of ‘tüchlein’ colors. In addition, through these collections of recipes we learn that alum not only served for artisanal purposes but it was also used in alchemical, medical, pharmaceutical and house-economical contexts. For example, alum is cited within alchemical instructions, as being involved in the producing of artificial vermilion or in the tinting and gilding of metals. It was also used for imitating gold and silver, and notably employed in the production of aurum musicum. In parallel to this initial information, recipe books also provide us with data regarding the physical qualities of alum, the diverse states in which it was supplied and possible substitutes. They also deliver some clues concerning its various geographical provenances. Thus, these sources could serve to shed light on the multiple historical roles of alum but also help in accurately estimating its technical importance. Moreover, recipe books provide a source to investigate the multiplicity of alum appellations. Questions will be addressed such as: did these denominations reflect the plurality of uses of alum or were they related with the physical properties, quality grades or geographical origins of the alum product ? Finally this paper will try to establish the relevance of collections of recipes in reconstructing the history of alum. In so doing, it will consider how these sources can be related with other sort of historical sources and how they can illuminate each other. Peer reviewe...|$|R
