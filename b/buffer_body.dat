40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine {{institutional}} autonomy as it was operationalized in the University of Malawi. Specifically, the study focussed on University of Malawi’s (UNIMA) autonomy in the post multi-party political climate of the country. Research questions were designed based upon James’ (1965) elements of university autonomy, Ashby’s (1966) ingredients of institutional autonomy, areas to be protected for institutional autonomy (Ajayi et al., 1996) and McDaniel’s (1996) components of governance. Six groups of research questions, which included governance, administrative matters, financial matters, personnel matters, academic matters and student matters were used as interview guides in the data collection exercise. The findings of the study were examined and interpreted through a framework adapted from Govindaraj et al. (1996) : Hospital Autonomy in Ghana and McDaniel’s (1996) : The paradigms of governance in higher education systems. UNIMA, the only university in Malawi (1965 – 1998), has five constituent colleges with a central administrative office. The researcher made field visits to all the five colleges and the central office and collected data by means of interviews and document review This formed the internal players. As external players also have an impact upon university autonomy, the four groups that the researcher interviewed were the government, regulatory bodies, politicians, and a public university. Out of a total of 44 interviews, 32 respondents were from internal groups and 12 respondents were from external groups. In addition, some data for the study were also drawn from university documents and publications, local newspapers, and periodicals. It was shown in this study, that since the founding of UNIMA in 1965, Government took much interest and intervened in the activities of the then only institution of higher learning in the country, imposing its control on the running of the institution. Since the emergence of multiparty politics in 1994, the role of government has been moving from state authority towards market control as a result of the liberalization of the education sector. The amount of autonomy UNIMA had gained compared to the pre- 1994 situation was notable and was increasing as government was progressively decentralizing decisions to UNIMA. Malawi is facing a rapid expansion of the higher education sector as a result of the liberalization of the education sector, evidenced by the introduction of four new private universities since 1994. The findings point to a need for the establishment of the Commission for Higher Education (CHE), to act as a <b>buffer</b> <b>body</b> between government and higher education institutions. It is also necessary to revisit the university constitution to change the provision of appointing Head of State to also be the chancellor of the university. The current heavy dependence on governmental funding is not sustainable and UNIMA should be encouraged to diversify the generation of revenue through alternative sources. Since the autonomy of UNIMA was in transition, the researcher suggests that longitudinal studies be made to ascertain the variables that might have changed over a given period. Further studies were also suggested to investigate the issue of autonomy in selected African universities and to compare these with UNIMA’s experience. Such studies could be extended to Western universities...|$|E

The study describes the relationship between the government, the TEC and higher education institutions in Botswana. The main objectives of the study are to: a) Examine the roles and functions of the TEC in Botswana’s higher education regarding policy formulation, quality assurance and coordination in the planning and development of tertiary education. b) Explore potential tensions between the roles and functions of the TEC and those of some of its stakeholders. c) Establish the performance of the TEC in relation to the three functions of policy formulation, quality assurance and coordination in the planning and development of tertiary education. The study is located within the broader framework of higher education governance. It examines the different models of higher education governance (such as state control, state interference and state supervision models) and the relationship involved between different stakeholders in governance of higher education. Furthermore, the framework focuses on the implications of the dynamics of higher education governance on the roles and functions of <b>buffer</b> <b>bodies.</b> The study adopted a single case study approach and it was designed to allow for the use of multiple sources of evidence. Data was collected through a review of both institutional and policy documents, semi-structured interviews with eight informants from the TEC and the Ministry of Education and Skills Development, as well as a survey targeting institutional heads of higher education institutions in Botswana. The use of qualitative and quantitative methods of data collection provided useful and in-depth data and allowed for triangulation. The data was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. The findings of the study reveal that there are differing conceptions of the TEC’s role in higher education in Botswana. Whereas the TEC sees itself as ‘middleman’ between the government and higher education institutions, the higher education institutions conceptualise the role of the TEC as an extension of government. The differing views on the TEC’s role, as either buffer or agent, result in different expectations of the roles and functions of the TEC. In addition, the study revealed that Botswana’s higher education system is characterised by fragmentation and duplication of roles, which limit the mandate of the TEC, thereby creating tensions between the TEC and other constituencies in the Botswana higher education system. The study thus contributes {{to the understanding of the}} roles and functions of the TEC in the governance of higher education in Botswana. It also contributes to the understanding of the relationship between the different stakeholders involved in the governance of higher education and the implications of this relationship on the roles and functions of <b>buffer</b> <b>bodies.</b> Overall, the study shows the complexities involved in the governance of higher education in a young and evolving system of higher education, and in a context in which the roles and functions of the key players are contested and inconsistently understood...|$|R

Regulation of the {{expression}} of hepatic 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase by the major end product of the biosynthetic pathway, cholesterol, and by various hormones is critical to maintaining constant serum and tissue cholesterol levels {{in the face of}} an ever-changing external environment. The ability to downregulate this enzyme provides a means to <b>buffer</b> the <b>body</b> against the serum cholesterol–raising action of dietary cholesterol. The higher the basal expression of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase, the greater the “cholesterol buffering capacity” and the greater the resistance to dietary cholesterol. This review focuses on the mechanisms of feedback and hormonal regulation of HMG-CoA reductase in intact animals rather than in cultured cells and presents the evidence that leads to the proposal that regulation of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase acts as a cholesterol buffer. Recent studies with animals have shown that feedback regulation of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase occurs at the level of translation in addition to transcription. The translational efficiency of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA is diminished through the action of dietary cholesterol. Oxylanosterols appear to be involved in this translationa...|$|R

We studied the relationship among internal Na, K, water balance, and MAP in Sprague-Dawley rats, with or without deoxycorticosterone-acetate (DOCA) salt, with or without ovariectomy (OVX). The rats were fed a low-salt (0. 1 % NaCl) or high-salt (8 % NaCl) diet for 5 weeks. DOCA salt increased MAP (16114 versus 1234 mm Hg; P 0. 05), and DOCA-OVX salt increased MAP further (18122 mm Hg; P 0. 05). DOCA salt increased the total body Na by 40 % to 45 %; however, water-free Na retention by osmotically inactive Na storage and by osmotically neutral Na/K exchange allowed the rats to maintain the extracellular volume close to normal. DOCA-OVX salt rats showed similar Na retention. However, their osmotically inactive Na storage capacity was greatly reduced and only partially compensated by neutral Na/K exchange, resulting in greater volume retention despite similar Na retention. For every 1 % wet weight total body water gain, MAP increased by 2. 30. 2 mm Hg in DOCA salt rats and 2. 50. 3 mm Hg in DOCA-OVX salt rats.

40|$|Phosphate {{groups on}} {{materials}} surfaces {{are known to}} contribute to apatite formation upon exposure of the materials in simulated body fluid and improved affinity of the materials for osteoblast-like cells. Typically, polymers containing phosphate groups are organic matrices consisting of apatite–polymer composites prepared by biomimetic process using simulated body fluid. Ca 2 + incorporation into the polymer accelerates apatite formation in simulated body fluid owing because of increase in the supersaturation degree, with respect to apatite in simulated body fluid, owing to Ca 2 + release from the polymer. However, the effects of phosphate content on the Ca 2 + release and apatite-forming abilities of copolymers in simulated body fluid are rather elusive. In this study, a phosphate-containing copolymer prepared from vinylphosphonic acid, 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate, and triethylene glycol dimethacrylate was examined. The release of Ca 2 + in Tris-NaCl <b>buffer</b> and simulated <b>body</b> fluid increased as the additive amount of vinylphosphonic acid increased. However, apatite formation was suppressed as the phosphate groups content increased despite the enhanced release of Ca 2 + from the polymer. This phenomenon was reflected by changes in the surface zeta potential. Thus, {{it was concluded that}} the apatite-forming ability of vinylphosphonic acid- 2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate-triethylene glycol dimethacrylate copolymer treated with CaCl 2 solution was governed by surface state rather than Ca 2 + release in simulated body fluid...|$|R
40|$|Transthyretin (TTR) is an {{extracellular}} {{thyroid hormone}} (TH) distributor protein. The TH distributor proteins ensure the adequate distribution of THs throughout the <b>body,</b> <b>buffer</b> against excess TH uptake into cells and maintain an extrathyroidal reserve of THs that may protect against TH deficiency when TH demand is increased. Thyroid hormones are vital for normal postnatal development. Thus, the postnatal development {{and growth of}} tissues responsive to THs has been investigated in TTR null mice. Although the developmental surge in plasma T 4 concentrations was evident in 2 -week-old TTR null mice, total and free T 4 in the plasma were significantly reduced. Characteristics of the developing TTR null mice included delayed suckling-to-weaning transition, delayed onset of growth and retarded longitudinal bone growth. In addition, ileums from newborn TTR null mice displayed disordered cellular structure and contained fewer goblet cells. Although TH homeostasis within the brain of the developing TTR null mice {{did not appear to}} be compromised, subtle differences suggested a degree of immaturity in the developing brain, such as higher protein concentrations of cerebrospinal fluid from newborn and 2 -week-old TTR null mice than in agematched wild type mice. Collectively, these studies demonstrate the importance of TTR during post-natal development and suggest that the development of the central nervous system is essentially preserved at the expense of peripheral tissues in TTR null mice...|$|R
40|$|The {{current study}} sought to expand the {{understanding}} of the differences between Hispanic and Caucasian women in regards to body image. The predominant thought in body image research appears to be that women of an ethnic minority do not internalize media images to the same level as Caucasian women, and therefore do not experience the same level of dissatisfaction if this ideal is not met. However, {{the results of this study}} yielded no significant differences between Hispanics and Caucasians on levels of either trait self-objectification or internalization. Past research had shown that familism and level of acculturation could <b>buffer</b> against negative <b>body</b> esteem, and it was hypothesized that those factors would act as buffers among Hispanic participants. However, correlation analyses for this study found that neither familism nor level of acculturation acted as a buffer among Hispanic participants. There were no significant correlations between body esteem and trait self-objectification, internalization, familism, and acculturation. Furthermore, this study examined how varying levels of skin exposure in pictures affected a woman???s level of body esteem. Results yielded no main effect of condition on level of body esteem. It is possible these results are due to the lack of difference between the two ethnicities in regards to internalization and trait self-objectification. Unrealistic media images may have become so pervasive, that the traditional, assumed protective factors of ethnicity and culture are no longer efficacious...|$|R
40|$|A major {{function}} of the brain choroid plexus (CP) is to regulate the exchange of solutes between the blood plasma and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using selective transporters. CSF inorganic phosphate (Pi) concentration is maintained at about one-half that of plasma and is potentially important because of its regulatory, structural, and biochemical functions. Phosphate is critical for ATP and DNA formation, the linked regulation between phosphate and calcium, and as an intracellular <b>buffer.</b> The human <b>body</b> has two major Pi transporter gene families known as SLC 34 (NaPi-II) and SLC 20 (PiT), which have wide tissue distribution. Although both families are secondary-active and sodium-dependent, they are distinguished by their transport mechanisms and functional properties. NaPi-II-type and PiT-type transporters are characterized by their substrate stoichiometry and inhibition profile. Unlike NaPi-II-type transporters, PiT-type transporters are not inhibited by phosphonoformic acid (PFA) and can partially substitute Li+ for Na+. Bataille et al. (unpublished) used these differences to characterize the effects of arsenate, PFA, and Li+ on CP phosphate transport. The results indicate that a PiT-type transporter is responsible for Pi transport in the CP. To further support this hypothesis, RT-PCR and western blotting were performed to definitively determine if NaPi-II-type transporters are present or absent from the CP. The results confirm the presence of PiT-like transporters but also indicate that NaPi-IIb is potentially present in the CP. Thus, the secondary-active, CP transport of phosphate out of the CSF may involve more than one family of solute carrier transporters...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{many studies}} {{confirming}} the feasibility {{and the interest}} of local anaesthesia for umbilical repair, its use is not generalized amongst the abdominal surgeons. The advantages of local anaesthesia are indeed clear, including reduced costs, reduced hospital stay and reduced post operative pain. The success of the procedure depends on the skills and the motivation of the surgeon, of the nursing teams, and of the patient him/herself. The Mayo repair is ideally performed under local anaesthesia, but should be proposed to patients suffering from limited umbilical hernia with small defects. Prosthetic repairs might also be proposed under local anaesthesia, but large defects with rectus diastasis might require a full Rives/Stoppa repair in which local anaesthesia could not be sufficient. In obese patients, laparoscopic repair might be beneficial despite higher cost and longer hospital stay. Practically local anaesthesia requires some patience and quiet in the operative room. Operators {{should be aware that}} the action of local anaesthesia is delayed after injection. Local anaesthetics should be <b>buffered</b> and at <b>body</b> temperature at time of injection. Local anaesthetics containing Adrenalin allow longer pain control, with limitation of bleeding and less toxicity. Large and brutal movements should be avoided. Ligature and section of parts of greater omentum are feasible under local anaesthesia without patient discomfort. Tension free repair should be favoured, and during Mayo repair, the only painful part of the repair is often the closure of the defect with the different stiches. The surgical and anaesthetic techniques for umbilical hernia repair should be tailored to the specific characteristics of the umbilical hernia and of the patient. There is no method of choice that might fit for every patient...|$|R
40|$|Maintenance of acid-base {{homeostasis}} is a {{vital function}} of theliving organism. Deviations of systemic acidity in eitherdirection can impose adverse consequences and when severe can threaten life itself. Acid-base disorders frequently are encountered in the outpatient {{and especially in the}} inpatient setting. Effective man-agement of acid-base disturbances, commonly a challenging task, rests with accurate diagnosis, sound understanding of the underlying pathophysiology and impact on organ function, and familiarity with treatment and attendant complications [1]. Clinical acid-base disorders are conventionally defined {{from the vantage point of}} their impact on the carbonic acid-bicarbonate buffer system. This approach is justified by the abundance of this <b>buffer</b> pair in <b>body</b> fluids; its physiologic preeminence; and the validity of the iso-hydric principle in the living organism, which specifies that all the other buffer systems are in equilibrium with the carbonic acid-bicar-bonate buffer pair. Thus, as indicated by the Henderson equation, [H+] = 24 PaCO 2 /[HCO 3] (the equilibrium relationship of the car-bonic acid-bicarbonate system), the hydrogen ion concentration of blood ([H+], expressed in nEq/L) at any moment is a function of the prevailing ratio of the arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO 2, expressed in mm Hg) and the plasma bicarbonate concentration ([HCO- 3], expressed in mEq/L). As a corollary, changes in systemic acidity can occur only through changes in the values of its two deter-minants, PaCO 2 and the plasma bicarbonate concentration. Those acid-base disorders initiated by a change in PaCO 2 are referred to as respiratory disorders; those initiated by a change in plasma bicarbon-ate concentration are known as metabolic disorders. There are four cardinal acid-base disturbances: respiratory acidosis, respiratory alka-losis, metabolic acidosis, and metabolic alkalosis. Each can be encountered alone, as a simple disorder, or can be a part of a mixed-disorder, defined as the simultaneous presence of two or more simpl...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic {{biodegradable}} poly(DL-lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) {{has been}} fabricated into thin films {{for use as}} scaffolds for cell transplantation and guided tissue regeneration. We evaluated the ability of PLGA films to provide a suitable template for directing specific cell growth and tissue formation using cells derived from retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) as an in vitro model. RPE cells were shown to attach to and proliferate on PLGA films during a 7 -day culture period. Both polymer composition and initial cell seeding density affected cell growth. PLGA films were formulated with copolymer ratios of 50 : 50 and 75 : 25 and thickness levels of 10 and 100 mum. In vitro degradation of these thin films in simulated body fluid was characterized in terms of mass loss, molecular weight loss, dimensional changes, and morphology over a time course of ten weeks. The PLGA films demonstrated a pattern typical of heterogeneous bulk degradation and exhibited an autocatalytic effect. To further modulate cellular responses, biodegradable polymers of PLGA were investigated for controlled and sustained delivery of bioactive molecules. Transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) was incorporated into microparticles of, blends of PLGA and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) as a model growth factor and released in vitro in <b>buffer</b> solutions simulating <b>body</b> fluids for up to 28 days. The release of TGF-beta 1 was affected by the PEG content and buffer pH. Increasing the PEG content or decreasing buffer pH resulted in accelerated PLGA degradation. The release of bioactive molecules from PLGA/PEG microparticles was governed by both diffusion and polymer degradation. The feasibility of controlling cell morphology and function by modification of substrate surface with defined hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains was assessed. We described the preparation and characterization of model surfaces consisting of glass domains with a diameter of 10 or 50 mum surrounded by octadecyltrichlorosilane self-assembled monolayers. The micropatterned surfaces were shown to affect initial RPE cell attachment and spreading, and modulate the expression of differentiated cell phenotype. A novel biodegradable polymer substrate was developed with micropatterned surfaces composed of PLGA and a block copolymer of PEG and poly(DL-lactic acid) (PDLLA). We demonstrated that engineering of surface chemistry and microstructure of substrates could induce proper cell shape and function...|$|R
40|$|Within {{the field}} of neuroprosthetics the {{possibility}} to use implanted electrodes for communication with the nervous system is explored. Much effort is put into the material aspects of the electrode implant to increase charge injection capacity, suppress foreign body response and build micro sized electrode arrays allowing close contact with neurons. Conducting polymers, in particular poly(3, 4 -ethylene dioxythiophene) (PEDOT), have been suggested as materials highly interesting for such neural communication electrodes. The possibility to tailor the material both mechanically and biochemically to suit specific applications, is a substantial benefit with polymers when compared to metals. PEDOT also have hybrid charge transfer properties, including both electronic and ionic conduction, which allow for highly efficient charge injection.   Part of this thesis describes a method of tailoring PEDOT through exchanging the counter ion used in electropolymerisation process. Commonly used surfactants can thereby be excluded and instead, different biomolecules {{can be incorporated into}} the polymer. The electrochemical characteristics of the polymer film depend on the ion. PEDOT electropolymerised with heparin was here determined to have the most advantageous properties. In vitro methods were applied to confirm non-cytotoxicity of the formed PEDOT:biomolecular composites. In addition, biocompatibility was affirmed for PEDOT:heparin by evaluation of inflammatory response and neuron density when implanted in rodent cortex.   One advantage with PEDOT often stated, is its high stability compared to other conducting polymers. A battery of tests simulating the biological environment was therefore applied to investigate this stability, and especially the influence of the incorporated heparin. These tests showed that there was a decline in the electroactivity of PEDOT over time. This also applied in phosphate <b>buffered</b> saline at <b>body</b> temperature {{and in the absence of}} other stressors. The time course of degradation also differed depending on whether the counter ion was the surfactant polystyrene sulphonate or heparin, with a slightly better stability for the former.   One possibility with PEDOT, often overlooked for biological applications, is the use of its semi conducting properties in order to include logic functions in the implant. This thesis presents the concept of using PEDOT electrochemical transistors to construct textile electrode arrays with in-built multiplexing. Using the electrolyte mediated interaction between adjacent PEDOT coated fibres to switch the polymer coat between conducting and non conducting states, then transistor function can be included in the conducting textile. Analogue circuit simulations based on experimentally found transistor characteristics proved the feasibility of these textile arrays. Developments of better polymer coatings, electrolytes and encapsulation techniques for this technology, were also identified to be essential steps in order to make these devices truly useful.   In summary, this work shows the potential of PEDOT to improve neural interfaces in several ways. Some weaknesses of the polymer and the polymer electronics are presented and this, together with the epidemiological data, should point in the direction for future studies within this field.
