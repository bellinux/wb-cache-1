40|$|A common finding when {{measuring}} T cell {{immunity to}} enteric bacterial vaccines in humans {{is the presence}} of <b>background</b> <b>responses</b> among individuals before immunization. Yet the nature of these <b>background</b> <b>responses</b> remains largely unknown. Recent findings show the presence in uninfected individuals of mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells that mount broad spectrum immune responses against a variety of microorganisms including Mycobacterium tuberculosis and enteric bacteria such as E. coli and Salmonella. Therefore, we investigated whether MAIT immune responses to intestinal bacteria might account for the <b>background</b> <b>responses</b> observed before immunization. Here we measured MAIT immune responses to commensal and enteric pathogenic bacteria in healthy individuals with no history of oral immunization with enteric bacteria. We found that MAIT cells were activated by B cells infected with various bacteria strains (commensals and pathogens from the Enterobacteriaceae family, but not by uninfected cells. These responses were restricted by the non-classical MHC-related molecule 1 (MR 1) and involved the endocytic pathway. The quality of these responses (i. e., cytokine profile) was dependent on bacterial load but not on the level expression of MR 1 or bacterial antigen on B cell surface, suggesting that a threshold level of MR 1 expression is required to trigger MAIT activation. These results provide important insights into the role of B cells as a source of antigen presenting cells to MAIT cells and the gut immune surveillance of commensal microbiota...|$|R

Although the most recent techniques allow a sensitive and specific detection of the cellular immune response, a consensus on the best strategy to assess their magnitude and breadth {{is yet to be}} reached. Within the AIDS Vaccine Integrated Project (AVIP [URL] we developed an antigen scanning strategy combining the empirical-based approach of overlapping peptides with a vast array of database information. This new system, termed Variable Overlapping Peptide Scanning Design (VOPSD), was used for preparing two peptide sets encompassing the candidate HIV- 1 vaccine antigens Tat and Nef. Validation of the VOPSD strategy was obtained by direct comparison with 15 mer or 20 mer peptide sets in a trial involving six laboratories of the AVIP consortium. Cross-reactive <b>background</b> <b>responses</b> were measured in 80 HIV seronegative donors (HIV-), while sensitivity and magnitude of Tat and Nef-specific T-cell responses were assessed on 90 HIV+ individuals. In HIV-, VOPSD peptides generated <b>background</b> <b>responses</b> comparable with those of the standard sets. In HIV- 1 + individuals the VOPSD pools showed a higher sensitivity in detecting individual responses (Tat VOPSD vs. Tat 15 mers or 20 mers: p ≤ 0. 01) as well as in generating stronger responses (Nef VOPSD vs. Nef 20 mers: p < 0. 001) than standard sets, enhancing both CD 4 and CD 8 T-cell responses. Moreover, this peptide design allowed a marked reduction of the peptides number, representing a powerful tool for investigating novel HIV- 1 candidate vaccine antigens in cohorts of HIV-seronegative and seropositive individuals. © 2011 Elsevier B.

This is supported by findings that activity in extrastriate cortex is suppressed when several stimuli are presented simultaneously, compared to a single stimulus. In this study, we randomly varied the number of simultaneously presented figures (set size) in an attention-demanding change detection task, while we recorded multiunit activity in striate cortex (V 1) in monkeys. After figure-background segregation, activity was suppressed as set size increased. This effect was stronger and started earlier among cells stimulated by the background than those stimulated by the figures themselves. As a consequence, contextual modulation, a correlate of figure-background segregation, increased with set size, approximately 100 msec after its initial generation.

40|$|Intact and chromatically spinal {{sectioned}} minnows {{of known}} background histories; {{were exposed to}} illuminated white and black backgrounds for 2 months. A definite skin area was photographed and the melanophores lost and formed in it were recorded. Loss and formation of melanophores occurred simultaneously in intact minnows whether placed on a white or on a black background although their relative numbers were very different in the two situations and depended largely on previous background histories. After chromatic spinal section, the loss of melanophores was reduced and formation increased in minnows on a white background, whereas the reverse was observed in minnows on a black background, these results followed irrespective of difference in background histories. two conclusions are drawn from the results. Firstly, that the chromatic nerve fibres play a significant part in 'morphological' colour changes of the minnow. Secondly, that a dineuroic control is involved. It is suggested that the pigment-aggregated transmitter substance promotes loss of melanophores and limits their formation and that the pigment-dispersing transmitter promotes their formation and limits their loss. In {{the second set of}} experiments minnows were exposed on a black background for varying periods to allow melanophore formation, the ages and time of appearance of melanophores were photographically determined. The <b>background</b> <b>responses</b> of the newly formed melanophores were assessed microscopically in fixed preparations of animals killed in at different time-intervals. The results were interpreted according to the generally accepted belief that slow and rapid colour changes indicate hormonal and nervous mediation respectively.

Three-dimensional (3 D) finite difference time domain (FDTD) forward modelling is used to find correspondence between subsurface resistivity structures and measured data, and also to evaluate CSEM sensitivity and timelapse anomalies. The electric field magnitudes measured above the proven HC reservoirs offshore Angola are 1. 5 – 3 times higher compared to the synthetic <b>background</b> <b>responses</b> and “off-reservoir” measurements, while the responses above a salt structure is > 3 times stronger compared to the <b>background</b> <b>responses.</b> The CSEM anomaly observed at Modgunn arch, corresponding to high-resistivity sills 1100 m below the seabed, is 2. 5 times stronger compared to the <b>background</b> <b>responses.</b> The CSEM data measured above the TWGP (2. 7 times stronger compared to “offreservoir” measurements), also indicate subsurface HCs. CSEM responses obtained from forward modelling, based on seismic and petrophysical data, show good agreement to the measured responses. Combined use of seismic, petrophysical and CSEM data improves the subsurface interpretation. Additionally, introduction of non-HC related high-resistivity structures, such as salt bodies, igneous sills and shallow resistors within the geo-resistivity model improves the subsurface interpretation. Fine grid (1 x 1 km) acquisition geometry, irrespective of source orientation, provides precise definition of CSEM anomalies. Broadside data in grid geometry increase the data density (up to the factor of 3) and hence improve the CSEM attribute resolution. Source orientation oblique to the strike of an elongated resistor provides better structural definition for a coarse-grid geometry. A multiresistor anomaly is not simply the summation but a cumulative response with mutual interference between the constituent resistors. A gradual inverse variation of offset and frequency allows differentiation of CSEM anomalies for multilayered resistors. Similar frequency-offset variations for laterally persistent highresistivity facies show visual continuity with varying geometric expressions. 3 D grid-modelling facilitates mapping of time-lapse CSEM anomalies. The time-lapse CSEM anomaly {{is not a simple}} function of the volumetric resistance, but the combined effect of variables associated with volumetric resistance including diameter, thickness, aspect ratio and resistivity. A 100 % lateral expansion of a 1500 m wide CO 2 plume results in 41 % time-lapse anomaly, while a 300 % vertical expansion of a 50 m thick plume gives only 7 % anomaly. A typical HC reservoir (80 Wm) at 1000 m below seafloor gives 40 % time-lapse anomaly when 5 % of its reserve is replaced by brine. The un-drained compartments in a HC reservoir provide CSEM anomalies comparable to the baseline responses and hence the un-drained compartment may be detected by CSEM repeat surveying, given that the compartment diameter is comparable to the skin depth for the EM signal used.
