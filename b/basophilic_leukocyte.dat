40|$|A {{variety of}} cell-mediated {{hypersensitivity}} reactions in experimental animals include a prominent infiltrate of <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes.</b> This form of reactivity {{has been designated}} cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity and is favored when sensitization to several types of antigen is accomplished {{without the use of}} complete Freund's adjuvant. A similar type of hypersensitivity response was sought in man using morphologic techniques which permit identification of <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes.</b> Eight individuals with allergic contact dermatitis to a variety of allergens were studied and six of these developed typical contact reactions with erythema, edema, and epidermal vesicles. The microscopic findings in 3 -day biopsies from these individuals differed significantly from classic descriptions of tuberculin hypersensitivity and showed, in addition to mononuclear cells and the characteristic epidermal changes, a substantial infiltrate of <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes</b> and evidence of altered vascular permeability with vascular compaction, dermal edema, and fibrin deposition. Serial biopsies from one individual permitted analysis of the microscopic pathology as it unfolded at successive intervals after patch test. The initial lesion consisted of perivascular accumulations of lymphocytes; this was followed by an influx of basophils and, subsequently, of eosinophils. These findings associate contact allergy in man with the parallel reactions of cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity in animals and provide further evidence for the heterogeneity of the cellular immune response. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that interaction between sensitized lymphocytes and antigen, at a local test site, is responsible for the attraction of basophils. They also directly implicate the clotting system in delayed-type reactions and suggest the possibility of a synergistic relationship between cellular immunity and reactions mediated by basophil-bound, homocytotrophic antibody...|$|R
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{governing the}} development of local immunity in experimental dermatophytosis were studied by injecting intravenously trichophytin in guinea pigs cured of a prior Trichophyton mentagrophytes infestation. Dermal cell modifications were observed which were greater in the healed zones than in those not affected during the prior dermatophyte inoculation. These modifications included lymphocyte activation and accumulation and an accumulation of <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes.</b> These observations suggest that after an acute dermatophyte infection heals, immunocompetent cells remain which are more numerous at the sites of lesions and that these cells {{would be responsible for}} the increased rate of elimination of the fungus during a reinfection. This hypothesis is discussed in the framework of the relationships observed in dermatophyte infections between delayed type hypersensitivity and resistance...|$|R

40|$|A {{well-established}} {{expression of}} cell-mediated immunity has {{been separated from}} classical tuberculin type delayed hypersensitivity. Originally called "Jones Mote " sensitivity (1), it has been renamed cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) (2) to emphasize {{the large numbers of}} <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes</b> that infiltrate the dermis in the skin lesions. Both conditions can be distinguished as well by differences in immunogenic (3) and tolerogenic (4) requirements, as well as persistence of sensitivity. Both expressions of cell-mediated, delayed-in-onset type hypersensitivity reactions (DH and CBH) have been thought to be mediated by sensitized thymusderived (T) lymphocytes, but recent studies implicate antigen specific B cells as either effectors of CBH (5) or view CBH as a product of a classical delayed reaction modified by suppressor B cells (6). To further investigate the role of T and B cells in the mediation of CBH, we took advantage of artificial antigens, the response to which is known to be controlled by histocompatibility-linked immune response genes (7). In th...|$|R
40|$|Most {{differentiated}} {{cells are}} influenced {{by a variety of}} chemical signals which bind to specific surface receptors. How such ligand-membrane interactions are transduced into intracellular signals which modify cell behavior is a central biological question. The degranulation and consequent release of histamine from mast cells when antigen or anti-immunoglobulin (Ig) antibody binds to cytophilic antibody (mainly IgE) bound to Fc receptors on the mast cell surface (reviewed in ref. 1), provides an unusually accessible model for studying this transducing function of the plasma membrane. Among the attractions of the peritoneal mast cell system are the relative ease of preparing purified single cell suspensions (2), the fact that degranulation follows within seconds of ligand binding (3), and that one can use labeled anti-Ig antibodies or antigen to follow the interaction of ligand with the relevant transducing membrane receptors during the signaling process. Blood <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes,</b> which also release histamine following antigen or anti-IgE binding (1), as yet cannot be easily purified and require many minutes for maximal degranulation (4) ...|$|R
40|$|Delayed {{hypersensitivity}} {{has generally}} been regarded as a homogeneous group of reactions including reactivity to proteins such as tuberculin, contact allergy, resistance to infection with viruses and other microorganisms, and allograft rejection (1). Recently, however, {{we have found that}} several forms of delayed-onset cellmediated hypersensitivity in animals are characterized by an extensive infiltration of <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes</b> (2). Such reactions have been designated cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity or CBH 1 to distinguish them from true delayed hypersensitivity (DH) in which basophils are infrequent or altogether absent. In many instances, both forms of reactivity may be elicited to the same antigen, depending on the mode of immunization, and CBH is favored when sensitization to protein antigens (2 - 4), contact allergens (4, 5), a virus (6), or allografts (7) is accomplished without the use of complete Freund's adiuvant. While CBH reactions to protein antigens are often transient and of the Jones-Mote type (3), in other instances, as with contact allergy and viral immunity, the characteristic basophil response persists for weeks or months (4, 6). In addition to differences in morphology and requirements for immunization...|$|R
40|$|Histidine decarboxylase (HisDCase, EC 4. 1. 1. 22) {{activity}} in mouse skin increased {{by a factor}} of more than 10 after a single application of phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate. The cell type that was responsible for the increase in HisDCase activity was examined by using (WB X C 57 BL/ 6) F 1 -W/Wv mice, which are genetically deficient in tissue mast cells. In contrast to a report that increase of ornithine decarboxylase (EC 4. 1. 1. 17) activity occurs in the epidermis [O'Brien, T. G., Simisiman, R. C. & Boutwell, R. K. (1975) Cancer Res. 35, 2426 - 2433], the HisDCase activity was found to increase in the dermis. Although most of the histamine in the dermis was present in mast cells, the increase in HisDCase {{activity in}} the skin in W/Wv mice was comparable with that in congeneic +/+ mice. This increase of HisDCase activity in the skin of W/Wv mice was abolished by prior x-ray irradiation (800 rads; 1 rad = 0. 01 gray) but was restored by subsequent bone marrow transplantation. Because mice, in general, are known to lack <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes,</b> the present results suggest the existence of histamine-producing cells without basophilic granules that are derived from the bone marrow...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{studies of}} the {{histology}} of allergic contact dermatitis reactions to potent allergens in guinea pigs and humans have indicated that there is significant tissue infiltration with <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes.</b> In this study we determined whether this histologic finding could be of value in distinguishing weak sensitization reactions from primary irritation, thereby aiding in the predictive identification of weak or moderate contact allergens. Guinea pigs were sensitized by the Buehler test method. Skin reactions were graded 24, 48, and 72 h post-challenge with duplicate patch sites biopsied at the 24 - or 72 -h grading timepoints. The biopsies were fixed, embedded in glycol methacrylate, thin sectioned, and Giemsa stained. The number of basophils per 400 leukocytes were counted along the upper dermis just below the dermal/ epidermal junction. Challenge patch sites from animals sensitized to a relatively low dose of the strong contact allergen, oxazolone, were compared with patch sites from animals challenged only with a strong irritant, sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS). Compared to normal skin (7. 5 ± 1. 0 basophils/ 400 leukocytes ± SEM) only the oxazolone patch sites showed significant basophil infiltration (36. 8 ± 6. 5), {{despite the fact that}} the skin reactions to the low oxazolone challenge dose were relatively weak. SLS patch sites showed no basophil infiltration above normal skin levels (4. 8 ± 0. 9). Subsequent blinded studies compared weak/moderate presumptive sensitization reactions (as defined by accepted visual skin grading criteria) to various chemicals (citronellal, vanillin, cinnamic aldehyde, and ethylenediamine) to primary irritation reactions to the same chemicals...|$|R
40|$|Changes of basophils in {{peripheral}} blood {{were observed in}} 201 patients with bronchial asthma. And this study {{is concerned with the}} threshold of asthmatic attack indicated by basophils and the relationship between basophils and reagin-type antibody-antigen reaction. The results show that the basophils increase before the attack in an episode of asthmatic attack. The threshold of asthmatic attack indicated by basophil count of 65 /cmm is very significant for the observation of asthmatic attack, and it is possible to expect a next attack in the pre-attack stage, if the basophil tends to increase over this value. And this threshold of asthmatic attack was constant in individual cases. These changes of basophils were similar in the cases given steroid hormone. In eosinophils these changes were not so clear-cut. In a prolonged therapeutic course basophils in bronchial asthma were shown over the threshold in the stage of repeated asthmatic attacks, and lower in the non-attack stage reflecting the therapeutic effect. It was also found that basophils increased clearly in patients with sea-squirt asthma who showed positive Prausnitz-Kustner reaction. This result indicates that there is a close relation between basophils and reaginic antibody-antigen reaction. The action of heparin contained in basophils concerned with the mechanism of allergic reaction of reagin-type was examined. And it was observed that heparin suppressed the allergic reaction caused by reaginic antibody in the rat, and was an antagonist for histamine. Therefore, it was considered that one of the roles of <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes</b> is to repair the reaction of reagin-type allergy...|$|R
40|$|Delayed onset {{erythematous}} skin reactions elicited in {{guinea pigs}} {{early in the}} course of sensitization with azobenzenearsonate-protein conjugates or with protein antigens in incomplete Freund's adjuvant or in saline were found to have a characteristic morphology which sets them apart from delayed hypersensitivity and the classic antibody mediated reactions. The principle feature was massive dermal infiltration with <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes.</b> Mononuclear cells of several types including activated and small lymphocytes, monocytes, macrophages, and blast cells were also present. Such reactions have in the past been designated Jones-Mote hypersensitivity, but we prefer the descriptive term cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity (CBH) for the reasons given. Occasional basophils extruded their granules, and individual granules, retaining their characteristic ultrastructure, were commonly seen in the interstitium. However, intercellular junctions between endothelial cells were closed except during cell emigration and there was no morphologic evidence of an histamine-like effect. The majority of basophils, moreover, did not degranulate but underwent nuclear pyknosis and cytoplasmic degeneration and were phagocytosed by macrophages. Phagocytosed basophil granules retained their ultrastructure. Skin tests performed at late intervals after sensitization had a different time course and morphology. Animals sensitized with protein antigens in complete Freund's adjuvant developed delayed hypersensitivity; however, reactions elicited in such animals at early (but not late) intervals after sensitization contained a prominent basophil component. We interpret such reactions to be a mixture of delayed hypersensitivity and cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity. The function of the basophil in CBH and its relation to the mononuclear cells which accompany it are unknown, and various possibilities are discussed. We conclude that cutaneous basophil hypersensitivity is a distinct immunologic and morphologic entity, occurring early {{in the course of}} sensitization with protein antigens incorporated in any of several vehicles. The mechanism of the reaction is presently unknown, and a general hypothesis to explain its pathogenesis has been proposed...|$|R
40|$|The morphologic events {{associated}} with the immunologic rejection by strain 2 guinea pigs of ascites variants of two lines of diethylnitrosamine-induced tumors have been studied by light and electron microscopy. Tumor injection sites in the skin of control animals exhibited clusters of viable, actively mitotic tumor cells along with a modest inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, and rare basophils. In contrast, similar injections of either tumor line in specifically sensitized guinea pigs elicited typical delayed-type skin reactions {{associated with}} tumor cell necrosis and a more extensive inflammatory infiltrate including a selective {{increase in the number}} of <b>basophilic</b> <b>leukocytes</b> (12 %, line 1, or 23 %, line 10, of total inflammatory cells). That basophils may have a role in tumor resistance in vivo is suggested by the close anatomic associations observed between basophils and tumor cells, and by the fact that basophils were the only inflammatory cell to demonstrate a relative increase in frequency in the lesions of sensitized as compared with control animals. Moreover, intraperitoneal injection of line 1 tumor in specifically sensitized animals elicited a striking basophilia within 24 h. Unlike macrophages, basophils did not phagocytose tumor cells but did evidence occasional extrusion of granules and frequently exhibited loss of granule staining density, a change that may be related to release of mediator substances. Electron microscope studies of line 1 tumor rejection in the peritoneal cavities of specifically sensitized guinea pigs demonstrated aggregations of "activated" macrophages, lymphocytes, basophils, and damaged or dead tumor cells. These aggregates, held together by complex interdigitations of macrophage villi, closely resembled those occurring in vitro among peritoneal exudate cells whose migration from capillary tubes was inhibited by migration inhibition factor (MIF). Moreover, cells in these aggregates, as well as macrophages inhibited by MIF in vitro, lacked a normal coating of cell surface material...|$|R
