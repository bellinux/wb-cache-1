5000|$|In 1909, Wilhelm Kroll {{graduated}} from Luxembourg’s Athenaeum High School, and in 1910, he registered at {{the faculty of}} metallurgy at the Technische Hochschule Charlottenburg in Berlin, graduating in 1914. He spent {{the next four years}} there to complete his doctoral thesis under the guidance of legendary professor K. A. Hofmann. Working in Germany, in 1918, Kroll invented a very efficient <b>bearing</b> <b>alloy</b> based on lead, commercialized under the name Lurgi metal and he was awarded various metallurgy related patents. In Austria in 1922, he developed alloys known as Alusil and Alsia used primarily for cast-aluminum pistons. In 1923, Kroll returned to Luxembourg and set up a private laboratory. Kroll invented precipitation hardening (PH) stainless steel in 1929, when he added a small amount of titanium to stainless steel and strengthened it by thermally precipitating TiC particles. [...] In the 1930s he began focusing on the study of titanium and its alloys. Before Kroll, titanium as a metal was a laboratory curiosity. In 1938, titanium was machined {{for the first time at}} the Cerametal factory in Bereldange, Luxembourg. William Kroll visited the USA arriving in New York aboard the SS Queen Mary from Cherbourg, France on October 18, 1938. He called on various US non-ferrous industries, showing his titanium samples, but there was little to no interest in titanium at the time. Disappointed, he returned to Luxembourg. As the Nazi cloud began to spread over Germany in 1940 Wilhelm J. Kroll elected to emigrate to the United States. He arrived in New York on February 22, 1940, having sailed from Rotterdam, The Netherlands aboard the SS Volendam on February 10, 1940. On May 10, 1940, German troops invaded Luxembourg, occupying the country for the next four years.|$|E

The tribological evaluation included ion nitrided, pack borided, laser borided, quenched and tempered surface layers and TiB 2 coating deposited on 38 CrAlMo 5 - 10, 46 Cr 2 and 30 MnB 4 steels.

The applied steel surface layer modification with boron allow creating surface layers with pre-determined tribological characteristics required for the elements of kinematic pairs operating in the conditions of sliding friction.

40|$|In {{a textile}} mill the {{spinning}} machine's ring frame comprises of a ring and a traveller. The yarn is twisted {{with the help}} of a traveller and is winded on the bobbin with the dual support of a ring and the traveller. The traveller is dragged along behind by the spindle even though it doesn’t have a drive on its own. During winding the centrifugal force generates high contact pressure between the ring and the traveller. This pressure results in the internal surface degradation of the ring which further affects its working life. The main aim of this study was to augment the working life of the ring in order to depreciate the idle time required to restore the rings on the spindle repeatedly during spinning. The objective was accomplished by the means of thermal spray coatings, where the effect of the coatings on the ambit of the wear and wear characteristics of the rings were inspected.
