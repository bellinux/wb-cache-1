40|$|In present research, {{the fish}} cake was {{produced}} from <b>Big-Head</b> <b>Carp</b> Artichthys nobilis based three formulations {{and according to}} organoleptic tests best formula was chosen including 65 % of fish flesh. Then, the selected product was packed in polyethylene coverage and frozen at - 18 ˚C. For determining biochemical compositions (including nutrient compounds and fatty acids profile) and qualitative parameters (such as TVN, PV & TBA), the microbial counting (Total Count of bacteria and Psychrophilic) were carried out in specific time intervals 0, 30, 60 and 90 days. The results showed that in the samples from day 0 up to 90, amounts of TVN were reached 11. 97 ± 0. 06 to 16. 82 ± 0. 62 mg/ 100, PV from 1. 13 ± 0. 05 to 0. 54 ± 0. 06 meqO 2 /kg and TBA from 0. 51 ± 0. 01 to 0. 74 ± 0. 05 mgMDA/kg. The results of bacteria counting showed that total count decreased to 3. 20 ± 0. 17 due to freezing from 3. 52 ± 0. 02 logcfu/g and psychrophilic count Initiallyincreased andthen decreasedfrom 3. 52 ± 0. 02 to 3. 29 ± 0. 01 logcfu/g at last day which both were in acceptable range (...|$|E
40|$|Fish is {{consumed}} {{as a common}} food by humans due to its nutritional and therapeutic benefits. However, they can accumulate toxic chemicals (such as heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants) from water and food chain. Very {{few studies have been}} investigated on heavy metal contents in fish from Tibetan Autonomous Region of China. In order to study heavy metals levels in fish from aquaculture farms and evaluate the risk that human consume fish in this area, we collected four types of aquaculture fish species (6 <b>big-head</b> <b>carps,</b> 5 grass carps, 5 carps and 5 tilapias) from fisheries around Lhasa city in this study. 9 heavy metals (Cr, As, Cd, Pb, Cu, Ba, Co, Mn and V) in different tissues of fish were determined by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. Cr, Ba, Co, Mn and V could easily accumulate in the gill, and Cu was detected in the hearts of all the fishes. Toxic metal (As, Cd and Pb) contents were higher in the liver than those in other tissues, heavy metal levels were the lowest in the muscle among all tissues. Most of heavy metal concentrations in the tilapia tissues were higher than those in other fish tissues, especially arsenic. Arsenic content in the tilapia samples was similar to 2 - 4 times higher than the maximum levels (MLs) of contaminants in the national standard, and other metals were all lower than the MLs. Compared the estimated daily intake of heavy metals through fish consumption with tolerable daily intakes recommended by FAO, the metals daily intake of As, Cd and Pb from fish consumption might not pose serious health risk to the local inhabitants. It is therefore necessary to determine the dose level for human, which is considered to be taken daily over a lifetime without adverse effects...|$|R
