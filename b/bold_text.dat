2500|$|The rhetorical {{virtue of}} parrhesia appears in Midrashic {{literature}} {{as a condition}} for the transmission of Torah. Connoting open and public communication, parrhesia appears in combination with the term, [...] (dimus, short for dimosia), translated coram publica, in the public eye, i.e. open to the public As a mode of communication it is repeatedly described in terms analogous to a Commons. Parrhesia is closely associated with an ownerless wilderness of primary mytho-geographic import, the Midbar Sinai in which the Torah was initially received. The dissemination of Torah thus depends on its teachers cultivating a nature which is as open, ownerless, and sharing as that wilderness. Here is the text from the Mekhilta where the term dimus parrhesia appears (see <b>bolded</b> <b>text).</b>|$|R
