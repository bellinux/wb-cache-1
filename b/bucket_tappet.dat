50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves are {{actuated}} directly by a rocker arm, finger, or <b>bucket</b> <b>tappet.</b> Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the cam lobes contact, while pushrod engines use rocker arms.

50|$|Overhead cam engines {{were first}} {{developed}} as high performance aircraft and racing engines, with the camshafts mounted {{directly over the}} valves and driving them through a simple <b>bucket</b> <b>tappet.</b> To give the best valve position for gasflow through a crossflow cylinder head, valves were usually mounted in two rows and with two separate camshafts. These bucket tappets were usually adjusted by a small shim, either above or below the tappet. Shims were made {{in a range of}} standard thicknesses and a mechanic would swap them to change the tappet gap. The engine would first be assembled with a default shim of known thickness, then the gap measured. A set of different shims would then be installed, each one chosen according to the change needed from the measured gap to the ideal gap. The gaps would then be measured again, in case of mistakes and also in case the cam position had shifted slightly. As the camshaft had to be removed to change the shims, this was an extremely time consuming operation, especially as the precise height of the camshaft above the cylinder head could change, depending on how carefully it was re-installed.|$|E
40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of thin diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings {{have been investigated}} extensively in recent years mostly in laboratory bench tests. These coatings are known to provide significant friction reduction {{in the absence of}} lubricants. In the presence of lubricants, the friction benefits of these coatings are not clearly demonstrated. The current investigation is focused on exploring the friction reduction potential of a DLC coating obtained from a supplier in laboratory bench tests and in a motored valve train test. The DLC coating was deposited on the <b>bucket</b> <b>tappet.</b> In laboratory bench tests, results showed significant friction reduction {{in the absence of any}} lubricant but not in the presence of engine oil. In motored valve train tests a significant reduction in friction torque was observed when compared against a slightly rougher uncoated bucket, but no reduction was observed when compared against uncoated <b>bucket</b> <b>tappet</b> with comparable surface finish. Under boundary lubrication conditions, no lubricantderived surface films were present on the DLC-coated surface. However, under mixed lubrication conditions, evidence of patchy antiwear surface films could be observed on DLCcoated buckets. The antiwear film appears to be primarily composed of calcium phosphate...|$|E

Initial microwave scale-up experiments were performed using powder compacts of a <b>bucket</b> <b>tappet</b> geometry. In experiments using microwave-transparent boron nitride sample crucibles, temperature gradients within some crucibles led to larger variations in the sample densities than were obtained with the conventionally processed samples.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the project are {{the development of a}} cost-effective silicon nitride material and an economic production process for complexly shaped parts by the application of the injection-moulding process of ceramic powders. A material sinterable under normal-pressure on the basis of reaction-bonded silicon nitride (SRBSN) has been developed, using silicon - silicon nitride mixtures. For these mixtures a cost-effective and rapid nitridation process could be realized, leading to a combination in a one-step process. By application of the injection-moulding shaping process, this material could be processed to <b>bucket</b> <b>tappet</b> and crankshaft components. Already during the running time of the project, the developed material has become established as a production material. Moreover, the injection-moulding shaping rocess has been applied for the production of further technically applied silicon nitride components, requiring high precision and complex geometries. By application of injection-moulding as a 'near-netshape' process, ceramic components could be produced which meet the requirements concerning dimensional tolerances and final contour accuracy. An expensive finishing step is no longer required. (orig.)

40|$|This {{paper was}} {{published}} as Surface Engineering, 2005, 21, (1), pp. 67 - 71. It {{is available from}} [URL] Doi: 10. 1179 / 174329405 X 30039 Diamond like carbon (DLC) coatings have been investigated for application in the automotive valve train and, in particular, the camshaft drive assembly. The drive assembly can have various force transfer devices, such as an overhead <b>bucket</b> <b>tappet</b> assembly or a cam follower assembly. Force transfer devices operate in severe tribological contact situations with maximum Hertzian stresses approaching 1 GN m− 2 and temperatures in the range 100 – 150 °C. Lubrication is often partially starved and, therefore, the thermochemical properties and surface finish of the components are critical to their successful operation. For motor sport applications, DLC offers improved wear resistance over steel alone; and for passenger vehicles, the high hardness and commensurately lower friction coefficient that DLC gives against steel counterfaces offers improvements in fuel economy and lower wear. This paper presents the results from {{an investigation of the}} wear of DLC coated shims against standard production camshafts. DLC offers benefits in terms of reducing shim wear, but increases the wear of the camshaft. The wear mechanism observed for DLC is dependent on the oil type, but generally it is a pitting type mechanism. The cam wear occurs by plastic ratchetting. The consequences of the results are discussed in terms of the implementation of such coatings in standard valve train applications...|$|E

40|$|The {{requirements}} on engine components are becoming tougher. On the one hand, the load {{of the components}} is increasing due to the optimization of the engines {{to make them more}} efficient. New materials and/or coatings and surface treatments are needed to fulfill the new requirements.

In addition, there is a high demand to reduce the friction of the engine for improved fuel consumption. One-way to support this is the application of friction reduced coatings and/or surface treatments. DLC coatings seem to be a promising candidate. But what differentiates DLC coatings on the market and within different lubrication conditions in regards to friction? Standard valve train <b>bucket</b> <b>tappets</b> coated with different DLC coatings will be compared regarding friction to uncoated steel <b>bucket</b> <b>tappets</b> by using a special self build test rig.

50|$|The racing {{engine was}} {{extensively}} redesigned and the cylinder heads were {{replaced with a}} more conventional two-valve design, employing a SOHC acting directly on vertically inclined valves through <b>bucket</b> <b>tappets,</b> {{in a move that}} bore striking similarity to the cylinder head design of the contemporary Rover 2000, a similarity which is further noted in the use of a flat-cylinder head and dished 'heron' pistons of both engines. These changes greatly reduced complexity, weight, size and noise.The revised head design had restrictive and long inlet ports which sacrificed top-end power but which, along with an increase in displacement to 5.3 litres, greatly improved performance at low-mid engine speeds, which was desirable in what was planned to be a heavy luxury car. The chain-driven SOHC heads and the soft valve springs fitted to reduce valvetrain noise resulted in the redline being lowered to 6,500 rpm from the 8,000 rpm of the original quad-cam design.

5000|$|The {{original}} GS designs {{share common}} engine design elements of air-cooling, roller bearing crankshafts, two-valves per cylinder and double overhead camshafts (DOHC) operating directly on shim and <b>bucket</b> <b>tappets.</b> In 1980 {{the first major}} upgrading of the 750cc and 1000cc machines with 16-valve (four valves per cylinder) heads with the valves being actuated though short forked rockers, and the enlargement of the litre bike to 1100cc (actually 1074cc). The new heads incorporated Suzuki's Twin Swirl Combustion Chamber (TSCC) technology and machines sporting the new technology were designated as GSX models in Japan, Europe, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and many other markets, differentiating them from their two-valve per cylinder stable mates. In the Americas the GS code continued {{to be used for}} both four and two valve per cylinder machines. The 750 engine also received a plain bearing crankshaft and higher geared oil pump to increase oil pressure to the crank. The 8-valve 650cc engine also got plain bearing and marked the transition from two-stoke origins of the design and facilitated the move to air-oil cooling.|$|R

5000|$|Designed by Aurelio Lampredi, the Fiat Twin Cam (also {{known as}} the Lampredi Twin Cam) was an {{advanced}} inline-four automobile engine produced from 1966 through 2000 as a Fiat/Lancia engine until it {{was replaced by the}} [...] "family B" [...] series of engines. The engine uses the block of the OHV engine found in the Fiat 124 with some modifications to accept the belt drive for the camshafts. The head itself is made in three pieces, one carrying the combustion chamber and valves and one separate casting for each camshaft in tunnel type bearings. The valves had an included angle of 65 degrees. The engine featured a revolutionary new method for adjusting the valve clearance. Usually at that time in DOHC engines like from Alfa Romeo or Jaguar, small shims were placed on the valve stem inside the <b>bucket</b> <b>tappets,</b> thereby necessitating the removal of the camshafts to get access to these shims to adjust the valve clearance, making for time consuming and very expensive maintenance work. Lampredi’s design placed the shims on top of the tappets where they could be removed with the camshaft in situ after the tappets were pressed down with a special tool. This design was patented for Fiat and was used in the engines of the 128 and 130, and even the (Ferrari/Fiat) Dino V6 engine was converted to this system.The engine was produced in a large number of displacements, ranging from 1,297 cc to 1,995 cc and was used in Fiat, Lancia, Alfa Romeo, SEAT and Morgan cars.|$|R
