5|$|In 135 BC, {{war broke}} out when Minyue invaded Nanyue. Zhao Mo, the king of Nanyue, asked for and {{received}} the military assistance of the Han. In 180 BC, Zhao had offered to submit as a vassal and the Han agreed, a decision that was partly based on Zhao's ancestral roots in northern China. An army led by the generals Wang Hui and Han Anguo was ordered to invade Minyue. The campaign was cut short by palace infighting in the Minyue court. Panicked at news of an invasion, the younger brother of the Minyue king Zou Ying, Zou Yushan, conspired with the royal court to depose Ying. Yushan killed his <b>brother</b> <b>with</b> a spear, decapitated the corpse, and sent the head to Wang. The Han forces withdrew soon after.|$|E

5|$|Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels is a 1986 side-scrolling, {{platform}} {{video game}} developed {{and published by}} Nintendo as the first sequel to their 1985 bestseller Super Mario Bros. The games are similar in style and gameplay, apart from a steep increase in difficulty. Like the original, Mario or Luigi venture to rescue the Princess from Bowser. Unlike the original, the game has no two-player option and Luigi is differentiated from his twin plumber <b>brother</b> <b>with</b> reduced ground friction and increased jump height. The Lost Levels also introduces setbacks such as poison mushroom power-ups, counterproductive level warps, and mid-air wind gusts. The game has 32 levels across eight worlds, and five bonus worlds.|$|E

5|$|Hesketh was educated, {{along with}} his younger brother Charles, at Trinity College, Oxford. Although Charles was a studious young man, who planned to enter the church on graduation, Peter had an active social life in both Oxford and London. He holidayed in {{southern}} resorts including St Leonards-on-Sea, a new development in Sussex, where he admired the work of architect James Burton. He became close friends with Burton's son Decimus, who was also an architect. The two men {{were involved in the}} formation of London's Athenaeum Club and Burton designed the club's building in Pall Mall. Hesketh received his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1823 and his Master of Arts degree in 1826. That same year, he married Eliza Debonnaire Metcalfe, the daughter of Sir Theophilus Metcalfe, 2nd Baronet, commonly known by her middle name. Debonnaire's father gave the couple a house in Dover, but they also spent time at the Rossall estate. The couple were very close to Charles and his new wife Anna, and their sister Anna, and her husband Thomas Knowlys. Charles was ordained in 1828 and as patron of St Chad's Church in Poulton-le-Fylde, Peter presented his <b>brother</b> <b>with</b> that curacy.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, al-Muwaffaq {{also had to}} confront the {{challenge}} posed by the ambitious governor of Egypt, Ahmad ibn Tulun. The son of a Turkish slave, Ibn Tulun had been the province's governor since the reign of al-Mu'tazz, and expanded his power further in 871, when he expelled the caliphal fiscal agent and assumed direct control of Egypt's revenue, which he used to create an army of ghilman of his own. Exploiting the rift between the increasingly powerless Caliph and his <b>brother</b> <b>with</b> demonstrations {{of support for the}} former, and relying on his powerful army, Ibn Tulun managed to gain control over Syria and the frontier zone with the Byzantine Empire (the Thughur). By 882, he governed as a de facto independent ruler, adding his own name to the coins alongside the names of the Caliph and his heir. Al-Muwaffaq tried to counter Ibn Tulun's advances by naming the trusted Musa ibn Bugha as governor of Egypt, but lack of funds foiled his plans, allowing Ibn Tulun to consolidate his power in the west. In 882, al-Mu'tamid tried to escape from Samarra to seek sanctuary with Ibn Tulun, but was apprehended and placed under effective house arrest. This event opened the rift between Ibn Tulun and al-Muwaffaq even further. Ibn Tulun tried to declare jihad against the regent, and the latter had curses against the Tulunid read in the mosques across the Caliphate. After Ibn Tulun's death in 884, al-Muwaffaq attempted again to retake control of Egypt from Ibn Tulun's successor Khumarawayh. Khumarawayh however defeated an expedition under Abu'l-Abbas, and extended his control over most of the Jazira and Cilicia as well. In 886, al-Muwaffaq was forced to recognize the Tulunids as governors over Egypt and Syria for 30 years, in exchange for an annual tribute of 300,000 gold dinars.|$|E
