We construct an integrated research model based on the Diffusion of Innovations theory, institutional economics and the Technology-Organization-Environment framework. Using qualitative data from in-depth interviews, we link constructs to theory and assess their impact on each use case. Doing so we can depict the dynamic relations between different <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> and the energy sector.

40|$|In this paper, {{we engage}} in a {{philosophical}} investigation of how <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> such as cryptocurrencies can mediate our social world. Emerging blockchain-based decentralised applications {{have the potential to}} transform our financial system, our bureaucracies and models of governance. We construct an ontological framework of “narrative technologies” that allows us to show how these technologies, like texts, can configure our social reality. Drawing from the work of Ricoeur and responding to the works of Searle, in postphenomenology and STS, we show how <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> bring about a process of emplotment: an organisation of characters and events. First, we show how <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> actively configure plots such as financial transactions by rendering them increasingly rigid. Secondly, we show how they configure abstractions from the world of action, by replacing human interactions with automated code. Third, we investigate the role of people’s interpretative distances towards blockchain technologies: discussing the importance of greater public involvement with their application in different realms of social life...|$|R

40|$|Cryptocurrencies and blockchains are {{increasingly}} used, implemented and adapted for numerous purposes; people and businesses are integrating these technologies into their practices and strategies, creating new political economies and spaces {{in and of}} everyday life. This thesis seeks to develop a foundation of geographic theory {{for the study of}} spatial production within and surrounding <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> focusing on acute studies of Bitcoin as cryptocurrency, Ethereum as digital marketplace, and their conditions of possibility as decentralized autonomous organizations. Utilizing concepts from Henri Lefebvre 2 ̆ 7 s Production of Space, this thesis situates <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> within the wider discussion about the political economy of modes of spatial production, dialectical material methods, code/space, and network society through an examination of human and machine relations within their unique and emergent spaces. Combining phenomenological and dialectical material methods with the methodological practice of discourse analysis and systems theory, this thesis explores an understanding of how systemic mechanisms and actant actions driving <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> are indications of new evolutions in our conceptions of space and place in everyday life of later informational capitalism...|$|R

40|$|Bitcoin (BTC) {{is often}} cited as Libertarian. However, the <b>technology</b> {{underpinning}} Bitcoin, <b>blockchain,</b> has properties that make it ideally suited to Socialist paradigms. Current literature supports the Libertarian viewpoint {{by focusing on the}} ability of Bitcoin to bypass central authority and provide anonymity; rarely is there an examination of <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology’s</b> capacity for decentralised transparency and auditability in support of a Socialist model. This paper conducts a review of the blockchain, Libertarianism, and Socialist philosophies. It then explores Socialist models of public ownership and looks at the unique cooperative properties of blockchain that make the technology ideal for supporting Socialist societies. In summary, this paper argues that <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> are not just a Libertarian tool, they also enhance Socialist forms of governance...|$|R

50|$|Until 2012 the <b>blockchain</b> <b>technology</b> {{underlying}} the first cryptocurrency - bitcoin (bitcoin) - was mostly {{considered as a}} revolutionary payment instrument.

30|$|Smart {{contracts}} {{are considered the}} silver bullet needed by the blockchain for automating microgrid interactions. The public blockchain platform, Ethereum [61], provides a built-in Turing-complete language (which is proved to solve any problem exactly if provided with sufficient time and storage space) for programming automated applications based on smart contracts. In practice, smart contract-aided <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> have shown disruptive potentials for securing decentralized energy management in ADN [62, 63]. A real-life peer-to-peer market for renewable energy trading was experimented in New York in April 2016, where the excess energy produced by solar panels was recorded securely on blockchain and traded with neighboring residents automatically via smart contracts. Accordingly, the integration of smart contracts with <b>blockchain</b> <b>technologies</b> presents a promising ADN strategy for optimizing and automating decentralized energy management (i.e., effected by MGMCs), while preserving the integrity and trustworthiness of data exchanges among MGMCs.|$|R
