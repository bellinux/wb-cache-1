5|$|First {{described}} scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the <b>bay</b> <b>bolete</b> was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, and it {{is still}} listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended from a common ancestor), and the <b>bay</b> <b>bolete</b> is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I.badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European studies have demonstrated that the mushroom can bioaccumulate some trace metals from the soil, such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had 137Cs concentrations several times greater than those collected before the incident.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>bay</b> <b>bolete</b> is {{predominantly}} a mycorrhizal species, {{it does have}} some saprophytic tendencies and {{may be able to}} use this lifestyle in certain circumstances. The ectomycorrhizae formed between I.badia and spruce (Picea abies) have active hyphal sheaths and a higher potential to store nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, iron, and zinc than other mycorrhizal types, indicating the fungus is well adapted to acidic stands and its mycorrhizae are very efficient in uptake and storage of macronutrients. Mycorrhizae with Monterey pine (Pinus radiata) have also been described.|$|E
5|$|Often {{considered}} a poor {{relation of the}} cep (Boletus edulis), the <b>bay</b> <b>bolete</b> is nevertheless highly regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors such as Carluccio. In central Mexico, it is collected from Izta-Popo Zoquiapan National Park and sold in neighbouring markets. It may cause an allergic reaction in some people, and the blue discolouration upon bruising can be offputting, although the staining disappears from white flesh when it is cooked. The flavour is milder than its better-known relative. Younger specimens are best for eating, though more mature ones can be suitable for cutting up and drying. The tendency for the pores to absorb water means that wiping rather than washing is recommended before use in the kitchen. Unlike most boletes, I.badia can be eaten raw (though only young mushrooms should be used). Otherwise it can be fried in butter, or used with meat or fish recipes. Mushrooms can also be frozen, dried, or pickled in cider vinegar, wine, or extra virgin olive oil, and later used in sauces or soups.|$|E

50|$|Beech and, to {{a lesser}} extent, pine are the {{predominant}} trees growing on the muschelkalk soil of the Bleicherode Hills. Amongst the many rare {{plant and animal species}} are 14 native species of orchid. It is also the northernmost location for the juneberry. In addition there is a very interesting group of rare mixed wood species like limes and Scots elms as well as a large a population of yews. Amongst the species of fungi occurring here are: king <b>boletes,</b> <b>bay</b> <b>boletes</b> and St. George's mushrooms. Roe deer and wild boar, red fox, hare, great spotted and green woodpeckers and the rare red kite have also made their home in this protected area.|$|R
5000|$|Young {{specimens}} of X. chrysenteron {{often have a}} dark, dry surface, and tomentose caps which might easily be mistaken for <b>Bay</b> <b>Boletes</b> B. badius. When fully expanded, caps are 4 to 10 cm (1.6-4 in) in diameter with very little substance and thin flesh that turns a blue color when slightly cut or bruised. Caps mature to convex and plane in old age. Cracks in the mature cap reveal {{a thin layer of}} light red flesh below the skin.The 10 to 15 mm-diameter stems have no ring, are bright yellow and the lower part is covered in coral-red fibrils and has a constant elliptical to fusiform diameter throughout its length of 4 to 8 cm tall. [...] The cream-colored stem flesh turns blue when cut.X. chrysenteron has large, yellow, angular pores, and produces an olive brown spore print.|$|R
5|$|The <b>bay</b> <b>bolete</b> {{was first}} named as Boletus castaneus ß badius (i.e. a {{subspecies}} of Boletus castaneus) by Elias Magnus Fries in 1818. Fries later renamed it as {{a variety of}} Boletus castaneus in 1828, before assigning it distinct species status in his 1832 work Elenchus Fungorum. The fungus has been transferred to several genera in its taxonomic history: Rostkovites by Petter Karsten in 1881; Viscipellis and Ixocomus by Lucien Quélet in 1886 and 1888, respectively; and Suillus by Otto Kuntze in 1898. In 1931, Edouard-Jean Gilbert reclassified it in the genus Xerocomus, and many sources still list it thus. Review of Xerocomus strongly suggested it was polyphyletic, and the genus was not accepted by some mycologists. The stickiness of its wet cap distinguishes the species from others classified in Xerocomus, and hence it was left in Boletus until Alfredo Vizzini placed it in its own genus in 2014. Genetic analysis published in 2013 shows that Imleria badia is related to B.pallidus and B.glabellus; the three species form a clade known informally as the badius clade within a larger group (informally called anaxoboletus) in the suborder Boletineae. Other clades within the group include the Tylopilus, porcini (= Boletus sensu stricto) and Strobilomyces clades, {{as well as two}} other groups composed of members of various genera including Xerocomus (the taxa designated as Xerocomus species in this clade are not Xerocomus species and require new taxonomic designations) and Xerocomellus.|$|E

In autumn 2008, in the area in question, 31 permanent trial plots were established, aligned within a regular net of squares, with dimensions of 1500 × 1500 m. The trial plots were located to the north-east and to the east of the emitter (the HCMŚ zinc mine), accordingly with the direction of prevailing winds. In September 2013, and September and October 2014, sporocarps of <b>bay</b> <b>bolete</b> (Xerocomus badius (Fr.) E.) were collected from the trial plots. The analyses performed for the material gathered covered a determination of heavy metal content in mushrooms (Zn, Pb and Cd), using a method of inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy ICP-AES. This paper aimed to establish the accumulation levels of selected heavy metals (Zn, Pb and Cd) in <b>bay</b> <b>bolete</b> growing in forests of the Brynica sub-district, in the Świerklaniec Forest District, and the correlation between their content in soil and in the mushrooms under scrutiny.

40|$|The radiocaesium {{activity}} concentration may still remain high in natural {{products such as}} game meat, wild mushrooms, and forest berries even {{more than two decades}} after the Chernobyl accident. The results of regular control studies of game meat conducted in Poland showed wild boars as the most contaminated game animals. It is well documented that some mushrooms, readily consumed by animals, show high ability to accumulate caesium radioisotopes. <b>Bay</b> <b>bolete,</b> one of the most wide-spread mushroom species in Poland, reveals a unique radiocaesium accumulation feature. Moreover, deer truffle, containing also particularly high levels of radiocaesium, could be another radionu-clide source for wild boars. Furthermore, animals consuming deer truffles could digest contaminated soil components. Among 94 wild boar meat samples analysed in 2008 – 2009, two exceeded the permitted level. Hence, some precautions should be taken in the population with an elevated intake of wild boar meat. Moreover, since each hunted wild boar is examined for the presence of Trichinella larvae, regular measurements of radiocaesium concentrations in these animals may be advisable for enhancing consumer safety...|$|E
