5|$|Heathenry, also termed Heathenism or Germanic Neopaganism, is {{a modern}} Pagan religion. Scholars of {{religious}} studies classify Heathenry as a new religious movement. Its practitioners model their faith on the pre-Christian <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> adhered to by the Germanic peoples of Iron Age and Early Medieval Europe. To reconstruct these past <b>belief</b> <b>systems,</b> Heathenry uses surviving historical, archaeological, and folkloric evidence as a basis, although approaches to this material vary considerably.|$|E
5|$|After abandoning Kriya yoga, Salinger tried Dianetics (the {{forerunner of}} Scientology), even meeting its founder L. Ron Hubbard, but {{according}} to Claire he was quickly disenchanted with it.

5|$|Concern {{with the}} harm of {{separation}} from the mother is characteristic of the <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> behind some complementary and alternative (CAM) psychotherapies. Such <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> are concerned {{not only with the}} effect of the young child's {{separation from the}} care of the mother, but with an emotional attachment between mother and child which advocates of these systems believe to develop prenatally. Such attachment is said to lead to emotional trauma if the child is separated from the birth mother and adopted, even if this occurs on the day of birth and even if the adoptive family provides all possible love and care. These beliefs were at one time in existence among some legitimate psychologists of psychoanalytic background. Today, however, beliefs in prenatal communication between mothers and infants are largely confined to unconventional thinkers such as William Emerson.|$|E

5|$|Crowning ceremonies {{arose from}} a worldview in which monarchs {{were seen as}} ordained by God to serve not merely as {{political}} or military leaders, nor as figureheads, but rather to occupy a vital spiritual place in their dominions as well. Coronations were created to reflect and enable these alleged connections; however, the <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> {{that gave birth to}} them have been radically altered in recent centuries by secularism, egalitarianism and the rise of constitutionalism and democracy. During the Protestant Reformation, the idea of divinely ordained monarchs began to be challenged.|$|E
5|$|East Timorese animist <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> did not {{fit with}} Indonesia's {{constitutional}} monotheism, resulting in mass conversions to Christianity.

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly attributed to the wider growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian <b>belief</b> <b>systems.</b> Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E

One bottle of wine is made by mixing rice wine with the carcasses of three dead animals. Minority groups in Cambodia also use loris-based medicine for treating broken bones, asthma, and sexually transmitted diseases. A survey by primatologist Anna Nekaris etal.

5|$|Although Carabane {{was once}} a {{regional}} capital, the village has since become so politically isolated {{from the rest of}} the country that it no longer fits into any category of the administrative structure decreed by the Senegalese government. The Jola account for the majority of the island's population and Jola society has no formal hierarchy. The indigenous population was originally animist, but although the sacred groves and fetishes survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students attend a primary school on the island, but must move at least as far as Elinkine to continue their studies.|$|E
40|$|Background: Diabetic {{self-management}} {{is important}} for controlling the diabetes complications and promoting health-related {{quality of life in}} these patients. The objective {{of this study was to}} examine a hypothetical model regarding influences of sociostructural determinants, collaborative decision-making and patient's <b>beliefs</b> <b>system</b> on diabetes self-management. Methods: In a cross-sectional descriptive study from Dec 2010 to Mar 2010, 500 patients of Iranian adult patients with type II diabetes attended the outpatient diabetic clinics of the Shariati Hospital in Tehran were selected by convenience sampling. Data were collected by The Demographical Information, Social- Economical Status and Diabetic History Questionnaire and eleven self-reported scales of this research. Structural equation modeling (SEM) with LIZREL software applied for data analysis. Results: The modified model had a desirable fitness to the observed data. Patient’s <b>beliefs</b> <b>system</b> directly influenced the diabetes self-management. Sociostructural determinants influenced diabetes self-management indirectly via collaborative decision-making and Patient’s <b>beliefs</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, collaborative decision-making significantly influenced patient’s <b>beliefs</b> <b>system</b> that thereby impacted diabetes self-management. Conclusions: Sociostructural determinants, collaborative decision-making and patient’s <b>beliefs</b> <b>system</b> are integrated and cooperatively affect on diabetes self-management.

5|$|In Iceland, the {{influence}} of pre-Christian <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> still pervaded the country's cultural heritage into the 20th century. There, farmer Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson founded the Heathen group Ásatrúarfélagið in 1972, which initially had 12 members. Beinteinsson served as Allsherjargodi (chief priest) {{until his death in}} 1993, when he was succeeded by Jormundur Ingi Hansen. As the group expanded in size, Hansen's leadership caused schisms, and to retain the unity of the movement, he stepped down and was replaced by Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson in 2003, by which time Ásatrúarfélagið had accumulated 777 members and played a visible role in Icelandic society. In England, the British Committee for the Restoration of the Odinic Rite was established by John Yeowell in 1972. In 1992, Mark Mirabello published Odin Brotherhood, which claimed the existence of a secret society of Odinists; most British Heathens doubt its existence.|$|E

5|$|The {{indigenous}} population was originally animist, {{but while the}} fetishes and sacred groves dedicated to initiation rites such as boukout survive as cultural icons of Casamance, the monotheistic <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> of Catholicism and Islam have become the most widely held in Carabane. The 1988 census reported that Muslims account for 94% {{of the population of}} Senegal, but only 26.5% of the population of Oussouye Department, where Carabane is located. Still, this department is largely rural, while Carabane has historically supported great ethnic diversity. Islam has not been practiced by Wolof and Serer fishermen since the 19th century, but the colonial administration brought with it many translators, guides, and secretaries from Dakar, many of whom were Muslim.|$|E

5|$|Heathenry's deities {{are adopted}} from the pre-Christian <b>belief</b> <b>systems</b> {{found in the}} various {{societies}} of Germanic Europe; they include divinities like Týr, Odin, Thor, Frigg and Freyja from Scandinavian sources, Wōden, Thunor and Ēostre from Anglo-Saxon sources, and figures such as Nehalennia from continental sources. Some practitioners adopt the belief, taken from Norse mythology, {{that there are two}} sets of deities, the Æsir and the Vanir. Certain practitioners blend the different regions and times together, for instance using a mix of Old English and Old Norse names for the deities, while others keep them separate and only venerate deities from a particular region. Some groups focus their veneration on a particular deity; for instance, the Brotherhood of Wolves, a Czech Heathen group, center their worship on the deity Fenrir. Similarly, many practitioners in the U.S. adopt a particular patron deity for themselves, and describe themselves as that entity's devotee using terms such as Thorsman or Odinsman.|$|E
5|$|Gods were {{combined}} {{with each other}} as easily as they were divided. A god could be called the ba of another, or two or more deities could be joined into one god with a combined name and iconography. Local gods were linked with greater ones, and deities with similar functions {{were combined}}. Ra was connected with the local deity Sobek to form Sobek-Ra; with his fellow ruling god, Amun, to form Amun-Ra; with the solar form of Horus to form Ra-Horakhty; and with several solar deities as Horemakhet-Khepri-Ra-Atum. On rare occasion, even deities of different sexes were joined in this way, producing combinations like Osiris-Neith and Mut-Min. This linking of deities is called syncretism. Unlike other situations for which this term is used, the Egyptian practice {{was not meant to}} fuse competing <b>belief</b> <b>systems,</b> although foreign deities could be syncretized with native ones. Instead, syncretism acknowledged the overlap between deities' roles and extended the sphere of influence for each of them. Syncretic combinations were not permanent; a god who was involved in one combination continued to appear separately and to form new combinations with other deities. But closely connected deities did sometimes merge. Horus absorbed several falcon gods from various regions, such as Khenty-irty and Khenty-khety, who became little more than local manifestations of him; Hathor subsumed a similar cow goddess, Bat; and an early funerary god, Khenti-Amentiu, was supplanted by Osiris and Anubis.|$|E
5|$|Natives {{incorporated}} the natural {{features of the}} ridgeline and surrounding geography into their spiritual <b>belief</b> <b>systems.</b> Many Native American stories were in turn incorporated into regional colonial folklore. The giant stone spirit Hobbomock (or Hobomock), a prominent figure in many stories, was credited with diverting {{the course of the}} Connecticut River where it suddenly swings east in Middletown, Connecticut, after several hundred miles of running due south. Hobbomuck is also credited with slaying a giant human-eating beaver who lived in a great lake that existed in the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. According to native beliefs as retold by European settlers, the corpse of the beaver remains visible as the Pocumtuck Ridge portion of the Metacomet Ridge. Later, after Hobbomuck diverted the course of the Connecticut River, he was punished to sleep forever as the prominent man-like form of the Sleeping Giant, part of the Metacomet Ridge in southern Connecticut. There seems to be an element of scientific truth in some of these tales. For instance, the great lake that the giant beaver was said to have inhabited may very well have been the post-glacial Lake Hitchcock, extant 10,000 years ago; the giant beaver may have been an actual prehistoric species of bear–sized beaver, Castoroides ohioensis, that lived at that time. Many features of the Metacomet Ridge region still bear names with Native American origins: Besek, Pistapaug, Coginchaug, Mattabesett, Metacomet, Totoket, Norwottuck, Hockanum, Nonotuck, Pocumtuck, and others.|$|E
