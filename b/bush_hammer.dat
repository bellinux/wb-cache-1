50|$|Remove {{existing}} concrete {{from the}} slots {{followed by the}} cleaning out of all debris. Use maximum weight 30 pound jackhammers to remove the concrete remaining between the saw cuts. If the concrete removal operations cause damage to the pavement that is to remain, discontinue concrete removal operations and only resume after taking corrective measures. During concrete removal operations, use a small <b>bush</b> <b>hammer</b> as necessary to produce a flat, level surface within the slot so the backfill flows and consolidates under the dowel bars.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to those hand tools listed above, the marble sculptor would {{use a variety of}} hammers - both for the striking of edge tools (chisels and hand drills) and for striking the stone directly (Bocciarda a Martello in Italian, Boucharde in French, <b>Bush</b> <b>Hammer</b> in English). Following the work of the hammer and chisel, the sculptor will sometimes refine the form further through the use of Rasps, Files and Abrasive Rubbing Stones and/or Sandpaper to smooth the surface contours of the form.To achieve a high-lustre polish on marble a very fine abrasive, tin oxide, is used following the use of pumice or finer grits of sandpaper.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>hammers</b> {{can help}} to {{increase}} bonding effectiveness when applying new concrete to an existing concrete surface by increasing the surface area of the bonding zone.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} is principally constructed of reinforced <b>bush</b> <b>hammered</b> concrete, {{which was also}} originally the interior wall surface. More recently, the interior walls have been covered with painted wood, to allow for increased flexibility in the display of artworks.|$|R
50|$|For the roof, {{the shape}} of a double {{hyperbolic}} parabolic, the architect employs prestressed concrete, Cables are linked to exterior pillars of <b>bush</b> <b>hammered</b> concrete. The exterior uses white concrete, either <b>bush</b> <b>hammered,</b> in the form of boards, or alternatively vertical and horizontal. Like the exterior, the interior details, chimney, stairs, drawings on doors, the coating of the floor and walls were selected by mutual agreement between the owners and Breuer. The smallest details were the object of multiple plans being sent nearly everyday from the office in New York. In 1992 it was registered at the supplementary inventory of historical monuments and has been classed as a historical monument since 2005.|$|R
5000|$|One {{frequently}} associates {{the name}} [...] "Eturamina" [...] (for Thorame) with the Roman {{period for the}} territory then indistinct of both Thorame. The village occupied a particular order in the Gallo-Roman administrative hierarchy, having the statute of [...] "Civitas" [...] following the example Glandeves (Entrevaux), Senensis (Senez) or Dinia (Digne-les-Bains). Eturamina {{is one of the}} first Evéchés of High Provence at the 4th century, before being transferred to Senez. An engraved tegula (Roman tile), found during drainage works in the 19th century, is preserved at the Museum of the National antiquities of German St in <b>Bush</b> <b>hammer.</b> One finds the name of the bishop Sévérianus, who left his name in several councils which attests to his presence and religious role of Eturamina. It is extremely probable that the choice of the establishment in this valley corresponds to a will of Christianization of the people living back in the alpine valleys, which would explain also its transfer soon after at the beginning of the 5th century with Senez.|$|E
50|$|Great {{care was}} taken by E. Schmidt, the {{technical}} designer, in drawing up the detailed specifications for a building {{which was to be}} constructed using Asger Skovgaard Ostenfeld's recently developed deformation technique for reinforced concrete structures. The finish on the four-inch-thick walls with metal-framed windows was achieved by manual <b>bush</b> <b>hammering.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Bush</b> <b>hammers</b> {{exist in}} many forms, from simple {{hand-held}} hammers to large electric machines, {{but the basic}} functional property of the tool {{is always the same}} - a grid of conical or pyramidal points {{at the end of a}} large metal slug. The repeated impact of these points into stone or concrete creates a rough, pockmarked [...] that resembles naturally weathered rock.|$|R
50|$|Haggerston School is {{the only}} English {{secondary}} school to be designed by internationally regarded architect, Ernő Goldfinger, who studied under Auguste Perret in Paris. Goldfinger's work is unique in Britain in that it combines the influences of Perret, {{one of the first}} architects to develop the use of concrete aesthetically, with detailing and forms derived from Le Corbusier. Goldfinger knew both architects personally. The elevations of the school follow the mathematical proportions of the Golden Section and it includes a double-height circulation spine with balcony. The school is distinctive for the large amount of timber used in the construction and contains some of Goldfinger's boldest and most handsome public interiors including <b>bush</b> <b>hammered</b> concrete and coffered ceilings in the entrance and hall block.|$|R
50|$|Cowen {{commissioned}} architect Ernest Schaufelberg {{to design}} the theatre in an Italianate style. Constructed from 1922 to 1924, {{it was the first}} theatre to be built in London {{after the end of the}} First World War. One of the first buildings in London to experiment with concrete, its façade is principally made of <b>bush</b> <b>hammered</b> concrete, with brick piers supporting the roof. Since the demolition of the original Wembley Stadium, the theatre is now the oldest remaining public building designed wholly using concrete as a textured and exposed façade. The theatre's famous figurine, Terpsichore (perched high above the entrance) was sculpted by M. H. Crichton of the Bromsgrove Guild, a noted company of artisans from Worcestershire. The theatre is entered through bronze double doors, and internally there is a foyer of grey and red marble, with a beaten copper ticket booth.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{types of}} {{concrete}} were used: normal aggregate for hidden structural work, {{and a special}} red granite aggregate for exposed surfaces which were subsequently <b>bush</b> <b>hammered.</b> Portal roof frames at approximately 12-foot intervals support precast purlins and -inch precast roof slabs, screeded with vermiculite and covered with copper sheeting on 2-inch felt insulation. [...] The cathedral was designed with accessibility to all in mind, with a shallow gradient ramp incorporated at the End Street entrance. A flight of steps leads up from Saratoga Avenue, where a projecting concrete slab provides a canopy overhead.Stained glass windows transform the sunshine outside into patterns of blue, red, orange, yellow and green within the nave of the Cathedral. The theme of each bay or picture windows was suggested by Bishop Boyle. All the stained glass work {{was carried out by}} Patrick Pollen of Dublin.|$|R
40|$|Marble slabs with {{rough surface}} have {{captured}} {{a large share}} in the market of ornamental stones in recent years. There are many different methods of stone surface treatment currently used to improve the aesthetic appearance of {{the surface of the}} marble slab or tile or to increase the roughness. Traditional methods like <b>bush</b> <b>hammering,</b> polishing or flaming have various disadvantages that may reduce the market interest for particular applications. The aim {{of this study is to}} compare the water jet surface treatment method with traditional methods. For this purpose five different types of stones (granite, basalt, serpentine, limestone and marble) were treated with water jet and the results were compared with the results obtained from traditional methods. The results of the color, gloss, luminance and roughness analysis were used as the comparison parameters. Results so far achieved indicate that the application of water jets in surface treatment can reduce (or even eliminate) some disadvantages of traditional methods because it enables to obtain a surface with required roughness while preserving aesthetic appearance of the stone...|$|R
6000|$|He {{commenced}} it {{by picking}} {{the remnants of}} the pork out of the frying-pan, and when he had replaced them carefully in the bag, he filled the former with water {{and set it on the}} fire. That done, he proceeded to hew four square pegs, and spent some little time cutting, [...] "One Discovery," [...] upon the largest of them. Then with a compass in his palm he strode with even paces up the slope of the hill, and drove one of the pegs in, turned sharply, and floundered into the <b>bush,</b> where he <b>hammered</b> down a second, and came back along the river until he had paced off and marked down an oblong.|$|R
2500|$|After the convention, Clinton and Gore began a {{bus tour}} around the United States, while the Bush/Quayle {{campaign}} began to criticize Clinton's character, highlighting accusations of infidelity and draft dodging. The Bush campaign emphasized {{its foreign policy}} successes such as Desert Storm, {{and the end of}} the Cold War. Bush also contrasted his military service to Clinton's lack thereof, and criticized Clinton's lack of foreign policy expertise. However, as the economy was the main issue, Bush's campaign floundered across the nation, even in strongly Republican areas, and Clinton maintained leads with over 50 percent of the vote nationwide consistently, while Bush typically saw numbers in the upper 30s. As Bush's economic edge had evaporated, his campaign looked to energize its socially conservative base at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston, Texas. At the Convention, Bush's primary campaign opponent Pat Buchanan gave his famous [...] "culture war" [...] speech, criticizing Clinton's and Gore's social progressiveness, and voicing skepticism on his [...] "New Democrat" [...] brand. After President Bush accepted his renomination, his campaign saw a small bounce in the polls, but this was short lived, as Clinton maintained his lead. The campaign continued with a lopsided lead for Clinton through September, until Ross Perot decided to re-enter the race. Ross Perot's re-entry in the race was welcome by the Bush campaign, as Fred Steeper, a poll taker for Bush, said, [...] "He'll be important if we accomplish our goal, which is to draw even with Clinton." [...] Initially, Perot's return saw the Texas billionaire's numbers stay low, until he was given the opportunity to participate in a trio of unprecedented three-man debates. The race narrowed, as Perot's numbers significantly improved as Clinton's numbers declined, while Bush's numbers remained more or less the same from earlier in the race as Perot and <b>Bush</b> began to <b>hammer</b> at Clinton on character issues once again.|$|R
