5|$|As {{tensions}} rose {{between the}} colonists and Britain {{in the early}} 1770s, Philipse remained loyal to the crown. He was arrested in August 1776 and held in Connecticut until a parole grant {{at the end of}} the year allowed him to return home as long as he did nothing to support the British war effort. He <b>broke</b> <b>that</b> promise the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to attack a British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E

5|$|Scandal {{continued}} to plague Clements as highway commissioner. In March 1960, news <b>broke</b> <b>that</b> the highway department {{was about to}} lease 34 used dump trucks at a very favorable price from Louisville Ford dealer Thurston Cooke, who had served as finance chairman for Combs' gubernatorial campaign. Some charged that this amounted to a political payoff by Clements. Combs, already under fire for appointing Clements, canceled the lease bid on April 19. Clements was offended by this action and considered it a public rebuke. The incident caused a rift between Combs and Clements that never fully healed, although Clements did not resign immediately.|$|E

Some were residents anxious to see the area or visit relatives they had {{not seen since the}} slide; others were truck drivers frustrated by long detours.

5|$|Hurricane Danny was {{the only}} {{hurricane}} to make landfall in the United States during the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season, and the second hurricane and fourth tropical storm of the season. The system became the earliest-formed fifth tropical or subtropical storm of the Atlantic season in history when it attained tropical storm strength on July 17, and held that record until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season when Tropical Storm Emily <b>broke</b> <b>that</b> record by several days. Like the previous four tropical or subtropical cyclones of the season, Danny had a non-tropical origin, after a trough spawned convection that entered the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Danny was guided northeast through the Gulf of Mexico by two high pressure areas, a rare occurrence {{in the middle of}} July. After making landfall on the Gulf Coast, Danny tracked across the southeastern United States and ultimately affected parts of New England with rain and wind.|$|E
5|$|The 1936 Summer Olympics, officially {{known as}} the Games of the XI Olympiad, was an {{international}} multi-sport event held in Berlin, Germany, from 1 August to 16 August.

This was the highest number of nations represented at any Games to date. Athletes from 32 NOCs won medals, of which 21 secured at least one gold medal. As a result, 17 NOCs were left without any medal. The host NOC, Germany, received a total of 89 medals, a record for a united German team, although East Germany <b>broke</b> <b>that</b> record in 1976, 1980 and 1988.|$|E
5|$|When it was active, Hurricane Ava set many records. Several {{have since}} been broken, but Ava still holds a few. Ava ceased being a Category5 {{hurricane}} on June 7, 1973. 1994's Emilia reached Category5 intensity on July 19, 1994. This span of 7,712days, which Ava began and Emilia ended, is the longest time between successive Category5 hurricanes in the northeastern Pacific, and anywhere worldwide, in recorded history. When Hurricane Gilma reached Category5 strength on July 24 also in 1994, it marked the shortest gap between Category5 Pacific hurricanes recorded. Ava was also a Category5 hurricane for exactly 24hours; a record at the time. Hurricane John <b>broke</b> <b>that</b> in the 1994 season, and hurricanes Linda and Ioke also lasted longer, tied with John. In addition, Ava is the strongest June tropical cyclone {{in the western hemisphere}} north of the equator.|$|E
