40|$|This is {{the final}} report of Defra project OF 0154. Under the European Union Regulation on the organic {{production}} of agricultural products (2092 / 91), crops raised in organic systems should be grown from organically produced seed or vegetative material. However, the supply of organic seed is limited in the UK and in Europe as a whole, and so <b>by</b> <b>way</b> <b>of</b> <b>derogation,</b> the EU Regulation permits the use of untreated, conventional seed on organic farms only when an appropriate organic variety cannot be sourced. At {{the start of this}} project, the derogation period was due to end on 31 December 2000; however, it was extended in June 1999 to 31 December 2003, after which the use of conventional seed will not be permitted on organic farms. To evaluate the current situation regarding organic seed availability, future demand for seed, and the problems restricting the development of an active organic seed production industry in the UK, the following tasks were undertaken with the aim of helping to facilitate the commercial use of organic seed and contributing to the ending of the use of conventional seed on organic farming systems. Objectives 1. 	Assess the current and potential availability of organic seed, in the UK, elsewhere in Europe and further afield. 2. 	Develop a forecast of demand for organic seed in the UK over the next 5 - 10 years. 3. 	Determine the obstacles that need to be overcome {{and whether or not they}} can be dealt with through UK or European co-operation. 4. 	Highlight problems that need further research input. 5. 	Produce a report covering the availability of organically produced seed for commercial organic use, including details of species and varieties where further work is needed and recommendations for future actions. Results •	There are 251 different varieties of organic seed commercially available to UK organic farmers and growers, 98...|$|E
