2500|$|Enterobacteria phage λ (lambda phage, {{coliphage}} λ) is a <b>bacterial</b> <b>virus,</b> or bacteriophage, that infects the bacterial species Escherichia coli (E. coli). [...] It {{was discovered}} by Esther Lederberg in 1950 when she noticed that streaks of mixtures of two E. coli strains, one of which treated with ultraviolet light, was [...] "nibbled and plaqued". The wild type of this virus has a temperate lifecycle that allows it to either reside within the genome of its host through lysogeny or enter into a lytic phase (during which it kills and lyses the cell to produce offspring); mutant strains are unable to lysogenize cells- instead they grow and enter the lytic cycle after superinfecting an already lysogenized cell.|$|E

40|$|International audienceTailed {{double-stranded}} DNA viruses (order Caudovirales) {{represent the}} dominant morphotype among viruses infecting bacteria. Analysis and comparison of complete genome sequences of tailed <b>bacterial</b> <b>viruses</b> provided insights into their origin and evolution. Structural and genomic studies have unexpectedly revealed that tailed <b>bacterial</b> <b>viruses</b> are evolutionarily related to eukaryotic herpesviruses. Organisms {{from the third}} domain of life, Archaea, are also infected by viruses that, in their overall morphology, resemble tailed viruses of bacteria. However, high-resolution structural information is currently unavailable {{for any of these}} viruses, and only a few complete genomes have been sequenced so far. Here we identified nine proviruses that are clearly related to tailed <b>bacterial</b> <b>viruses</b> and integrated into chromosomes of species belonging to four different taxonomic orders of the Archaea. This more than doubled the number of genome sequences available for comparative studies. Our analyses indicate that highly mosaic tailed archaeal virus genomes evolve by homologous and illegitimate recombination with genomes of other viruses, by diversification, and by acquisition of cellular genes. Comparative genomics of these viruses and related proviruses revealed a set of conserved genes encoding putative proteins similar to virion assembly and maturation, as well as genome packaging proteins of tailed <b>bacterial</b> <b>viruses</b> and herpesviruses. Furthermore, fold prediction and structural modeling experiments suggest that the major capsid proteins of tailed archaeal viruses adopt the same topology as the corresponding proteins of tailed <b>bacterial</b> <b>viruses</b> and eukaryotic herpesviruses. Data presented in this study strongly support the hypothesis that tailed viruses infecting archaea share a common ancestry with tailed <b>bacterial</b> <b>viruses</b> and herpesviruses...|$|R

50|$|Zygotic {{induction}} {{occurs when}} a bacterial cell carrying the silenced DNA of a <b>bacterial</b> <b>virus</b> in its chromosome transfers the viral DNA along with its own DNA to another bacterial cell lacking the virus, causing {{the recipient of the}} DNA to break open. In the donor cell, a repressor protein encoded by the prophage (viral DNA) keeps the viral genes turned off so that virus is not produced. When DNA is transferred to the recipient cell by conjugation,the viral genes in the transferred DNA are immediately turned on because the recipient cell lacks the repressor. As a result, lots of virus is made in the recipient cell, and lysis eventually occurs to release the new virus.|$|E
