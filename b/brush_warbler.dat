50|$|The Aldabra <b>brush</b> <b>warbler</b> was a shy and {{retiring}} bird, {{difficult to}} observe {{in the dense}} undergrowth in which it lived. It was most readily located by its chirruping call.|$|E
50|$|The Moheli <b>brush</b> <b>warbler</b> (Nesillas mariae) is {{a species}} of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae.It is found only in Comoros.Its natural habitat is {{subtropical}} or tropical moist montane forests.|$|E
50|$|The Aldabra <b>brush</b> <b>warbler</b> (Nesillas aldabrana) is an extinct {{bird in the}} acrocephalid warbler family. It was {{endemic to}} the atoll of Aldabra in the Seychelles and an {{individual}} was last seen in 1983.|$|E
50|$|After the {{discovery}} the <b>brush</b> <b>warbler</b> was not seen until {{a survey by}} Robert Prys-Jones of the British Museum of Natural History from 1974 to 1976. At the end of 1975 he found six further birds which were all males. The birds were ringed and photographed. In 1983, only one male was observed and the Aldabra <b>brush</b> <b>warbler</b> was considered as the rarest and (in its occurrence) most restricted bird in the world. It was confined to a 10 ha large coastal strip on the Aldabran island of Malabar. Following intensive surveys, the extinction of this bird was confirmed in 1986. It has been listed as officially extinct by the IUCN since 1994.|$|E
50|$|The Aldabra <b>brush</b> <b>warbler</b> was {{discovered}} by British ornithologists Constantine Walter Benson, Malcolm Penny and Tony Diamond in 1967 and described in 1968 by Constantine Walter Benson and Malcolm Penny on basis of a male, a female and a nest with 3 eggs. Juveniles were never found.|$|E
50|$|The Malagasy <b>brush</b> <b>warbler</b> (Nesillas typica), {{also known}} as the Madagascar brush-warbler, is a species of Old World warbler in the family Acrocephalidae. It is found in Comoros and Madagascar. Its natural {{habitats}} are subtropical or tropical dry forests, subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests, and subtropical or tropical moist shrubland.|$|E
50|$|The Aldabra <b>brush</b> <b>warbler</b> was {{a slender}} bird with {{relatively}} short wings and a long, pointed tail. It reached a total length of 18 to 20 cm. The upper parts were dun and the underparts a rather paler hue. The song was never recorded but {{the call was}} a nasal, three-syllable chirrup.|$|E
50|$|The Seychelles warbler (Acrocephalus sechellensis), {{also known}} as Seychelles <b>brush</b> <b>warbler,</b> is a small {{songbird}} found on five granitic and corraline islands in the Seychelles. It is a greenish-brown bird with long legs and a long slender bill. It is primarily found in forested areas on the islands. The Seychelles warbler is a rarity in that it exhibits cooperative breeding, or alloparenting; {{which means that the}} monogamous pair is assisted by nonbreeding female helpers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{uniqueness}} of the Seychelles' ecology {{is reflected in the}} US$1.8 million project of the Global Environment Trust Fund of the World Bank (see Glossary) entitled Biodiversity Conservation and Marine Pollution Abatement, that began in 1993. The World Bank study for this project states that the islands contain, {{out of a total of}} 1,170 flowering plants, [...] "at least 75 species of flowering plants, 15 of birds, 3 of mammals, 30 of reptiles and amphibians, and several hundred species of snails, insects, spiders and other invertebrates" [...] found nowhere else. The diversity of species in the islands is being assessed by the Nature Protection Trust of Seychelles. In addition, the waters contain more than 1000 kinds of fish, of which more than one-third are associated with coral reefs. Specific examples of unique birds are the black paradise flycatcher, the black parrot, the <b>brush</b> <b>warbler,</b> and a flightless rail. Most famous of all the Seychelles animals are the giant tortoises of the genus Aldabrachelys.|$|E
