50|$|The valley though {{which our}} rout {{of this day}} lay and through which the river winds it's {{meandering}} course is a <b>beatifull</b> level plain with but little timber and that {{on the verge of}} the river. the land is tolerably fertile, consisting of a black or dark yellow loam, and covered with grass from 9 Inches to 2 feet high. The plain ascends gradually {{on either side of the}} river to the bases of two ranges of mountains which ly parallel to the river and which terminate 〈it's〉 the width of the vally. the tops of these mountains were yet partially covered with snow while we in the valley. were suffocated nearly with the intense heat of the midday sun. the nights are so could that two blankets are not more than sufficient covering.|$|E
