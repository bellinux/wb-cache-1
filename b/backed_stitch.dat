5000|$|<b>Back</b> <b>stitches</b> {{pass through}} the fabric ground in an {{encircling}} motion. The needle in the simplest backstitch comes up {{from the back of}} the fabric, makes a stitch to the right going back to the back of the fabric, then passes behind the first stitch and comes up to the front of the fabric to the left of the first stitch. The needle then goes back to the back of the fabric through the same hole the stitch first came up from. The needle then repeats the movement to the left of the stitches and continues.

50|$|The {{process is}} lengthy and time-consuming. The {{first step is}} to trace the design on the fabric. This is done by placing a tracing paper with the design on it on the fabric and {{spreading}} a paste of chalk powder over it. This traces the design on the fabric. Depending on the design, the Gota is cut and folded into various shapes. It is then appliquéd by hemming or <b>back</b> <b>stitching</b> it on the fabric.|$|R
50|$|The process used to tailor, patch, mend and {{reinforce}} cloth fostered {{the development of}} sewing techniques, and the decorative possibilities of sewing led {{to the art of}} embroidery.Indeed, the remarkable stability of basic embroidery stitches has been noted:The art of embroidery has been found world-wide and several early examples have been found. Works in China have been dated to the Warring States period (5th-3rd century BC). In a garment from Migration period Sweden, roughly 300-700 AD, the edges of bands of trimming are reinforced with running <b>stitch,</b> <b>back</b> <b>stitch,</b> stem stitch, tailor's buttonhole stitch, and whip-stitching, but it is uncertain whether this work simply reinforced the seams or should be interpreted as decorative embroidery.|$|R
50|$|Backstitch or <b>back</b> <b>stitch</b> and its {{variants}} stem stitch, outline stitch {{and split}} stitch are {{a class of}} embroidery and sewing stitches in which individual stitches are made backward to {{the general direction of}} sewing. In embroidery, these stitches form lines and are most often used to outline shapes and to add fine detail to an embroidered picture. It is used as a hand-sewing utility stitch to attach definitively and strongly two pieces of fabric together. It is also used for writing.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of {{computer}} technology, patches were made by hand. The general process, however, remains the same today. First, a fabric backing is cut to shape. To prevent fraying, {{the edges of the}} backing are heat-sealed. Then, the thread is stitched into place. Some designs incorporate the backing as the background of the patch, while others completely cover the <b>backing</b> with <b>stitches.</b> To finish the patch, iron-on adhesive may be applied to the reverse—a step that was not originally done.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to clarify the relation between the grades of hand-sewing skills of university students and their experiences of clothing construction in previous schools. This study was composed of a questionnaire on the experiences of clothing construction, the scores of a practical examination on hand-sewing skills, and the scores of sewing skills learned under technical guidance. Research was conducted on 72 students, 33 men and 39 women, who were studying to obtain an elementary school teacherʼs license. The survey was conducted in October and November 2009. The following results were obtained : 1) Although most of the students had had experience of learning clothing construction in elementary school and junior high school, many of them had little experience of this at high school. Those who had sewing experience at home tended to be women rather than men. There {{was no significant difference in}} the contents of clothing construction between elementary school, junior high school, and high school. Therefore, pouches and aprons had been made regardless of the grade of school. 2) Comparing women and men on hand-sewing skills, women had significantly higher scores for the plain stitch, the half-back stitch, and the hem stitch, and no significant difference was found for the <b>back</b> <b>stitch.</b> 3) Furthermore, when hand-sewing skills were analyzed, it turned out that these were correlated to skill in the plain stitch and half-back stitch...|$|R

25|$|There {{are also}} {{different}} ways to insert the needle into the stitch. Knitting through {{the front of a}} stitch is called Western knitting. Going through the <b>back</b> of a <b>stitch</b> is called Eastern knitting.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to clarify the level of university students' hand sewing skills and knowledge, and to examine the retention of the learning up to the high school. Moreover, teaching contents necessary for elementary school students to acquire hand sewing skills are also considered. This research was composed of a questionnaire on hand sewing knowledge, a questionnaire on the memory of courses and confidence in skills, a practical examination to evaluate hand sewing skills and a survey of the actual state of basic skills such as how to handle a needle and cloth. The research was conducted on 417 university students. 209 men and 208 women, the survey being conducted in June and December 2015. and in June and November 2016. The following results were obtained: 1) There were many items regarding which the students only half understood regarding hand sewing knowledge. The problem in the questionnaires was a low response rate and a low percentage of correct answers. 2) The evaluations for hand sewing skills were significantly higher for women than for men with ball knots, ball beads, plain stitch, half backstitch, and <b>back</b> <b>stitches.</b> Around 10 percent of all students could not sew a half backstitch, a backstitch or a hem stitch. 3) About half the students could not sew a straight stitch. Moreover, about half the students could not hold cloth suitably to perform a plain stitch. It was found that students who could hold cloth correctly were able to perform a straight stitch. 4) Furthermore, basic skills such as how to handle a needle and cloth were found {{to be related to the}} skill evaluations...|$|R
50|$|Just {{as there}} are several ways to produce a woven tapestry, so there are {{different}} ways to do tapestry crochet. Most tapestry crochet is done with single crochet stitches, but the slip stitch, half double, and double crochet stitches are also used. Yarns not in play are either carried inside the stitches, dropped and picked up when needed (also called intarsia), or they run along the <b>back</b> of the <b>stitches.</b>|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} shown that {{integration}} of linkage maps can aid de novo assemblies with long range, chromosome scale recombination data, without which, assemblies can be subject to macro ordering errors. Optical mapping is the process of immobilizing the DNA on a slide and digesting it with restriction enzymes. The fragment ends are then fluorescently tagged and <b>stitched</b> <b>back</b> together.For the last two decades, optical mapping has been prohibitively expensive, but recent advances in technology have reduced cost significantly.|$|R
50|$|The {{motion of}} the right wrist is used to slip the right needle into the loop of the stitch being knitted and 'scoop' or 'hook' the yarn onto the right needle while the left {{forefinger}} holds the yarn across the <b>back</b> of the <b>stitch.</b> An alternative method of collecting the yarn involves using the thumb or index finger of the right hand to hold the yarn in place as the new stitch is being {{pulled out of the}} loop.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most popular}} hair and eyebrow {{restoration}} surgery technique is follicular unit transplantation, which involves {{the removal of}} donor follicles {{from the back of}} the patient's head (where hair tends to be more permanent).
