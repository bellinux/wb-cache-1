5|$|In 1991 Berlin's public {{prosecution}} department rendered {{this incident}} assistance in emergency and self-defence in {{consequence of the}} police officer stating that he felt his life being threatened. In many cases West Berliner rescuers {{were not able to}} reach wounded persons because they were either on GDR territory or in East Berlin. They had no authorization to set foot into this territory, so that a trespassing would have been life-endangering for the rescue workers. The four children Çetin Mert, Cengaver Katrancı, Siegfried Kroboth and Giuseppe Savoca, who fell into the Spree at the Gröben riverside between the years 1972 and 1975, could not be rescued even though West Berlin rescue forces arrived quickly on site. In April 1983 the transit passenger Rudolf Burkert {{died of a heart attack}} during an interrogation at the <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> Derwitz. During a subsequent autopsy in West Germany several external injuries were detected, so that an external forceful impact could not be ruled out as the cause of death. This lethal incident resulted not only in negative press reports but also led to an intervention by Helmut Kohl and Franz Josef Strauss. For the imminent public-sector loans they imposed on the GDR the condition to conduct humane border controls. Two further deaths of West Germans in transit traffic, shortly after Burkert's death, set off demonstrations against the GDR regime and a broad media discussion. In the period that followed inspections decreased in transit traffic.|$|E
25|$|In June 2015, Belarus {{established}} a visa-free regime for foreign hikers and cyclists, {{going to the}} Belovezhskaya Pushcha National Park through the <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> Białowieża–Pererov {{for a period of}} up to three days. A pass for a visa-free visit can be obtained electronically and is only valid for the territory of the national park.|$|E
25|$|There are {{suggestions}} {{about a new}} larger <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> to be built on the Norwegian side, as the current station has insufficient capacity to handle increased traffic, and the ground is not sufficiently stable to allow an expansion at the current site. Individual Norwegian police executives {{have called for a}} common <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> located directly on the border line. This would allow for a more cost-effective and less time-consuming operation. However, Norwegian and Russian legislation, as well as the Schengen Agreement, prohibit such an operation. The Parliament of Norway's Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has taken initiative to introduce a 24-hour-a-day opening time at the crossing; this has been rejected by the local police district, who stated that nearly all trans-border traffic is persons and that there is hardly any demand for a night service. Estimates show that border traffic may increase to 400,000 crossings by the mid- to late 2010s. The demand for a larger station remains as of 2017.|$|E
5000|$|In some {{countries}} (e.g. China and Japan), there are <b>border</b> <b>checkpoints</b> when both entering and exiting the country, while in others (e.g. U.S. and Canada), there are <b>border</b> <b>checkpoints</b> only when entering the country.

In addition to these border installations there are 6 preserved border stations ready to be operational once Estonia has left or no longer maintains the Schengen Agreement between the European Union and Estonia. These facilities are located only in the south on the Estonian-Latvian border.|$|R

25|$|It is {{possible}} to travel into Shatoujiao on the China side, via Sha Tau Kok border. Coaches run at a regular schedule from Luen Wo Hui Bus Terminus, situated near the recently opened Luen Wo Market and Library complex, and from Fanling MTR Station. Tickets cost HK$20 for each passenger as of 2005. Travellers are taken through the Shek Chung Au (石涌凹) <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> without permit search, then heading directly to the Sha Tau Kok Control Point.|$|E
25|$|The Zrinski Bridge/Zrínyi Bridge {{connects the}} Croatian A4 and the Hungarian M7 motorways, {{spanning}} the river Mura. As it also spans Hungarian–Croatian border, a <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> is situated {{adjacent to the}} bridge, on the north bank. The bridge is located between Goričan interchange of the A4 motorway and the M70 motorway interchange of the M7. The bridge {{is a part of}} a major north–south transportation corridor in Croatia and Hungary and a part of European routes E65 and E71 as well as the Pan-European corridor Vb.|$|E
25|$|Today, Sha Tau Kok has a {{bus station}} {{served by the}} KMB Route 78K service {{as well as the}} smaller sixteen-seater minibus or public light bus service route number 55k. Both begin in Sheung Shui and pass through Luen Wo Hui before {{terminating}} at Sha Tau Kok. However, passengers may not proceed through the Closed Area <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> if they do not carry a valid permit. Police personnel will board the bus at the checkpoint to check the ID Card or identification documents and the required Frontier Closed Area permit of each passenger. If passengers do not possess these documents, they will be asked to leave the bus by police personnel.|$|E

25|$|The {{project was}} a co-production between Miramax Films and Paramount's classics-based {{division}} in a 50/50 partnership, and production {{was scheduled for}} May 2006 in New Mexico and Texas. With a total budget of $25 million (at least half spent in New Mexico), production was slated for the New Mexico cities of Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Las Vegas (which doubled as the border towns of Eagle Pass and Del Rio, Texas), with other scenes shot around Marfa and Sanderson in West Texas. The U.S.-Mexico border crossing bridge was actually a freeway overpass in Las Vegas, with a <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> set built {{at the intersection of}} Interstate 25 and New Mexico State Highway 65. The Mexican town square was filmed in Piedras Negras, Coahuila.|$|E
500|$|The filmmakers {{went to the}} Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Customs {{early on}} with the script {{and told them that}} they were trying to present as {{detailed}} and accurate a picture of the current drug war as possible. The DEA and Customs pointed out inaccuracies in the script. In addition, they gave the production team access to the <b>border</b> <b>checkpoint</b> to Mexico, as shown in the film during the scene in which Wakefield and his people talk with border officials. Despite the assistance, the DEA did not try to influence the content of the script. Soderbergh said Traffic had influences from the films of Richard Lester and Jean-Luc Godard. He also spent time analyzing The Battle of Algiers and Z, which, according to the director, had the feeling that the footage was [...] "caught" [...] and not staged. Another inspiration was Alan J. Pakula's film All the President's Men because of its ability to tackle serious issues while being entertaining. In the opening credits of his film, Soderbergh tried to replicate the typeface from All the President's Men and the placement on-screen at the bottom left-hand corner. Analyzing this film helped the director deal with the large cast and working in many different locations for Traffic.|$|E
