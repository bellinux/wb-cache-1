25|$|During the Jemdet Nasr (3600–3100 BCE) and Early Dynastic periods (3100–2350 BCE), {{southern}} Mesopotamia {{experienced a}} {{growth in the}} number and size of settlements, suggesting strong population growth.

25|$|This {{species is}} widely {{considered}} {{to be one of}} the world’s most invasive insects, partly due to their tendency to overwinter indoors and the unpleasant odor and stain left by their bodily fluid when frightened or squashed, as well as their tendency to bite humans. In Europe it is currently increasing to the detriment of indigenous species, its voracious appetite enabling it to outcompete and even eat other ladybirds. The harlequin ladybird is also highly resistant to diseases that affect other ladybird species, and carries a microsporidian parasite to which it is immune, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> infect and kill other species.

500|$|For {{purposes}} of an accurate estimation of emissions, the analysis {{took into consideration}} the differences in operation between plug-in hybrids. Some, like the Chevrolet Volt, can operate in all-electric mode without using gasoline, and others operate in a blended mode like the Toyota Prius PHV, which uses both energy stored in the battery and energy from the gasoline tank to propel the vehicle, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> deliver substantial all-electric driving in blended mode. In addition, since the all-electric range of plug-in hybrids depends {{on the size of}} the battery pack, the analysis introduced a utility factor as a projection of the share of miles that will be driven using electricity by an average driver, for both, electric only and blended EV modes. Since all-electric cars do not produce tailpipe emissions, the utility factor applies only to plug-in hybrids. The following table shows the overall fuel economy expressed in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) and the utility factor for the ten MY2014 plug-in hybrids available in the U.S. market, and EPA's best estimate of the [...] tailpipe emissions produced by these PHEVs.|$|E

They used old photos of the band members, pairing them up with pulsating, moving, otherworldly backgrounds, for example they filmed floating fluorescent paint in a fish tank with a GoPro camera. The scene where Toshi appears to be standing on top of a waterfall, was filmed in the couple's own kitchen sink with running tap water, while the camera emerging from the water to show the waterfall was actually filmed in Greece. Adobe After Effects and Smoke was used during the production.|$|E

2500|$|Thich Nhat Hanh states, [...] "Pratitya samutpada is {{sometimes}} called the teaching {{of cause and effect}}, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be misleading, because we usually think of cause and effect as separate entities, with cause always preceding effect, and one cause leading to one effect.

In the sutras, this image is given: [...] "Three cut reeds can stand only by leaning on one another. If you take one away, the other two will fall." [...] In Buddhist texts, one cause is never enough to bring about an effect. A cause must, at the same time, be an effect, and every effect must also be the cause of something else. This is the basis, states Hanh, for {{the idea that there is}} no first and only cause, something that does not itself need a cause.|$|E

[...] However, like many other misconceptions, there is only partial truth to these beliefs. [...] Some, though not all stallions can be vicious or hard to handle, occasionally due to genetics, but usually due to improper training. Others are very well-trained and have excellent manners.

The following table shows the overall EV/hybrid fuel economy expressed in terms of miles per gallon gasoline equivalent (mpg-e) and the utility factor for the ten MY2014 plug-in hybrids available in the U.S. market.

2500|$|Scott's novel Old Mortality, {{published}} in 1816, was largely set {{in and around}} Tillietudlem Castle. Chapter XI describes the location: [...] "All heads were now bent from the battlements of the turret, which commanded a distant prospect down the vale of the river. The Tower of Tillietudlem stood, or perhaps yet stands, upon the angle of a very precipitous bank, formed by the junction of a considerable brook with the Clyde." [...] In June 1829 {{he wrote to his}} friend James Skene, who was preparing etchings to illustrate Scott's books, [...] "I did not think on Craignethan in writing about Tillietudlem, and I believe it differs in several respects from my Chateau en Espagne. It is not on the Clyde in particular, and, if I recollect, the view is limited and wooded. <b>But</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be no objection to adopting it as that which public taste has adopted as coming nearest to the ideal of the place." [...] In the revised Magnum Edition of Old Mortality, {{published in}} 1830, Scott added a footnote: [...] "The Castle of Tillietudlem is imaginary; but the ruins of Craignethan Castle, situated on the Nethan, about three miles from its junction with the Clyde, have something of the character of the description in the text". In September 1834 Scott's son in law John Gibson Lockhart took the artist J. M. W. Turner to visit Craignethan. Turner made a sketch of the castle from the north, seen across the Nethan Gorge, then made several drawings in and around the ruins.|$|E
2500|$|Several novels {{based on}} early 20th century New England contain an overplayed dynamic between the dying and {{shrinking}} Yankee {{population and the}} young Polish immigrants. Polish characters typically came from large families, embodied hard work, and commonly learned English and engaged in relationships with {{the women in the}} New England towns. A 1913 novel, The Invaders, which referred to Poles as [...] "beasts" [...] and animal-like, contains a love story between a native New Englander and a Polish immigrant man. The story of amalgamation between a first-generation Polish immigrant and a white native woman is seen as a form of limited acceptance. A 1916 story, Our Naputski Neighbors, similarly depicts a lowly Polish immigrant family in New England which succeeds over its American neighbors.In the story, the younger generation changes their names and marries into a native Yankee family. The story demonstrates a cliché attitude of social and cultural inferiority that the Poles carry with them, <b>but</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> be easily solved through hygiene, education, learning English, and romantic attachments. In the 1931 story Heirs by Cornelia James Cannon, Poles are recognized as occupying a higher economic space than the protagonist Marilla. In the story, Poles who are Americanized through learning English are given higher status jobs, but she and her husband occupy a space of importance in teaching them English, as she said in one scene, [...] "You can't Americanize without Americans!". In one scene, Marilla sees two young Polish children cutting firewood and teaches them to appreciate the trees as naturalists, rather than for their purpose as fuel. The protagonist's view is somewhat condescending and elitist, although historian Stanislaus Blejwas found the tone of superiority is moderated in later novels written with Polish American characters.|$|E
