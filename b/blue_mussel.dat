40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>mussels</b> (Mytilus edulis) are ecologically and {{economically}} important marine invertebrates whose populations {{are at risk}} from climate change-associated variation in their environment, such as decreased coastal salinity. <b>Blue</b> <b>mussels</b> are osmoconfomers and use components of the metabolome (free amino acids) to help maintain osmotic balance and cellular function during low salinity exposure. However, {{little is known about}} the capacity of <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> during the planktonic larval stages to regulate metabolites during osmotic stress. Metabolite studies in species such as <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> can help improve our understanding of the species’ physiology, as well as their capacity to respond to environmental stress. We used 1 D 1 H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and 2 D total correlation spectroscopy (TOCSY) experiments to describe baseline metabolite pools in larval (veliger and pediveliger stages) and juvenile <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> (gill, mantle, and adductor tissues) under ambient conditions and to quantify changes in the abundance of common osmolytes in these stages during low salinity exposure. We found evidence for stage- and tissue-specific differences in the baseline metabolic profiles of <b>blue</b> <b>mussels,</b> which reflect variation in the function and morphology of each larval stage or tissue type of juveniles. These differences impacted the utilization of osmolytes during low salinity exposure, likely stemming from innate physiological variation. This study highlights the importance of foundational metabolomic studies that include multiple tissue types and developmental stages to adequately evaluate organismal responses to stress and better place these findings in a broader physiological context...|$|R

25|$|S. balanoides {{can be the}} {{dominant}} species of rocky shores, where it grows {{in a range of}} situations, from very sheltered to very exposed. It is typically found lower on the shore than another barnacle, Chthamalus montagui, although with some overlap. S. balanoides can tolerate salinities down to 20psu, allowing it to colonise parts of estuaries. On semi-exposed shores, S. balanoides may form a patchwork with patches of seaweeds, such as Fucus serratus, and limpets; the fronds of the seaweeds brush the barnacle larvae from the rocks, allowing limpets to colonise it instead. At the southern limit of its range, including Cornwall, S. balanoides is replaced by Chthamalus montagui. Although capable of living in the sublittoral zone, S. balanoides tends to be restricted to the intertidal by predation and by competition from species such as the <b>blue</b> <b>mussel,</b> Mytilus edulis, and the algae Ascophyllum nodosum and Chondrus crispus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>mussels</b> and reeds were {{explored}} {{as a new}} biomass type in the Kalmar County of Sweden to improve renewable transport fuel production {{in the form of}} biogas. Anaerobic digestion of <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> and reeds was performed at a laboratory-scale to evaluate biogas production in a two-stage dry digestion system. The two-stage system consisted of a leach bed reactor and an upflow anaerobic sludge blanket (UASB) reactor. The two-stage system was efficient for the digestion of <b>blue</b> <b>mussels,</b> including shells, and a methane yield of 0. 33 m(3) /kg volatile solids (VS) was obtained. The meat fraction of <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> was easily solubilised in the leach bed reactor and the soluble organic materials were rapidly converted in the UASB reactor from which 68 % of the methane was produced. However, the digestion of mussels including shells gave low production capacity, which may result in a less economically viable biogas process. A low methane potential, 0. 22 m(3) /kg VS, was obtained in the anaerobic two-stage digestion of reeds after 107 days: however, it was comparable to similar types of biomass, such as straw. About 80 % of the methane was produced in the leach bed reactor. Hence, only a leach bed reactor (dry digestion) may be needed to digest reed. The two-stage anaerobic digestion of <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> and reeds resulted in an energy potential of 16. 6 and 10. 7 GWh/year, respectively, from the estimated harvest amounts. Two-stage anaerobic digestion of new organic materials such as <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> and reeds can be a promising biomass resource as land-based biomass start to be limited and conflict with food resources can be avoided.

25|$|One of {{the more}} common methods of {{antifouling}} comes from growing polymer chains from a surface, often by poly(ethylene glycol) or PEG. However, challenges exist in creating a functionalized surface to which PEG chains may be grown, especially in aqueous environments. Researchers {{have been able to}} study the methods by which the common <b>blue</b> <b>mussel</b> Mytilus edulis is able to adhere to solid surfaces in marine environments using mussel adhesive proteins, or MAPs. MAPs typically comprise several proteins, of which the most common repeating sequence is Ala-Lys-Pro-Ser-Tyr-trans-2,3-cis-3,4-dihydroxyproline (DHP) -Hyp-Thr-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA) -Lys. The inclusion of the hydroxylated DHP and DOPA amino acids is thought to contribute to the adhesive nature of the MAPs. Recent studies have looked into using a short chain of DOPA residues as an adhesive end-group for antifouling PEG polymers which show promise in adsorbing onto certain metal surfaces. Increasing the number of DOPA residues to three greatly improves the total amount of adsorbed DOPA-PEG polymers and exhibits antifouling properties exceeding most other 'grafting-to' polymeric functionalization methods.|$|E

They are more exposed to attack by predators than the burrowing bivalves.

40|$|The {{discovery}} of microplastics (plastic particles smaller than 5 millimeters) in the world’s oceans {{has in the}} recent decade caused great concerns amongst scientists. These microplastics are widely distributed over the world’s oceans and {{have been found in}} sediments, along coasts, in the pelagic and in remote areas such as the poles. They derive from fragmented larger pieces of plastic and from industry and households wastewater. These particles are often mistaken by invertebrates as food and threatens the marine biota. The plastics are known to block the gut and intestines in the animal, which lead to a feeling of saturation. In the long run this could lead to starvation of the animal. In this study, examination has been done on <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> from the Swedish west coast, with the aim to discover the presence of microplastics in them. The <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> were diluted in nitric acid and sieved in mesh sizes of 0. 07, 0. 55 and 0. 9 millimeters. Of 120 examined <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> 80 contained microplastics and in total 147 plastic particles were found. The particles consist of fibers and fragments in the colours black, blue, red and white/yellow/transparent. The fibers strongly dominated the samples and were found in all mesh sizes. The fragments were only found in the smallest mesh size and only in a few numbers. A correlation was found between the wet weight of the mussels and their plastic containment. This study shows distinct resemblance with earlier studies of Belgian and Canadian <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> in which fibers in different colours also dominated. Unfortunately {{it is almost impossible to}} ensure the source of the plastics only by visual comparisons, to do that further analysis will be needed. The problems associated with microplastics in <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> has been shown to be a lowered filtering activity and a lower uptake of nutrient, at the same time the mussels increase its energy consumption. In the end this leads to severe malnutrition. As the <b>blue</b> <b>mussels</b> make up an important base in the nutrient web the microplastics does not only have a negative impact to themselves, but also to many predators at higher trophic levels. ...|$|R
