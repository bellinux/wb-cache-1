5|$|The Plateau Mount Royal borough was {{a working}} class francophone area. The largest {{neighbourhood}} is the Plateau (not {{to be confused}} with the whole borough), which is undergoing considerable gentrification, and a 2001 study deemed it as Canada's most creative neighbourhood because artists comprise 8% of its labour force. The neighbourhood of Mile End in the northwestern part of the borough, has been a very multicultural area of the city, and features two of Montreal's well-known <b>bagel</b> establishments, St-Viateur <b>Bagel</b> and Fairmount <b>Bagel.</b> The McGill Ghetto is in the extreme southwestern portion of the borough, its name being derived from the fact that it is home to thousands of McGill University students and faculty members.|$|E
5|$|By 1987, Cher was {{receiving}} attention for her controversial lifestyle, including her tattoos, plastic surgeries, exhibitionist fashion sense, and affairs with younger men. She had romantic relationships with actors Val Kilmer, Eric Stoltz, and Tom Cruise, hockey player Ron Duguay, film producer Josh Donen, Bon Jovi guitarist Richie Sambora, and Rob Camilletti, an 18-years-younger <b>bagel</b> baker whom she dated from 1986 to 1989.|$|E
5|$|Gom bian (also {{known as}} 光饼 or Kompia) — a Foochow {{delicacy}} made with flour, baked in an oven and eaten either {{with or without}} meat and gravy. It is somewhat similar to a <b>bagel.</b> However, it can be either in a crisp or soft version. Traditional soft kompia dipped in pork sauce can be sought from Chung Hua road and the Sunday Market at Pedada road. There are deep fried variations available throughout the town of Sibu.|$|E

50|$|In May 2012, Consumer Reports {{magazine}} rated Lender's Original {{as one of}} {{the best}} <b>bagels</b> available in the U.S., an assessment criticized by many commentators - especially in New York - who argue that only fresh <b>bagels</b> are real <b>bagels.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Bagels</b> {{and cream}} cheese were {{provided}} to theater patrons by {{the cast of}} <b>Bagels</b> and Yox, a 1951 American-Yiddish Broadway revue, during the intermission period of the show. The revue ran at the Holiday Theatre in New York City from September 1951 to February 1952. A 1951 review of <b>Bagels</b> and Yox published in Time magazine helped to popularize <b>bagels</b> to American consumers throughout the country.|$|R
5|$|During {{the clay}} season, Federer's {{victory in the}} Hamburg Masters final was {{particularly}} impressive, as it snapped Rafael Nadal's 81-match winning streak on clay, an Open-Era record. Federer turned the match around from a set down to sweep 12 of the final 14 games, including a final set <b>bagel.</b> At the French Open, some anticipated that Federer could become the first man in almost 40 years to hold all four majors simultaneously, having just resoundingly defeated young rival Nadal on clay entering the tournament. However, in {{a repeat of the}} previous year Federer played a tough four-set final against Nadal, but was undone by going 1/17 on break-point chances.|$|E
5|$|Djokovic {{would then}} suffer his own {{thrashing}} {{at the hands}} of Dominic Thiem in the quarter-finals of the French Open, when he lost in straight sets, including losing the third set 6-0, his first <b>bagel</b> at a grand slam tournament since 2005. This further emphasised that Djokovic was still very far from his best form. Following this loss, he fell to world No.4, his lowest ranking since October 2009 and his first time outside the top two of the rankings since March 2011. In contrast, Nadal breezed through to the French Open final without dropping a set, including a third round match where he only lost one game. Murray, meanwhile, bounced back from his recent poor form by reaching the semi-finals, but lost to Stan Wawrinka in a five-set epic. Nadal then defeated Wawrinka in the final to become the first player in the Open Era to win ten titles at a single slam. This win also ended a three-year drought of slam titles for the Spaniard, his last title coming at the French Open in 2014. Following the win, Nadal returned to world No. 2, his highest ranking since October 2014.|$|E
5|$|Lleyton Hewitt and Roger Federer played {{each other}} on 27 occasions. Early in their careers, Hewitt {{dominated}} Federer, winning seven of their first nine meetings, including a victory from two sets down in the 2003 Davis Cup semifinal which allowed Australia to defeat Switzerland. However, from 2004 onward, Federer dominated the rivalry, winning 16 of the last 18 meetings to finish with an 18–9 overall head-to-head record. This is Hewitt's longest rivalry as these two first played each other as juniors in 1996. They met in one Grand Slam tournament final, the 2004 US Open final, where Federer won his first US Open title in a lopsided encounter in which Federer scored a <b>bagel</b> {{on both sides of}} a second-set tiebreak. Federer met Hewitt at six of the Grand Slam tournaments in which he lifted the trophy, including all five of his triumphs between 2004 and 2005. Their last meeting was at the 2014 Brisbane International, where Hewitt triumphed over Federer in three sets for his first title since 2010, when he also beat Federer to the Halle title.|$|E
50|$|The <b>bagels</b> they {{prepared}} by hand weighed about 2 to 3 oz, with <b>bagels</b> commonly {{prepared by the}} 1990s typically being double that size, or larger. These smaller and denser <b>bagels</b> were made with high-gluten flour, mixed with malt syrup, salt, water and yeast, using a zealously guarded recipe, and would become hard after about six hours. They would be rolled into strips two inches in diameter and formed by hand into <b>bagels,</b> boiled in hot water for one minute and then placed to bake in an oven. The finished products were delivered to customers on strings of five dozen <b>bagels.</b> The profession was divided into the bench men, who were responsible for kneading, shaping and boiling the <b>bagels,</b> with the oven men finishing the job.|$|R
50|$|Further {{refinements}} were developed, such as pre-slicing the <b>bagels</b> {{and packing}} them in polyethylene bags {{to keep them}} fresh after thawing, and the bakery began selling the packaged frozen <b>bagels</b> in supermarkets. To introduce <b>bagels</b> to an unfamiliar public, the Lender family would prepare and distribute them in supermarket aisles. The plastic bagged, frozen six pack of pre-sliced Lender's Frozen <b>Bagels</b> began to gain market share, and by 1959 supermarket sales accounted for half of the sales. New varieties of <b>bagels</b> were invented, and production was switched over to rotary ovens, rather than labor-intensive open, flat ovens.|$|R

5|$|One of Smith's {{significant}} contributions to the menu was {{the addition of a}} breakfast product line as part of the 1978 product line expansion. Up until that point, breakfast was not a market Burger King had served. Other than the addition of the Croissan'Wich in 1983, the breakfast menu remained almost identical to the McDonald's offerings until a menu revamp in 1986. This expansion introduced BK's A.M. Express product line, which included French toast sticks and mini-muffins. The new breakfast line was designed to be portable, because studies had shown that an increasing percent of consumers were eating breakfast on the go. Shortly after the introduction of the French toast stick products, BK partnered with Lender's Bagels to introduce a <b>bagel</b> breakfast sandwich. The new product was designed to drive sales in the morning by piquing customer's curiosity with a new taste. The product was tested for several months in BK's original home territory of Miami before a national roll-out.|$|E
25|$|The <b>bagel</b> {{came into}} more general use {{throughout}} North America {{in the last}} quarter of the 20th century with automation. Daniel Thompson started work on the first commercially viable <b>bagel</b> machine in 1958; <b>bagel</b> baker Harry Lender, his son, Murray Lender, and Florence Sender leased this technology and pioneered automated production and distribution of frozen bagels in the 1960s. Murray also invented pre-slicing the <b>bagel.</b>|$|E
25|$|In recent years, {{a variant}} has emerged, {{producing}} what {{is sometimes called}} the steam <b>bagel.</b> To make a steam <b>bagel,</b> the boiling is skipped, and the bagels are instead baked in an oven equipped with a steam injection system. In commercial <b>bagel</b> production, the steam <b>bagel</b> process requires less labor, since bagels need only be directly handled once, at the shaping stage. Thereafter, the bagels need never be removed from their pans as they are refrigerated and then steam-baked. The steam <b>bagel</b> is {{not considered to be}} a genuine <b>bagel</b> by purists, as it results in a fluffier, softer, less chewy product more akin to a finger roll that happens to be shaped like a <b>bagel.</b> Steam bagels are considered lower quality by purists as the dough used is intentionally more alkaline. The increase in pH is to aid browning, since the steam injection process uses neutral water steam instead of an alkaline solution bath.|$|E

25|$|In distinction, the New York <b>bagel</b> {{contains}} {{salt and}} malt and is {{boiled in water}} before baking in a standard oven. The resulting <b>bagel</b> is puffy with a moist crust. The Montreal <b>bagel</b> is smaller (though with a larger hole), crunchier, and sweeter. There is a belief that New York bagels are the best due {{to the quality of}} the local water. However, this belief is heavily debated. For instance, Davidovich Bagels, made in NYC, are a recognized wholesale manufacturer of bagels that use these traditional bagel-making techniques (associated here with the Montreal-style <b>bagel),</b> including kettle boiling and plank baking in a wood fired oven.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{original}} <b>bagel</b> has a fairly well-defined recipe and method of production, {{there is no}} legal standard of identity for bagels in the United States.

25|$|At {{its most}} basic, {{traditional}} <b>bagel</b> dough contains wheat flour (without germ or bran), salt, water, and yeast leavening. Bread flour or other high gluten flours are preferred {{to create the}} firm, dense but spongy <b>bagel</b> shape and chewy texture. Most <b>bagel</b> recipes call for {{the addition of a}} sweetener to the dough, often barley malt (syrup or crystals), honey, high fructose corn syrup, sugar, with or without eggs, milk or butter. Leavening can be accomplished using a sourdough technique or a commercially produced yeast.|$|E

50|$|Murray Lender's {{marketing}} promotions put <b>bagels</b> {{into the}} public consciousness. He was traveling throughout the United States marketing Lender's Frozen <b>Bagels</b> to a country which was disdainful of frozen foods and unfamiliar with <b>bagels.</b> In response to observations that March was the slowest month for sales of frozen foods, Murray Lender led an effort to declare March as Frozen Foods Month, raising sales dramatically. In recognition of his contributions to the industry as a whole, he was elected chairman of the National Frozen Food Association, nominated to the Halls of Fame of the International Deli-Bakery Association, and the Frozen Food Association. In response to the public's growing consciousness of health foods and the drop in popularity of white bread, he began to stress <b>bagels</b> as more natural baked goods, and Lender's <b>Bagels</b> {{became one of the}} first products to voluntarily include nutritional information on the package.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1997 New York Times article, Eric Asimov {{described}} {{what he called}} the [...] "informal border separating the land of fresh <b>bagels</b> from the frontier of the frozen assembly-line product made by Lender's Bagels" [...] as [...] "the Lender's Line."Murray Lender appeared as a guest on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson.
