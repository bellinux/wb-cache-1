Type IIA topoisomerases decatenate, unknot, and relax supercoiling in DNA to levels below equilibrium, resulting in global topology simplification.

The <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> model postulates that non-equilibrium topology simplification scales with the <b>bend</b> <b>angle</b> imposed on the G-segment DNA by a type IIA topoisomerase.

50|$|Gravitropism is {{a turning}} or growth {{movement}} by a plant or fungus {{in response to}} gravity. It is equally widespread in both kingdoms. Statolites are required in both fungi and plants for the mechanism of gravity-sensing. The Zygomycota sporangiophores originate from specialized “basal hyphae” and pass through several distinctive developmental stages until the mature asexual spores are released. In addition to the positive phototropism, the sporangiophores are directed by a negative gravitropic response into a position suitable for spore dispersal and distribution. Both responses are growth reactions i.e. the bending is caused by differential growth on the respective opposite flanks of the sporangiophore, and influence each other. The only model for the mechanism of the gravitropic reaction of Phycomyces {{is based on the}} floatability of the vacuole within the surrounding cytoplasm. The resulting asymmetric distribution of the cytoplasm is proposed to generate increased wall growth on the lower side of horizonally placed sporangiophores as in the thicker cytoplasmic layer forming there the number of vesicles secreting cell-wall material would be higher than on the upper side. Gravitropic bending starts after approximately 15 - 30 min in horizontally placed sporangiophores and continues until after, approximately 12 - 14 hours, the sporangiophore tip has recovered its original vertical position. Usually, the gravitropic response is weaker compared to the phototrophic one. However, in certain conditions, equilibrium could be established and the responses are comparable. In plants and fungi, phototropism and gravitropism interact in a complex manner. During continuous irradiation with unilateral light, the sporangiophore (fruiting body) of the zygomycete fungus, Phycomyces blakesleeanus reach a <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> of photogravitropic equilibrium at which the gravitropic and phototropic stimuli balance each other (Fig. 1, <b>bending</b> <b>angle</b> +α, due to light irradiation).|$|E
