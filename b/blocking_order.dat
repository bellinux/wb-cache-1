The Act further permits the use of classified information which will be subjected to only ex parte, in camera inspection by the judge presiding over a challenge to such an action as a means of supporting the government’s actions in freezing such assets. This article addresses the question of whether the government’s use of secret evidence to justify a challenged <b>blocking</b> <b>order</b> pursuant to the provisions of the Patriot Act represents a violation of the fundamental due process rights of an aggrieved party. The article first examines the rapidly developing body of legal precedent emerging from recent challenges to such blocking orders and the Government’s efforts to enforce such orders through the submission of “confidential and sensitive” evidence on an ex parte, in camera basis. The article also examines the legal and public policy arguments, both in favor of and against the continued use of such ex parte, in camera evidence as a part of judicial proceedings challenging blocking orders as well as some of the potential ramifications of such a course of action. What emerges from this analysis is the determination that while the provisions of the Act relating to the ex parte, in camera submission of evidence supporting the government’s allegations are alarming at first glance, the ultimate goal of cracking down on money laundering as an increasingly potent source of terrorist financing can only be supported by broad enforcement capabilities held in check by the unbiased members of the judiciary...|$|E

40|$|We {{have used}} the whole-cell patch-clamp {{technique}} to analyse the permeation properties and ionic block of the epithelial Ca 2 + channel ECaC heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. Cells dialysed with 10 mM BAPTA and exposed to Ca 2 +-containing, monovalent cation-free solutions displayed large inwardly rectifying currents. Their reversal potential depended on the extracellular Ca 2 + concentration, [Ca 2 +]o. The slope {{of the relationship between}} reversal potential and [Ca 2 +]o on a logarithmic scale was 21 +/- 4 mV, compared with 29 mV as predicted by the Nernst equation (n = 3 - 5 cells). Currents in mixtures of Ca 2 + and Na+ or Ca 2 + and Ba 2 + showed anomalous mole fraction behaviour. We have described the current-concentration plot for Ca 2 + and Na+ by a kinetic permeation model, i. e. the "step" model. Extracellular Mg 2 + blocked both divalent and monovalent currents with an IC 50 of 62 +/- 9 microM(n = 4) in Ca 2 +-free conditions and 328 +/- 50 microM (n = 4 - 9) in 100 microM Ca 2 + solutions. Mono- and divalent currents through ECaCs were blocked by gadolinium, lanthanum and cadmium, with a <b>blocking</b> <b>order</b> of Cd 2 + >> Gd 3 + > La 3 +. We conclude that the permeation of monovalent and divalent cations through ECaCs shows similarities with L-type voltage-gated Ca 2 + channels, the main differences being a higher Ca 2 + affinity and a significantly higher current density in micromolar Ca 2 + concentrations in the case of ECaCs. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRespiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is an {{important}} human respiratory pathogen, particularly in infants. Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) have been implicated in the initiation of RSV infection of cultured cells, {{but it is not}} clear what type of GAGs and GAG components are involved, whether the important GAGs are on the virus or the cell, or what the magnitude is of their contribution to infection. We constructed and rescued a recombinant green fluorescent protein (GFP) -expressing RSV (rgRSV) and used this virus to develop a sensitive system to assess and quantify infection by flow cytometry. Evaluation of a panel of mutant Chinese hamster ovary cell lines that are genetically deficient in various aspects of GAG synthesis showed that infection was reduced up to 80 % depending on the type of GAG deficiency. Enzymatic removal of heparan sulfate and/or chondroitin sulfate from the surface of HEp- 2 cells also reduced infection, and the removal of both reduced infection even further. Blocking experiments in which RSV was preincubated with various soluble GAGs revealed the relative <b>blocking</b> <b>order</b> of: heparin > heparan sulfate > chondroitin sulfate B. Iduronic acid is a component common to these GAGs. GAGs that do not contain iduronic acid, namely, chondroitin sulfate A and C and hyaluronic acid, did not inhibit infection. A role for iduronic acid-containing GAGs in RSV infection was confirmed by the ability of basic fibroblast growth factor to block infection, because basic fibroblast growth factor binds to GAGs containing iduronic acid. Pretreatment of cells with protamine sulfate, which binds and blocks GAGs, also reduced infection. In these examples, infection was reduced by pretreatment of the virus with soluble GAGs, pretreatment of the cells with GAG-binding molecules, pretreatment of the cells with GAG-destroying enzymes or in cells genetically deficient in GAGs. These results establish that the GAGs involved in RSV infection are present on the cell rather than on the virus particle. Thus, the presence of cell surface GAGs containing iduronic acid, like heparan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate B, is required for efficient RSV infection in cell culture...|$|E
40|$|Information and Communications Technology (ICT) {{companies}} like Google/YouTube, Facebook, Yahoo, and Twitter {{are in control}} of an enormous amount of expression on the Internet. More so than any individual country, these companies are responsible for making decisions with regard to a vast amount of Internet expression. They host billions of pages of Internet content, while responding on a daily basis to countless requests from countries and individuals around the world to take down content that is deemed objectionable or illegal. These powerful ICT companies have become the de facto sovereigns of cyberspace, with the power to balance freedom of expression against public and private interests on a day-to-day basis, as they make determinations about whether and when to accede to requests to censor speech. Google, for example, is responsible for facilitating seventy-one percent of the world’s Internet searches. As the owner of YouTube, Google is also responsible for hosting one hundred hours of new video content that users post every minute. Executives at Google are responsible for making determinations about which controversial content stays up and which comes down. Twitter decision-makers enjoy similar, vast power to determine which of the one billion tweets sent every five days get disseminated around the world and which get blocked. The same goes for Facebook, Yahoo, and other global ICT giants. What guidelines should these companies follow in determining which content to facilitate and which to take down? Under what circumstances should ICT companies accede to governments’ or individuals’ requests to censor content? How, if at all, should they implement such censorship requests? Given that most of these powerful companies are U. S. based, some have contended that these companies should implement the United States’ speech-protective values and refuse censorship requests from other, less speech-protective countries. For example, if France requests that a U. S. based ICT company like Yahoo block content that violates French hate-speech laws, Yahoo arguably should simply ignore the request and export the First Amendment to other countries. But after a French court decision in 2000 rendered Yahoo criminally liable in France for failing to block French citizens’ access to certain hate speech content it hosted, Yahoo – and other global ICT companies – began to rethink this approach. Although initially resisting France’s power to influence what content Yahoo hosts – resulting in lengthy legal battles –Yahoo ultimately modified its policies to prohibit hosting of hate speech content. Instead of Yahoo exporting the First Amendment, it would seem in this instance that France exported its own less speech-protective laws to the U. S. {{and the rest of the}} world. How should global ICT companies respond to countries’ requests to censor content in light of the Yahoo-France dispute, in which France asserted the power to seize Yahoo’s local assets and detain local Yahoo executives for failing to comply with its laws? Is there a middle ground between imposing the First Amendment on the rest of the world, and acceding to every other country’s speech-restrictive censorship requests? How should global ICT companies balance these myriad competing concerns, amidst vastly conflicting regional free speech regimes?In this chapter, I argue that ICT companies should adopt and implement a set of procedural guidelines embodying principles of digital due process that protect the due process rights that are essential to democratic societies, while respecting the autonomy of each democratic society to determine the contours of substantive free speech rights for its citizens. Protecting due process rights is the first step in protecting and respecting human rights, which transnational corporations – as well as countries – have a duty to protect. As United Nations’ Special Representative of the Secretary-General emphasized in his “Protect, Respect and Remedy” framework, business enterprises as well as nations have a duty to respect human rights. An important part of respecting human rights is respecting the rights of individuals to receiving due process in the protection of their rights. ICT companies should adopt and implement a set of due process principles that, I argue, are implicit in the free speech and due process jurisprudence of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the European Convention on Human Rights, and the United States Constitution. Before implementing any country’s request that they block content, ICT companies should (1) ensure that the requesting country has articulated within its laws a narrow, specific description of what speech is illegal, to confine the discretion of decision-makers and to provide fair notice to individuals of what speech is illegal in the first instance; (2) ensure that affected parties have received notice in cases where their speech has been deemed illegal and have had the opportunity to be heard in a fair, independent, and impartial proceeding before a censorship decision is ordered; (3) require that the requesting country has issued a narrowly tailored, final judicial decision adjudicating the subject speech as illegal; (4) implement the resulting <b>blocking</b> <b>order</b> only within the country mandating such blocking; and (5) implement the resulting <b>blocking</b> <b>order</b> in an open and transparent manner...|$|E

40|$|The European market {{clearing}} {{problem is}} characterized by a set of heterogeneous orders and rules that force the implementation of heuristic and iterative solving methods. In particular, curtailable <b>block</b> <b>orders</b> and the uniform purchase price (UPP) pose serious difficulties. A <b>block</b> is an <b>order</b> that spans over multiple hours, and can be either fully accepted or fully rejected. The UPP prescribes that all consumers pay a common price, i. e., the UPP, in all the zones, while producers receive zonal prices, which can differ from one zone to another. The market clearing problem in the presence of both the UPP and <b>block</b> <b>orders</b> is a major open issue in the European context. The UPP scheme leads to a non-linear optimization problem involving both primal and dual variables, whereas <b>block</b> <b>orders</b> introduce multi-temporal constraints and binary variables into the problem. As a consequence, the market clearing problem in the presence of both blocks and the UPP can be regarded as a non-linear integer programming problem involving both primal and dual variables with complementary and multi-temporal constraints. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a heuristic-free, exact and computationally tractable model, which solves the market clearing problem in the presence of both curtailable <b>block</b> <b>orders</b> and the UPP.

40|$|Abstract — The {{amount of}} energy {{consumed}} for interconnect-ing the IP-blocks is increasing significantly due to the subopti-mal scaling of long wires. To limit this energy penalty, segmented buses have gained interest in the architectural community. How-ever, the netlist topology and the physical design stage signifi-cantly influence the final communication energy cost. We present in this paper an automated way to implement a netlist consist-ing of hard macro blocks, which are interconnected with heavily segmented buses in an energy optimal fashion for communication. We optimize the network wires energy dissipation in two separate, but related steps: minimizing the number of segments for active communication paths at the first step (<b>block</b> <b>ordering),</b> followed by the activity aware floorplanning step to minimize the physical length of these segments. Energy gains of up to a factor of 4 are achieved compared to a standard system implementation using a shared bus.
