40|$|At {{an optimal}} {{value of the}} noise intensity, the maximum {{variability}} in rebound <b>burst</b> <b>durations</b> is observed and {{referred to as a}} response stochastic incoherence. A general mechanism underlying this phenomenon is given, being different from those reported so far in excitable systems. It is shown to be determined by (i) the monotonic reduction of the hysteresis responsible for bursting caused by noise and consequent transformation of responses from rebound bursts to single spikes, and (ii) a symmetry breaking in distributions of <b>burst</b> <b>durations</b> caused by the existence of the minimum response length. The phenomenon is studied numerically in a Morris-Lecar model for neurons and its mechanism is explained with the use of canonical models describing hard excitation states...|$|R
40|$|We study {{correlations}} between various hardness ratios of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and investigate {{if there are}} any differences between the two classes of the objects in the distributions of the ratios. The results suggest that, statistically, the slope of the higher part of the spectrum of the long <b>duration</b> <b>bursts</b> {{has nothing to do with}} that of the lower part; emissions at higher energy bands from the bursts of both short and long duration classes must be significantly different for different sources, while radiations at lower energy bands of the objects are relatively similar; the spectrum of the short <b>duration</b> <b>bursts</b> must be harder than that of the long <b>duration</b> <b>bursts,</b> confirming what the well-known hardness-duration correlation reveals; the profiles of the spectra between the long <b>duration</b> <b>bursts</b> must be more similar than that between the short <b>duration</b> <b>bursts.</b> The long <b>duration</b> <b>bursts</b> would share more common properties than the short <b>duration</b> <b>bursts.</b> A possible interpretation is proposed with the concept of the Doppler boosting in the relativistic beaming model in AGNs.

Periodic behavior in traffic observed on the Internet is growing due to the increasing amount of services with video components.

50|$|Burst {{suppression}} patterns can {{be classified}} through comparisons of <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> and inter-burst intervals, maximum peak to peak voltage, and the ratio of power in high versus low frequencies. (Akrawi et al., 1996) Burst suppression with identical bursts suggests a deterministic process of burst generation, whereas other burst suppression patterns depend on stochastic processes. Burst suppression with identical bursts is a distinct pathological EEG pattern that is typical in diffuse cerebral ischemia and is associated with poor outcomes in comatose patients after cardiac arrest.|$|E
50|$|How {{does the}} fish {{know which way}} to turn? The {{directionality}} of the tuberous receptors seems {{to be controlled by}} the current flow through the fish’s skin. The <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> coders encode the amplitude by the number of spikes while the Pulse marker receptors encode timing. When the electric field is lined up at the best axis to the receptor, it will produce the strongest signal. This is the case if the electric field is lined up perpendicularly with the receptor. If the fish is lined up with the field, both sides of the fish are stimulated equally in amplitude and the direction of the signals. When the electric field turns to the fish’s left, receptors on the left side will be more strongly stimulated with perpendicular signals on the fish’s left side while the receptors on the right side would receive a weaker stimulus. The fish will turn {{to the side of the}} stronger stimulus. Using the receptors, the fish can detect field and orient itself to the electric field to follow the electric field and locate its source.|$|E
50|$|Researchers at Harvard University {{have created}} a brain-to-brain {{interface}} (BBI) between a human and a Sprague-Dawley rat. Simply by thinking the appropriate thought, the BBI allows the human to control the rat's tail. The human wears an EEG-based brain-to-computer interface (BCI), while the anesthetised rat {{is equipped with a}} focused ultrasound (FUS) computer-to-brain interface (CBI). FUS is a technology that allows the researchers to excite a specific region of neurons in the rat's brain using an ultrasound signal (350 kHz ultrasound frequency, tone <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> of 0.5 ms, pulse repetition frequency of 1 kHz, given for 300 ms duration). The main advantage of FUS is that, unlike most brain-stimulation techniques, it is non-invasive. Whenever the human looks at a specific pattern (strobe light flicker) on a computer screen, the BCI communicates a command to the rat's CBI, which causes ultrasound to be beamed into the region of the rat's motor cortex responsible for tail movement. The researchers report that the human BCI has an accuracy of 94%, and that it generally takes around 1.5 s from the human looking at the screen to movement of the rat's tail.|$|E
40|$|The {{extracellular}} patch-clamp {{technique was}} used to examine how halothane, a general anesthetic, affects the properties of single nicotinic acetylcholine receptor channels of embryonic Xenopus skeletal muscle cells grown in culture. Under control conditions, single-channel events showed a bimodal distribution on the basis of current amplitudes. This distribution was maintained during exposure to halothane and its washout. In addition, the mean current value of the low-and high-amplitude channels was unaffected by the presence of the anesthetic at clinically relevant concentrations. In contrast, halothane shortened the <b>burst</b> <b>durations</b> of both channel types in a concentration-dependent manner. This shortening of <b>burst</b> <b>durations</b> may be an expression of the more rapid relaxation of the channel protein to the nonconducting state, possibly due to the disordering effect of the anesthetic on membrane lipids in which the receptor protein is embedded. This functional change, in the behavior of the synaptic receptor, provides further direct information on the mode of action of general anesthetics...|$|R
40|$|A {{workload}} model {{using the}} infinite source Poisson model for bursts {{is combined with}} the on [...] off model for within <b>burst</b> activity. <b>Burst</b> <b>durations</b> and on [...] off durations are assumed to have heavy-tailed distributions with infinite variance and finite mean. Since the number of bursts is random, one can consider limiting results based on "random centering" of a random sum for the total workload from all sources. Convergence results are shown {{to depend on the}} tail indices of both the on [...] off durations and the lifetimes distributions. Moreover, the results can be separated into cases depending on those tail indices. In one case where all distributions are heavy tailed it is shown that the limiting result is Brownian motion. In another case, convergence to fractional Brownian motion is shown, where the Hurst parameter depends on the heavy-tail indices of the distribution of the on, off and <b>burst</b> <b>durations.</b> Comment: Published in at [URL] the Brazilian Journal of Probability and Statistics ([URL] by the Brazilian Statistical Association/Institute of Mathematical Statistics ([URL]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Digital Video Broadcasting for Handheld {{terminals}} (DVB-H) is assuming an ever growing {{importance for}} digital video transmission over wireless terminals. In such a context, Time Slicing has been implemented {{to achieve a}} better power saving and manage handover. Specifically, a generic user transmits bursts of data, interspaced by time periods in which no data are transmitted. In this paper, to improve time sliced multiservice transmission effectiveness, the Variable Burst Time (VBT) algorithm is presented and discussed. It dynamically varies the whole set of stream <b>Burst</b> <b>Durations</b> according to input stream data, available channel bandwidth, receiving buffer size and eventually stream priority. <b>Burst</b> <b>Durations</b> are derived by the minimization of a Total Loss Function (TLF) representing the amount of losses of the whole service set. Numerical results show the VBT effectiveness if compared with the time sliced transmission recommended in the DVB guidelines, for different numbers, types and quality degrees of VBR streams, receiving buffer sizes and stream priorities. This suggests that VBT could be efficiently exploited for transmission of VBR streams in DVB-H systems...|$|R
5000|$|In sharks, the Ampullae of Lorenzini is the ampullary organ used {{to detect}} {{electrical}} stimuli. These cells are distributed along the dorsal and ventral head region of the sharks, but are {{also found in the}} pectoral region in skates and rays. The receptor is located in clusters, with a higher density of receptors on the ventral side of the head than the dorsal side of the head, but density and canal length varies by individual and species. The species of teleosts with electroreception (Gymnotiformes, Mormyridae, and Silurids) are freshwater fish and therefore have smaller ampullary canals than marine species. Mormyrids have ampullary ducts distributed on the head as well as along {{the top and bottom of}} their body. Silurids have most ampullary organs in the head skin, but ampullary receptors are also found along the body side. Gymnotids have ampullary organs distributed on the head as well as scattered along the side of the body. Besides having ampullary receptors, teleost fish possess tuberous receptors, which come in two types: pulse marker receptors that code for the amplitude of the signal, and <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> coders that code for the timing of the signal. [...] Both of these receptors are directional in their responses to the electrical fields. The receptors are scattered across the head and body of the fish, directionally selective, and the best response is when the current is perpendicular to the skin.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To study motor {{activation}} {{patterns of}} voluntary and reflex cough adjusted for cough flow rates. METHODS: Surface electromyography (EMG) and cough flow rate were measured in 10 healthy volunteers. Voluntary cough was assessed for 20 efforts in each quintile of increasing cough flow rate. Reflex cough was assessed for 25 efforts produced by nebulised l-tartaric acid. EMG was recorded over the expiratory (rectus abdominis, obliques, lower intercostals) and accessory (trapezius, pectoralis major, deltoid, latissimus dorsi) muscles. EMG activity, <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> and onset were compared for each quintile of voluntary cough, and between voluntary and reflex cough matched for cough flow rate. RESULTS: EMG activity and <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> of expiratory and accessory muscles during voluntary cough increased {{in proportion to}} cough flow. Expiratory muscles had longer EMG <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> (difference 68 ms (95 % CI 34 to 102), p< 0. 01) and earlier onset of EMG activity (difference 44 ms (95 % CI 20 to 68), p< 0. 0001) compared with accessory muscles. EMG activity in all muscles was increased (mean 110. 2 % v 56. 1 %, p< 0. 001) and <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> (mean 206 ms v 280 ms, p = 0. 013) decreased in reflex cough compared with voluntary cough of equal flow rate. There were no differences in EMG onset (difference 8 ms (95 % CI 25 to - 9) or <b>burst</b> <b>duration</b> (difference 27 ms (95 % CI 58 to - 4) between expiratory and accessory muscles. CONCLUSIONS: Functional organisation of motor activity differs between voluntary and reflex cough. Voluntary cough is characterised by sequential activation whereas reflex cough is associated with early and simultaneous activation of expiratory and accessory muscles...|$|E

40|$|The glycine {{receptor}} (GlyR) is a ligand-gated {{ion channel}} {{and member of}} the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor superfamily. Acting as allosteric modulators of receptor function, drugs such as alcohol and volatile anesthetics enhance the function of GlyRs. The actions of these drugs at inhibitory receptors in the brain and spinal cord are thought to produce many of the physiological effects associated with their use. The actions of ethanol on the GlyR have been well studied on the macroscopic, whole cell level. We examined the effects of 3 μM glycine ± 50 or 200 mM ethanol on outside-out patches pulled from Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing wild-type α 1 GlyR, {{to determine the effects of}} alcohol at the single-channel level. Alcohol enhanced GlyR function in a very specific manner. It had minimal effects on open and closed dwell times and likelihood. Instead, ethanol potentiated GlyR function almost exclusively by increasing <b>burst</b> <b>durations</b> and increasing the number of channel openings per burst, without affecting the percentage of open time within bursts.

We show that the properties of these bursts {{are similar to those}} of Soft Gamma-Repeaters (SGRs). The similarities we find are the <b>burst</b> <b>durations</b> follow a log-normal distribution which peaks at 99 ms, the differential burst fluence distribution is well described by a power law of index - 1. 7, the burst fluences are positively correlated with the <b>burst</b> <b>durations,</b> the distribution of waiting times is well described by a log-normal distribution of mean 47 s, and the bursts are generally asymmetric with faster rise than fall times. However, we find several quantitative differences between the AXP and SGR bursts. Specifically, the AXP bursts we observed exhibit a wider range of durations, the correlation between <b>burst</b> fluence and <b>duration</b> is flatter than for SGRs, the observed AXP bursts are on average less energetic than observed SGR bursts, and the more energetic AXP bursts have the hardest spectra [...] the opposite of what is seen for SGRs. We conclude that the bursts are sufficiently similar that AXPs and SGRs can be considered united as a source class yet there are some interesting differences that may help determine what physically differentiates the two closely related manifestations of neutron stars.

40|$|ABSTRACT The voltage-dependent gating of {{transient}} A 2 -type potassium channels from primary {{cultures of}} larval Drosophila {{central nervous system}} neurons was studied using whole-cell and single-channel voltage clamp. A ~ channels are genetically distinct from the Shaker A 1 channels observed in Drosophila muscle, and differ in single-channel conductance, voltage dependence, and gating kinetics. Single A 2 channels were recorded and analyzed at- 30,- 10, + 10, and + 30 mV. The channels opened in bursts in response to depolarizing steps, with three to four openings per burst and two to three bursts per 480 -ms pulse (2. 8 -ms burst criterion). Mean open durations were {{in a range of}} 2 - 4 ms and mean <b>burst</b> <b>durations</b> in a range of 9 - 17 ms. With the exception of the first latency distributions, none of the means of the distributions measured showed a consistent trend with voltage. Macroscopic inactivation of both whole-cell A currents and ensemble average currents of single A 2 channels was well fitted by a sum of two exponentials. The fast time constants in different cells were in a range of 9 - 25 ms, and the slow time constants in a range of 60 - 140 ms. A six-state kinetic model (three closed, one open, two inactivated states) was tested at four command voltages by fitting frequency histograms of open <b>durations,</b> <b>burst</b> <b>durations,</b> <b>burst</b> closed <b>durations,</b> number of openings per burst, and number of bursts per trace.

The spatial-temporal be-haviour of LFEs provides insight into deep fault zone processes. In this study, we examine recurrence times from a 12 -yr catalogue of 88 LFE families with ∼ 730 000 LFEs in the vicin-ity of the Parkfield section of the San Andreas Fault (SAF) in central California. We apply an automatic burst detection algorithm to the LFE recurrence times to identify the clustering be-haviour of LFEs (LFE bursts) in each family.
