My heart and my <b>best</b> <b>intentions</b> still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} {{evidence}} tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own beliefs, to administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E

Poland also claimed the whole of Livonia, without accepting Swedish rule of any part of it.

5|$|The Capcom Five {{announcement}} {{came at a}} {{time when}} Nintendo had been struggling with its new console, with the apparent goal of supporting the fledgling system. However, each successive game's release reinforced Capcom's view that the GameCube was unprofitable; they ported the games one-by-one to Sony's PlayStation 2. These ports were generally inferior in quality: many reviewers noted slowdown issues and lower resolution graphics. Ultimately, four games were released and only one remained exclusive to GameCube. This lone GameCube exclusive was P.N.03 and not Resident Evil 4, as Capcom had repeatedly emphasized in press releases. GameCube owners and Nintendo fans were disappointed by the Capcom Five's failure to improve the GameCube's reputation and sales. Luke Plunkett of Kotaku noted that despite <b>best</b> <b>intentions,</b> Capcom's five even at their full potential could not have made up for the GameCube's failings in that generation's console wars. The dramatic reversal of the five is representative of the attitudes of third-party developers toward Nintendo's platform.|$|E

25|$|C-PTSD is also {{characterized}} by attachment disorder, particularly the pervasive insecure, or disorganized-type attachment. DSM-IV (1994) dissociative disorders and PTSD {{do not include}} insecure attachment in their criteria. As a consequence of this aspect of C-PTSD, when some adults with C-PTSD become parents and confront their own children's attachment needs, they may have particular difficulty in responding sensitively especially to their infants' and young children's routine distress—such as during routine separations, despite these parents' <b>best</b> <b>intentions</b> and efforts. Although {{the great majority of}} survivors do not abuse others, this difficulty in parenting may have adverse repercussions for their children's social and emotional development if parents with this condition and their children do not receive appropriate treatment.|$|E

In nuclear power’s heydey, its proponents saw no competitors but central coal-fired power stations. Then, in quick succession, came end-use efficiency, combined-cycle plants, distributed generation (including versions that recovered valuable heat previously wasted), and competitive windpower. The range of competitors will only continue to expand more and their costs to fall faster than any nuclear technology can match.|$|E

The Monthly Musical Record felt [...] "There was ... good reason in introducing [...] as a duet, with a view to familiarizing hearers with it beforehand", and the Musical Standard found that presenting the two-piano arrangement was [...] "an immense help to those who wished to form a correct judgment on it at its first orchestral performance ... as it is impossible, with even the <b>best</b> <b>intentions,</b> to estimate correctly the larger works of Liszt after only one hearing." ...|$|E

The song has a sequence of D–G–C–F–B–D in the verses and E5–D5–C5–D5 in the chorus, as its chord progression. The lyrics of [...] "4 Minutes" [...] carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed. Jon Pareles of The New York Times stated that [...] "owever, the song sounds as if four minutes is the time taken for a song to be a guaranteed pop hit or the time required for a quickie; in reality it is the only song from Hard Candy album which contains a message of social awareness in it." [...] The sound of a clock ticking away emphasizes this message further. Madonna explained in New York magazine that the line [...] "The road to hell is paved with good intentions" [...] did not relate to her charity work.

500|$|A {{writer for}} Disney.com observed, [...] "The creepiness of this song {{lies in the}} fact that the very untrustworthy Mother Gothel is {{positioning}} herself as a helpful figure to Rapunzel." [...] Brian Galindo of BuzzFeed wrote that the song, its purpose having been summarized by Curt Holman of Creative Loafing as [...] "simply to manipulate Rapunzel into staying at home," [...] "perfectly disguises Mother Gothel's true motives." [...] According to Simon Miraudo of Quickflix, Gothel craftily uses the song to guilt trip Rapunzel [...] "into staying in the tower ... frightened into imagining the horrors that lay outside her door." [...] In her book How Fairy Tales Live Happily Ever After: (Analyzing) the Art of Adapting Fairy Tales, author Conny Eisfeld observed that [...] "Mother Knows Best" [...] emphasizes Gothel's [...] "status of superiority", in spite of the fact that [...] "her existence solely depend on Rapunzel." [...] Bitch identified Gothel as an abusive mother, writing, [...] "she is manipulative, dishonest, and dedicated to undermining her daughter's independence. This is shown consistently through all her appearances in the film, but comes out clearly very early indeed, with the song 'Mother Knows Best'. Critics have often identified the sequence as one of the film's darkest and edgiest moments. Acknowledging the song's [...] "extremely dark undertone", Anthony Falco of Film Class Junkies wrote, [...] "This song rues in the fact that a child is impressionable; Rapunzel believes that Mother Gothel has the <b>best</b> <b>intentions,</b> but obviously, the evil witch is using the princess for her own gains. Falco continued, [...] "The audience knows what Gothel wants with Rapunzel, but the fact that we are unable to protect the naïve princess results in further hatred for the witch." [...] Falco also concluded that Gothel's [...] "sinister reprise at the end of Tangled allows for these horrifying undertones to emerge, which makes 'Mother Knows Best' one of the most sinister villain songs in the Disney library." [...] Similarly, Elissa Smith of Paper Droids wrote that while the audience is fully aware of Gothel's evil intentions, Rapunzel is denied [...] "the outsider's point of view." [...] Glen Chapman of Den of Geek wrote that the scene [...] "strikes a balance between melodic and narrative sophistication, as well as being equal parts sweet and sinister."
