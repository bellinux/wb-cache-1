40|$|In {{spite of}} decades-long studies, the {{mechanism}} of morphogenesis of plus-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the genus Enterovirus of Picornaviridae, including poliovirus (PV), is not understood. Numerous attempts to identify an RNA encapsidation signal have failed. Genetic studies, however, have implicated a role of the non-structural protein 2 C ATPase {{in the formation of}} poliovirus particles. Here we report a novel mechanism in which protein-protein interaction is sufficient to explain the specificity in PV encapsidation. Making use of a novel ‘‘reporter virus’’, we show that a quasi-infectious chimera consisting of the capsid precursor of C-cluster coxsackie virus 20 (C-CAV 20) and the nonstructural proteins of the closely related PV translated and replicated its genome with wild type kinetics, whereas encapsidation was blocked. On <b>blind</b> <b>passages,</b> encapsidation of the chimera was rescued by a single mutation either in capsid protein VP 3 of CAV 20 or in 2 C ATPase of PV. Whereas each of the single-mutation variants expressed severe proliferation phenotypes, engineering both mutations into the chimera yielded a virus encapsidating with wild type kinetics. Biochemical analyses provided strong evidence for a direct interaction between 2 C ATPase and VP 3 of PV and CAV 20. Chimeras of other C-CAVs (CAV 20 /CAV 21 or CAV 18 /CAV 20) were blocked in encapsidation (no virus after <b>blind</b> <b>passages)</b> but could be rescued if the capsid and 2 C ATPase coding regions originated from the same virus. Our novel mechanism explains the specificity of encapsidation without apparent involvement of an RNA signal by considering that (i) genome replication is known to be stringently linked t...|$|R

However, it is blocked by dynasore, amiloride, and EIPA. Furthermore, HRV 8 v induced FITC-dextran uptake and colocalized with this fluid phase marker.

The most sensitive system for mouse-passaged Sindbis and MVE viruses was inoculation of 10 -day-old chick embryos onto the chorio-allantoic membrane. Mouse-passaged Getah virus had no infectivity for chick embryos inoculated by the yolk sac or allantoic cavity, or for chickens inoculated intracerebrally, but focal lesions were produced on the chorio-allantoic membrane after inoculation by this route.

From 2 nd to 4 th generation, intraperitoneal passage was tried with 10 (- 1), 0. 4 ml hepatolienal emulsion of conditional mice: in the 1 st group of the 1 st generation that employed intraperitoneal inoculation, the survived during the observation or the suceumbed to infection and yet Rickettsia in their peritoneal fluid was not proved on the microscope, while then in the 2 nd group of the 1 st generation that employed intracutaneous inoculation, for all mice, living or dead.

The {{purpose of the present}} study was to analyse the incidence of EHV- 2 in an Argentinean horse population and correlate it with age and clinical status of the animals. Results A serological study on 153 thoroughbred racing horses confirmed the presence of EHV- 2 in the Argentinean equine population. A virus neutralization test showed a total of 79. 7 % animals were sero-positive for EHV- 2. An increase in antibodies titre with age as well as infection at earlier ages were observed.

The genetic characterization of R 1 ΔgC and R 2 ΔgI showed {{that they are}} composed of different sections of the parental genomes. The {{aim of this study}} was the characterization of the in vivo behavior of these recombinants in the natural host. Results Four groups of four 3 -month-old calves of both genders were intranasally inoculated with either the recombinant or parental viruses. A control group of two animals was also included. Viral excretion and clinical signs were monitored after infection. Histopathological examination of the central nervous system (CNS) was performed and the establishment of latency in trigeminal ganglia was analyzed by PCR. The humoral response was also evaluated using ELISA tests. Three out of four animals from the BoHV- 5 infected group excreted virus for 4 - 10 days. Two calves shed R 1 ΔgC virus for one day. In R 2 ΔgI and BoHV- 1. 2 ΔgCΔgI groups, infectious virus was isolated only after two or three <b>blind</b> <b>passages.</b> None of the infected animals developed neurological signs, although those infected with BoHV- 5 showed histopathological evidence of viral infection. Latent viral DNA was detected in at least one calf from each infected group. Serum and/or mucosal antibodies were detected in all groups. Conclusion Both BoHV- 1 /- 5 recombinants and the BoHV- 1 parental strain are attenuated in calves, although they are able to replicate in animals at low rates and to establish latent infections. </p...|$|R
40|$|Previous study {{revealed}} that a recombinant virus between poliovirus (isolate PJ 156) and coxsackie A virus serotype 17 (CAV- 17), namely PJ 156 /CAV- 17, was temperature sensitive. It {{is well known that}} two amino acids in 3 D region (His- 73 and Ile- 362) are determinants for temperature sensitivity of poliovirus, in particular for Sabin 1 strain. However, it is not known whether those amino acids affect the temperature sensitivity for other enteroviruses. Sequence analysis of 3 D region of PJ 156 /CAV- 17 showed that amino acid in 3 D- 73 and - 362 were Tyr and Ile, respectively, similar with the sequence of parental CAV- 17 virus. Since amino acid in 3 D- 73 of PJ 156 /CAV- 17 was not His, it is suggested that the temperature sensitivity of the PJ 156 /CAV- 17 was associated with the Ile- 362. To confirm this suggestion, the temperature-sensitive escape mutants of PJ 156 /CAV- 17 were generated by <b>blind</b> <b>passaging</b> at 39. 5 oC. The escape mutants were then recovered and plaque purified, and the sequence of 3 D region was determined. It was found that the amino acid in 3 D- 362 was Thr, instead of Ile. Consequently, Ile- 362 was proved to be involved in temperature sensitivity of PJ 156 /CAV- 17. Full sequences of both viruses were also determined and compared. Furthermore, the characteristics of the temperature resistant of PJ 156 /CAV- 17 variant were analyzed. It is confirmed that the recovered PJ 156 /CAV- 17 virus could grow well at 39. 5 oC, and there was strong correlation between temperature sensitivity and attenuation...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} isolate rhinoviruses in human {{heteroploid}} cell cultures was investigated by inoculating HeLa cells (HeLa M) with specimens previously {{shown to be}} positive in human diploid cell cultures. The 135 positive specimens selected were representative of 22 different rhinovirus types, and 4 to 9 specimens were available for each serotype. Specimens were inoculated into human diploid fetal tonsil fibroblasts (FT), HeLa cells with 30 mM Mg 2 +, and HeLa cells without increased Mg 2 +. One hundred twelve rhinovirus strains (83 %) were reisolated in FT cells, whereas 76 rhinovirus strains (56 %) were recovered in HeLa cells with 30 mM Mg 2 +. All strains recovered in FT were the same serotype as that originally recovered in diploid cells, but five of the HeLa cell isolates (3. 7 % of total specimens) were different serotypes, indicating dual rhinovirus infections. Four rhinovirus serotypes, (3, 42, 48, and 70) were recovered in HeLa but not in diploid cells; these serotypes were rare in our previous studies. Isolation of rhinovirus in FT cells was usually accomplished at first passage, whereas rhinovirus cytopathic effects in HeLa cells were not observed at first passage, but required one, two, or (rarely) three <b>blind</b> <b>passages.</b> Only 28 rhinoviruses (21 %) were recovered in HeLa cells without increased Mg 2 +; however, three serotypes, types 16, 36, and 58, were recovered as effectively in HeLa cells, with or without added Mg 2 +, {{as they were in}} FT cells. In general, rhinoviruses were less efficiently recovered in HeLa cells; however, certain serotypes may be detected better by HeLa cells...|$|R
