40|$|In this thesis, a {{thorough}} {{study of the}} batch top-spray fluidized bed granulation was carried out including experimental study, population balance model (PBM), computational fluid dynamic (CFD) study and control strategy development. For the experimental study, the influence variables of pulsed frequency, <b>binder</b> <b>spray</b> rate and atomization pressure of a batch top-spray fluidized bed granulation process were studied using the Box-Behnken experimental design method. Different mathematical models were developed to predict the mean size of granules, yield, relative width of granule distribution, Hausner ratio and final granule moisture content. Validation experiments have shown the reliability and effectiveness of using the Box-Behnken experimental design method to study a fluidized bed granulation process. The one-dimensional population balance models (ODPBMs) {{have been developed to}} model a pulsed top-spray fluidized bed granulation, linking the operating factors of the pulsed frequency, the <b>binder</b> <b>spray</b> rate, and atomization air pressure with the granule properties to predict granule growth behavior at different operating conditions. A multi-stage open optimal control strategy based on the developed ODPBMs was proposed to reduce the model and process mismatch through adjusting the trajectory of the evolution of the granule size distribution at predefined sample intervals. The effectiveness of the proposed modeling and multi-stage open optimal control strategy has been validated by experimental and simulation tests. In addition, an Eulerian-Eulerian two-fluid model (EETFM) was developed to describe the gas-particle two-phase flow in the fluidized bed granulator. By computational fluid dynamic analysis, it has been proven that the fluidized bed granulation system is not homogeneous, based on which a two-compartmental population balance model (TCPBM) was developed to describe the particle growth in the fluidized bed granulation.

The study has supported {{the theory that the}} granule size can be controlled through the liquid feed pulsing. However, care has to be taken when the pulsed frequency is chosen for controlling the granule size due to the nonlinear quadratic relation in the regression model. The design space of the ranges of operating parameters has been determined based on constraints of the mean size of granules and granule yield.

40|$|In this work, a {{nucleation}} {{model that}} includes nuclei breakage/fragmentation is proposed.

It is proposed that breakage or fragmentation of primary nuclei from <b>binder</b> <b>spray</b> will occur if the Stokes deformation number exceeds a certain critical number. In the case where breakage occurs the model for secondary nuclei size distribution is proposed. To validate the model, the characteristics of the primary nuclei formed from nickel laterite ores with diluted sulphuric solutions as a binder were investigated. The nuclei were produced by dropping the binder solution onto a stationary powder bed. The mechanical integrity of the primary nuclei formed, the relationship between the nuclei diameter and binder drop diameter were studied.

40|$|This {{study has}} {{considered}} the optimisation of granola breakfast cereal manufacturing processes by wet granulation and pneumatic conveying. Granola is an aggregated food product {{used as a}} breakfast cereal and in cereal bars. Processing of granola involves mixing the dry ingredients (typically oats, nuts, etc.) followed {{by the addition of}} a binder which can contain honey, water and/or oil. In this work, the design and operation of two parallel wet granulation processes to produce aggregate granola products were incorporated: a) a high shear mixing granulation process followed by drying/toasting in an oven. b) a continuous fluidised bed followed by drying/toasting in an oven. In high shear granulation the influence of process parameters on key granule aggregate quality attributes such as granule size distribution and textural properties of granola were investigated. The experimental results show that the impeller rotational speed {{is the single most important}} process parameter which influences granola physical and textural properties. After that binder addition rate and wet massing time also show significant impacts on granule properties. Increasing the impeller speed and wet massing time increases the median granule size while also presenting a positive correlation with density. The combination of high impeller speed and low binder addition rate resulted in granules with the highest levels of hardness and crispness. In the fluidised bed granulation process the effect of nozzle air pressure and <b>binder</b> <b>spray</b> rate on key aggregate quality attributes were studied. The experimental results show that a decrease in nozzle air pressure leads to larger in mean granule size. The combination of lowest nozzle air pressure and lowest <b>binder</b> <b>spray</b> rate results in granules with the highest levels of hardness and crispness. Overall, the high shear granulation process led to larger, denser, less porous and stronger (less likely to break) aggregates than the fluidised bed process. The study also examined the particle breakage of granola during pneumatic conveying produced by both the high shear granulation and the fluidised bed granulation process. Products were pneumatically conveyed in a purpose built conveying rig designed to mimic product conveying and packaging. Three different conveying rig configurations were employed; a straight pipe, a rig consisting two 45 ° bends and one with 90 ° bend. Particle breakage increases with applied pressure drop, and a 90 ° bend pipe results in more attrition for all conveying velocities relative to other pipe geometry. Additionally for the granules produced in the high shear granulator; those produced at the highest impeller speed, while being the largest also have the lowest levels of proportional breakage while smaller granules produced at the lowest impeller speed have the highest levels of breakage. This effect clearly shows the importance of shear history (during granule production) on breakage during subsequent processing. In terms of the fluidised bed granulation, there was no single operating parameter that was deemed to have a significant effect on breakage during subsequent conveying. Finally, a simple power law breakage model based on process input parameters was developed for both manufacturing processes. It was found suitable for predicting the breakage of granola breakfast cereal at various applied air velocities using a number of pipe configurations, taking into account shear histories...|$|E

40|$|Nucleation is {{the first}} stage in any {{granulation}} process where binder liquid first comes {{into contact with the}} powder. This paper investigates the nucleation process where binder liquid is added to a fine powder with a spray nozzle. The dimensionless spray flux approach of Hapgood et al. (Powder Technol. 141 (2004) 20) is extended to account for nonuniform spray patterns and allow for overlap of nuclei granules rather than spray drops. A dimensionless nuclei distribution function which describes the effects of the design and operating parameters of the nucleation process (<b>binder</b> <b>spray</b> characteristics, the nucleation area ratio between droplets and nuclei and the powder bed velocity) on the fractional surface area coverage of nuclei on a moving powder bed is developed. From this starting point, a Monte Carlo nucleation model that simulates full nuclei size distributions {{as a function of the}} design and operating parameters that were implemented in the dimensionless nuclei distribution function is developed. The nucleation model was then used to investigate the effects of the design and operating parameters on the formed nuclei size distributions and to correlate these effects to changes of the dimensionless nuclei distribution function. Model simulations also showed that it is possible to predict nuclei size distributions beyond the drop controlled nucleation regime in Hapgood 2 ̆ 7 s nucleation regime map. Qualitative comparison of model simulations and experimental nucleation data showed similar shapes of the nuclei size distributions. In its current form, the nucleation model can replace the nucleation term in one-dimensional population balance models describing wet granulation processes. Implementation of more sophisticated nucleation kinetics can make the model applicable to multi-dimensional population balance models...|$|E
40|$|Process {{optimisation}} and {{optimal control}} of batch and continuous drum granulation processes are studied in this paper. The {{main focus of}} the current research has been: (i) construction of optimisation and control relevant, population balance models through the incorporation of moisture content, drum rotation rate and bed depth into the coalescence kernels; (ii) investigation of optimal operational conditions using constrained optimisation techniques; (iii) development of optimal control algorithms based on discretized population balance equations; and (iv) comprehensive simulation studies on optimal control of both batch and continuous granulation processes. The objective of steady state optimisation is to minimise the recycle rate with minimum cost for continuous processes. It has been identified that the drum rotation-rate, bed depth (material charge), and moisture content of solids are practical decision (design) parameters for system optimisation. The objective for the optimal control of batch granulation processes is to maximize the mass of product-sized particles with minimum time and binder consumption. The objective for the optimal control of the continuous process is to drive the process from one steady state to another in a minimum time with minimum binder consumption, which {{is also known as}} the state-driving problem. It has been known for some time that the binder spray-rate is the most effective control (manipulative) variable. Although other possible manipulative variables, such as feed flow-rate and additional powder flow-rate have been investigated in the complete research project, only the single input problem with the <b>binder</b> <b>spray</b> rate as the manipulative variable is addressed in the paper to demonstrate the methodology. It can be shown from simulation results that the proposed models are suitable for control and optimisation studies, and the optimisation algorithms connected with either steady state or dynamic models are successful for the determination of optimal operational conditions and dynamic trajectories with good convergence properties.

40|$|Spray {{granulation}} {{is commonly}} used to improve the flow of drug formulation powders by adding liquid binders. We have discovered a new granulation process whereby liquid binders are added as aqueous foam.

40|$|The novel {{technique}} of <b>spraying</b> <b>binder</b> liquid in pulses of short duration on a bubbling fluidized bed {{was used to}} study the effect liquid distribution, mixing, and relative humidity has on granule growth. Two important mixing zones in the fluid-bed granulation process are identified. First, the wetting zone, where the spraying rate relative to the surface renewal rate determines the wetting of the granules and powder. The sur;face renewal has to be sufficient to prevent overwetting of the surface, which would result in defluidization of the bed. Second, the bulk zone, where the turnover rate of granules relative to the drying rate may determine the secondary growth rate of granules.

40|$|Fluidized bed {{agglomeration}} is used {{to produce}} large and porous dry agglomerates with improved instant properties. Water (or <b>binder</b> solution) is <b>sprayed</b> in the fluidized bed of particles to render their surface sticky. The agglomerate growth results from the repetition of different steps (wetting of the particle surface, particles collision and bridging, and drying) and depends on the processing conditions and product properties. In this work, skim and whole milk powders were fluidized in hot air and agglomerated by spraying water in a bench-scale batch fluidized bed. The aim was to study {{the impact of the}} sprayed water flow rate (0 - 5. 5 g. min(- 1)), particle load (300 - 400 g), initial particle size (200 - 350 mu m), and composition (skim-whole milk) on the growth mechanisms and on the properties of the agglomerates obtained. Powder samples were regularly taken in the fluidized bed during agglomeration and characterized for the size, size distribution, and water content. Whatever the conditions tested, the size increase and the evolution of the particle size distribution during agglomeration were found to mainly depend on the relative amount of water sprayed in the particle bed. Agglomeration occurred in two stages, with first the rapid association of initial particles into intermediate structures, and second, the progressive growth of porous agglomerates.

40|$|The {{nature and}} {{kinetics}} of electrode reactions and processes occurring for four lightweight anode systems {{which have been}} utilised in reinforced concrete cathodic protection systems have been studied. The anodes investigated were flame sprayed zinc, conductive paint and two activated titanium meshes. The electrochemical properties of each material were investigated in rapidly stirred de-oxygenated electrolytes using anodic potentiodynamic polarisation. Conductive coating electrodes were formed on glass microscope slides, whilst mesh strands were immersed directly. Oxygen evolution occurred preferentially for both mesh anodes in saturated Ca (OH) 2 /CaC 12 solutions but was severely inhibited in less alkaline solutions and significant current only passed in chloride solutions. The main reactions for conductive paint was based on oxygen evolution in all electrolytes, although chlorides increased the electrical activity. Self-corrosion of zinc was controlled by electrolyte composition and the experimental set-up, chlorides increasing the electrical activity. Impressed current cathodic protection was applied to 25 externally exposed concrete slabs {{over a period of}} 18 months to investigate anode degradation mechanisms at normal and high current densities. Specimen chloride content, curing and reinforcement depth were also variables. Several destructive and non-destructive methods for assessing the performance of anodes were evaluated including a site instrument for quantitative "instant-off- potential measurements. The impact of cathodic protection on the concrete substrate was determined for a number of specimens using appropriate methods. Anodic degradation rates were primarily influenced by current density, followed by cemendtious alkalinity, chloride levels and by current distribution. Degradation of cementitious overlays and conductive paint substrates proceeded by sequential neutralisation of cement phases, with some evidence of paint <b>binder</b> oxidation. <b>Sprayed</b> zinc progressively formed an insulating layer of hydroxide complexes, which underwent pitting_ attack in the presence of sufficient chlorides, whilst substrate degradation was minimal. Adhesion of all anode systems decreased with increasing current density. The influence of anode material on the ionic gradients which can develop during cathodic protection was investigated. A constant current was passed through saturated cement paste prisms containing calcium chloride to central cathodes via anodes applied or embedded at each end. Pore solution was obtained from successive cut paste slices for anion and cation analyses. Various experimental errors reduced the value of the results. Characteristic S-shaped profiles were not observed and chloride ion profiles were ambiguous. Mesh anode specimens were significantly more durable than the conductive coatings in the high humidity environment. Limited results suggested zinc ion migration to the cathode region.

The supports normally used in literature are ceramics, {{but they are not}} suitable for industrial applications. Stainless steel and aluminium are much more common in full-scale reactors and were therefore chosen in this investigation. Chemical etching, anodisation, electrochemical DC etching and AC etching treatment methods were used to modify the surface morphology of aluminium and stainless steel plates in order to improve the mechanical stability of photocatalyst (TiO 2) coating. Two-part epoxysiloxane hybrid (ESH) and sodium silicate adhesives have been evaluated for use as TiO 2 <b>binder.</b> Dip and <b>spray</b> coating techniques were employed for preparing TiO 2 coatings on blank plates, pretreated plates, ESH and sodium silicate coated plates. Stainless steel electrochemically etched in dilute aqua regia gave the most mechanically stable coating.

Additionally, photocatalytic performance of the coating was higher than that coated on ceramic support. The mechanical stability of TiO 2 coated on ESH and sodium silicate using dip and spray coating techniques was exceedingly improved. However, Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy (EDS) analysis showed that TiO 2 was embedded in the adhesives. Nevertheless, sprinkling of TiO 2 powder on sodium silicate presented a very stable coating regardless of high TiO 2 loading.

Both the produced coatings and feedstock powder are characterized by optical microscopy, Xray diffractometry (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) including energy dispersive X-ray analyses (EDXS). The volumetric content of the carbide phase is 73 vol. -%, that corresponds to 67 wt. -% of SiC and 76 wt. -% of TiC within the composite powders. The carbide grain size is 2. 5 microns and 1. 5 microns respectively. The oxide-ceramic matrix phase mainly contains yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Y 3 Al 5 O 12) and a smaller amount of corundum (Al 2 O 3). The powder particles show globular shapes. All components are homogeneously distributed within the powder microstructures. While APS coatings show high porosities in the lower coating areas so far, all produced HVOF coatings show higher densities and continuously developed coatings-substrate interfaces.

"December 2012 "A combined dilatometer mass spectrometer system (CDMS) is used to monitor the gas phase species and sintering progress in real time during the heating of barium titanate and ultra high temperature ceramics (UHTCs), including zirconium diboride and sintering additives. For loose powder and pressed samples of barium titanate heated at different rates, two families of signals were observed by mass spectrometry at mass to charge (m/z) ratios of 44 and 64 prior to the onset of sintering at 1150 °C, and were assigned as carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. The sources for carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide evolution include organic impurities arising from processing, exposure to ambient organic material, adsorbed carbon dioxide and residual unreacted or surface barium carbonate and barium sulfate.

40|$|The Fischer-Tropsch (F-T) {{reaction}} {{provides a}} way of converting coal-derived synthesis gas (CO+ H{sub 2 }) to liquid fuels. Since the reaction is highly exothermic, {{one of the major}} problems in control of the reaction is heat removal. Recent work has shown that the use of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) can largely solve this problem. The use of iron-(FE) based catalysts is attractive not only due to their low cost and ready availability, but also due to their high water-gas shift activity which makes it possible to use these catalysts with low H{sub 2 }/CO ratios. However, a serious problem with the use of Fe catalysts in a SBCR is their tendency to undergo attrition. This can cause fouling/plugging of downstream filters and equipment; makes the separation of catalyst from the oil/wax product very difficult, if not impossible; and results in a steady loss of catalyst from the reactor. Under a previous Department of Energy (DOE) /University Research Grant (UCR) grant, Hampton University reported, for the first time, the development of demonstrably attrition-resistant Fe F-T synthesis catalysts having good activity, selectivity, and attrition resistance. These catalysts were prepared by spray drying Fe catalysts with potassium (K), copper (Cu), and silica (SiO{sub 2 }) as promoters. SiO{sub 2 } was also used as a <b>binder</b> for <b>spray</b> drying. These catalysts were tested for activity and selectivity in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor. Fundamental understanding of attrition is being addressed by incorporating suitable binders into the catalyst recipe. This has resulted in the preparation of a spray dried HPR- 43 catalyst having average particle size (aps) of 70 {micro}m with high attrition resistance. This HPR- 43 attrition resistant, active and selective catalyst gave 95 % CO conversion through 125 hours of testing in a fixed-bed at 270 C, 1. 48 MPa, H{sub 2 }/CO= 0. 67 and 2. 0 NL/g-cat/h with C{sub 5 +} selectivity of > 78 % and methane selectivity of less than 5 % at an {alpha} of 0. 9. Research is proposed to enable further development and optimization of these catalysts by (1) better understanding the role and interrelationship of various catalyst composition and preparation parameters on attrition resistance, activity, and selectivity of these catalysts, (2) the presence of sulfide ions on a precipitated iron catalyst, and (3) the effect of water on sulfided iron F-T catalysts for its activity, selectivity, and attrition. Catalyst preparations will be based on spray drying. The research employed, among other measurements, attrition testing and F-T synthesis at high pressure. Catalyst activity and selectivity is evaluated using a small fixed-bed reactor and a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation, followed by <b>binder</b> addition and <b>spray</b> drying at 250 C in a 1 -m-diameter, 2 -m-tall <b>spray</b> dryer. The <b>binder</b> silica content was varied from 0 to 20 wt%. The results show that the use of small amounts of precipitated SiO{sub 2 } alone in spray-dried Fe catalysts can result in good attrition resistance. All catalysts investigated with SiO 2 wt% {le} 12 produced fines less than 10 wt% during the jet cup attrition test, making them suitable for long-term use in a slurry bubble column reactor. Thus, concentration rather than the type of SiO{sub 2 } incorporated into catalyst has a more critical impact on catalyst attrition resistance of spray-dried Fe catalysts. Lower amounts of SiO{sub 2 } added to a catalyst give higher particle densities and therefore higher attrition resistances. In order to produce a suitable SBCR catalyst, however, the amount of SiO{sub 2 } added has to be optimized to provide adequate surface area, particle density, and attrition resistance. Two of the catalysts with precipitated and binder silica were tested in Texas A&M University's CSTR (Autoclave Engineers). The two catalysts were also tested at The Center for Applied Energy Research in Lexington, Kentucky of the University of Kentucky. Spray-dried catalysts with compositions 100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K/ 11 (P) SiO{sub 2 } and 100 Fe/ 5 Cu/ 4. 2 K/ 1. 1 (B) SiO{sub 2 } have excellent selectivity characteristics (low methane and high C{sub 5 +} yields), but their productivity and stability (deactivation rate) need to be improved. Mechanical integrity (attrition strength) of these two catalysts was markedly dependent upon their morphological features. The attrition strength of the catalyst made out of largely spherical particles (1. 1 (B) SiO{sub 2 }) was considerably higher than that of the catalyst consisting of irregularly shaped particles (11 (P) SiO{sub 2 }) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} characteristic test of broiler ration pelleted that added of onggok as <b>binder</b> with water <b>spraying</b> process ABSTRACT. Pellet {{is a kind}} of solidified and mechanically compressed feed. Problem frequently rise is that pellet shape is easily damaged, brittle, and broken during production, transportation and storage processing. The purpose this study was to know the influence of onggok addition as binding agent with 5 % water spraying on the {{physical characteristic}} of pellet form ration. The data were analyzed by analyzed of variance and the significant experiment results would be examined by orthogonal contrast test. The treatments consist from the first experiment were: A 1 = basal ration + 0 % spraying water, A 2 = basal ration + 5 % spraying water, A 3 = basal ration + 10 % spraying water and A 4 = basal ration + 15 % spraying water. The best result from the first experiment would be used for the second experiment, the treatments second experiment were: R 1 = basal ration + 5 % spraying water + 0 % onggok, R 2 = basal ration + 5 % spraying water + 2 % onggok, R 3 = basal ration + 5 % spraying water + 4 % onggok and R 4 = basal ration + 5 % spraying water + 6 % onggok. The parameters were water content, water activity, specific gravity, loose bulk density, compressed bulk density, angle of repose, modulus of fineness, average particle sizes and the durability of pellet form. The conclusion of the experiment that added of onggok as binder significant influenced of the characteristic physical pellet, i. e. : increased loose bulk density, compressed bulk density, modulus of fineness, average particle sizes, and durability of pellet, but decreased specific gravity, water content, angle of repose and water activity...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is driven by two main {{challenges}} in the antenna and propagation community: The possibility to manufacture exact replicas of spatially variable dielectric substrates for low frequency Radiofrequency (RF) applications and to achieve performance enhancements via formal optimization techniques for high frequency applications such as nano-antennas. In the RF and optics community, metamaterials have gained significant interest due to their extraordinary properties which are not accessible in nature. Textured composites with novel properties allow for the realization of state-of-the-art devices which are functionalized through spatially variable properties of dielectrics, magnetics and polymers. The possibility of spatially controlling permittivity and permeability at the preferred frequency and the capability of realizing multi-material volumetric variations is an ancient vision in the RF community. One such technique has been proposed and adopted to produce spatially variable ceramic substrates of small size (2 " square) and assembled to construct a UHF SATCOM antenna substrate. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the objective is to use earlier proposed Dry Powder Deposition (DPD) technique for producing large monolithic substrates with spatial variation of ceramic constituents that will allow for impressive performance enhancements as dictated by design results. Commercially available LTCC powders namely Calcium Magnesium Titanates (MCT) of dielectric permittivities 15, 20, 70 and loss tangent < 0. 0015 are used as the ceramic constituents. Thermogravimetric analysis of each constituent powder is used to analyze efficient removal of 1 - 3 % <b>binder</b> content of <b>spray</b> dried MCT powders and achieve complete sintering of their textured composites. Also, a detailed analysis of the process parameters such as compaction pressure and cosintering temperature within the DPD method is carried out. As a result, smooth and large substrates with sizes up to 82 mm x 82 mm of monolithic dielectric textured composites were obtained by cosintering at optimal conditions. Cracks and unwanted defects such as porosities in textured composites were eliminated. Density measurements and SEM stressed that final substrates obtained were over % 98 dense ceramic constituents. Microstructure characterizations of pellets made of sintered constituent material were carried out by SEM and dielectric permittivity measurements were performed. In the second part of the thesis, the objective is to develop a basic framework to optimize a nano antenna's intensity enhancement and absorbed power according to variables such as length, thickness, width and wavelength using gradient and heuristic based methods (sequential quadratic programming and genetic algorithms). This framework will allow for more effective assessment of high-frequency antenna applications subject to multiple competing performance criteria and complex design variables in the future including the effect of material substrates, hence enable novel designs with superior performance for emerging plasmonic applications as was the case for the SATCOM antenna design in {{the first part of the}} thesis...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} an {{extensive}} background {{study on the}} use of bio-oil modified binder, used in surface dressings in Iceland, was carried out. Surface dressings, or chip seals, are paved by first <b>spraying</b> out <b>binder</b> and then distributing aggregates over the surface before compaction. The bio-oil, most notably fish oil ethyl ester or rape seed oil, is included in a binder mixture to lower its viscosity, enabling the <b>binder</b> to be <b>sprayed</b> out at a lower temperature than unmodified bitumen. In January 2013, severe bleeding of binder was noticed on road sections paved with bio-oil modified surface dressings {{in the northern part of}} Iceland. Following the bleeding, the Icelandic Road and Coastal Administration (IRCA) sent samples of the sections in question, as well as binder samples, for testing at the laboratory of Highway and Railway Engineering at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (KTH) in Stockholm, Sweden. The conclusions of that study were that the fish oil ethyl ester was highly polar and had solubility issues with the bitumen. This was found to have led to the fish oil separating from the binder mixture and covering the stones, preventing bonding between aggregates and binder [1]. The laboratory tests in this thesis extend on the aforementioned research. Through the background investigation it was found thatWetfix N, an adhesion promoter, was used in the binder mixture to facilitate bonding to the aggregates. Based on these findings, previous work and field experience in Iceland, two sample sets were created. The first sample set included 7. 5 % of either fish oil ethyl ester or rape seed oil by weight, while the second set included 4 % of the same bio-oils by weight. To determine the effect of the adhesion promoter, all samples were tested with and without Wetfix N. Furthermore, all samples were put through a short-term aging treatment to simulate the process during mixing and paving, and tested again. The findings of this study suggest that the fish oil ethyl ester is more suitable for road constructions, compared to the rape seed oil, and that adhesion promoter should always be included when paving surface dressings in Iceland. Furthermore, the samples tested cannot be recommended for field use due to high polarity in the sample with a fish oil concentration of 7. 5 % and too high viscosity in the sample which includes 4 % of fish oil. Therefore, it can be said that the upper and lower limits have been narrowed to the range between the two concentrations tested. To better understand the properties and behavior of the sample mixtures, a complete adhesion test with aggregates is advisable. Viscosity testing of samples which include between 4. 5 % and 7 % of fish oil by weight are recommended and the mixture with the lowest concentration that passes IRCA’s guidelines for spraying viscosity at a desired temperature should be used in practice...|$|R
40|$|Fischer-Tropsch (FT) {{synthesis}} {{to convert}} syngas (CO + H{sub 2 }) derived from natural gas or coal to liquid fuels and wax is a well-established technology. For low H{sub 2 } to CO ratio syngas produced from CO{sub 2 } reforming {{of natural gas}} or from gasification of coal, the use of Fe catalysts is attractive because of their high water gas shift activity {{in addition to their}} high FT activity. Fe catalysts are also attractive due to their low cost and low methane selectivity. Because of the highly exothermic nature of the FT reaction, there has been a recent move away from fixed-bed reactors toward the development of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) that employ 30 to 90 {micro}m catalyst particles suspended in a waxy liquid for efficient heat removal. However, the use of Fe FT catalysts in an SBCR has been problematic due to severe catalyst attrition resulting in fines that plug the filter employed to separate the catalyst from the waxy product. Fe catalysts can undergo attrition in SBCRs not only due to vigorous movement and collisions but also due to phase changes that occur during activation and reaction. The objectives of this research were to develop {{a better understanding of the}} parameters affecting attrition of Fe F-T catalysts suitable for use in SBCRs and to incorporate this understanding into the design of novel Fe catalysts having superior attrition resistance. The catalysts were prepared by co-precipitation, followed by <b>binder</b> addition and <b>spray</b> drying at 250 C in a 1 m diameter, 2 m tall <b>spray</b> dryer.
