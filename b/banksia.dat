5|$|Under George's taxonomic {{arrangement}} of <b>Banksia,</b> B.serrata {{is placed in}} the Genus <b>Banksia,</b> Subgenus <b>Banksia,</b> Section <b>Banksia</b> and Series <b>Banksia</b> along with B.aemula, B.ornata, B.baxteri, B.speciosa, B.menziesii, B.candolleana and B.sceptrum.|$|E
5|$|A major {{disruption}} to <b>Banksia</b> nomenclature {{occurred in}} 1891, when Otto Kuntze challenged <b>Banksia</b> L.f. {{on the grounds}} that Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg had already penned the name <b>Banksia</b> to describe a different genus of plant, and hence <b>Banksia</b> J.R.Forst & G. Forst took precedence and rendered <b>Banksia</b> L.f. (i.e. as used by Linnaeus) invalid. Kuntze transferred all <b>Banksia</b> taxa to the new name Sirmuellera; thus B.dentata became Sirmuellera dentata (L.f.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge failed, as did a similar challenge by James Britten in 1905. Britten proposed the generic name Isostylis, republishing B.dentata as Isostylis dentata (L.f.) Britten. In 1940 <b>Banksia</b> L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges.|$|E
5|$|Alex George {{described}} {{the plant in}} his 1981 monograph of the genus <b>Banksia</b> as a variety of <b>Banksia</b> integrifolia, but later reclassified it as a separate species. Genetic studies show it {{to be related to}} <b>Banksia</b> plagiocarpa, <b>Banksia</b> oblongifolia and <b>Banksia</b> robur. The species is found in wet sclerophyll forest and rainforest margins on sandy soils. <b>Banksia</b> aquilonia regenerates after bushfire by regrowing from epicormic buds under its bark. It is rarely cultivated.|$|E
50|$|Rosa <b>banksiae</b> has likely been {{grown in}} the gardens of China for {{hundreds}} of years. The species was introduced to Europe by William Kerr, who had been sent on a plant-hunting expedition by Sir Joseph Banks. He bought the first Lady Banks' Rose, subsequently named the white Lady Banks (R. <b>banksiae</b> var. <b>banksiae)</b> from the famous Fa Tee nursery in 1807. A number of other forms were subsequently discovered growing in China, including R. <b>banksiae</b> var. normalis (see above), and R. <b>banksiae</b> 'Lutea', the yellow Lady Banks' rose (brought to Europe in 1824 by J. D. Parks). In 1993 this cultivar earned the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|R

5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of <b>Banksia</b> in his 1981 monograph The genus <b>Banksia</b> L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subg. <b>Banksia,</b> and {{was divided into}} three sections. B.serrata was placed in B.sect. <b>Banksia,</b> and this was further divided into nine series, placing B.serrata in B.ser. <b>Banksia</b> (formerly Orthostylis).|$|E
5|$|<b>Banksia</b> ericifolia has {{traditionally}} been described as lying within series Spicigerae of <b>Banksia,</b> together with <b>Banksia</b> spinulosa and various western Hairpin-like Banksias such as B.seminuda and B.brownii. This series is placed in <b>Banksia</b> sect. Oncostylis according to Alex George's taxonomy of <b>Banksia,</b> but directly into <b>Banksia</b> subg. <b>Banksia</b> in Thiele's arrangement based on cladistic analysis. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries Ericifoliae, {{but this was not}} supported by George.|$|E
5|$|<b>Banksia</b> ilicifolia grows {{exclusively}} on sandy soils; its range ends where heavy soils are evident. It especially favours low-lying areas. It generally grows in open woodland alongside such trees as jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata), candlestick <b>banksia</b> (<b>Banksia</b> attenuata), firewood <b>banksia</b> (B. menziesii) and Western Australian Christmas tree (Nuytsia floribunda). Along the south coast, it grows in heath, sometimes forming stands with bull <b>banksia</b> (B. grandis).|$|E
50|$|Each {{volume of}} The <b>Banksias</b> has been {{presented}} to the Queen by the Australian Government as a gift of the Australian people. Largely {{on the basis of}} her work for The <b>Banksias,</b> Rosser was awarded a Medal of the Order of Australia 1995 for her contribution to botanical art, and the Jill Smythies Award for botanical art in 1997.|$|R

5|$|<b>Banksia</b> serrata {{was first}} {{collected}} at Botany Bay on 29 April 1770, by Sir Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander, naturalists on the British vessel HMS Endeavour during Lieutenant (later Captain) James Cook's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The species was not published until April 1782, when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described {{the first four}} <b>Banksia</b> species in his Supplementum Plantarum, commenting {{that it was the}} showiest species in the genus. As the first named species of the genus, <b>Banksia</b> serrata is considered the type species. <b>Banksia</b> serrata has the common names of old man <b>banksia,</b> saw <b>banksia,</b> saw-toothed <b>banksia</b> and saw-leaved <b>banksia.</b> It is also known as red honeysuckle and red <b>banksia</b> from the colour of its timber.|$|E
5|$|George Bentham {{published}} a thorough revision of <b>Banksia</b> in his landmark publication Flora Australiensis in 1870. In Bentham's arrangement, {{the number of}} recognised <b>Banksia</b> species was reduced from 60 to 46. Bentham defined four sections based on leaf, style and pollen-presenter characters. <b>Banksia</b> caleyi was placed in section Orthostylis. In his 1891 work Revisio Generum Plantarum, German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name <b>Banksia</b> L.f., {{on the grounds that}} the name <b>Banksia</b> had previously been published in 1775 as <b>Banksia</b> J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.caleyi as Sirmuellera caleyi. The challenge failed, and <b>Banksia</b> L.f. was formally conserved in 1940.|$|E
5|$|George placed B.telmatiaea in {{subgenus}} <b>Banksia</b> {{because its}} inflorescence {{is a typical}} <b>Banksia</b> flower spike, section Oncostylis because it has hooked styles, and series Abietinae because its inflorescence is roughly spherical. He considered its closest relative to be B.leptophylla (Slender-leaved <b>Banksia),</b> which differs from B.telmatiaea in having longer leaves and larger flowers; yet in his arrangement he placed it between B.scabrella (Burma Road <b>Banksia)</b> and B.laricina (Rose-fruited <b>Banksia).</b>|$|E

50|$|Among the <b>banksias,</b> many {{of which}} grow in {{temperate}} and Mediterranean climates, the vast majority are shrubs; only a few are trees that are valued for their height. Among the tallest species are: B. integrifolia with its subspecies B. integrifolia subsp. monticola, which is noteworthy as the plants that form the subspecies are the tallest trees of the <b>banksias</b> {{and they are the}} more frost-resistant than other <b>banksias,</b> B. seminuda, B. littoralis, B. serrata; among those that can be considered small trees or large shrubs: B. grandis, B. prionotes, B. marginata, B. coccinea and B. speciosa; all of these are planted in parks and gardens and even along roadsides because of their size. The rest of the species of this genus, around 170 species, are shrubs, although some of them are valued for their flowers.|$|R
5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze {{challenged the}} generic name <b>Banksia</b> L.f., {{on the grounds}} that the name <b>Banksia</b> had previously been published in 1775 as <b>Banksia</b> J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea. Kuntze proposed Sirmuellera as an alternative, republishing B.aemula as Sirmuellera serratifolia. The challenge failed, and <b>Banksia</b> L.f. was formally conserved.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, a {{molecular}} study by Austin Mast again {{showed that the}} three eastern species formed a natural group, or clade, but they were only distantly related to {{other members of the}} series <b>Banksia.</b> Instead, they formed a sister group to a large group comprising the series Prostratae, Ochraceae, Tetragonae (including <b>Banksia</b> elderiana), <b>Banksia</b> lullfitzii and <b>Banksia</b> baueri.|$|E
5|$|Otto Kuntze {{challenged}} <b>Banksia</b> L.f. on {{the grounds}} that <b>Banksia</b> J.R.Forst & G. Forst had been published before it, and transferred all <b>Banksia</b> taxa to the new name Sirmuellera. Thus, B.ilicifolia became Sirmuellera ilicifolia (R.Br.) Kuntze. Kuntze's challenge did not gain wide acceptance, and <b>Banksia</b> L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges in 1940.|$|E

5|$|The {{common name}} of {{firewood}} <b>banksia</b> {{was a result}} of its quick-burning properties. Other names recorded include Menzies <b>banksia,</b> firewheel <b>banksia,</b> port wine <b>banksia,</b> flame <b>banksia,</b> and in the cut flower industry, strawberry <b>banksia</b> and raspberry frost <b>banksia.</b> The Beeloo Whadjuk Noongar people of the Perth region knew it as the Mungyt. Despite its variation across its range, George noted that B.menziesii was a clearly defined species, and no formal division into subspecies was warranted.|$|E
5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the <b>Banksia</b> genus is based on George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.integrifolia is placed in <b>Banksia</b> subg. <b>Banksia,</b> because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes; <b>Banksia</b> sect. <b>Banksia</b> because of its straight styles; and <b>Banksia</b> ser. Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele additionally placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae, but this was not supported by George.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} reported common names of B.prionotes are acorn <b>banksia,</b> {{derived from the}} resemblance of partly opened inflorescences to acorns; and orange <b>banksia.</b> Other reported common names include saw-toothed <b>banksia</b> and golden <b>banksia</b> Bwongka is a generic Noongar name for <b>Banksia</b> in the Avon River catchment, where B. prionotes {{is one of several}} species occurring.|$|E
25|$|<b>Banksias</b> {{possibly}} {{require more}} maintenance than other Australian natives, though are fairly hardy {{if the right}} conditions are provided (sunny aspect and well drained sandy soil).|$|R
25|$|Because dieback {{thrives in}} moist soil conditions, {{it can be}} a severe problem for <b>Banksias</b> that are watered, such as in the cut flower {{industry}} and urban gardens.|$|R
50|$|In a later publication, George would {{refer to}} this series by the name B. ser. <b>Banksiae,</b> but this is {{probably}} a typographical error, as the name has not been validly published.|$|R
5|$|Alex George {{published}} a new taxonomic arrangement of <b>Banksia</b> {{in his classic}} 1981 monograph The genus <b>Banksia</b> L.f. (Proteaceae). Endlicher's Eubanksia became B.subgenus <b>Banksia,</b> and was divided into three sections. George placed <b>Banksia</b> coccinea in its own series—Banksia series Coccineae—within the section B.section <b>Banksia</b> on account of a unique combination of characters, namely the vertical arrangement of flowers on the spike, combined with the branched open habit, broad leaves and very small follicles. Members of the series Quercinae and five species within the series Spicigerae share the vertically aligned flowers, but do not wholly exhibit the other characters.|$|E
