5|$|The Kerrytown Shops, Main Street Business District, the State Street Business District, and the South University Business District are {{commercial}} {{areas in}} downtown Ann Arbor. Three commercial areas south of downtown include the areas near I-94 and Ann Arbor-Saline Road, <b>Briarwood</b> Mall, and the South Industrial area. Other commercial areas include the Arborland/Washtenaw Avenue and Packard Road merchants {{on the east}} side, the Plymouth Road area in the northeast, and the Westgate/West Stadium areas on the west side. Downtown contains a mix of 19th- and early-20th-century structures and modern-style buildings, {{as well as a}} farmers' market in the Kerrytown district. The city's commercial districts are composed mostly of two- to four-story structures, although downtown and the area near <b>Briarwood</b> Mall contain a small number of high-rise buildings.|$|E
5|$|Several {{stations}} {{along the}} line also have provisions for other extensions {{as part of the}} IND Second System. The Roosevelt Avenue station has an additional upper level platform and bellmouth provisions east of the station, which would have gone to a Queens crosstown line to the Rockaways. The 63rd Drive station has similar bellmouths, which would have fed directly into the inactive portion of the Long Island Rail Road's former Rockaway Beach Branch near its former junction with the LIRR Main Line (Whitepot Junction). One stop west, the Woodhaven Boulevard station has provisions to be converted into an express station. East of the <b>Briarwood</b> station, there were additional trackways built for an extension down Van Wyck Boulevard (today the Van Wyck Expressway) to Rockaway Boulevard, near the current site of John F. Kennedy International Airport. None of these proposals were ever funded, and only the <b>Briarwood</b> bellmouths were used for future expansion, while the Rockaway line was connected instead to the IND Fulton Street Line.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Boulevard line {{is served}} by four {{overlapping}} routes. The E train serves the section between 50th Street and <b>Briarwood,</b> normally running express west of 71st Avenue. The F runs express from 36th Street to 71st Avenue and local east of 71st Avenue. The M and R serve local stops on the route west of 71st Avenue, with the M diverging from the line west of Fifth Avenue/53rd Street and the R splitting west of Queens Plaza. The E and F serve the line at all times, while the M runs on the line during weekdays only and the R runs on the line at all times except late nights. During late nights, the E makes local stops west of <b>Briarwood</b> to provide local service along the line. The routes experience frequent overcrowding during weekdays, and the Queens Boulevard line has among the highest rush-hour train frequencies in the system. A proposed upgrade to the line, to replace its signals with a communications-based train control system, would add capacity to the line.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} several golf {{courses in the}} city, {{including}} the aforementioned Lakeview Municipal Golf Course, an 18-hole course {{open to the public}} daily. <b>Briarwood</b> County Club, located on Highway 39 North, is a private club with golf, swimming, fishing, and dining facilities. Other golf courses serving the city include Northwood Country Club, Okatibbee Creek Golf Center, and Ponta Creek Golf Course.|$|E
5|$|East of {{the station}} there is a flying {{junction}} that connects to the Jamaica Yard via a wye that curves east from the yard towards <b>Briarwood.</b> A second side of the wye curves west to become {{a lower level of}} the subway just west {{of the station}}. The yard itself is situated just north of the station in the southern portion of Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, between the Grand Central Parkway and the Van Wyck Expressway.|$|E
5|$|Phase I's {{flagship}} project was the 63rd Street–Southeast Queens line, which would stretch {{from the existing}} 57th Street subway station in Midtown Manhattan to the existing Laurelton LIRR station in Springfield Gardens. The construction of this line was to be split up into three parts. The first part, Route 131–A, would run from Sixth and Seventh Avenues in Manhattan below 63rd Street and the East River to Northern Boulevard. The next part, Route 131–B, the Super–Express Bypass Line, would continue along the LIRR right-of-way to Forest Hills. And finally, Route 131–D, the Southeastern Queens Line, would build {{a branch of the}} Queens Boulevard Line at <b>Briarwood</b> through Downtown Jamaica to Springfield Gardens via the LIRR's Atlantic Branch, with a ramp to eliminate the Jamaica Avenue elevated structure in Downtown Jamaica.|$|E
5|$|The Queens Boulevard Line's eastern {{terminus}} is the four-track 179th Street station. The line continues westward then northwest as a four-track {{line with}} the local tracks {{to the outside of}} the express tracks. The Queens Boulevard Line merges with the IND Archer Avenue Line west of <b>Briarwood</b> and with Jamaica Yard spurs west of Forest Hills–71st Avenue. The express tracks and the local tracks diverge at 65th Street in Jackson Heights and merge again at 36th Street in Sunnyside. West of 36th Street, the IND 63rd Street Line splits off both pairs of tracks, entering Manhattan via the 63rd Street Tunnel. At Queens Plaza in Long Island City, the line narrows to two tracks, with the local tracks splitting into the 60th Street Tunnel Connection and the IND Crosstown Line. From there, the express tracks of the line provide crosstown service across Manhattan under 53rd Street before turning southwest at Eighth Avenue, ending at the 50th Street station. The two-track section west of Queens Plaza is also known as the IND 53rd Street Line.|$|E
5|$|The Southeast Queens {{portion of}} the line would split from the IND Queens Boulevard Line using {{pre-existing}} bellmouths at <b>Briarwood,</b> would go to Springfield Boulevard in southeastern Queens using the LIRR Atlantic Branch, with a transfer to the LIRR at Jamaica. This Southeast Queens extension, which would use the upper level of the planned bi-level Archer Avenue subway, {{was the most important}} of several proposed lines along LIRR branches; it was originally intended to extend to the Laurelton LIRR station. While the upper level of the Archer Avenue subway would serve Queens Boulevard trains to Southeast Queens, the lower level for the BMT, which was to be built as part of Phase 2 as Route 133, would extend under Archer Avenue to 188th Street in Hollis. Both lines were only built to Jamaica Center; a LIRR extension would have necessitated the construction of new stations or the conversion of existing facilities along the right-of-way, as well as added additional capacity on which to run trains.|$|E
5|$|The freeway runs {{north of}} the Chrysler Chelsea Proving Grounds in Chelsea next to the M-52 interchange. As I-94 {{continues}} easterly, it passes into {{the western edge of}} the Ann Arbor area. West of downtown, the M-14 freeway splits off to the northeast, and the Interstate turns to the south and southeast to curve around the south side of the city. The freeway passes between the <b>Briarwood</b> Mall and the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport. On the southeastern corner of Ann Arbor, I-94 intersects US23 and continues around the south side of Ypsilanti. South of that city, the freeway also carries US12 and crosses the Huron River {{north of the}} river's mouth at Ford Lake. I-94 jogs southeasterly around the south side of the Willow Run Airport complex, separating from US12 and entering Wayne County.|$|E
25|$|Adjacent neighborhoods include Forest Hills to the west, Hillcrest to the east, <b>Briarwood</b> to the south, and Queensboro Hill to the north.|$|E
25|$|A 2-track subway line, {{splitting}} {{from the}} IND Queens Boulevard Line at <b>Briarwood,</b> to Springfield Boulevard in southeastern Queens via the Atlantic Branch of the Long Island Rail Road.|$|E
25|$|Jamaica is home {{to large}} African American and Caribbean populations. There are also middle-class African American and Caribbean neighborhoods such as Saint Albans, Queens Village, Cambria Heights, Springfield Gardens, Rosedale, Laurelton, and <b>Briarwood</b> along east and {{southeast}} Queens.|$|E
25|$|In December 1973, delegates, {{representing}} some 260 congregations with {{a combined}} communicant membership of over 41,000 that had left the PCUS, gathered at <b>Briarwood</b> Presbyterian Church in Birmingham, Alabama, and organized the National Presbyterian Church, which later became the Presbyterian Church in America.|$|E
25|$|Neighboring {{areas are}} Jamaica Estates, Jamaica Hills, Holliswood, Bellerose, <b>Briarwood,</b> Cambria Heights, St. Albans, Hollis, Queens Village, South Ozone Park, Kew Gardens, Richmond Hill, Laurelton, Rosedale, Brookville, Rochdale, South Jamaica, Springfield Gardens, Hillcrest, Kew Gardens Hills, Fresh Meadows, Meadowmere Park, and Woodhaven.|$|E
25|$|The Southern Baptist Convention has 673 congregations and 336,000 {{members in}} the Birmingham Metro area. The United Methodists have 196 congregations and 66,759 members. The {{headquarters}} of the Presbyterian Church in America had been in Birmingham until the early 1980s; the PCA has more than 30 congregations and almost 15,000 {{members in the}} Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan area with megachurches such as <b>Briarwood</b> Presbyterian Church. The National Baptist Convention has 126 congregations and 69,800 members.|$|E
25|$|Union Turnpike travels through, {{and serving}} as the {{northern}} border between the towns of Flushing and Jamaica. Though both towns were absorbed into New York City in 1898, the division is evident today in the addresses. Buildings {{on the north side}} generally begin with a 113- ZIP Code, indicating Flushing, and buildings to the south side begin with a 114- ZIP Code, indicating Jamaica. Union Turnpike separates the northern boundaries of <b>Briarwood,</b> Jamaica Hills and Jamaica Estates from the southern boundaries of Flushing and Fresh Meadows.|$|E
25|$|Hillside Avenue {{is one of}} {{the main}} {{thoroughfares}} of Jamaica. It is served by the , from Sutphin Boulevard to its 179th Street terminus. Hillside Avenue runs east from Myrtle Avenue in Richmond Hill, along the length of Jamaica, into Queens Village, and finally, Nassau County. It is a wide six-lane street with numerous commercial activities. The Q43 bus runs its entire eastern length starting at Sutphin Boulevard to the city line. Hillside Avenue separates Jamaica from <b>Briarwood,</b> Jamaica Hills and Jamaica Estates on the southern boundary.|$|E
25|$|In June 1999, the Q44 began limited-stop {{service in}} Queens, with the Q20 {{split into two}} {{branches}} (Q20A and Q20B) to provide local service. Weekend service was also restored on the Q20A. Since the Q44 became limited, the Q20 was extended south along Main Street to make local stops. At this time, the Q44 was shifted from its historical route {{in the neighborhood of}} <b>Briarwood</b> between Union Turnpike and Hillside Avenue. It had previously turned east onto the Grand Central Parkway service road and then turned south onto 150th Street towards Jamaica, the same route employed since 1938 when Main Street dead-ended at the Grand Central service road. It was rerouted to continue south via Main Street, and then via Queens Boulevard to Hillside Avenue.|$|E
25|$|Timothy Jackson {{operated}} a horse boarding stable {{near where the}} intersection of Park Drive East and Union Turnpike, or the Kew Gardens Interchange is today. On {{what is now the}} Jamaica subway yard was previously a horse race course, built by Timothy Jackson, and was known as Whitepot Race & Track. Although the train yard is not in Jamaica, it is named Jamaica because the yard feeds the subway lines which begin (or end) in Jamaica. This area was an extension of Timothy Jackson's Willow Glen Farm for which the farmhouse was located south of Union Turnpike in the neighborhood of Jamaica that is now called <b>Briarwood.</b> In the 1750s, William Furman was the owner of the farm he named Willow Glen. Today Willow Lake, {{at the southern end of}} Flushing Meadows–Corona Park, retains the Willow name.|$|E
25|$|Metro Detroit {{has many}} major {{enclosed}} {{shopping malls and}} open-air lifestyle centers with many restaurants. The upscale Somerset Collection mall in Troy is among the top privately held mall properties in the U.S. with 2004 annual sales of about $600 million and sales per square foot at $620 compared to {{the national average of}} $341. The Mall at Partridge Creek is an upscale open-air lifestyle center located in Clinton Township. Another upscale open-air lifestyle center is The Village of Rochester Hills. Other notable enclosed shopping malls in Metro Detroit include Lakeside Mall in Sterling Heights, Laurel Park Place in Livonia, Twelve Oaks Mall in Novi, which was expanded in 2007 to include Nordstrom, and Great Lakes Crossing Outlets in Auburn Hills. Ann Arbor, a college town, contains traditional street-side shopping along with the enclosed <b>Briarwood</b> Mall.|$|E
25|$|As proposed, {{the line}} would have {{followed}} the Willamette Shore Trolley (WST) right-of-way, extending from the current SW Lowell St. terminus down SW Moody Avenue and proceeding along the WST right-of-way to Lake Oswego, with a terminus near a shopping center at N State St. and North Shore Blvd. The WST alignment was thought to relieve traffic congestion on Oregon Route 43, which parallels it and on some sections has steep hillsides {{where it would be}} cost-prohibitive to widen the highway. The route would have had 10 or 11 stations along the alignment and would be mostly double-track with two or three single-track segments where the alignment is too narrow to widen. Stops would be at Hamilton Ct., Boundary St., Pendleton St., Carolina St., Nevada St., Sellwood Bridge, Riverwood Rd., <b>Briarwood</b> Rd., 'B' Ave., and the terminus. Up to 400 park-and-ride spaces would have been included near the terminus.|$|E
500|$|Coral Springs is a {{sprawling}} city, with few tall or prominent structures. The tallest {{building in the}} city is a 12-story condominium (Country Club Tower), with five more buildings topping out at 10 stories, including three office buildings lining University Drive, one of the city's main roads. [...] Buildings include Preferred Exchange Tower (originally the Bank of Coral Springs Building), 210 Tower, Bank of America Center and the <b>Briarwood</b> Towers.|$|E
500|$|As a {{breeding}} stallion, Go Man Go {{continued to have}} {{a reputation as a}} scoundrel, although Kathlyn Green, wife of A. B. Green, disputed that image. She said that he liked to have his lip tugged, and would lean over the stall door waiting for people to come along and tug on it for him. However, she said of him [...] "he absolutely hated getting his feet dirty". Go Man Go passed through a number of hands after Green owned him, including Les Gosselin, Frank Vessels, and Harriett Peckham, who was his owner by 1972. In 1967, when Vessels sold his half-interest in Go Man Go to <b>Briarwood</b> Farms, the deal was said to be a record price for a Quarter Horse. Go Man Go died in 1983 and was buried near the headquarters of the Buena Suerte Ranch in Roswell, New Mexico. His crown-shaped granite headstone is engraved: [...] "Go Man Go, The King." ...|$|E
500|$|The line's {{construction}} in the 1920s and 1930s promoted housing growth along the Queens Boulevard corridor and stimulated the urbanization of central Queens. However, there are multiple provisions for spur routes along the Queens Boulevard line that were never built. The most notable of these proposals was the IND Second System, which would have provided a spur to Maspeth from the Jackson Heights–Roosevelt Avenue station; another spur to the Rockaways east of 63rd Drive–Rego Park via the Rockaway Beach Branch; a third spur east of <b>Briarwood</b> along the former Van Wyck Boulevard to South Ozone Park; and {{an extension of the}} line eastward past 179th Street. Other proposals included a [...] "super express bypass" [...] that would use the right-of-way of the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line to bypass all stations between 36th Street and 71st Avenue, as well as a spur from the Woodhaven Boulevard station northeast to Queens College via the Long Island Expressway.|$|E
500|$|During daytime hours, {{the portion}} of the line between 36th Street and Forest Hills–71st Avenue is served by four services: the , , , and [...] The M {{operates}} via Sixth Avenue and 53rd Street to Queens Plaza before making local stops to Forest Hills–71st Avenue on weekdays. The R enters Queens Boulevard from the Broadway Line and the 60th Street Tunnel before making local stops to Forest Hills–71st Avenue at all times except late nights. The F train joins the IND Queens Boulevard Line from the 63rd Street Line and runs express to Forest Hills–71st Avenue before making local stops to Jamaica–179th Street at all times. The E train runs from the Eighth Avenue Line and 53rd Street to Queens Boulevard before making express stops along the line (except evenings and weekends when it makes all stops east of Forest Hills–71st Avenue and during late night hours when it runs local on the entire line) to the Archer Avenue Line east of <b>Briarwood.</b> Limited rush hour E trains also run express to Jamaica–179th Street.|$|E
500|$|In December 1988, the Archer Avenue Lines opened, {{utilizing}} {{existing provisions}} {{east of the}} <b>Briarwood</b> station. The E was rerouted to its current terminus at Jamaica Center. In December 2001, the connection to the IND 63rd Street Line (built along with the Archer Avenue subway), was opened and F trains were rerouted away from the 53rd Street tunnel. Around this time, the G was truncated to Court Square during peak hours and the [...] train was created to replace the F via 53rd Street. Starting in August 2007 {{after a series of}} severe summer storms, the MTA began installing decorative ventilation grates along the Hillside Avenue section of the line, and sealing other grates, both in order to combat flooding. At the time, the Hillside Avenue subway was considered the most flood-prone area in the subway system, due to its location {{at the bottom of the}} terminal moraine which runs across Long Island. Additional grates were later installed along Broadway and Steinway Street at the west end of the line.|$|E
500|$|Park Creek enters {{from the}} right at RM1.80 (RK2.90). Slightly below the confluence, the creek passes under the Red Fox Bridge, which carries the Red Fox Trail. Thereafter, the creek runs roughly {{parallel}} to the South Creek Trail, {{which is on the}} right for about [...] The creek receives Red Fox Creek {{from the right}} and Palatine Hill Creek from the left, then flows out of Portland and Multnomah County and into the city of Lake Oswego and Clackamas County. The stream then passes under the Iron Mountain Bridge, which carries the Iron Mountain Trail. Just below the bridge, Nettle Creek enters from the right at [...] from the mouth, and shortly thereafter the creek passes a United States Geological Survey (USGS) stream gauge, which is on the right. The creek leaves the Tryon Creek State Natural Area just before entering a [...] culvert under Oregon Route 43 at RM0.24 (RK0.39) and soon thereafter a set of Union Pacific Railroad tracks. Below this, Tryon Creek forms the boundary between the city of Lake Oswego and <b>Briarwood,</b> an unincorporated Clackamas County community, which is to the left. The Tryon Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant is on the right during this last stretch before the creek enters the Willamette River about [...] upstream from its confluence with the Columbia River.|$|E

2500|$|The {{traditional}} {{core of the}} Village of Midlothian on Route 60 {{is between}} two major shopping malls developed later. Midlothian has many neighborhoods; Some examples off Route 60 include <b>Briarwood,</b> Roxshire, and Salisbury to the north; and Walton Park, Queensmill, and Stonehenge West to the south. Woodlake, Virginia and Brandermill, Virginia are communities on Route 360 or Hull St.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{documented}} English settlement {{within the}} present city limits of Bridgeport {{took place in}} 1644, centered at Black Rock Harbor and along North Avenue between Park and <b>Briarwood</b> avenues. The place was called Pequonnock (Quiripi for [...] "Cleared Land"), after a band of the Paugussett, an Algonquian-speaking Native American people who occupied this area. One of their sacred sites was Golden Hill, which overlooked the harbor and was the location of natural springs and their planting fields. (It has since been blasted through for construction of an expressway.) The Golden Hill Indians were granted a reservation here by the Colony of Connecticut in 1639; it lasted until 1802. (One of the tribe acquired land for a small reservation in the late 19th century that was recognized by the state. It is retained in the Town of Trumbull.) ...|$|E
