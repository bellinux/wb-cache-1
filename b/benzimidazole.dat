25|$|Rabeprazole {{is a novel}} <b>benzimidazole</b> {{compound}} on market, since 1999 in USA. It {{is similar}} to lansoprazole in having no substituents on its <b>benzimidazole</b> part and a methyl group at site 3 on the pyridine, {{the only difference is}} the methoxypropoxy substitution at site 4 instead of the trifluoroethoxy group on lansoprazole.|$|E
25|$|Candesartan {{cilexetil}} (TCV 116) is a <b>benzimidazole</b> {{which was}} developed at Takeda {{and is an}} ester carbonate prodrug.

In the interaction of candesartan with AT1 receptor the carboxyl group of the <b>benzimidazole</b> ring plays an important role. Candesartan and its prodrug have stronger blood pressure lowering effects than EXP 3174 and losartan.|$|E

40|$|Spectral Properties of <b>Benzimidazoles</b> Marie Lukešová Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Králové Department of Biophysics and Physical Chemistry Abstract: This diploma thesis {{deals with}} the {{spectral}} properties of <b>benzimidazoles.</b> Most of <b>benzimidazoles</b> are anthelmintic active drug, used primarily in veterinary medicine. Some substances are used as fungicides. The main {{aim of this study}} was to clarify the influence of solvents on the absorption spectra and especially on the fluorescence of <b>benzimidazoles.</b> The influence of aprotic and protic solvent, the influence of polarity of solvent and the influence of pH of solvents were studied. The thesis includes two parts: theoretical and practical. In the theoretical part physicochemical properties of <b>benzimidazoles,</b> <b>benzimidazoles</b> possibility of detection, UV-VIS and fluorescence spectrophotometry are summarized. In the practical part results of the measurement are processed into tables and graphs. It was found that the influence of solvent depends on the structure of the substance. Therefore it is necessary to check each substance separately...|$|R

25|$|The {{story of}} pantoprazole's {{discovery}} {{is a good}} example of the stepwise development of PPIs. The main focus of modification of timoprazole was the <b>benzimidazole</b> part of its structure. Addition of a trifluoromethyl group to the <b>benzimidazole</b> moiety led to a series of very active compounds with varying solution-stability. In general fluoro substituents were found to block metabolism at the point where they were attached. Later the more balanced fluoroalkoxy substituent, instead of the highly lipophilic and strongly electron-withdrawing trifluoromethyl substituent, led to highly active compounds with supposed longer half-lives and higher solution stability.|$|E
25|$|PPIs can {{be split}} into two groups based on their basic structure. Though all have a {{substituted}} pyridine part, one group has it linked to various benzimidazoles but the other has it linked to a substituted imidazopyridine. All marketed PPIs (omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, etc.) are in the <b>benzimidazole</b> group.|$|E
25|$|Gordon {{also played}} a major role in the {{introduction}} of thiabendazole (a member of the <b>benzimidazole</b> family) as an anthelmintic for sheep in the early 1960s.

25|$|The {{difference}} in the structural backbone of tenatoprazole compared to <b>benzimidazole</b> PPIs, is its imidazopyridine moiety, which reduces the rate of metabolism, allowing a longer plasma residence time but also decreases the pKa of the fused imidazole N {{as compared to the}} current PPIs. Tenatoprazole has the same substituents as omeprazole, the methoxy groups at position 6 on the imidazopyridine and at position 4 on the pyridine part as well as two methyl groups at position 3 and 5 on the pyridine.|$|E
25|$|Reaction with {{cysteine}} 822 confers {{a rather}} special property to the covalently inhibited enzyme, namely irreversibility to reducing agents. The likely {{first step is}} binding of the prodrug protonated on the pyridine of the compound with cysteine 813. Then the second proton is added with acid transport by the H+/K+ ATPase, and the compound is activated. Recent data suggest the hydrated sulfenic acid to be the reactive species forming directly from the mono-protonated <b>benzimidazole</b> bound {{on the surface of}} the pump.|$|E
25|$|Evidence emerged {{by the end}} of the 1970s {{that the}} newly {{discovered}} proton pump (H+/K+ ATPase) in the secretory membrane of the parietal cell was the final step in acid secretion. Literature from anaesthetic screenings led attention to the potential antiviral compound pyridylthioacetamide which after further examination pointed the focus on an anti-secretory compound with unknown mechanisms of action called timoprazole. Timoprazole is a pyridylmethylsulfinyl <b>benzimidazole</b> and appealed due to its simple chemical structure and its surprisingly high level of anti-secretory activity.|$|E
40|$|An {{efficient}} {{and a quick}} microwave-assisted synthesis of <b>benzimidazoles</b> and trisubstituted imidazoles was developed.

25|$|It was {{realized}} that activity was somehow linked to instability in solution {{and then came}} to the conclusion that the cyclic sulfenamides, formed in acidic conditions, were the active principle of the PPIs. Finally, it was understood that seemingly small alterations in the backbone of timoprazole led nowhere, and focus had to be centered on the substituents on the backbone. However, necessary intramolecular rearrangement of the <b>benzimidazole</b> into sulfenamide posed severe geometric constraints. Optimal compounds would be those that were stable at neutral pH but were quickly activated at low pH.|$|E
25|$|In heterocyclic {{aromatics}} (heteroaromatics), {{one or more}} of {{the atoms}} in the aromatic ring is of an element other than carbon. This can lessen the ring's aromaticity, and thus (as in the case of furan) increase its reactivity. Other examples include pyridine, pyrazine, pyrrole, imidazole, pyrazole, oxazole, thiophene, and their benzannulated analogs (<b>benzimidazole,</b> for example). In all these examples, the number of π-electrons is 6, due to the π-electrons from the double bonds as well as the two electrons from any lone pair that is in the p-orbital that is in the plane of the aromatic π system. For example, in pyridine, the five sp2-hybridized carbons each have a p-orbital that is perpendicular to the plane of the ring, and each of these p-orbitals contains one π-electron. Additionally, the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and has one electron in a p-orbital, which adds up to 6 p-electrons, thus making pyridine aromatic. The lone pair on the nitrogen is not part of the aromatic π system. Pyrrole and imidazole are both five membered aromatic rings that contain heteroatoms. In pyrrole, each of the four sp2-hybridized carbons contributes one π-electron, and the nitrogen atom is also sp2-hybridized and contributes two π-electrons from its lone pair, which occupies a p-orbital. In imidazole, both nitrogens are sp2-hybridized; the one in the double bond contributes one electron and the one which is not in the double bond and is in a lone pair contributes two electrons to the π system.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1975, {{timoprazole}} {{was found to}} inhibit acid secretion irrespective of stimulus, extracellular or intracellular. Studies on timoprazole revealed enlargement of the thyroid gland due to inhibition of iodine uptake as well as atrophy of the thymus gland. A literature search showed that some substituted mercapto-benzimidazoles {{had no effect on}} iodine uptake and introduction of such substituents into timoprazole resulted in an elimination of the toxic effects, without reducing the antisecretory effect. A derivative of timoprazole, omeprazole, was discovered in 1979, and was the first of a new class of drug that control acid secretion in the stomach, a proton pump inhibitor (PPI). Addition of 5-methoxy-substitution to the <b>benzimidazole</b> moiety of omeprazole was also made and gave the compound much more stability at neutral pH. In 1980, an Investigational New Drug (IND) application was filed and omeprazole was taken into Phase III human trials in 1982. A new approach for the treatment of acid-related diseases was introduced, and omeprazole was quickly shown to be clinically superior to the histamine H2 receptor antagonists, and was launched in 1988 as Losec in Europe, and in 1990 as Prilosec in the United States. In 1996, Losec became the world's biggest ever selling pharmaceutical, and by 2004 over 800 million patients had been treated with the drug worldwide. During the 1980s, about 40 other companies entered the PPIs area, but few achieved market success: Takeda with lansoprazole, Byk Gulden (now Nycomed) with pantoprazole, and Eisai with rabeprazole, all of which were analogues of omeprazole.|$|E

40|$|Isolates of Botrytis cinerea Pers. : Fr. from {{different}} crops and localities in Greece {{were compared with}} reference isolates from France and Israel and classified into various groups {{on the basis of}} their sensitivity to dicarboximides and <b>benzimidazoles.</b> Some isolates had a low resistance to both fungicides (spore germination and mycelial growth occurred on medium containing 3 mu g iprodione ml(- 1) or 1 mu g carbendazim ml(- 1)). These isolates were insensitive to phenylcarbamates (spore germination and mycelial growth on 100 mu g diethofencarb ml(- 1)). Many isolates had a high resistance to <b>benzimidazoles</b> (spore germination and mycelial growth on medium containing 100 mu g carbendazim ml(- 1)); these isolates showed negative cross-resistance to phenylcarbamates (spore germination and mycelial growth inhibited on 1 mu g diethofencarb ml(- 1)). Some isolates exhibited reduced sensitivity to dichlofluanid (spore germination on medium containing 1 mu g fungicide ml(- 1)). Infections caused by isolates resistant to dicarboximides or to both dicarboximides and <b>benzimidazoles</b> were uncommon at the beginning of each new crop cycle. However, both disease incidence and frequencies of infection by such isolates increased substantially as the season progressed and then declined after cessation of fungicide sprays. In contrast, infections caused by isolates that showed high resistance to <b>benzimidazoles</b> but were sensitive to dicarboximides were frequent throughout the growing season. There were no infections caused by strains resistant to both <b>benzimidazoles</b> and phenylcarbamates at sites treated with carbendazim plus diethofencarb. The reduced efficacy of this mixture could be due to its inferior activity in vitro against isolates exhibiting high resistance to <b>benzimidazoles</b> and negatively correlated cross-resistance to diethofencarb.

40|$|Alveolar {{echinococcosis}} {{is caused}} by the parasitic cestode Echinococcus multilocularis. <b>Benzimidazoles,</b> namely, mebendazole and albendazole, are the only drugs available for the treatment of inoperable alveolar echinococcosis. At present, no therapeutic alternative is available for patients with progressive disease under treatment or for patients who are unable to tolerate the side effects of the <b>benzimidazoles.</b> In addition, <b>benzimidazoles</b> are only parasitostatic for E. multilocularis. Thus, new therapeutic options are of paramount importance. In the present study we examined the in vitro effect of amphotericin B on E. multilocularis larvae. E. multilocularis metacestodes grown in the peritoneal cavities of Mongolian gerbils were transferred into a culture system. Vesicles budded from the tissue blocks and increased in number and size during the first 5 weeks. After 6 weeks drugs were added and deleterious effects on the vesicles were observed macroscopically and microscopically. By use of this in vitro tissue culture model we demonstrated that amphotericin B effectively inhibits the growth of E. multilocularis metacestodes. This destructive effect was significantly more rapid with amphotericin B than with the <b>benzimidazoles.</b> Cyclic treatment was effective in suppressing parasite growth. However, amphotericin B appears to be parasitostatic for E. multilocularis larvae, and regrowth occurs even after extended periods.
