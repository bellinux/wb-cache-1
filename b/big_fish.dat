5|$|Burton {{planned to}} start filming in October 2002, but {{principal}} photography in Alabama {{did not begin}} until January 13, 2003. Apart from filming in Paris for one week in May, <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> was entirely shot in Alabama, mostly in Wetumpka and Montgomery (such as the Cloverdale neighborhood). Brief filming also took place in Tallassee and {{on the campus of}} Huntingdon College. Scenes for the town of Spectre were filmed on a custom set located on an island in Lake Jackson between Montgomery and Millbrook, Alabama, adjacent to the Alabama River. Principal photography for <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> in Alabama continued until the first week of April. and is estimated to have generated as much as $25 million for the local economy.|$|E
5|$|Over time, {{the company}} reformulates various {{products}} {{in an attempt}} to boost sales of the product or to improve the taste, appearance, or physical consistency of the product. One such example of this is the BK <b>Big</b> <b>Fish,</b> the company's fish sandwich offering in North America. Burger King's original fish sandwich, introduced as early as the late 1960s in some markets, was called the Whaler; it was a smaller fish sandwich made with tartar sauce and lettuce served on the small sesame seed roll BK used for their hamburgers. When Burger King introduced its broiled chicken sandwich in 1990, the BK Broiler, it changed the fish sandwich's breading to a panko style, began serving it on an oatmeal-dusted roll that was used for the broiled chicken sandwich, and renamed the product the Ocean Catch sandwich. When BK reformulated the BK Broiler, the company also reformulated the Ocean Catch as the BK <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> in its current configuration. The sandwich was again briefly reformulated after the phase-out of the Baguette sandwiches, and was reintroduced as the <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{director}} {{attempted to}} limit the use of digital effects. However, {{because he wanted to}} evoke a Southern Gothic fantasy tone for <b>Big</b> <b>Fish,</b> color grading techniques were applied by Sony Pictures Imageworks. Stan Winston Studios, with whom Burton worked with on Edward Scissorhands (1990) and Batman Returns (1992), designed Helena Bonham Carter's prosthetic makeup and created the animatronics. Scenes with Karl the Giant were commissioned using forced perspective filmmaking.|$|E

Dude Ranch was the band's final recording released on Cargo and their last with original drummer Scott Raynor before he was dismissed from the band in 1998 and the last to feature their full original lineup.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{theme of}} {{reconciliation}} between a dying {{father and his}} son had special significance for Burton, as his father had died in 2000 and his mother in 2002, a month before he signed on to direct. <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> was shot on location in Alabama {{in a series of}} fairy tale vignettes evoking the tone of a Southern Gothic fantasy. The film received award nominations in multiple film categories, including four Golden Globe Award nominations, seven nominations from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, two Saturn Award nominations, and an Oscar and a Grammy Award nomination for Danny Elfman's original score.|$|E
5|$|Verbinski cast James Gandolfini as Carl Hanratty, Ed Harris as Frank Abagnale, Sr., and Chloë Sevigny as Brenda Strong. Verbinski {{dropped out}} because of DiCaprio's {{commitment}} on Gangs of New York. Lasse Hallström was in negotiations to direct by May 2001, but dropped out in July 2001. At this stage Harris and Sevigny left the film, but Gandolfini was still attached. Spielberg, co-founder of DreamWorks, offered the job of director to Miloš Forman, and considered hiring Cameron Crowe. During this negotiation period, Spielberg began to consider directing the film himself, eventually dropping projects such as <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> and Memoirs of a Geisha. Spielberg officially committed to directing in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|Burton {{had never}} been {{particularly}} close to his parents, but his father's death in October 2000 and his mother's in March 2002 affected him deeply. Following the production of Planet of the Apes (2001), the director {{wanted to get back}} to making a smaller film. Burton enjoyed the script, feeling that it was the first unique story he was offered since Beetlejuice (1988). Burton also found appeal in the story's combination of an emotional drama with exaggerated tall tales, which allowed him to tell various stories of different genres. He signed to direct in April 2002, which prompted Richard D. Zanuck, who worked with Burton on Planet of the Apes, to join <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> as a producer. Zanuck also had a difficult relationship with his own father, Darryl F. Zanuck, who once fired him as head of production at 20th Century Fox.|$|E

5|$|Lurie's script {{received}} a rewrite by Pamela Pettler, {{who worked with}} Burton on Corpse Bride, but the director hired <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> screenwriter John August in December 2003 to start from scratch. Both August and Burton were fans of the book since their childhoods. August first read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory when he was eight years old, and subsequently sent Dahl a fan letter. He {{did not see the}} 1971 film prior to his hiring, which Burton believed would be fundamental in having August stay closer to the book. The writer updated the Mike Teavee character into an obsessive video game player, as compared to the novel, in which he fantasized about violent crime films. The characters Arthur Slugworth and Prodnose were reduced to brief cameo appearances, while Mr. Beauregarde was entirely omitted.|$|E
5|$|With the {{breakthrough}} of third wave ska into the American mainstream by late 1996, the Daddies seemed poised for commercial success, landing {{a spot on}} a well-publicized national tour with popular ska bands Reel <b>Big</b> <b>Fish</b> and Let's Go Bowling. Although the band were mainly playing ska shows at the time, they soon began drawing a sizable following for their swing material when the coincident success of the film Swingers and its featured band Big Bad Voodoo Daddy started drawing public and media attention towards the formerly underground swing revival movement. When fans regularly began approaching the band's merchandise table asking which of their albums contained the most swing, the Daddies realized they lacked an album fully representing their swing side, prompting the band's manager to convince them to compile all of their swing songs onto one CD until {{they could afford to}} make a new album, using their available finances to record several bonus tracks for inclusion. The result, , became an unexpectedly popular item as the band went on tour, reportedly selling as many as 4,000 copies a week through their Northwest distributors.|$|E

40|$|Mature female {{groupers}} (Epinephelus coioides) {{of different}} sizes were stocked in three floating net cages (2 fishes each) and in tanks (2 - 4 fishes) to induce sex change in the bigger female grouper after isolation from the original group. All the <b>bigger</b> <b>fish</b> (initial body weight 5. 0 - 6. 1 kg) in the floating net cages changed into males {{by the end of}} the experiment, while the smaller ones (initial body weight 4. 5 - 5. 2 kg) remained female. The fastest sex change was in cage 1 where the <b>bigger</b> <b>fish</b> had atretic oocytes one month after stocking and was milting after four months. In the other cages, milt production in the <b>bigger</b> <b>fish</b> was observed 6 - 10 months after stocking. In the tank-reared groupers, the <b>biggest</b> <b>fish</b> (initial body weight 6. 4 kg) in the tank with four fishes was found to be milting about two months after stocking while the smaller fishes (initial body weight 3. 4 - 4. 0 kg) were still females. The fishes started to spawn two months later. In another tank that was stocked with two females, no sex change was observed in the <b>bigger</b> <b>fish</b> even 16 months after stocking. These results indicate that female groupers can be sexually changed into male by social control at the shortest period of four months in floating net cages and two months in tanks. However, there may be cases wherein sex change will not occur...|$|R
