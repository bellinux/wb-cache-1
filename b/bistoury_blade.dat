40|$|Introduction and objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to analyze theinfiltration of the sealers AH Plus®, Sealapex®, Sealer 26 ® and Endofill®,using {{clearing}} teeth technique. Material and methods: Fifty single-rooted teeth had its crowns removed and canals prepared by the Oregon modified technique. After the chemical-mechanical preparation, the root canals were filled with gutta-percha and four different sealers:group I: AH Plus®; group II: Sealapex®; group III: Sealer 26 ® and group IV: Endofill®. The others two groups of five teeth each served as positive and negative control groups. After filling, teeth remained for 60 days in saline solution 0. 9 %, simulating oral conditions. Following this stage,teeth were covered by three layers of nail polish, immersed in nankin ink and stored in a stove under 37 ºC for 48 hours. After this period of time, the samples were washed in current water for 24 hours, the nail varnishes were removed with <b>bistoury</b> <b>blade</b> and the clearing technique was applied to evaluate the results. Results and conclusion: The results showed insignificant differences between the materials tested and so a similar behavior in the apical marginal infiltration...|$|E
40|$|Background In Iranian {{traditional}} medicine, Punica granatum, cabbage, and plantago {{have been}} used to prompt wound healing. The effects of cabbage, Punica granatum, and Plantago in wound healing have been investigated to some extent, but no experimental study has been performed {{to assess the impact of}} an ointment containing all these three substances on wound healing. Objectives The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of an ointment prepared from a mixture of cabbage, Punica granatum, and plantago on local wound healing in Wistar rats. Materials and Methods This experimental study was performed on 21 male Wistar rats. Firstly, a full thickness wound was created on rats flank, near the spine by a <b>bistoury</b> <b>blade</b> and forceps. Then they were randomly divided into three groups of seven rats as the control group, a positive control group (the treatment group with phenytoin), and the third one received a treatment with studied ointment. The wounds were evaluated on days three, six, nine, and 12. Results were compared by SPSS software using ANOVA test. Results The average percentage of wound healing in different groups on days 3, 6, 9 and 12 were as follows; 21. 3 %, 37. 87 %, 67. 39 % and 77. 17 % in control group; 24. 98 %, 34. 21 %, 70. 74 % and 88. 55 % in positive control group; and 32. 35 %, 61. 27 %, 94. 53 %, and 99. 91 %, in case group. A significant difference was observed between the control and case groups (P < 0. 05). Conclusions Treatment with the studied ointment could promote wound healing...|$|E
