25|$|Existing {{in a kind}} of Neverland where money {{never came}} in, schemes never stayed out for very long, yet no one living or visiting went wanting, 79 Wistful Vista (the McGees' address from show #20, August 1935 onward) became the home Depression-exhausted Americans visited to remind {{themselves}} that they were not the only ones finding cheer in the middle of struggle and doing their <b>best</b> <b>not</b> to make it overt. The McGees won their house in a raffle from Mr. Hagglemeyer's Wistful Vista Development Company, with lottery ticket #131,313, happened upon by chance while on a pleasure drive in their car. With blowhard McGee wavering between mundane tasks and hare-brained schemes (like digging an oil well in the back yard), antagonizing as many people as possible, and patient Molly indulging his foibles and providing loving support, not to mention a tireless parade of neighbors and friends {{in and out of the}} quiet home, Fibber McGee and Molly built its audience steadily, but once it found the full volume of that audience in 1940, they rarely let go of it.|$|E
25|$|After {{the revelation}} about the affidavit, {{a series of}} grand jury {{investigations}} were begun into the cover-up activities of Jefferson County officials. The investigation revealed that high-ranking county officials had met {{a few days after}} the massacre to discuss the release of the affidavit to the public. It was decided that because the affidavit's contents lacked the necessary probable cause to have supported the issuance of a search warrant for the Harris household by a judge, it would be <b>best</b> <b>not</b> to disclose the affidavit's existence at an upcoming press conference, although the actual conversations and points of discussion were never revealed to anyone other than the grand jury members. Following the press conference, the original Guerra documents disappeared. In September 1999, a Jefferson County investigator failed to find the documents during a secret search of the county's computer system. A second attempt in late 2000 found copies of the document within the Jefferson County archives. The documents were reconstructed and released to the public in September 2001, but the original documents are still missing. The final grand jury investigation was released in September 2004.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} {{critically}} acclaimed. Jesse Hassenger of PopMatters wrote that [...] "the season finale showcased the series at its surprising and funny <b>best,</b> <b>not</b> its rushed and convoluted worst." [...] He called {{the reversal of}} the rape plot line a [...] "gimmicky reversal" [...] but that [...] "thematically it worked." [...] The reviewer commented positively on the reveal of Beaver as the murderer {{as well as the}} cliffhanger. [...] "The season's low-key but effective cliffhanger…suggested again that her life, however charmed and TV-ish it can seem, remains in youthful flux." ...|$|E

500|$|But Eustace Roskill {{cautions}} that [...] "It {{would be wrong}} to judge Stevenson simply by the notoriety of a few cases.... he showed great mercy to those whom he saw to be victims rather than aggressors." [...] In the early 1970s, while conducting training sessions in sentencing for newly appointed recorders, Stevenson summed up his attitude: [...] "You sentence off the top of your head. If the man's a shit, down he goes. If there's {{something to be said for}} him, you do your <b>best</b> <b>not</b> to put him inside." [...] Despite his stern and authoritarian reputation, in the 1970s he sometimes submitted letters to the Court of Appeal supporting the reduction of his sentences.|$|E

The song's hook {{is built around}} a piano melody and [...] "circular keyboard line", and features [...] "a stuttering mid-tempo beat that's accented by finger snaps and electronic synthesizers" [...] as its instrumentation. Lyrically, the song describes the protagonist revealing several bedroom fantasies in which {{she would like to}} engage in, asking her lover playfully to [...] "touch her body". According to Ben Ratliff from The New York Times, it's a [...] "questionably sexy striptease: a goofy-sleazy tryst vignette", with Carey singing [...] "If there's a camera up in here then I <b>best</b> <b>not</b> catch this flick on YouTube." ...|$|E
500|$|Blue Velvet was {{released}} to a polarized reception in the United States. The critics who did praise the film were often vociferous. The New York Times critic Janet Maslin directed much praise toward {{the performances of}} Hopper and Rossellini: [...] "Mr. Hopper and Miss Rossellini are so far outside the bounds of ordinary acting here that their performances are best {{understood in terms of}} sheer lack of inhibition; both give themselves entirely over to the material, which seems to be exactly what's called for." [...] She called it [...] "an instant cult classic." [...] Maslin concluded by saying that Blue Velvet [...] "is as fascinating as it is freakish.

500|$|The {{controversy}} promoted polemics regarding September Morn and censorship, {{and multiple}} editorial cartoons; one depicted {{a young woman}} bathing, only her head showing, with a caption attributed to Comstock reading [...] "Don't you suppose I can imagine what is UNDER the water?". Comstock called the work [...] "demoralizing in the extreme and especially calculated to excite immodesty in the young", arguing {{that it must be}} suppressed {{in the interest of the}} children. He emphasized that [...] "the law is the law... the picture will have to come out of the window". Reverend Sydney Ussher of St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church took a more moderate approach, explaining that [...] "so vivid a display of nudity as September Morn" [...] would <b>best</b> <b>not</b> be displayed in the United States, owing to the people's relative lack of appreciation for art.|$|E
500|$|Reviewer Alan Sepinwall {{also had}} mixed comments, {{comparing}} the episode to House and stating, [...] "And yet {{as much as}} Veronica was annoying me, as much as I wanted to yell at her for automatically jumping to conclusions with Weevil (more on that in a minute), this was maybe my favorite episode of the season. [...] Hell, they even had a cliffhanger ending to the mystery arc {{for the first time}} in forever. I dug it." [...] Price Peterson of TV.com gave a mostly negative review, writing, [...] "This episode was not the <b>best!</b> <b>Not</b> terrible by any means, but it felt lacking in certain ways, particularly when it came to the total lack of Piz and Dick. Where were they? Also this episode made it clear that Logan didn't have all that much to do on the show anymore." ...|$|E
500|$|The Times {{obtained}} opinions {{from four}} sexual-abuse experts, who unanimously opposed using Kids Can Say No! {{or any other}} film to teach children about the subject.

According to teacher Clare Rankin, children under five would not understand the film. Physician Paula Drummond was concerned that it might inspire children to falsely accuse adults they disliked, although McCarthy said that children were unlikely to make false abuse accusations. McCarthy was especially critical of the film, calling it [...] "no clearer to a child than the Gorbachev-Reagan talks". Moorehead summarised the experts' comments as suggesting that Kids Can Say No! is [...] "muddling, evasive and pussy-footed, <b>best</b> <b>not</b> for children at all, but as... aids for parents and professional workers to alert them to paedophilia and incest".|$|E
