The structural, morphological and optical properties of the annealed films are studied using techniques such as x-ray diffraction (XRD), micro-Raman spectroscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy. XRD analysis shows that all the films are well-crystallized in nature with a monoclinic <b>barium</b> <b>tungstate</b> phase. The presence of characteristic modes of the tungstate group in the Raman spectra supports {{the formation of the}} <b>barium</b> <b>tungstate</b> phase in the films. Scanning electron microscopic images of the films present a uniform dense distribution of well-defined grains with different sizes. All the doped films present a broad emission in the 390 ? 500 nm region and its intensity increases up to 3 wt. % and thereafter decreases due to usual concentration quenching...|$|E

On release {{of pressure from}} 15. 8 GPa, the initial phase is recovered implying that the observed structural modifications are reversible. Comment: 23 pages, 9 figures and two table...|$|E

Analysis of our data based on Le bail refinement suggests that this phase could be fergusonite and not mercuric molybdate type, which was proposed earlier from the Raman investigations. Beyond fourteen giga pascal this compound undergoes another phase transformation to a significantly disordered structure. Both the phase transitions {{are found to be}} reversible.

40|$|International Space Station (ISS) plasma {{contactor}} system {{requires a}} hollow cathode assembly (HCA) with {{a lifetime of}} at least 18, 000 hours. In order to demonstrate the lifetime capability of the HCA, a series of hollow cathode wear tests was performed which included a life test operated at the maximum current of the HCA. This test sought to verify hollow cathode lifetime capability and contamination control protocols. This hollow cathode accumulated 27, 800 hours of operation before it failed during a restart attempt. The cathode was subsequently destructively analyzed {{in order to determine}} the failure mechanism. Microscopic examination of the cathode interior determined that relatively small changes in the cathode physical geometry had occurred and <b>barium</b> <b>tungstates,</b> which are known to limit the emission process, had formed over a majority of the electron emitter surface. Because the final state of the insert was consistent with expected impregnate chemistry, the hollow cathode was believed to have reached the end of its usable life under the test conditions...|$|R
40|$|Electric {{thrusters}} use hollow cathodes as {{the electron}} source for generating the plasma discharge and for beam neutralization. These cathodes contain porous tungsten emitters impregnated with BaO material {{to achieve a}} lower surface work function and are operated with xenon propellant. Oxygen contaminants in the xenon plasma can poison the emitter surface, resulting in a higher work function and increased operating temperature. This could lead directly to cathode failure by preventing discharge ignition or could accelerate evaporation of the BaO material. Exposures over hundreds of hours to very high levels of oxygen can result in increased temperatures, oxidation of the tungsten substrate, {{and the formation of}} surface layers of <b>barium</b> <b>tungstates.</b> In this work, we present results of a cathode test in which impregnated tungsten and tungsten-iridium emitters were operated with 100 ppm of oxygen in the xenon plasma for several hundred hours. The chemical and morphological changes were studied using scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive spectroscopy, and laser profilometry. The results provide strong evidence that high concentrations of oxygen accelerate the formation of tungstate layers in both types of emitters, a phenomenon not inherent to normal cathode operation. Deposits of pure tungsten were observed on the W-Ir emitter, indicating that tungsten is preferentially removed from the surface and transported in the insert plasma. A W-Ir cathode surface will therefore evolve to a pure W composition, eliminating the work function benefit of W-Ir. However, the W-Ir emitter exhibited less erosion and redeposition at the upstream end than the pure W emitter...|$|R

These crystals were structurally characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Rietveld refinements, Fourier-transform Raman (FT-Raman) and Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopies. The shape and size of these crystals were observed by field emission scanning electron microcopy (FE-SEM). Their optical properties were investigated by ultraviolet visible (UV-vis) absorption and photoluminescence (PL) measurements. Moreover, we have studied the photocatalytic (PC) activity of crystals for degradation of rhodamine B (RhB) dye. XRD patterns, Rietveld refinements data, FT-Raman and FT-IR spectroscopies indicate that all crystals exhibit a tetragonal structure without deleterious phases. FT-Raman spectra exhibited 13 Raman-active modes in a range from 50 to 1000 cm(- 1), while FT-IR spectra have 8 infrared active modes in a range from 200 to 1050 cm(- 1). FE-SEM images showed different shapes (bonbon-, spindle-, rice-and flake-like) {{as well as a}} reduction in the crystal size with an increase in Pr 3 + ions. A possible growth process was proposed for these crystals. UV-vis absorption measurements revealed a decrease in optical band gap values with an increase of Pr 3 + into the matrix. An intense green PL emission was noted for (Ba 1 -xPr 2 x/ 3) WO 4 crystals (x = 0), while crystals with (x = 0. 01 and 0. 02) produced a reduction in the wide band PL emission and the narrow band PL emission which is related to f-f transitions from Pr 3 + ions. High photocatalytic efficiency was verified for the bonbon-like BaWO 4 crystals as a catalyst in the degradation of the RhB dye after 25 min under UV-light. Finally, we discuss possible mechanisms for PL and PC properties of these crystals.

Coexistence of the scheelite and fergusonite structures was found beyond 7 GPa, both {{at room temperature}} and HT, suggesting a polymorphism zone in the P –T phase diagram. The experiments are complemented by thermodynamic calculations within the quasi-harmonic approximation. At ambient pressure, a volume thermal expansivity of 9. 5 × 10 − 6 K− 1 was obtained for scheelite BaWO 4. At HP, the thermal expansivity of the fergusonite doubles that of scheelite.

40|$|Four hollow cathodes {{have been}} {{examined}} using boroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive X-ray analysis, and X-ray diffraction analysis to characterize the life-limiting phenomena that resulted from their extended operation. The first pair of cathodes was operated for approximately 500 h in an ion thruster simulator at a 5. 0 kW-equivalent power level using different cathode activation and propellant feed-system procedures. The second pair of cathodes was the main discharge cathode and neutralizer cathode from an ion thruster which have completed an 89 -hour life-test at a 5. 5 kW power level. The greatest change to the cathode condition {{was found to be}} removal of refractory metals, primarily tungsten, and their subsequent deposition on other cathode surfaces. <b>Barium</b> <b>tungstate</b> and barium molybdate were also found in all four cathodes.

30|$|<b>Barium</b> <b>tungstate</b> (BaWO 4) is the {{heaviest}} {{member of the}} family of the alkaline earth tungstates. Like many other ABX 4 type compounds, BaWO 4 crystallizes at ambient conditions in the tetragonal scheelite-type structure (space group [SG]: I 41 /a, No. 88, Z =  4) [6]. BaWO 4 is extensively investigated because of its good electrical conductivity, magnetic and photoluminescence properties [7]. As one of the most reactive alkaline earth tungstates, BaWO 4 based materials {{play an important role in}} wide variety of technological applications as light emitting diodes [8], humidity sensors [9], optic filters [10], scintillator detectors [11], photocatalysts [12], microwave dielectrics [13], phosphors [14] and solid state lasers [15]. Recently, many studies have been reported on the preparation and characterization of metal tungstates using various preparation methods such as Czochralski process [16], precipitation method [17], hydrothermal synthesis [18], solid-state reaction [19], pulsed laser deposition method [20], electrochemical process [21], molten salt synthesis [22], polymeric precursor method [23], solvothermal synthesis [24], sonochemical route [25] and DNA-templated synthesis [26].|$|E
40|$|International audiencePure {{microcrystalline}} barium molybdate BaMoO 4 and <b>barium</b> <b>tungstate</b> BaWO 4 {{materials were}} prepared by molten flux reaction using alkali metal nitrates as reaction media. The obtained crystals have rhombic shape and expose mostly (111) crystallographic planes. Their mean size {{depends on the}} flux temperature {{and the nature of}} the alkali metal cation. Monomeric molybdate and tungstate used as precursors yield target products already at 673 K whereas if polymerized ammonium oxosalts were used, then higher temperatures were necessary to obtain barium salts. The optimal temperature for the preparation of pure crystals with well defined shape was found to be near 773 K. UV–visible spectra have been measured to precise energy gaps in these important d 0 transition metal compounds. The values of Eg for these two mixed oxides are 4. 3 eV for BaMoO 4 and 3. 8 eV for BaWO 4. Such values contradict to what can be expected from the known data on their structure and the relative electronegativity of W and Mo ions.

40|$|Room-temperature Raman {{scattering}} {{has been}} measured in <b>barium</b> <b>tungstate</b> (BaWO 4) up to 16 GPa. We report the pressure dependence {{of all the}} Raman-active first-order phonons of the tetragonal scheelite phase (BaWO 4 -I, space group I 41 /a), which is stable at normal conditions. As pressure increases the Raman spectrum undergoes significant changes around 6. 9 GPa due to {{the onset of the}} structural phase transition to the monoclinic BaWO 4 -II phase (space group P 21 /n). This transition is only completed above 9. 5 GPa. A further change in the spectrum is observed at 7. 5 GPa related to a scheelite-to-fergusonite transition. The scheelite, BaWO 4 -II, and fergusonite phases coexist up to 9. 0 GPa due to the sluggishness of the I?II phase transition. Further to the experimental study, we have performed ab initio lattice dynamics calculations that have greatly helped us in assigning and discussing the pressure behaviour of the observed Raman modes of the three phases.

40|$|The {{production}} of nucleogenic neon from alpha particle capture by ^(18) O and ^(19) F offers a potential chronometer sensitive to temperatures {{higher than the}} more widely used (U-Th) /He chronometer. The accuracy depends on the cross sections and the calculated stopping power for alpha particles in the mineral being studied. Published ^(18) O(α,n) ^(21) Ne production rates are in poor agreement and were calculated from contradictory cross sections, and therefore demand experimental verification. Similarly, the stopping powers for alpha particles are calculated from SRIM (Stopping Range of Ions in Matter software) based on a limited experimental dataset. To address these issues we used a particle accelerator to implant alpha particles at precisely known energies into slabs of synthetic quartz (SiO_ 2) and <b>barium</b> <b>tungstate</b> (BaWO_ 4) to measure ^(21) Ne production from capture by ^(18) O. Within experimental uncertainties the observed ^(21) Ne production rates compare favorably to our predictions using published cross sections and stopping powers, indicating that ages calculated using these quantities are accurate at the ∼ 3 % level. In addition, we measured the ^(22) Ne/^(21) Ne ratio and (U-Th) /He and (U-Th) /Ne ages of Durango fluorapatite, which is an important model system for this work because it contains both oxygen and fluorine.
