5|$|Eowa {{was killed}} at Maserfield along with Oswald, {{although}} on which side he fought is unknown. It may well <b>be</b> <b>that</b> he fought as a dependent ally of Oswald against Penda. If Eowa {{was in fact}} dominant among the Mercians during the period {{leading up to the}} battle, then his death could have marked what the author of the Historia Brittonum regarded as the beginning of Penda's ten-year reign. Thus it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Penda prevailed not only over the Northumbrians but also over his rivals among the Mercians.|$|E

It may also <b>be</b> <b>that</b> {{in the mind}} of their chief {{terrorist}} and propagandist, anarchist veteran...and Situational artist McLaren, the Sex Pistols were meant to be a force that would set the world on its ear...and finally unite music and politics. The Sex Pistols were all of these things.|$|E

5|$|Vertebral artery {{dissection}} {{has also}} been reported in association with some forms of neck manipulation. There is significant controversy {{about the level of}} risk of stroke from neck manipulation. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> manipulation can cause dissection, or it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the dissection is already present in some people who seek manipulative treatment. At this time, conclusive evidence does not exist to support either a strong association between neck manipulation and stroke, or no association.|$|E
5|$|A {{central part}} of the show's premise was that the main {{character}} would be handicapped. The initial idea was for House to use a wheelchair, but Fox turned down this interpretation (for which the crew was later grateful). The wheelchair idea turned into a scar on House's face, which later turned into a bad leg necessitating use of a cane. The original script called for House to be 34 years old; however, Shore later explained {{that he did not want}} the character to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> young.|$|E
5|$|A {{conceptual}} design for another lake lander was proposed in late 2012 by the Spanish-based private engineering firm SENER and the Centro de Astrobiología in Madrid. The concept probe is called Titan Lake In-situ Sampling Propelled Explorer (TALISE). The major difference {{compared to the}} TiME probe would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> TALISE is envisioned with its own propulsion system and would therefore {{not be limited to}} simply drifting on the lake when it splashes down.|$|E

5|$|A more {{indirect}} effect would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the contracted s and p1/2 orbitals shield (take on themselves) {{the charge of}} the nucleus more effectively, leaving even less for the outer d and f electrons, which therefore move on larger orbitals. Dubnium is greatly affected by this: unlike the previous group 5 members, its 7s electrons {{are more difficult to}} extract from an atom than the 6d electrons, though these energy levels remain close to each other.|$|E
5|$|A {{possible}} {{reason for the}} willingness of the Franks to connect themselves with the Kentish court is the fact that a Frankish king, Chilperic I, is recorded as having conquered a people known as the Euthiones during the mid-sixth century. If, as seems likely from the name, these people were the continental remnants of the Jutish invaders of Kent, then it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the marriage was intended as a unifying political move, reconnecting different branches of the same people. Another perspective on the marriage may be gained by considering that it is likely that Æthelberht was not yet king at the time he and Bertha were wed: it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Frankish support for him, acquired via the marriage, was instrumental in gaining the throne for him.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historian}} Paolo Delogu it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Agnellus' narrative better reflects Lombard {{oral tradition}} than Paul's. In his interpretation, Paul's narrative represents a late {{distortion of the}} Germanic myths and rituals contained in the oral tradition. In a telling consistent with Germanic tradition, it would be Helmichis who was seduced by the queen, and by sleeping with him Rosamund would pass Alboin's royal charisma magically to the king's prospective murderer. A symbol of this passage of powers is found in Paul's account of the assassin's entry: Alboin's inability to draw his sword represents here his loss of power.|$|E

5|$|Aesthetics as {{a factor}} of well-being. From the early austere {{principle}} that form should strictly follow function, {{there is a growing}} sensibility that aesthetics affect the physical and emotional health of those who use a building or structure.

5|$|Although {{there is}} no {{well-established}} writing system for ASL, written sign language dates back almost two centuries. The first systematic writing system for a sign language seems to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> of Roch-Ambroise Auguste Bébian, developed in 1825. However, written sign language remained marginal among the public. In the 1960s, linguist William Stokoe created Stokoe notation specifically for ASL. It is alphabetic, with a letter or diacritic for every phonemic (distinctive) hand shape, orientation, motion, and position, though it lacks any representation of facial expression, and is better suited for individual words than for extended passages of text. Stokoe used this system for his 1965 A Dictionary of American Sign Language on Linguistic Principles.|$|E
5|$|An {{explanation}} {{put forward}} by the Russian Government appeared to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> the deaths of Litvinenko and Politkovskaya were intended to embarrass President Putin.

5|$|Another {{possibility}} {{was suggested}} by Brooks: Penda might have lost power {{at some point}} after Heavenfield, and Eowa may have actually been ruling the Mercians {{for at least some}} of the period as a subject ally or puppet of Oswald. Brooks cited Bede's statement implying that Penda's fortunes were mixed during his 22 years in power and noted the possibility that Penda's fortunes were low at this time. Thus it may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> Penda was not consistently the dominant figure in Mercia during the years between Hatfield and Maserfield. argues against the idea that Penda and Eowa were co-rulers, and favours the idea that Eowa was ruling Mercia from c. 635 until 642.|$|E

Taking into account the high costs and uncertainty incurred by the firm and the potential hazards for Rossier himself, this was an important commission.|$|E

5|$|Bardou-Jacquet {{wanted to}} compose the {{advertisement}} {{with as little}} computer-generated imagery as possible, believing that the final product would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> much more appealing to its audience. To this end, he set two months aside {{for the creation of}} hundreds of conceptual drawings detailing various possible interactions between the parts, and a further four months for practical testing and development. For the testing phase, the script was broken into small segments, each comprising only one or two interactions. Ideas deemed unworkable by the testing crew, such as airbag explosions and collisions between front and rear sections of the car, were abandoned, and the remaining segments were slowly brought together until the full and final sequence was developed.|$|E
5|$|Bede is {{somewhat}} reticent about {{the career of}} Wilfrid, a contemporary {{and one of the}} most prominent clerics of his day.
