Materials and Methods : Class V cavities were prepared on 45 extracted molars. The respective experimentalgroups were treated with cavity disinfectants and Clearfil SE Bond. Preparations without cavity disinfectants served as negative control and those with neither disinfectant nor dentin bonding resin application served as positive controls. After the cavity preparations were restored with resin composite (Clearfil APX), the specimens were subjected to dye penetration. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA (Kruskal-Wallis) test.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{evaluate}} <b>the</b> push-out <b>bond</b> {{strength and}} <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> ability of five adhesive cements routinely used for fiber-post bonding. METHODS: Fifty extracted single-rooted teeth were randomly divided in five groups and restored using Parapost FiberLux {{and the following}} luting agents: Panavia 21 (PAN), Clearfil Esthetic Cement (CLF), Variolink II (VAR), RelyX Unicem (UNI) and experimental GC self-adhesive cement (EGC). After 1 week of water storage at 37 degrees C, three sections (coronal, middle and apical) of 2 mm thickness were prepared from each specimen.

On both the STS- 1 and STS- 2 flights this gap was discovered to vary anywhere from an intended gap of 0. 375 in. to an actual measured gap of 0. 60 in. due to tolerances. Tests were conducted with and without a 0. 25 in. thick cork shim placed under <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> with a 0. 60 in. gap under the phenolic TPS to determine and compare the performance of <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> in <b>the</b> two different configurations. To alleviate the difficult and costly procedure of installing the cork shim under <b>the</b> <b>seal,</b> especially after phenolic TPS mounting on the attach ring, large fishtail seals of idential Elder gray silicon material and two different hardnesses were tested. A similar matrix of tests was conducted with this new large fishtail seal, and seals with both type hardnesses performed well {{regardless of whether or}} not <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> was <b>bonded</b> in <b>the</b> phenolic at the front of <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> groove. Similar results had been obtained with the original small fishtail seal which performed adequately with the 0. 25 in. cork shim under it...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>bonding</b> between <b>the</b> {{glass or}} {{ceramics}} {{and the glass}} solder can be either covalent, or, more often, van der Waals. <b>The</b> <b>seal</b> can be leak-tight; glass soldering is frequently used in vacuum technology. Glass solders can be also used as sealants; a vitreous enamel coating on iron lowered its permeability to hydrogen 10 times. Glass solders are frequently used for glass-to-metal seals and glass-ceramic-to-metal seals.|$|R
5000|$|A Flexplay disc is {{shipped in}} a vacuum-sealed package. There {{is a clear}} dye inside the disc, {{contained}} within <b>the</b> <b>bonding</b> resin of <b>the</b> disc, which reacts with oxygen. When <b>the</b> <b>seal</b> is broken on the vacuum-packed disc, the layer changes from clear to black in about 48 hours, rendering the disc unplayable. If unopened, the shelf life of <b>the</b> <b>sealed</b> package {{is said to be}} [...] "about a year". The DVD plastic also has a red dye in it, which prevents penetration of the disc by blue lasers, which would go straight through the oxygen-reactive dye.|$|R
40|$|The work {{to correct}} several design {{deficiencies}} {{present in the}} bearings used in the orbital extravehicular spacesuit is reported. These deficiencies included: difficult stitch-on interface between fabric and outer race; a tendency for the clamping threads to seize; and, most importantly, the failure of <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> surfaces (Teflon seat, Delrin seal) to maintain integrity with cycling. The first problem was corrected by raising the stitch-on holes {{so as to be}} more accessible. The seizing was eliminated by changing to a coarser thread, from 32 /inch to 24 /inch. The solution to <b>the</b> <b>sealing</b> problem required a materials evaluation, candidate material selection, and adhesive evaluation (for <b>bonding</b> <b>the</b> seat material to the outer race) and bench-cycling of candidate seal/seat combinations. The final configuration, successfully bench-cycled and delivered to NASA, is shown...|$|R
