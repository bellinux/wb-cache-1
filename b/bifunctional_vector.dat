40|$|Streptomyces fradiae JS 6 (mcr- 6) is a mutant {{which is}} {{defective}} in repair of DNA damage induced {{by a variety}} of chemical mutagens and UV light. JS 6 is also defective in error-prone (mutagenic) DNA repair (J. Stonesifer and R. H. Baltz, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82 : 1180 - 1183, 1985). The recA gene of Escherichia coli, cloned in a <b>bifunctional</b> <b>vector</b> that replicates in E. coli and Streptomyces spp., complemented the mutation in S. fradiae JS 6, indicating that E. coli and S. fradiae express similar SOS responses and that the mcr+ gene product of S. fradiae is functionally analogous to the protein encoded by the recA gene of E. coli...|$|E
40|$|From a {{clone bank}} of the entire genome of Bacillus thuringiensis, one clone that {{contains}} a plasmid (pBT 15 - 88) harboring a sporulation gene was identified by molecular hybridization. This gene, identified as the crystal protein gene, occurs both on a large host plasmid DNA and in the chromosomal DNA in B. thuringiensis strain berliner 1715. The inserted sequence of pBT 15 - 88, which corresponds to the chromosomal sequence, was not expressed in Escherichia coli. In B. thuringiensis (kurstaki), the crystal gene was found only on a large host plasmid while in B. thuringiensis (dendrolimus), it is only on the chromosomal DNA. The plasmid crystal gene was cloned by ligation of a 14 -kb BamHI fragment of a host plasmid DNA of 42 megadaltons from strain berliner 1715 into the BamHI site of the <b>bifunctional</b> <b>vector</b> pHV 33. In E. coli and in sporulating B. subtilis the plasmid pBT 42 - 1 coded for a polypeptide, detected by antibodies against the crystal protein, with the same electrophoretic mobility as the crystal protein of B. thuringiensis. The crystal gene was not expressed in vegetative cells of B. subtilis, suggesting that the control {{at the transcriptional level}} is the same in B. subtilis and in B. thuringiensis. Protein extracts from the clones harboring the hybrid plasmid are toxic for the larvae of Pierris brassicae and the protein antigen forms cytoplasmic inclusion bodies in E. coli and B. subtilis, which are visible under the light microscope...|$|E
40|$|The {{chromosomal}} beta-lactamase (penicillinase, penP) gene from Bacillus licheniformis 749 /C {{has been}} cloned in Escherichia coli. The {{locations of the}} target sites for various restriction enzymes on the 4. 2 -kilobase EcoRI fragment were determined. By matching the restriction mapping data with the potential nucleotide sequences of the penP gene deduced from known protein sequence, we established the exact position of the penP gene on the fragment. A <b>bifunctional</b> plasmid <b>vector</b> carrying the penP gene, plasmid pOG 2165, was constructed which directs the synthesis of the heterologous beta-lactamase in both E. coli and Bacillus subtilis hosts. The protein synthesized in E. coli and B. subtilis is similar in size to the processed beta-lactamase made in B. licheniformis. Furthermore, the beta-lactamase made in B. subtilis is efficiently secreted by the host into the culture medium, indicating that B. subtilis is capable of carrying out the post-translational proteolytic cleavage(s) to convert the membrane-bound precursor enzyme into the soluble extracellular form...|$|R
40|$|The genes {{involved}} in gluconate catabolism (gntP and gntK) in Corynebacterium glutamicum are scattered in the chromosome, and no regulatory genes are apparently associated with them, {{in contrast with}} the organization of the gnt operon in Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. In C. glutamicum, gntP and gntK are essential genes when gluconate is the only carbon and energy source. Both genes contain upstream regulatory regions consisting of a typical promoter and a hypothetical cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP) binding region but lack the expected consensus operator region for binding of the GntR repressor protein. Expression analysis by Northern blotting showed monocistronic transcripts for both genes. The expression of gntP and gntK is not induced by gluconate, and the gnt genes are subject to catabolite repression by sugars, such as glucose, fructose, and sucrose, as was detected by quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Specific analysis of the DNA promoter sequences (PgntK and PgntP) was performed using <b>bifunctional</b> promoter probe <b>vectors</b> containing mel ({{involved in}} melanin production) or egfp 2 (encoding a green fluorescent protein derivative) as the reporter gene. Using this approach, we obtained results parallel to those from qRT-PCR. An applied example of in vivo gene expression modulation of the divIVA gene in C. glutamicum is shown, corroborating the possible use of the gnt promoters to control gene expression. glxR (which encodes GlxR, the hypothetical CRP protein) was subcloned from the C. glutamicum chromosomal DNA and overexpressed in corynebacteria; we found that the level of gnt expression was slightly decreased compared to that of the control strains. The purified GlxR protein was used in gel shift mobility assays, and a specific interaction of GlxR with sequences present on PgntP and PgntK fragments was detected only in the presence of cAMP...|$|R
