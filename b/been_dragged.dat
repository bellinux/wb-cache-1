5|$|As {{with his}} {{previous}} novels, Fleming used events {{from his past}} as elements in his novel. Whilst at Kitzbühel in the 1930s, Fleming's car, a Standard Tourer, had been struck by a train at a level crossing and he had <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> fifty yards down the track. From that time on he had associated trains with death, which led to their use as a plot device not just in The Man with the Golden Gun, but also in Diamonds Are Forever and From Russia, with Love.|$|E

5|$|A service ramp at {{the rear}} of the {{basement}} led to a sliding door that opened into an alley; the police found the door had been tampered with so it could be opened without unlocking it.

Some evidence at the crime scene was improperly handled by the police investigators: a trail in the dirt (from the elevator shaft) along which police believed Phagan had <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> was trampled; the footprints were never identified.|$|E
5|$|Many half-tracks, jeeps {{and trucks}} foundered in deep water; those {{that made it}} ashore soon became jammed up on the {{narrowing}} beach, making easy targets for the German defenders. Most of the radios were lost, making the task of organizing the scattered and dispirited troops even more difficult, and those command groups that did make the shore found their effectiveness limited to their immediate vicinity. Except for a few surviving tanks and a heavy weapons squad here or there, the assault troops had only their personal weapons, which, having <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> through surf and sand, invariably needed cleaning before they could be used.|$|E

5|$|Geoffrey was consecrated on 18 August 1191, at Tours in France, by Bartholomew, the Archbishop of Tours, {{after the}} papacy {{agreed to allow}} the consecration. This {{permission}} was secured by {{the intervention of the}} king and his mother, Eleanor of Aquitaine. Turner and Heiser see the presumed motivation behind Eleanor and Richard's support {{as part of an effort}} to secure a counter-weight to the power exercised in England by the Chancellor, William Longchamp, about whom complaints had reached Richard in Sicily. Geoffrey received his pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, at his consecration. In September 1191, after the consecration, he attempted to go to York, but was met at Dover by agents of Longchamp, and even though he took refuge in the priory of St. Martin in Dover, was dragged from sanctuary and imprisoned in Dover Castle. Longchamp claimed that Geoffrey had not sworn fealty to Richard, but this was probably just an excuse to eliminate a rival. Another complication was that the English bishops had appealed to the papacy because Geoffrey had not been consecrated by the Archbishop of Canterbury, and Longchamp could therefore claim to have been acting on behalf of the other bishops in ordering Geoffrey's arrest. But the actions of Longchamp's agents were considered excessive and there was soon an outcry against the Chancellor's arrest of Geoffrey, even though Longchamp claimed that his orders had been exceeded by his agents. One cause of the outrage was the obvious parallel with the murder of Thomas Becket, who had <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> from an altar and martyred. The archbishop was released and took part in a council held at Loddon Bridge, between Reading and Windsor; Longchamp was excommunicated and deposed from the chancellorship, and Hugh of Lincoln, the Bishop of Lincoln, excommunicated those who had dragged Geoffrey from sanctuary. Geoffrey was then enthroned at York on 1 November 1191.|$|E

25|$|According to Norris, {{the level}} of {{brutality}} Bittaker had exhibited towards their victims had increased on each successive instance they had successfully lured a girl into the van: their final victim, Shirley Ledford, had actually pleaded to be killed in order that her agony could cease. Additional details provided by Norris provided further corroborating evidence to support his confessions. For example, he knew that their first victim, Lucinda Schaefer, had left a meeting at a Presbyterian Church shortly before she was abducted, and that Schaefer had lost one shoe as she had <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> into Bittaker's van. Norris also knew part of Shirley Ledford's ancestry was Hispanic, and that Bittaker had unsuccessfully asked her to date him prior to October 1979.|$|E
25|$|Dora Bloch, a 74-year-old Israeli {{who also}} held British citizenship, {{was taken to}} Mulago Hospital in Kampala after choking on a chicken bone. After the raid she was murdered by {{officers}} of the Ugandan army, as were some of her doctors and nurses, apparently for trying to intervene. In April 1987, Henry Kyemba, Uganda's Attorney general and Minister of Justice at the time, told the Uganda Human Rights Commission that Bloch had <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> from her hospital bed and killed by two army officers on Amin's orders. Bloch was shot and her body was dumped {{in the trunk of}} a car that had Ugandan intelligence services number plates. Her remains were recovered near a sugar plantation 20miles (32km) east of Kampala in 1979, after the Ugandan–Tanzanian War ended Amin's rule. Amin also ordered the killing of hundreds of Kenyans living in Uganda in retaliation for Kenya's assistance to Israel in the raid.|$|E

25|$|A Redondo Beach Detective named Paul Bynum was {{assigned}} to investigate Dalton's claims as to Norris's confessions of the murders, attempted abductions, and rapes which he had confided to Dalton had occurred between June and October. Bynum initially noted that Dalton's statements as to Norris's confessions did match reports on file of several teenage girls who had been reported missing over the previous five months. In addition, the incident Norris had confided to Dalton where he claimed he and Bittaker had sprayed mace {{in the face of}} a woman, who had then <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> into Bittaker's GMC van and raped by both men, matched a report filed in relation to an incident which occurred on September 30. In this filed report, a young woman named Robin Robeck had had mace sprayed in her face before being dragged into a van and raped by two Caucasian men in their mid-30s, before being released. Although Robeck had reported the abduction and rape to police, they had been unable to identify her assailants.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, on {{the other}} side, General Branch had put his regiments into the line. From his left, at Fort Thompson, to the brickyard on his right, were the 27th, 37th, 7th, and 35th North Carolina regiments. His reserve was the 33rd Regiment. The right flank of the 35th was {{anchored}} in a brickyard kiln that was loopholed for artillery. The entire line beyond the railroad was occupied by a single regiment, the 26th North Carolina, plus a few companies of cavalry. The gap in his line created by the dogleg at the railroad was covered only by his weakest unit, a militia battalion with only two weeks of training, and armed with shotguns and hunting rifles. To give them additional support, he ordered up a two-gun battery of 24-pounders to the kiln, {{but they were not}} mounted when they came under attack. The First Brigade of the Union Army opposed them from the river to the railroad; right to left, the units were the 25th, 24th, 27th, and 23rd Massachusetts, and the 10th Connecticut. The Beaufort Road ran through the center of this line, and here General Foster placed the howitzers that had <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> along.|$|E
25|$|The {{mutilated}} {{bodies of}} Wilson and Andrews were {{discovered by the}} security forces at 4. They were lying in pools of blood {{on either side of}} Wilson's Mini at a quarry off the Hightown Road near Cavehill as described by the UFF caller. The Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and British Army had proceeded carefully to the quarry in case the bodies had been booby-trapped. Wilson had been stabbed to death 30 times and his throat sliced from ear-to-ear. There was evidence that he had put up a struggle before he was killed. Andrews had received 20 knife wounds. A UFF Brigade Staff member described the killings to a journalist as ritualistic; in addition to the multiple stabbings, Irene Andrews also had her breasts hacked off. The killings took place at the quarry and it was suggested by police that Wilson's Mini had been stopped on the road leading to Ballysillan and they were forced at gunpoint to drive out to the quarry. According to Martin Dillon forensic evidence indicated that Wilson had <b>been</b> <b>dragged</b> from the car and pinned to the ground where he was stabbed and Andrews was killed afterwards. Dillon speculated that the killers had made Andrews watch Wilson being killed.|$|E
