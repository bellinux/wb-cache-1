25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1870, Crazy Horse invited <b>Black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Woman to {{accompany}} him on a buffalo hunt in the Slim Buttes area of present-day northwestern South Dakota. She was the wife of No Water, who {{had a reputation for}} drinking too much. It was Lakota custom to allow a woman to divorce her husband at any time. She did so by moving in with relatives or with another man, or by placing the husband's belongings outside their lodge. Although some compensation might be required to smooth over hurt feelings, the rejected husband was expected to accept his wife's decision. No Water was away from camp when Crazy Horse and <b>Black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Woman left for the buffalo hunt.|$|E
25|$|Rattling Blanket Woman was the {{daughter}} of <b>Black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> and White Cow (also known as Iron Cane). Her older siblings were Lone Horn (born 1790, died 1877) and Good Looking Woman (born 1810). Her younger sister was named Looks At It (born 1815), later given the name They Are Afraid of Her. The historian George Hyde wrote that Rattling Blanket Woman was Miniconjou and the sister of Spotted Tail, who became a Brulé head chief.|$|E
25|$|No Water {{tracked down}} Crazy Horse and <b>Black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Woman in the Slim Buttes area. When {{he found them}} in a teepee, he called Crazy Horse's name from outside. When Crazy Horse answered, No Water stuck a pistol into the teepee and aimed for Crazy Horse. Touch the Clouds, Crazy Horse's first cousin and son of Lone Horn, {{was sitting in the}} teepee nearest the entry. He knocked the pistol upward as No Water fired, {{deflecting}} the bullet to Crazy Horse's upper jaw. No Water left, with Crazy Horse's relatives in hot pursuit. No Water ran his horse until it died and continued on foot until he reached the safety of his own village.|$|E

2500|$|According to Frederick Hoxie's Encyclopedia of North American Indians, Crazy Horse was {{the third}} in his male line to bear the name of Crazy Horse, which in Lakota is Tȟašúŋke Witkó. Tȟašúŋke Witkó III (1840–1877) {{was the son of}} Rattling Blanket Woman and Tȟašúŋke Witkó II. The love of his life was <b>Black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Woman, whom he courted, but she married another man named No Water. At one point, Crazy Horse persuaded <b>Black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Woman to run away with him. No Water {{borrowed}} a pistol and ran after his wife. When he found her with Crazy Horse, he fired at him, injuring him in the face and leaving a noticeable scar. Crazy Horse was married two times, first to Black Shawl and second to Nellie Larrabee (Laravie). Nellie Larrabee was given the task of spying on Crazy Horse for the military, so the [...] "marriage" [...] is suspect. Only Black Shawl bore him any children, a daughter named They Are Afraid of Her, who died at age three.|$|E

50|$|Having {{defeated}} most of {{the other}} kings, Lalitaditya proceeded from Avanti to Uttarapatha (the northern region), where he fought with several mighty kings. His army emptied the Kamboja stables of horses (a reference to the Kamboja country's reputation for good-quality horses). The resulting darkness made them appear as if they were filled with <b>black</b> <b>buffaloes</b> instead. The Tuhkharas fled to mountain ranges on Lalitaditya's approach, leaving behind their horses. He also defeated Mummuni three times in a battle, and made the Bhauttas very anxious. Lalitaditya was too dignified to tolerate the wine-drinking Daradas.|$|R

Originally, outfield distances were 344 ft to left field, 430 ft to center field, and 344 ft to right field and capacity accommodated 12,000. In 1938, outfield dimensions were slightly modified to 345 ft to left, 440 ft to center, and 325 ft to right while capacity increased to 14,000. The heights of outfield fences varied: left and right field fences were 12 ft high, left-center scoreboard was 24 ft high, and the center field fence was 18 ft high.|$|R
2500|$|Colonel William Rufus Shafter assumed command at Fort Davis in March 1881. He {{had been}} the {{commander}} of the First Infantry Regiment at Fort Davis. Shafter had a reputation as harassing officers he disliked. While he tolerated <b>black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> Soldiers, he hated seeing a black officer. Flipper was dismissed without cause as quartermaster within days. Then Shafter [...] "asked" [...] Flipper to keep the quartermaster's safe in his quarters. Being [...] "asked" [...] by a superior officer was a de facto order and Flipper complied. In July 1881, Flipper found a shortage of over $2,000.00. Realizing this could be used against him by officers intent on forcing him out of the army, he attempted to hide the discrepancy, which was later discovered, then he lied about it when confronted. In August, he was arrested by Shafter for embezzling government funds. Word quickly spread about the missing money. Many felt it was a setup and soldiers and the community came up with the money to replace what was missing within four days. Shafter accepted the money, then convened a court martial on September 17, 1881.|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the primary}} {{objectives}} of the expedition as directed by President Jefferson was to observe and record the whereabouts, lives, activities, and cultures of the various American Indian tribes that inhabited the newly acquired territory and the northwest in general. The expedition encountered many different tribes along the way, many of whom offered their assistance, providing the expedition with {{their knowledge of the}} wilderness and with the acquisition of food. Along with the standard provisions of weapons, powder, tools, and cooking utensils, the expedition also had blank leather-bound journals and ink for the purpose of recording such encounters, as well as for scientific and geological information. They were also provided with various gifts of medals, ribbons, needles, mirrors and other artifacts which were intended to ease any tensions when negotiating their passage with the various Indian chiefs they would encounter along their way. As many of the tribes had had previous friendly experiences with British and French fur traders in various isolated encounters along the Missouri and Columbia Rivers, the expedition subsequently did not encounter any hostilities {{with the exception of the}} Teton-Sioux tribe under <b>Black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> [...] and the Partisan tribe on September 25, 1804. Both of these tribes were rivals and hoped to use the expedition to their own advantage and who both demanded tribute from the expedition for their passage over the river at that particular juncture. Captain Lewis made his first mistake by offering the Sioux chief gifts first, which insulted and angered the Partisan chief. Communication was difficult since the expedition's only Sioux interpreter, Pierre Dorion, had stayed behind with the other party and was also involved with diplomatic affairs with another tribe. Consequently, both chiefs were offered a few gifts, but neither was satisfied. At that point, some of the warriors from the Partisan tribe then took hold of their boat and one of the oars. Lewis took a firm stand, ordering a display of force, presenting arms; Captain Clark, by gesture of brandishing his sword, threatened violent reprisal. Just before the situation erupted into a violent confrontation, <b>Black</b> <b>Buffalo</b> ordered his warriors to back off. After the ensuing diplomacy and with the aid of better gifts and now a bottle of whiskey, of which some was consumed, the captains were able to negotiate their passage through without further incident. During the next two days, the expedition made camp not far from Black Buffalo's tribe. When they attempted to leave, other similar incidents occurred, but they were averted with still more gifts, this time, of tobacco.|$|E
60|$|I was {{particularly}} pleased and tickled, with {{a multitude of}} little salt-droghers, rigged like sloops, and {{not much bigger than}} a pilot- boat, but with broad bows painted black, and carrying red sails, which looked {{as if they had been}} pickled and stained in a tan-yard. These little fellows were continually coming in with their cargoes for ships bound to America; and lying, five or six together, alongside of those lofty Yankee hulls, resembled a parcel of red ants about the carcass of a <b>black</b> <b>buffalo.</b>|$|E

Not fifty yards away was a great, shaggy, <b>black</b> <b>buffalo.</b> He was the king of the herd; but ill at ease, for he pawed the grass and shook his huge head.
