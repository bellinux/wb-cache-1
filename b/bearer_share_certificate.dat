5000|$|Stock {{certificate}} Before the use {{of electronic}} technology, all shares were held in certificated form, either as registered shares (where the company maintains a register of owners of shares as well as issuing share certificates) and changes of ownership are registered, or as bearer shares http://www.six-swiss-exchange.com/knowhow/products/shares/types/bearer_en.html where ownership was transferred simply by handing the <b>bearer</b> <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> to the new owner.|$|E
5000|$|The SPI {{is divided}} into sectors {{on the basis of}} {{economic}} activity. This classification is based on the International Classification Benchmark ICB from Dow Jones and FTSE, which simplifies international performance comparisons significantly. Two other classification systems are used as well: classification based on market capitalisation (small, middle, large) and security category (registered <b>shares,</b> <b>bearer</b> <b>share,</b> participation <b>certificates).</b>|$|R
50|$|On 14 November 2016, Sharif lawyer Sheikh {{dramatically}} {{produced a}} letter written by Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the Prime Minister of Qatar from 2007 to 2013. The letter, marked private and confidential, read: (My father Jassim) had longstanding business relations with (Sharif's father) Mian Mohammad Sharif which were coordinated through my eldest brother... Mian Sharif expressed his desire to invest {{a certain amount of}} money in the real estate business of Al Thani family in Qatar. I understood at that time, that an aggregate sum of around Dirhams 12 million was contributed by Mian Sharif, originating from the sale of business in Dubai (for four flats: 16, 16A, 17 and 17A Avenfield House, Park Lane, London, registered under the ownership of two offshore companies, while their <b>bearer</b> <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> were kept in Qatar). These were purchased from the proceeds of the real estate business... I can recall that during his lifetime, Mian Sharif wished that the beneficiary of his investment and returns in the real estate business be his grandson Hussain Nawaz Sharif.|$|R
5000|$|In 1995, {{the shares}} were {{consolidated}} at {{a ratio of}} 125 to 1. At that time, 5 <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> were worth [...]008 (or 0.8%) of one post-consolidation share. In June 1997, the consolidated shares were subject to a compulsory buy-out at $70 each (i.e. 56 cents per <b>bearer</b> <b>share)</b> as part of a privatization transaction by the Jim Pattison Group. However, the buyout had a 10 year limit which expired on June 30, 2007 and, as a result, outstanding <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> no longer have any value.|$|R
5000|$|Cayman Islands {{companies}} may issue <b>bearer</b> <b>shares,</b> {{but only to}} a custodian. [...] There are no equivalent restrictions {{on the power of}} companies to issue bearer debt securities or <b>bearer</b> <b>share</b> warrants.|$|R
500|$|The OECD report {{concludes that}} the use of <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> is [...] "perhaps the single most {{important}} (and perhaps the most widely used) mechanism" [...] to protect the anonymity of a ship's beneficial owner. Physically possessing a <b>bearer</b> <b>share</b> accords ownership of the corporation. There is no requirement for reporting the transfer of <b>bearer</b> <b>shares,</b> and not every jurisdiction requires that their serial numbers even be recorded.|$|R
5000|$|British Virgin Islands {{companies}} still technically {{have the}} power to issue <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> where their constitutional documents so provide. However, <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> have become so circumscribed that they are rarely seen in practice. Companies which issue <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> are subject to punitive increased licence fees, and all <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> are required to be held by licensed custodians ("de-materialised" [...] in the parlance of the statute) and so operate {{in much the same way}} as registered shares in any event. Bearer shares which are not deposited with a licensed custodian are disabled by law, and cannot vote or receive distributions.|$|R
5000|$|International Business Companies {{may issue}} <b>bearer</b> <b>shares,</b> {{but they may}} only be held by a {{licensed}} custodian, who must maintain records of the beneficial owner of the share. [...] There are no equivalent restrictions {{on the power of}} companies to issue bearer debt securities or <b>bearer</b> <b>share</b> warrants.|$|R
40|$|Convocation of {{shareholders}} meeting {{is a sort}} of communication among shareholders and company determined by kinds of shares regulated in each national legal system. As a rule shareholders with registered shares are to be notified individually, while existence of <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> requires public announcement. Despite lack of <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> in domestic law, Serbian Company Act stipulates both techniques...|$|R

50|$|Certain {{corporate}} documents, {{for example}} <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> are often issued under the company seal (and some countries required that <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> be issued under the common seal). For example, in India a <b>share</b> <b>certificate</b> is given under the common seal {{of the company}} and each usage of common seal is documented in the statutory registry of the company.|$|R
50|$|Bearer shares {{allow for}} {{anonymous}} ownership, {{and thus have}} been criticized for facilitating money laundering and tax evasion; these shares are also available in some OECD countries {{as well as in the}} U.S. state of Wyoming. In a 2010 study in which the researcher attempted to set-up anonymous corporations found that 13 of the 17 attempts were successful in OECD countries, such as the United States and the United Kingdom, while only 4 of 28 attempts were successful in countries typically labeled tax havens. The last two states in America permitting <b>bearer</b> <b>shares,</b> Nevada and Delaware made them illegal in 2007. In 2011, an OECD peer review recommended that the United Kingdom improve its <b>bearer</b> <b>share</b> laws. The UK abolished the use of <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> in 2015.|$|R
50|$|Further, most jurisdictions {{have either}} {{eliminated}} or highly restricted the issuing of <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> by IBCs due to international pressures.|$|R
50|$|In Sweden, <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> {{have been}} largely abolished, people using {{electronic}} shares instead (which are either registered in the share owner's name or in the share owner's broker's name). <b>Share</b> <b>certificates</b> may exist in Sweden, {{but only if the}} shares are not listed on any stock exchange in Sweden, and the availability of <b>share</b> <b>certificates</b> {{has nothing to do with}} voting in shareholders' general meetings.|$|R

40|$|The recodification of {{commercial}} and civil law in the Czech Republic {{has resulted in a}} new concept for the legislation relating to securities. Significant changes have also been made to the legislation covering shares. The new legislation concerns not only the actual form of shares, but also their circulation. The aim {{of this article is to}} highlight the most important changes in the legislation relating to <b>bearer</b> <b>shares,</b> especially <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> in paper form, and to assess these changes from the viewpoint of their impact on the transparency of joint stock companies and uncontrolled circulation of shares. This assessment will be based on an appraisal of the importance of <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> for capital business in the Czech Republic and the effects the new legislation is expected to bring about. The article will also consider possible alternatives in the behavior of shareholders (investors) who prefer to remain anonymous...|$|R
5000|$|Like many Panamanian companies, Blairmore issued <b>bearer</b> <b>shares,</b> {{which are}} not listed on a share register; rather, like banknotes, they legally belong to the person holding the {{certificate}} in their hand. In recent years, <b>bearer</b> <b>shares</b> have been abolished in many countries due to concerns {{that they could be}} used by criminals and tax evaders for money laundering and because they conceal the beneficial ownership of the company and [...] However, there is no suggestion that Blairmore was using them for any illegal purpose, and they were common among offshore funds at the time.|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{shareholders}} {{could be}} literally anonymous and collect dividends by surrendering coupons {{attached to their}} <b>share</b> <b>certificates.</b> Dividends were therefore paid to whoever held the <b>certificate.</b> <b>Share</b> <b>certificates</b> could be transferred privately, and therefore {{the management of the}} company would not necessarily know who owned its shares.|$|R

5000|$|Two nominee {{directors}} from Sark {{were appointed}} to Feberion, {{and the company}} then issued two <b>bearer</b> <b>shares.</b> Parry used the offshore firms and recycled the funds, said to have amounted to £10.7 million, through transactions including land in London Docklands, some buildings that used to form part of Cheltenham Ladies’ College, a farmhouse in Kent for McAvoy's girlfriend Kathleen Meacock and a £400,000 home {{for himself and his}} family - Crockham House, near Chartwell, Kent.
