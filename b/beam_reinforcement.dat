If the top reinforcement area (A_s,top) exceeds the bottom reinforcement area (A_s,bot) at a beam-column joint, relatively larger flexural compression would be {{developed at the}} bottom beam ends in order to balance the greater flexural tension developed from the top beam bars at the same section. Thus, the compressive stress of the bottom beam bars at the joint face would be {{greater than that of}} the top beam bars at the opposite face.

Eventually the load suddenly dropped due to the diagonal tension failure after reaching the peak load. In case of the specimen SB 2, SB 3, and SB 4, the strength was maintained almost being constantly at the peak strength, and then the strength dropped abruptly due to the compression failure at the compression zone without critical shear cracks even though several inclined cracks occurred.

40|$|The exact {{effect that}} each of the basic shear design {{parameters}} exerts on the shear capacity of reinforced concrete (RC) <b>beams</b> without shear <b>reinforcement</b> (Vc) is still unclear. Previous research on this subject often yielded contradictory results, especially for reinforced high-strength concrete (HSC) beams.

This paper investigates the validity of such a practice. Data on 656 reinforced concrete beams were used to train an artificial neural network model to predict the shear capacity of reinforced concrete beams and evaluate the performance of several existing shear strength calculation procedures.

The included subassemblies were constructed at above one-third scale, and they all used conventional types of reinforcement anchorage. Adequate joint confinement was found to be maintained when the provided amount of joint transverse reinforcement was equal to or above a certain limit. Possible influence parameters on the maximum response (in terms of both stress and strain, and thus also average stiffness) of RC joint shear behavior are first introduced. Then, RC joint shear strength and deformation models, which are applicable across diverse types of RC beam-column connections, are suggested by employing a Bayesian parameter estimation method.
