This version makes the East End conterminous with the Tower Division of Middlesex under the borders that area had in the 19th century when the East End completed the process of urbanisation.|$|E

5|$|At the Norman Conquest, the {{settlement}} of Wigan {{was part of the}} larger parish of Wigan which, the majority of which was within the hundred of Newton. On 26 August 1246, Wigan was granted a Royal Charter, making the town a free <b>borough.</b> This happened after Salford was granted its Charter in 1230 and before Manchester in 1301. As a <b>borough,</b> Wigan was represented in the Model Parliament from 1295–1306 by two burgesses– freemen of the <b>borough.</b> The Charter allowed taxes to be made on transactions made in the <b>borough</b> by tradesmen and permitted the local burgesses to establish a guild that would regulate trade in the <b>borough.</b> Non-members of the guild were not allowed to do business in the <b>borough</b> without permission from the burgesses. It is thought that when the Charter was reconfirmation in 1350 it was changed, allowing the election of a mayor of Wigan for the first time. Three burgesses were elected to be presented to the lord of the manor who would choose one man to be mayor for a year.|$|E
5|$|Bath {{had long}} been an ancient <b>borough,</b> having that status since 878 when it became a royal <b>borough</b> (burh) of Alfred the Great, and was {{reformed}} into a municipal <b>borough</b> in 1835. It has formed {{part of the county}} of Somerset since 878, when ceded to Wessex, having previously been in Mercia (the River Avon had acted as the border between the two kingdoms since 628). However, Bath was made a county <b>borough</b> in 1889, independent of the newly created administrative county and Somerset County Council. Bath became part of Avon when the non-metropolitan county was created in 1974, resulting in its abolition as a county <b>borough,</b> and instead became a non-metropolitan district with <b>borough</b> status. With the abolition of Avon in 1996, the non-metropolitan district and <b>borough</b> were abolished too, and Bath has since been part of the unitary authority district of Bath and North East Somerset (B). Bath was returned to the ceremonial county of Somerset in 1996, though as B is a unitary authority, it {{is not part of the}} area covered by Somerset County Council.|$|E

5|$|Depending on the {{definition}} adopted, neither the town nor the urban area are necessarily coterminous with the <b>borough.</b> Historically, {{the town of}} Reading was smaller than the <b>borough.</b> Definitions include the old ecclesiastical parishes of the churches of St Mary, St Laurence and St Giles, or the even smaller pre-19th century <b>borough.</b> Today, {{as well as the}} town centre Reading comprises a number of suburbs and other districts, both within the <b>borough</b> itself and within the surrounding urban area.
