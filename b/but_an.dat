5|$|As Hurricane Maria {{moved to}} the {{northeast}} the official forecasts called for the storm to continue to weaken slowly <b>but</b> <b>an</b> interaction with an upper-level trough caused Maria to strengthen again. It was also predicted that the storm would rapidly become extratropical, but Maria retained tropical characteristics for 48hours longer than some forecasts indicated. Maria weakened into a tropical storm on September 9 before finally becoming extratropical about midway between the Azores and Newfoundland early on September 10.|$|E

At approximately 10:15pm, Scott and Rataczak landed the 727, with the aft airstair still deployed, at Reno Airport.
