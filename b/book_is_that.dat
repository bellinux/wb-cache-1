5|$|D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson's {{most famous}} work, On Growth and Form {{was written in}} Dundee, mostly in 1915, but {{publication}} was put off until 1917 because of the delays of wartime and Thompson's many late alterations to the text. The central theme of the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> biologists of its author's day overemphasized evolution as the fundamental determinant of the form and structure of living organisms, and underemphasized the roles of physical laws and mechanics. At a time when vitalism was still being considered as a biological theory, he advocated structuralism {{as an alternative to}} natural selection in governing the form of species, with the smallest hint of vitalism as the unseen driving force.|$|E
25|$|Another {{and related}} theme {{is that of}} prophecy. The main point of the prophetic stories is that God's prophecies are always {{fulfilled}}, so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future. The implication, the release of Jehoiachin and his restoration {{to a place of}} honour in Babylon in the closing scenes of the <b>book,</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the promise of an eternal Davidic dynasty is still in effect, and that the Davidic line will be restored.|$|E
25|$|Daniel 1 {{serves as}} an {{introduction}} to the book, showing how God continues to move throughout history when men seem to have failed (i.e., how God stands for his people when they are in a foreign land and subject to an alien power). An interesting feature of the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the accounts of chapters 2-6 and the visions in chapter 7 are in Aramaic (after the first few lines of chapter 2 in Hebrew). However, the visions of chapters 8-12 are in Hebrew, as is the introduction, chapter 1.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the core}} ideas in his <b>books</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> {{possible}} to change other people's behavior by changing one's behavior toward them.|$|R
25|$|The {{book was}} first {{published}} on June1, 2003 in the US as a hardcover. Since then, Fire and Ice has been released in paperback and e-book format in other languages. The main theme of the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{the type of person}} one is inside {{is more important than the}} way one seems from the outside. The book received mixed reviews: the negative reviews criticized the flat characters, and how troublesome it was to flip back to the characters list due to the large number of cats; positive reviews praised the suspense and rising tensions in the book.|$|E
25|$|The {{thesis of}} this <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cities {{are the primary}} drivers of {{economic}} development. Her main argument is that explosive economic growth derives from urban import replacement. Import replacement occurs when a city begins to produce goods locally that it formerly imported, e.g., Tokyo bicycle factories replacing Tokyo bicycle importers in the 1800s. Jacobs claims that import replacement builds up local infrastructure, skills, and production. Jacobs also claims that the increased production is subsequently exported to other cities, giving those other cities a new opportunity to engage in import replacement, thus producing a positive cycle of growth.|$|E
25|$|One {{interpretation}} of the Domesday <b>Book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{by this time the}} native Cornish landowning class had been almost completely dispossessed and replaced by English landowners, particularly Harold Godwinson himself. However, the Bodmin manumissions show that two leading Cornish figures nominally had Saxon names, but these were both glossed with native Cornish names. Naming evidence cited by medievalist Edith Ditmas suggests that many post-Conquest landowners in Cornwall were Breton allies of the Normans and further proposed this period for the early composition of the Tristan and Iseult cycle by poets such as Beroul from a pre-existing shared Brittonic oral tradition.|$|E
50|$|Kadare's {{thoughts}} on the legend, which stem from many of his <b>books,</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> the legend <b>is</b> pre-Christian, hence the rise from the dead motif.|$|R

25|$|Turkle's main {{argument}} {{in the first part}} of the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> our interactions with robots that simulate emotion pose serious threats to our ability to relate to one another properly. Turkle discusses robots that have been designed to interact with humans on an emotional level; she fears that they may then replace other humans and animals in these emotional roles. Turkle is concerned that we often attribute certain qualities to robots that the robots do not in fact possess, and that our emotional interactions with other humans become eroded as a direct result. Turkle's concern is that our appreciation for human interaction may become eroded.|$|E
25|$|The reason I didn't {{review the}} <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it perhaps {{would have taken}} me three weeks. My {{appreciation}} {{of it is that}} diverse and that complicated... John is perhaps the only contemporary writer who I know now who gives me the sense of the fact that life is—the life that we perform is in an environment that enjoys a grandeur that escapes us. Rabbit is very much possessed of a paradise lost, of a paradise known fleetingly perhaps through erotic love and a paradise that he pursues through his children. It's the vastness of John's scope that I would have described if I could through a review.|$|E
25|$|In The Lord of the Rings film trilogy {{directed}} by Peter Jackson, these creatures are 6m (20ft) tall {{with a maximum}} wingspan of 23m (75ft). A notable deviation from the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> Gandalf summons Gwaihir to Orthanc {{with the aid of}} a by-passing moth (the role of Radagast was not included in the film). The same moth also appears to him before the Eagles arrive at the Battle of the Morannon, and a similar sequences of events (though with a different moth) is played out in Jackson's first installment of The Hobbit. According to fantasy artist Larry Dixon, the digitally animated eagles in the trilogy were based on a stuffed golden eagle he had offered to Weta Workshop for use in the project.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{examples}} cited in Johnston's <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of J. D. Rockefeller deciding where to build his first major oil refinery. Instead of taking the easier, cheaper route from the oil fields to refine his petroleum in Pittsburgh, Rockefeller chose to build his refinery in Cleveland. Why? Because rail companies would be transporting his refined oil to market. Pittsburgh had just one major railroad, meaning it could dictate prices in negotiations, while Cleveland had three railroads that Rockefeller knew would compete for his business, potentially reducing his costs significantly. The leverage gained in these rail negotiations more than offset the additional operating costs of sending his oil to Cleveland for refining, helping establish Rockefeller's empire, while undermining his competitors who failed to integrate their core operating decisions with their negotiation strategies.|$|E
25|$|Swift's {{explanation}} {{for the title of}} the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the Ship of State was threatened by a whale (specifically, the Leviathan of Thomas Hobbes) and the new political societies (the Rota Club is mentioned). His book is intended to be a tub that the sailors of state (the nobles and ministers) might toss over the side to divert the attention of the beast (those who questioned the government and its right to rule). Hobbes was highly controversial in the Restoration, but Swift's invocation of Hobbes might well be ironic. The narrative of the brothers is a faulty allegory, and Swift's narrator is either a madman or a fool. The book is not one that could occupy the Leviathan, or preserve the Ship of State, so Swift may be intensifying the dangers of Hobbes's critique rather than allaying them to provoke a more rational response.|$|E
25|$|The Colditz Story (Hodder & Stoughton, 1952) was Reid's {{memoir of}} his time in Colditz, which later became the basis for the 1955 film The Colditz Story, {{directed}} by Guy Hamilton, with John Mills playing Reid. Although focusing mainly upon life inside Colditz and the development of an 'escape academy', the final chapters of the book are devoted to Reid's own escape. The book chronicles everyday prison life, in which characters such as Douglas Bader and Airey Neave appear with no special mention, reporting events in an anecdotal and almost comical style. On 14 October 1942 Reid, along three other British officers, escaped and made their way to neutral Switzerland. What Reid does not mention in his <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> he escaped using Hans Larive's Singen route. Larive, a Dutch naval lieutenant, attempted his first escape from Oflag VI-A in Soest in 1940, but was caught at the Swiss border. The interrogating Gestapo officer was so confident the war would soon be won by Germany that he told Larive the safe way across the border. Larive memorized the information, and many prisoners later escaped using this route.|$|E

25|$|All Hands Down {{was written}} by Kenneth R. Sewell, a nuclear {{engineer}} and a U.S. Navy veteran who spent five years aboard , a fast attack submarine. It attempts to link the sinking of Scorpion with the Pueblo incident, the John Anthony Walker spy ring, and Cold War Soviet aggression. The thesis of this <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> action off the Canary Islands was the direct cause of the sinking. The author purports that this is supported by motives in the Soviet Navy following the sinking of K-129, which caused the Russian Navy to trap a U.S. submarine. The bait for this trap would be strange military operations and furtive naval manoeuvres in the Atlantic, accompanied by countermeasures that would only seemingly be defeated by the deployment of a nuclear submarine. With information from spying by Walker, the position and arrival time of Scorpion was known by the Russians, and its sinking followed the springing of the trap. The book claims Scorpion was sunk by a Ka-25 helicopter equipped with anti-submarine torpedoes, which took off from one ship and landed on a different one. This was so that no one, other than the aircrew of the helicopter, would notice one torpedo missing.|$|E
500|$|The main {{conclusion}} of the <b>book</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{there would have been}} more progress in policymaking, if not for the influence of the contrarian [...] "experts", which tried on ideological reasons to undermine trust in the science base for regulation.

500|$|In his {{introduction}} Stace writes that Time and Eternity {{is an attempt}} to set out the fundamental nature of religion, and to deal with the conflict between religion and naturalism.
