50|$|Bovine {{herpesvirus}} 2 (BoHV2) is a virus of {{the family}} Herpesviridae that causes two diseases in cattle, <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> and pseudo-lumpy skin disease. BoHV2 is similar in structure to human herpes simplex virus.|$|E
50|$|Pseudo-lumpy {{skin disease}} was {{originally}} discovered in South Africa where a similar but more serious disease {{caused by a}} poxvirus, lumpy skin disease, is also prevalent. Symptoms include fever and skin nodules on the face, back, and perineum. The disease heals within a few weeks. <b>Bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> is characterized by lesions restricted to the teats and udder. BoHV-2 probably spreads through an arthropod vector, but can also be spread through milkers and milking machines.|$|E
40|$|In immunoelectrophoretic {{analyses}} {{one common}} antigen was demonstrated in antigen preparations from {{herpes simplex virus}} types 1 - and 2 - (HSV- 1 and HSV- 2), <b>bovine</b> herpes <b>mammillitis</b> (BHM) virus-, and B virus-infected cells solubilized by Triton X- 100. The antigen was also demonstrated in solubilized purified HSV- 1 and BHM virus. The common antigen was identified as antigen 11 of HSV- 1 or HSV- 2. Differences {{were found in the}} polypeptide composition of the related antigens when isolated from the four different herpesviruses, but a glycopolypeptide with a molecular weight of 125, 000 was present {{in each of the four}} different antigen preparations, indicating that this polypeptide carried the common antigenic determinants...|$|R
40|$|Genomes of {{herpesvirus}} aotus type 2 (HVA- 2) and bovine herpesvirus type 4 (BHV- 4) {{have previously}} {{been shown to}} be closely similar. Moreover, prelimi-nary serological data indicated that HVA- 2 is antigeni-cally related to BHV- 4. To extend this study, structural components of four BHV- 4 strains and HVA- 2 were compared by SDS-PAGE, radioimmunoprecipitation and Western blotting. The overall pattern of structural proteins was the same for HVA- 2 and BHV- 4 but variations were observed in electrophoretic profiles of glycoproteins, mainly of the two major ones (gp 6 /gp 10 /gp 17 and gp 11 /VP 24). Variations between HVA- 2 and BHV- 4 glycoproteins were greater than those observed among BHV- 4 strains. Three bovine herpesviruses (BHV) have been isolated from a variety of diseases and latent infections of cattle (Ludwig, 1983). BHV- 1 and BHV- 2 are responsible for infectious bovine rhinotracheitis/pustular vulvovaginitis and <b>bovine</b> herpes <b>mammillitis</b> respectively. BHV- 4 (Bartha et al., 1987) is readily distinguishable from other BHVs by serological comparisons with polyvalent or monovalent antibodies or by restriction enzyme analyses (reviewed by Thiry et al., 1989). BHV- 4 has been classified as a cytomegalovirus primarily because certain features of its replication cycle are characteristic ofcyto-megalovirus replication (Storz et al., 1984). More recent observations on the structure of the genome of BHV- 4 (Ehlers et al., 1985; Bublot et al., 1990) and the detection of a viral thymidine kinase (Kit et al., 1986) suggest however that BHV- 4 may {{be a member of the}} gamma-herpesvirinae group (Honess, 1984; Thiry et al., 1990...|$|R
40|$|Reference strains {{and field}} {{isolates}} of herpesviruses recovered from cattle in the U. S. were compared by restriction endonuclease (RE) analysis and the indirect {{fluorescent antibody test}} (IFAT). As {{a result of this}} comparison five major biotypes of bovine herpesvirus were defined. These types were: (1) infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (Bovine herpesvirus 1 : BHV- 1); (2) <b>bovine</b> herpes <b>mammillitis</b> virus (<b>Bovine</b> herpesvirus- 2 : BHV- 2); (3) malignant catarrhal fever virus (MCFV: Herpesvirus alcelaphinae); (4) the group of slow cytopathic effect (CPE) isolates represented by the prototype strain Movar 33 / 63 (bovine cytomegalovirus candidate) and (5) the syncytia-forming Pennsylvania 47 strain. A low but consistent level of serologic cross-reactivity was detected among MCFV, the Movar group and Pennsylvania 47. No isolate from American domestic cattle was similar to the African MCFV, which has been sporadically isolated in the U. S. from exotic ruminants. The possibility of Pennsylvania 47 strain being the causal agent of non-wildebeest-associated MCF is discussed. Several non-syncytial, slow CPE strains, which were recovered from dissimilar clinical syndromes and were serologically related to Movar 33 / 63, exhibited very similar DNA RE cleavage patterns, confirming their identity as members of a single type. Rabbits were inoculated with a cell-culture propagated suspension of the strain Movar 33 / 63, and sacrificed at different intervals between 3 days and 42 weeks postinfection (PI). Cell-free infectious virus was detected only in conjunctival secretions, buffy coat and spleen homogenates up to 7 days PI. Beyond this brief acute replication period, co-cultivation or explanation was required for the detection of viral infectivity. The spleen, the only organ from which virus was consistently recovered, exhibited the highest infectious titers as detected by infectious center assay. The use of several cell fractionation techniques allowed separation of B-enriched, T-enriched and non-T, non-B cell fractions. Infectivity during the acute and persistent phases of the infection was associated with the non-T, non-B population which was highly enriched in adherent and non-adherent spleen mononuclear phagocytes. No virus was isolated from either T or B cells. No histologic injury was detected in the organs. A protocol for optimal detection of Movar 33 / 63 -specific nucleic acids by cytohybridization has been developed...|$|R
40|$|Previously, we {{have shown}} a common antigen of several herpesviruses (pseudorabies virus, equine {{abortion}} virus and <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus) to be antigenically related to the major DNA-binding proteins of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2. In this study we have purified the cross-reacting polypeptide from cells infected with pseudorabies virus, equine abortion virus and <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus and shown the cross-reacting protein {{to be a major}} DNA-binding protein for each virus. Tryptic peptide analysis of the cross-reacting DNA-binding proteins of all five viruses has shown structural similarities. The proteins thus were shown to share common antigenic sites, to have similar biological properties and to have a highly conserved amino acid sequence. This unexpected similarity between proteins from diverse herpesviruses suggests an essential and fundamental role of the major DNA-binding protein in herpes virus replication...|$|E
40|$|Canine {{herpesvirus}} (CHV) {{was compared}} {{with four other}} herpesviruses by several serological techniques. Cross-neutralization was demonstrated between CHV and herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2 and pseudorabies virus. Non-neutralizing cross-reactions were found with these viruses and also with equine abortion virus and <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus. The data suggest that CHV is immunologically {{more closely related to}} herpes simplex virus than to the other viruses used in this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{tumorigenicity}} of neoplastic hamster {{and mouse}} cell lines and tumour explants was reduced by infection with {{herpes simplex virus}} (HSV- 1), a thymidine-kinaseless mutant of herpes simplex virus, namely 'MDK', encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC) and <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus (BMV). There was an approximate relationship between duration of virus infection in vitro and reduction in incidence and/or rate of tumour development. The rate of tumour development was also reduced by 'site inoculation' of virus (HSV- 1) at various time intervals following inoculation of tumorigenic BHK 21 cells indicating that virus was capable of reducing the rate of tumour development {{in a situation where}} the neoplastic cells were already transplanted into the susceptible host species. It is suggested that the therapeutic role of wild type, mutant or recombinant viruses merits further exploration towards prevention and treatment of human cancer...|$|E
40|$|Monospecific rabbit {{antisera}} gainst purified herpes implex virus type 1 (HSV- 1) gB, gC or gD antigens or polyvalent rabbit antiserum against equine herpesvirus type 1 (EHV- 1) -infected cells {{was used}} in Western blotting to identify antigenically related proteins in cells infected with HSV- 1, HSV- 2, <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus or EHV- 1. Monomeric and oligomeric polypeptides related to HSV- 1 gB were found in cells infected {{with each of the}} four herpesviruses. The gC antiserum was specific for HSV- 1 and the gD antiserum reacted only with polypeptides in HSV- 1 - or HSV- 2 -infected cells. Neither gC nor gD antiserum revealed the existence of oligomeric forms of the glycoproteins with the single exception of HSV- 1 strain KOS which had a heat-unstable high molecular weight form of gD. The EHV- 1 antiserum reacted with high molecular weight polypeptides of the same mobility as the oligomeric form of gB in cells infected with each of the four herpesviruses. Of the four herpes implex virus (HSV) glycoproteins, gC, gB, gD and gE, only one, gB, has been shown to have an essential role in virion infectivity possibly due to an involvement in virion penetration of the host cell (Sarmiento et al., 1979; Little et al., 1981). Glycoprotein B i...|$|E
40|$|The polypeptides soluble in 0. 25 M-HC 1 were {{extracted}} from the nuclei of BHK cells infected with herpes simplex virus type 1 or type 2 and separated by SDS-PAGE. Seventeen polypeptides were detectable in each extract of which 10 type 1 and nine type 2 polypeptides were reproducibly effectively extracted. In cells infected with <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus, pseudorabies virus or equine herpesvirus type 1, at least 12, 13 and eight polypeptides respectively were acid-soluble. In addition to histones, three other cellular polypeptides were present in sizeable quantities in the acid extracts and could obscure other acid-soluble viral polypeptides. Possible relationships between some polypeptides of the five herpesviruses are discussed. During productive infection, herpes implex viruses pecify at least 50 polypeptides (Honess & Roizman, 1973; Powell & Courtney, 1975; Marsden et al., 1976), {{a large number of}} which are thought o be involved in DNA synthesis. One approach which has been adopted to select and allow characterization f such proteins has been to isolate and identify DNA-binding proteins, as many as 23 of which have been reported (Bayliss et al., 1975; Powell & Purifoy, 1976; Wilcox et al., 1980; Bookout & Levy, 1980). These DNA-binding proteins are likely to be basic i...|$|E
40|$|The {{proteins}} of five herpesviruses- herpes implex types I and 2 (HSV-I and HSV- 2), <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus (BMV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) and equine abortion virus (EAV) - {{have been}} compared by polyacrylamide g l electrophoresis of purified virus and by antigenic analysis using virus neutralization a d agar-gel immunodiffusion tests. Although there were general {{similarities in the}} number, size range and overall complexity of polypeptides separated by polyacrylamide g l electrophoresis from purified particles of the five viruses, no single component of identical mobility was present in all viruses. The major capsid polypeptide {{from each of the}} five viruses comprised about Io ~ of virion protein mass but had distinctive mol. wt. of 158000 to 160000 (HSV- 2 and BMV), 145000 (EAV) and 140000 (PRV) relative to 155000 for HSV- 1. Despite differences of apparent tool. wt. there was a one-for-one correspondence for the majority of structural polypeptides of HSV-I and HSV- 2 and many poly-peptides of BMV were recognizably analogous to those of HSV-x and HSV- 2. In contrast the polypeptides of PRV and, more particularly, EAV differed markedly from those of all the other viruses. The antigenic analysis complemented these results; HSV- 1, HSV- 2 and BMV all cross-neutralized, whereas PRV and EAV were only neutralized by homologous antisera. Agar gel immunodiffusion tests with extracts of infected cells demonstrated at least one antigen common to all five viruses and showed BMV to be more closely related to HSV-I and HSV- 2 than were PRV or EAV although less closely related than HSV-t to HSV- 2. PRV and EAV share more antigens with each other than with the other viruses...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} reported that <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus (BMV) DNA {{consists of two}} covalently linked components designated L and S and estimated to be 71. 5 x 10 (6) and 15. 7 x 10 (6) in molecular weight, respectively; the components invert relative to each other, giving rise to four equimolar populations differing soley in the relative orientation of the two components. We now report that (i) BMV DNA has a contour length corresponding to a molecular weight of 89 x 10 (6). (ii) Component L consists of a unique sequence (Ul) bracketed by sequences ab and its inverted repeat b'a', estimated to be of molecular weights 66. 1 x 10 (6), 2. 7 x 10 (6), and 2. 7 x 10 (6), respectively. (iii) Component S consists of a unique sequence (Us) bracketed be sequence ca and its inverted repeat a'c', estimated to be of molecular weights 8. 3 x 10 (6), 3. 7 x 10 (6), and 3. 7 x 10 (6), respectively. (iv) The a sequences present at the termini of a complete linear molecule (abUlb'a'a'c'Usca) are arranged in tandem so that the DNA can circularize after limited digestion with arranged in tandem so that the DNA can circularize after limited digestion with lambda 5 '-exonuclease. The size of the a sequences {{was estimated to be}} 0. 7 x 10 (6) in molecular weight. (v) At least portions of the a sequences are repeated in an inverted orientation immediately adjacent to or near the a sequence. Thus, BMV DNA mimics herpes simplex virus type 1 DNA with respect to the arrangement but not size of deoxynucleotide sequences. The evolutionary relationship of BMV DNA relative to other herpesvirus DNAs is discussed...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} that the DNA of <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus (BMV) {{consists}} of two covalently linked components that are 71. 5 × 106 and 15. 7 × 106 in molecular weight and designated L and S, respectively. We further report that the BMV DNA consists of four equimolar populations differing only in {{the orientation of the}} L and S components relative to each other. This conclusion is based on the following: (i) The sum molecular weight of fragments generated by digestion of BMV DNA with Hsu I, Hpa I, Bgl II, or Xba I significantly exceeds the established molecular weight of the intact DNA. (ii) In each digest, the fragments form three groups differing in molar concentration. In reference to the molar concentration of intact DNA, each enzyme digest contained a set of four fragments 0. 25 M in concentration, a set of four fragments 0. 5 M in concentration, and a variable size set, unique for each enzyme digest, 1. 0 M in concentration. (iii) Experiments involving digestion of intact DNA by lambda exonuclease followed by restriction endonuclease digestion established that each of four 0. 5 M fragments were positioned at the termini of the BMV DNA. (iv) Complete maps for the fragments generated by each enzyme established that the 0. 25 M fragments arise by fusion of the sequences of the terminal fragments when these are juxtaposed {{as a consequence of the}} inversion of L and S components. The maps also established the dimensions of the L and S components. We conclude that the structure of BMV DNA is similar to that of HSV DNA previously shown to consist of two unequal size components that invert relative to each other...|$|E
40|$|Herpes simplex virus (HSV) genes form three groups, alpha, beta, and gamma, whose {{synthesis}} is coordinately regulated and sequentially {{ordered in}} a cascade fashion. Earlier studies by Post et al. (Cell 24 : 555 - 565, 1981) have shown that chimeric genes constructed by fusion of 5 ' noncoding leader and upstream sequences of alpha genes to the 5 ' noncoding leader and structural sequences of the viral thymidine kinase (TK), a beta gene, are regulated as alpha genes upon recombination into the viral genome. In cells converted from TK- to TK+ phenotype, these chimeric genes are induced by infection with homologous TK- virus. The induction of the resident chimeric gene does not require viral protein synthesis and is independent {{of the presence of}} functional alpha gene 4 product required for the expression of beta genes. In this paper, we report on the properties of the alpha-TK gene chimera resident in converted TK+ murine (L 316) and human (I 316) cells. Our results were as follows. (i) The pattern of induction of L 316 cells exposed to 0. 1, 1. 0, and 10 PFU per cell suggested that exposure to competent virus is required for induction and that in untreated preparations this virus corresponds to infectious virus. (ii) UV light-irradiated virus was just as effective as untreated virus in inducing alpha-TK chimeras. (iii) HSV- 1 (HFEM) tsB 7 induced the alpha-TK gene chimeras at the nonpermissive (39 degrees C) temperature; at 39 degrees C the parental HSV- 1 (HFEM) tsB 7 capsids accumulate at nuclear pores and do not release viral DNA. (iv) The alpha-TK gene chimeras were not induced by infection with spontaneous TK- mutants of pseudorabies virus and <b>bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> virus or with human cytomegalovirus or adenovirus type 2 or by exposure to lysates of HSV- 1 -infected cells from which the virus was removed by centrifugation. These results indicate that the alpha gene inducer is a virion component located outside the capsid and that its function might be to stimulate the transcription of alpha genes by recognizing regulatory sites on viral DNAs or host cell products or both...|$|E
40|$|Foot {{and mouth}} disease (FMD) {{is a highly}} {{infectious}} and contagious viral disease affecting bovidae (cattle, zebus, domestic buffaloes, yaks), sheep, goats, swine, all wild ruminants and suidae. Camelidae (camels, dromedaries, llamas, vicunas) have low susceptibility. Foot and mouth disease {{is caused by a}} RNS virus of the family Picornaviridae, genus Aphthovirus. There are seven immunologically distinct serotypes: A, O, C, SAT 1, SAT 2, SAT 3, Asia 1. Foot and mouth disease causes significant economic loss both to countries who manage it as an endemic disease (with or without vaccination), as well as those FMD free countries which may become infected. The mortality rate is low in adult animals, but often higher in young due to myocarditis. Foot and mouth disease is endemic in parts of Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America (sporadic outbreaks in free areas). The Office of International Epizootics (OIE), also referred to the World Organization for Animal Health maintains an official list of free countries and zones. 1 The OIE Terrestrial Code (Chapter 2. 2. 10) provides detailed information on the categories of freedom that can be allocated to a country as well as guidelines for the surveillance for foot and mouth disease (Appendix 3. 8. 7). In short, countries may be completely free of FMD, free with vaccination or infected with foot and mouth disease virus (FMDV). Source of FMDV include incubating and clinically affected animals with virus present in breath, saliva, faeces, urine, milk and semen. In experimental settings virus has been detected in milk several days before the onset of clinical signs 2. Additional sources of virus are meat and by-products in which pH has remained above 6. 0 as well as persistently infected carrier animals. Carrier animals may include cattle and water buffalo; convalescent animals and exposed vaccinates (virus persists in the oropharynx for up to 30 months in cattle or longer in buffalo, 9 months in sheep). Pigs do not become carriers. It has been shown that the African Cape buffalo are the major maintenance host of SAT serotypes. FMDV transmission can occur by either direct or indirect contact. Indirect transmission can occur via contaminated animate vectors (humans, etc.), inanimate vectors (vehicles, implements) or airborne transmission. Indirect disease transmission via animate or inanimate vectors can {{play a major role in}} disease transmission. Good biosecurity can significantly reduce this type of transmission. Airborne transmission is often debated and is known to be serotype and species specific as well as require specific environmental conditions to occur. Airborne transmission is favored in temperate zones and has been postulated to occur over distances of up to 60 km overland and 300 km by sea. Foot and mouth disease virus is an unenveloped virus which is preserved by refrigeration and freezing and progressively inactivated by temperatures above 50 C. FMDV is highly sensitive to pH change and is inactivated by pH 9. 0. There are many disinfectants which are effective against FMDV including sodium hydroxide (2 %), sodium carbonate (4 %), and citric acid (0. 2 %). FMDV is resistant to iodophores, quaternary ammonium compounds, hypochlorite and phenol, especially in the presence of organic matter. The virus can survive in lymph nodes and bone marrow at neutral pH, but is destroyed in muscle when is pH < 6. 0 i. e. after rigor mortis. FMDV can persist in contaminated feed/commodities and the environment for over to 1 month, depending on the temperature and pH conditions. The incubation period for FMD is 2 - 14 days. Animals transition through latent (infected but not infectious), subclinically infected (infectious but lacking clinical signs) clinically infected and recovered disease states. In cattle clinical signs include pyrexia, reluctance to eat, bruxism, drooling, lameness, treading or stamping of the feet and decreased milk production. Most clinical signs are related to the development and subsequent rupturing of vesicles at the coronary band and in the oral cavity. Vesicles and ulcerations can also occur on the mammary gland. Recovery in adult animals usually occurs in 8 - 15 days. Clinical signs for most serotypes are less dramatic in sheep and goats. Swine can develop very severe coronary band lesions and high mortality in piglets has been observed. One of the challenges of diagnosing FMD is that it may be clinically similar to several other vesicular or ulcerative diseases. FMD is clinically indistinguishable from Vesicular stomatitis, Swine vesicular disease and Vesicular exanthema of swine. It may also resemble Bovine viral diarrhea, Mucosal disease, Infectious bovine rhinotracheitis, Bluetongue, Bovine papular stomatitis, <b>Bovine</b> <b>mammillitis</b> and Rinderpest...|$|E
