40|$|ABSTRACT: Most bridge {{structures}} are analysed using linear elastic theory. Results {{from such an}} analysis are usually an adequate basis for design since non-linear effects are small and can {{be accounted for by}} safety factors or even be ignored. Some non-linear effects are also taken into account to some degree on a design check level. However, during the analysis of long-span bridges, especially in cable suspended bridges, non-linear effects often reach magnitudes that make it imperative to include them into the analysis of such bridge structures. Much research has been produced on this topic, especially on cable-stayed and suspension bridges. However, in order to make this research accessible for practising engineers, a number of steps still had to be taken. This paper presents the results of a research project which investigated the theoretical background of non-linear structural bridge analysis. Generalisation of existing literature was complimented by further research to find ways of implementing non-linear procedures into a general <b>bridge</b> design <b>software</b> <b>package</b> suitable for use in a practical bridge design environment. The theoretical background of the application is outlined and the implementation into the <b>bridge</b> design <b>software</b> is described briefly. Practical application examples are given to illustrate the principles described in this paper...|$|R
40|$|The Indiana Bridge Management System (IBMS) <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> {{considered}} one of the few <b>bridge</b> management system <b>software</b> <b>packages</b> in the United States, possesses several unique features such as multiple criteria analysis but has not been used to its full capabilities because of coding language, outmoded operating system, and other software-related problems. Also, the framework lacked certain considerations such as a preventive maintenance component. In addressing this issue, this study reviewed the existing internal logic of IBMS, and updated some of the cost and deterioration models to include preventive maintenance considerations in the decision tree. Also, the IBMS operating system and programming language were updated, and the entire code was rewritten in a new coding platform. The new <b>software</b> <b>package</b> is provided with a new easy-to-use graphical user interface. In rewriting the code, newly available computer programming techniques were identified and used to enhance the program efficiency. The research product is expected to facilitate identification of alternative actions and predict their impacts and costs, and identify optimal preservation policies. Thus the package offers a rational basis by which defensible policies and programs can be developed, compared and selected within performance and budget constraints. The package will help INDOT to perform short-term and long-term forecasting of physical and financial needs at both project level and network level. The package can be used to generate reports on trends of individual and network bridge condition at the current time or at any future time corresponding to the prescribed bridge actions. In effect, the research product is useful to Indiana bridge management engineers as a decision-support tool in their business practices...|$|R

40|$|This project {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} varying two different elements of bridge management strategies. The first element was a trigger value (an NBI condition rating for a bridge component) at which a maintenance treatment can be performed. The second element was the budget. A new <b>software</b> program, the <b>Bridge</b> Management Research System (BMRS), was created to test these elements of bridge management strategies for Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s bridge network. BMRS is a simplified version of a previous <b>bridge</b> management <b>software</b> <b>package</b> developed by Purdue University, the Indiana Bridge Management System (IBMS). To test variations in the trigger values, three different bridge management strategies were proposed: a standard maintenance strategy, an early maintenance strategy, and a late maintenance strategy. The standard maintenance strategy allows for maintenance for bridge components with condition ratings from 1 to 5, the early maintenance strategy allows for maintenance for components with condition ratings from 1 to 6, and the late maintenance strategy allows for maintenance for components with condition ratings from 1 to 4. To test variations in the budget for Indiana 2 ̆ 7 s bridge network, three different budgets were used: a 150 million budget, a 200 million budget, and a 250 million budget. To evaluate each bridge management strategy, a distribution analysis, a threshold analysis, and a utility analysis were all performed. Distribution analysis looks at how many bridges are between two component condition ratings, threshold analysis looks at how many bridges have ratings {{greater than or equal}} to a given component condition rating, and utility analysis looks at how well each maintenance strategy meets certain criteria. After performing these analyses, this study found that, for any of the three budget levels, the standard maintenance strategy leads to better systemwide bridge performance than either the early or late maintenance strategies. ...|$|R
