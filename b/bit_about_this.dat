40|$|The aim of information-theoretic secrecy is {{to ensure}} that an eavesdropper who listens to the {{wireless}} transmission of a message can only collect an arbitrarily small number of information <b>bits</b> <b>about</b> <b>this</b> message. In contrast to cryptography, there are no assumptions on the computational power of the eavesdropper. Information-theoretically secret communication has been studied for many particular wireless network topologies. In the main part of this thesis, we consider such communication for arbitrary acyclic wireless network topologies. We provide lower and upper bounds on the strong perfect secrecy capacity for the case when the channels of the network are either Gaussian or deterministic. These results are based on the recent understanding of the capacity of wireless networks (without secrecy constraints) by Avestimehr, Diggavi and Tse. As a side result, we give inner and outer bounds on the capacity region for the multisource problem in arbitrary wireless networks with Gaussian o...|$|R

MPEG-7 can be used independently of the other MPEG standards - the description might even be attached to an analog movie. The representation that is defined within MPEG-4, i.e. the representation of audio-visual data in terms of objects, is however very well suited to what will be built on the MPEG-7 standard.

40|$|Extract] A while ago, {{for those}} of you who read these pieces regularly, you might {{remember}} that I spent a bit of time talking about inferential statistics and the question of significance. One of the areas that I touched on, relatively briefly, was the concept of clinical significance. I've been thinking a <b>bit</b> more <b>about</b> <b>this</b> concept lately and thought it might be worthwhile spending more time talking <b>about</b> <b>this.</b> The idea of Clinical Significance came about because there was an increasing criticism of the types of research methodologies applied to real world clinical interventions. Until quite recently the assessment of the relevance of data in psychotherapy outcome studies has tended to rely on methodologies which have emphasised internal validity (e. g. Randomised Controlled Trials). This approach essentially establishes efficacy — whether or not there is some 'active ingredient' that may be causally related to change. But, there has been a growing recognition that the question that is of most relevance, particularly to clinicians, is one of effectiveness. That is, whether the use of an intervention under more realistic (i. e. 'less controlled') conditions leads to change in 'real' clients. There are a range of arguments against using naturalistic design methodologies from a science perspective, but many clinicians intuitively accept the argument that unless you are using real clients under real conditions it is very hard to argue that an intervention has been properly tested...|$|R
