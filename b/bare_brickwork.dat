50|$|Built in 1167, it is {{characterized}} by an octagonal plan, {{a reference to the}} cult of St. Ambrose of Milan, symbolizing the Eight Day of Resurrection and, thenceforth, the Baptism.The edifice mixes Romanesque and Lombard-Gothic styles, the latter evident in the preference for <b>bare</b> <b>brickwork</b> walls. To the 16th century restorations belong the marble cover of some walls, the pavement and the baptismal font (1531) and the narthex (1588) of the entrance, in Romanesque style, work by Angelo Nani.|$|E
50|$|The {{station is}} a {{terminus}} but architecturally resembles the large main-line {{stations of the}} Nord company's network, with two corner pavilions. The semi-circular arched windows {{on the ground floor}} and mansard roofs with dormer windows lend it the appearance of a bourgeois residence. The clock identifies it as a station and echoes the seaside style that corresponds to the environment of Mers. Originally the walls of the building were not plastered but made up of <b>bare</b> <b>brickwork,</b> as in the majority of Le Tr√©port buildings. The station therefore represented the contrasting identities of the two towns which it served.|$|E
5000|$|Burglengenfeld, a {{city with}} about 10,000 inhabitants, was not {{prepared}} for such a stampede of visitors. Already {{on the eve of}} the festival, in the supermarkets all staple food and alcoholic drinks were sold out. Several shops closed their doors and did not open them on the following Sunday either. Not having any mobile phones yet, on all church doors there were pinned written notes, informing when to meet whom and where. Every <b>bare</b> <b>brickwork</b> the visitors used as a [...] "roof over their head", as a place to sleep. Anyhow, the thefts, damages of property or even riots the inhabitants had feared held off.|$|E
25|$|The 25 seats {{from the}} biblical {{reference}} are alluded {{to in the}} building's structure, {{with the addition of}} eight small onion domes around the central tent, four around the western side church and four elsewhere. This arrangement survived through most of the 17th century. The walls of the church mixed <b>bare</b> red <b>brickwork</b> or painted imitation of bricks with white ornaments, in roughly equal proportion. The domes, covered with tin, were uniformly gilded, creating an overall bright but fairly traditional combination of white, red and golden colors. Moderate use of green and blue ceramic inserts provided a touch of rainbow as prescribed by the Bible.|$|R
5000|$|And he {{that sat}} {{was to look}} upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: {{and there was a}} rainbow round about the throne, in sight like unto an emerald.And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold. [...] Revelation, 4:3 - 4:4 (KJV) The 25 seats from the biblical {{reference}} are alluded to in the building's structure, with the addition of eight small onion domes around the central tent, four around the western side church and four elsewhere.

5000|$|... 1906: Stein {{revisited}} on {{his second}} expedition in September 1906. As {{a result of the}} activities of treasure seekers most of the colossal statues had disappeared by Stein's second visit in 1906: 'the wall, which I had found lined with a continuous row of stucco relievo figures, mostly colossal, now displayed <b>bare</b> <b>brickwork.</b> My care in burying these under sand, just as I had found them, proved in vain, and of the interesting specimens of Khotan sculptural art then unearthed, all that survives now, I fear, are my photographs.'On this visit Stein excavated the ruins that lay between the great stupa and a nearby site complex known as Tati of Hanguya. Here he found many small terracotta reliefs dating, he thought, to the 5-6th centuries.|$|E
