40|$|The new {{paradigm}} of pharmaceutical industry is to move from batch to continuous processes {{in order to satisfy}} the stringent requirements of quality, safety and efficiency set by regulatory authorities and reduce production costs. In this perspective, freeze-drying needs to be completely rethought in order to be more integrated in the chain of production of drugs, more flexible to respond to variations in market needs and allowing the monitoring of product quality. The future of freeze-drying, as a downstream process, is therefore to move from batch to continuous. Over the past decades many ideas regarding continuous freeze-drying has been proposed, but none of them has been successfully applied. This work describes some of the drawbacks of <b>batch</b> <b>freeze-drying</b> and explains how these technical limits can solved by continuous technologies...|$|E
40|$|The {{feasibility}} study for producing a matrix reference material for selected pesticides in a carrot/potato matrix was investigated. A commercially available baby food (carrot/potato-based mash) was spiked with eleven pesticides at the respective EU {{maximum residue limits}} (MRLs), and further processed by either freeing or <b>freeze-drying.</b> <b>Batches</b> of some 150 units were produced per material type. First, the materials were assessed the relative amount of pesticide recovered after processing (ratio of pesticide concentration in the processed material to the initially spiked pesticide concentration). In addition, the materials' homogeneity (bottle to bottle variation), and the short-term (1 month) and mid-term (5 months) stability at different temperatures were assessed. For this, an in-house validated GC-EI-MS method operated in the SIM mode with a sample preparation procedure based on the QuEChERS ("quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged and safe") principle was applied. Measurements on the frozen material provided the most promising results (smallest analyte losses during production), and also freeze-drying {{proved to be a}} suitable alternative processing technique for most of the investigated pesticides. Both the frozen and the freeze-dried material showed to be sufficiently homogeneous for the intended use, and storage at - 20 Â°c for 5 months did not reveal any detectable material degradation. The results constitute an important step towards the development of a pesticide matrix reference material. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|R
