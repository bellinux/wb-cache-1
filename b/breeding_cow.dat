40|$|There are 1. 5 million {{breeding}} cows in New Zealand primarily run on {{hill country}} farms where most are farmed {{in conjunction with}} sheep. This is seldom to the short-term benefits of the cattle, but often improves the performance of sheep and the pasture. This should always be considered when evaluating the financial performance of a beef <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> enterprise. With appropriate management, breeding cows fill an important niche on hill country, particularly when the pasture growth curve has a large summer surplus and a contrasting winter deficit. The <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> herd is dominated by two breeds the Angus and Hereford. The heavier European breeds began to be imported in the late 1960 's and some, especially Simmental, Charolais, South Devon and Limousin have made an impact as Terminal sires, where all progeny (both male and female) are sold for slaughter or to finishing farms. In an effort to increase productivity and profitability {{there has also been}} increased use of the Hereford / Friesian crossbred cow, the Friesian introducing genes for higher milk production. The objectives of most commercial beef <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> herds are to: • rear to weaning a large number of calves (95) per 100 cows mated each year • wean calves with a heavy liveweight (50 % of autumn cow liveweight) • maintain a low death rate in the herd (2 to 3 % per annum) • make use of the <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> in promoting and maintaining improved pastures. The overall output of the <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> herd is dependent on both weaning % and weaning weight of the calf, these are often combined into a term called cow productivity. Productivity = no. of calves weaned x Av. weaning weightno. of cows joined with bull However, the total feed consumed by large cows is greater than that of small cows and to take account of this the weight of calf weaned per cow joined (ie the productivity) can be divided by the cow liveweight and used as a proxy measure of biological efficiency in the beef <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> herd...|$|E

This experiment aimed to examine the role of udder conformation, maternal age and breed-cross on the colostral status of suckled calves. Udder conformation of Angus, Angus-cross-Friesian, Angus-cross-Jersey and Angus-cross-Kiwicross cows was scored according to Animal Evaluation Limited and BreedPlan standards, and colostral status of calves was determined based on gamma glutamyltransferase activity, immunoglobulin G and total protein concentrations at 24 - 48 hours of age.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to: l) determine the contribution of federal land grazing to beef production in Utah and the 11 western states, and 2) trace the impact of hypothetical incremental reductions in federal land grazing in the 11 western states on total beef supply and retail beef prices in the United States. The federal land animal units in the 11 western states were obtained from Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service records. The animal units were converted into the number of breeding cows and feeder calves totally dependent on federal land grazing, with the help of animal units per <b>breeding</b> <b>cow.</b> The animal units per <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> were calculated from a representative stock count chart of a typical 50 cow Utah ranch. The same chart provided percentage proportions of the number of calves and feeder calves. These feeder calves are the animals that originate and are totally dependent on federal lands. The minimum contribution of federal land grazing in the 11 western states to total beef supply in the United States ranges between dressed beef from feeder calves and cull cows on one end, and slaughter animals and cull cows on the other. The actual minimum contribution is somewhere to the middle of these extremes. The hypothetical incremental reductions in federal land grazing were calculated in terms of percentage {{reduction in the number of}} cows, calves and feeder calves, and the resultant decreases in beef tonnage on the lower and upper limits of minimum contribution of these lands to total beef supply in the United States. These reductions in beef supply were compared to total United States 2 ̆ 7 beef supply and reductions in total beef supply were estimated in percentage. To estimate the economic and other impacts on individual ranchers, local communities and regional economy, the feed grain in corn equivalents and forage production were compared to livestock and poultry requirements in the 11 western states. It appears that Utah is deficient both in feed grain and roughage production as compared to requirements. The 11 western states as a group were surplus in 1974 in both feed grain and roughage production as compared to livestock and poultry requirements. The contribution of federal lands in roughage production was also estimated. The importance of federal rangelands 2 ̆ 7 contribution, in my study is only 25 percent of total roughage production in the 11 western states and is discussed in the light of other benefits that would be lost if grazing were eliminated from federal lands. Lastly, the impact of reduction in federal grazing in the 11 western states on retail beef prices was estimated by using the concept of price elasticity of demand. It was concluded that an increasingly higher percentage increase in retail prices would occur for given percentage decreases in beef supply (by way of hypothetical incremental reduction in federal land grazing) for increasingly inelastic coefficients of elasticity...|$|E

This study develops a decision support aid utilizing expert system technology to assist beef cattle producers in making well-founded investment decisions {{with respect to the}} firm’s beef cattle herd. Key Words: beef cattle investment, decision support, expert systems. The development of sound tools that use economic theory to assist beef producers in making <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> investment decisions is an important effort. A major study focusing on competitive issues in the beef sector for the 1990 s, conducted through the Hubert H. Humphrey Institute of Public Affairs, pointed to this need (Johnson et al.). One conclu-sion reached in that study was that beef producers must lower their costs of beef production to prevent further loss of market share to competing meats. The report concluded: Two factors are likely to be important in lowering cost of production in the future. The first is the need to use the most efficient production technol-ogy available. The second is the need to consoli-date production into even larger units so that all economies of size are realized.

40|$|High calf {{prices can}} hide a {{multitude}} of management sins. Low calf prices often force {{a closer look at}} production and financial practices. Looking at production costs may be painful, but it {{is the first step in}} looking at the farm or ranch as a collection of potential profit centers and determining which parts are coming up short. Cost-saving measures can be identified once the high cost items are noted. Production systems can be better matched to the resource base. Producers in the cattle business who are not profitable should minimize losses and better position themselves for the future. Cow-calf Standardized Performance Analysis (SPA) software was developed by producers, extension staff, and the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association Integrated Resource Management Committees to analyze production and financial performance jointly 2. SPA is used to develop and monitor key statistics over time (for example, cost per <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> or pounds weaned per exposed female). SPA reports are recognized as an invaluable tool in identifying the strengths and weaknesses of an individual operation. Costs that are out of line quickly become evident when compared to those of other producers around the country.

40|$|The {{abundance}} of Lehmann lovegrass (Eragrostis lehmanniana, Nees.) on Arizona ranges prompted this research {{to evaluate the}} animal production and winter palatability of this species. Sulfurcoated urea (SCU) was applied to desert grassland range to minimize the risks of fertilization that are brought about by drought and unseasonable rainfall. Tebuthiuron (TEB) was also applied to pasture to document any beneficial effects on forage production and palatability. During the 2 years of this project, two experiments were conducted. A preference study examined forage and animal responses to one-time applications of fertilizer or herbicide treatments and combinations. The second experiment compared the potentials for improved animal production from SCU and SCU + TEB with untreated range. Results indicated that the fertilizer and combination treatments produced more forage than the untreated plots. Tebuthiuron improved forage production by 200 {{percent in the first}} year but reduced yields in the second year. The high rate of TEB was detrimental in both years. Forage utilization was improved by all treatments. Nitrogen increased the crude protein content of the grasses proportional to the rate applied. Tebuthiuron also enhanced the protein content of the forage. Total available carbohydrates were lowest in TEB treated forages, but digestibility was increased. Only the 31 lb SCU appeared to be economically profitable. However, excellent carry-over by the 60 SCU treatment suggested profitability after 3 years. Results from the grazing study indicated that production was significantly improved by both treatments. Although forage production was similar for the treatments, the SCU-only pasture provided superior animal gains and greater carrying capacity than the SCU + TEB pasture, even though forage digestibility and apparent disappearance were greater on the combination pasture. The difference in animal performance was attributed to low levels of carbohydrates available from the combination pasture.

40|$|The present paper {{focuses on}} the {{economic}} evaluation of the observed differences in maternal productivity of different genetic lines in Angus cattle that were managed under contrasting nutritional regimes typical of southern Australia. Five hundred Angus cows were managed concurrently at two locations in southern Australia. On each site, the cows were managed under the following two different nutritional treatments: High and Low, to simulate different stocking rates. Cows selected for a divergence in either carcass rib-fat depth or residual feed intake based on mid-parent estimated breeding values for those traits, were allocated in replicate groups to either High- or Low-nutrition treatments. By design, the supplementary feeding regime was {{the same for the}} High and Low genetic lines to ensure genetic differences were not confounded with management differences. Animal productivity results from the experiment were used as input data to evaluate the economic performance of the four genetic lines under the two nutritional treatments. Two methods were used; the first was a gross-margin calculation of income minus variable costs as AU$ per <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> for a 1000 -cow herd; the second was a whole-farm linear programming model maximising the gross margin. Stocking rates were optimised by matching the energy requirements for the whole herd with the energy available from pasture and supplementary feed on a representative 700 -ha farm. Using the two methods of calculating gross margin (per cow and optimised per hectare), including examination of sensitivity to changes in prices of cattle and supplementary feed, the present study demonstrated that genetically leaner cows due to selection of low fat or low residual feed intake, had gross margins superior to those of genetically fatter cows. They generated more income by selling more liveweight due to heavier weights and higher stocking rates. The results are affected by the management system utilised and some confounding with growth (leaner genetic lines had higher growth estimated breeding values), but will assist producers to make more informed decisions about how to manage animal breeding and nutritional interactions...|$|E
40|$|Different {{patterns}} of nutrition during {{pregnancy and lactation}} can influence cow productivity {{and the performance of}} their offspring. An experiment was conducted on the North Coast of NSW whereby “low” and “high” pasture nutritional systems were imposed on a herd of Hereford cows during pregnancy, and then again from birth to weaning, with a crossover design also imposed to select offspring with extremes of growth to birth and/or weaning. Thus, four growth groups resulted – low-low, low-high, high-low, and high-high. Piedmontese and Wagyu bulls were used. After weaning, these offspring were grown out on the NSW Northern Tablelands and then finished to heavy market weights in a feedlot. The results of the experiment indicated that restricted early-life growth resulting in differences in weight of calves at weaning persisted until slaughter at 30 months of age. Animals that were smaller at weaning remained smaller at slaughter. Some compensation occurred following restriction of growth during lactation, but not following restriction of growth during pregnancy. However, neither carcass quality nor eating quality of the beef was adversely affected by growth restriction during early-life. An economic analysis of these data was done using the Beef-N-Omics decision support package. Two methods were used. The main results showed that for the representative cattle enterprise modelled, total gross margins ranged from $ 45, 500 for the low-low system to $ 52, 600 for the high-low system. Gross margin per hectare ranged from $ 114 for the low-low system to $ 132 for the high-low system, while gross margin per <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> ranged from $ 303 for the low-low system to $ 387 for the high-high system. In all cases, the gross margin for those groups with foetal growth based on a higher level of nutrition exceeded their peers on a lower level of nutrition. Therefore, it is more profitable for cows and calves to have access to a high standard of nutrition during pregnancy and up to weaning than for them to have access only to a poor standard of nutrition during this time period. beef, early-life nutrition, economic, evaluation, Australia, Agribusiness, Farm Management, Livestock Production/Industries, Production Economics, Research and Development/Tech Change/Emerging Technologies, Q 12, Q 16,...|$|E
40|$|It {{cannot be}} {{emphasised}} too much that calf raising {{must be based}} on grass utilization, since only with this we can increase the producers 2 ̆ 7 income and also can supply more beef to consumers at inexpensive prices. Japanese Brown Cattle is recognized as a breed of high utilization of roughage and of excellent daily gain of body weight. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the profitability of Japanese Brown Calf raising in Kumamoto Pref., a main raising provine in Japan. Farm records for the period 1976 - 1980 from the Survey on Production Cost of Japanese Brown Calves conducted by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japanese (MAFFJ) provided the data for this study. The results of calf raising farms are small scale and are operated in combination with rice production etc. In 1980, average number of <b>breeding</b> <b>cow</b> per household was 3. 9 heads. 2. Comparing the production costs and profitabilities among three types of operations such as grazing with rice production (Aso district), grazing with upland field cropping (Takamori district) and housing with rice production (Yabe district), a little diference was found out. One reason for this is longer accounting period of calf production in grazing districts. Secondly in the case of grazing districts, the input invested in purchasing feed and in family labor in order to raise high price calves is more than that in housing district. 3. Accouning period of production cost is dependent on managerial ability and opening times of calf marketing. The ideal accounting period of calf production is one year. 4. Atheoretical survey about economies of scale was carried out. Also, small scale calf raising possessed scale merit. 5. The profitability of calf raising was in very low levels compared with other agricultural and livestock products. The ratio of calf price upon secondary production cost was highly correlated with income. 6. Ammendment of the formal method of the calculation of the profitability by adding self-supplied indirect labor cost about forage crops, pasture and mowing grassland to income and family labor earning accounts for to a certain degree the existence of small scale calf raising. 7. Fluctuation of calf prices and habit of meat assessment by marbling to excess restricted the size enlargement of calf raising. 草資源に根ざした生産性の高い子牛生産こそ生産者の収益増大とともに，消費者により安価の牛肉を提供できる肉牛生産の基本方向であることはいうまでもない．本稿ではこのような認識に立って，放牧に適し増体量の優れた熊本県の褐毛和種を対象に， 1976 - 80 年までの子牛「生産費個表」を用い，その生産及び収益性の分析を行なうとともに将来への発展方向の模索を試みた．あわせて零細規模子牛生産農家の実態，規模の経済性及び計算期間についても分析した．分析結果は以下のとおりである．（ 1 ）現段階で規模拡大の傾向は鈍く，総じて零細規模である．全体的概況をみると， 1971 年から 80 年まで繁殖牛頭数は 27. 9 ％増加し，飼養戸数は一律的に減少した． 1980 年現在繁殖牛頭数 63. 5 千頭，飼養戸数 16. 4 千戸の水準で 1 戸当たり 3. 9 頭の規模である．同期間において 5 頭以下の規模が戸数割合で 90 ％以上を占めるのに対し， 11 頭以上は 1 ％以下である．しかし，草資源が豊富な阿蘇郡を中心とする先進地域においてはかなり規模拡大が進み， 1980 年現在阿蘇郡平均 1 戸当たり 5. 2 頭，同高森町は 6. 4 頭規模である．（ 2 ）零細規模において飼養形態（放牧，舎飼い）及び土地利用区分（水田，畑作）の違いからの生産費及び収益性の格差はあまり大きくなかった．阿蘇町（水田+放牧），高森町（畑作+放牧），矢部町（水田+舎飼い）において 1975 年基準の 5 年平均値で第 2 次生産費は，阿蘇町 347. 1 千円，高森町 305. 6 千円，矢部町 335. 2 千円であり，所得は阿蘇町 33. 9 千円，高森町 64. 6 千円，矢部町 32. 5 千円であった． 1 日当たり家族労働報酬は 1980 年現在阿蘇町 1. 2 千円，高森町 1. 1 千円，矢部町 2. 4 千円であった．阿蘇町及び高森町と矢部町の間に生産費及び収益性に大きな格差がない原因は，阿蘇町及び高森町の計算期間が矢部町より長いことと，子牛価格向上のため放牧地帯においても集約管理を図り購入飼料及び労働を多投する所にあることがわかった．（ 3 ）計算期間は経営者の飼養管理能力及び市場開設時期に依存する．計算期間は生産費分析上重要な概念であるが，このように質的・非経済的変数によって影響されるため，一方ではこれら質的要素の評価尺度になると同時に，他方では生産者の最適行動分析を妨げる攪乱要因にもなる．分析機関において計算期間の平均値は阿蘇町 1. 4 年，高森町 1. 4 年，矢部町 1. 1 年であった．理想型の計算期間は 1 年である．（ 4 ）規模の経済性はその考え方として産出量規模の拡大にともなう費用上の利益と投入量規模の拡大にともなう収益上の利益及び「適者生存手法」に大別される．規模の経済性の統計的測定方法は多数あるが，分析の際その前提条件，問題点及び規模拡大の規制要因の把握が重要である．零細規模の子牛生産においても規模の経済性が存在することが立証された． 1980 年において最小費用点は 4. 6 頭の 348. 1 千円であった．（ 5 ）所得が子牛価格と生産費の比率と密接な関係にあることを実証した．子牛生産部門の収益性が他部門に比べ非常に低いことがわかった．子牛生産の 1 日当たり家族労働報酬は 1980 年水準で，黒毛和種，水稲，農業臨時雇賃金の約 1 / 2 ，肥育牛の 1 / 3 ，牛乳の 1 / 4 ，温州みかん，常用労働者給与の 1 / 5 ，はくさいの 1 / 6 であった．（ 6 ）自給粗飼料生産の家族労賃である，牧草・放牧・採草地に関する間接労働費を所得及び家族労働報酬に加算することによって収益性を修正し，零細規模子牛生産農家の存立理由を実証した．修正した 1 日当たり家族労働報酬は， 5 年平均値で修正前より 3. 8 倍も増加した．粗飼料生産に大きく依存する子牛生産の収益性分析においては，子牛生産に直接関わる飼育労働費とともに粗飼料生産に要する間接労働費も所得及び家族労働報酬に計上すべきである．（ 7 ）発展の阻害要因としては子牛価格の変動，「サシ」による肉質評価，粗飼料生産基盤の貧弱，土地集積の困難性及び低資本蓄積力のような規模拡大規制要因が多いこと，市場開設回数が少ないこと等がある．将来への発展方向として子牛価格支持政策の拡充，「サシ」による肉質評価の見直し，粗飼料流通化の推進，草地開発及び維持管理への財政援助，市場機構及び流通組織の改善，子牛生産の地域システム化，入会権の調整等があげられる...|$|E
40|$|The aim of our {{experiment}} {{was to compare}} the effect of different levels of the addition of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. c.) yeast culture on feed carrier to the current ration MK DOJ Levucell SC 20, Saccharomyces cerevisiae CNCM I- 1077 (E 1711) 20. 1010 CFU on the blood parameters of high-pregnant <b>breeding</b> <b>cows</b> and their calves. The experiment included 42 <b>breeding</b> <b>cows</b> of the Czech Fleckvieh cattle breed and their calves. The <b>breeding</b> <b>cows</b> {{were divided into two}} age groups, each of 21 heads. The first group included heifers and the second group consisted of cows on the 2 nd and higher lactation. Each age group had 7 control animals (Heifers/Cows – control), 7 animals receiving 50 g of yeast culture on the feed carrier per head and day (Heifers/Cows – 50 g), and 7 animals receiving 150 g of yeast culture on the feed carrier per head and day (Heifers/Cows – 150 g). Blood of the animals was sampled three times during the experiment – two times in the cows and one time in their calves. The first blood sample was taken from the <b>breeding</b> <b>cows</b> before the start of feeding the yeast culture ca. 23 days before the expected parturition (Cow − 23). The second blood sample was taken from the <b>breeding</b> <b>cows</b> within 24 hours after birth (Cow + 2) and the third blood sample was taken from the calves on the 3 rd– 4 th day after birth (Calf + 4). Parameters ascertained in the processed serum were: immunoglobulines G (IgG), crude protein (CP), gamma glutamyl-transferase (GGT), urea, glutamate-pyruvate-transaminase (GPT) and glutamate-oxaloacetate-transaminase (GOT). Results of our experiment, which lasted from 16. 3 to 28. 6 (105 days) showed IgG in the serum of cows on the 2 nd and higher lactation in the control group (3. 8 ± 1. 48 mg/ml) was statistically significantly lower (P < 0. 05) in the blood sample Cow + 2 than in the serum of cows in the 2 nd and higher lactation fed with the lower concentration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at the same sampling (15. 9 ± 11. 41 mg/ml). This correlates also {{with the fact that the}} content of IgG antibodies in the serum of calves after the cows on the 2 nd and higher lactation in the control group (3. 9 ± 2. 06 mg/ml) was statistically significantly (P < 0. 05) lower than that of calves after the cows on the 2 nd and higher lactation with the lower concentration of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (14. 6 ± 8. 67 [*]mg/[*]ml). As to the higher addition, no statistically significant difference of the effect on the IgG content was recorded (P < 0. 05) ...|$|R
