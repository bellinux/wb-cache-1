The magnetic fields around typical <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> systems are evaluated in this paper via numerical and experimental investigation. Galvanized iron enclosure of the <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> system is approximately modeled as a linear enclosure with a constant equivalent relative permeability. The modeling effectiveness is validated. It is found that the equivalent relative permeability is almost linearly proportional {{the magnitude of the}} carried current. Harmonic frequency magnetic fields are also discussed. Department of Building Services EngineeringRefereed conference pape...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of design of tap-off units of a <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> system in {{point of view of a}} heat loss. At first the issue of <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> systems as an alternitive to wires is {{presented}} in the thesis. Then there is a deep analysis of a design of a tap-off unit, including the issue of calculating the temperature-rise. For the design, a computer program was created, whose presentation makes up the cardial part of the thesis. Not only its parts are described, but also there is written how to work with it and which datas it uses. At last results of the design of the tap-off unit in the program are compared to the results of the type test of the temperature-rise...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to the use of heat energy from the busbar and its cooling system. The study deals with thermal analysis of the busbar, both using numerical simulations in SolidWorks and practical examination – warming of the busbar. We can verify the correctness of the simulation from the measured values. To determine the temperature profile of the busbar, it is necessary to measure the temperature at various points of the busbar by contact method using thermocouple or contactless method using a thermal imager. Measurements are performed at the busbar LIA 1600 made by Siemens <b>Busbar</b> <b>Trunking</b> System Mohelnice. The aim of the study is to analyze temperature busbar, to suggest the most efficient method of heat recovery, and to make economic calculatio...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} {{dedicated}} to the effect of surface modification on lid warming of <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> system BD 2 which is manufactured by Siemens company in Mohelnice town (CZ). By using experimental methods, it investigates heat transfer by radiation and natural convection. It evaluates which type of surface modification is more effective by transfer heat. This study uses a method of emisivity comparison and a procedure given in standards for heat up test afterwards. It led to recognition, that various colour shades used on busbar system have similar high emissivity. Smooth colour spraying transfers heat a bit more effectively than rough colour spraying. Outputs of supplementary measurements give basis for numerical simulations in SolidWorks software. Numerical analysis assists to interpret results, for example by sensitivity study of heat transfer depending on emissivity...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the low-frequency magnetic field generated from an unbalanced current source {{in the presence of a}} cylindrical shell. Analytical expressions of the magnetic field are given, as well as the shielding mechanism and shielding performance of the shell. The impulse magnetic field generated from a lightning discharge current in a coaxial cable is also addressed. It is not always correct that a conducting shell or enclosure is the panacea to shielding every kind of excitation. The shell may become a vain attempt at magnetic shielding if the source current is not balanced within the enclosure, such as the bend of a <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> system. The presence of the enclosure may only result in a change in the distribution of the magnetic field. Effective shielding is achieved if the monopole field from the source is cancelled. This can be realised by placing the returning-current filament internally or injecting the current in the shell. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|In modern {{developing}} world, ICT (Information and Communication Technology) usage {{is rapidly}} increasing and all commercial buildings comprise with very sensitive telecommunication equipments {{in order to}} facilitate day to day requirements. All such equipments are interconnected with network cable wiring system unless few remote operating equipments exist. On the other hand, building electrical wiring system is also laid throughout the building. In this context, it may have opportunity to interfere unwanted electrical noise to the data and voice systems hence malfunction or giving flaw data outputs. Electrical noise cause for an abnormal humming sound of the voice signals and thereby degrade the quality of sound systems. Such interference can happen due to both radiated and conductive electrical noise. One of major reasons for the conducted noise is, operation of switched mode power supplies hence lead to create of earth loops that should eliminate at the design and installation stages. Analysis of electrical noise in the system and design filtering systems need to be practiced, when noise issues are raised after the commissioning of electrical installations. It is required to do analyzing of electrical noise in the building in order to come across comprehensive conclusion for root cause for the disturbances. In doing so, harmonic levels, noise in the live wires, noise through the earth wire and earth loop possibilities are investigated. The most important part is to identify major frequency components filter those from the system. Different type of filter arrangements can be used to evaluate its performances against the noise level of the site. Similarly, installation guide lines can be followed prior to the site erection and that is the very effective method to avoid unnecessary noise induced in sensitive equipments. Though general filter arrangements eliminate noise, some frequency ranges need to be filtered separately, according to the site conditions. Since calculated L and C values can’t be exactly found out, next closet practical values were chosen thereby cutoff frequency is slightly shifted. Simulation results, for common mode noise filtering indicate, 106 Hz to 107 Hz minimal variation of cutoff frequency and 0. 03 variation in damping factor. Earth leakage currents drastically reduced with increasing of the earth line choke and that is possible way to control common mode noise. Introducing separate earth cables instead of single copper tape in the vertical <b>busbar</b> <b>trunking</b> system, is the elimination method of the earth loops between floors at far apart in the high rise building. Besides, it is required to use same earth termination point for the camera and the display system of the CCTV system in high rise buildings...|$|E
