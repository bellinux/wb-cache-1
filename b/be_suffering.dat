5000|$|In the Buddha's first discourse, Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta (SN 56.11), the Buddha is {{recorded}} as defining [...] "suffering" [...] (dukkha) {{in a manner}} that incorporates the first four remembrances: [...] "Birth <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> aging <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> sickness <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> death <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> association with the unpleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> dissociation from the pleasant <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> not to receive what one desires is suffering...." [...] This formula is reiterated throughout the Pali Canon.|$|R
5000|$|Now this, bhikkhus, is {{the noble}} truth of <b>suffering</b> dukkha: birth <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> aging <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> illness (byādhi) <b>is</b> <b>suffering,</b> death <b>is</b> suffering; union {{with what is}} displeasing is suffering; {{separation}} from what is pleasing is suffering; not to get what one wants is suffering; in brief, the five aggregates subject to clinging <b>are</b> <b>suffering.</b>|$|R
5|$|In {{qualifying}} Hamilton {{took his}} first pole position {{as part of a}} McLaren one-two. Heidfeld improved on his practice performance to take third position, in front of the Ferraris of Räikkönen and Massa. Massa shared the third row with Mark Webber, who did not seem to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> the same braking problem that almost put teammate David Coulthard out in the first session of qualifying, he had only one attempt at a lap in the second session as a result. Nico Rosberg, Robert Kubica, Giancarlo Fisichella and Jarno Trulli completed the top ten.|$|E
5|$|The dog conch is an {{economically}} important {{species in the}} Indo-West Pacific, and several studies indicate that it may <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> population declines due to overfishing and overexploitation. Malacologists and ecologists have recommended a reduction in its exploitation rate; initiatives in Thailand are attempting to ensure the possibility of reproduction in young-adult individuals and manage the natural populations in general. L.canarium demonstrates the imposex phenomenon, but is resistant to sterility caused by it; therefore, {{it has been suggested}} that this species might be useful as a bioindicator for organotin pollution monitoring near Malaysian ports.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> from {{rheumatism}} and therefore unfit for flying in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E

The agents head to Allentown, Pennsylvania to see Betsy Hagopian, a Mutual UFO Network member who was previously discovered to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> from similar symptoms. The agents learn that Betsy has died, yet find someone using her phone line. They trace the call to Kurt Crawford (David Lovgren), a fellow MUFON member. Crawford tells them that {{all but one of the}} MUFON members Scully previously met have died of cancer. Scully is skeptical of Mulder and Crawford's claims that a government conspiracy and her abduction are behind her illness.|$|E

5|$|Bramblestar's Storm, {{the seventh}} volume in the Super Edition arc, {{features}} Bramblestar, {{the leader of}} ThunderClan. The book takes place after the Clans' victory over the Dark Forest cats. This book was released on 26 August 2014. All Clans are struggling due to the lake flooding; however, ThunderClan and ShadowClan appear to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> most. Deaths of Clanmates leads to tension and grief between those in ThunderClan as they simultaneously also try to survive outside of their usual territory, having been displaced by the flooding. On a border patrol, Bramblestar encounters some housecats that are taken into the Clan until they can return home. Bramblestar becomes close {{to one of the}} housecats, Jessy, which upsets Bramblestar's deputy (and former mate) Squirrelflight causing many quarrels between them. Ultimately, two of the housecats, Minty and Jessy, decide to leave, leaving only Frankie (later named Stormpaw) with ThunderClan. Jessy leaves because she feels {{that it would be better}} if Bramblestar and herself do not become mates because Bramblestar’s heart belongs with Squirrelflight. In the short manga chapter included at the book's end, it is revealed that Squirrelflight is pregnant with Bramblestar's kits.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Calderon, Emily's {{doctor who}} works for a company called Prangen, refuses to {{transfer}} Emily's medical records to the County Children's Center, prompting Mulder to rough him up, but has to leave when security arrives. Later, Mulder follows Calderon after he leaves his office. Scully has imaging tests conducted on Emily. Calderon goes to see the Dark Suited Men, one of whom kills him by stabbing him in the neck with an alien stiletto; both men then morph into Calderon. Mulder follows as one of them leaves. The results of Emily's tests show her to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> from a tumorous infection. The other Calderon arrives at the hospital and injects Emily with an unknown green substance; he escapes by morphing into someone else. Scully believes that he is continuing the treatments, and the Sims were murdered because they were trying to stop him. Mulder follows the first Calderon clone into a building, where he meets Anna Fugazzi, an elderly woman in a nursing home.|$|E
5|$|Hess {{continued}} {{to be interested in}} aviation, learning to fly the more advanced aircraft that were coming into development at the start of World War II. On 10 May 1941 he undertook a solo flight to Scotland, where he hoped to arrange peace talks with the Duke of Hamilton, whom he believed to be prominent in opposition to the British government. Hess was immediately arrested on his arrival and was held in British custody {{until the end of the}} war, when he was returned to Germany to stand trial in the Nuremberg Trials of major war criminals in 1946. During much of the trial, he claimed to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> from amnesia, but later admitted this was a ruse. Hess was convicted of crimes against peace and conspiracy with other German leaders to commit crimes and was transferred to Spandau Prison in 1947, where he served a life sentence. Repeated attempts by family members and prominent politicians to win him early release were blocked by the Soviet Union. Still in custody in Spandau, he died by suicide in 1987 at the age of 93. After his death the prison was demolished to prevent it from becoming a neo-Nazi shrine.|$|E

5|$|In the 1920s, {{however, the}} son, Clarence, {{repeated}} {{the story and}} published a book in the United States, My Uncle George V, in which he claimed {{he was born in}} London in September 1890, about nine months after Albert Victor's meeting with Mrs. Haddon. In 1933, he was charged with demanding money with menace and attempted extortion after writing to the King asking for hush money. At his trial the following January, the prosecution produced documents showing that Haddon's enlistment papers, marriage certificate, officer's commission, demobilisation papers and employment records all showed he was born in or before 1887, at least two years before Albert Victor met Mrs. Haddon. Haddon was found guilty and the judge, believing Haddon to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> from delusions, did not jail him but bound him over for three years on the condition that he made no claim that he was Albert Victor's son. Haddon breached the conditions and was jailed for a year. Dismissed as a crank, he died a broken man. Even if Haddon's claim had been true, as with other royal illegitimacies, it would have made no difference to the royal line of succession.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{brings the}} device to the Lone Gunmen, who tell him it is {{emitting}} some kind of signal. Mulder contacts Scully, who is growing increasingly paranoid. Hearing possible clicks while {{on the phone with}} Mulder, she frantically searches her hotel room for monitoring devices. When Mulder knocks at her door, Scully fires her weapon at it and runs off. Mulder believes her to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> from paranoid psychosis. The Lone Gunmen believe {{the device to}} be some sort of subliminal mind control device. Mulder was not affected due to his color blindness. The police find a body they believe to be that of Scully, but Mulder confirms that it is not her. Mulder is unable to contact Scully's mother, leading him to go to her house. He finds Scully there, who aims a gun at him. Scully claims Mulder never trusted her and blames him for her abduction and her sister's murder. Scully's mother calms her down, and she is hospitalized.|$|E
5|$|The two 20th Century Fox films—The Hound of the Baskervilles and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes—had survived {{complete}} {{and in good}} condition, but those in the Universal series suffered badly over the years, as they passed through the hands of different copyright owners. In 1993 the UCLA Film and Television Archive started a restoration project on the series after the unstable cellulose nitrate film was found to <b>be</b> <b>suffering</b> from deterioration. Restoration on the first six films—The Woman in Green, The Pearl of Death, Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon, The Scarlet Claw, Terror by Night and The Spider Woman—took four years from 1993; the costs for the restoration were met by UCLA and Hugh Hefner, who was {{a fan of the}} Rathbone-Holmes series. From 1998 Warner Bros. matched Hefner's funding and the remaining six films—Dressed to Kill, Pursuit to Algiers, Sherlock Holmes Faces Death, The House of Fear, Sherlock Holmes and the Voice of Terror and Sherlock Holmes in Washington—were then restored, a process that was completed in 2001.|$|E
