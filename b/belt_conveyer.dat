On the basis of evaluative criteria of the standard mentioned above, vibrations of a <b>belt</b> <b>conveyer</b> were measured.

Consequential experimental measurements for verification of vibrations confirmed that application of pneumatic flexible coupling resulted in decrease of vibrations by 60 %.

40|$|Purpose. A {{drive is}} one of the basic {{elements}} of belt conveyers. To determine the drive power it is necessary to conduct calculations by standard methodologies expounded in modern technical literature. Such calculations demand a fair amount of time. The basic design parameters of a <b>belt</b> <b>conveyer</b> include type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions. The article aims to build the parametric dependence of <b>belt</b> <b>conveyer</b> drive power on its design parameters, that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of belts, idlers and pulleys. Methodology. The work examines a <b>belt</b> <b>conveyer</b> with two areas: sloping and horizontal. Using the methodology for pulling calculation by means of <b>belt</b> <b>conveyer</b> encirclement, there are built parametric dependences of pull forces in the characteristic conveyer path points on the type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions. Findings. For the belt conveyers of the considered type there are built parametric dependences of drive power on type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions, taking into account the belt standard dimensions and corresponding assumptions in relation to idler and pulley types. Originality. This is the first developed parametric dependence of two-area (sloping and horizontal) <b>belt</b> <b>conveyer</b> drive power on type of load, design efficiency, geometrical dimensions and path configuration, operation conditions that takes into account standard dimensions and parameters of belts, idlers and pulleys. Practical value. Use of the built drive power dependences on design parameters for the belt conveyers with sloping and horizontal areas gives an opportunity of relatively rapid determination of drive power approximate value at the design stage. Also it allows quality selection of its basic elements at specific design characteristics and requirements. The offered dependences can be used for determination of general character of drive power dependence on the project efficiency. ...|$|E

40|$|Two main modules for {{material}} handling tasks in production lines are belt conveyers and AGVs (Autonomous Guided Vehicles). Belt conveyers have good performance with efficiency {{but they do}} not have flexibility against layout changes of the production lines. On the other hand, AGVs have contrary characteristics. Therefore we need transporting modules that have both efficiency and flexibility. We propose the AGV modules with the <b>belt</b> <b>conveyer</b> (Fig. 1). Fig. 2 shows the photograph of the proposed modules. Two demands can be realized with the cooperation of these modules. Three kinds of cooperation can be considered: (a) Full AGV system: each AGV moves independently and hands over a transported object to/from nearby modules. (b) Hybrid system: several AGVs are connected each other, and move as large AGVs.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) In {{the field}} of bulk solid {{materials}} handling, belt conveyor systems {{play an important role}} in the productivity of mines, ports and processing plants. A vast range of bulk solid materials are handled and understanding the influence of their characteristics on the interactions throughout the system is critical to ensuring performance and reliability. Integral areas of <b>belt</b> <b>conveying</b> systems include transportation, discharge, re-direction, transfer, loading and acceleration of bulk solid materials. In all of these areas, bulk solid interactions occur within the material itself, with the conveyor belt and the encompassing environment. To date, techniques used to investigate bulk solid material interactions in <b>belt</b> <b>conveying</b> systems have been based on classical engineering mechanics and conventional continuum “lump” based analyses. These analyses traditionally rely on bulk solid material properties which are extracted from standardised tests and measurement procedures. Based on a determined set of parameters describing the characteristic nature of the bulk solid material handled, existing theoretical approaches are presented and applied in the analysis of the belt conveyor system. Testing procedures for the determination of these parameters are also presented. In contrast, Discrete Element Modelling (DEM) analysis focuses on the intrinsic constituents (individual particles) that effectively make up the “lump” and allows a more detailed investigation into such interactions. Due to the dissociation between existing standardised tests and measurement of parameters required for DEM analysis, calibration techniques are developed from which a set of characterising parameters of the modelled bulk solid material may be obtained. A number of calibration tests implemented for the selection of characterising modelling parameters are applied and presented with results compared to laboratory and full scale tests. Following selection of DEM parameters, an in-depth study of each area of bulk solid interactions in <b>belt</b> <b>conveying</b> systems is presented. The work embodied in this thesis will investigate and evaluate the existing theoretical approaches through the application of continuum mechanics and DEM, both individually and in combination. Laboratory experiments, full scale tests and site observations are used to validate the analyses presented...|$|R

It analyzed the effect of stiffness and damping of belt on the starting process by dynamic characteristics simulation method. The simulation results showed that the speed wave period of belt with the smaller stiffness was longer and the peak was bigger, the belt speed easily occurred stronger surge, the transverse vibration of belt conveyor became more violent. With the increasing of stiffness, the belt speed wave peak value decreased. As the same time, the speed surge also decreased when other operation parameters of the <b>belt</b> <b>conveyer</b> system are fixed, with increasing of the damping, the dynamic tension force peak became smaller gradually, it led to decrease of vibration curve peak.
