5|$|Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is a {{group of}} {{diseases}} that affect a dog's eyesight and can lead to <b>blindness.</b> It has been documented in a large number of different dog breeds including both the American and English Cocker Spaniels. The two types of Cockers are susceptible to a specific type of PRA called Progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), symptoms include night <b>blindness</b> leading to total <b>blindness</b> between the ages of three and five. PRCD is the most widespread hereditary retinal disease which may lead to <b>blindness</b> in dogs.|$|E
5|$|Human {{eyes have}} color receptors known as cone cells, {{of which there}} are three types. In some cases, one is missing or faulty, which can cause color <b>blindness,</b> {{including}} the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green, known as deuteranopia or redgreen color <b>blindness.</b> Green is restful to the eye. Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue.|$|E
5|$|Skiers {{with visual}} {{impairment}} including <b>blindness,</b> low visual acuity, and limited field of vision.|$|E
5|$|Visually Impaired: Athletes {{with vision}} {{impairment}} ranging from partial vision, sufficient {{to be judged}} legally blind, to total <b>blindness.</b>|$|E
5|$|On {{his lunch}} break he brings the girl {{groceries}} while her grandmother is out selling flowers. To entertain her he reads a newspaper aloud; {{in it is}} a story about a Viennese doctor's <b>blindness</b> cure.|$|E
5|$|Rabbinic {{literature}} also linked Isaac's <b>blindness</b> in old age, {{as stated}} in the Bible, to the sacrificial binding: Isaac's eyes went blind because the tears of angels present {{at the time of his}} sacrifice fell on Isaac's eyes.|$|E
5|$|This in turn {{blocks the}} flow of fluids in the eye, leading to a painful {{increase}} in intra-ocular pressure (glaucoma) and often irreparable optic nerve damage, leading to visual field loss and eventual <b>blindness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arya Stark, now blinded, {{is sent to}} beg on the streets. The Waif {{suddenly}} appears {{and forces}} Arya to duel her using a wooden staff. Arya fails because of her <b>blindness,</b> and the Waif promises that she will return the following day.|$|E
5|$|Cataracts {{can affect}} any breed of dog {{and is the}} same {{condition}} as seen in humans. Here {{the lens of the}} eye hardens and is characterised by cloudiness in the eye. Cataracts will blur the dog's vision and can lead to permanent <b>blindness</b> if left untreated. While considered mainly a hereditary disease, it can also be caused by diabetes, old age, radiation, eye injury or exposure to high temperatures.|$|E
5|$|In January 2011, she {{revealed}} {{her struggle}} with chronic iritis {{that had caused}} temporary <b>blindness</b> in one eye. Some months earlier she had surgery that had corrected the problem. Kunis also has heterochromia iridum, {{a condition in which}} the irises are different colors. One eye (left) is brown, and the other (right) is green.|$|E
5|$|In October 2015, Bush was conferred {{an honorary}} Doctor of Letters degree from Wayland Baptist University in {{recognition}} of her longtime advocacy on behalf of education, health care and human rights following an address she gave on the university's campus. November, she received the 2015 Prevent <b>Blindness</b> Person of Vision Award.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{had several}} health problems, {{including}} childhood tuberculous scrofula resulting in deep facial scarring, deafness {{in one ear}} and <b>blindness</b> in one eye, gout, testicular cancer, and a stroke in his final year that left him unable to speak; his autopsy indicated that he had pulmonary fibrosis along with cardiac failure probably due to hypertension, a condition then unknown. Johnson displayed signs consistent with several diagnoses, including depression and Tourette syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{spitting}} cobras, {{this species}} {{is known for}} its ability to project venom at a potential threat. The venom is an irritant to the skin and eyes. If it enters the eyes, symptoms include extreme burning pain, loss of coordination, partial loss of vision, and permanent <b>blindness.</b> N. nigricollis {{is known for its}} tendency to liberally spit venom and bite with only the slightest provocation.|$|E
5|$|On one {{occasion}} {{while he was}} bathing in the Saigon River, Nao decided to inspect the sewer tunnel which his father had advised him to use. Nao concluded that the tunnel would provide {{the best way to}} get in and out of the American area, but using it also presented challenges. The sewerage tunnel contained both wastes and toxic oils which could cause <b>blindness,</b> so Nao and his men would have to close their eyes as they move through the tunnel, in order to avoid <b>blindness.</b> Furthermore, Nao and his men must wash their bodies to get rid of the deadly odours to avoid detection, and probably arrest, by South Vietnamese authorities. After Nao had surveyed the tunnels which lead into the port, he presented his plan of attack to the Saigon-Gia Dinh Military District Headquarters. Nao decided to utilise high explosives, enough to sink a ship, and detonate it using a timer so that his men could get away safely. Naoâ€™s superiors approved the plan, and they ordered him to launch the attack before sunrise to avoid killing local Vietnamese civilians.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} may regress spontaneously, {{but should}} the disease progress beyond a threshold (defined as five contiguous or eight cumulative hours of stage 3 retinopathy of prematurity), both cryosurgery and laser surgery {{have been shown}} {{to reduce the risk of}} <b>blindness</b> as an outcome. Where the disease has progressed further, techniques such as scleral buckling and vitrectomy surgery may assist in re-attaching the retina.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog {{is one of}} the dog breeds {{affected}} by progressive retinal atrophy. It has the most common form, progressive rod-cone degeneration (PRCD), a condition that causes the rods and cones in the retina of the eye to deteriorate later in life, resulting in <b>blindness.</b> PRCD is an autosomal recessive trait and a dog can be a carrier of the affected gene without developing the condition.|$|E
5|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of IIH is {{the prevention of}} visual loss and <b>blindness,</b> as well as symptom control. IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and, where applicable, weight loss. IIH may resolve after initial treatment, may go into spontaneous remission (although it can still relapse at a later stage), or may continue chronically.|$|E
5|$|Another {{leading cause}} of <b>blindness</b> is Canine glaucoma. This is an {{increase}} in the pressure of the fluid in the eye which, if left untreated, can cause visual impairment and eventual loss of sight. The condition can be inherited (Primary glaucoma) or a secondary condition to a variety of other eye issues including tumors or lens luxation. Both breeds are affected by juvenile cataracts which can occur at up to four years of age. Symptoms can include discoloring of the pupil, and treatment may include surgery to remove the cataract.|$|E
5|$|As {{with dogs}} from other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is {{energetic}} and intelligent with an independent streak. It responds well to structured training, {{particularly if it}} is interesting and challenging. It was originally bred to herd by biting, and is known to nip running children. It forms a strong attachment to its owners, and can be protective of them and their possessions. It is easy to groom and maintain, requiring little more than brushing during the shedding period. The most common health problems are deafness and progressive <b>blindness</b> (both hereditary conditions) and accidental injury; otherwise, it is a robust breed with a lifespan of 12 to 14 years.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman had thought of going to the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank of corporal. At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal <b>blindness).</b> The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the high}} {{reactivity}} of the metal, toxicological data are available only for compounds. Water-soluble barium compounds are poisonous. In low doses, barium ions act as a muscle stimulant, and higher doses affect the nervous system, causing cardiac irregularities, tremors, weakness, anxiety, shortness of breath, and paralysis. This toxicity {{may be caused by}} Ba2+ blocking potassium ion channels, which are critical to the proper function of the nervous system. Other organs damaged by water-soluble barium compounds (i.e., barium ions) are the eyes, immune system, heart, respiratory system, and skin causing, for example, <b>blindness</b> and sensitization.|$|E
5|$|Cats are obligate carnivores: their {{physiology}} {{has evolved}} to efficiently process meat, {{and they have}} difficulty digesting plant matter. In contrast to omnivores such as rats, which only require about 4% protein in their diet, about 20% of a cat's diet must be protein. Cats are unusually dependent on a constant supply of the amino acid arginine, and a diet lacking arginine causes marked weight loss and can be rapidly fatal. Another unusual feature is that the cat cannot produce taurine, with taurine deficiency causing macular degeneration, wherein the cat's retina slowly degenerates, causing irreversible <b>blindness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Clark left Cambridge {{at the age}} of 18 to {{join the}} Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as an officer. During initial {{training}} at HMS Collingwood, near Portsmouth, Clark discovered that he was colour blind and only passed the medical examination by persuading the man sitting behind him to whisper the answers to him. Clark served aboard HMS Fleetwood on convoy escort operations in the Atlantic and Mediterranean before attending HMS King Alfred at Hove. Whilst there his colour <b>blindness</b> was discovered and he was banned from seagoing postings.|$|E
5|$|During an 11-month {{period of}} <b>blindness</b> in 1902, List became {{increasingly}} interested in occultism, in particular coming {{under the influence}} of the Theosophical Society, resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic beliefs to incorporate Runology and the Armanen Futharkh. The popularity of his work among the vÃ¶lkisch and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.|$|E
5|$|During {{his service}} at headquarters, Hitler pursued his artwork, drawing {{cartoons}} and instructions for an army newspaper. During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916, {{he was wounded}} in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners' dugout. Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at Beelitz, returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917. On 15 October 1918, he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in Pasewalk. While there, Hitler learned of Germany's defeat, andâ€”by his own accountâ€”upon receiving this news, he suffered a second bout of <b>blindness.</b>|$|E
5|$|Fibropapillomatosis disease {{caused by}} a form of the herpes-type virus threatens loggerheads with {{internal}} and external tumors. These tumors disrupt essential behaviors and, if on the eyes, cause permanent <b>blindness.</b> Trematodes of the family Spirorchiidae inhabit tissues throughout {{the body of the}} loggerhead, including vital organs, such as the heart and the brain. Trematode infection can be highly debilitating. For example, inflammatory trematode lesions can cause endocarditis and neurological disease. A nematode, Angiostoma carettae, also infects loggerheads, causing histologic lesions in the respiratory tract.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including <b>blindness.</b> The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} (MS) is a {{demyelinating disease}} {{in which the}} insulating covers of nerve cells {{in the brain and}} spinal cord are damaged. This damage disrupts the ability of parts of the nervous system to communicate, resulting in a range of signs and symptoms, including physical, mental, and sometimes psychiatric problems. Specific symptoms can include double vision, <b>blindness</b> in one eye, muscle weakness, trouble with sensation, or trouble with coordination. MS takes several forms, with new symptoms either occurring in isolated attacks (relapsing forms) or building up over time (progressive forms). Between attacks, symptoms may disappear completely; however, permanent neurological problems often remain, especially as the disease advances.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (<b>blindness,</b> cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} the only area where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} following acute carbon monoxide poisoning is the severe delayed neurological manifestations that may occur. Problems may include difficulty with higher intellectual functions, short-term memory loss, dementia, amnesia, psychosis, irritability, a strange gait, speech disturbances, Parkinson's disease-like syndromes, cortical <b>blindness,</b> and a depressed mood. Depression may occur in {{those who did not}} have pre-existing depression. These delayed neurological sequelae may occur in up to 50% of poisoned people after 2 to 40 days. It is difficult to predict who will develop delayed sequelae; however, advanced age, loss of consciousness while poisoned, and initial neurological abnormalities may increase the chance of developing delayed symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Retinopathy of {{prematurity}} was {{not observed}} before World War II, but with the availability of supplemental oxygen in the decade following, it rapidly {{became one of the}} principal causes of infant <b>blindness</b> in developed countries. By 1960 the use of oxygen had become identified as a risk factor and its administration restricted. The resulting fall in retinopathy of prematurity was accompanied by a rise in infant mortality and hypoxia-related complications. Since then, more sophisticated monitoring and diagnosis have established protocols for oxygen use which aim to balance between hypoxic conditions and problems of retinopathy of prematurity.|$|E
5|$|Systemic {{symptoms}} {{resulting from}} anaphylaxis can be dramatic. These may appear within 5 minutes post bite, {{or can be}} delayed for many hours. Such symptoms include nausea, retching and vomiting, abdominal colic and diarrhoea, incontinence of urine and faeces, sweating, fever, vasoconstriction, tachycardia, lightheadedness, loss of consciousness, <b>blindness,</b> shock, angioedema of the face, lips, gums, tongue, throat and epiglottis, urticaria and bronchospasm. If left untreated, these symptoms may persist or fluctuate for up to 48 hours. In severe cases, cardiovascular failure may occur.|$|E
5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river <b>blindness,</b> and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to the AIDS epidemic. The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E
5|$|The {{effect of}} mercury {{took some time}} â€“ the latent period between {{ingestion}} and the first symptoms (typically paresthesia â€“ numbness in the extremities) was between 16 and 38 days. Paresthesia was the predominant symptom in less serious cases. Worse cases included ataxia (typically loss of balance), <b>blindness</b> or reduced vision, and death resulting from central nervous system failure. Anywhere between 20 and 40mg of mercury has been suggested as sufficient for paresthesia (between 0.5 and 0.8mg/kg of body weight). On average, individuals affected consumed 20kg or so of bread; the 73,000 tonnes provided would have been sufficient for over 3 million cases.|$|E
5|$|The touch was {{originally}} meant to cure tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis (commonly {{referred to as}} scrofula or the King's Evil), rheumatism, convulsions, fevers, <b>blindness,</b> goitre and other ailments. Since the reign of Elizabeth I (r. 1558â€“1603), however, the touch was applied only to people suffering from scrofula. The Henrician practice was rarely modified, and the changes were minor; Elizabeth I {{made the sign of}} the cross above the infected person's head, while her squeamish successor, James I (r. 1603â€“1625), made stroking motions above the abscesses instead of actually touching them.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} eating a certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver {{to a person}} may help with night <b>blindness,</b> an illness now known {{to be caused by}} a vitamin A deficiency. The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to fresh fruits and vegetables, and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships' crews.|$|E
