5|$|Bermuda {{dispatched}} six {{athletes in}} total to the Beijing Olympics. Of the delegation, {{two of the}} athletes (Roy-Allen Burch and Tyrone Smith) were men and four of the athletes (Flora Duffy, Kiera Aitken, Arantxa King, and Jill Terceira) were women. King was the youngest <b>Bermudian</b> participant during the 2008 Olympics, at 18 years of age, and Terceira was the oldest, at 37. No <b>Bermudian</b> athlete advanced to a final round during the 2008 Games.|$|E
5|$|Bermuda's {{debut in}} the Olympic Games began with the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin, Nazi Germany, when the <b>Bermudian</b> {{delegation}} included five athletes, all men. Bermuda had appeared in twenty-one Olympic Games between 1936 and the 2008 Beijing Olympics, excluding the 1980 Summer Olympics. Of those twenty-one games, sixteen of them were Summer Olympics. Bermuda had, prior to Beijing, earned one medal, when Clarence Hill won bronze in the 1976 Summer Olympics. The 2008 <b>Bermudian</b> delegation had fewer people than it usually sent abroad, prompting {{the president of the}} <b>Bermudian</b> Olympic Association Austin Woods to complain publicly that the year's Olympic team lacked access to quality coaches, administrators, and facilities, and with the exception of several athletes, lacked the skill to be competitive.|$|E
5|$|Goater {{has also}} {{played for the}} <b>Bermudian</b> {{national}} team 36 times, scoring 32 goals, though due to Bermuda's lowly standing in world football he never played in a major international tournament. He made his first international appearance {{at the age of}} 17 against Canada.|$|E

50|$|Bermuda {{being an}} island {{with a history}} of sailing and a number of sailing clubs, it is no {{surprise}} that sailing has been historically a popular sport. Namely, dinghy racing is seen as the main competitive sport. Unsurprisingly, most <b>Bermudians</b> swim, and <b>Bermudians</b> compete in swimming competitions in the Caribbean. <b>Bermudians</b> also enjoy non-competitive sports like diving and fishing.|$|R
5000|$|African <b>Bermudians</b> or <b>Bermudians</b> of African descent are <b>Bermudians</b> whose ancestry {{lies within}} the {{continent}} of Africa. The population descented from Black Africans, exported to Bermuda as slaves. Some Black <b>Bermudians</b> were Free Blacks who chose to immigrate to the island to work as indentured servants during the 17th century. By the 19th century the Black population surpassed the White population and became Bermudas largest ethnic group, which was initially classed as being [...] "Coloured" [...] alongside all other non-white ethnicities of Bermuda. [...] "Black Bermudian" [...] became a recognised ethnic group in Bermuda in the 20th century, by which time {{it was the largest}} ethnic group on the island.|$|R
5|$|The red-billed tropicbird, a bird not {{indigenous}} to Bermuda, was displayed in error on the $50 <b>Bermudian</b> dollar {{and was replaced}} in 2012 by the white-tailed tropicbird, the tropicbird {{that can be found}} in Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|Goater {{was born}} in the <b>Bermudian</b> capital Hamilton, living with his mother Lynette, his {{grandmother}} and two aunts. His introduction to English football came in April 1987 when he was invited to join the Saltus Grammar School football and basketball tour. He spent two weeks playing against various English high school teams, including the Leicester City youth team. At the age of 17, he left home to further his education in the United States, where he had a soccer scholarship at Columbia High School, New Jersey. Whilst home in Bermuda during his Thanksgiving break, Goater was spotted by scouts from Manchester United, who invited him to England for a trial. With encouragement from his mother, who was a former football player herself, Goater accepted, forfeiting his scholarship by doing so. At this time, Goater did not play as a striker, but instead played as a creative midfielder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bermudian</b> Springs School District {{operates}} three schools: <b>Bermudian</b> Springs Elementary School, <b>Bermudian</b> Springs Middle School and <b>Bermudian</b> Springs High School. <b>Bermudian</b> Springs School District {{is served}} by the Lincoln Intermediate Unit 12 which {{offers a variety of}} services, including curriculum development assistance, shared services, a group purchasing program and a wide variety of special education and special needs services.|$|E
25|$|The close economic, family, and {{historical}} ties ensured <b>Bermudians</b> were strongly sympathetic with the rebels {{at the start}} of the War. They supplied the rebels illegally with ships, salt and gunpowder. As the war progressed, economic realities caused <b>Bermudians</b> to seize opportunities; they turned to privateering against the Americans.|$|R
50|$|In {{the twentieth}} century, those with {{any degree of}} sub-Saharan African ancestry (which was {{virtually}} everyone who had been defined as coloured) were redefined as Black, with Asian and other non-White <b>Bermudians</b> defined by separate racial groups (although it also, in that century, ceased to be the practice to record race on birth or other records). On Census returns, only in recent years have <b>Bermudians</b> been given the option to define themselves by more than one race, although there was considerable opposition to this from many Black leaders who discouraged Black <b>Bermudians</b> from doing so.|$|R
5000|$|By example, <b>Bermudians</b> {{will always}} say St. George's and St. David's {{are the largest}} islands in St. George's Parish, and never St. George and St. David are the largest islands in St. George Parish. As many maps and other printed {{materials}} featuring Bermuda are produced abroad, it is extremely common to find maps, books and other material using the non-possessive forms, but visitors to Bermuda {{should be aware that}} using the non-possessive forms when speaking to <b>Bermudians</b> is likely to cause as much offence as saying [...] "Bermudan" [...] (although <b>Bermudians,</b> who pride themselves on politeness, are unlikely to respond rudely).|$|R
25|$|<b>Bermudian</b> Springs School District {{is located}} along Pennsylvania Route 94 (Carlisle Pike) outside of York Springs. The District operates: <b>Bermudian</b> Springs High School, <b>Bermudian</b> Springs Middle School and <b>Bermudian</b> Springs Elementary School. Prior to the {{construction}} of the current elementary school, the district oversaw elementary schools in the Boroughs of East Berlin and York Springs. <b>Bermudian</b> Springs High School underwent a major renovation project that was completed in March 2008.|$|E
25|$|In 1970 {{the country}} {{switched}} its currency from the <b>Bermudian</b> pound to the <b>Bermudian</b> dollar, which is pegged at {{par with the}} US dollar. US notes and coins are used interchangeably with <b>Bermudian</b> notes and coins within the islands for most practical purposes; however, banks levy an exchange rate fee {{for the purchase of}} US dollars with <b>Bermudian</b> dollars. <b>Bermudian</b> notes carry the image of Queen Elizabeth II. The Bermuda Monetary Authority is the issuing authority for all banknotes and coins, and regulates financial institutions. The Royal Naval Dockyard Museum holds a permanent exhibition of Bermuda notes and coins.|$|E
25|$|As of May 2013, {{the four}} Uyghurs {{still lived in}} Bermuda; {{but they have not}} been given <b>Bermudian</b> status and remain stateless, posing {{problems}} for emergency medical situations and finding certain jobs. However, granting them <b>Bermudian</b> status would require a change in <b>Bermudian</b> laws, and the issue has prompted a major debate within Bermuda's parliament on what steps should be taken.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bermudians</b> rapidly {{abandoned}} agriculture for shipbuilding, replanting farmland {{with the}} native juniper (Juniperus bermudiana, called Bermuda cedar) trees that grew thickly {{over the entire}} island. Establishing effective control over the Turks Islands, <b>Bermudians</b> deforested their landscape to begin the salt trade. It became the world's largest and remained the cornerstone of Bermuda's economy for the next century.|$|R
25|$|Following this, the Bahamians {{were slow}} {{to return to the}} Turks, while the <b>Bermudians</b> quickly resumed salt production, sending sixty to seventy-five ships to the Turks each year, during the six months that salt could be raked. Nearly a {{thousand}} <b>Bermudians</b> spent part of the year on the Turks engaged in salt production, and the industry became more productive.|$|R

25|$|In May 2009, <b>Bermudian</b> Government's {{application}} was approved {{to become a}} contributory member of the University of the West Indies (UWI). Bermuda's membership enabled <b>Bermudian</b> students to enter the University at an agreed upon subsidised rate by 2010. UWI also agreed that their Open Campus (online degree courses) would become open to <b>Bermudian</b> students in the future, with Bermuda becoming the 13th country {{to have access to}} the Open Campus.|$|E

2500|$|A former clerk, {{probably}} from St. George's, Simmons joined the 54th on March 12, 1863. Many {{black and white}} <b>Bermudians</b> fought for the Union, mostly in the US Navy.

Harris, of the 6th Coloured Infantry, and George Smith. [...] Many other <b>Bermudians,</b> like Thomas Leslie Outerbridge, profiteered from the war by smuggling arms to the blockaded South.) ...|$|R
50|$|This {{overlooks the}} resentment felt by most Black <b>Bermudians</b> over {{a history of}} racial repression, segregation, discrimination, and {{marginalisation}} that continued long after slavery, and that did not distinguish between black and bi/multi-racial <b>Bermudians.</b> With the increasingly racially divisive politics that have followed {{the election of the}} PLP government, as well as the decades of increasing costs-of-living, the exclusion of unskilled workers from jobs in the white collar international business sector that has come to dominate Bermuda's economy, and the global economic downturn, all of which many Black <b>Bermudians</b> perceive as hitting them hardest, there is little sentiment today amongst people who have long been obliged {{to think of themselves as}} Black, in opposition to being White, to identify even partly with their European ancestry. Additionally, most multi-racial <b>Bermudians</b> do not today result from having parents of different races, but inherit diverse ancestry via many generations of mixed-race forebears, all of whom may be assumed to have been themselves entirely of Black African ancestry.|$|R
25|$|This {{ensured that}} the guiding hands on shaping the colony's society and economy were <b>Bermudian</b> ones. Although the British Government {{retained}} theoretical control via the appointed Governor, the real power in Bermuda remained with the wealthy <b>Bermudian</b> merchant families who dominated the economy, and filled the benches of the House of Assembly and the Privy Council, with the President of the Privy Council being undoubtedly the <b>Bermudian</b> with the greatest political power.|$|E

50|$|On the {{declaration}} of War in 1914, the BMA was already embodied for annual training and moved onto a war footing. The BVRC embodied, and both units took up their wartime roles.

25|$|When the <b>Bermudian</b> sloop Seaflower {{was seized}} by the Bahamians in 1701, the {{response}} of Bermuda Governor Bennett was to issue letters of marque to <b>Bermudian</b> Privateers. In 1706, Spanish and French forces ousted the Bermudians, but were driven out themselves three years later by a <b>Bermudian</b> privateer {{under the command of}} Captain Lewis Middleton in what was probably Bermuda's only independent military operation. His ship, the Rose, attacked a Spanish and a French privateer holding a captive English vessel. Defeating the two enemy vessels, the Rose then cleared out the thirty-man garrison left by the Spanish and French.|$|E

50|$|Saltus Grammar School, {{founded in}} 1888, is an {{independent}} school in Hamilton, the capital of Bermuda. It was a boys' school until 1992, when it became co-educational.

In 2005 it had some 1033 students, of whom 73% were <b>Bermudians.</b> Now, it has some 900 students, of whom 69% are <b>Bermudians.</b>|$|R

25|$|After the {{uncovering}} of a coup-plot by Irish {{laborers and}} Black slaves, however, further emigration of Irish servants was banned. The slave trade would be outlawed in Bermuda in 1807, and all slaves were freed in 1834. At {{the end of}} the 17th century, whites composed the majority of Bermuda's population. Blacks and Native Americans were both small minorities. They combined, however, absorbing the Irish and Scots, and no small part of the White English bloodline, to be described as a single demographic group a century later, with the Bermuda's population being divided into White and Black <b>Bermudians.</b> As 10,000 <b>Bermudians</b> had emigrated, prior to American independence, most of them White, this left Blacks with a slight majority. Portuguese immigration, which began with a shipload of Madeiran families in the 1840s has been offset by sustained immigration from the West Indies which began at {{the end of the}} 19th century. Today, about 60% of <b>Bermudians</b> are described as being of African descent, although many may have greater European ancestry, and almost all <b>Bermudians</b> would be able to easily find ancestors and relatives of either African or European descent.|$|R
