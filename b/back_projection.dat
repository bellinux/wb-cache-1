5|$|After the {{unexpected}} loss of Armendáriz, production proceeded, experiencing complications from uncredited rewrites by Berkely Mather during filming. Editor Peter Hunt set about editing the film while key elements were {{still to be}} filmed, helping to restructure the opening scenes. Hunt and Young conceived of moving the Red Grant training sequence {{to the beginning of}} the film (prior to the main title), a signature feature that has been an enduring hallmark of every Bond film since. The briefing with Blofeld was rewritten, and <b>back</b> <b>projection</b> was used to re-film Lotte Lenya's lines.|$|E
25|$|With both {{of these}} phase-extraction methods {{tomography}} is applicable by rotating the sample around the tomographic axis, recording a series of images with different projection angles and using <b>back</b> <b>projection</b> algorithms to reconstruct the 3-dimensional distributions of the real and imaginary part of the refractive index.|$|E
25|$|The {{reconstruction}} {{is accomplished}} by a two-step process, first images are aligned to account for errors in the positioning of a sample; such errors can occur due to vibration or mechanical drift. Alignment methods use image registration algorithms, such as autocorrelation methods to correct these errors. Secondly, using a reconstruction algorithm, such as filtered <b>back</b> <b>projection,</b> the aligned image slices can be transformed from a set of two-dimensional images, I'j(x,y), to a single three-dimensional image, Ij(x,y,z). This three-dimensional image {{is of particular interest}} when morphological information is required, further study can be undertaken using computer algorithms, such as isosurfaces and data slicing to analyse the data.|$|E

25|$|This move {{to better}} {{technical}} facilities, but much smaller studios, allowed Newsroom and News Review to replace <b>back</b> <b>projection</b> with Colour-separation overlay.

During the 1960s, satellite communication had become possible, however colour field-store standards converters were still in their infancy in 1968, and it was some years before digital line-store conversion was able to undertake the process seamlessly.|$|E

[...] However, shot noise in the raw data is prominent in the reconstructed images and areas of high tracer uptake tend to form streaks across the image. [...] Also, FBP treats the data deterministically—it does not account for the inherent randomness associated with PET data, thus requiring all the pre-reconstruction corrections described above.|$|E

40|$|Incompleteness and {{background}} are two important types of variance found in images of objects. It {{has been proposed}} that a bidirectional network within the visual cortex allows organisms {{to cope with this}} variability. In this thesis, the problems of incompleteness {{and background}} are defined in detail and various bidirectional (feed- forward and back-projecting) network solutions are proposed and discussed. Three experiments were performed to investigate how such a network might recognize objects which are incomplete or backgrounded. In the first experiment, spatial and temporal manipulations of illusory contours are used to test the hypothesis that a bidirectional network is responsible for illusory contour formation. In the second experiment, incomplete and backgrounded versions of the same object are studied to test the hypothesis that the real purpose of neural <b>back</b> <b>projections</b> is segmentation rather than object completion. And, in the third experiment, novel camouflage objects are used to study the ability or inability of the brain to learn new object representations, when the brain is without the benefit of active <b>back</b> <b>projections...</b>|$|R

This formula means that the phase shift is the projection of the decrement of the real part of the refractive index in imaging direction. This fulfills the requirement of the tomographic principle, which states that [...] "the input data to the reconstruction algorithm should be a projection of a quantity f that conveys structural information inside a sample. Then, one can obtain a tomogram which maps the value f." [...] In other words, in phase-contrast imaging {{a map of the}} real part of the refraction index [...] can be reconstructed with standard techniques like filtered <b>back</b> <b>projection</b> which is analog to conventional X-ray computed tomography where a map of the imaginary part of the refraction index can be retrieved.|$|E
2500|$|As TEM samples cannot {{typically}} {{be viewed}} at a full 180° rotation, the observed images typically {{suffer from a}} [...] "missing wedge" [...] of data, which when using Fourier-based <b>back</b> <b>projection</b> methods decreases the range of resolvable frequencies in the three-dimensional reconstruction. Mechanical refinements, such as multi-axis tilting (two tilt series of the same specimen made at orthogonal directions) and conical tomography (where the specimen is first tilted to a given fixed angle and then imaged at equal angular rotational increments through one complete rotation in {{the plane of the}} specimen grid) can be used to limit the impact of the missing data on the observed specimen morphology. Using focused ion beam milling, a new technique has been proposed which uses pillar-shaped specimen and a dedicated on-axis tomography holder to perform 180° rotation of the sample inside the pole piece of the objective lens in TEM. Using such arrangements, quantitative electron tomography without the missing wedge is possible. In addition, numerical techniques exist which can improve the collected data.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Two great underthrusting {{earthquakes}} {{that occurred}} {{along the coast}} of Peru in 2001 and 2007 involve spatiotemporal slip distributions that differ from the predominantly unilateral or bilateral rupture expansion of many great events. Commonly used finite-source rupture model parameterizations, with specified rupture velocity and/or short duration of slip at each grid point applied to the seismic data for these two events, lead to incorrect slip-distributions or inaccurate estimation of rupture velocities as a result of intrinsic kinematic constraints imposed on the model slip dis-tributions. Guided by large aperture array <b>back</b> <b>projections</b> of teleseismic broadband P-wave signals that image slip locations without imposing a priori kinematic con-straints on the rupture process, we exploit the availability of large global broadband body and surface wave data sets to consider the effects of varying the kinematic con-straints in teleseismic finite-source waveform inversions. By allowing longer than usual rupture durations at each point on the fault using a flexible subfault source-time function parameterization, we find that the anomalous attributes of the 2001 and 2007 Peru earthquake ruptures are readily recognized and accounted for by compound rup-ture models. The great 23 June 2001 (Mw 8 : 4) earthquake involved an initial modest-size event that appears to have triggered a much larger secondary event about 120 km away that developed an overall slip distribution with significant slip located back along the megathrust {{in the vicinity of the}} initial rupture. The great 15 August 2007 (Mw 8 : 0) earthquake was also a composite event, with a modest size initial rupture followed by a 60 -sec delayed larger rupture that initiated ∼ 50 – 60 km away and spread up-dip and bilaterally. When <b>back</b> <b>projections</b> indicate greater rupture complexity than captured in a simple slip-pulse-type rupture model, one should allow for possible long-subfault slip-duration or composite triggered sequences, and not overly constrain the earthquake slip distribution.

Selective activation of <b>back</b> <b>projections</b> from the anterior olfactory nucleus/cortex (AON) revealed functional glutamatergic synaptic connections on several types of bulbar interneurons. Unexpectedly, AON axons also directly depolarized mitral cells (MCs), enough to elicit spikes reliably in a time window of a few milliseconds. MCs received strong disynaptic inhibition, a third of which arises in the glomerular layer. Activating feedback axons in vivo suppressed spontaneous as well as odor-evoked activity of MCs, sometimes preceded by a temporally precise increase in firing probability. Our study indicates that cortical feedback can shape the activity of bulbar output neurons by enabling precisely timed spikes and enforcing broad inhibition to suppress background activity...|$|R
