5|$|The <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> was {{originally}} planned {{to follow a}} slightly different route. The plan would have sent <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> trains to Huntington, with Yellow Line trains serving Franconia–Springfield. This was changed due to a shortage of rail cars {{at the time of}} the completion of the line to Huntington. Because fewer rail cars were required to operate Yellow Line service than would be required to run <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> service out to Huntington – due to the Yellow Line's shorter route – the line designations were switched. From 1999 to 2008, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> operated to Huntington on July 4, as part of Metro's special Independence Day service pattern.|$|E

5|$|Cumberland {{is part of}} the CTA's <b>Blue</b> <b>Line,</b> {{which runs}} from O'Hare Airport to {{downtown}} Chicago and Forest Park. It is the third inbound station from O'Hare on the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> and is situated between the Rosemont and Harlem stations. <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> trains serve Cumberland 24 hours a day every day; trains operate roughly every 7 to 10 minutes during rush hour and midday operation, with longer headways of up to 30 minutes at night. The station is approximately seven minutes from O'Hare, 31 minutes from Clark/Lake in the Loop, and 52 minutes from Forest Park. 1,304,280 passengers boarded at Cumberland in 2011.|$|E

5|$|The Rush+ {{realignment}} {{was intended}} to free up space in the Rosslyn Portal (the tunnel between Rosslyn and Foggy Bottom), which operates at full capacity already. When Silver Line service began, those trains would be routed through the tunnel, and so some of what were <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> trains to Largo Town Center were now diverted across the Fenwick Bridge to become Yellow Line trains running {{all the way up}} the Green Line to Greenbelt. Select Yellow Line trains running south diverted along the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> to Franconia-Springfield (as opposed to the normal Yellow line terminus at Huntington). Until the start of Silver Line service, excess Rosslyn Tunnel capacity was used by additional Orange Line trains that traveled along the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> to Largo (as opposed to the normal Orange Line terminus at New Carrollton). Rush+ had the additional effect of giving some further number of passengers transfer-free journeys, though severely increasing headways for the portion of the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> running between Pentagon and Rosslyn. In May 2017, Metro announced that Yellow Rush+ service would be eliminated effective June 25, 2017.|$|E
5|$|<b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> trains share {{a single}} tunnel with Orange Line and Silver Line trains {{to cross the}} Potomac River. The current tunnel limits service in each direction, {{creating}} a choke point. A 2001 proposal would have rerouted the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> between the Rosslyn and Stadium–Armory stations by building a bridge or tunnel from Virginia to a new station in Georgetown. The proposal was later rejected due to cost, but Metro again started considering a similar scenario in 2011.|$|E

5|$|Construction on the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line,</b> {{which was}} {{initially}} {{known as the}} Hiawatha Line, began in 2001. The line opened in two phases in 2004, beginning with a 12-station stretch from the Warehouse District / Hennepin Avenue station through the Fort Snelling station in June. In December, five more stations were opened, continuing service south of Fort Snelling to the Mall of America station. Two additional <b>Blue</b> <b>Line</b> stations opened in late 2009: a new northern terminus at Target Field and the American Boulevard station in Bloomington. Construction on the Green Line, which was initially designated as the Central Corridor, began in 2010. The line opened in its entirety in June 2014.|$|E

5|$|The British moved three fresh brigades {{up to the}} Red Line by 9:30am on 10 April {{to support}} the advance of the 1st and 2nd Canadian Division, whereupon they were to {{leapfrog}} existing units occupying the Red line and advance to the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line.</b> Fresh units including two sections of tanks and the 13th British Brigade were called up from reserve to support the advance of the 2nd Canadian Division. By approximately 11:00am, the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line,</b> including Hill 135 and the village of Thélus, had been captured. To permit the troops time to consolidate the <b>Blue</b> <b>Line,</b> the advance halted and the barrage remained stationary for 90 minutes while machine guns were brought forward. Shortly before 1:00pm, the advance recommenced with both the 1st and 2nd Canadian Divisions reporting their final objective. The tank-supported advance via Farbus and directed {{at the rear of}} the 79th Reserve Division, was eventually halted by concentrated German fire short of the village. The Canadian 1st and 2nd Divisions were nonetheless able to secure the Brown Line by approximately 2:00pm.|$|E
