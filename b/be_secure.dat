5|$|The {{government}} rejected most of {{the negative}} criticism. The DfES said that the database would only contain basic information and 'will certainly not be including any information on children's diet or school attainment'. Laming had said that information for every child needs to be kept {{so that they would}} not be at risk. The government denied any possibility of function creep. They rebutted the concerns over privacy, with a spokesman for the DfES saying 'we are conscious of the need to respect personal privacy'. Hodge said that the database would <b>be</b> <b>secure,</b> that it would not undermine child protection and that it would help various agencies share information. Hughes said that the database would <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> and that 'we are confident we are doing all we could to ensure security'. The government said that they were confident that the database complied with the Data Protection Act and the Human Rights Act. Paul Ennals, chief executive of the National Children's Bureau, said, 'the index is a proportionate response to a continuing problem and any action that helps reduce the number of children who slip through the net must be welcome'.|$|E

Around {{the middle of}} 1536, Pedro de Alvarado {{received}} news that Alonso Maldonado had been appointed to investigate his governorship of Guatemala, and that Francisco de Montejo had finally accepted governorship of Honduras and was en route. Alvarado was incensed, as his decisive intervention had prevented the complete collapse of the Spanish colonisation efforts in the territory, and he now believed the Spanish position to <b>be</b> <b>secure.</b> With Spanish control apparently firmly established in Honduras, he travelled to Puerto de Caballos and sailed back to Spain {{to deal with his}} legal difficulties.

5|$|Since 1996, the Yunnan hare {{is rated}} {{as a species}} ofleast concernon theIUCN Red Listof Endangered Species. This is {{because it is a}} {{widespread}} species, and it has been reported by residents to be commonly found. Although the current state of its population trend is unclear, the Yunnan hare population is likely to <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> as it occurs in remote areas in southwestern China. However, agricultural activities on mountainous regions may pose a threat to the species by isolating its mountain populations. The Red List of China's Vertebrates has listed the Yunnan hare as near threatened, nearly meeting the criteria to be listed as vulnerable. It occurs in protected areas and also in the Changshanerhai, Daweishan, Gaoligongshan, Jinpingfenshuiling, Nujiang, Shilin, and Tongbiguan Nature Reserves.|$|E

5|$|In 1962, Nhu {{began work}} on the ambitious Strategic Hamlet Program, an attempt to build {{fortified}} villages that would <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> zones for rural Vietnamese. The objective was to lock the Vietcong out {{so that they could}} not operate among the villagers. Thảo supervised these efforts, and when told that the peasants resented being forcibly removed from their ancestral lands and put into forts that they were forced to build, he advised Nhu and Tuyến that it was imperative to build as many hamlets as fast as possible. This pleased the Vietcong, who felt that Thảo's efforts were turning the rural populace against Saigon. Thảo specifically had villages built in areas that he knew had a strong Vietcong presence. This increased the number of communist sympathisers who were placed inside the hamlets and given identification cards. As a result, the Vietcong were able to more effectively penetrate the villages to access supplies and personnel.|$|E
5|$|On Mono Island, {{the main}} landing {{along the south}} coast had been {{achieved}} with relative ease, with few casualties although they had to fend off some attacks that night. However, Logan Force which had landed as planned at Soanotalu, {{on the opposite side}} of the island to 29th and 36th Battalions, experienced some difficulty. Initially unopposed, a defensive perimeter had been established and the American technicians got to work. Over the next three days, some contact had been made with Japanese soldiers, which had evaded the New Zealanders to the south, looking to escape the island by seizing a barge. During the evening of 1 November, a party of 80 Japanese, began attacking Logan Force. A small group of six soldiers from 34th Battalion plus three Americans held a blockhouse throughout the night and by dawn, over 50 Japanese had been killed for the loss of five men. By early November, Japanese resistance had largely been overcome although patrols still made contact with small parties of Japanese and on 12 November, Mono Island was considered to <b>be</b> <b>secure.</b> By this stage, the battalion had reassembled on Mono Island. There were still isolated Japanese that needed to be captured or killed and patrols were ongoing well into January 1944. By this stage, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. Reidy, taking over from Eyre who was now too old for active service and had returned to New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{first trial}} with the Y1 railcars was {{performed}} on 1August 2000. The one unit {{was not able to}} complete the route due to technical problems, but the other train was able to. Terje Bulling, the CEO of Timetoget, stated that he was aiming for 140,000 passengers in 2001, but was worried because NSB, due to lack of engineers, was driving passengers with by taxi between Notodden Station and Nordagutu. On 5October, Vidar Østreng, vice president in NSB and chairman of Timetoget, announced that NSB, due to lack of engineers, would have to reduce the production of train services. He indicated that the least profitable routes, including the Bratsberg Line, would be closed. At the same time, NSB said one possibility could be that they sold their 89% stake in the company, thereby bypassing NSB's rules for engineer training. Five days later, the engineers in NSB stated that they would not operate trains between Larvik Station and Skien, and Kongsberg Station and Bø Station, if Timetoget was allowed to operate. These sections of the Vestfold Line and Sørlandet Line, respectively, are shared with the Bratsberg Line. The engineers considered lack of sufficient training such a safety risk that it would not <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> to operate on the lines. At the same time, NSB announced that they would stop operating trains on the Bratsberg Line from 20October.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{show that}} major cryptosystems such as FDH, OAEP, and RSA-KEM <b>are</b> <b>secure</b> under a hash {{function}} MD h with Merkle-Damg˚ard (MD) construction that uses a random oracle compression function h. First, we propose two new ideal primitives called Traceable Random Oracle (T RO) and Extension Attack Simulatable Random Oracle (ERO) which are weaker than a random oracle (RO). Second, {{we show that}} MD h is indifferentiable from LRO, T RO and ERO, where LRO is Leaky Random Oracle proposed by Yoneyama et al. This result means that if a cryptosystem <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in these models, then the cryptosystem <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> under MD h following the indifferentiability theory proposed by Maurer et al. Finally, we prove that OAEP <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the T RO model and RSA-KEM <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the ERO model. Since it is also known that FDH <b>is</b> <b>secure</b> in the LRO model, as a result, major cryptosystems, FDH, OAEP and RSA-KEM, <b>are</b> <b>secure</b> under MD h, though MD h is not indifferentiable from RO...|$|R

25|$|According to {{professor}} Jan Arild Audestad, at the standardization process {{which started in}} 1982, A5/1 was originally proposed to have a key length of 128 bits. At that time, 128 bits was projected to <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> for at least 15 years. It is now believed that 128 bits would in fact also still <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> until the advent of quantum computing. Audestad, Peter van der Arend, and Thomas Haug says that the British insisted on weaker encryption, with Haug saying he {{was told by the}} British delegate that this was to allow the British secret service to eavesdrop more easily. The British proposed a key length of 48 bits, while the West Germans wanted stronger encryption to protect against East German spying, so the compromise became a key length of 54 bits.|$|E

25|$|However, the {{autonomy}} of the scientific field cannot be taken for granted.

In this way, the conditions of possibility for the production of transcendental objectivity could arise and then disappear.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} and unique property of {{quantum key distribution}} {{is the ability of}} the two communicating users to detect the presence of any third party trying to gain knowledge of the key. This results from a fundamental aspect of quantum mechanics: the process of measuring a quantum system in general disturbs the system. A third party trying to eavesdrop on the key must in some way measure it, thus introducing detectable anomalies. By using quantum superpositions or quantum entanglement and transmitting information in quantum states, a communication system can be implemented that detects eavesdropping. If the level of eavesdropping is below a certain threshold, a key can be produced that is guaranteed to <b>be</b> <b>secure</b> (i.e. the eavesdropper has no information about it), otherwise no secure key is possible and communication is aborted.|$|E
