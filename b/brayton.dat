Of Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain over to Beck after {{the conclusion}} of the case he commented that this was a wise strategic move. Monica Hesse of The Washington Post remarked upon {{the conclusion of}} the case that the division between what is considered libel and satire was murky, and asked whether this determination was more difficult to make on the Internet where speech can be amplified by others.|$|E
5|$|Hastings {{was born}} in Watertown, Jefferson County, New York, on November 22, 1814 to Robert Collins Hastings and Patience <b>Brayton.</b> Robert Collins Hastings {{was a good friend}} and {{supporter}} of DeWitt Clinton, whom Serranus gets his middle name from. When Robert died in 1824, the family moved to St. Lawrence County, New York. He completed a six-year course at Gouverneur Academy, and in 1834, he became taught and became the principal at Norwich Academy, located in Chenango County, New York. He introduced the Hamiltonian system of instruction and the Angletean system of mathematics to the academy. In 1835, he resigned from his position at the academy to study law.|$|E

25|$|The {{working gas}} of a <b>Brayton</b> cycle can be helium, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide. The {{high-pressure}} working gas is expanded in a turbine to produce power. The low-pressure warm gas is cooled in an ambient cooler. The low-pressure cold gas is compressed to the high-pressure of the system. Often the turbine and the compressor are mechanically connected through a single shaft. High pressure <b>Brayton</b> cycles {{are expected to}} have a smaller generator footprint compared to lower pressure Rankine cycles. A <b>Brayton</b> cycle heat engine can operate at lower pressure with wider diameter piping. The world's first commercial <b>Brayton</b> cycle solar power module (100kW) was built and demonstrated in Israel's Arava Desert in 2009.|$|E

25|$|<b>Brayton</b> cycle engines {{compress}} {{and heat}} {{air with a}} fuel suitable for an internal combustion engine. For example, natural gas or biogas heat compressed air, and then a conventional gas turbine engine or the rear portion of a jet engine expands it to produce work.|$|E
25|$|Another {{husband and}} wife team who had a long and {{successful}} run with the play was Oscar Asche and Lily <b>Brayton.</b> First staged in 1899 in the Theatre Royal in Wigan, the play became more prominent when performed at the Adelphi in 1904, directed by Otho Stuart. It subsequently went on a world tour, beginning in Australia, and Asche estimates it was performed about 1,500 times all over the world. Although a financial success, the production received mixed reviews. Many critics commented on the size difference between the large and imposing Asche and the diminutive <b>Brayton,</b> feeling the disparity lent the production an uncomfortable tone, especially insofar as Asche rejected Benson's farcical production in favour of a more psychologically real representation.|$|E
25|$|After a {{campaign}} which seized on public discontent with {{the influence of}} lobbyist and Rhode Island Republican Party Central Committee chairman, General Charles R. <b>Brayton,</b> Higgins was elected over Utter {{by a margin of}} 1,238 votes, becoming Rhode Island's youngest governor, and its first Catholic governor.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, {{the factory}} {{development}} was continued by Scott <b>Brayton</b> and Dominic Dobson, but neither won any races. The engine was utilized by other CART teams in 1991–1992, and was retired after {{the introduction of}} the Ford Cosworth XB with only one victory, that being Rahal's in 1989.|$|E
25|$|The FHR {{retains the}} safety and cost {{advantages}} of a low-pressure, high-temperature coolant, also shared by liquid metal cooled reactors. Notably, steam is not created in the core (as is present in BWRs), and no large, expensive steel pressure vessel (as required for PWRs). Since it can operate at high temperatures, {{the conversion of the}} heat to electricity can use an efficient, lightweight <b>Brayton</b> cycle gas turbine.|$|E
25|$|The {{thermodynamic}} {{cycle of the}} basic combined cycle consists of two power plant cycles. One is the Joule or <b>Brayton</b> cycle which is a gas turbine cycle {{and the other is}} Rankine cycle which is a steam turbine cycle. The cycle 1-2-3-4-1 which is the gas turbine power plant cycle is the topping cycle. It depicts the heat and work transfer process taking place in high temperature region.|$|E
25|$|To {{combat the}} Great Northern, {{in a few}} {{instances}} Villard built branch line mileage simply to occupy a territory, {{regardless of whether the}} territory offered the railroad any business. Mismanagement, sparse traffic, and the Panic of 1893 sounded the death knell for the Northern Pacific and Villard's interest in railroading. The company slipped into its second bankruptcy on October 20, 1893. Oakes was named receiver and <b>Brayton</b> Ives, {{a former chairman of the}} New York Stock Exchange, became president.|$|E
25|$|Thermodynamic efficiency. LFTRs {{operating}} with modern supercritical steam turbines would operate at 45% thermal to electrical efficiency. With future closed gas <b>Brayton</b> cycles, {{which could be}} used in a LFTR power plant due to its high temperature operation, the efficiency could be up to 54%. This is 20 to 40% higher than today's light water reactors (33%), resulting in the same 20 to 40% reduction in fissile and fertile fuel consumption, fission products produced, waste heat rejection for cooling, and reactor thermal power.|$|E
25|$|Combined cycle {{plants are}} usually powered by natural gas, {{although}} fuel oil, synthesis gas or other fuels can be used. The supplementary fuel may be natural gas, fuel oil, or coal. Biofuels {{can also be}} used. Integrated solar combined cycle power stations combine the energy harvested from solar radiation with another fuel to cut fuel costs and environmental impact (look ISCC section). Next generation nuclear power plants {{are also on the}} drawing board which will take advantage of the higher temperature range made available by the <b>Brayton</b> top cycle, as well as the increase in thermal efficiency offered by a Rankine bottoming cycle.|$|E
25|$|Langbar Towers, {{next to a}} {{shopping}} parade, {{was the first of}} five 15-storey H-plan tower blocks to be completed at Whinmoor. The high rise blocks had reinforced concrete frames with no-fines concrete infill panels. The planning application was approved in 1964 and the first block, Langbar Towers, completed on 24 January 1966 was officially opened on 19 February 1966 by Denis Healey MP. Ash Tree Court, <b>Brayton</b> Grange, Farndale Court, Langbar Grange, Langbar Towers and Pennwell Croft, six of seven high-rise blocks of flats built in1966, were demolished in2006. Sherburn Court, the remaining high-rise block, was refurbished and given a new roof, windows and lifts.|$|E
25|$|The gas-cooled {{fast reactor}} (GFR) system {{features}} a fast-neutron spectrum and closed fuel cycle for efficient conversion of fertile uranium {{and management of}} actinides. The reactor is helium-cooled and with an outlet temperature of 850°C it is an evolution of the very-high-temperature reactor (VHTR) to a more sustainable fuel cycle. It will use a direct <b>Brayton</b> cycle gas turbine for high thermal efficiency. Several fuel forms are being considered for their potential to operate at very high temperatures and to ensure an excellent retention of fission products: composite ceramic fuel, advanced fuel particles, or ceramic clad elements of actinide compounds. Core configurations are being considered based on pin- or plate-based fuel assemblies or prismatic blocks.|$|E
25|$|On 4 June 1860, {{he arrived}} at Aspatria with ‘half-a-crown’ (12.5p) in his pocket {{to take up the}} {{position}} of junior partner in the towns veterinary practice. He befriended Sir Wilfrid Lawson, 2nd Baronet of <b>Brayton</b> and together they became two of the prominent members of the Wigton, and later Aspatria Farmers Club. In 1869, along with William Norman and John Twentyman, the ‘dauntless three’ as they became known, he organised the annual Aspatria Agricultural Show. In the following year the trio founded the Aspatria Agricultural Cooperative Society and in 1874 they established the Aspatria Agricultural and Commercial School, later renamed the Aspatria Agricultural College. In 1893, after the sale of the Agricultural School the outgoing directors and shareholders acknowledged his many hours of unpaid tuition with the presentation of a piano, and a gold watch.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in 1989, the U.S. Congress {{passed a}} series of {{amendments}} to the Clean Air Act. Title IV of these amendments established the Acid Rain Program, a cap and trade system designed to control emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides. Title IV called for a total reduction of about 10 million tons of SO2 emissions from power plants. It was implemented in two phases. Phase I began in 1995, and limited sulfur dioxide emissions from 110 of the largest power plants to a combined total of 8.7 million tons of sulfur dioxide. One power plant in New England (Merrimack) was in Phase I. Four other plants (Newington, Mount Tom, <b>Brayton</b> Point, and Salem Harbor) were added under other provisions of the program. Phase II began in 2000, and affects most of the power plants in the country.|$|E
25|$|In gas {{turbines}} and auxiliary power units. Ref. Figures 4.1–4.2 In their simple form, modern {{gas turbines}} {{operate on the}} <b>Brayton</b> cycle. (ref Figure 5.1) Either or both axial and centrifugal compressors are used to provide compression. The types of gas turbines that most often include centrifugal compressors include turboshaft, turboprop, auxiliary power units, and micro-turbines. The industry standards applied {{to all of the}} centrifugal compressors used in aircraft applications are set by the FAA and the military to maximize both safety and durability under severe conditions. Centrifugal impellers used in gas turbines are commonly made from titanium alloy forgings. Their flow-path blades are commonly flank milled or point milled on 5-axis milling machines. When tolerances and clearances are the tightest, these designs are completed as hot operational geometry and deflected back into the cold geometry as required for manufacturing. This need arises from the impeller's deflections experienced from start-up to full speed/full temperature which can be 100 times larger than the expected hot running clearance of the impeller.|$|E
25|$|To the Pennimans {{were born}} four children; Hortensia, who married Judge <b>Brayton</b> of Swanton; Udney, who {{inherited}} the homestead in Colchester; Julietta, who married Dr. Nathan Ryno Smith, a physician of Baltimore; and Adelia, {{who became the}} wife of Dr. Moody, {{one of the early}} physicians of Burlington. Two daughters of Adelia were well known in Burlington, Mrs. Mary M. Howe, and Mrs. Ella M. Goodrich, wife of Prof. E. Goodrich. Penniman’s descendants had in their possession some interesting Allen relics, but two beautiful old Copley portraits of Penniman and her mother, Mrs. Crean Brush, passed into the possession of Mr. Pell, the owner of Ft. Ticonderoga. They were painted in New York in 1771, when Frances was eleven years of age. She is quaintly arrayed in a long bodice and long full skirt with her hair pompadoured and powdered like her mother’s. But her face is strikingly bright and expressive. She holds in one slender hand a basket of flowers, a prophetic hint of that taste that brought her so much satisfaction when she became middle-aged. A Female Academy was started in Middlebury, Vermont in 1802, and Mrs. Emma Willard began the Middlebury Female Seminary there in 1811. It was to her school, first in Middlebury and then in Troy (Emma Willard School), that Adelia Penniman was sent for her education.|$|E

Eriq Gardner of Adweek {{noted that the}} case had strategic import for the field of politics, referring to Beck's style of commentary as exemplified in the interview with Congressman Keith Ellison. Chris Matyszczyk of CNET News commented on the legal issues of the case; he asked whether it should hold to U.S. law as it involved two citizens, and additionally wondered if Beck was asserting trademark over his full name or his individual first and last names as well. Ed <b>Brayton</b> of ScienceBlogs called Randazza's request that Beck stipulate to United States law intellectually creative. Daily Kos pointed out the inherent hypocrisy in Beck's legal position of seeking redress in an international agency when compared to his prior statements criticizing foreign law in favor of U.S. law.|$|E
500|$|Some {{critics have}} commended {{the show for}} its {{widespread}} appeal, while others have argued the opposite and criticized it for catering solely to preschoolers. In an interview with The New York Times, Tom Ascheim said that [...] "the show's quirky appeal extended far beyond Noggin's target audience. 'The simplicity is really understandable by my two-year-old, but my ten-year-old really giggles at Oobi.

2500|$|One type {{of fossil}} fuel power plant uses a gas turbine in {{conjunction}} with a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG).
