5|$|Off {{the coast}} of Los Cabos in Baja California Sur, large swells capsized a fishing boat with seven people aboard on August25. Four were able to swim <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore</b> while the other three {{remained}} missing and were later presumed dead. Strong rain bands along the outer fringes of Hurricane Marie brought heavy rain to parts of the state. Landslides blocked several roads near Los Cabos while gusty winds downed trees and power lines. Owing to the dangerous conditions, all schools Los Cabos were closed on August25.|$|E
5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced that since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore</b> to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|After {{the second}} lacuna, Hymir {{is sitting in}} the boat, unhappy and totally silent, as they row <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> On shore, Hymir {{suggests}} that Thor should help him carry a whale back to his farm. Thor picks both the boat and the whales up, and carries it all back to Hymir's farm. After Thor successfully smashes a crystal goblet by throwing it at Hymir's head on Týr's mother's suggestion, Thor and Týr are given the cauldron. Týr cannot lift it, but Thor manages to roll it, and so with it they leave. Some distance from Hymir's home, an army of many-headed beings led by Hymir attacks the two, but are killed by the hammer of Thor. Although one of his goats is lame in the leg, the two manage to bring the cauldron back, have plenty of ale, and so, from then on, return to Ægir's for more every winter.|$|E

5|$|By 10:00, {{all three}} French ships were {{within range of}} Centurion and a heavy {{exchange}} of fire began. Within 15 minutes, both Centurion and Marengo had their colours shot away and at 10:45 the ship of the line turned away for open water, followed by the frigates, her rigging in disarray. Damage had rendered Centurion unable to manoeuvre rapidly and she began slowly limping inshore to shelter from Marengo among the coastal shoals. Captain Lind rejoined his ship by boat, hailing the Princess Charlotte, which had still not participated in the battle, to cut her anchor cables and go ashore to avoid being captured. Logan refused and at 11:15 surrendered without a fight as the whole French squadron moved back towards the harbour. Marengo again remained beyond the sandbars that marked the entrance. The boatloads of sepoys, who were still en route to Princess Charlotte, turned about and rowed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore</b> to avoid capture. Sémillante took possession of the merchant ship while Marengo and Atalante engaged Centurion, which had moved {{out of range of}} support from the shore batteries.|$|E
5|$|While in {{town with}} the Mistress, Lad saves her from {{an attack by}} a sick dog being chased {{by the police and}} other citizens, who believe it to be rabid. The dog is shot and the upset Mistress, who knew it was not really rabid, goes home. The next day, the town constable comes by boat to the Place to execute Lad under the notion that he is now rabid. The Master argues that the other dog was not rabid and refuses to allow Lad to be shot, {{ordering}} the officer off his property. As the man is leaving, his boat overturns. Unable to swim, he is in danger of drowning until Lad jumps in and brings him <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> The grateful officer states that he killed the dog he came to kill and Lad only looks a little like him.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the attack, Godsal and Lynes had carefully consulted available charts of Ostend following the previous operation's failure caused by German repositioning of navigation buoys. This careful study was, however, rendered worthless by a sudden fog which obliterated all sight of the shore. Steaming {{back and forth across}} the harbour entrance in the fog as the monitors and German shore batteries engaged in a long range artillery duel over the lost cruiser, Godsal looked for the piers marking the entrance to the canal. As he searched, two German torpedo boats sailed from Ostend to intercept the cruiser, but in the heavy fog they collided and, disabled, limped <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> During this period, Godsal's motor launches lost track of the cruiser in the murk, and it was not until the third pass that Vindictive found the entrance, accompanied by only one of the launches. Heading straight into the mouth of the canal, guided by a flare dropped by the launch, Vindictive became an instant target of the German batteries and was badly damaged, the shellfire exacerbating the damage suffered in the earlier Zeebrugge Raid and seriously damaging Vindictives port propeller.|$|E

5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen {{that he and his}} wife are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they would have made a great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps out of the water and onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore</b> on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
5|$|On September16, strong waves {{produced}} by the hurricane disabled the Swedish freighter Laponia, {{which at the time}} was located 300mi (480km) east of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. The ship was initially en route for Rio de Janeiro carrying cargo for the Bethlehem Steel Company. As a result of the stranded ship, the SS President Roosevelt was forced to divert its course in order to render aid. The United States Coast Guard cutters USCGC Sebago (WHEC-42) and USCGC Carrabasset (WAT-55) were sent from the Virginia Capes in order to provide assistance. In addition, a coast guard plane was dispatched from Elizabeth City, North Carolina. The ships remained on standby to monitor the Laponia for three hours before conditions were considered safe to tow the stricken ship <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> Two fishing vessels capsized off Barnegat and Edgemere, New York, with both incidents resulting in a fatality. A cabin cruiser was sent to rescue occupants of the capsized boat off Edgemere, though it was also disrupted by rough seas. The ship was later able to rescue the other surviving crew members. Numerous other small craft off Long Island signaled distress calls to the US Coast Guard due to strong waves offshore. Eventually passing east of New England, the storm's large size resulted in heavy rainfall near Nantucket Island, Massachusetts. A weather station on the island reported maximum sustained winds of 45mph (70km/h). In Eastport, Maine, a weather station recorded a minimum barometric pressure of 993mbar (hPa; 29.33inHg) and wind speeds of 33mph (53km/h). In Maine, power lines were downed, damaging communications. In Bar Harbor, strong winds caused five fires, which were later extinguished. The schooner George Dresser ran aground on the port's coast. The hurricane also produced slight snowfalls in northern areas of the state.|$|E
5|$|Theramenes {{remained}} a general through 407 BC, but, in that year, when the Athenian defeat at Notium {{led to the}} downfall of Alcibiades and his political allies, Theramenes was not reelected. In the next year, however, he did sail as a trierarch in the scratch Athenian relief fleet sent out to relieve Conon, who had been blockaded with 40 triremes at Mytilene by Callicratidas. That relief force won a surprising victory over the more experienced Spartan force in the Battle of Arginusae, but {{in the wake of}} that battle Theramenes found himself {{in the middle of a}} massive controversy. At the end of the battle, the generals in command of the fleet had conferred to decide on their next steps. Several pressing concerns presented themselves; 50 Peloponnesian ships under Eteonicus {{remained a}}t Mytilene, blockading Conon, and decisive action by the Athenians could lead to the destruction of that force as well, but, at the same time, ships needed to be dispatched to recover the sailors of the twenty five Athenian triremes sunk or disabled in the battle. Accordingly, all eight generals, with the larger part of the fleet, set out for Mytilene, while a rescue force under Thrasybulus and Theramenes, both of whom were trierarchs in this battle but had served as generals in prior campaigns, remained behind to pick up the survivors and retrieve corpses for burial. At this point, however, a severe storm blew up, and both of these forces were driven <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> Eteonicus escaped, and a great number of Athenian sailors—estimates as to the precise figure have ranged from near 1,000 to as many as 5,000—drowned.|$|E

She tells Dan that he must hand himself to make atonement for his crime. However, upon returning to the hut, he finds that the crew of his fishing boat have found the body there. In shock he allows himself to be taken with them as they take the body out to sea to dispose of it. However, when they throw the body into the sea, it miraculously escapes its weighted sheet floats <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> This Dan takes as a sign of God's will and so he steers the ship <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> But, once on land and taking a shortcut to the Deemster's house to hand himself in, Dan falls down a mineshaft, from which he is unable to escape until the next morning.|$|E
25|$|On {{the evening}} of 27 April 1944 a Liberator Bomber of the United States Army Air Forces crashed off Foreness Point. The aircraft, from the 446th Bomb Group, RAF Bungay in Norfolk, {{had been on a}} bombing raid over the rail {{marshalling}} yards at Blainville-sur-l'Eau in north-eastern France. The plane was returning to base after the bombing mission when it crashed. 8 of 10 crew aboard were killed with two having parachuted to safety just before the crash.

The tremendous difficulties experienced in getting them <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore</b> led to the repeal of the new law. In 1995 it was the penultimate French lighthouse to become automated, a process delayed due to the keepers on-site staging a protest against the task being carried out.|$|E
25|$|On 5 May 1831 Yorke was {{returning}} from visiting Henry Hotham's flagship, , then moored at Spithead. He {{was making his}} way <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore</b> aboard the yacht Catherine, in company with Captains Matthew Barton Bradby and Thomas Young, and a seaman named John Chandler, when the boat was struck by lightning in Stokes Bay, causing it to capsize. All aboard were drowned. The bodies were later recovered and an inquest returned a verdict of accidental death. Yorke was buried at the family tomb in the parish church at Wimpole, close to Wimpole Hall, {{the seat of the}} Earls of Hardwicke.|$|E
25|$|Kingani {{was spotted}} from the shore, and Spicer-Simson's men quickly {{took to the}} water, cutting Kingani off from her base. Taken by {{surprise}} Junge ordered Kinganis speed to be increased, but as the six-pounder gun mounted in the forepart of Kingani could only fire forward, {{he was forced to}} circle to aim at the lead British boat, Mimi. The Germans also opened fire with rifles, as the British boats closed on Kingani. Eventually the British scored a direct hit, a three-pounder shell passing through the gunshield and killing Junge, and two petty officers, Penne and Schwarz. Several more shells hit Kingani, starting fires and flooding. With Junge dead, the chief engineer hauled down the colours and waved a white handkerchief. Mimi then approached, accidentally ramming Kingani at full speed. Toutou also came alongside, and took possession of Kingani, which was then sailed <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b>|$|E

25|$|About a year later, Archibald has {{returned}} to Cruden Bay and is preparing a permanent residence there. He buys a trunk from an auctioneer on the street (where he again encounters Gormala) and finds that the trunk contains letters from the late 16th and early 17th centuries. While near the seashore, Archibald notices two ladies stranded on a rock out in the ocean. He helps them get <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore,</b> and learns {{that one of the}} ladies is an elderly woman named Mrs. Jack, and the other a young, beautiful woman named Marjory, an American who has a strong aversion to Spaniards. Archibald feels himself falling in love with Marjory instantly. Later, Marjory helps Archibald decode the letters that he found in the trunk, which are written in a complicated cipher (Bacon's cipher). Archibald soon proposes marriage to Marjory, but she declines with the excuse that she does not know him well enough.|$|E
25|$|Caine ignored {{their advice}} but did adapt the plot and {{characters}} {{to some of}} T.E. Brown's suggestions. He also sought the advice of two other Manxmen, A.W. Moore and Sir James Gell, particularly on the legal background of the novel. Having assembled his materials, Caine wrote the novel at his house in Bexley {{in the space of}} only seven months, a feat made possible by his recycling material from his 1885 novella, She's All The World To Me, in particular the central scene of Ewan's body floating <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> Caine visited the Isle of Man for a week in August to check the locations of some scenes in the novel and by September the novel was ready to go to the publisher. In financial need, Caine sold the copyright to Chatto & Windus for £150, signing the contract on 27 September 1887. Unfortunately for Caine, the terms of the contract meant that he did not gain the wealth of royalties when the book became a best-seller upon its release in November. Indeed, in 1921 when Caine wanted to release his Collected Works through a different publisher, he would have to pay £350 to Chatto & Windus for the rights to The Deemster.|$|E
25|$|A varying {{number of}} marines (epibatai), usually 10–20, were carried aboard for {{boarding}} actions. At the Battle of Salamis, each Athenian ship was recorded to have 14 hoplites and 4 archers (usually Scythian mercenaries) on board, but Herodotus narrates that the Chiots had 40 hoplites on board at Lade {{and that the}} Persian ships carried a similar number. This reflects the different practices between the Athenians and other, less professional navies. Whereas the Athenians relied on speed and maneuverability, where their highly trained crews had the advantage, other states favored boarding, {{in a situation that}} closely mirrored the one that developed during the First Punic War. Grappling hooks would be used both as a weapon and for towing damaged ships (ally or enemy) <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>shore.</b> When the triremes were alongside each other, marines would either spear the enemy or hop across and cut the enemy down with their swords. As the presence of too many heavily armed hoplites on deck tended to destabilize the ship, the epibatai were normally seated, only rising to carry out any boarding action. The hoplites belonged to the middle social classes, so that they came immediately next to the trierarch in status aboard the ship.|$|E
