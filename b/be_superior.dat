In Menexenus, however, Socrates (through Plato) casts aspersions on Pericles' rhetorical fame, claiming ironically that, since Pericles was educated by Aspasia, a trainer of many orators, he would <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> in rhetoric to someone educated by Antiphon. He also attributes authorship of the Funeral Oration to Aspasia and attacks his contemporaries' veneration of Pericles.|$|E

Endosonography and computed tomography were performed for preoperative TNM staging (clinical TNM) of esophageal carcinoma. Endosonography <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> to computed tomography for diagnosing early stages and nonresectability of carcinoma. Endosonography <b>was</b> also <b>superior</b> to computed tomography in diagnosing regional lymph node metastases. For diagnosing nonmetastatic lymph nodes, however, computed tomography <b>was</b> <b>superior.</b> Endosonography <b>was</b> <b>superior</b> for diagnosing celiac lymph node metastases but less accurate in detecting liver involvement.

Part of this was related to its closed-box design. The researchers held that the extremely fast decay time of the speaker in the low frequencies ensures that the bass instruments (guitar and drums) are correctly balanced in the mix.|$|E

Sales of the beer doubled in 1981 owing {{to the increase in}} free trade outlets in the South stocking the beer.

5|$|Continued work {{displayed}} {{a number of}} minor problems, and {{the decision was made}} to introduce a redesigned unit with significant improvements in packaging, insulation, and other practical changes. This would become the AI Mk. V, which began to arrive from Pye in late February and immediately demonstrated a host of problems. By this time the microwave units were being designed, and the Mk. V was almost cancelled. A contract for over 1,000 units was allowed to continue in case of delays in the new units. By May the issues with the Pye design were ironed out, and the FIU's testing revealed it to <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> to the Mk. IV, especially in terms of maintenance. An RAE report agreed.|$|E
5|$|Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics {{and was considered}} to <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> to its predecessor. Much of the praise went to the game's graphics, control and music, with major criticisms varying between the trial-and-error gameplay, lack of level variety, easy boss levels and lack of innovation. The game {{went on to become}} one of the best-selling PlayStation video games of all time and replaced its predecessor as the highest-selling Western title in Japan at the time, selling more than 800,000 units in the country by April 1998. A remastered version was included in the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy collection, released on the PlayStation 4 in June 2017.|$|E

As a result, the XSO3C was declared {{the winner of the}} contract, and was ordered into production. Named Seagull by the U.S. Navy, and Seamew by the Royal Navy, the SO3C developed a disastrous reputation in service, and was retired before the SOC biplane which it was intended to replace.|$|E

As there was little funding to be had from the CIA budget, McDonnell developed the aircraft using its own funds, although technical support gleaned from Oxcart was supplied by the CIA. The McDonnell Isenglass/Rheinberry proposal's shape remains classified, although it has been described as being similar to the Space Shuttle, albeit much reduced in size. A 1/3 cross-sectional model of the aircraft was constructed to illustrate the principles used in its construction.|$|E

Following Victoria's death in 1901, her successor, Edward VII, returned Karim to India and ordered the confiscation and destruction of the Munshi's correspondence with Victoria. Karim subsequently lived quietly near Agra, on the estate that Victoria had arranged for him, until his death at the age of 46.|$|E

5|$|Topiramate, a {{derivative}} of the naturally occurring sugar monosaccharide D-fructose, {{has been found}} effective in helping alcoholics quit or {{cut back on the}} amount they drink. Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence. A 2010 review found that topiramate may <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.|$|E

5|$|A weary Emperor who {{no longer}} cared for the throne, an heir who {{had no desire to}} assume the crown, an {{increasingly}} discontented ruling class who were dismissive of the Imperial role in national affairs: all these factors presaged the monarchy's impending doom. The means to achieve the overthrow of the Imperial system would soon appear within the Army ranks. Republicanism had never flourished in Brazil outside of certain elitist circles, and had little support in the provinces. A growing combination of republican and Positivist ideals among the army's junior and mid-level officer ranks, however, began to form a serious threat to the monarchy. These officers favored a republican dictatorship, which they believed would <b>be</b> <b>superior</b> to the liberal democratic monarchy. Beginning with small acts of insubordination {{at the beginning of the}} 1880s, discontent in the army grew in scope and audacity during the decade, as the Emperor was uninterested and the politicians proved incapable of re-establishing the government's authority over the military.|$|E
