40|$|Ultrasonic {{method of}} {{generation}} {{of a stable}} suspension of nano-particles of titanium dioxide and the strengthening properties of the ornamental fine concrete that contains cement binders with a nano-dispersed additive constitute {{the subject of the}} research covered by the authors. Nanoparticles react with the <b>basic</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> that compose the concrete and act as crystallization centres. Therefore, the concrete porosity is reduced, while physical and technology-related properties of the ornamental fine concrete are improved. The authors have proven that the application of the nano-dispersed additive that contains titanium dioxide influences the processes of the structure formation in respect of fine ornamental concretes and improves the strength, as well as the water and cold resistance of fine concretes. The improvement is attributed to the dense concrete structure and strong adhesion between cement grains and between the cement and the aggregate. This conclusion is based on the data obtained through the employment of an electronic microscope used to identify the porosity of fine concretes.

40|$|The band-unfolding {{method is}} widely used to {{calculate}} the effective band structures of a disordered system from its supercell model. The unfolded band structures show the crystallographic symmetry of the underlying structure, where the difference of chemical components and the local atomic relaxation are ignored. It has been, however, still difficult to decompose the unfolded band structures into the modes based on the crystallographic symmetry of the underlying structure, and therefore detailed analyses of the unfolded band structures have been restricted. In this study, we develop a procedure to decompose the unfolded band structures according to the small representations (SRs) of the little groups. For this purpose, we derive the projection operators for SRs based on the group representation theory. We also introduce another type of projection operators for <b>chemical</b> <b>elements,</b> which enables us to decompose the unfolded band structures into the contributions of different combinations of <b>chemical</b> <b>elements.</b> Using the current method, we investigate the phonon band structure of disordered face-centered cubic Cu 0. 75 Au 0. 25, which has large variations of atomic masses and force constants among the atomic sites due to the chemical disorder.

Characteristic features that can trace individual heavy elements in the adiabatic exponent γ 1 = (∂ ln p/ ∂ ln ̺) s (s being specific entropy), and hence in the adiabatic sound speed were searched. It has emerged that prominent signatures of individual elements exist, and that these effects are greatest in the ionization zones, typically located {{near the bottom of the}} convection zone. The main result is that part of the features found here depend strongly both on the given species (atom or ion) and its detailed internal partition function, whereas other features only depend on the presence of the species itself, not on details such as the internal partition function.

Hypomineralization of molars and incisors (molar-incisor {{hypomineralization}} - MIH) {{is defined}} as enamel hypomineralization of systemic origin {{of one or more}} of the four first permanent molars, which may be associated with changes in the maxillary, and less frequently in the permanent mandibular incisors. The aim of this study was to investigate the mineral content in hypomineralized teeth as a contribution to under-standing the origin of these changes, which will be important for effective restorative approach. Methods. A total of 10 extracted first permanent molars diagnosed with MIH were used in the study as the experimental group, and intact first premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were used as the control group. A certain surface of hypomineralized аnd healthy enamel and dentin was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope equipped with an energydispersive spectrometer (SEM/EDS). Results. By conducting quantitative chemical analysis of the distribution of the <b>basic</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>elements,</b> it was found that the concentration of calcium (Ca) and phosphorus (P) was significantly higher in healthy enamel (Ca = 28. 80 wt%, and P = 15. 05 wt%) compared to hypomineralized enamel (Ca = 27. 60 wt% and P = 14. 32 wt%). Carbon (C) concentration was statistically significantly higher in hypomineralized enamel (C = 11. 70 wt%) compared to healthy enamel (C = 10. 94 wt%). Hypomineralized and healthy enamel did not differ significantly regarding the ratio of calcium and phosphorus concentrations whereas the ratio of calcium and carbon concentrations was statistically significantly higher in healthy enamel compared to hypomineralized enamel. Conclusion. Concentration of the main <b>chemical</b> <b>elements,</b> primarily calcium and phosphorus, is significantly reduced in hypomineralized enamel whereas carbon concentration is increased compared to healthy enamel...|$|R

We approach {{a study on}} the solid state diffusion bonding between zircaloy (Zy 4) and stainless steel (304 L) for an application in the sector of the nuclear power. The diffusion couples prepared underwent treatments at the temperatures ranging between 850 ∘C and 1020 ∘C in a controlled atmosphere and under dynamic pressures of contact. We give a particular attention to the morphology of the interface, formed, with the chemical reactions of exchange which proceed between two entities Zy 4 / 304 L like with the determination {{of the nature of the}} compounds formed with the interface.

40|$|Background. From the {{analysis}} of exploitation of heat-resistant details of thermal power and metallurgical equipment, {{it was found that}} the basic characteristic of metallic materials working under extreme conditions is oxidation resistance. However, the choice of materials for work in the conditions of high temperatures and aggressive environments should be made taking into account not only its oxidation resistance but also the possibility of this material to work long time in the conditions of thermal cycling without being damaged, thus thinking about its heat-resistance. Consequently, it is tremendously important to determine the oxidation resistance of iron-based alloys in extreme conditions depending on the presence of main elements – chrome and aluminium – in their content on the basis of study of formation processes on the item surface of high-quality protective oxides films. Objective. The aim of the paper is to establish the selection rules of heat-resistant iron-based alloys for work in extreme conditions depending on temperatures and aggressive environments and to accumulate some information on their oxidation resistance for the creation of a database and development of methodology how to forecast special properties of alloys. Methods. Models with 10 mm in diameter and 20 mm in length were tested in a tubular stove at the temperature of 1200 and 1250 °C during 100 hours. Oxidation resistance was determined by a weight method. Phase composition and structure were explored by modern X-ray structural and metallographic methods. Results. Processes and mechanisms of formation of oxide scale in the conditions of exploitation of items under the temperature 1250 °C in different aggressive environments are established. The optimum boundaries of concentration of <b>basic</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>elements</b> – chrome and aluminium – in heat-resistant alloys for work in extreme conditions depending on temperatures and environments are determined.
