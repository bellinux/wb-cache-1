25|$|The Mississippi {{sandhill crane}} {{has lost the}} most range; it used to live along most of the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico coast, and its range was once nearly parapatric with that of its eastern neighbor. As of 2013, about 25 breeding pairs exist in an intensively managed population. The Mississippi Sandhill Crane National Wildlife Refuge—established in 1975 when fewer than 35 of the birds existed—has the biggest release program for cranes on Earth, and 90% of the cranes there were raised in captivity. The second viable egg from a two-egg nest was occasionally removed from the nests, starting in 1965, {{to become part of}} a captive flock. This <b>breeding</b> <b>flock</b> is divided between the Audubon Institute's Species Survival Center and White Oak Conservation in Yulee, Florida. These cranes have produced offspring for annual releases into the refuge.|$|E
60|$|In the rear, {{the shelter}} {{afforded by the}} belt of furze bushes was artificially {{improved}} by an inclosure of upright stakes, interwoven with boughs of the same prickly vegetation, and within the inclosure lay a renowned Marlbury-Down <b>breeding</b> <b>flock</b> of eight hundred ewes.|$|E
60|$|The splendid Marlbury <b>breeding</b> <b>flock</b> is as renowned as ever, and, to the eye, {{seems the}} same in every {{particular}} {{that it was in}} earlier times; but the animals which composed it {{on the occasion of the}} events gathered from the Justice are divided by many ovine generations from its members now. Lambing Corner has long since ceased to be used for lambing purposes, though the name still lingers on as the appellation of the spot. This abandonment of site may be partly owing to the removal of the high furze bushes which lent such convenient shelter at that date. Partly, too, it may be due to another circumstance. For it is said by present shepherds in that district that during the nights of Christmas week flitting shapes are seen in the open space around the trilithon, together with the gleam of a weapon, and the shadow of a man dragging a burden into the hollow. But of these things there is no certain testimony.|$|E

50|$|The Bourbon Red is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} turkey {{named for its}} unique reddish plumage and for Bourbon County, Kentucky. The breed standard indicates mature Bourbon Red toms (males) weigh 15 kg, and mature hens (females) weigh 8.2 kg. The breed standard indicates the Bourbon Red should weigh 10.4 kg for toms and 6.3 kg for hens at slaughter age (28 weeks). These standard weights were published with anticipation of {{the potential of the}} Bourbon Red and when the breed was at its prime. Though there are efforts to restore and accomplish the Bourbon Red standard, today these weights are realized by few breeders and growers. Bourbon Reds have been unrefined for too long {{due to the lack of}} selective breeding to preserve the breed.

40|$|The traits {{with the}} {{greatest}} financial impact on sheep production are the number of lambs weaned per ewe and growth efficiency. FecB and Callipyge are the most well known major genes concerned with these traits. In order to conduct a Marker Assisted Introgression (MAI) program we surveyed the presence of responsible mutations in Afshari sheep <b>breeding</b> <b>flock.</b> Direct tests to detect of FecB B and CLPG alleles were conducted on 74 and 58 DNA samples respectively by PCR-RFLP assay. Also the polymorphism content of the <b>breeding</b> <b>flock</b> was investigated by genotyping of one hundred randomly sampled animals at eighteen microsatellite loci selected on the chromosomes carrying and not carrying introgressed genes. A part from MCMA 26 monomorphic pattern, microsatellite loci showed moderate level of polymorphism, as such totally 102 alleles were detected with a mean number of 6 alleles per locus. A full characterization of this set of seventeen polymorphic loci was carried out generating allele frequency distributions {{that were used to}} estimate genetic parameters of these loci, including expected heterozygosity, Polymorphism Information Content (PIC), probability of identity (I) and discrimination power (D). The average expected heterozygosity was 0. 72 (SD = 0. 07) and the average PIC was 0. 67 (SD = 0. 08). Cumulative value of I considering for linked loci were estimated as 3. 128 E- 13. The results of microsatellite analysis indicated that, despite the selective breeding and closed flock system over a number of generations, a relatively high level of heterozygosity still exists in the <b>breeding</b> <b>flock.</b> Besides, the banding patterns resulted from AvaII digestion of FecB and CLPG amplicons approved the absence of the mutations in this flock.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to describe the Salmonella prevalence in turkey flocks before and after the implementation of the Salmonella control program in Germany and to identify factors that are potentially associated with the presence of Salmonella in the flocks. To achieve this, all <b>breeding</b> <b>flocks</b> and a representative sample of the fattening flocks were tested for Salmonella. None of the 98 turkey <b>breeding</b> <b>flocks</b> but 31 (10. 3 %) of 300 turkey fattening flocks were positive for Salmonella spp. in the baseline study during 2006 / 2007. In 11 (3. 7 %) fattening flocks S. Enteritidis (1 flock; 0. 3 %) or S. Typhimurium (8 flocks; 2. 7 %) or monophasic S. Typhimurium (2 flocks; 0. 3 %), which are of special public health relevance in Germany, were detected. Logistic regression analysis confirmed that production type and season were significant risk factors for the presence of Salmonella spp. in fattening turkey flocks in Germany. Data from mandatory official testing within the Salmonella control program in 2010 and 2011 revealed that Salmonella prevalence in turkey fattening flocks has decreased significantly to 3. 3 % and 2. 6 %. In line with this result, prevalence of S. Enteritidis or S. Typhimurium had decreased to 2. 6 % and 1. 5 %.

Mortality {{was defined as the}} sum of dead chicks, dead-in-shell embryos and culls due to various other reasons. There was a large variation in culling rates due to poor hatching. The major reasons for culling were dead-in-shell embryos, weak chicks, dead chicks, omphalitis and physical abnormalities such as incomplete feathering, weak limbs, distorted beaks and wetness. There was no significant correlation between the age of <b>breeding</b> <b>flock</b> and percentage of culls indicating that culling rate was not strongly influenced by the age of <b>breeding</b> <b>flock.</b> Although, factors contributing to poor hatching include management and incubation failures, the most probable cause of abnormalities, weak chicks and omphalitis are diseased breeder flocks or poor hygiene and sanitation in hatchery operations. Two of the hatcheries used a combination of formaldehyde and iodine for disinfection but hygiene standards were compromised due to inadequate cleaning in all three hatcheries. The poor hatch experienced in this study suggests that there is considerable room for improvement in hatchery operations particularly with regards to hygiene and sanitation.
