5|$|An {{isolated}} {{population in}} Crimea {{has sometimes been}} separated as T. v. tauricus, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{considered to be a}} valid form. Mistle thrush fossils have been found in Pleistocene deposits from Poland and Sicily.|$|E
5|$|From {{the first}} attack at 12:37 to the {{explosion}} at 14:23, Yamato {{was hit by}} at least 11 torpedoes and six bombs. There may have been two more torpedo and bomb hits, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> confirmed.|$|E
5|$|In a liberalised energy market, investors, {{operators}} and consumers should face {{the full cost}} of their decisions. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the case in many economies or energy sectors. Many policies distort the market in favour of existing fossil fuel technologies.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} thought that models {{must be more}} {{abundant}} than mimics, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> always so.|$|E
5|$|It is {{sometimes}} understood that fatalities increase {{with the increase}} of VMT, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> systematic as fatalities might remain quite stable while the VMT change.|$|E
5|$|A popular myth is that {{sharks are}} immune to disease and cancer, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> scientifically supported. Sharks {{have been known}} to get cancer. Both {{diseases}} and parasites affect sharks. The evidence that sharks are at least resistant to cancer and disease is mostly anecdotal and there have been few, if any, scientific or statistical studies that show sharks to have heightened immunity to disease.|$|E
25|$|Lakatos' {{philosophy}} of mathematics is sometimes {{regarded as a}} kind of social constructivism, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> his intention.|$|R

30|$|The {{increased}} signal intensity was prominent at the retrodiscal tissue, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{directly related}} to the degree of fracture displacement.|$|R
5|$|Coutances {{started his}} career as a clerk to King Henry II of England in the royal chamber. He {{probably}} owed the position to his brother, who was already in royal service. Coutances may have been associated with the Beaumont family faction at court before beginning work for the king, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> certain.|$|E
5|$|Coyotes rarely kill healthy adult red foxes, {{and have}} been {{observed}} to feed or den alongside them, though they often kill foxes caught in traps. Coyotes may kill fox kits, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{a major source of}} mortality. In southern California, coyotes frequently kill gray foxes, and these smaller canids tend to avoid areas with high coyote densities.|$|E
5|$|Devices {{based on}} the Kirkwood {{system on a chip}} (SoC) are {{supported}} too, such as the SheevaPlug plug computer and OpenRD products. There are efforts to run Debian on mobile devices, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a project goal yet since the Debian Linux kernel maintainers would not apply the needed patches. Nevertheless, there are packages for resource-limited systems.|$|E

50|$|<b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> to <b>be,</b> for Das stopped this {{creative}} activity and thus ended the {{short period of}} his career as visual artist.|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to early Qenya, the grammar of Quenya {{was influenced by}} Finnish, an agglutinative language, but much more by Latin, a synthetic and fusional language, and also Greek, from which he probably took {{the idea of the}} diglossia of Quenya with its highly codified variety: the Parmaquesta, used only in certain situations such as literature. Also the phonology of Quenya was inspired by certain aspects of Finnish, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> easily recognised.|$|E
5|$|Kosher salt, though refined, {{contains}} no iodine {{and has a}} much larger grain size than most refined salts. This can give it different properties when used in cooking, and can be useful for preparing kosher meat. Some kosher salt has been certified to meet kosher requirements by a hechsher, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> true for all products labelled as kosher salt.|$|E
5|$|Most Nahuatl {{varieties}} have {{a number}} of ways to alter the valency of a verb. Classical Nahuatl had a passive voice (also sometimes defined as an impersonal voice), <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> found in most modern varieties. However the applicative and causative voices are found in many modern dialects. Many Nahuatl varieties also allow forming verbal compounds with two or more verbal roots.|$|E
50|$|For a time it {{was assumed}} that after the war some Whippets were rebuilt as {{armoured}} recovery vehicles, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> the case.|$|R
50|$|His {{name was}} uncommon. Another Rabâ-ša-Marduk was {{governor}} of Isin <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> until the reign of Nabu-apla-iddina, around four hundred years later.|$|R
50|$|Goliath motors ltd in Bremen (Part of the Borgward-group) also {{produced}} a threewheeler until 1961, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> {{a version of}} the Hanseat.|$|R
5|$|Oda's {{parents were}} Danish, {{and he may}} have been born in East Anglia. His father was said to have been a Dane who came to England in 865, {{together}} with the Viking army of Ubba and Ivar, and presumably settled in East Anglia. Oda's nephew Oswald of Worcester later became Archbishop of York. It is possible that Oswald's relatives Oscytel, afterwards Archbishop of York, and Thurcytel, an abbot, were also relatives of Oda, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known for sure.|$|E
5|$|R. s. sondaicus, the {{nominate}} subspecies, {{known as}} the Indonesian Javan rhinoceros, once lived on Java and Sumatra. The population is now confined to as more than 63 animals in the wild, Ujung Kulon National Park on the western tip of the island of Java. One researcher {{has suggested that the}} Javan rhino on Sumatra belonged to a distinct subspecies, R. s. floweri, <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> widely accepted.|$|E
5|$|Some {{commentators}} {{consider that}} the United States was a de facto member of OPEC during its formal occupation of Iraq, due to its leadership of the Coalition Provisional Authority in 2003–2004. <b>But</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> {{borne out by the}} minutes of OPEC meetings, as no US representative attended in an official capacity.|$|E

5|$|The {{seven people}} on board {{abandoned}} the boat, and were rescued. The second report was a boat that reported to be taking on water {{off the coast of}} California, on July 8.

5|$|According to the {{statutes}} of the Nobel Foundation, each laureate {{is required to}} give a public lecture on a subject related {{to the topic of}} their prize. The Nobel lecture as a rhetorical genre took decades to reach its current format. These lectures normally occur during Nobel Week (the week leading up to the award ceremony and banquet, which begins with the laureates arriving in Stockholm and normally ends with the Nobel banquet), <b>but</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> mandatory. The laureate is only obliged to give the lecture within six months of receiving the prize. Some have happened even later. For example, US President Theodore Roosevelt received the Peace Prize in 1906 but gave his lecture in 1910, after his term in office. The lectures are organised by the same association which selected the laureates.|$|E
