5|$|Except for {{the bare}} facts of his life, {{little is known}} about Deusdedit. Deusdedit's {{successor}} as Archbishop of Canterbury, Wighard, had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> clergy. Deusdedit was regarded as a saint after his death, with a feast day of 14July, although the Bosworth Psalter, a late 10th or early 11th-century psalter produced at , gives a date of 15 July. His feast day is designated as a major feast day, and is included along with those of a number of other early Canterbury archbishops in the Bosworth Psalter. Deusdedit was buried in the church of St Augustine's in Canterbury, but was translated to the new abbey church in 1091. A hagiography, or saint's biography, on Deusdedit was written by Goscelin after the translation of his relics, but the work was based mainly on Bede's account; the manuscript of the De Sancto Deusdedit Archiepiscopo survives as part of British Library manuscript (ms) Cotton Vespasian B.xx. Because of the late date of the Sancto, Bede's Historia is the main source for what {{little is known about}} Deusdedit. Other than the hagiography, there is scant evidence of a cult surrounding him. His shrine survived until the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1530s.|$|E
5|$|George did {{not play}} a senior role in {{government}} until his wife Anne succeeded as queen on William's death in 1702. George was the chief mourner at William's funeral. Anne appointed him generalissimo of all English military forces on 17 April, and Lord High Admiral, the official but nominal head of the Royal Navy, on 20 May. Actual power at the Admiralty was held by George Churchill, whose elder brother was John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, a great friend of Anne's and the captain-general of English land forces. Prince George had known the Churchills for years: another brother Charles Churchill, had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> gentlemen of the bedchamber in Denmark, and Marlborough had accompanied George on his journey from Denmark to England for his marriage to Anne in 1683. His secretary in the 1680s was Colonel Edward Griffith, brother-in-law of the Duchess of Marlborough, who was Anne's close confidante and friend. George followed William III as Captain-General of the Honourable Artillery Company, and was made Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. Anne failed, however, in her attempts to persuade the States General of the Netherlands to elect her husband captain-general of all Dutch forces, to maintain the unified command of the Maritime Powers that William had held.|$|E

25|$|Labeo's most {{important}} literary work was the Libri posteriores, so called because published only after his death. It contained a systematic exposition {{of the common}} law. His Libri ad Edictum embraced a commentary, {{not only on the}} edicts of the urban and peregrine praetors, but also on that of the curule aediles. His Probabilium lib. VIII., a collection of definitions and axiomatic legal propositions, seems to have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> most characteristic productions.|$|E
25|$|Manding Bory was crowned {{under the}} throne name Mansa Abubakari (a Manding {{corruption}} of the Muslim name Abu Bakr). Mansa Abubakari's mother was Namandjé, the third wife of Maghan Kon Fatta. Prior to becoming mansa, Abubakari had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brother's generals and later his kankoro-sigui.

25|$|Lankester appears, thinly disguised, {{in several}} novels. He {{is the model}} for Sir Roderick Dover in H.G. Wells' Marriage (Wells had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> students), and in Robert Briffault's Europa, which {{contains}} a brilliant portrait of Lankester, including his friendship with Karl Marx. He has also been suggested {{as the model for}} Professor Challenger in Arthur Conan Doyle's The Lost World, but Doyle himself said that Challenger was based on a professor of physiology at the University of Edinburgh named William Rutherford.|$|E
25|$|Depp next {{starred in}} the Burton-directed Dark Shadows (2012) {{alongside}} fellow Tim Burton regular Helena Bonham Carter, as well as Michelle Pfeiffer and Eva Green. The film {{was based on a}} gothic soap opera of the same name, which had aired in 1966–1971 and had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> favorites as a child. Depp and Graham King produced the film with David Kennedy. In 2012, Depp and his 21 Jump Street co-stars Peter DeLuise and Holly Robinson briefly reprised their roles in cameo appearances in the series' 2012 feature film adaptation, which featured a much more comedic tone than the series.|$|E
25|$|In December 1942 Dempsey was {{promoted}} to lieutenant general to command XIII Corps of the British Eighth Army in North Africa. Montgomery, the Eighth Army commander, had first spotted Dempsey's potential when he had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> students at the Staff College. On arrival in Cairo, Egypt, Dempsey found his corps HQ in reserve because the long lines of communication to Eighth Army's spearhead could only sustain two corps (XXX Corps and X Corps). Dempsey was therefore employed in the planning of the invasion of Sicily and led his corps in the assault on Sicily in July 1943.|$|E

25|$|A {{different}} and more exuberant Baroque style with some Rococo touches, more {{reminiscent of the}} style in Central Europe, developed {{in the northern part}} of Portugal. The Italian architect Nicolau Nasoni designed the church and the spectacular granite tower of São Pedro dos Clérigos in Porto. One of his successors was the painter and architect José de Figueiredo Seixas, who had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> disciples. The sanctuary Bom Jesus do Monte near Braga, built by the architect Carlos Luis Ferreira Amarante is a notable example of a pilgrimage site with a monumental, cascading Baroque stairway that climbs 116 metres. This last example already shows the shift in style to Neo-classicism.|$|E
25|$|Graham {{attended}} Miami High School {{and graduated}} from the University of Florida in 1936, with a Bachelor of Arts degree in economics, and from Harvard Law School, where he was editor of the Harvard Law Review and earned a magna cum laude degree, in 1939. Graham {{was a member of}} both Florida Blue Key and Sigma Alpha Epsilon (Florida Upsilon chapter) and was both a fraternity brother and roommate of the late Senator George A. Smathers whom he had been close to since attending Miami High School with Smathers. In 19391940 he was law clerk to United States Supreme Court Justice Stanley F. Reed, and the following year he was clerk to Justice Felix Frankfurter, who had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> professors at Harvard.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of Ferdinand III's death in 1634, the war was {{progressing}} disastrously for the Habsburgs, and his son Ferdinand IV (1637–1657) who had <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> military commanders was faced {{with the task of}} salvaging the consequences of his father's extremism. Ferdinand IV was far more pragmatic and had been considered the leader of the peace party at court and had helped negotiate the Peace of Prague in 1635. However, with continuing losses in the war he was forced to make peace in 1648 with the Peace of Westphalia, concluding the war. One of his acts during {{the latter part of the}} war was to give further independence to the German states (ius belli ac pacis—rights in time of war and peace) which would gradually change the balance of power between emperor and states in favour of the latter.|$|E

25|$|Shaftesbury's amiability of {{character}} {{seems to have}} <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> principal characteristics. Like Locke he had a peculiar pleasure in bringing forward young men. Among these may be especially mentioned Michael Ainsworth, a native of Wimborne St Giles, {{the young man who}} was the recipient of the Letters addressed to a student at the university, and was maintained by Shaftesbury at University College, Oxford. The interest which Shaftesbury took in his studies, and the desire that he should be specially fitted for the profession which he had selected, that of a clergyman of the Church of England, are marked features of the letters. Other protegés were Crell, a young Pole, the two young Furlys and Harry Wilkinson, a boy who was sent into Furly's office at Rotterdam, and to whom several of the letters still extant in the Record Office are addressed.|$|E
25|$|From then on, Schiele {{participated in}} {{numerous}} group exhibitions, {{including those of}} the Neukunstgruppe in Prague in 1910 and Budapest in 1912; the Sonderbund, Cologne, in 1912; and several Secessionist shows in Munich, beginning in 1911. In 1911, Schiele met the seventeen-year-old Walburga (Wally) Neuzil, who lived with him in Vienna and served as a model for some of his most striking paintings. Very little is known of her, except that she had previously modelled for Gustav Klimt and might have <b>been</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mistresses. Schiele and Wally wanted to escape what they perceived as the claustrophobic Viennese milieu, and went to the small town of Český Krumlov (Krumau) in southern Bohemia. Krumau was the birthplace of Schiele's mother; today it is the site of a museum dedicated to Schiele. Despite Schiele's family connections in Krumau, he and his lover were driven out of the town by the residents, who strongly disapproved of their lifestyle, including his alleged employment of the town's teenage girls as models. Progressively, Schiele's work grew more complex and thematic, and he eventually would begin dealing with themes such as death and rebirth.|$|E
