In 1906 nitrocellulose adhesives were introduced, being replaced in 1949 by polychloroprene adhesives (PCP), which due to their versatility present good results in leather <b>bonding,</b> <b>textiles</b> and other materials. In 1970 the PU adhesives are then introduced in the footwear industry. Subsequently adhesives based on styrene-isoprene-styrene (SIS), styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), styrene-butadiene rubber (SBR), latex, aqueous dispersions and hotmelts were used [4]. However, for the bonding of upper/soles, adhesives used are based on PCP and PU.

Two types of aerated concrete: {{autoclaved aerated concrete}} (AAC) and polymeric Fiber-Reinforced Aerated Concrete (FRAC) were used as the core material. Skin layer consisted of two layers of Alkali Resistant Glass (ARG) textiles and a cementitious binder. Performance of ductile skin-brittle core (TRC-AAC) and ductile skin-ductile core (TRC-FRAC) composites was evaluated in terms of flexural stiffness, strength, and energy absorption capacity. The effect of impact energy on the mechanical properties was measured at various drop heights on two different cross-sections using energy levels up to 40 J and intermediate strain rates up to 20 s(- 1). The externally <b>bonded</b> <b>textile</b> layers significantly improved the mechanical properties of light-weight low-strength aerated concrete core under both loading modes.

40|$|Throughout {{the past}} decades {{hospitals}} have been facing {{a major challenge}} concerning the growing multi-drug microbial resistance, especially in immunodepressed patients. The development of antimicrobial textiles offers a promising solution {{in the prevention of}} infections in clinical settings since microbial shedding from our body contributes to microorganism spreading into a textile material, either directly in clothes or on surrounding textiles. The use of some chemical antimicrobial agents in textiles has already been tested, as for example quaternaryammonium- compounds (QACs), biguanidines, silver, triclosan, and N-halamines. However, these have proved to be of limited clinical applicability. They exhibit some cytotoxicity causing some irritation of the skin, toxicity to the environment and, except for silver and N-halamines, exhibit a reduced spectrum of microbial inhibition thus bringing about microbial resistance. Besides, with the exception of QACs, which establish durable <b>bonds</b> with <b>textiles,</b> they gradually lose their bioactivity with use and laundering. Therefore a new strategy to develop non-toxic antimicrobial textiles without microbial resistance side-effects are hereby described.

This paper investigates the thermoplastic adhesive bonding technology. Electronic modules are <b>bonded</b> to <b>textile</b> substrates with a thermoplastic nonconductive adhesive (NCA) film. The modules are placed onto textile circuits with an NCA-film inbetween. By applying pressure and heat, the adhesive melts and contact partners touch.

Besides, it shows that the interconnection process works well with thermoplastically insulated conductors. In addition, the design of interposers has been improved in respect to contact formation and miniaturization compared to previous publications. The pitch of the contact pads is set to 1. 27 mm.

While their utilization has been well demonstrated in the laboratory, many fundamental questions remain unanswered. Questions concerning solubility and transport in SCF’s as well as those concerning the nature of the interface between the fiber and the fluid in a SCF process need to be addressed. In textile applications, since a SCF, like a gas, does not exhibit a surface tension, is there an interfacial tension at the fiber-fluid boundary? A related question concerns the nature of the SCF solution within the fiber. One of the goals of this research is to provide the fundamental data necessary to answer these questions. A second goal of this research is to identify potential chemistry which could be used for the development of covalent bond formation in SCF’s. One of the major impediments to the more widespread application of SCF processing is the limitations imposed by the use of SC CO 2.

The technique comprises external <b>bonding</b> of <b>textiles</b> on the tension face of RC slabs through the use of polymer-modified cement- based mortars. The textiles used in the experimental campaign comprised fabric meshes made of long stitch-bonded fibre rovings in two orthogonal directions. The specimens measured 2 x 2 m in plan and were supported on hinges at the corners. Three RC slabs strengthened by textile reinforced mortar (TRM) overlays and one control specimen were tested to failure. One specimen received one layer of carbon fibre textile, another one received two, whereas the third specimen was strengthened with three layers of glass fibre textile having the same axial rigidity (in both directions) with the single-layered carbon fibre textile. All specimens failed due to flexural punching. The load-carrying capacity of the strengthened slabs was increased by 26 %, 53 %, and 20 % over that of the control specimen for slabs with one (carbon), two (carbon) and three (glass) textile layers, respectively. The strengthened slabs showed an increase in stiffness and energy absorption.

In this approach the role of interface properties which are instrumental in the simulation of the tensile response is investigated. The model simulates the tension stiffening effect of cracked matrix, and evolution of crack spacing in tensile members. Independent experimental results obtained from literature are used to verify the model and develop composite tensile stress strain response using alkali resistant (AR) glass textile reinforced concrete. The composite stress strain response is then used with a bilinear representation of the composite obtained from the tensile stiffening model.

40|$|Smart {{textiles}} are {{an expanding}} field with much potential and arouse {{interest in the}} R&D sphere and industry. These find vast applications in engineering, healthcare and fashion, and contribute additional functionality and intelligence to structures. Quiet often the intelligence of such smart structures is supported by electronics that ensure functions such as data transfer and analysis for monitoring systems. Moreover, many smart textile systems require also energy source. At present, {{there is a great}} variety of scenarios to implement the joining of the functional textile compounds and electronics. Nevertheless, the joining technology is one the key challenges for smart textile developers, especially regarding wearable applications. Smart luminous textiles are of great interest for applications such as clothing and interior design and visual merchandizing. Moreover, luminous textiles are beneficial for protective clothing and sportswear in order to insure better visibility of the wear and interactive design for non-verbal communication. Additionally, luminous textiles have potentials for healthcare and medicine applications such as phototherapy. At present, such smart textiles are mostly limited to LED integration. Despite well-developed techniques for LED attachment onto textiles, power sourcing and controlling of the electronics for more complex LED matrixes remains a field for technology improvement. Moreover, OLED technology is more preferable for some applications due to fragility of more sophisticated and large-scale LED matrixes. This study presents a preliminary study for reversible joining of textiles and electronics within a novel concept for electroluminescence (EL) towards Organic Light Emitting Devices (OLED) implementations by printing technology. Technical embroidery is suggested as a promising technology that ensures continuous manufacturing of the functional textile compounds, electro-conductive paths and the joining platforms for electronic interconnections with active textiles. A novel concept for EL is developed in order to continuously implement the functional textile elements and ensure an efficient solution for the smart <b>textile</b> <b>bonding</b> with electronics. Regarding specifics of the development usage conditions, solutions for reversible joining are in the focus of the study. Finally, a concept of the bonding module for the electro-conductive platforms is described to be applied to custom developed EL structures on textiles...|$|R
40|$|Concrete {{reinforced}} with conventional steel {{is one of}} the most commonly used building materials, yet it has historically shown disadvantages in terms of durability and vulnerability to corrosion attack. Various remedial methods have been applied to overcome the shortcomings of this building material, such as increasing the concrete cover, which, however, leads to an increased self-weight of the struc-ture. Over the past decade, Textile Reinforced Concrete (TRC), encompassing a combination of fine-grained concrete and non-corrosive multi-axial textile fabrics, has emerged as a promising novel alternative offering corrosion resistance, as well as thinner and light-weight structures such as foot bridges and façade elements. Although TRC has been extensively researched, the formalization of experimental methods and design standards is still in progress. The aim of this paper is to quantify and model the bond behaviour of TRC basalt fibre meshes. The <b>bond</b> between the <b>textile</b> fibre mesh and fine-grained concrete matrix is a critical element influencing the overall performance of this composite material. The yarn structure is rather complex including a multitude of outer and inner filaments; thus inevitably, the constituents of one yarn are unevenly bonded to the concrete matrix. As such, experiments help quantify complex material behaviour which can be further used to develop and calibrate analytical and non-linear finite-element models. The bond behaviour of TRC was characterized through means of direct pull-out tests with unsymmet-rical embedment lengths such that the test specimens were notched at a prescribed breaking point. The test specimens consisted of one-layer of reinforcement mesh, centrally cast, made of basalt fibres. The applied force and average deformation of the test specimen were measured. The evaluation of varying embedment lengths was explored in order to quantify pull-out and textile rupture failure modes. The experimental results were thereafter evaluated using an analytical 1 D bond model. Pull-out and rupture failure were observed in the experimental pull-out results. A local bond stress-slip curve was calibrated for the basalt specimens based on the experimental results. Finally, it was observed that the simulation results from the 1 D bond model had a reasonable correlation with the experimental results in spite of the complex bond behaviour of TRC...|$|R
40|$|This thesis shows {{a method}} to analyse places and bond of glass fibre {{reinforced}} concrete. Due to its very low ductility, concrete fails rapidly under tensile load. Reinforcements can increase the stability of concrete with respect to tensile loads by absorbing these loads through the bonds at areas where the concrete fails and thus preparing the building element. The quantitative bond is a measure for the transfer of tensile loads and therefore also an indirect measure for {{the stability of the}} entire building element. In most cases concrete is reinforced with steel. Steel is very expensive and corrodes because of environment conditions, an alternative reinforcement is considered which is analysed in a special research field. Textile reinforced concrete, in which the reinforcement consists of long glass fibres, is a new composite material for which this bond is not yet known. Preliminary tests have shown that non-destructive bond analyses are not feasible with the required accuracy and level of detail. This thesis presents a method for location- and <b>bond</b> analyses of <b>textile</b> reinforcement. The analyses are based on scanning electron microscopy images of successive cross-sections of textile reinforced concrete. Using image analysis techniques, the positions of the fibres are extracted and the bonds between the reinforcements and the concrete matrix are determined geometrically. After correcting for the relative orientations of the cross-sections, the components of the reinforcements are assembled to a three-dimensional model of the reinforcement. The fibres are then approximated by various functions and the results discussed to recap the trajectories of the fibres in the specimen. In addition to the position and trajectory of the reinforcements, the areas of bond are also evaluated qualitatively, extrapolated along the fibres and displayed. The results obtained through this analysis provide a basis for subsequent models for the characterization of textile reinforced concrete which are needed to explain observations from experiments on the reaction of textile reinforced concrete under tensile and bending stress. Attention is paid specifically to the correct mapping of the fibres between the cross-sections. The analysis uses classical approaches from photogrammetric and alignment theory and is performed exemplarily. This method can be ransferred to other samples without modification...|$|R
40|$|Outer fabric samples {{contained}} in hard copy {{held at the}} LibraryThis design-led research project was developed {{in collaboration with the}} Christchurch-based bedding manufacturing firm FibreTech New Zealand Limited. It explored the potential of an innovative wool-fill product developed by FibreTech. This new wool-fill maximises loft and bulk, both key factors for warmth and comfort in bedding. Loft is an active, three-dimensional feature of bedding, controlled through processes of compression and release. Retaining and managing loft was vital. The designer provided a holistic approach, using a textile design perspective to explore functionality and aesthetics in relation to the structure of the fill and outer membrane layers of bedding products. Through material sampling the project assessed how FibreTech’s new wool product could be layered and <b>bonded</b> with other <b>textiles.</b> The technical processes of needle punching, fusing and stitch bonding were used to explore the loft and compression relationship within the textiles. It was found that ratios of loft and compression could be altered to improve the efficiency of manufacturing; {{while at the same time}} optimising functionality and aesthetics. Textile design, wool knops, knoppy web, New Zealand wool, loft, overbody bedding, underbody bedding, sampling, research and development, digital quilting, computer-aided design Key words: Using the existing manufacturing process of digital quilting, stitch paths were redesigned to create an innovative range of bedding products for use over and under the body. The resulting textiles revealed a departure from classic bedding construction, with a new focus on controlling the stitch line through computer-aided design (CAD) technology. This hard-edged stitch line was a digital imposition that contrasted with the organic nature of soft, lofted materials. This visual and haptic tension was identified as key design interplay for both overbody and underbody approaches. Strategies were created towards lightweight overbody bedding and engineered shaping of underbody bedding. These new digital quilting strategies captured loft in distinctly different, yet functional ways. This project provides evidence that a textile designer can be a key contributor in the manufacturing industry, along with other disciplines such as science and engineering to add value to research and development in the New Zealand wool textile manufacturing industry. The design research progressed as a Callaghan Innovation Postgraduate Fellowship project and represents the development of a new aesthetic for wool bedding products...|$|R
40|$|The load {{elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles is decisively {{influenced by the}} surrounding soil. This influence on behaviour has previously been quantifiable only insufficiently and cannot therefore be used in current dimensioning procedures. This uncertainty leads to low coefficients of utilisation of the geotextiles in the dimensioning procedures and thus to constructions which cannot be evaluated in terms of safety and which are often not economical. With the laboratory tests 'lateral pressure device' and 'transverse force introduction', the bond behaviour of geotextiles with the surrounding soil was realistically simulated and studied. These tests provided input parameters for calculations using the finite element method (FEM). Lateral pressure devices were used to study the {{load elongation}} behaviour of geotextiles in contact with soil. These test devices {{make it possible to}} apply a tensile load to the geotextiles in the soil. The geotextile sample is fastened on two clamps; one end is held in place. At the other end the tensile force is introduced. Vertically to the geotextile level, soil layers and compressed air bellows are installed. These compressed air bellows are used to simulate the load in the construction. In the tests, various geotextile products (mechanically bonded fabrics, thermally <b>bonded</b> fabric, woven <b>textile)</b> were studied. Two different types of soil (fine gravel and coarse clay) were used. The influence of the type of soil and the soil load on the load elongation behaviour were studied. The tests showed that the deformation behaviour of the geotextiles studies is decisively characterised by the soil. The deformation module of the geotextile samples is clearly higher in the bond with the soil than in the tests without contact to the soil. This is caused by the transmission of transverse strain between soil and geotextile and by the dispersion of soil particles {{in the structure of the}} geotextiles. Thus an inner bond arises. The raw material of the geotextiles had a clear influence on the deformation behaviour. The tests showed that exceptional suitability of polyester as a reinforcement material. The transverse movement test is a modified shear test in which a geotextile reinforcement is also installed in addition to the soil material. The reinforcement is perpendicular arranged in relation to the shear joint. This test construction is used to simulate the behaviour of the geotextile/soil/bond system in the proximity of the fracture joint in reinforced steep slopes which is formed when the shear strength of the soil material is exceeded. The deformation of the geotextile which occurs under this transverse force load causes an increase in the resistance to shearing and thus an increase of the ultimate load of these bond systems. On the basis of the results of this research study, it is possible to give a plausible explanation for the good success with geotextiles as reinforcement of earthworks. This success could not be comprehended, in particular for the non wovens, from the tests without soil, the results of which are included in the current dimensioning approaches. The results of this research study can, therefore, serve as the basis for a dimensioning approach which realistically records the influence of the soil and the deformations of the bond system.
