With the present position paper they point towards {{a number of}} critical issues that need follow-up {{in the years to}} come. They recommend a shift in attention from structures to contents, and encourage the Ministers of Education to take concrete measures to ensure that the degrees within the <b>Bologna</b> <b>structure</b> are based on internationally comparable learning outcomes. Alternative learning paths have to lead to certificates with titles that differ from those of the standard Bologna degrees. Moreover they recommend that more transparency is introduced in institutional diversity, genuine support to mobility and permanent attention to the societal role of universities. They are confident that internationally attractive and competitive universities will emerge from the present process, ready to face the challenges of a globalising world...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of higher}} {{education}} (HE) as ‘soft power’ {{has a long history}} in Europe. In the contemporary policy framework, the European Union (EU) has utilised the transformative power of HE in the Eastern Partnership (EaP) via initiatives such as Erasmus Mundus, Marie Curie and Tempus to create active teaching and research partnerships with non-member states; and by doing so, it reiterates the EU’s commitment to the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) and the Bologna Process. Although laudable, these polices have had a limited effect in Belarus which has remained a laggard in its engagement with EHEA. Belarus remains a non-signatory to the Bologna Process, has limited introduction of the <b>Bologna</b> <b>structure</b> and has only partially engaged in the European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS). Student mobility from Belarus within the EHEA is poor and non-governmental HE initiatives, such as the European Humanities University (EHU), have succumbed to internal politics resulting in the formation of a ‘university in exile’. This paper explores how effective EU HE policies have been in Belarus and offers examples of initiatives with the potential to develop HE as a transformative power in the country. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the {{relationship}} between higher education, employability of graduates and students' satisfaction with their studies, drawing on European statistics, as well as on data collected at national and/or institutional level in Portugal and Sweden. Employability has been understood as a measure of higher education quality and one of the issues at stake within the Bologna process. Having this in mind, the authors try to answer three main questions: What was the baseline situation in the two countries concerning higher education systems, enrolment in higher education and graduate employability before 2007 ? Were students satisfied with their studies and professional job situation before 2007 ? Which trends is it possible to envisage - tendencies of enrolment, mobility, employment - after 2007 ? Data analysed allows these questions to be answered and provides an important comparison {{due to the fact that}} both countries started to implement the <b>Bologna</b> <b>structure</b> in 2007 and have quite different educational systems. The authors discuss if 'Bologna' makes a difference regarding graduate employability and students' satisfaction with their studies, and how the differences between the countries can be understood.

40|$|When Chalmers {{implemented}} 44 {{new international}} Master's programmes in a <b>Bologna</b> <b>structure</b> the project IMPACT was established with financing from the Chalmers foundation. The project running time {{was in the}} first round 2007 ­ 2009. The main objective of the project was to establish internationally competitive and attractive programmes for national as well as international students. The students graduating from the programmes must be competitive in an international job market. Early in the project 11 top­level goals for the project were developed in a bottom up procedure. Aiming at these goals about 100 pedagogic projects are developed, implemented and evaluated with a very strong engagement from teachers and Departments at Chalmers. For the effective progress of the project very smooth, transparent and effective administrative, application and report (web based) routines were developed. In the project around 90 % of the resources were used by direct development work or training of staff in English presentation. Every Department / Master's programme has in a continuous process in a dialogue with the project management prioritised between the top­level goals for their own effort, in their programmes. In each project the focus was on one or more top­level goals. The steering committee early focused on the immediate training of teachers in the “teaching in English” process. The focus was not only on how to speak English in front of students or to translate existing education material correctly, but also to present the material in a pedagogical way. The project will be evaluated in several ways; through presentations, project reports, workshops, student evaluation, interviews and so on...|$|R
40|$|In Sweden the HE Ordinance from 2002 {{states that}} lecturers, to get {{permanent}} positions, should have completed Compulsory HE Teacher Training (CHETT). The size and organisation {{of the courses}} were not regulated and institutional practices varied. Lund University was appointed a three year project to develop the content of CHETT, a process which lead to {{the suggestion of a}} set of learning outcomes based in scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL). In 2005, the Association of Swedish HE-institutions (SUHF) recommended all institutions to accept these outcomes. At Lund University CHETT is designed to contribute to a two-fold aim: to develop the competence of individual teachers and the social context, or the culture, in which the teachers operate. Principally, CHETT in Lund engages teachers in a scholarly inquiry into teaching and learning in their own teaching practice and field of knowledge, and can thus be viewed as a nucleus for SoTL. Furthermore, it provides a nexus for the practices of teachers, academic developers and educational researchers. Parallel to CHETT a number of initiatives have been taken to support the emergence and sustenance of an institutional culture of SoTL, such as conferences and workshops, and the introduction of pedagogical academies. With the learning outcomes for CHETT now accepted by the Swedish institutions comes the prospect of a wide national SoTL arena. This situation excitingly enough coincides with the rapid implementation of the <b>Bologna</b> <b>structure</b> in Sweden, which also calls for a qualified and research-based exchange of teacher experiences at the national level...|$|R

40|$|Several tectonic meso-structures {{have been}} {{observed}} within the Ligurian chaotic units (Argille Scagliose Auct.) included in the Pedeapennine deformed belt of the hills near <b>Bologna.</b> Similar <b>structures</b> have observed in nearly all the outcrops of the Argille Scagliose between the Reno and Sellustra Valleys, in several {{of which they are}} impressively exposed. The following are the most important observed meso-structures: — Slip planes. These structures affect the Argille Scagliose clayey matrix and develop an intense tectonic lamination. The slip-plane surfaces show striae, mechanical steps, grooves and other slip structures typical of faults in clayey rocks. — Lenticular bodies. There are clayey, marly and sandy bodies included in the Argille Scagliose matrix. They represent residual parts of previously more tabular and continuous lithozones which underwent strong flattening processes accompanied by boudinage. The strain behaviour of the various lithological types are very different. The more competent lenticular bodies display brittle systems of deformation. The observed brittle structures indicate that boudinage is the result of an extensive-flattening produced by simple shear. — Folding. Isoclinal, asymmetric and disarmonic folds have plastically deformed the slip planes. The folded zones are enclosed between unfolded levels. Two genetical interpretations are proposed based on drag mechanism and/or on pseudo-diapiric lateral injection. Owing to the presence of these structures the Argille Scagliose in the studied area may be considered as a «tectonic mélange» originated by a very pervasive deformation. This deformation is related to simple shear and pure shear stresses acting on brittle and/or visco-plastic materials. The observed structures can be mainly related to the neogenic polyphased tectonics which originated the thrust system recognized underneath the Ligurian units and across the Apennine border by subsurface geological data and reconstruction produced by AGIP...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} theory and the conducted activity {{that lead to the}} construction of a high voltage high frequency arbitrary waveform voltage generator. The generator has been specifically designed to supply power {{to a wide range of}} plasma actuators. The system has been completely designed, manufactured and tested at the Department of Electrical, Electronic and Information Engineering of the University of <b>Bologna.</b> The generator <b>structure</b> is based on the single phase cascaded H-bridge multilevel topology and is comprised of 24 elementary units that are series connected in order to form the typical staircase output voltage waveform of a multilevel converter. The total number of voltage levels that can be produced by the generator is 49. Each level is 600 V making the output peak-to-peak voltage equal to 28. 8 kV. The large number of levels provides high resolution with respect to the output voltage having thus the possibility to generate arbitrary waveforms. Maximum frequency of operation is 20 kHz. A study of the relevant literature shows that this is the first time that a cascaded multilevel converter of such dimensions has been constructed. Isolation and control challenges had to be solved for the realization of the system. The biggest problem of the current technology in power supplies for plasma actuators is load matching. Resonant converters are the most used power supplies and are seriously affected by this problem. The manufactured generator completely solves this issue providing consistent voltage output independently of the connected load. This fact is very important when executing tests and during the comparison of the results because all measures should be comparable and not dependent from matching issues. The use of the multilevel converter for power supplying a plasma actuator is a real technological breakthrough that has provided and will continue to provide very significant experimental results...|$|R
40|$|The Seismic Performance Analysis of Bridges (SPAB) {{constitutes}} one of {{the biggest}} challenges for structural and civil engineers. In fact, the handling of these design problems requires a deep knowledge of structural behavior and a huge expertise with numerical and analytical tools necessary to perform advanced Finite Element (FE) simulations including dynamic and probabilistic aspects. Within the scope of SPAB, this thesis proposes the analysis of complex bridges assisted by the profitable well-known method of Dynamic ubstructuring (DS), advanced model updating strategies, fully probabilistic approaches and innovative time integration algorithms. SPAB includes the evaluation of several nonlinear behaviors inside the structural components and the quantification of benefits generated by safety systems such as isolation devices. As a result, in order to highlight the main advantages of a well designed isolation system, most of the cases analyzed include the comparison between non isolated and isolated configurations. In greater detail, four different bridges have been analyzed and will be presented in this thesis. First, the Rio Torto highway viaduct, an existing Reinforced Concrete (RC) viaduct on the A 1 Italian highway between Florence and <b>Bologna.</b> The <b>structure</b> has been investigated at the laboratory of the Joint Research Center in Ispra (VA) by means of Hybrid Simulations (HSs). The set of 1 : 2. 5 scaled substructures included two RC frame piers and the isolation system. The critical issues of the structure due to the complexity of the geometry and the awfulness was the presence of poor seismic details characterized by plain steel rebars. Owing to lack in knowledge for this type of rebars, tests were needed to analyze the seismic response in the as built configuration and to evaluate the effectiveness of a seismic retrofitting designed with a traditional Concave Sliding Bearings (CSBs) system. Then, a typical RC bridge with an innovative prototype of Concave Sliding Bearing (CSB) has been tested at the EUCENTRE Tress Laboratory in Pavia (PV) through HSs. The set of Physical Substructures (PSs) included a 1 : 2 scaled RC box section pier and a full-scale CSB. The prototype was characterized by an asymptotic relation between friction coefficient and load rate. All the benefits of the DS were exhibited during the test; in fact, to exploit the actual potentiality of the isolation system, even with the low speed of the test, the restoring force coming from the CSB was numerically corrected at each time step. Furthermore, a short-medium span Steel Concrete Composite Bridge made with Hot rolled I-girders (SCCBH) has been investigated. The SCCBH is an example of structural optimization; in fact, it combines both economic and functional benefits deriving from the reduction of in site works, e. g. welding, and short construction time. In particular, The novelties were threefold: i) the testing of a novel connection between a steel I-girder and a Concrete Cross Beam (CCB); ii) the development of a novel mechanical model for this connections; iii) the application of the Performance Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE) to SCCBH. The experimental campaign has been performed on six 1 : 2 scaled substructures, representing a deck subassembly, tested in both longitudinal and transverse loading directions. Finally, a simulation-based reliability assessment of a complex cable-stayed foot/cyclic bridge located close to the sea and equipped with dynamic viscous dampers was performed. The scope was to investigate the benefits of Circular Hollow Section (CHS) structural members for this type of structure when erected in an aggressive environment. A FE model of the structure has been validated, and then used to perform a probabilistic time dependent analysis. Therefore, two corrosion models, i. e. general and localized, capable of evaluating the reduced load bearing section were implemented; and appropriate probability distribution functions were assigned to input model parameters to evaluate the response of the facility during its service life. As a result, the time dependent probabilities of failure have been evaluated and compared with the codes prescriptions. ...|$|R
40|$|The Northern Apennines (NA) {{chain is}} the {{expression}} of the active plate margin between Europe and Adria. Given the low convergence rates and the moderate seismic activity, ambiguities still occur in defining a seismotectonic framework and many different scenarios have been proposed for the mountain front evolution. Differently from older models that indicate the mountain front as an active thrust at the surface, a recently proposed scenario describes the latter as the frontal limb of a long-wavelength fold (> 150 km) formed by a thrust fault tipped around 17 km at depth, and considered as the active subduction boundary. East of Bologna, this frontal limb is remarkably very straight and its surface is riddled with small, but pervasive high- angle normal faults. However, west of Bologna, some recesses are visible along strike of the mountain front: these perturbations seem due to the presence of shorter wavelength (15 to 25 km along strike) structures showing both NE and NW-vergence. The Pleistocene activity of these structures was already suggested, but not quantitative reconstructions are available in literature. This research investigates the tectonic geomorphology of the NA mountain front with the specific aim to quantify active deformations and infer possible deep causes of both short- and long-wavelength structures. This study documents the presence of a network of active extensional faults, in the foothills south and east of <b>Bologna.</b> For these <b>structures,</b> the strain rate has been measured to find a constant throw-to-length relationship and the slip rates have been compared with measured rates of erosion. Fluvial geomorphology and quantitative analysis of the topography document in detail the active tectonics of two growing domal structures (Castelvetro - Vignola foothills and the Ghiardo plateau) embedded in the mountain front west of Bologna. Here, tilting and river incision rates (interpreted as that long-term uplift rates) have been measured respectively at the mountain front and in the Enza and Panaro valleys, using a well defined stratigraphy of Pleistocene to Holocene river terraces and alluvial fan deposits as growth strata, and seismic reflection profiles relationships. The geometry and uplift rates of the anticlines constrain a simple trishear fault propagation folding model that inverts for blind thrust ramp depth, dip, and slip. Topographic swath profiles and the steepness index of river longitudinal profiles that traverse the anti- clines are consistent with stratigraphy, structures, aquifer geometry, and seismic reflection profiles. Available focal mechanisms of earthquakes with magnitude between Mw 4. 1 to 5. 4, obtained from a dataset of the instrumental seismicity for the last 30 years, evidence a clear vertical separation at around 15 km between shallow extensional and deeper compressional hypocenters along the mountain front and adjacent foothills. In summary, the studied anticlines appear to grow at rates slower than the growing rate of the longer- wavelength structure that defines the mountain front of the NA. The domal structures show evidences of NW-verging deformation and reactivations of older (late Neogene) thrusts. The reconstructed river incision rates together with rates coming from several other rivers along a 250 km wide stretch of the NA mountain front and recently available in the literature, all indicate a general increase from Middle to Late Pleistocene. This suggests focusing of deformation along a deep structure, as confirmed by the deep compressional seismicity. The maximum rate is however not constant along the mountain front, but varies from 0. 2 mm/yr in the west to more than 2. 2 mm/yr in the eastern sector, suggesting a similar (eastward-increasing) trend of the apenninic subduction...|$|R
