5|$|The testing {{showed that}} the <b>base</b> <b>layer</b> onto which the codex was painted is {{composed}} of gypsum, a material used as a <b>base</b> <b>layer</b> for paintings since antiquity. The black paint was analysed with RBS and {{found to be a}} carbon-based pigment consistent with other pre-Columbian Mexican codices. The red colour used in the codex is red ochre, an iron-based pigment. There is very little blue colouration in the Grolier Codex and the presence of the distinctive Maya Blue pigment could not be confirmed. Analysis by particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE) revealed the blue pigment used on the codex does not contain cobalt and does contain clay. Its elemental composition matches that of palygorskite, the main inorganic component of Maya Blue. However, some other materials such as lapis lazuli could not be ruled out since PIXE only identifies elements, not compounds. The investigators concluded that the codex does contain some original pre-Columbian materials but could not confirm that the document is authentic.|$|E

25|$|One of the {{commonly}} used tone mapping algorithms is the iCAM06 {{which is based}} on both the color appearance model and hierarchical mapping. After bilateral filtering, the image is broken into a <b>base</b> <b>layer</b> and a detail layer. White point adaptation and chrominance adaptation are applied to the <b>base</b> <b>layer,</b> while detail enhancement is applied to the detail layer. Eventually the two layers are merged and converted to the IPT color space. In general, this method is good but has some shortcomings, specifically in how computationally heavy the filtering method is. A proposed solution to this involves performance optimization of the filter. The <b>base</b> <b>layer</b> of the image is also converted to the RGB space for tone compression. This method also allows for more output adjustment and saturation enhancement, making it be less computationally intensive and better at reducing the overall halo effect.|$|E

40|$|The goal {{of image}} fusion is {{to obtain a}} fused image that {{contains}} most significant information in all input images which were captured by different sensors from the same scene. In particular, the fusion process should improve the contrast and keep the integrity of significant features from input images. In this paper, we propose a region-based image fusion method to fuse spatially registered visible and infrared images while improving the contrast and preserving the significant features of input images. At first, the proposed method decomposes input images into <b>base</b> <b>layers</b> and detail layers using a bilateral filter. Then the <b>base</b> <b>layers</b> of the input images are segmented into regions. Third, a region-based decision map is proposed to represent the importance of every region. The decision map is obtained by calculating the weights of regions according to the gray-level difference between each region and its neighboring regions in the <b>base</b> <b>layers.</b> At last, the detail <b>layers</b> and the <b>base</b> <b>layers</b> are separately fused by different fusion rules {{based on the same}} decision map to generate a final fused image. Experimental results qualitatively and quantitatively demonstrate that the proposed method can improve the contrast of fused images and preserve more features of input images than several previous image fusion methods...|$|R

The cover of the capsule is hydrophilised through introducing hydrophilised or amphiphilised components. The metal <b>based</b> <b>layer</b> system is produced through adding the capsules having capsule cover and capsule core, to an electrolyte, and depositing the layer system of metal or alloy layers on the substrate by electrolytes in galvanic- or external flow-less manner. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The metal <b>based</b> <b>layer</b> system comprises a substrate and a layer system having metal layer or alloy layer applied on the substrate, where capsules are dispersed in the metal layer or alloy layer of the layer system. The cover of the capsule is hydrophilised through introducing hydrophilised or amphiphilised components. The metal <b>based</b> <b>layer</b> system is produced through adding the capsules having capsule cover and capsule core, to an electrolyte, depositing the layer system of metal or alloy layers on the substrate by electrolytes in galvanic- or external flow-less manner, and adding the amphiphilised components such as surfactant, to the electrolyte before and/or during the galvanic deposition. The metal- or alloy layer is produced through galvanic deposition. The capsule cover is formed from polymer and the polymer formation is carried out by amphiphile monomer. The hydrophilic molecule part of the amphiphile monomer is formed by organic residues that consist of polar heteroatom, and/or hydrophobic molecule part of the amphiphile monomer is formed from aliphatic or aromatic residues. The additional hydrophilic component is covalently bounded on the polymer and/or amphiphile monomer. The binding is carried out over functional groups having organic residues that are formed for the reaction with amphiphile monomer without the polymerization ability. The additional hydrophilic component is hydrophilic alcohol and the monomer is a-butyl cyanoacrylate. The hydrophilic alcohol is bound through transesterification of the cyanoacrylate. A chemical and/or physical reaction is carried out with metal layer or the alloy layer and/or with moisture in environment in damage and/or destruction of the capsule of the material of the capsule core and/or the capsule cover. The average capsule diameter is 0. 1 - 0. 5 mu m. The capsule diameter of the individual capsule from average capsule diameter is maximum threefold standard deviation of the average diameter. The capsules are homogenously dispersed in the metal or metal alloy layer. The thickness of the metal layer or alloy layer is 1 - 200 mu m and/or the capsule has a volume portion of 5 - 80 %.
