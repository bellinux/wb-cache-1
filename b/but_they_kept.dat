These counter-attacks usually failed to recover ground, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> the Red Army off-balance and won Model time {{to pull his}} units back.

Smith's New York battery was under severe pressure from three sides, but its supporting infantry regiments were suffering severe casualties and could not protect it. Three 10-pound Parrott rifles were lost to the 1st Texas, and they were used against Union troops the next day.|$|E

25|$|Following the 5 May attack, the Mission and its {{garrison}} remained {{under constant}} {{fire from the}} Jong. The Tibetans' weapons may have been inefficient and primitive <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> up a constant pressure and fatalities were an irregular but nagging reality; a fatality on 6 May was followed by another eleven in the seven weeks after the surprise attack on Changlo Manor. The garrison responded with its own attacks; some of the Mounted Infantry returned from Karo La, armed with new standard-issue Lee–Enfield rifles, and pursued Tibetan horsemen, {{and one of the}} Maxims was stationed on the roof and short bursts of machine-gun fire met targets as they appeared {{on the walls of the}} Jong.|$|E

2500|$|On 7 August 2008, the 4th brigade loaded {{tanks and}} missile {{launchers}} {{on a train}} bound for the Georgian city of Gori. On the night of 7–8 August, the 4th Brigade launched a three-pronged offensive on South Ossetian positions in Tskhinvali and in two Ossetian villages - Znauri and Khetagurovo. One of the assaults intended to divert South Ossetian militia forces away from the main objective. After Tskhinvali was nearly encircled, Georgian troops then tried to establish control over a key road to the north, one mid-ranking commander said. The road was being defended by South Ossetian garrison {{near the village of}} Tbeti. As Georgian soldiers were engaged with the South Ossetian garrison, the first Russian tanks appeared, the commander said. [...] "We destroyed one tank after another, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> coming," [...] the anonymous commander said.|$|E
2500|$|A {{retrospective}} review from AllMusic {{noted that}} Return to Base [...] "marks Slade's low ebb {{in terms of}} popularity and morale", and were mixed in their reception to the album, rating it two stars out of five and noting the album was [...] "certainly not a high point for the band, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> on keepin' on, {{no matter how bad}} things got. Secure in the knowledge that practically no one had ever heard the thing, Slade eventually redid the record as We'll Bring the House Down, a fully realized project." [...] In early 2010, Classic Rock considered the album [...] "superior, reputation cementing" [...] and wrote: [...] "We'll Bring the House Down was cobbled together quickly after the band's Reading triumph, largely from the contents of their previous (overlooked) album, Return to Base." [...] Colin Harper of Record Collector said: [...] "Searching for the UK zeitgeist, 1979's now abjectly obscure Return to Base ironically had a pleasingly diverse, reinvigorated musical palette." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} the {{controversy}} surrounding both his tenure and dismissal, Schlesinger was by most accounts an able secretary of defense. A serious and perceptive thinker on nuclear strategy, he was determined that the United States not fall seriously behind the Soviet Union in conventional and nuclear forces and devoted himself to modernization of defense policies and programs. He got along well with the military leadership because he proposed to give them more resources, consulted with them regularly, and shared many of their views. [...] Because he was a forthright speaker who could be blunt in his opinions and did not enjoy the personal rapport with legislators that prior Secretary of Defense Melvin Laird had, his relations with Congress were often strained. A majority of its members may have approved Schlesinger's strategic plans, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> a tight rein on the money for his programs. As for the Pentagon bureaucracy, Schlesinger generally left its management to Deputy Secretary of Defense William P. Clements.|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, the Germans counter-attacked and the MDS {{was surrounded}} {{on three sides}} with the nearest German forces only [...] away, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> on operating. Over the next few days, the front line was very fluid {{and it was not}} unknown for the unit's ambulances returning to the MDS from battalion aid posts to drive through German patrols and positions. Being co-located with brigade headquarters, the MDS could not be given the protection of the Red Cross and was subjected to small arms and artillery fire. It was also twice attacked by Royal Air Force rocket firing Typhoons. On 18 June during a German artillery attack, all the unit's transport, apart from one ambulance jeep and two captured trucks, were destroyed. After the last attack, Brigade headquarters issued orders for the MDS to move further to the rear at Ecarde. Between the 6 and 19 of June, the MDS had treated 800 wounded and carried out 112 surgical operations.|$|E
2500|$|The Canadians arrived 17 February at 3:00pm. [...] Their {{goal was}} to advance toward Hill 404. On their way, they were flanked on both sides but managed to {{continue}} up to the hill to have the high ground on the enemy for Operation Killer. On 21 February, the Patricias left the small village of Sangsok and headed north to their assigned objective of a new hill called Hill 419. This hill was defended by the Chinese. The Patricias D Company led by Captain J.G. Turnbull were to attack but the ridge of the hill gave an easy line of sight for the Chinese. The Canadians took fire from every direction from cannons, rockets and small arms fire. They were under intense fire. Their attack was postponed for 36 hours <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> up aggressive patrols and eventually the Australians gained control of Hill 619. The Australians taking Hill 619 made the Chinese leave Hill 419 and the Canadians took the hill without serious opposition. From 21 to 28 February, the Patricias suffered 10 killed and more than 21 wounded. The operation ended on 6 March 1951.|$|E

2500|$|The Revolution meant {{an end to}} {{arbitrary}} royal rule, {{and held}} out the promise of rule by law under a constitutional order, {{but it did not}} rule out a monarch. Napoleon as emperor set up a constitutional system (although he remained in full control), and the restored Bourbons were forced to go along with one. After the abdication of Napoleon III in 1871, the monarchists probably had a voting majority, but they were so factionalised they could not agree on who should be king, and instead the French Third Republic was launched with a deep commitment to upholding the ideals of the Revolution. The conservative Catholic enemies of the Revolution came to power in Vichy France (1940–44), and tried with little success to undo its heritage, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> it a republic. Vichy denied the principle of equality and tried to replace the Revolutionary watchwords [...] "Liberty, Equality, Fraternity" [...] with [...] "Work, Family, and Fatherland." [...] However, there were no efforts by the Bourbons, Vichy or anyone else to restore the privileges that had been stripped away from the nobility in 1789. France permanently became a society of equals under the law.|$|E
2500|$|The People's Republic of China {{had issued}} {{warnings}} {{that they would}} intervene if any non-South Korean forces crossed the 38th parallel, citing national security interests. Truman regarded the warnings as [...] "a bold attempt to blackmail the UN". On October 8, 1950, the day after American troops crossed the parallel, Chairman Mao issued the order for the NEFF to be moved to the Yalu River, ready to cross. Mao Zedong sought Soviet aid and saw intervention as essentially defensive: [...] "If we allow the U.S. to occupy all of Korea... we must {{be prepared for the}} US to declare... war with China", he told Joseph Stalin. Premier Zhou Enlai was sent to Moscow to add force to Mao's cabled arguments. Mao delayed his forces while waiting for Soviet help, and the planned attack was thus postponed from 13 October to 19 October. Soviet assistance was limited to providing air support no closer than 60 miles (96km) from the battlefront. The MiG-15s in PRC colours would be an unpleasant surprise to the UN pilots; they would hold local air superiority against the F-80 Shooting Stars until newer F-86 Sabres were deployed. The Soviet role was known to the U.S. <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> quiet to avoid any international and potential nuclear incidents. It has been alleged by the Chinese that the Soviets had agreed to full scale air support, which never occurred south of Pyongyang, and helped accelerate the Sino-Soviet Split.|$|E
2500|$|Although she {{canceled}} the bridge, Palin spent $25 {{million from the}} $223 million earmark to build the road on Gravina Island to an empty beach where the bridge would have gone. State officials said [...] "they were going ahead with the $25 million road because the money would otherwise have {{to be returned to}} the federal government." [...] The cancellation of the bridge did not lead Palin to return any of the remaining $197 million in the earmark to the Federal Government. Palin's Ketchikan campaign coordinator Mike Elerding, says, [...] "She said 'thanks but no thanks,' <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>kept</b> the money." [...] According to Palin’s communications director Bill McAlister, the bridge [...] "isn't necessarily dead"; it may still be built with [...] "a less costly design". Palin changed her mind on the bridge, he said, when [...] "she saw that Alaska was being perceived as taking from the country and not giving, and that impression bothered her and she wants to change it. [...] I think that Sarah Palin is someone who has the courage to re-evaluate situations as they developed." [...] Palin said through her spokesperson that the road would open territory for development. A McCain-Palin spokesperson said that [...] "because the contract for the road was already signed before she got into office, the governor was left no viable alternative." [...] The Alaska Department of Transportation and the Federal Highway Administration state that the contract could have been cancelled at minimal cost and that the federal money could have been returned to Congress for other uses, if the road had been cancelled when Palin took office in December 2006, but the bridge to the island was not cancelled until September 2007.|$|E
