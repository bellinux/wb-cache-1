5|$|At {{some point}} between 1935 and 1938, NY3 was {{truncated}} further to end at its junction with US104 in Hannibal. It was moved another half-mile (0.8km) {{to the east}} in the early 1960s following {{the completion of the}} super two bypass carrying US104 around {{the eastern edge of the}} village. NY3 continued to end at the super two until the early 1980s. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY3's former routing between the Cayuga County line and NY104 was transferred from Oswego County to the state of New York. One year later, on April1, 1981, the state assumed ownership and maintenance of the Cayuga County portion from that county. Both transactions were part of larger highway maintenance swaps <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two counties. NY3 was reextended westward to NY104A following the second swap.|$|E
5|$|What became NY319 was {{originally}} built {{during the early}} 19th century as the Norwich and Preston Turnpike, one of many privately maintained turnpikes {{in the state of}} New York. The state of New York assumed ownership of the turnpike's routing in the early 20th century, and the Preston–Norwich state highway was designated as NY319 as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Maintenance of NY319 was split <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city of Norwich, with the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) handling the part of the route west of the city limits.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A. (Political Studies)) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2011 This thesis {{examines}} <b>the</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> {{civil society}} in Zimbabwe. <b>The</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil society is discussed under the categories of the concepts democratisation, good governance and sustainable development. The nature of <b>the</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> {{civil society in}} Africa is examined to set out parameters for state-civil society debate in Zimbabwe. The discussion of <b>the</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil society in Zimbabwe is synthesised into three parts, the post-independence era, the post- 1990 s and the post- 2000. From these discussions {{it is argued that}} <b>the</b> relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil society was peaceful {{in the first decade of}} independence and this was because <b>the</b> <b>state</b> maintained dominance <b>and</b> control over all sectors of civil society. However, the 1990 s saw a collapse of peaceful relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil society in Zimbabwe. The collapse of <b>the</b> peaceful relationship <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil society came as a result of the country’s economic decline and the authoritarian practices in Zimbabwe, which saw the emergence of a confrontational civil society towards <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> In <b>the</b> early 2000 s, it is observed that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> became repressive towards civil society through the introduction of repressive laws which include Access to Information and Privacy Act (AIIPA) and the Public Order and Security Act (POSA). For peaceful relations <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> civil society to exist in a sustainable manner, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> must continuously promote and practice democracy and good governance. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> should play a pivotal role of enhancing sustainable development in a manner that meets the socio-economic realities of its population. Master...|$|R

25|$|Politically, the Draka {{state is}} {{described}} as 'aristocratic republic' with a parliamentary system of government. The Archon {{is the head of}} state appointed for a 20-year term by a parliament (elected in free and fair elections). Draka citizens have a considerable degree of free speech, but fundamental criticism of the slave system is forbidden. The Draka economy is heavily dominated by cartels known as Combines, with ownership split <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Landholders' League (Citizens can only own the right to use land, not the land itself, which can be confiscated in the event of neglect or misuse). There is also a considerable small-business private sector. The Draka economy is on the gold standard, with the basic unit of currency being the Auric. In the third novel, with gold becoming plentiful due to imports from space, the Draka switch to the Auric reflecting a basket of commodities.|$|E
25|$|In {{a medieval}} {{state with a}} strong link <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Church, as in Moravian Serbia, a canonization was not only an ecclesiastical act. It also had a social significance. After two centuries of rule of the Nemanjić dynasty, most members of which were canonized, Lazar was the first lay person to be {{recognized}} as a saint. During his lifetime, he had achieved considerable prestige as the major lord on the territory of the former Serbian Empire. The Church saw him as the only ruler worthy and capable of succeeding the Nemanjićs and restoring their state. His death was seen as a turning point in Serbian history. The aftermath of the Battle of Kosovo was felt in Serbia almost immediately, although more significant in the long run was the Battle of Marica eighteen years earlier, as the defeat of the Mrnjavčević brothers in it opened up the Balkans to the Turks.|$|E

25|$|After {{the initial}} {{conflicts}} <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> new emerging religion, Gallienus (ruled 253 to 260) {{was the first}} emperor to issue an edict of toleration for all religious creeds including Christianity. According to Christian polemicists writing after his death, Constantine I was baptized on his deathbed, which would make him the first emperor to become a baptized Christian. Eusebius, a contemporary Christian historian, also praises him for having some pagan temples torn down. Nevertheless, whatever the imperial edicts said, the effects of policy under the Christian emperors down to Valentinian I and Valens were enough to cause a widespread trend to Christian conversion, {{but not enough to}} make paganism extinct. Actual persecution was sporadic and generally the result of local initiative, for example Martin of Tours' destructions of holy sites in Gaul in the later fourth century. Official orders may have established an understanding that actual persecution would be tolerated, but in the first century of official Christianity did not generally organize it.|$|E
25|$|NY190 was {{assigned}} {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York to an east–west highway extending from NY374 in The Forge to US11 in Ellenburg by way of Ellenburg Center. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of NY190 from NY374 eastward to its junction with Star Road southwest of Ellenburg was transferred from the state of New York to Franklin and Clinton counties as part of a pair of highway maintenance swaps <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> two counties. In return, the state assumed maintenance of Star Road, an east–west road linking NY374 in Brainardsville to NY190, and Military Turnpike, a highway connecting Ellenburg to NY3 in the town of Plattsburgh. Both highways became part of a reconfigured NY190, which now began in Brainardsville and ended west of the city of Plattsburgh. As a result of the realignment, NY190 no longer directly connected to US11 in Ellenburg; instead, the connection was now made by way of NY971L, an unsigned reference route. The former routing of NY190 west of Star Road is designated as CR54 in Franklin County and CR5 in Clinton County.|$|E

The Mamluks relied on the Bedouin as auxiliary troops and were wary of their unstable, but much-needed, loyalty to the state, and referred to the iqtaʿat of the amir al-ʿarab as an [...] "iqtaʿ iʿtidād (fief of reliance). This status officially precluded the Bedouin from the military service required of iqtaʿ-holders, indicating [...] "a special relationship" [...] <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Bedouin, according to historian Tsugato Sato.

500|$|The {{preparations}} for the millennial celebrations begun with the Great Novena of 1957, which marked a nine years period of fast and prayer. In 1966, the People's Republic of Poland witnessed large festivities on the 1,000-year anniversary of those events, with the Church celebrating the 1,000 years of Christianity in Poland, while the Communist government celebrated the secular 1,000 years of the Polish State, culminated in twice denying Pope Paul VI permission to visit Poland that year. The Communist state's desire to separate religion from the state made the festivities a culture clash <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Church. While the Church was focusing on the religious, ecclesiastical aspects of the baptism, with slogans (in Latin) like Sacrum Poloniae Millenium (Poland's Sacred Millennium) the Communist Party was framing the celebrations as a secular, political anniversary {{of the creation of}} the Polish state, with slogans (in Polish) like Tysiąclecie Państwa Polskiego (A Thousand Years of the Polish State).

500|$|The {{result of}} this {{environment}} was the lapse of the Licensing Act. In November 1694, a committee was appointed by the Commons to see what laws were [...] "lately expired and expiring [...] fit to be revived and continued". The Committee reported in January 1695, and suggested the renewal of the Licensing Act; this {{was included in the}} [...] "Continuation Bill", but rejected by the House of Commons on 11 February. When it reached the House of Lords, the Lords re-included the Licensing Act, and returned the bill to the Commons. In response, a second committee was appointed - this one to produce a report indicating why the Commons disagreed with the inclusion of the Licensing Act, and chaired by Edward Clarke. This committee soon reported to the Commons, and Clarke was ordered to carry a message to the Lords requesting a conference over the Act. On 18 April 1695, Clarke met with representatives of the Lords, and they agreed to allow the Continuation Bill to pass without the renewal of the Licensing Act. With this, [...] "the Lords' decision heralded an end to a relationship that had developed throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Company of Stationers", ending both nascent publishers' copyright and the existing system of censorship.|$|E
500|$|In his 1910 book, The Constitutional Law of the United States, Westel W.

By assuming jurisdiction in these cases, Willoughby claimed, the court had given elective offices standing as property. Accordingly, Justice Joseph McKenna issued a separate concurring opinion in which he stated: [...] "I agree fully with those decisions which are referred to , and which hold that as <b>between</b> <b>the</b> <b>State</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> office holder there is no contract right either to the term of office or {{to the amount of}} salary, and that the legislature may, if not restrained by constitutional provisions, abolish the office or reduce the salary. But when the office is not disturbed, when the salary is not changed, and when, under the Constitution of the State, neither can be by the legislature, and the question is simply whether one shall be deprived of that office and its salary, and both given to another, a different question is presented, and in such a case to hold that the incumbent has no property in the office, with its accompanying salary, does not commend itself to my judgment." ...|$|E
