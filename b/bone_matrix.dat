5|$|Calcium ions may be {{complexed}} by proteins through binding the {{carboxyl groups}} of glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues; through interacting with phosphorylated serine, tyrosine, or threonine residues; or by being chelated by γ-carboxylated amino acid residues. Trypsin, a digestive enzyme, uses the first method; osteocalcin, a <b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> protein, uses the third. Some other <b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> proteins such as osteopontin and bone sialoprotein use both {{the first and}} the second. Direct activation of enzymes by binding calcium is common; some other enzymes are activated by noncovalent association with direct calcium-binding enzymes. Calcium also binds to the phospholipid layer of the cell membrane, anchoring proteins associated with the cell surface. As an example of the wide range of solubility of calcium compounds, monocalcium phosphate is very soluble in water, 85% of extracellular calcium is as dicalcium phosphate with a solubility of 2.0mM and the hydroxyapatite of bones in an organic matrix is tricalcium phosphate at 100µM.|$|E
5|$|OCD {{occurs when}} a loose piece of bone or {{cartilage}} partially (or fully) separates {{from the end of}} the bone, often because of a loss of blood supply (osteonecrosis) and decalcification of the trabecular <b>bone</b> <b>matrix.</b> The loose piece may stay in place or slide around, making the joint stiff and unstable. OCD in humans most commonly affects the knees, ankles, and elbow but can affect any joint.|$|E
5|$|Linezolid has low {{plasma protein}} binding (approximately 31%, but highly variable) and an {{apparent}} volume of distribution at steady state of around 40–50liters. Peak serum concentrations (Cmax) are reached {{one to two}} hours after administration of the drug. Linezolid is readily distributed to all tissues in the body apart from <b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> and white adipose tissue. Notably, the concentration of linezolid in the epithelial lining fluid of the lower respiratory tract is at least equal to, and often higher than, that achieved in serum (some authors have reported bronchial fluid concentrations up to four times higher than serum concentrations), which may account for its efficacy in treating pneumonia. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) concentrations vary; peak CSF concentrations are lower than serum ones, due to slow diffusion across the blood–brain barrier, and trough concentrations in the CSF are higher for the same reason. The average half-life is three hours in children, four hours in teenagers, and five hours in adults.|$|E

5|$|In the March 2005 {{issue of}} Science, Mary Higby Schweitzer of North Carolina State University and colleagues {{announced}} {{the recovery of}} soft tissue from the marrow cavity of a fossilized leg bone from a Tyrannosaurus rex. The bone had been intentionally, though reluctantly, broken for shipping and then not preserved in the normal manner, specifically because Schweitzer was hoping to test it for soft tissue. Designated as the Museum of the Rockies specimen 1125, or MOR 1125, the dinosaur was previously excavated from the Hell Creek Formation. Flexible, bifurcating blood vessels and fibrous but elastic <b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> tissue were recognized. In addition, microstructures resembling blood cells were found inside the matrix and vessels. The structures bear resemblance to ostrich blood cells and vessels. Whether an unknown process, distinct from normal fossilization, preserved the material, or the material is original, the researchers do not know, and they are careful not to make any claims about preservation. If it {{is found to be}} original material, any surviving proteins may be used as a means of indirectly guessing some of the DNA content of the dinosaurs involved, because each protein is typically created by a specific gene. The absence of previous finds {{may be the result of}} people assuming preserved tissue was impossible, therefore not looking. Since the first, two more tyrannosaurs and a hadrosaur have also been found to have such tissue-like structures. Research on some of the tissues involved has suggested that birds are closer relatives to tyrannosaurs than other modern animals.|$|E

Thirty-five bone defects were created in the parietal bone of 20 New Zealand White rabbits. In the experimental groups, 5 defects were grafted with endochondral bone, 5 with endochondral bone mixed with DBM(IM)) (EC-DBM(IM)), 5 with intramembranous bone mixed with DBM(IM) (IM-DBM(IM)) and 6 with endochondral bone mixed with DBM(EC) (EC-DBM(EC)). In the control groups, 10 defects were left alone (passive control) and 4 were grafted with rabbit skin collagen (active control). They were all killed on day 14 and the defects were prepared for histological study. Serial sections were cut across the whole defect. Quantitative analyses were made on 202 sections of the experimental groups by image analysis. A total of 414 %, 708 %, and 85 % more new bone was formed in defects grafted with composite EC-DBM(IM), IM-DBM(IM) and EC-DBM(EC), respectively, than those grafted with endochondral bone alone (P< 0. 001). No bone was formed in either passive or active controls.

25|$|Bone {{volume is}} {{determined}} by the rates of bone formation and bone resorption. Recent research has suggested that certain growth factors may work to locally alter bone formation by increasing osteoblast activity. Numerous bone-derived growth factors have been isolated and classified via bone cultures. These factors include insulin-like growth factors I and II, transforming growth factor-beta, fibroblast growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins. Evidence suggests that bone cells produce growth factors for extracellular storage in the <b>bone</b> <b>matrix.</b> The release of these growth factors from the <b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> could cause the proliferation of osteoblast precursors. Essentially, bone growth factors may act as potential determinants of local bone formation. Research has suggested that cancellous bone volume in postemenopausal osteoporosis may be determined by the relationship between the total bone forming surface and the percent of surface resorption.|$|E

Upon partial dephosphorylation, both osteopontin and bone sialoprotein are incapable of binding to osteoclasts.

40|$|Aluminum may be {{pathogenic}} in the osteomalacia {{observed in}} some patients receiving hemodialysis. To study the early effects of Al on bone growth, bone formation, mineralization, and resorption were measured during short-term Al exposure in the tibial cortex of pair-fed control (C, n = 10), aluminum-treated (AL, n = 9), subtotally nephrectomized control (NX-C, n = 7), and subtotally nephrectomized aluminum-treated (NX-AL, n = 8) rats using double tetracycline labeling of bone. Animals received 2 mg/d of elemental Al intraperitoneally for 5 d/wk over 4 wk. Total <b>bone</b> and <b>matrix</b> (osteoid) formation, periosteal <b>bone</b> and <b>matrix</b> formation, and periosteal <b>bone</b> and <b>matrix</b> apposition fell by 20 % in AL from C, P less than 0. 05 for all values, and by 40 % in NX-AL from NX-C, P less than 0. 01 for all values. Moreover, each measurement was significantly less in NX-AL than in AL, P less than 0. 05 for all values. Osteoid width did not increase following aluminum administration in either AL or NX-AL. Resorption surface increased from control values in both AL and NX-AL; also, resorptive activity at the endosteum was greater in NX-AL than in NX-C, P less than 0. 05. Thus, aluminum impairs new <b>bone</b> and <b>matrix</b> formation but does not cause classic osteomalacia in the cortical bone of rats whether renal function is normal or reduced. These findings may represent either a different response to aluminum administration in cortical bone as contrasted to trabecular bone or an early phase {{in the development of}} osteomalacia. Aluminum may increase bone resorption and contribute to osteopenia in clinical states associated with aluminum accumulation in bone...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{present report}} {{concerns}} an infantile patient with mucolipidosis II, who showed transient cortical bone hyperostosis followed by severe osteopenia. The diagnosis of mucolipidosis II was made {{based on the}} leakage of lysosomal enzymes in serum and conditioned media of the patient’s skin fibroblasts, low activity of lysosomal enzymes of the fibroblasts and mutation of c. 2086 _ 2089 insC (p.

Bone markers, including alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin and urine deoxypyridinoline, also indicated a high turnover of bone metabolism; however, no apparent rickets-like changes and no increased levels of PTH were observed. Elevated bone resorption is possibly associated with the leakage of lysosomal enzyme from osteoclasts into <b>bone</b> <b>matrices.</b> <b>Bone</b> formation gradually reduced, and increased bone resorption persisted.

25|$|The exact {{role that}} these risk factors {{play in the}} process leading to rupture is unclear. Aortic root {{dilatation}} {{is thought to be}} due to a mesenchymal defect as pathological evidence of cystic medial necrosis has been found by several studies. The association between a similar defect and aortic dilatation is well established in such conditions such as Marfan syndrome. Also, abnormalities in other mesenchymal tissues (<b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> and lymphatic vessels) suggests a similar primary mesenchymal defect in patients with Turner syndrome. However, no evidence suggests that patients with Turner syndrome have a significantly higher risk of aortic dilatation and dissection in absence of predisposing factors. So, the risk of aortic dissection in Turner syndrome appears to be a consequence of structural cardiovascular malformations and hemodynamic risk factors rather than a reflection of an inherent abnormality in connective tissue. The natural history of aortic root dilatation is unknown, but because of its lethal potential, this aortic abnormality needs to be carefully followed.|$|E
2500|$|Once activated, osteoclasts move {{to areas}} of microfracture {{in the bone}} by chemotaxis. Osteoclasts lie in a small cavity called Howship's lacunae, formed from the {{digestion}} of the underlying bone. The sealing zone is the attachment of the osteoclast's plasma membrane to the underlying bone. Sealing zones are bounded by belts of specialized adhesion structures called podosomes. Attachment to the <b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> is facilitated by integrin receptors, such as αvβ3, via the specific amino acid motif Arg-Gly-Asp in <b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> proteins, such as osteopontin. The osteoclast releases hydrogen ions through the action of carbonic anhydrase (H2O + CO2 → HCO3− + H+) through the ruffled border into the resorptive cavity, acidifying and aiding dissolution of the mineralized <b>bone</b> <b>matrix</b> into Ca2+, H3PO4, H2CO3, water and other substances. Dysfunction of the carbonic anhydrase has been documented to cause some forms of osteopetrosis. [...] Hydrogen ions are pumped against a high concentration gradient by proton pumps, specifically a unique vacuolar-ATPase. This enzyme has been targeted {{in the prevention of}} osteoporosis. In addition, several hydrolytic enzymes, such as members of the cathepsin and matrix metalloprotease (MMP) groups, are released to digest the organic components of the matrix. These enzymes are released into the compartment by lysosomes. Of these hydrolytic enzymes, cathepsin K is of most importance.|$|E

40|$|Ceresiosaurus is a {{secondarily}} marine reptile {{that lived}} during the Middle Triassic (Ladinian–Anisian) in a subtropical lagoonal environment with varying open marine influences. The genus comprises two species, Ceresiosaurus calcagnii and C. lanzi, and {{represents one of}} the largest vertebrate of up to 3 -m snout-tail length from the UNESCO World Heritage site Monte San Giorgio, which is settled along the Swiss–Italian border. Earlier morphological studies identified this genus as basal sauropterygian still possessing many similarities with the plesiomorphic ancestral terrestrial condition. Interspecific morphological variation was interpreted as indicator for different habit(at) preferences by ascribing two locomotion types for each of the species. In this study, detailed data on the microstructure of the long bones are given and findings were put into a palaeoecological and phylogenetic context in comparison to other sauropterygians from Monte San Giorgio. Results showed that both Ceresiosaurus species retain a calcified cartilaginous core in the medullary region in at least young individuals. They both exhibit cyclical bone growth of lamellar to parallel-fibred <b>bone</b> <b>matrices</b> with undulating incremental growth marks and low to moderate vascularisation (lamellar-zonal bone tissue type). Interspecific variation comprises differences in the distribution of differently organised <b>bone</b> <b>matrices</b> and the size, orientation and number of vascularisation.

The bone sample of C. lanzi is only osteosclerotic and most similar to young Nothosaurus (except for the irregular presence of fibrolamellar bone in the latter).
