60|$|The scheme {{accepted}} by the cabinet was in essentials Mr. Gladstone's own. Jowett at the earliest stage sent him a comprehensive plan, and soon after, saw Lord John (Jan. 6). 'I must own,' writes the latter to Gladstone, 'I was much struck by the clearness and completeness of his views.' The difference between Jowett's plan and Mr. Gladstone's was on the highly important point of machinery. Jowett, who all his life had a weakness for getting and keeping authority into his own hands, or {{the hands of those}} whom he could influence, contended that after parliament had settled principles, Oxford itself could be trusted to settle details far better than a little body of great personages from outside, unacquainted with special wants and special interests. Mr. Gladstone, on the other hand, invented the idea of an executive commission with statutory powers. The two plans were printed and circulated, and the balance of opinion in the cabinet went decisively for Mr. Gladstone's scheme. The discussion between him and Jowett, ranging over the whole field of the bill, was maintained until its actual production, in many interviews and much correspondence. In drawing the clauses Mr. Gladstone received the help of Bethell, the solicitor-general, at whose suggestion Phillimore and Thring were called in for further aid in what was undoubtedly a task of exceptional difficulty. The process brought into clearer light the truth discerned by Mr. Gladstone from the first, that the enormous number of diverse institutions that had grown up in Oxford made resort to what he called sub-legislation inevitable; that is to say, they were too complex for parliament, and could only be dealt with <b>by</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> executive act.|$|E

5000|$|Some protesters {{have argued}} that Federal Reserve notes (better known as dollar bills) are not {{actually}} money, because the Constitution only permits the government to [...] "coin" [...] money, and requires that such money be exchangeable for gold or silver; therefore, printed bills are instead symbols for use in bartering, and being paid in dollars is not the receipt of taxable income. This argument was brought before a court in Wilson v. United States. The court responded: The contention that paper money is illegal has been consistently rejected. … Congress has exercised this power <b>by</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> the federal reserve system. 12 U.S.C. section 411.

40|$|As markets evolve, new {{regulatory}} concerns emerge. In response, policymakers institute new {{requirements for}} private businesses. Because they impose costs and generate uncertainty, these requirements may deter firm investment. To reduce regulatory uncertainty and favor investment, a principal can choose a rule-based regulatory framework. However, unlike discretion, rules do not adapt to circumstances {{and are thus}} inefficient. Using a micro-founded model, we uncover circumstances under which the ex-ante cer-tainty provided by a rule dominates the ex-post efficiency provided <b>by</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> an unbiased agent.

40|$|The {{first two}} {{roles of the}} U. S. Attorney General from its {{inception}} were to represent {{the interests of the}} United States before the U. S. Supreme Court and to advise the President on matters of the law. Despite the Attorney General delegating both roles, the former to the Solicitor General and the latter to the Office of Legal Counsel (OLC), the Attorney General and the Department of Justice are by statute and tradition looked upon to be the protectors {{of the rule of law}} within the Executive Branch. It is to the Attorney General, and <b>by</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> the OLC, to say to the strong seas of presidential power, this far and no farther will you come and here your proud waves must stop! The role of the OLC to provide dispositive opinions on the meaning of the law and to protect the rule of law requires that the OLC provide a specific type of advice that separates it from other types of legal advice from other quarters within the Executive Branch.

40|$|Prisoners bring {{over twenty}} percent of the civil cases filed in federal {{district}} courts, predominantly seeking redress for violations of their civil rights, or release from prison under habeas corpus. Because most prisoners (around ninety-three percent) proceed pro se in their federal civil litigation, they are already at a disadvantage. The deck is stacked against prisoner plaintiffs in other systemic ways. Local rules, general orders, and even district courts’ job postings suggest that when a plaintiff is a pro se prisoner the plaintiff is denied an Article III judge. Judicial tasks that must be performed in prisoners’ cases, from administration to adjudication, are delegated to nonjudicial staff. As a result, in the very same federal courthouse, prisoners’ cases are decided by a court employee who works as part of the court’s “pro se staff,” while all other plaintiffs’ cases are decided by an Article III judge (or at least a magistrate judge, if they consent). The Supreme Court’s 2015 Wellness International Network v. Sharif decision drew attention to delegation of Article III claims to non-Article III judges in the bankruptcy realm. In that case, the Court rigorously considered the impact of the structural error caused <b>by</b> <b>delegation</b> <b>to</b> judges who do not enjoy fixed salaries or life tenure. But delegation of the judicial power in the prisoner litigation context is still hiding in plain sight. This Article is the first to investigate the scope of the delegation to pro se staff and to consider corresponding separation of powers concerns. Local procedure that delegates this deciding judicial power to pro se staff has gone too far. Local procedure crafts rules for prisoner litigation that conflict with federal law, effectively denying access to an Article III judge. When federal courts overreach in this manner, their rulemaking exceeds the limited rulemaking authority Congress has delegated to the judiciary. This local procedure also violates federal policy, which generally disfavors allowing nonjudicial actors to perform judicial tasks. This Article concludes with recommendations about how to solve the delegation problem. The strongest solution would be to eliminate the local procedures in question and the pro se staff they create. Congress would be required to address the issue directly and nationwide by creating, or not, additional procedure for prisoner litigation. A more moderate approach would publicize the identity of pro se staff as well as the nature of the work the staff undertakes and would allow for a review procedure similar to that afforded to litigants who proceed in front of magistrate judges. Either proposal would bring pro se staff out of the shadows of federal litigation...|$|E
