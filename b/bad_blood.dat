5000|$|De Haan's {{murder is}} {{considered}} the first political murder in the Jewish community in Palestine.

While his collection contained more than 13,000specimens, Cope's fossil hoard was still much smaller than Marsh's collection, valued at over a milliondollars. The University of Pennsylvania bought part of Cope's ethnological artifact collection for $5,500. The Academy of Natural Sciences, Philadelphia's foremost museum, did not bid on any of Cope's sales due to <b>bad</b> <b>blood</b> between Cope and the museum's leaders; as a result, many of Cope's major finds left the city. Cope's proceeds from the sales allowed him to rehire Sternberg to prospect for fossils on his behalf.|$|E

50|$|Because {{of these}} attempts, {{and for other}} reasons, a second more radical step {{was added to the}} {{circumcision}} procedure. This was added around 140 CE, and was named Brit Peri'ah. In this step, the foreskin was cut further back, to the ridge behind the glans penis, called the coronal sulcus. The inner mucosal tissue was removed by use of a sharp finger nail or implement, including the excising and removal of the frenulum from the underside of the glans. Later during the Talmudic period (500-625 CE) a third step, known as Metzitzah, began to be practiced. In this step the mohel would suck the blood from the circumcision wound with his mouth to remove what was believed to be <b>bad</b> excess <b>blood.</b> As it actually increases the likelihood of infections such as tuberculosis and venereal diseases, modern day mohels use a glass tube placed over the infant's penis for suction of the blood. In many Jewish ritual circumcisions this step of Metzitzah has been eliminated.|$|R
