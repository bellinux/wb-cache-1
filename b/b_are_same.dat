Here B stands for any L p space or any Banach space isomorphic to a Hilbert space. We also verify that the comparison map Ψ 2 : H 2 b(G, B) → H 2 (G, B) from bounded to usual cohomology is injective, where G and <b>B</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> as in above. For our proof, we establish a certain implication from Kazhdan’s property (T) to a fixed point property on uniformly convex Banach spaces. 1. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{process of}} making a cake in the modern era, {{demanding}} speed {{because of the time}} more valuable and more widely distribution coverage, which means greater production capacity. Then the process is made as efficient as possible. Busyness is high enough to make parents and family also eventually follow the diet and no hassle instant preparation. Now was enough just to buy one box of instant cake mix that is usually already included in the package, plus live eggs, and butter cake be desired. The process is also very clear instructions printed on the packaging of instant flour. From the results of analysis of Material Differences between Normal and Instant Ingredients (Paired Samples Correlations) then we can see the differences, views of significant value. If sig is smaller than 0 : 05, the materials A and B materials are different, but if the sig is greater than 0 : 05, the materials A and B, have same material. From the above table can be viewed texture and flavor of the cake A and B are different, while for the smell, taste, and colors have in common. So it can be concluded that between the two cakes A and <b>B</b> <b>are</b> <b>same.</b>   </div...|$|E
40|$|Crowdsourcing is {{becoming}} increasingly important in entity resolution tasks due to their inherent complexity such as clustering of images and natural language processing. Humans can provide more insightful information for these difficult problems compared to machine-based automatic techniques. Nevertheless, human workers can make mistakes {{due to lack of}} domain expertise or seriousness, ambiguity, or even due to malicious intents. The state-of-the-art literature usually deals with human errors via majority voting or by assigning a universal error rate over crowd workers. However, such approaches are incomplete, and often inconsistent, because the expertise of crowd workers are diverse with possible biases, thereby making it largely inappropriate to assume a universal error rate for all workers over all crowdsourcing tasks. To this end, we mitigate the above challenges by considering an uncertain graph model, where the edge probability between two records A and B denotes the ratio of crowd workers who voted Yes on the question if A and <b>B</b> <b>are</b> <b>same</b> entity. In order to reflect independence across different crowdsourcing tasks, we apply the well-established notion of possible worlds, and develop parameter-free algorithms both for next crowdsourcing, as well as for entity resolution problems. In particular, using our framework, the problem of entity resolution becomes equivalent to finding the maximum-likelihood clustering; whereas for the next crowdsourcing, we identify the record pair that maximally increases the reliability of the maximum-likelihood clustering. Based on detailed empirical analysis over real-world datasets, we find that our proposed solution, PERC (probabilistic entity resolution with imperfect crowd) improves the quality by 15 % and reduces the overall cost by 50 % for the crowdsourcing-based entity resolution problem.
