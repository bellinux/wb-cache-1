500|$|Hitler's father Alois Hitler Sr. (1837–1903) was the {{illegitimate child}} of Maria Anna Schicklgruber. The <b>baptismal</b> <b>register</b> {{did not show}} {{the name of his}} father, and Alois {{initially}} bore his mother's surname Schicklgruber. In 1842, Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois's mother Maria Anna. Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler's brother, Johann Nepomuk Hiedler. In 1876, Alois was legitimated and the <b>baptismal</b> <b>register</b> changed by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois's father (recorded as [...] "Georg Hitler"). Alois then assumed the surname [...] "Hitler", also spelled Hiedler, Hüttler, or Huettler. The Hitler surname is probably based on [...] "one who lives in a hut" [...] (German Hütte for [...] "hut").|$|E
500|$|Verdi, {{the first}} child of Carlo Giuseppe Verdi (1785–1867) and Luigia Uttini (1787–1851), was born at their home in Le Roncole, a village near Busseto, then in the Département Taro and within the borders of [...] the First French Empire {{following}} the annexation of the Duchy of Parma and Piacenza in 1808. The <b>baptismal</b> <b>register,</b> prepared on 11 October 1813, lists his parents Carlo and Luigia as [...] "innkeeper" [...] and [...] "spinner" [...] respectively. [...] Additionally, it lists Verdi as being [...] "born yesterday", but since days were often considered to begin at sunset, this could have meant either 9 or 10 October. Verdi himself, following his mother, always celebrated his birthday on 9 October.|$|E

2500|$|Broschi {{was born}} in Andria (in what is now Apulia, Italy) into a family of musicians. As {{recorded}} in the <b>baptismal</b> <b>register</b> {{of the church of}} S. Nicola in Andria, his father Salvatore was a composer and maestro di cappella of the city's cathedral, and his mother, Caterina Barrese, a citizen of Naples. The Duke of Andria, Fabrizio Carafa, a member of the House of Carafa, one of the most prestigious families of the Neapolitan nobility, honored Maestro Broschi by taking a leading part in the baptism of his second son, who was baptised Carlo Maria Michelangelo Nicola[...] In 1706 Salvatore also took up the non-musical post of governor of the town of Maratea (on the western coast of what is now Basilicata), and in 1709 that of Terlizzi (some twenty miles south-east of Andria). Unlike many castrati, who came from poor families, Farinelli was well-to-do, and was related to minor nobility {{on both sides of the}} family.|$|E
50|$|Niemöller, Rabenau and Kurt Scharf (Congregation in Sachsenhausen (Oranienburg)) {{circulated}} an appeal, {{calling the}} pastors up not {{to fill in}} the forms, meant to prove their Aryan descent, distributed by the Evangelical Supreme Church Council. Thus its president Werner furloughed the three on 9 November. For more and more purposes Germans had to prove their so-called Aryan descent, which usually was confirmed by copies from the <b>baptismal</b> <b>registers</b> of the churches, certifying that all four grandparents had been baptised. Some pastors soon understood, that people lacking four baptised grandparents are helped a lot - and later even rescued their lives - if they were certified to be Aryan by false copies from the <b>baptismal</b> <b>registers.</b> Pastor Paul Braune (Lobetal, a part of today's Bernau bei Berlin) issued a memorandum, secretly handed out to pastors of confidence, how to falsify the best. But the majority of pastors in their legalist attitude would not issue false copies.|$|R

60|$|His <b>baptismal</b> <b>register</b> {{spoke of}} him pessimistically as John Henry, {{but he had}} left that behind with the other {{maladies}} of infancy, and his friends knew him under the front-name of Adrian. His mother lived in Bethnal Green, which was not altogether his fault; one can discourage too much history in one's family, but one cannot always prevent geography. And, after all, the Bethnal Green habit has this virtue--that it is seldom transmitted to the next generation. Adrian lived in a roomlet which came under the auspicious constellation of W.|$|E
60|$|We have, however, {{no record}} of Cartier and his actual doings until we find his name in an entry on the <b>baptismal</b> <b>register</b> of St Malo. He stood as godfather to his nephew, Etienne Nouel, the son of his sister Jehanne. Strangely enough, this proved to be only {{the first of a}} great many sacred ceremonies of this sort in which he took part. There is a record of more than fifty baptisms at St Malo in the next forty-five years in which the illustrious mariner had some share; in twenty-seven of them he {{appeared}} as a godfather.|$|E
60|$|It was {{a prosperous}} winter; Felix, as partner and {{acknowledged}} editor, {{was in a}} more comfortable position both as to income and authority. Other matters were going well. Fulbert, to the general surprise, turned out a capital letter-writer, and sent home excellent accounts of himself, working heartily in a situation in the post- office, which Mr. Audley's Somerville interest had managed to secure for him. Moreover, all close scholarships had not been abolished, and Felix's opportunities in the newspaper line had enabled him to discover one at St. Cadoc's, a small college at Cambridge, to be competed for by the natives of the county where Clement had fortunately been born. A letter to the parish clerk of Vale Leston, {{to ask for the}} <b>baptismal</b> <b>register</b> of Edward Clement Underwood, produced a reply from a well-remembered old Abednego Tripp, who declared himself 'horned and rejoiced' at hearing from Master Felix, and at being able to do anything for one of the Reverend Mr. Edward's sons. The competition was not very severe; Clement obtained the scholarship, and therewith his maintenance for three years to come; and he was at the same time able to exercise a bit of patronage on his sisters' behalf, more gratifying to his own feelings than theirs. Mr. Fulmort's unmarried sisters had lived in the country with a former governess, until on the death of the elder, the survivor decided on employing her very considerable fortune in establishing a school where girls of small means might be prepared for becoming first-rate governesses, with special openings for the daughters of poor clergy and of missionaries.|$|E

60|$|What voyages Cartier {{actually}} made before he suddenly appears {{in history as}} a pilot of the king of France and the protege of the high admiral of France we do not know. This position in itself, {{and the fact that}} at the time of his marriage in 1519 he had already the rank of master-pilot, would show that he had made the Atlantic voyage. There is some faint evidence that he had even been to Brazil, for in the account of his first recorded voyage he makes a comparison between the maize of Canada and that of South America; and in those days this would scarcely have occurred to a writer who had not seen both plants of which he spoke. 'There groweth likewise,' so runs the quaint translation that appears in Hakluyt's 'Voyages,' 'a kind of Millet as big as peason [i.e. peas] like unto that which groweth in Bresil.' And later on, in the account of his second voyage, he repeats the reference to Brazil; then 'goodly and large fields' which he saw on the present site of Montreal recall to him the millet fields of Brazil. It is possible, indeed, that not only had he been in Brazil, but that he had carried a native of that country to France. In a <b>baptismal</b> <b>register</b> of St Malo is recorded the christening, in 1528, of a certain 'Catherine of Brezil,' to whom Cartier's wife stood godmother. We may, in fancy at least, suppose that this forlorn little savage with the regal title was a little girl whom the navigator, after the fashion of his day, had brought home as living evidence of the existence of the strange lands that he had seen.|$|E
6000|$|Near {{the church}} of this village there was a well, celebrated among the {{peasantry}} of the district for one remarkable property--every child baptized in its water (with which the church was duly supplied on christening occasions) was secure from ever being hanged. No one doubted that all the babies fortunate enough to be born and baptized in the parish, though they might live {{to the age of}} Methuselah, and might during that period commit all the capital crimes recorded in the [...] "Newgate Calendar," [...] were still destined to keep quite clear of the summary jurisdiction of Jack Ketch--no one doubted this, until the story of the apparition of the murderess began to be spread abroad. Then, awful misgivings arose in the popular mind. A woman who had been born close by the magical well, and who had therefore in all probability been baptized in its water like her neighbours of the parish, had nevertheless been publicly and unquestionably hanged. However, probability was not always truth--everybody determined that the <b>baptismal</b> <b>register</b> of the poisoner should be sought for, and that it should be thus officially ascertained whether she had been christened with the well water, or not. After much trouble, the important document was discovered--not where it was first looked after, but in a neighbouring parish vestry. A mistake had been made about the woman's birthplace--she had not been baptized in the local church, and had therefore not been protected by the marvellous virtue of the local water. Unutterable was the joy and triumph of this discovery throughout the village--the wonderful character of the parish well was wonderfully vindicated--its celebrity immediately spread wider than ever. The peasantry of the neighbouring districts began to send for the renowned water before christenings; and many of them actually continue, to this day, to bring it corked up in bottles to their churches, and to beg particularly that it may be used whenever they present their children to be baptized.|$|E

He copied almost every 19th century baptismal, marriage and death record he could locate at Rosario Cathedral and Milagres Church, cataloguing them according to surnames. Lobo initially experienced difficulties in the project since only the <b>baptismal</b> <b>registers</b> were maintained in reasonably good condition, while large sections of the marriage and death registers were missing, {{and it was not}} feasible to build the genealogy of any family on the basis of baptismal records alone.|$|R

His name also appears in the <b>baptismal</b> <b>registers</b> of parishes in Sherrill and New Vienna, both of which are near Dubuque. At times, some of these parishes would have their own priest who would stay {{for a while and then}} leave, and Alleman would have to take over administration of the parish again.

40|$|Mission records, however, contain rich {{demographic}} and social data essential {{for understanding the}} dynamics of culture contact at the regional level (Aschmann 1986 : 243 - 244). Analysis of regional dynamics is essential because—to cite one reason—mission documents cannot be used to estimate native population without assessing the extent of conversion. Simply, if large numbers of native peoples remained outside the mission system, then the mission records incompletely reflect the total population.
