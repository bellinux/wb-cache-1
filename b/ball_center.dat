50|$|To {{stabilize}} {{its height}} further, the tower will also feature a {{tuned mass damper}} on the 77th floor. The force of wind against tall buildings can cause the top of skyscrapers to move more than a meter. This motion {{can be in the}} form of swaying or twisting, and can cause the upper floors of such buildings to move more than is usually desired by high-rise occupants. Due to the square shape of 1200 S Indiana, wind will hit the facade more abruptly. A mass damper system will counteract this swaying by placing a large mass (in this case, a metal and concrete <b>ball)</b> <b>center</b> upon several pneumatic and hydraulic pistons that move the mass in the opposite direction of the building's swaying motion. As wind shifts the building a few inches to the left, for example, pistons move the mass a few inches to the right to counteract the swaying and re-center the tower.|$|E

50|$|Early in {{the second}} quarter, Steelers {{receiver}} Andre Hastings returned a punt 12 yards to the Bills 43-yard line, setting up Norm Johnson's 45-yard field goal. Now facing a 17-0 deficit, the Bills offense self-destructed on their next drive. Facing 3rd and 8, Jim Kelly was sacked by linebacker Kevin Green and fumbled the <b>ball.</b> <b>Center</b> Kent Hull recovered the fumble for Buffalo, but it didn't help much. On the next play, Lee Flowers stormed into the backfield and tackled punter Chris Mohr on the Bills 12-yard line, leading to another Johnson field goal that gave Pittsburgh a 20-0 lead. Buffalo responded with a drive to the Steelers 30-yard line, only to lose the ball when Lake forced a fumble from Thurman Thomas that was recovered by defensive back Chris Oldham. However, the Bills soon got the ball back with excellent field position after Rohn Stark punted the ball 33 yards to the Steelers 49. Kelley then got the team to the 1-yard line with three completions, hitting Tony Cline for 17 yards, Andre Reed for 5, and Steve Tasker for 26. Thomas then ran {{the ball into the}} end zone, cutting the score to 20-7. Only 45 seconds remained in the half, but O'Donnell proved up to the challenge of earning his team some more points, completing 4 consecutive passes for 53 yards to get the team to the Bills 16-yard line. Johnson finished the drive with his third field goal, giving the Steelers a 23-7 halftime lead.|$|E
