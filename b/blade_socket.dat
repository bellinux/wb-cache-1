50|$|Shoulder {{arthritis}} is {{a clinical}} {{condition in which}} the joint that connects the ball of the arm bone (humeral head) to the shoulder <b>blade</b> <b>socket</b> (glenoid) has damaged or worn out cartilage. Normally {{the ends of the}} bone are covered with hyaline articular cartilage, a surface so smooth that the friction at the joint is less than that of an ice skate on ice. In arthritis, this cartilage is progressively lost, exposing the bone beneath. Shoulder arthritis is characterized by pain, stiffness, and loss of function and often by a grinding on shoulder motion.|$|E
5000|$|Cheater plugs were {{previously}} available {{with a short}} flexible grounding wire rather than a screw tab. This allows use of the second duplex outlet {{that does not have}} a faceplate screw in the correct location for the screw tab. The grounding wire would be wrapped around the adapter to reach the faceplate screw. However, this ground-wire style of cheater plug was discontinued when it was noted that a loose unattached grounding wire could by accident become inserted into the [...] "hot" [...] <b>blade</b> <b>socket</b> of a nearby outlet, potentially leading to electrocution.|$|E
25|$|The offset may be {{implemented}} by curving the forks, adding a perpendicular tab at their lower ends, offseting the fork <b>blade</b> <b>sockets</b> of the fork crown {{ahead of the}} steerer, or by mounting the forks into the crown {{at an angle to}} the steer tube. The development of forks with curves is attributed to George Singer.|$|R
25|$|The adze is {{depicted}} in ancient Egyptian art from the Old Kingdom onward. Originally the adze blades were made of stone, but already in the Predynastic Period copper adzes had all but replaced those made of flint. While stone blades were fastened to the wooden handle by tying, metal <b>blades</b> had <b>sockets</b> into which the handle was fitted. Examples of Egyptian adzes {{can be found in}} museums and on the Petrie Museum website.|$|R

5000|$|The {{electric}} foil contains a socket underneath the guard that {{connects to the}} scoring apparatus via the body cord and a wire that runs down a channel cut {{into the top of}} the <b>blade.</b> Electric foil <b>sockets</b> are fixed so that the body cord plugs into the weapon at the fencer's wrist. There are two main varieties of socket in use today: the two-prong variety which has unequal diameter prongs and is held in place by a retaining clip, and the single-prong [...] "bayonette" [...] which twist-locks into place.|$|R
25|$|Consolidation of {{standards}} eases {{international trade and}} travel. For example, the CEE7/7 plug has been adopted in several European countries and is compatible with both CEE7/3 and CEE7/5 sockets, while the unearthed and unpolarised CEE 7/16 Europlug is compatible with even more European and other socket types. IEC 60906-1 has been proposed as a common standard for all 230 V plugs and sockets worldwide but has been adopted only in South Africa so far, with a modified version used in Brazil. IEC 60906-2 recognizes the wide use of the NEMA 5-15 parallel <b>blade</b> plug and <b>socket</b> and recommends it for all 120 V applications.|$|R
60|$|Before I could recover {{myself the}} door was burst open, and I was dragged by the heels on to the road. But even as I was torn out on to the flint stones, and {{realized}} that thirty ruffians were standing around me, I was filled with joy, for my pelisse had been pulled over {{my head in the}} struggle and was covering one of my eyes, and it was with my wounded eye that I was seeing this gang of brigands. You see for yourself by this pucker and scar how the thin <b>blade</b> passed between <b>socket</b> and ball, but it was only at that moment, when I was dragged from the coach, that I understood that my sight was not gone for ever. The creature's intention, doubtless, was to drive it through into my brain, and indeed he loosened some portion of the inner bone of my head, so that I afterwards had more trouble from that wound than from any one of the seventeen which I have received.|$|R

5000|$|... "A pole-axe {{longer in}} shaft (than the earlier broad-headed axe) {{and having the}} narrow lower end of tall blade rounded inward and braced against the shaft. At first this {{lower end of the}} blade merely touched the wooden shaft; it then became {{fastened}} to it; next it embraced the shaft, developing for this purpose an encircling loop, like the main ring which forms the socket of the axe-head. This “generalized” type of pole-axe was common to all countries of Europe before the year 1400. It was essentially the butcher's heavy weapon with which he clave the head of an ox. It was this primitive halberd which the Swiss mountaineers used in their early struggle with Austria, and at Sempach and Mortgarten it destroy much splendid armor. But, in battle it was found useful not only for chopping but for thrusting, hence the narrowing of the front end of it's plate."The blade varied greatly in shape, but was most often a long, cleaver type blade. The distinction was in how the blade was attached to the pole. The bardiche blade was attached to the pole either via two sockets (one {{at the top of the}} pole and one lower, at the base of the <b>blade)</b> or one <b>socket</b> at the top and one surface mount at the base, effectively mounting the heavy blade to the wooden shaft. This construction is also seen in Scottish polearms, such as the Lochaber axe and Jeddart staff, and bardiches are known to have been imported into Scotland in the 16th and 17th centuries Depending on the design of the particular weapons in question, at times a bardiche may greatly resemble a voulge.|$|R
5000|$|During the 1850s, in a {{technological}} revolution of major proportions, the rifle musket began {{to replace the}} relatively inaccurate smoothbore musket in ever-increasing numbers, both in Europe and America. This process, accelerated by the Civil War, ensured that the rifled shoulder weapon would be the basic weapon used by infantrymen in both the Federal and Confederate armies.The standard and most common shoulder weapon used in the American Civil War was the Springfield [...]58‑caliber rifle musket, models 1855, 1861, and 1863. In 1855, the US Army adopted this weapon to replace the.69‑caliber smoothbore musket and the [...]54‑caliber rifle. In appearance, the rifle musket {{was similar to the}} smoothbore musket. Both were single‑shot muzzleloaders, but the rifled bore of the new weapon substantially increased its range and accuracy. The rifling system chosen by the United States was designed by Claude Minié, a French Army officer. Whereas earlier rifles fired a round nonexpanding ball, the Minié system used a hollow‑based cylindro‑conoidal projectile slightly smaller than the bore that dropped easily into the barrel. When the powder charge was ignited by a fulminate of mercury percussion cap, the released powder gases expanded the base of the bullet into the rifled grooves, giving the projectile a ballistic spin.The model 1855 Springfield rifle musket was the first regulation arm to use the hollow‑base [...]58‑caliber minie bullet. The slightly modified model 1861 was the principal infantry weapon of the Civil War, although two subsequent models in 1863 were produced in about equal quantities. The model 1861 was 56 inches long overall, had a 40‑inch barrel, and weighed 9 pounds 2 ounces with its bayonet. The 21-inch socket bayonet consisted of an 18‑inch triangular <b>blade</b> and 3‑inch <b>socket.</b> The Springfield had a rear sight graduated to 500 yards. The maximum effective range of this weapon was approximately 500 yards, although it had killing power at 1,000 yards. The round could penetrate 11 inches of white-pine board at 200 yards and 3¼ inches at 1,000 yards, with a penetration of 1 inch considered the equivalent of disabling a human being. Although the new weapons had increased accuracy and effectiveness, the soldiers’ vision was still obscured by the clouds of smoke produced by the rifle musket’s black powder propellant.|$|R
6000|$|Upon {{the end of}} the [...] "shank" [...] {{fits the}} head of the harpoon, known by the names swordfish-iron, lily-iron, and Indian dart. The form of this weapon has {{undergone}} much variation. The fundamental idea may very possibly have been derived from the Indian fish-dart, numerous specimens of which are in the National Museum, from various tribes of Indians of New England, British America, and the Pacific. However various the modifications may have been, the similarity of the different shapes is no less noteworthy from the fact that all are peculiarly American. In the enormous collection of fishery implements of all lands at the late exhibition at Berlin, nothing of the kind could be found. What is known to whalers as a toggle-harpoon is a modification of the lily-iron, but so greatly changed by the addition of a pivot by which the head of the harpoon is fastened to the shank that it can hardly be regarded as the same weapon. The lily-iron is, in principle, exactly what a whaleman would describe by the word [...] "toggle." [...] It consists of a two-pointed piece of metal, having in the center, at one side, a ring or socket the axis of which is parallel with the long diameter of the implement. In this is inserted {{the end of the}} pole-shank, and to it or near it is also attached the harpoon-line. When the iron has once been thrust point first through some solid substance, such as the side of a fish, and is released upon the other side by the withdrawal of the pole from the socket, it is free, and at once turns its long axis at right angle to the direction in which the harpoon-line is pulling, and this is absolutely prevented from withdrawal. The principle of the whale harpoon or toggle-iron is similar, except that the pole is not withdrawn, and the head, turning upon a pivot at its end, fastens the pole itself securely to the fish, the harpoon-line being attached to some part of the pole. The swordfish lily-iron head, as now ordinarily used, is about four inches in length, and consists of two lanceolate blades, each about {{an inch and a half}} long, connected by a central piece much thicker than they, in which, upon one side, and next to the flat side of the <b>blade,</b> is the <b>socket</b> for the insertion of the pole-shank. In this same central enlargement is forged an opening to which the harpoon-line is attached. The dart-head is usually made of steel; sometimes of iron, which is generally galvanized; sometimes of brass.|$|R
