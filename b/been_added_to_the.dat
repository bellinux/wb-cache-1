5|$|A water-powered mill in {{the castle}} grounds was {{probably}} built under Henry de Beaumont, 1stEarl of Warwick. By 1398 the mill had been relocated to just outside the eastern castle walls, {{on the west bank}} of the River Avon. Both mills were subject to flooding. By 1644, an engine house had <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> mill. The mill was reused as an electricity generating plant after it had stopped being used to grind, but once Warwick Castle was fitted with mains electricity in 1940, the mill was no longer required and was dismantled in 1954.

5|$|Barthel {{referred}} {{to each of}} 24 texts he accepted as genuine with a letter of the alphabet; two texts have <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> corpus since then. The two faces of the tablets are distinguished by suffixing r (recto) or v (verso) when the reading sequence can be ascertained, to which the line being discussed is appended. Thus Pr2 is item P (the Great Saint Petersburg Tablet), recto, second line. When the reading sequence cannot be ascertained, a and b are used for the faces. Thus Ab1 is item A (Tahua), side b, first line. The six sides of the Snuff Box are lettered as sides a to f. Nearly all publications follow the Barthel convention, though a popular book by Fischer uses an idiosyncratic numbering system.|$|E
5|$|By 1936, several U.S. {{highways}} had <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{system that}} took over parts of State Highway 8's route. US-62, added in 1930, {{took over the}} Lawton–Anadarko portion of the road. US-277 took {{over much of the}} remaining route between Randlett and Lawton. In addition, a US-70N had been created that overlaid US-277 between Randlett and the split with SH-5 west of Walters. These changes to the U.S. route system precipitated the truncation of SH-8 in 1936. On 1936-03-13, the section of the route between Anadarko and the state line was dropped. However, a new road between Anadarko and Cyril had been built; this became part of SH-8 and set the highway's southern terminus at its present location.|$|E
5|$|During a {{national}} recession from 2001 to 2003, the city lost 28,000 jobs. In response, a development initiative, Vision 2025, promised to incite {{economic growth and}} recreate lost jobs. Projects spurred by the initiative promised urban revitalization, infrastructure improvement, tourism development, riverfront retail development, and further diversification of the economy. As of 2007, employment levels have surpassed pre-recession heights and the city is in a significant economic development and investment surge. This economic improvement is also seen in Tulsa's housing trends which show an average of a 6% increase in rent in 2010. Since 2006, more than 28,000 jobs have <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> city. The unemployment rate of Tulsa in August 2014 was 4.5%.|$|E

Ferris offers to take the blame, but Cameron asserts he will stand up against his father.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, {{the arsenal}} was renamed Little Rock Barracks {{and the main}} {{building}} used as married officers' quarters. The building was drastically altered the inside and outside.

In 1880, Douglas MacArthur was born on the northwest upper floor of this building while his father, U.S. Army Captain Arthur MacArthur, was stationed there.|$|E
5|$|Richard Ferguson QC, for the defence, {{argued that}} the ESDA test, which {{suggested}} that the disputed words had <b>been</b> <b>added</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> notes later, was not reliable.
