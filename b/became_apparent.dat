5|$|Immediately after Perón's death, the {{government}} suspended all official activities {{for two days}} and ordered all flags flown at half-staff for ten days. It soon <b>became</b> <b>apparent,</b> however, that these measures fell short of reflecting popular grief.

5|$|There was {{danger of}} {{invasion}} {{from the more}} powerful French forces, so Adams and the Federalist congress built up the army, bringing back Washington as its commander. Washington wanted Hamilton to be his second-in-command and Adams reluctantly accommodated. It <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that Hamilton was truly in charge due to Washington's advanced years.|$|E

5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of electron configurations within atoms, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.

5|$|After the war, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> {{that most}} holiday camps in Britain had {{been damaged by}} troop occupation, and the {{situation}} {{was so bad that}} questions were raised in parliament. Other than Clacton, the Butlins camps were relatively unscathed, and even Clacton, which had been damaged by troop occupation, re-opened in early 1946. In the post-war boom Butlin saw opportunities on foreign shores. He opened camps at Mosney, in the soon to be Republic of Ireland, in 1948 and on Grand Bahama, in 1949.|$|E

Her first collection of poetry was published in 1890 by personal acquaintances Thomas Wentworth Higginson and Mabel Loomis Todd, though both heavily edited the content. A complete, and mostly unaltered, collection of her poetry became available for the first time when scholar Thomas H. Johnson published The Poems of Emily Dickinson in 1955.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} theoretical {{decision for}} White {{is to choose}} whether to play a2–a3. While this move protects the b4 square and threatens the pawn advance b2–b4, it encourages Black's rook lift Ra8–a6–h6. As Lalic puts it:It was {{not so long ago}} that 8.a3, with the obvious intention of expanding with b2–b4, was the standard move. However, after Black responds with the logical a7–a5, it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> in tournament practice that the inclusion of these moves is in fact in Black's favour, as it gives his queen's rook access into play via the a6-square.|$|E

Samuelsson notched six points in ten post-season games.|$|E
5|$|As it <b>became</b> <b>apparent</b> that, {{not only}} were {{conditions}} in the ghettos terrible (hunger, diseases, etc.), but that the Jews were being singled out for extermination at Nazi concentration camps, they increasingly tried to escape and hide {{in order to survive}} the war.

Many of these efforts arose spontaneously from individual initiatives, but there were also organized networks dedicated to aiding the Jews.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of his National Letter of Intent signing with Michigan Wolverines basketball, ESPN.com and Scout.com ranked McGary as the number two player in the United States high school class of 2012, while Rivals.com ranked him as the number three prospect.

5|$|By 1970 these {{differences}} {{had not been}} resolved, and Brezhnev postponed the 24th Party Congress and the Ninth Five-Year Plan (1971–1975).
