40|$|Table 1 {{illustrates}} {{the impact of}} different <b>distribution</b> <b>unit</b> sizes, different screen resolutions, and numbers of GPU nodes. We use two and four GPUs (NVIDIA Quadro 5000 with 2. 5 GB memory) and a mouse cortex EM dataset (see Figure 2) of resolution 21, 494 x 25, 790 x 1, 850 = 955 GB. The size of the virtual <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> significantly influences the data distribution between nodes. Small <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> result in a high depth complexity for compositing. Large <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> lead to a low utilization of GPUs, because in the worst case only a single <b>distribution</b> <b>unit</b> will be in view, which is rendered by only a single node. The choice of an optimal <b>distribution</b> <b>unit</b> size depends on three major factors: the output screen resolution, the block cache size on each node, {{and the number of}} nodes. Currently, we are working on optimizing the compositing step and network communication between nodes. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a deterministic approach for performance assessment and optimization of power <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> in Iran. The deterministic approach {{is composed of}} data envelopment analysis (DEA), principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation techniques. Seventeen electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>units</b> have been considered {{for the purpose of}} this study. Previous studies have generally used input-output DEA models for benchmarking and evaluation of electricity <b>distribution</b> <b>units.</b> However, this study considers an integrated deterministic DEA-PCA approach since the DEA model should be verified and validated by a robust multivariate methodology such as PCA. Moreover, the DEA models are verified and validated by PCA, Spearman and Kendall's Tau correlation techniques, while previous studies do not have the verification and validation features. Also, both input- and output-oriented DEA models are used for sensitivity analysis of the input and output variables. Finally, this is the first study to present an integrated deterministic approach for assessment and optimization of power distributions in Iran.
