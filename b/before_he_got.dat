5|$|Brian and Stewie go to {{the mall}} so they can meet Santa, but Peter is asking Santa for gifts (he asks for a game of Uno, a Magna Doodle, a pet chink (a mix of a {{chinchilla}} and a mink) and a Charles in Charge lunchbox.) When the mall Santa leaves for the night and Brian demands that he let Stewie sit in his lap, Santa mentions he will be at Applebee's. Stewie says that Santa leaving <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> a chance to sit in his lap felt like a bigger betrayal than the betrayal of Gary Busey by reality; this takes us to Busey looking himself in the mirror asking his reflection, {{in the form of a}} crazed clown, how he is doing.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool's {{pressure}} {{paid off}} in the 68th minute as McManaman scored a second goal. From {{the left side of}} the pitch, McManaman went past Green, then McAteer, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> in front of Seagraves and scored with a shot into the Bolton goal. Bolton replied immediately. Liverpool defender Neil Ruddock's clearance was played back into the Liverpool penalty area by Guðni Bergsson who had replaced Green. Paatelainen headed the ball onto Thompson, whose shot went into the Liverpool goal. Bolton continued to pressure Liverpool in search of the equaliser but were unable to score and Liverpool won the match 2–1 to claim their fifth League Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|More widely, 1936 {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of the Great Terror, in which many of the composer's friends and relatives were imprisoned or killed. These included his patron Marshal Tukhachevsky (shot months after his arrest); his brother-in-law Vsevolod Frederiks (a distinguished physicist, who was eventually released but died <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> home); his close friend Nikolai Zhilyayev (a musicologist who had taught Tukhachevsky; shot shortly after his arrest); his mother-in-law, the astronomer Sofiya Mikhaylovna Varzar (sent to a camp in Karaganda); his friend the Marxist writer Galina Serebryakova (20 years in camps); his uncle Maxim Kostrykin (died); and his colleagues Boris Kornilov and Adrian Piotrovsky (executed). His only consolation in this period was the birth of his daughter Galina in 1936; his son Maxim was born two years later.|$|E

25|$|When he woke up, Xwechtáal {{followed}} the instructions {{and made the}} spears and the raft. He moved the raft out onto the lake and paddled across with his spears. Grabbing two spears, he attacked the daytime head. As the head began to die and fall, the opposite head woke from its slumber, angry and distressed. Quickly paddling across to the other head, he speared this head with one spear. Then the serpent dove underwater towards a tunnel deep in the lake to escape, but Xwechtáal took the last spear and nailed the serpent head <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> away.|$|E

25|$|Linklater {{assembled}} the cast {{for two weeks}} of rehearsals in Austin, Texas before principal photography began in order to fine-tune the script. The result was a fusion of Linklater's writing, the novel and the actors' input. To prepare for their respective roles, Cochrane came up with his character five minutes <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> on the elevator to work; Downey Jr. memorized his dialogue by writing it all out in run-on sentences, studying them and then converting them to acronyms; and Reeves relied on the book, marking down each scene in the screenplay to the corresponding page.|$|E
25|$|In {{his first}} year at AaB, Andersen spent his time in the reserve team {{improving}} his technique, <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> his national breakthrough when he scored two goals in a Danish Cup game against BK Frem in March 1993. He soon displayed his goal scoring abilities, which earned him the nickname Red Romario, alluding to Brazilian striker Romario and Andersen's red hair. In the 1994–95 Superliga season, Andersen scored two hat-tricks, and even scored four goals in a 5–0 win against AGF Aarhus. He was league topscorer with 24 goals as AaB won the 1994–95 Superliga championship, the first championship in club history. He played {{the first half of the}} 1995–96 Superliga season, scoring 13 goals in 20 games, including another two hat-tricks. In February 1996, Andersen was bought in a transfer deal worth £ 1,2 million by Rangers in the Scottish Premier Division.|$|E
25|$|Since 206 BC, when Scipio Africanus finally {{expelled}} the Carthaginians from Iberia (see {{the battle}} of Ilipa), he was preoccupied {{with the idea that}} Africa should be the next target. To this end he concluded an alliance with Syphax – {{one of the most powerful}} Numidian rulers at the time and an old foe of Carthage – even <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> authority from Rome to lead the future invasion. Even though Scipio was elected consul for 205 BC, he had to endure hard political wrangling before the Senate approved his intentions. His main opponent was Quintus Fabius Maximus Cunctator (the Delayer), who argued that the expedition to Africa was too risky and that the primary objective was to fight Hannibal in Bruttium. Scipio managed to persuade the senators that his plan was the perfect way to force the Carthaginians out of Italy. Nevertheless, he was not given enough resources and had to spend a whole year in preparations.|$|E

500|$|On July 7, 2012, {{there was}} a vigil {{organized}} in Lamb of God's hometown of Richmond, Virginia, by a friend of Blythe's.

But he just rose a little bit, his altitude, leveled off, and he was headed straight for the Trade Center. So just <b>before</b> <b>he</b> <b>got</b> to the Trade Center, it seemed as though he gained power. We were just watching this airplane on target for the World Trade Center. All of a sudden, boom!
