25|$|Two major service {{changes were}} inaugurated {{with the opening}} of the connection. The first went into effect on Sunday, November 26, 1967, when the Manhattan <b>Bridge</b> <b>connection</b> opened. The second {{occurred}} on Monday, July 1, 1968, when the Williamsburg <b>Bridge</b> <b>connection</b> opened. Additionally, for the 1967 opening, every service in the system was labeled with a letter or number and a color.|$|E
25|$|Although the Cross-Harbor tunnel {{terminal}} site {{is close}} to two major highways and existing rail, many access routes pass through residential neighborhoods. Based on the estimates of the rail tunnel's capacity, traffic {{to and from the}} site could reach thousands of truck trips per day. However, most of those trucks already travel through those highways to use the existing <b>bridge</b> <b>connection.</b>|$|E

The BRT's track {{went over the}} Brooklyn, Manhattan, and Williamsburg Bridges; the Nassau Street Line was to connect to the Brooklyn Bridge, but never did. The {{connections}} {{to the other two}} bridges were built; the Manhattan <b>Bridge</b> <b>connection</b> was cut in 1967 with the building of the Chrystie Street Connection.|$|E
25|$|A <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> {{with the}} {{chairman}} of the printing company De La Rue earned him a job offer. However, he devoted most of his energies to bridge, and by 1936 he was an international bridge player. He {{was one of the great}} British bridge players. He won the Gold Cup in 1937, with teammates Maurice Harrison-Gray (Capt), Skid Simon, Jack Marx and Colin Harding.|$|E
25|$|These new {{services}} {{began to unravel}} in response to commuter complaints about the various routings. Many of the new extensions like the NX and RJ quickly disappeared (April 12, 1968 and June 28, 1968, respectively). The KK (since renamed the K) was discontinued in 1976 as a money-saving measure, ending service via the Williamsburg <b>Bridge</b> <b>connection.</b> Reconstruction of the Manhattan Bridge occurred from 1986 to 1988, in 1995, and from 2001 to 2004. At times, this made the Chrystie Street Connection unavailable for through trains, and made the Grand Street station a terminal for Grand Street Shuttle service to Broadway–Lafayette Street. The Manhattan Bridge reopened fully in 2004.|$|E

The majority are on the American side of the river; there are none that are divided by the international border. Many are very small and uninhabited. However, Grosse Ile on the U.S. side and Bois Blanc (Boblo) Island on the Canadian side have permanent populations. Most are in the southern portion of the waterway, close to where the river empties into Lake Erie. Belle Isle, in the northern section of the river, is a Michigan State Park, and {{is open to the}} public via a <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> with the city.|$|E
25|$|Macleod was {{selected}} as Conservative candidate for Enfield in 1946. Forty-seven applicants were already being considered; through a <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> Macleod arranged {{a meeting with the}} Enfield Conservative Association chairman and persuaded him to add his cv to the list. After interviews he reached the final shortlist of four. Macleod came second after making a poor speech to the assembled Association at the selection meeting, but the winning candidate failed to achieve the required 10% majority. Amid accusations of skulduggery - the members had not been told of this requirement in advance and forty of them, the representatives of two branches, walked out in protest - a second meeting was scheduled, at which Macleod performed much better and won handsomely. Throughout both meetings he had been strongly supported by the local Young Conservatives, who could vote on Association matters despite in some cases being not yet old enough to vote for Parliament – the fifteen year old Norman Tebbit was a branch officer for Ponders End (a working class area).|$|E

The Williamsburg <b>Bridge</b> <b>connection</b> is now used by the M service, which had formerly come into Manhattan on the BMT Nassau Street Line. In June 2010, as part of a round of service cuts, the [...] was rerouted via Chrystie Street onto the IND Sixth Avenue Line, continuing along the V service's former routing north of Broadway–Lafayette Street. At the same time, the V route had been eliminated.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{better than}} {{single-phase}} rectifiers or three-phase half-wave rectifiers, six-pulse rectifier circuits still produce considerable harmonic distortion {{on both the}} AC and DC connections. [...] For very high-power rectifiers the twelve-pulse <b>bridge</b> <b>connection</b> is usually used. [...] A twelve-pulse bridge consists of two six-pulse bridge circuits connected in series, with their AC connections fed from a supply transformer that produces a 30° phase shift between the two bridges. [...] This cancels many of the characteristic harmonics the six-pulse bridges produce.|$|E

30|$|The {{plants of}} {{tropical}} islands had presumably migrated to Taiwan via long distance dispersal and angiosperms of B-II probably migrated to Taiwan by using Route I. However, tropical islands in south Asia, include Philippine and New Guinea, {{are not as}} important as Asian continents on the angiosperm species richness of Taiwan because of two reasons. The first, the number of NEAST is lower in tropical islands than in Asian continent. The second, floristic relationships between Taiwan and tropical islands are not as close as that between Taiwan and Asian continents. Land <b>bridge</b> <b>connections</b> had never existed between Philippine and Taiwan in the Quaternary (Voris 2000; Zeng 1993); therefore, plants migrated from tropical islands to Taiwan were probably dispersed by currents, winds or birds. It is likely because of that migration of plants through long distance dispersal is more difficult than that through land <b>bridge</b> <b>connections.</b>|$|R

40|$|Since the {{vibration}} induced by a train is transferred {{directly to a}} station via a roadbed structure, the elevated station is particularly vulnerable to noise and vibration. To establish more appropriate measures to reduce vibration, the structural behavior and damping characteristics depending on the structural type and the composition of a elevated station should be identified, because the noise inside the station is mainly structure borne noise by {{the vibration}} of a station structure. In this paper, the vibration characteristic changes depending on mechanical connection types between an elevated station and a connected bridge are analyzed. The finite element model for Daecheon Station is constructed {{for the purpose of}} this study, and the analysis is performed using ABAQUS.
