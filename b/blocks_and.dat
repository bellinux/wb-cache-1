Extensive work has been done on the <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> Basu bivariate exponential model over the past several decades.

We call this new model as the <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> Basu bivariate Weibull model. We consider di®erent properties of the <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> Basu bivariate Weibull model. The <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> Basu bivariate Weibull model has four unknown parameters and the maximum likelihood estimators cannot be obtained in closed form. To compute the the maximum likelihood estimators directly, one needs to solve a four dimensional op-timization problem. We propose to use the EM algorithm for computing the maximum likelihood estimators of the unknown parameters. The proposed EM algorithm can be carried out by solving one non-linear equation at each EM step. Our method can be used to compute the maximum likelihood estimators for the <b>Block</b> <b>and</b> Basu bivariate exponential model also.

5|$|Olajuwon {{was highly}} skilled as both an {{offensive}} and defensive player. On defense, his rare combination of quickness and strength allowed him to guard {{a wide range of}} players effectively. He was noted for both his outstanding shot-blocking ability and his unique talent (for a frontcourt player) for stealing the ball. Olajuwon is the only player in NBA history to record more than 200 <b>blocks</b> <b>and</b> 200 steals in the same season. He averaged 3.09 <b>blocks</b> <b>and</b> 1.75 steals per game for his career. He is the only center to rank among the top ten all time in steals. Olajuwon was also an outstanding rebounder, with a career average of 11.1 rebounds per game. He led the NBA in rebounding twice, during the 1989 and 1990 seasons. He was twice named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and was a five-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection.|$|E

5|$|On February 7, 2015, Davis {{injured his}} {{shoulder}} after {{falling off the}} rim when he received an alley-oop. As {{a result of the}} injury, he withdrew from the 2015 NBA All-Star Game, and was replaced on the roster by Dirk Nowitzki and in the starting lineup by LaMarcus Aldridge. Davis missed five games in late February and early March to the shoulder sprain. He returned against the Detroit Pistons with a very dominant game performance of 39 points, 13 rebounds, and 8 blocks, numbers that only Hakeem Olajuwon and Dwight Howard had achieved in a game in the prior 30 years. Davis also reached 437 career blocks, a franchise record. On March 9, Davis tied his career high with 43 points and added 10 rebounds, 2 <b>blocks</b> <b>and</b> a steal in a 114-103 win against the Milwaukee Bucks. On March 15 in a double overtime game against the Denver Nuggets, Davis became the first player in NBA history to tally 36 points, 14 rebounds, 9 <b>blocks</b> <b>and</b> 7 assists in a game since blocks became a statistic in 1973. Only David Robinson has had at least 30 points, 11 rebounds, 8 <b>blocks</b> <b>and</b> 7 assists in a game. On March 16, Davis earned Western Conference Player of the Week for games played Monday, March 9, through Sunday, March 15 and was a finalist for Western Conference Player of the Month of March. In the final game of the regular season, a must-win game that would send the Pelicans to the 2015 NBA Playoffs, Davis recorded 31 points, 13 rebounds, and 3 blocks in a 108-103 victory over the defending-champion San Antonio Spurs. The playoff berth was Davis' first and the franchise's first since 2011. Davis' season {{was one of the most}} impressive in NBA history, finishing the season averaging 24.4 points, 10.2 rebounds, 2.9 <b>blocks,</b> <b>and</b> leading the league in player efficiency rating with 30.89.

He drew up a plat in 1848 that included 11 narrow blocks, 100×200 feet, instead of the standard 200×200 feet. He then brought on Stephen Coffin and William W. Chapman as partners, and dedicated the South Park <b>Blocks</b> <b>and</b> midtown park blocks in 1852. This made them the first official greenspace in Portland. While they were dedicated to the city, they weren't owned by the city until September 22, 1870, when Mayor Bernard Goldsmith and Chapman agreed on selling the South Park <b>Blocks</b> <b>and</b> the two Plaza Blocks (Chapman and Lownsdale Squares) to the city for $6,250. Most {{of the purchase price}} was for the Plaza Blocks, since the park blocks were {{at the edge of the}} developed city.|$|E
