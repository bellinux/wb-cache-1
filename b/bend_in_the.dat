5|$|Although {{there are}} no major flood control dams on Aliso Creek itself, there are 19drop {{structures}}, and while doing nothing to reduce the creek's rainy season surges, the drop structures were constructed to mitigate the catastrophic erosion {{that came with the}} creek's increased flow. Although the creek has a wide floodplain throughout most of Aliso Canyon, a major bottleneck lies {{at the south end of}} the canyon where a sharp <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> creek is constricted between crowded development and steep cliffs. In flooding events, this area generally sustains heavy damage.|$|E
5|$|Battersea Bridge is a five-span {{arch bridge}} with {{cast-iron}} girders and granite piers crossing the River Thames in London, England. It is situated on a sharp <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river, and links Battersea {{south of the}} river with Chelsea to the north. The bridge replaced a ferry service that had operated near the site {{since at least the}} middle of the 16th century.|$|E

The street curves to the southeast at a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Grand River. M-100 merges in from the northeast at Bridge Street. The two highways ran concurrently south to Saginaw Highway. There, Bus. M-43 ended at the intersection with M-43 while M-100 continued south.|$|E
5|$|Commercially navigable only at its mouth, the Saw Mill River {{itself was}} useless {{as a way}} to bring crops to market, {{limiting}} settlement further upriver. Nevertheless, the roots of present-day communities along the river were established during the colonial era. In 1695, a land agent named Isaac See settled at the north bound of Philipse Manor, in the flat land between a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river. Other farmers came to the area, and the settlement ultimately became today's village of Pleasantville.|$|E
5|$|In 1879 {{the bridge}} was taken into public ownership, and in 1885 {{demolished}} and replaced with the existing bridge, designed by Sir Joseph Bazalgette and built by John Mowlem & Co. The narrowest surviving road bridge over the Thames in London, {{it is one of}} London's least busy Thames bridges. The location on a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river makes the bridge a hazard to shipping, and it has been closed many times due to collisions.|$|E

5|$|In 1946, {{there was}} serious {{flooding}} in Salford, {{caused by a}} bottleneck at a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river at Strangeways, {{on the border with}} Manchester. Flooding had been a problem for hundreds of years, and, in 1946, {{the decision was made to}} straighten and widen the river to increase its capacity. Work started in 1951 but it was not until September 1970 that water first flowed through the Anaconda Cut. The total cost of the project was £2m.|$|E
5|$|Responding to this attack, militia Colonel Henry Dodge {{gathered}} {{a force of}} twenty-nine mounted volunteers and set out {{in pursuit of the}} attackers. On June 16, Dodge and his men cornered about eleven of the raiders at a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Pecatonica River. In a brief battle, the Americans killed and scalped all of the Natives. The Battle of Horseshoe Bend (or Battle of Pecatonica) was the first real American victory in the war, and helped restore public confidence in the volunteer militia force.|$|E
5|$|Several other {{significant}} events occurred around 42 Ma, including cessation of metamorphism of the Leech River Schists (resulting from the Metchosin/Crescent Formation being thrust under Vancouver Island) {{and the end}} of strike-slip motion on the Straight Creek Fault; these may reflect the last movement of Siletzia relative to North America. On a broader scale, there was a change in absolute direction of the Pacific plate (marked {{by the end of the}} <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain), and a change in the convergence of the Kula plate with the North American plate.|$|E
50|$|A bend can be {{modified}} {{by most of the}} lines of partition, such as <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> engrailed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancient arms of Fortescue and <b>the</b> <b>bend</b> wavy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ancient coat of Wallop, Earls of Portsmouth.|$|R
50|$|A more {{flexible}} definition of shape takes {{into consideration the}} fact that realistic shapes are often deformable, e.g. a person in different postures, a tree <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> wind or a hand with different finger positions.|$|R
50|$|Glass invented an {{apparatus}} in which cane rods were connected with brass screw joints, creating a flexible rod which coped with <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chimney. A wheel was {{fixed to the}} top of the stock, to prevent jamming.|$|R
5|$|The {{accretion}} of Siletzia {{against the}} North American continent approximately 50 {{million years ago}} (contemporaneous with the initiation of the <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain) was a major tectonic event associated with a reorganization of the earth's tectonic plates. This {{is believed to have}} a caused a shift in the subduction zone, termination of the Laramide orogeny that was uplifting the Rocky Mountains, and major changes in tectonic and volcanic activity across much of western North America.|$|E
5|$|With {{river traffic}} increasing, damage from barge {{collisions}} increased. By 1972, the Greenville Bridge was hit more times by barges {{than any other}} bridge on the Mississippi. The bridge was located close to a sharp <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi; towboats and barges had difficulty making the sharp turn and regaining their course in time to avoid a collision with the bridge. Over the years many {{have not been able}} to make the turn quickly and have hit it. The bridge had become a danger to river traffic.|$|E
5|$|After another {{supermarket}} {{strip to}} the east, a long, gentle divided <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road almost a mile long ends with an overpass where NY55 comes {{in from the}} west. It joins NY22 as the two routes, returning to two lanes, pass through the eastern fringe of the village of Pawling and then by Trinity-Pawling School. Past the village, the railroad tracks edge closer to the highway as NY22 enters the scenic Harlem Valley, which lends {{its name to the}} railroad line. The road curves more gently and takes longer straightaways, with lower density of residential and commercial development. Two miles from Pawling, the Appalachian Trail crosses the road next to the line's Appalachian Trail station. The flag stop allows hikers access to the nearby Pawling Nature Preserve.|$|E
40|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> present paper, {{design and}} {{analysis}} of a 2. 4 GHz printed dipole antenna for wireless communication applications are presented. Measurements on return loss and radiation pattern of this antenna configuration are included <b>in</b> this investigation. <b>The</b> printed dipole is combined with the feeding structure of a microstrip via-hole balun and is fabricated on an FR- 4 printed-circuit-board substrate. Two inevitable discontinuities are introduced by this antenna architecture <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of right-angle <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> microstrip feed line and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dipole’s gap, respectively. The impact of mitering these <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> reflection coefficient, resonance bandwidth and radiation pattern of antenna has been investigated by means of simulation and experiment...|$|R
40|$|The {{energy level}} {{alignment}} at the CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 /copper phthalocyanine (CuPc) interface is investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and {{ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy}} (UPS). XPS reveal a 0. 3 eV downward band <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CuPc film. UPS validate this finding and further reveal negligible interfacial dipole formation – verifying the viability of vacuum level alignment. The highest occupied molecular orbital of CuPc {{is found to be}} closer to the Fermi level than the valance band maximum of CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3, facilitating hole transfer from CH 3 NH 3 PbI 3 to CuPc. However, subsequent hole extraction from CuPc may be impeded by <b>the</b> downward band <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CuPc layer...|$|R
30|$|Following {{this idea}} {{and by the}} third Newton’s law, <b>the</b> local <b>bending</b> moments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> column’s flanges have an “incoming” direction, such as <b>the</b> local <b>bending</b> moments <b>in</b> <b>the</b> beam’s flanges. Therefore, there is no {{inversion}} of the warping and bi-moment direction.|$|R
5|$|At a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> highway, {{there is}} a small patch of development, with a few houses near the highway. At the {{intersection}} with Township Road 529, State Route 664 enters Gallagher Township. Eventually, the large patch of forests in the surroundings come towards a clearing, where the highway intersects with Old Dirt Road. After crossing a stream, State Route 664 gains the moniker of the Coudersport Pike. The highway passes a small patch of development, reaching another clearing in the forest. After entering another forest, State Route 664 ends at an intersection with State Route 44 in the community of Haneyville.|$|E
5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road on low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed the tanks. Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, the tanks penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E
5|$|Dollo's {{specimens}} {{allowed him}} to show that Owen's prehistoric pachyderms were not correct for Iguanodon. He instead modelled the skeletal mounts after the cassowary and wallaby, and put the spike {{that had been on}} the nose firmly on the thumb. He was not completely correct, but he also had the disadvantage of being faced with some of the first complete dinosaur remains. A problem that was later recognised was the bend he introduced into the tail. This organ was more or less straight, as shown by the skeletons he was excavating, and the presence of ossified tendons. In fact, to get the <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tail for a more wallaby or kangaroo-like posture, the tail would have had to be broken. With its correct, straight tail and back, the animal would have walked with its body held horizontal to the ground, arms in place to support the body if needed.|$|E
25|$|Carl Wiman {{described}} the new species Clidastes sternbergii. He noticed evidence for tail <b>bends</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> species Halisaurus sternbergi and Platecarpus tympaniticus. He compared them to <b>the</b> tail <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> ichthyosaurs that support their tail flukes. In one figure, he restored the mosasaur's tail with an upper lobe like ichthyosaurs have. This prescient observation would be confirmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 21st century.|$|R

5|$|For many years, {{the four}} lanes from Sacramento stopped at Riverton, where the {{original}} two-lane road {{continued through the}} canyon and over Echo Summit. The state rejected a proposed $133 million total realignment between Riverton and Kyburz in 1985, instead opting for a less expensive program of spot improvements including new bridges and passing lanes. Portions of the work were completed by 1987, including a four-lane bridge at Riverton (though two lanes are used by traffic turning at Ice House Road at {{the east end of}} the bridge). Between White Hall and Kyburz, a pair of four-lane bridges over the South Fork American River, carrying a realignment across a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river, were dedicated on May 31, 1995, as the El Dorado County Veterans Bridges.|$|E
5|$|In Saginaw, the two {{parallel}} streets continue east and meet M-84 which runs north–south along Bay Street. The {{distance between the}} {{two parallel}} streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south. The intersection with Hill Street {{marks the beginning of}} the connections to the exit3 interchange along a <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> I-675 freeway. Hill Street is one-way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I-675 to either direction of M-58. Two blocks east, Michigan Avenue carries traffic northbound under the freeway, connecting to a ramp to northbound I-675 before continuing north through the city of Saginaw. East of this intersection, State Street curves to the north, intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I-675. A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I-675 to Davenport Avenue. This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M-58.|$|E
5|$|The Benjamin G. Humphreys Bridge, {{the first}} bridge {{to connect the}} two towns, had become {{functionally}} obsolete. Its narrow road had only two lanes with no shoulders. Because of its location near a sharp <b>bend</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River, the bridge had become a hazard to river traffic; barges and towboats frequently collided with it. In 1994, a study concluded that a new bridge was needed and the old one should be torn down. Construction was begun in 2001 and the new bridge opened in 2010. In 2011, the process of removing the old bridge began.|$|E

50|$|Because {{both the}} arch and the tie are mainly subject to axial forces, their cross {{sections}} {{can be very}} small. Usually, transverse <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> deck is bigger than <b>bending</b> <b>in</b> longitudinal direction. Therefore, a concrete deck that spans between the arches is a good solution for bridges with arch distances that are not too large. The concrete deck has longitudinal prestressing tendons <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arch planes.|$|R
