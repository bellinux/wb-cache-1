50|$|Para {{grass is}} native to {{northern}} and central Africa {{and parts of the}} Middle East. It was introduced into Central America but has largely been superseded there by other species of Brachiaria. It was also introduced into the humid, tropical parts of Australia around 1880 and has become widely naturalised in Queensland. By a few decades later it had become naturalised in much of southern Asia and on many Pacific islands, but is confined to its preferred habitat of poorly drained, swampy land. Along with tanner grass, it is planted as a fodder grass in seasonally flooded or swampy habitats, and in ponds in pastures, but it can <b>block</b> <b>irrigation</b> ditches and drains. When used as forage for cattle it is usually controlled by the action of the animals, so it does not become too weedy. When it grows in other habitats, however, it can become noxious. It is aggressive and can form dense stands. It may also have allelopathic effects on other plants, preventing their growth.|$|E
40|$|A {{position}} paper on how water usage is poorly managed by most rural smallholder irrigation farmers hence {{the need for}} well managed water conservation schemes like practicing <b>block</b> <b>irrigation</b> on the plots. In many smallholder irrigation schemes in Zimbabwe poor water use is cited as one common problem. Water is reportedly lost during conveyance, distribution and application in the field. The causes of this problem are varied. Most of the losses {{are said to be}} at or below the field channel gate (Pearce and Armstrong, 1990 : 18). Inequitable distribution of water between blocks, between head and tail users along canals and differential water distribution at field level have been documented (Pazvakavambwa, 1984 a; Pearce and Armstrong, 1990; Donkor. 1991). Over- irrigating has also been cited as another problem, particularly in gravity schemes (Makadho, 1993). These studies, in various ways, have emphasized the need for solutions to be found to the water-management problem in smallholder irrigation. Agritex, the government department with the mandate to develop smallholder irrigation in the country, alongside its extension service mandate, has taken steps. to address poor water use. One strategy that has been employed is the block system of irrigation. This system is currently used in most ‘new’ schemes constructed after 1985, in those that are under rehabilitation as well as in other ‘old’ schemes that are being re-organized. There are perceived advantages associated with this system. These advantages, gleaned by the author from interviews and discussions with a number of Agritex engineers and extensionists, fall into three categories. The most frequently advanced reason is efficient water use through accurate irrigation scheduling. The second advantage which relates to economic aspects of crop production is that it is easier to market the crop produce. Thirdly, <b>block</b> <b>irrigation</b> is conceived as making crop rotations easier to implement which ultimately results in improved maintenance of soil fertility. A related advantage is the possibility of better past and disease control...|$|E

Estimates of the total soil water content from the soil water balance model matched well with neutron-probe readings in the sorghum crop. Model performance by soil layer indicates slight underestimates of soil water content in the upper layers of soil, slight overestimates of soil water content in the lower soil layers, and close agreement between simulated and observed soil water contents in the middle soil layers.

One possible means of eliminating the error is to adjust the root soil water extraction slightly away from the upper levels and toward the lowest levels.

Detailed water management in the block was also monitored to evaluate {{its effect on the}} pesticide contamination. The concentrations of applied pesticides in both <b>block</b> <b>irrigation</b> channel and drainage canal increased to tens of μg/L shortly after their applications. The increase in pesticide concentrations was well correlated with the open of irrigation and drainage gates in the pesticide-applied paddy plots only 1 – 3 days after pesticide application. High concentration of other pesticides, mainly herbicides, was also observed in the inflow irrigation and drainage waters, confirming the popularity of early irrigation and drainage after pesticide application in the area. The requirement of holding water after pesticide application (as a best management practice) issued by the authority was thus not properly followed. In a larger scale of the paddy catchment, the concentration of pesticides also increased significantly to several μg/L in the water of the Kose river shortly after the start of the pesticide application period either in downstream or mid–upstream areas, confirming the effect of current water management to the water quality. More extension and enforcement on water management should be done in order to control pesticide pollution from rice cultivation in Japan...|$|E

This study assessed the level of soil salinization in a communally managed 233  ha Nkhate irrigation scheme in the Lower Shire Valley region of Malawi. Soil samples were collected within the 0 – 0.4  m soil depth from eight randomly selected <b>irrigation</b> <b>blocks.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> water samples were also collected from five randomly selected locations along the Nkhate River which supplies irrigation water to the scheme. Salinity of both the soil and the irrigation water samples was determined using an electrical conductivity (EC) meter. Analysis of the results indicated that even for very low salinity tolerant crops (ECi <  2  dS/m), the irrigation water was suitable for irrigation purposes. However, root-zone soil salinity profiles depicted that leaching of salts was not adequate and that the leaching requirement for the scheme needs to be relooked and always be adhered to during irrigation operation. The study concluded that the crop system at the scheme needs to be adjusted to match with prevailing soil and irrigation water salinity levels.|$|R

40|$|Beavers {{are often}} {{found to be}} in {{conflict}} with human interests by creating nuisances like building dams on flowing water (leading to flooding), <b>blocking</b> <b>irrigation</b> canals, cutting down timbers, etc. At {{the same time they}} contribute to raising water tables, increased vegetation, etc. Consequently, maintaining an optimal beaver population is beneficial. Because of their diffusion externality (due to migratory nature), strategies based on lumped parameter models are often ineffective. Using a distributed parameter model for beaver population that accounts for their spatial and temporal behavior, an optimal control (trapping) strategy is presented in this paper that leads to a desired distribution of the animal density in a region in the long run. The optimal control solution presented, imbeds the solution for a large number of initial conditions (i. e., it has a feedback form), which is otherwise nontrivial to obtain. The solution obtained can be used in real-time by a nonexpert in control theory since it involves only using the neural networks trained offline. Proper orthogonal decomposition-based basis function design followed by their use in a Galerkin projection has been incorporated in the solution process as a model reduction technique. Optimal solutions are obtained through a "single network adaptive critic" (SNAC) neural-network architecture...|$|R
40|$|An agrometeorological {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine soil water balance and to test for specific drought effects in a sorghum crop at Mead, NE. ^ Field experiments were conducted with eight different water treatments in a randomized factorial <b>block</b> <b>irrigation</b> design during 1990 and 1991 growing seasons. Pertinent meteorological, plant, and soil variables were monitored through the season. The components of the water balance equation for the sorghum crop, especially evapotranspiration and soil water content, were calculated using a model that describes the processes of crop transpiration, soil evaporation, and the hydrological balance of the root zone. The simulated (model) and observed (neutron probe readings) soil water content in the root zone compared well for all water treatments with average d-index of agreement 0. 90. ^ A crop specific drought index (CSDI) for sorghum was also developed. This index is based upon the daily soil water balance. The major cause of grain yield data variability was associated with timing of water use during the season and frequency, timing, and amount of irrigation and rainfall. The relative impact of water stress during each of the three periods of growth is reflected by sensitivity coefficients (λ) where (ET a/ET pλ was determined for the three stages of growth. These ratios were used to form a multiplicative model for estimating sorghum grain yield using field data in 1990 and 1991. The CSDI using λs derived from ET a/ET p ratios gave better results than when T a/ET p ratios were used. The resulting model estimates of yield were in close agreement with observed values when tested using an independent data set, and presented better performance when compared with two other models. ^ Examination of ET from a study involving all combinations of irrigation and nonirrigation over three growth stages appears to realistically differentiate coefficients describing sensitivity of sorghum yield to time and amount of water use. We conclude that the inclusion of CSDI-sorghum to extract the yield signal from evapotranspiration as estimated within the soil water balance model will improve monitoring of the impact of drought in relation to sorghum production. ...|$|E

Agronomic traits measured were plant height, stem diameter, biomass, flowering date, panicle exertion, panicle length, leaf area, grain yield, and thousand seed mass at Potchefstroom and Taung experiments. Drought susceptibility index (DSI) was quantified using the formula: DSI = [1 - (Ydi/ Ypi) ]/ [1 - (YD/YP) ] and %yield reduction (%YR) was calculated using the formula: %YR = (Ypi –Ydi) / Ypi x 100. Significant variations among genotypes with regard to grain yield (GYLD), plant height (PH), panicle length (PL), biomass (BM), stem diameter (SD), panicle exertion (PEx), and 1000 seed mass (TSM) were observed at Potchefstroom under rain fed conditions, while under irrigated conditions significant variations were only observed for GYLD, PH, PL, BM, days to 50 % flowering (DF), SD, leaf area (LA), PEx and TSM. At Potchefstroom genotypes varied significantly with regard to PH, PL, BM, DF, SD, LA, PEx and TSM under rain fed conditions, while under irrigated conditions genotypes varied with all traits measured with exception of harvest index (HI) and relative water content (RWC). At Potchefstroom, soil water deficits significantly affected GYLD, PH, HI, PEx and RWC, while at Potchefstroom soil water deficits significantly affected GYLD, PH, SD, LA, PEx, TSM and RWC. Genotypes varied with their level of resistance/ susceptibility to soil water deficits at both Potchefstroom and Taung. Some remarkable correlations among traits measured were observed under rain fed and irrigated conditions and across the treatments at both Potchefstroom and Taung. At Potchefstroom, significant correlation was only observed between drought susceptibility index (DSI) and PH under rain fed conditions, while at Potchefstroom negative and significant correlation was only observed between DSI and GYLD under rain fed conditions. At Potchefstroom, GYLD under rain fed significantly related to GYLD under irrigated conditions and across the treatments. However, GYLD under irrigated conditions significantly related to GYLD across the treatments. At Potchefstroom, GYLD under rain fed conditions significantly correlated with GYLD across soil water regimes, while GYLD under irrigated conditions significantly correlated with GYLD across the treatments. Genotypes that exhibited the combination of high yield potential and resistant traits were recommended. Genotypes that exhibited high resistant traits with low yield potential were recommended for breeders to incorporate those traits into susceptible genotypes with high yield potential.

Wilczk], a field experiment was conducted in split plot arrangements using randomized complete <b>block</b> design (<b>Irrigation</b> after 50, 100, 150 and 200 mm evaporation from pan class A as main plots and mycorrhiza species, Glomus mosseae, G. intraradices and a non-inoculated treatment as sub-plots) with three replications at the Research field of Urmia university in 2009. Results showed that irrigation after 50 mm evaporation from pan class A, and plant inoculated with G. intraradices produced the highest grain yield (1678. 5 kg/ha and 1537. 6 kg/ha, respectively), total dry weight, leaf dry weight, leaf area index, crop growth rate, relative growth rate and net assimilation rate. In Contrast, irrigation after 200 mm evaporation from class A pan and non-inoculated treatment produced the lowest grain yeild (1159. 2 and 1301. 9 kg/ha, respectively). Reducing the irrigation distance led {{to an increase in}} total dry weight, leaf dry weight, leaf area index, crop growth rate, relative growth rate and net assimilation rate. Despite lower grain yield in water deficit condition, AM fungi inoculation significantly reduced the effect of stress on grain yield. All inall, both mycorrhizae species significantly (P 0. 05) increased the grain yield of mungbean under well-watered and water deficit condition...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} {{technical}} efficiency of paddy production {{in one of}} the major irrigation schemes in Sri Lanka with special emphasis on the usage of agrochemical inputs and determinants of technical efficiency. The presence of technical inefficiency and its causality is investigated using a stochastic production frontier model. Data for the estimation was gathered from a farm household survey covering 225 households across five administrative units from 3 <b>irrigation</b> <b>blocks</b> for the cultivation season 2003 / 2004. The results of the production function show negative relationships between yield and the cost of pesticides indicating an over use of pesticides. The average technical efficiency was estimated to be 0. 37. Among the determinants of inefficiency estimates considered, the importance of credit and extension services on improving efficiency of farmer stand out while the farmers come from neighbouring villages appear efficient than the farmers settled in the villages.
