40|$|Objective. This study {{examined}} the occurrence and duration of sedentary <b>bouts</b> and explored the cross-sectional association with health indicators in children applying various operational definitions of sedentary <b>bouts.</b> Methods. Accelerometer data of 647 children (10 - 13 years old) were collected in five European countries. We analyzed sedentary time (= 100 cpm within <b>bouts.</b> Health indicators included anthropometrics (i. e. waist circumference and body mass index (BMI)) and in a subsample from two European countries (n = 112) fasting capillary blood levels of glucose, C-peptide, high-density- and low-density cholesterol, and triglycerides. Data collection took place from March to July 2010. Associations were adjusted for age, gender, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity, total wear time and country. Results. Occurrence of sedentary <b>bouts</b> varied largely between the various definitions. Children {{spent most of their}} sedentary time in <b>bouts</b> of L- 5 min while <b>bouts</b> of >= 20 min were rare. Linear regression analysis revealed few significant associations of sedentary time accumulated in <b>bouts</b> of >= 5 - 30 min with health indicators. Moreover, we found that more associations became significant when allowing no tolerance time within sedentary <b>bouts.</b> Conclusion. Despite a few significant associations, we found no convincing evidence for an association between sedentary time accumulated in <b>bouts</b> and health indicators in 10 - 13 year old children...|$|R

40|$|Physical {{activity}} and sedentary behavior are central components of lifetime weight control; however, {{our understanding of}} dimensions of these behaviors in childhood is limited. This study investigated free-living activity pattern characteristics and the individual variability of these characteristics in 84 lean and obese Chinese children (7 – 9 [*]y) {{during the school day}} and over the weekend. Activity pattern characteristics were established from triaxial accelerometry (StayHealthy RT 3). Results indicated that children's free-living activity is characterized by many short-duration, low-intensity <b>bouts</b> of movement. Obese children take longer rest intervals between <b>bouts</b> and engage in fewer activity <b>bouts</b> both at school and at home. Intraindividual variability in activity patterns was low during school days but high for the rest intervals between <b>bouts</b> and number of activity <b>bouts</b> per day at the weekend. Finding ways to reduce the rest time between <b>bouts</b> of movement and increase the number of movement <b>bouts</b> a child experiences each day is an important next step...|$|R
