The toll increase proposal drew 221 public comments and opponents outnumbered supporters by about 3 to 1.

50|$|Simon Tatham and Gareth Taylor {{have shown}} that the fifth row can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> via an {{infinite}} series of moves http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/solarmy/; this result is also in a paper by Pieter Blue and Stephen Hartke http://www.math.unl.edu/~shartke2/. If diagonal jumps are allowed, the 8th row can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> but not the 9th row. It has also been shown that, in the n-dimensional version of the game, the highest row that can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>is</b> 3n-2. Conway's weighting argument demonstrates that the row 3n-1 cannot <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> It <b>is</b> considerably harder to show that row 3n-2 can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> (see the paper by Eriksson and Lindstrom).|$|R

5|$|In 821, {{the year}} of Coenwulf's death, a council was held in London at which Coenwulf {{threatened}} to exile Wulfred if the archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 pounds to the king. Wulfred is recorded to have agreed to these terms, but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf's death, with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf's brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so {{it is evident that}} some accommodation had <b>been</b> <b>reached</b> by that time. Wulfred had probably resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year.|$|E
5|$|In January 1942, Terboven {{announced}} the German administration would be wound down.

Quisling remained doubtful it would happen since Germany and Norway {{were in the midst}} of complex peace negotiations that could not be completed until peace had <b>been</b> <b>reached</b> on the Eastern Front, while Terboven insisted that the Reichskommissariat would remain in power until such peace came about. Quisling could nevertheless be reasonably confident that his position within the party and with Berlin was unassailable, even if he was unpopular within Norway, something of which he was well aware.|$|E

Meanwhile, after protracted negotiations between the governments of Australia, Britain, Canada, India, New Zealand and South Africa, agreement had <b>been</b> <b>reached</b> to establish an integrated formation with the aim of increasing the political significance of their contribution, as well as facilitating the solution of the logistic and operational problems faced by the various Commonwealth contingents.|$|E
5|$|Miners of the Pittston Coal Company {{were glad}} that a {{settlement}} had <b>been</b> <b>reached</b> {{and that they}} would once again be receiving health and retirement funds. However, because they were without benefits for such a long time, many people had gone into financial trouble. During the strike, the costs of health care had to be paid out of pocket and many miners did not have the resources to do so. As a result, many miners had accumulated debt. Another direct result of the Pittston Strike was the formation of the Coal Act. This act was established in 1992. This act made it mandatory by law for mining companies to provide health and retirement benefits for its workers.|$|E
