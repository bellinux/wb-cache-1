40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} {{is critical for}} successful evolution of eukaryotic organisms in adaptation to changing environments. In the opportunistic human fungal pathogens, the Cryptococcus pathogenic species complex, C. neoformans primarily undergoes <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction,</b> while C. deneoformans undergoes both unisexual and <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> During both unisexual and bisexual cycles, {{a common set of}} genetic circuits regulates a yeast-to-hyphal morphological transition, that produces either monokaryotic or dikaryotic hyphae. As such, both the unisexual and bisexual cycles can generate genotypic and phenotypic diversity de novo. Despite the similarities between these two cycles, genetic and morphological differences exist, such as the absence of an opposite mating-type partner and monokaryotic instead of dikaryotic hyphae during C. deneoformans unisexual cycle. To better understand the similarities and differences between these modes of sexual reproduction, we focused on two cellular processes involved in sexual reproduction: cell-cell fusion and karyogamy. We identified orthologs of the plasma membrane fusion protein Prm 1 and the nuclear membrane fusion protein Kar 5 in both Cryptococcus species, and demonstrated their conserved roles in cell fusion and karyogamy during C. deneoformans α-α unisexual reproduction and C. deneoformans and C. neoformans a-α <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Notably, karyogamy occurs inside the basidum during <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> in C. neoformans, but often occurs earlier following cell fusion during <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> in C. deneoformans. Characterization of these two genes also showed that cell fusion is dispensable for solo unisexual reproduction in C. deneoformans. The blastospores produced along hyphae during C. deneoformans unisexual reproduction are diploid, suggesting that diploidization occurs early during hyphal development, possibly through either an endoreplication pathway or cell fusion-independent karyogamy events. Taken together, our findings suggest distinct mating mechanisms for unisexual and <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> in Cryptococcus, exemplifying distinct evolutionary trajectories within this pathogenic species complex...|$|E
40|$|In fungi, {{unisexual}} reproduction, where sexual {{development is}} initiated without {{the presence of}} two compatible mating type alleles, has been observed in several species that can also undergo traditional <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction,</b> including the important human fungal pathogens Cryptococcus neoformans and Candida albicans. While unisexual reproduction has been well characterized qualitatively, detailed quantifications are still lacking for aspects of this process, such as the frequency of recombination during unisexual reproduction, and how this compares with <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Here, we analyzed meiotic recombination during a-a unisexual and a-a <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> of C. neoformans. We found that meiotic recombination operates {{in a similar fashion}} during both modes of sexual reproduction. Specifically, we observed that in a-a unisexual reproduction, the numbers of crossovers along the chromosomes during meiosis, recombination frequencies at specific chromosomal regions, as well as meiotic recombination hot and cold spots, are all similar to those observed during a-a <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> The similarity in meiosis is also reflected by the fact that phenotypic segregation among progeny collected from the two modes of sexual reproduction is also similar, with transgressive segregation being observed in both. Additionally, we found diploid meiotic progeny were also produced at similar frequencies in the two modes of sexual reproduction, and transient chromosomal loss and duplication likely occurs frequently and results in aneuploidy and loss of heterozygosity that can span entire chromosomes. Furthermore, in both a-a unisexual and a-a <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction,</b> w...|$|E
40|$|The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans can undergo a-α {{bisexual}} and uni{{sexual reproduction}}. Completion of both sexual reproduction modes requires similar cellular differentiation processes and meiosis. Although <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> generates {{equal number of}} a and α progeny and is far more efficient than unisexual reproduction under mating-inducing laboratory conditions, the α mating type dominates in nature. Population genetic studies suggest that unisexual reproduction by α isolates might have contributed to this sharply skewed distribution of the mating types. However, the predominance of the α mating type and the seemingly inefficient unisexual reproduction observed under laboratory conditions present a conundrum. Here, we discovered a previously unrecognized condition that promotes unisexual reproduction while suppressing <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Pheromone is the principal stimulus for bisexual development in Cryptococcus. Interestingly, pheromone and other components of the pheromone pathway, including the key transcription factor Mat 2, are not necessary but rather inhibitory for Cryptococcus to complete its unisexual cycle under this condition. The inactivation of the pheromone pathway promotes unisexual reproduction despite the essential role of this pathway in non-self-recognition during <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Nonetheless, the requirement for the known filamentation regulator Znf 2 and the expression of hyphal or basidium specific proteins remain the same for pheromone-dependent or independent sexual reproduction. Transcriptome analyses and an insertional mutagenesis screen in mat 2 Δ identified calcineurin being essential for this process. We further found that Znf 2 and calcineurin work cooperatively in controlling unisexual development in this fungus. These findings indicate that Mat 2 acts as a repressor of pheromone-independent unisexual development while serving as an activator for a-α bisexual development. The bi-functionality of Mat 2 might have allowed it {{to act as a}} toggle switch for the mode of sexual development in this ubiquitous eukaryotic microbe...|$|E
50|$|Realistic {{models for}} human {{societies}} {{ask for a}} <b>bisexual</b> mode of <b>reproduction</b> whereas {{in the definition of}} an RDBP one simply speaks of a law of reproduction. However the notion of an average reproduction rate per individual (Bruss 1984) for bisexual processes shows that for all relevant questions for the long-term behavior of human societies it is justified for simplicity to assume asexual reproduction. This is why certain limiting results of Klebaner (1984) and Jagers & Klebaner (2000) bear over to RDBPs. Models {{for the development of a}} human society in time must allow for interdependence between the different components. Such models are in general very complicated and risk to become intractable. This led to the idea not to try to model the development of a society with a (single) realistic RDBP but rather by a sequence of control actions defining a sequence of relevant short-horizon RDBPs.|$|R

40|$|Computer {{experiments}} that mirror the evolutionary dynamics of sexual and asexual organisms as they occur in nature, tested features proposed {{to explain the}} evolution of sexual recombination. Results show that this evolution is better described as a network of interactions between possible sexual forms, including diploidy, thelytoky, facultative sex, assortation, bisexuality, and division of labor between the sexes, rather than a simple transition from parthenogenesis to sexual recombination. Diploidy was shown to be fundamental {{for the evolution of}} sex; <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> emerged only among anisogamic diploids with a synergistic division of reproductive labor; and facultative sex was more likely to evolve among haploids practicing assortative mating.

40|$|Many planktonic organisms produce 'resting' stages {{when the}} {{environmental}} conditions deteriorate. Like seeds, resting stages can survive unfavourable conditions. The crustacean Daphnia normally reproduces {{by means of}} parthenogenetically produced normal, not resting, eggs-but occasionally switches to <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction,</b> which results in two resting eggs encased in a robust structure carried {{on the back of}} the female. This 'ephippium' is shed with the next moult, and can survive dormant for many years. The induction of resting-egg production requires multiple environmental stimuli, one of them being photoperiod(1, 2). The switch from production of parthenogenetic eggs to resting eggs in Daphnia has recently been shown to be influenced by a maternal food effect(3). Here we present evidence that female Daphnia transmit information not only about food but also on photoperiod to their offspring, and influence the production of resting eggs in the next generation. The combined maternal effects can be relevant for the correct timing of resting-egg production-for example, in discriminating between spring and autumn condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to develop a modified genetic algorithm for solving the multi-objective optimization problem focused on Pareto based approach. Multi-Objective <b>Bisexual</b> <b>Reproduction</b> Genetic Algorithm (MOBRGA) is a new GA proposed herein. MOBRGA uses a Darwin’s sexual selection concept, and different types and rates of mutation when creating offspring. When comparing MOBRGA with other algorithms, the results showed that MOBRGA was competitive to others in some problems such as Shaffer’s and Murata’s problem. From experiments, MOBRGA could show the Pareto front. It could find non-dominated solutions to the problems. In the other words, it could solve the multi-objective optimization problems. As an example of applications, MOBRGA was applied for a computer network design. A computer network design is a multi-objective optimization problem, where many objectives are simultaneously considered. When designing computer network using MOBRGA, a set of solutions that met the specification of products was resulted. The solutions found the user’s requirements and product...|$|E
40|$|Zyginidia pullula is a grass-dwelling {{leafhopper}} {{characterized by}} a <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> mode. In this species, some females collected in Northern Italy, when mated with males, gave origin to an exclusively female brood. Here, we demonstrated that in these lineages an infection by a new strain of Wolbachia pipientis—designated as wZygpul—was detected by amplifying and sequencing the wsp and 16 S rRNA genes. About half of the female progeny were characterized by intersexual phenotypes, i. e. showing upper pygofer appendages, a typical male secondary sexual feature. The karyological analysis proved that while phenotypically normal females had a female genotype, those with upper pygofer appendages had a male genotype and were thus feminized males. The complete removal of W. pipientis after tetracycline treatment of morphologically normal females, and the consequent re-appearance of males in the brood, permitted us to connect the feminizing effect {{with the presence of}} the bacterium. This is the first case of feminization by W. pipientis in an XX/X 0 sexdetermination system, and is the second case reported in insects...|$|E

40|$|Although <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> {{has proven}} to be highly successful, {{parthenogenetic}} all-female populations occur frequently in certain taxa including the whiptail lizards of the genus Aspidoscelis. Allozyme analysis revealed a high degree of fixed heterozygosity in these parthenogenetic species 1, 2 supporting the view that they originated from hybridization events between related sexual species. It has remained unclear how the meiotic program is altered to produce diploid eggs while maintaining heterozygosity. Here we show that meiosis commences with twice the number of chromosomes in parthenogenetic versus sexual species, a mechanism that provides the basis for generating gametes with unreduced chromosome content without fundamental deviation from the classic meiotic program. Our observation of synaptonemal complexes and chiasmata demonstrate that a typical meiotic program occurs and that heterozygosity is not maintained by bypassing recombination. Instead, fluorescent in situ hybridization probes that distinguish between homologs reveal that bivalents form between sister chromosomes, the genetically identical products of the first of two premeiotic replication cycles. Sister chromosome pairing provides a mechanism for the maintenance of heterozygosity, which is critical for offsetting the reduced fitnes...|$|E
40|$|Currently, {{approximately}} 3000 {{species of}} stick insects are known; however, chromosome numbers, which range between 21 and 88, {{are known for}} only a few of these insects. Also, centromere banding staining (C-banding) patterns were described for fewer than 10 species, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was applied exclusively in two Leptynia species. Interestingly, 10 – 25 % of stick insects (Phasmatodea) are obligatory or facultative parthenogenetic. As clonal and/or <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> can affect chromosomal evolution, stick insect karyotypes need to be studied more intensely. Chromosome preparation from embryos of five Phasmatodea species (Medauroidea extradentata, Sungaya inexpectata, Sipyloidea sipylus, Phaenopharos khaoyaiensis, and Peruphasma schultei) from four families were studied here by C-banding and FISH applying ribosomal deoxyribonucleic acid (rDNA) and telomeric repeat probes. For three species, data on chromosome numbers and structure were obtained here for the first time, i. e., S. inexpectata, P. khaoyaiensis, and P. schultei. Large C-positive regions enriched with rDNA were identified in all five studied, distantly related species. Some of these C-positive blocks were enriched for telomeric repeats, as well.

40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans {{is a human}} fungal {{pathogen}} with {{a defined}} sexual cycle. Nutrient-limiting conditions and pheromones induce a dimorphic transition from unicellular yeast to multicellular hyphae {{and the production of}} infectious spores. Sexual reproduction involves cells of either opposite (bisexual) or one (unisexual) mating type. Bisexual and unisexual reproduction are governed by shared components of the conserved pheromone-sensing Cpk 1 MAPK signal transduction cascade and by Mat 2, the major transcriptional regulator of the pathway. However, the downstream targets of the pathway are largely unknown, and homology-based approaches have failed to yield downstream transcriptional regulators or other targets. In this study, we applied insertional mutagenesis via Agrobacterium tumefaciens transkingdom DNA delivery to identify mutants with unisexual reproduction defects. In addition to elements known to be involved in sexual development (Crg 1, Ste 7, Mat 2, and Znf 2), three key regulators of sexual development were identified by our screen: Znf 3, Spo 11, and Ubc 5. Spo 11 and Ubc 5 promote sporulation during both bisexual and unisexual reproduction. Genetic and phenotypic analyses provide further evidence implicating both genes in the regulation of meiosis.

40|$|Cryptococcus neoformans {{is a human}} fungal {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} lethal infections of the lung and central nervous system in immunocompromised individuals. C. neoformans has a defined bipolar sexual life cycle with a and a mating types. During the sexual cycle, which can occur between cells of opposite mating types (<b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction)</b> or cells of one mating type (unisexual reproduction), a dimorphic transition from yeast to hyphal growth occurs. Hyphal development and meiosis generate abundant spores that, following inhalation, penetrate deep into the lung to enter the alveoli, germinate, and establish a pulmonary infection growing as budding yeast cells. Unisexual reproduction has been directly observed only in the Cryptococcus var. neoformans (serotype D) lineage under laboratory conditions. However, hyphal development has been previously associated with reduced virulence and the serotype D lineage exhibits limited pathogenicity in the murine model. In this study we show that the serotype D hyperfilamentous strain XL 280 a is hypervirulent in an animal model. It can grow inside the lung of the host, establish a pulmonary infection, and then disseminate to the brain to cause cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Surprisingly, this hyperfilamentous strain triggers an immune response polarized towards Th 2 -type immunity, which is usually observed in the highly virulent sibling species C. gattii, responsible for the Pacific Northwest outbreak.

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} is conserved and maintained in all major eukaryotic lineages. The fungus Cryptococcus neoformans {{is known to}} undergo a-? bisexual mating and also unisexual mating, with bisexual mating being far more efficient under laboratory conditions. During bisexual mating, the mating types of the progeny are segregated in the Mendelian fashion, {{with half of the}} progeny inheriting the mating type a and the other half inheriting the mating type ?. However, MAT? dominates in the environment {{as well as in the}} clinical settings. Given that similar factors such as pheromone and environmental conditions are known to stimulate both unisexual and bisexual mating, it is unknown how and when C. neoformans chooses one mode of reproduction over the other. One important event that takes place during sexual development is the transmission of parental mitochondrial DNA. During <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> between isogamic a and ? cells, most of the progeny inherit the mitochondrial DNA from only the a parent. How this eukaryotic microbe selects and preserves only one parental mitochondrial DNA is unclear. Here, we have identified a key transcription factor Mat 2 as the prezygotic decision maker for the transmission of mitochondrial DNA to the progeny. Mat 2 also cooperates with postzygotic control to ensure tight uniparental mitochondrial DNA inheritance during bisexual mating. Although Mat 2 is absolutely critical for bisexual mating, our studies indicate that the absence of Mat 2 (or under conditions when Mat 2 is repressed) promotes C. neoformans cells to undergo unisexual development. Thus, the findings of this study advanced our understanding of the regulation of different developmental trajectories by genetic and environmental factors...|$|E
40|$|Sexual {{development}} enables microbial pathogens {{to purge}} deleterious mutations from the genome and drives genetic {{diversity in the}} population. Cryptococcus neoformans is a human fungal pathogen with a defined sexual cycle. Nutrient-limiting conditions and pheromones induce a dimorphic transition from unicellular yeast to multicellular hyphae {{and the production of}} infectious spores. C. neoformans has a defined a –α opposite sexual cycle (bisexual reproduction); however, > 99 % of clinical and environmental isolates are of the α mating type. Interestingly, α cells can undergo α–α unisexual reproduction, even involving genotypically identical cells. A central question is why would cells mate with themselves given that sex is costly and typically serves to admix pre-existing genetic diversity from genetically divergent parents? Sexual reproduction generates abundant spores that following inhalation, they penetrate deep into the alveoli of the lung, germinate, and establish a pulmonary infection growing as budding yeast. Therefore sex has been linked with virulence; however, hyphal development has been previously associated with reduced virulence and thus the roles of morphogenesis in virulence have not been extensively analyzed. To further understand the role of unisexual reproduction in C. neoformans we will investigate the evolutionary implications of α–α mating, explore its role in pathogenesis, and we will dissect the signaling pathway that regulates sexual development. We isolated α–α unisexual reproduction progeny from the hyperfilamentous strain XL 280 and subjected to a variety of phenotypic and genotypic assays (including whole genome sequencing and CGH). We found that unisexual and <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction</b> frequently generates phenotypic and genotypic diversity de novo, including aneuploidy. Aneuploidy was responsible for the observed phenotypic changes, as chromosome loss restoring euploidy results in a wild-type phenotype. Other genetic changes, including diploidization, chromosome length polymorphisms, SNPs, and indels, were also generated. Our study suggests that the ability to undergo unisexual reproduction may be an evolutionary strategy for eukaryotic microbial pathogens, enabling de novo genotypic and phenotypic plasticity and facilitating rapid adaptation to novel environments, such as the mammalian host. Interestingly aneuploidy strains that were fluconazole resistant were as virulent as the WT parental strain XL 280. Although XL 280 belongs to the serotype D lineage that exhibits limited pathogenicity, in further studies we found that is hypervirulent in the murine model. It can grow inside the lung of the host, establishing a pulmonary infection, and then disseminates to the brain to cause cryptococcal meningoencephalitis. Surprisingly, this hyperfilamentous strain triggers an immune response polarized towards Th 2 -type immunity, which is characterized by less protective immunity and is usually observed in the highly virulent sibling species C. gattii, responsible for the Pacific Northwest outbreak. These studies: 1) provide a technological advance that will facilitate analysis of virulence genes and attributes in C. neoformans var. neoformans (serotype D), and 2) reveal the virulence potential of serotype D that is broader and more dynamic than previously appreciated. Bisexual and unisexual reproduction are governed by shared components of the conserved pheromone-sensing Cpk 1 MAPK signal transduction cascade and by Mat 2, the major transcriptional regulator of the pathway. However, the downstream targets of the pathway are largely unknown, and homology-based approaches have failed to yield downstream transcriptional regulators or other targets. To address this question we applied an insertional mutagenesis via Agrobacterium tumefaciens transkingdom DNA delivery to identify mutants with unisexual reproduction defects. In addition to elements known to be involved in sexual development (Crg 1, Ste 7, Mat 2, and Znf 2), three key regulators of sexual development were identified by our screen: Znf 3, Spo 11, and Ubc 5. Spo 11 and Ubc 5 promote sporulation during both bisexual and unisexual reproduction. Genetic and phenotypic analyses provide further evidence implicating both genes in the regulation of meiosis. Phenotypic analysis of sexual development showed that Znf 3 is required for hyphal development during unisexual reproduction and also plays a central role during <b>bisexual</b> <b>reproduction.</b> Znf 3 governs cell fusion and pheromone production through a pathway parallel to and independent of the pheromone signaling cascade. Surprisingly, Znf 3 participates in transposon silencing during unisexual reproduction and may serve as a link between RNAi silencing and sexual development. In further studies we found that Znf 3 is required for sex- and mitotic-induced (SIS and MIS). SIS is less efficient in znf 3 unilateral matings and is abolished in znf 3 x znf 3 bilateral matings, similar to the phenotypes of rdp 1 mutants (the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase of RNAi pathway). Znf 3 is also required for transgene-induced mitotic silencing; znf 3 mutations abrogate silencing of repetitive transgenes during vegetative growth. Znf 3 tagged with mCherry is localized in the cytoplasm in bright, distinct foci. Co-localization of Znf 3 with the P-body marker Dcp 1 -GFP further supports the hypothesis that Znf 3 is a novel element of the RNAi pathway and operates to defend the genome during sexual development and vegetative growth. In concussion our studies provide further understanding of unisexual reproduction as an evolutionary successful strategy. Dissertatio...|$|E
