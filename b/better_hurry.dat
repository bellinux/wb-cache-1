6000|$|... "She seems {{a little}} excitable," [...] Wolfenden remarked. [...] "All right, Selby, you'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up and {{get what you want}} to eat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not know}} what you are talking about," [...] replied Yellow Franz; [...] "but if you want to pray you'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up about it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If, in {{the course}} of {{fourteen}} days," [...] I said, [...] "they eat half of what is on this yacht, they will want a fairly long time for every meal. We had <b>better</b> not <b>hurry</b> them, or they won't get through a quarter of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Roger {{threw his}} cap {{high in the}} air, with a lusty shout that startled the <b>better</b> passers-by, <b>hurrying</b> towards their homes; for it was now long after dark, and {{although}} the town watch patrolled the streets regularly, prudent citizens did not care to be abroad after nightfall.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, sir." [...] Adam {{was filled}} with curiosity, but he thought it <b>better</b> not to <b>hurry</b> matters. All would come in good time. Then the three men {{returned}} home, leaving Mr. Caswall {{to spend the night}} in Liverpool.|$|R
6000|$|... "You 'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up your apple, for {{if it is}} {{n't done}} pretty soon, you 'll have to leave it, Pug," [...] said Tom, looking annoyed.|$|E
6000|$|... "We'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> {{along and}} get good seats before folks begin to crowd. I {{want to sit}} near the curtain and see if any of Smitthers's lot are 'round." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> down an' across," [...] said Copple. [...] "Reckon {{the hounds}} will jump that bear or some one else will get there first. We got to skedaddle!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{never will}} tell it. What I mean is, that Raymond wanted the sanction--of the affair at the church--because {{he saw that}} I would never do without it. Therefore, for him, the sooner we had it the <b>better,</b> and, to <b>hurry</b> it on, {{he was ready to}} take any pledge." ...|$|R
6000|$|An {{involuntary}} {{rustle of}} her dress caught his ear, and, lifting the lantern, he saw her at once; but did not speak, as if afraid of frightening her still more, for her pale face and the appealing gesture of the outstretched hand told her fear and need <b>better</b> than her <b>hurried</b> words,-- ...|$|R
60|$|As he {{left his}} lodgings he heard the whistle of a train. The scene down the street {{was similar to the}} one which had greeted him the day before, only the dust was not blowing so thickly. He went into a hotel for his meal and fared <b>better,</b> {{watching}} the <b>hurry</b> and scurry of men. After he had finished he strolled toward the station.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then, I {{guess we}} had <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> home, or {{we may be}} late for lunch," [...] said Sam, after {{consulting}} his watch. [...] "It is quarter of twelve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That'd be {{all right}} for the {{immediate}} present. But it's not best for the future. George, a deserter is a deserter!... <b>Better</b> <b>hurry.</b> Leave the girl to me till tomorrow." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> over to {{that little}} {{pavillion}} on the point," [...] suggested the unknown. [...] "We can wait there until this shower is over. It {{is not likely}} to rain so heavily very long." ...|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{descending}} {{towards the}} distant farmsteads, {{he followed the}} summit of the rise, and Foster, who understood that a flow is a soft bog, plodded after him without objecting. The heather was tangled and rough, and hid the stones he now and then stumbled against, but it was <b>better</b> to <b>hurry</b> than be left with a long distance to cover in the dark. Indeed, as he caught his feet in the wiry stems and fell into holes, he frankly admitted the absurdity of his adventure, a sense of which amused him now and then. He was in a highly civilized country, there were railways and telegraph lines not far off, and he was lurking like an ancient outlaw among the bogs! It looked as if there must be better ways of meeting his difficulties, but he could not see one. Anyhow, he had determined to save his partner, and now, if his plans were hazy and not very wise, {{it was too late to}} make a sweeping change.|$|R
5000|$|Tennessee {{head coach}} Butch Jones spoke on his team's gameplay, [...] "I'm very, {{very proud of}} our kids. Just the fight in them, the will to win. But again, you can't have seven turnovers, you can't turn the {{football}} over, you can't have the penalties we had. You have almost 700 yards of offense and you can't turn the football over. It's the details. Especially when you go on the road, the small details add up to the big details." [...] Jones continued, speaking on the team's emotions and their next opponent, [...] "That's life in the Southeastern Conference. It's not for everyone. The toughness that's involved day-to-day, week-to-week — the grind — {{and we have to}} get <b>better</b> in a <b>hurry</b> because we've got the No. 1 ranked team in the country coming in. So we have to improve on our deficiencies from this week." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My other way," [...] {{said the}} Sergeant, {{going on as}} easy as ever, [...] "is to try that bold {{experiment}} to which I have alluded. I think I have formed a pretty correct estimate of Miss Verinder's temperament. She is quite capable (according to my belief) of committing a daring fraud. But she is too hot and impetuous in temper, and too little accustomed to deceit as a habit, to act the hypocrite in small things, and to restrain herself under all provocations. Her feelings, in this case, have repeatedly got beyond her control, {{at the very time}} when it was plainly her interest to conceal them. It is on this peculiarity in her character that I now propose to act. I want to give her a great shock suddenly, under circumstances that will touch her to the quick. In plain English, I want to tell Miss Verinder, without a word of warning, of Rosanna's death--on the chance that her own <b>better</b> feelings will <b>hurry</b> her into making a clean breast of it. Does your ladyship accept that alternative?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Don't you think,' Elsie suggested, 'we had <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> down on our cycles to Lungern {{and call}} some {{men from the}} village to help us? We are two girls, and alone. What {{can we do to}} aid him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here come Quest and the Inspector. They {{are making}} a circuit to avoid the fire. The cowboy with them must have shown them the way. We'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up and find out if they've seen {{anything}} of Miss Lenora." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up," [...] he advised, thanking {{her for the}} {{assistance}} and relaunching the boat. [...] "Two miles of stiff trail from here to Happy Camp. No wood until you get there, so you'd best hustle along. Good-by." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{read and}} read again these lines, {{with only the}} sense of their {{insufficiency}} in doing {{the effect of the}} bitterness in his heart. If the letter was insulting, it was by no means as insulting as {{he would have liked to}} make it. Whether it would be wounding enough was something that depended upon the person whom he wished to wound. All that was proud and vain and cruel in him surged up at the thought of the trick that had been played upon him, and all that was sweet and kind and gentle in him, when he believed the trick was a genuine appeal, turned to their counter qualities. Yet, feeble and inadequate as his letter was, he knew that he could not do more or worse by trying, and he so much feared that by waiting he might do less and <b>better</b> that he <b>hurried</b> it into the post at once. If his mother had been at hand he would have shown it her, though he might not have been ruled by her judgment of it. He was glad that she was not with him, for either she would have had her opinion of what would be more telling, or she would have insisted upon his delaying any sort of reply, and he could not endure the thought of difference or delay.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Why, why' have I {{made this}} evening such {{a point of}} our not all dining together? Well, because I've all day been so wanting you alone that I finally couldn't bear it, and that there didn't seem any great reason why I should try to. THAT came to me--funny as it may at first sound, with all the things we've so wonderfully got into the way of bearing for each other. You've seemed these last days--I don't know what: more absent than ever before, too absent for us merely to go on so. It's all very well, and I {{perfectly}} see how beautiful it is, all round; but there comes a day when something snaps, when the full cup, filled to the very brim, begins to flow over. That's {{what has happened to}} my need of you--the cup, all day, has been too full to carry. So here I am with it, spilling it over you--and just for the reason that is the reason of my life. After all, I've scarcely to explain that I'm as much in love with you now as the first hour; except that there are some hours--which I know when they come, because they almost frighten me--that show me I'm even more so. They come of themselves--and, ah, they've been coming! After all, after all--!" [...] Some such words as those were what DIDN'T ring out, yet it was as if even the unuttered sound had been quenched here in its own quaver. It was where utterance would have broken down by its very weight if he had let it get so far. Without that extremity, {{at the end of a}} moment, he had taken in what he needed to take--that his wife was TESTIFYING, that she adored and missed and desired him. [...] "After all, after all," [...] since she put it so, she was right. That was what he had to respond to; that was what, from the moment that, as has been said, he [...] "saw," [...] he had to treat as the most pertinent thing possible. He held her close and long, in expression of their personal reunion--this, obviously, was one way of doing so. He rubbed his cheek, tenderly, and with a deep vague murmur, against her face, that side of her face she was not pressing to his breast. That was, not less obviously, another way, and there were ways enough, in short, for his extemporised ease, for the good humour she was afterwards to find herself thinking of as his infinite tact. This last was partly, no doubt, because the question of tact might be felt as having come up at the end of a quarter of an hour during which he had liberally talked and she had genially questioned. He had told her of his day, the happy thought of his roundabout journey with Charlotte, all their cathedral-hunting adventure, and how it had turned out rather more of an affair than they expected. The moral of it was, at any rate, that he was tired, verily, and must have a bath and dress--to which end she would kindly excuse him for the shortest time possible. She was to remember afterwards something that had passed between them on this--how he had looked, for her, during an instant, at the door, before going out, how he had met her asking him, in hesitation first, then quickly in decision, whether she couldn't help him by going up with him. He had perhaps also for a moment hesitated, but he had declined her offer, and she was to preserve, as I say, the memory of the smile with which he had opined that at that rate they wouldn't dine till ten o'clock and that he should go straighter and faster alone. Such things, as I say, were to come back to her--they played, through her full after-sense, like lights on the whole impression; the subsequent parts of the experience were not to have blurred their distinctness. One of these subsequent parts, the first, had been the not inconsiderable length, to her later and more analytic consciousness, of this second wait for her husband's reappearance. She might certainly, with the best will in the world, had she gone up with him, have been more in his way than not, since people could really, almost always, <b>hurry</b> <b>better</b> without help than with it. Still, she could actually hardly have made him take more time than he struck her taking, though it must indeed be added that there was now in this much-thinking little person's state of mind no mere crudity of impatience. Something had happened, rapidly, with the beautiful sight of him and with the drop of her fear of having annoyed him by making him go to and fro. Subsidence of the fearsome, for Maggie's spirit, was always, at first, positive emergence of the sweet, and it was long since anything had been so sweet to her as the particular quality suddenly given by her present emotion to the sense of possession.|$|R
6000|$|Roberts, {{tearing off}} the coat, and flinging {{it on the}} bed: [...] "You know it won't do, Willis. And now I must give the whole thing up. You'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> off and explain to Agnes why I could not come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up, or you won't {{get your}} chores done before breakfast. No {{time for a}} 'go as you please' now," [...] said Frank; and both boys laughed, for {{it was an old}} joke of theirs, and rather funny.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not on your life!" [...] the boy replied. [...] "I've got to {{stay here}} and boss the show. You'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> along, too. It's Thursday morning and you know the people come in early. Lord, what a guy you look!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Some good advice,--you know," [...] said Harkutt, hastily. [...] "But come, you'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> {{over to the}} squire's. You know YOU'VE {{made the}} discovery; YOUR {{evidence}} is important, and there's a law that obliges you to give information at once." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You had <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> {{your men}} on," [...] {{he said to}} the colonel with whom Hector had acted; [...] "the enemy will be on the ramparts in a minute, and you may be sure that they won't let us off without trouble from their guns." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then you had <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> {{down to the}} shore. There is a steam launch there, and I {{heard the}} officer in command say he was bound for the Iowa and the Brooklyn. If {{you want to get}} on your ship, I presume he will take you along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never--but, by Jove, you had {{a narrow}} escape," [...] Ennison exclaimed. [...] "Annabel, I begin to see why you are here. Think! Had you not <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> back before Sir John discovers? You are his wife right enough. You can tell me the rest another time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We working-girls {{have got}} to economize. Besides, it's quite comfortable--fairly comfortable--inside, and it's only for a week." [...] She yawned. [...] "I believe I'm falling asleep again. I'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> in and go to bed. Good-bye, Wally dear. You've been wonderful. Mind you go and get a good breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then we'd <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up, Oswald,' said Herbert Le Breton, 'for guides are {{the most}} tyrannical set {{of people on the}} entire face of this planet. I shall have another cup of coffee before I go, though, if the guides swear at me roundly in the best Roumansch for it, anyhow.' ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{ghost of}} a smile {{appeared}} on Soames' face. They had <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up with their questions! He well knew his uncle's method (the ideal one) of at once saying: [...] "I propose, then, that the report and accounts be adopted!" [...] Never let them get their wind--shareholders were notoriously wasteful of time! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I've got my {{raincoat}} and {{a waterproof}} cap, {{and that is}} one comfort," [...] he told himself. [...] "But I had <b>better</b> <b>hurry</b> up and see if I can't find Phil and the others before it gets too dark. I wish there was somebody here who could tell me where to go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You had <b>better</b> <b>hurry,</b> sir," [...] I called out. [...] "I can't {{hold this}} dog very long." [...] And, indeed, Lord Edward {{had made a}} run toward the agent, which jerked me very {{forcibly}} in his direction. But a movement by the tramp had quickly brought the dog back to his more desired victim.|$|E
6000|$|... "Hope I {{can get a}} room," [...] I said, as I {{followed}} him out on the platform. He held up his lantern so that the light would shine in my face. [...] "There's a hotel down the street a block or so. <b>Better</b> <b>hurry</b> and look sharp. Holston's not {{a safe place for}} a stranger at night." ...|$|E
