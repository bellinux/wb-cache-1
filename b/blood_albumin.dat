5000|$|The {{cause of}} {{calciphylaxis}} is unknown. It {{does not seem}} to be an immune type reaction. In other words, calciphylaxis is not a hypersensitivity reaction (i.e., allergic reaction) leading to sudden local calcification. Clearly, additional factors are involved in calciphylaxis. It is also known as calcific uremic arteriolopathy; however, the disease is not limited to patients with kidney failure. The current belief is that in end-stage kidney disease, abnormal calcium and phosphate homeostasis result in the deposition of calcium in the vessels, also known as metastatic calcification. Once the calcium has been deposited, a thrombotic event occurs within the lumen of these vessels, resulting in tissue infarction. It is unknown what the triggers are that cause the thrombotic and ischemic event. [...] Reported risk factors include female sex, obesity, elevated calcium*phosphate product, medications such as warfarin, vitamin D derivatives e.g. calcitriol, calcium-based binders, or systemic steroids, protein C or S deficiency, low <b>blood</b> <b>albumin</b> levels, and diabetes mellitus.|$|E
50|$|MARS is an extracorporeal {{hemodialysis}} system {{composed of}} three different circuits: <b>blood,</b> <b>albumin</b> and low-flux dialysis. The blood circuit uses a double lumen catheter and a conventional hemodialysis device to pump the patient’s blood into the MARS FLUX, a biocompatible polysulfone high-flux dialyser. With a membrane surface area of 2.1 m2, 100 nm of thickness and a cut-off of 50 KDa, the MARSFLUX is essential to retaining the albumin in the dialysate. Blood is dialysed against a human serum albumin (HSA) dialysate solution that allows blood detoxification of both water-soluble and protein-bound toxins, {{by means of the}} presence of albumin in the dialysate (albumin dialysis). The albumin dialysate is then regenerated in a close loop in the MARS circuit by passing through the fibres of the low-flux diaFLUX filter, to clear water-soluble toxins and provide electrolyte/acid-base balance, by a standard dialysis fluid. Next, the albumin dialysate passes through two different adsorption columns; protein-bound substances are removed by the diaMARS AC250, containing activated charcoal and anionic substances are removed by the diaMARS IE250, filled with cholestyramine, an anion-exchange resin. The albumin solution is then ready to initiate another detoxifying cycle of the patient's blood that can be sustained until both adsorption columns are saturated, eliminating the need to continuously infuse albumin into the system during treatment (Fig. 1).|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveDespite 50 {{years of}} lung {{preservation}} research, the optimal preservation technique is undefined. Using {{data from a}} national cohort, we investigated outcomes with different preservation methods after adult lung transplantation. MethodsEarly (30 -day), late (30 -day to 3 -year), and overall (3 -year) mortalities, adjusted for differences in donor and recipient characteristics, were compared by using Cox regression. Intensive care unit length of stay {{and the number of}} rejection episodes were secondary outcomes. ResultsSix hundred eighty-one eligible lung transplantations between July 1995 and June 2003 were preserved with Euro–Collins solution (n = 284), <b>blood</b> <b>albumin</b> (n = 139), core cooling (n = 107), or low potassium dextran solution (n = 151). There was significantly increased use of low potassium dextran solution over time (P <. 001). Unadjusted 3 -year survival was similar across the groups (P =. 72), with the highest 3 -year survival in the low potassium dextran group (62 %; 95 % confidence interval, 51 %– 72 %) and the lowest in the <b>blood</b> <b>albumin</b> group (49 %; 95 % confidence interval, 39 %– 58 %). Risk-adjusted early (P =. 70), late (P =. 27), and overall (P =. 72) survival was similar across the groups and was not affected by ischemic time.

5000|$|In the 1860s Carl Friedrich Wilhelm Ludwig had {{developed}} some perfusion techniques {{for the study}} of isolated organs. From the beginning the heart had served as the principal organ for these [...] "extravital" [...] investigations, and most of Ringer's physiological work relied on Ludwig's experimental model. In a classic series of experiments performed between 1882 and 1885, Ringer began with an isolated frog heart suspended in a 0.75% solution of sodium chloride. He then introduced additional substances (for example, <b>blood</b> and <b>albumin)</b> to the solution and observed the effects on the beating heart. He demonstrated that the abnormally prolonged ventricular dilation induced by pure sodium chloride solution is reversed by both <b>blood</b> and <b>albumin.</b> Ringer showed that small amounts of calcium in the perfusing solution are necessary for the maintenance of a normal heartbeat, a discovery he made after realising that instead of distilled water, his technician was actually using tap water containing (in London) calcium at nearly the same concentration as the blood. Ringer thus gradually perfected Ludwig's perfusion technique by proving that if small amounts of potassium are added to the normal solution of sodium chloride, isolated organs can be kept functional for long periods of time.|$|R

30|$|Photonic sensing {{technology}} is a new and accurate measurement technology for bio-sensing applications. In this paper, a two-dimensional photonic crystal ring resonator based sensor is proposed and designed to detect the glucose concentration in urine over the range of 0 gm/dl- 15 gm/dl. The proposed sensor is consisted of two inverted “L” waveguides and a ring resonator. If the glucose concentration in urine is varied, the refractive index of the urine is varied, which in turn the output response of sensor will be varied. By having the aforementioned principle, the glucose concentration in urine, glucose concentration in <b>blood,</b> <b>albumin,</b> urea, and bilirubin concentration in urine are predicted. The size of the proposed sensor is about 11.4 µm× 11.4 µm, and the sensor can predict the result very accurately without any delay, hence, this attempt could be implemented for medical applications.|$|E

25|$|Epilepsy is {{a common}} {{neurological}} disease that is characterized by recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures.
