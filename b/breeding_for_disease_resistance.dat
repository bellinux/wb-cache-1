We characterize the spatial structure of the pathogen population and of the general plant environment-with undetermined but present abiotic constraints-not by using direct notation such as flower time or rainfall but by using plant behavior (i. e., leaf symptom severity, indirect notation). The analysis indicates areas with higher or lower risk of disease and reveals a correlation between the symptomatic control and the effective level of disease for sunflowers.

The discovery of necrotrophic effectors has given <b>breeding</b> <b>for</b> <b>disease</b> <b>resistance</b> new methods and tools. For P. nodorum, three effectors SnToxA, SnTox 1 and SnTox 3, have been well characterised. Unlike tan spot, no one effector has a dominating role. Genetic analysis of various mapping populations and pathogen isolates has shown that different effectors have varying impact and that epistatic interactions also occur. As a result the deployment of these effectors for SNB breeding is more complex. We have deleted the three effectors in a strain of P. nodorum and measured effector activity and disease potential of the triple knockout mutant. The culture filtrate causes necrosis in several cultivars and the strain causes disease, albeit the overall levels are less than in the wild type. Modelling of the field disease resistance scores of cultivars from their reactions to the microbially-expressed effectors SnToxA, SnTox 1 and SnTox 3 is significantly improved by including {{the response to the}} triple knockout mutant culture filtrate.
