40|$|Some predators sidestep {{environments that}} render them {{conspicuous}} to the sensory systems of prey. However, these challenging environments are unavoidable for certain predators. Stenolemus giraffa is an assassin bug that feeds on web-building spiders; the web is {{the environment in}} which this predator finds its prey, but it also forms part of its preys’ sophisticated sensory apparatus, blurring the distinction between environment and sensory systems. Stenolemus giraffa needs to <b>break</b> <b>threads</b> in the web that obstruct its path to the spiders, and such vibrations can alert the spiders. Using laser vibrometry, this study demonstrates how S. giraffa avoids alerting the spiders during its approach. When <b>breaking</b> <b>threads,</b> S. giraffa attenuates the vibrations produced by holding on to the loose ends of the broken thread and causing them to sag prior to release. In addition, S. giraffa releases the loose ends of a broken thread one at a time (after several seconds or minutes) and in this way spaces out the production of vibrations in time. Furthermore, S. giraffa was found to maximally reduce the amplitude of vibrations when <b>breaking</b> <b>threads</b> that are prone to produce louder vibrations. Finally, S. giraffa preferred to <b>break</b> <b>threads</b> in the presence of wind, suggesting that this araneophagic insect exploits environmental noise that temporarily impairs the spiders’ ability to detect vibrations. The predatory behaviour of S. giraffa seems to be adaptated in intricate manner for bypassing the sophisticated sensory systems of web-building spiders. These findings illustrate how the physical characteristics of the environment, along with the sensory systems of prey can shape the predatory strategies of animals. 14 page(s...|$|R

The significant cost of linen derives not only from the difficulty of working with the thread, but also because the flax plant itself requires a great deal of attention.

40|$|We {{improved}} the imbedded fiber retraction (IFR) method {{as a simple}} method to obtain the interfacial tension between polymer melts. A force balance equation for a fiber in an immiscible matrix by Cohen and Carriere is solved for a more realistic fiber shape at later stage of retraction.

In dynamic viscoelasticity method, we determine the interfacial tension by fitting the Palierne theory with dynamic viscoelastic data.

40|$|We {{studied the}} snap-off of nematic liquid {{crystalline}} droplets originating from the Rayleigh–Taylor instability at the isotropic–nematic interface in suspensions of charged gibbsite {{in water and}} sterically stabilized gibbsite in bromotoluene. We found that droplet snap-off strongly depends on the director field structure inside the thinning neck, which {{is determined by the}} ratio of the splay elastic constant and the anchoring strength of the nematic phase to the droplet interface relative to the thickness of the thinning neck. If anchoring is weak, which is the case for aqueous gibbsite, this ratio is comparable to the thickness of the <b>breaking</b> <b>thread.</b> As a result, the thinning neck and pending drop have a uniform director field and droplet snap-off is determined by the viscous properties of the liquid crystal as well as by thermal fluctuations of the interface. On the other hand, in sterically stabilized gibbsite where anchoring is strong, this ratio is significantly smaller than the neck thickness. In this case, the neck has an escaped radial director field and the neck thinning is retarded close to snap-off due to a topological energy barrier involved in the separation of the droplet from the threa...|$|R
40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{tension of the}} uncompatibilized and compatibilized blends of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyamide 6 (PA 6) has been measured by the <b>breaking</b> <b>thread</b> method. Different types of compatibilizer precursors have been used: poly(ethylene-co-acrylic acid) (Escor 5001, by Exxon) having 6 wt% concentration of acrylic acid; an ethylene-acrylic acid zinc ionomer (Iotek 4200); a triblock copolymer with polystyrene end blocks and a rubbery poly(ethylene–butylene mid block (SEBS) (Kraton G 1652); and SEBS-g-MA (Kraton FG 1901 X) with 2 wt% maleic anhydride. The compatibilizing efficiency of {{the different types of}} the compatibilizer precursors towards the blends has been evaluated quantitatively by the values of the {{interfacial tension}} obtained.

40|$|Abstract—Chips {{are moving}} from {{single-core}} systems to much more complex, heterogeneous manycore systems. While heterogeneous architectures promise high performance, {{they are also}} challenging our ability to port our existing operating systems to abstract the heterogeneous components into a unified architecture. Baseline solutions to resolve heterogeneity issues within manycores use Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) for applications running on slave processors to access a traditional monolithic kernel running on a common master node. Micro-kernels are once again re-emerging to eliminate the central bottleneck of the monolithic kernel. In both cases the RPC methods used for communications increase the overhead of system services, counter to the desire of <b>breaking</b> <b>threads</b> up into finer grained services to match and scale with in-creasing numbers of processors. In this paper we show how new invocation mechanisms built as hardware primitives in combination with new a new hw/sw co-designed microkernel can resolve heterogeneity issues in a framework that supports the level of scalability required for next generation systems. We present experimental results {{as well as a}} new queuing model to show how both monolithic and microkernels that rely historical interrupt mechanisms cannot support scalability beyond small numbers of processors. We also show through these results the potential scalability of a hardware kernel based microkernel with new lightweight invocation mechanisms.

40|$|The {{influence}} of the PPE content in a miscible PS/PPE phase on the surface tension and polarity of PS/PPE mixtures, and on the interfacial tension in PP/(PS/PPE) and POM/(PS/PPE) blend systems was investigated. Surface tensions, sigma(T), and polarity, x(p), were experimentally determined {{by means of the}} pendant drop analysis technique, and were compared to the values predicted theoretically via Macleod's theory. The interfacial tension, sigma(12), was determined both from the dynamic <b>breaking</b> <b>thread</b> method, and from the pendant drop analysis, which is an equilibrium method. The experimental values were compared to those predicted from the harmonic mean equation. Good agreement was found between the absolute values for sigma(12) Obtained from both the techniques. The surface tension of the PS/PPE mixtures, in a temperature range of 230 - 260 degrees C, appears to be unaffected by the presence of PPE, within the experimental error of the measurements. These findings were in good agreement with the prediction of a(T) from Macleod's theory. The interfacial tension of the PP/(PS/PPE) or POM/(PS/PPE) blend systems {{did not seem to be}} affected significantly when using a PS/PPE phase with a higher content of PPE. Finally, calculations showed that PPE causes the polarity of the PS/PPE mixtures to increase slightly from a value of 0. 17 for pure PS to 0. 20 for pure PPE.
