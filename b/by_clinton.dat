5|$|As {{part of a}} 1996 {{initiative}} to curb illegal immigration, Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) on September 30, 1996. Appointed <b>by</b> <b>Clinton,</b> the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform recommended reducing legal immigration from about 800,000 people a year to about 550,000.|$|E

5|$|After his Test debut, Hunt was {{expected}} to be the Queensland fullback in the first match of the three game State of Origin series. However, Queensland selectors decided to stay with incumbent Origin fullback Matt Bowen. The selectors reconsidered after Queensland lost the first game, selecting Hunt for the second match. In his State of Origin debut, Hunt ran with the ball seventeen times, making 196 metres. He missed the third Origin game because of a foot injury, sustained in the Broncos' Round 15 match, and was replaced <b>by</b> <b>Clinton</b> Schifcofske.|$|E
5|$|Five {{days after}} the battle ended, on October 24, 1781, the British fleet sent <b>by</b> <b>Clinton</b> to rescue the British army arrived. The fleet picked up several Loyalists who had escaped on October 18, and they {{informed}} Admiral Thomas Graves that they believed Cornwallis had surrendered. Graves picked up several more Loyalists along the coast, and they confirmed this fact. Graves sighted the French Fleet, but chose to leave because he was outnumbered by nine ships, and thus he sent the fleet back to New York.|$|E
5|$|On October 28, 2016, Comey {{notified}} Congress {{that the}} FBI started looking into newly discovered emails. Law enforcement officials stated while investigating allegedly illicit text messages from Anthony Weiner husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin, to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina, they discovered e-mails related to Clinton's private server on {{a laptop computer}} belonging to Anthony Weiner. On November 6, Comey notified Congress that the FBI had not changed its conclusion reached in July.

5|$|Ranking Democratic {{committee}} member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican {{use of a}} secret hold {{to slow down the}} Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee. The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced <b>by</b> <b>Clinton</b> and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.|$|E
5|$|Washington's Continental Army, also newly {{funded by}} $20,000 in French gold, {{delivered}} the final {{blow to the}} British in 1781, after a French naval victory allowed American and French forces to trap a British army in Virginia, preventing reinforcement <b>by</b> <b>Clinton</b> from the North. The surrender at Yorktown on October 19, 1781, {{marked the end of}} major fighting in North America. Cornwallis failed to appear at the official surrender ceremony, and sent General Charles O'Hara as his proxy; Washington then had General Benjamin Lincoln accept the surrender in his place.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, hundreds of state-maintained highways without a posted route number {{were given a}} signed designation for the first time. The Altona–Chazy Landing state highway was designated as NY191. At its east end, the route connected to Vermont RouteF-2 on Isle La Motte {{by way of a}} ferry across part of Lake Champlain. The ferry was discontinued in 1937; however, the endpoints of NY191 remained unchanged. On April1, 1980, ownership and maintenance of all of NY191 was transferred from the state of New York to Clinton County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government. The entirety of the highway was designated as CR23 <b>by</b> <b>Clinton</b> County and NY191 was truncated to consist only of the portion of the route between Sciota and Chazy. The route was decommissioned on March 18, 2015.|$|E

5|$|The Clinton Presidential Center was {{dedicated}} on November 18, 2004. Although it was raining, {{the ceremony was}} attended by approximately 30,000 people (including notable figures such as Willie Mays, Robin Williams, and Barbra Streisand) and included a 20-minute speech made <b>by</b> <b>Clinton,</b> who had recently undergone bypass surgery. It also included performances by Bono, the African Drum Ballet and the Philander Smith Collegiate Choir, {{as well as an}} invocation given by Floyd Flake and video tribute from Nelson Mandela. Four U.S. presidents (Clinton, Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush were present; former president Gerald R. Ford could not attend due to health concerns) were on the same stage together. All three other presidents spoke at the event as well. Overall, the ceremony lasted two hours and featured six speakers.|$|E
5|$|The House Select Committee on Benghazi {{was created}} in May 2014 and {{conducted}} a two-year investigation related to the 2012 attack. Its actions were often seen {{through the prism of}} domestic politics. This was especially the case in September 2015, when House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy credited the Benghazi hearings with lowering Clinton's poll numbers, thereby contradicting the Republicans' previous talking points on the investigation. On October 22, 2015, Clinton testified at an all-day and nighttime session before the committee. The hearing included many heated exchanges between committee members and Clinton and among the committee members themselves. Clinton was widely seen as emerging largely unscathed from the hearing, because of what the media perceived as a calm and unfazed demeanor and a lengthy, meandering, repetitive line of questioning from the committee. The committee issued competing final reports in June 2016 that broke along partisan lines, with the Republican report offering some new details about the attack but no new evidence of culpability <b>by</b> <b>Clinton.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{segment of}} NY22 north of US11, named Hemmingford Road, was state-maintained until September1, 1988, when {{ownership}} {{and maintenance of}} {{that part of the}} route was transferred to Clinton County as part of a highway maintenance swap between the county and the state of New York. Following the swap, it was co-designated as CR34 <b>by</b> <b>Clinton</b> County. In 2008, the signed northern terminus of NY22 was moved to the east end of its overlap with US11 in Mooers. The official alignment of NY22 was not changed, however, as the New York State Department of Transportation still considered the Canadian border to be NY22's northern terminus until ca. July 2014.|$|E

5|$|Washington at {{this time}} moved his {{headquarters}} from Middlebrook in New Jersey up to New Windsor on the Hudson, with an army of 10,000. The British, led <b>by</b> <b>Clinton,</b> made a move up the Hudson against American posts at Verplanck's Point and Stony Point, and both places succumbed; but a counter-offensive was briefly successful by the patriots led by General Anthony Wayne. Clinton was able to shut off Kings Ferry in the end, {{but it was a}} strategic loss; he could proceed no farther up the river due to American fortifications and Washington's army. The skirmishes at Verplanck's Point and at Stony Point demonstrated that the continental infantry had become quite formidable and were an enormous boost to morale.|$|E
