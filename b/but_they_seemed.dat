25|$|However, {{this work}} has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan {{highlighted}} that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to {{the extent that they}} were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.|$|E
25|$|In Flanders, {{this period}} {{started with the}} {{appearance}} of two new successful newspaper comics, Bakelandt by Hec Leemans and the extremely successful Kiekeboe by Merho. <b>But</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> to be {{at the same time the}} final successes of a slowly dying system, and comics in Flanders are more and more centered around albums as well. Successful series and authors are few and far between, and most, like Urbanus or F. C. De Kampioenen, are only a local success. A few peripheral figures like Ever Meulen, who is mainly an illustrator, or Kamagurka, who is more of a cartoonist, do become successful in Wallonia, France and the Netherlands, but apart from those exceptions, the main method for Flemish comics artists to become successful is still being published by the three French language publishers.|$|E

Margarita said about it: [...] "It was a very solid and romantic story. I never stopped loving him but one day it didn't seem right any more, it was politics, politics, politics, and I needed nurturing." [...] An unnamed friend of those years is quoted by Paul Routledge in his biography of Brown as recalling: [...] "She was sweet and gentle and obviously cut out to make somebody a very good wife. She was bright, too, though not like him, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> made for each other." ...|$|E

A reviewer from Metal Fanatix rated it at 71 out of 100 and explained, [...] "they incorporate death metal and hardcore influences, {{and it makes}} their music almost like a deathcore band... The songs are good on this four song MCD, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seem</b> to lack direction.

Vulcan, with March-Phillipps and his second in command Appleyard on board, headed for Duchessa d'Aosta. [...] As they approached, a few men could be seen on the after deck of the merchant vessel, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> to take no notice of the tug other than to shine a torch in its direction. At the same time, Folbots under the command of Hayes from Nuneaton, were being paddled towards Likomba and Burundi, which were moored together. Challenged by a watchman on Burundi, they persuaded him with their reply that it was the ship's captain coming back on board. The men from the canoes boarded Burundi and the two man crew on watch jumped overboard. After planting explosive charges on the anchor chain, the commandos guided Nuneaton alongside Likomba to take her and the Burundi in tow.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, Gittings {{traveled}} to California {{on the advice}} of Donald Webster Cory, to visit the office of the new ONE, Inc., an early homophile organization that dedicated itself to providing support to homosexuals in the US. While in California, she met Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin, who had co-founded the Daughters of Bilitis (DOB) in San Francisco. [...] "She was a cute, curly-haired young woman wearing a shift and sandals. I remember she had this satchel, a backpack— I'd never seen anything like it. Or her", Lyon remembered. At her first meeting of the Daughters of Bilitis in someone's living room, Gittings brought up the obscurity of the name, which she thought was impractical, difficult to pronounce and spell, and referenced a fictional bisexual character, not even homosexual. [...] "Even then I was pretty assertive...What were they doing with a name like that? It wasn't very nice of me, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> to take it with reasonably good spirits." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} half of 1994, the K Foundation {{attempted}} to interest galleries in staging Money: A Major Body of Cash, but even old friend Jayne Casey, director of the Liverpool Festival Trust, was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate. The Tate, in Liverpool, {{wanted to be part of}} the 21st Century Festival I'm involved with,' says Casey. 'I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition; at first they were encouraging, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> nervous about the personalities involved.' A curt fax from... the gallery curator, informed Casey that the K Foundation's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly", leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options. The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States, but no insurer would touch the project. An exhibition at Kilmainham Jail in Dublin was then considered, but no sooner had a provisional August date been set for it than the duo changed their minds yet again. [...] "Jimmy said: 'Why don't we just burn it?' remembers Drummond. 'He said it in a light-hearted way, I suppose, hoping I'd say: 'No, we can't do that, let's do this...' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do." [...] Cauty: [...] "We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it. That was about six weeks before we did it. It was too long, it was a bit of a nightmare." ...|$|E

2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the trial on 27 March 2008, Brendan Harris was found guilty of murder, and the judge allowed the names of both Harris and Herbert, which had been concealed during the trial, to be made public. Detective Superintendent Mick Gradwell of Lancashire Police said {{it was one of the}} most violent murders he had come across in his career: [...] "I do not think Herbert and Harris have recognised how violent the attack was. They have just done it without thinking, <b>but</b> <b>they</b> <b>seemed</b> to have enjoyed it, and carried on remorselessly kicking at two very defenceless people who were unable to protect themselves because of the level of violence inflicted upon them... I am very critical of some of the parents involved. I really don't think they have taken completely seriously how repulsive this incident was...". He said that when Harris was initially interviewed about the assaults he was [...] "laughing and joking" [...] with his mother.|$|E
