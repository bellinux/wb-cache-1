40|$|Tidal sand {{ridges and}} long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> are rhythmic bed forms that form {{as a result}} from the {{interaction}} between the forcing of oscillatory tidal currents and the topography of the bottom. Gaining knowledge of these patterns is important for navigation and to know their response to sand mining. Tidal sand ridges are rotated cyclonically (5 − 30 degrees) with respect to the direction of the tidal current. The typical distance between successive crests is about 10 km. In contrast, crests of long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> can be rotated cyclonically (~ 60 degrees) or anticyclonically (~ 30 degrees) with respect to the tides and their crest-to-crest distance is about 1. 5 km. Several studies have explained the initial growth and the wavelength and orientation of tidal sand ridges. However, it is unclear why the crests of cyclonic oriented long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> are rotated further cyclonically than the crests of tidal sand ridges. One potential explanation for that might be the necessity to account for the vertical structure of the tidal currents. In fact, this is the working hypothesis of this study. The model {{used in the present study}} extends the shallow water equations and introduces a formulation for multiple levels of water. These levels are coupled to the adjacent ones by means of considering the stresses at the interfaces. This assumption allows the vertical structure of the tidal currents to be incorporated in the model. Furthermore, the model includes a sediment transport formulation with a critical bed shear stress below which no sediment moves, as well as the presence of the elliptical tidal currents. The present work provides new insights in the initial formation of long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> and tidal sand ridges, though the main focus is on which tidal conditions allow long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> to emerge and how long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> form. The results of this study show that the agreement between observed and modelled long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> improves when the vertical structure of the tidal currents is included. In fact, the crests of modelled cyclonic oriented long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> rotate further cyclonically by ~ 25 degrees due to Ekman veering and enhanced eccentricity of the tidal ellipse near the seabed...|$|E
40|$|An {{idealized}} {{model is}} proposed {{to explain the}} appearance of the long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> that have been recently observed in shallow tidal seas. The model assumes that these bedforms grow due to tide-topography interaction. The water motion is described by means of the depth averaged shallow water equations and the bottom evolution is governed by conservation of sediment mass. The sediment transport formulation includes a critical bottom stress below which no sediment moves. Also, anisotropic sediment transport, due to local bottom slopes in the longitudinal and transverse directions, is taken into account. A linear stability analysis of the flat bottom configuration reveals that different bottom patterns can emerge. In accordance with previous analyses, for strong tidal currents, the fastest growing modes are sand banks. However, if the tidal currents are elliptical and the maximum bottom stress is just above its threshold value for the initiation of sediment motion, the model shows the presence of further growing modes which resemble the long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> observed in the field...|$|E
40|$|Tidal sand {{ridges and}} long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> are {{large-scale}} bedforms that are observed on continental shelves. They {{differ in their}} wavelength and in their orientation {{with respect to the}} principal direction of tidal currents. Previous studies indicate that tidal sand ridges appear in areas where tidal currents are above 0. 5  m s− 1, while long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> occur in regions where the maximum tidal current velocity is slightly above the critical velocity for sand erosion and the current is elliptical. An idealized nonlinear numerical model was developed to improve the understanding of the initial formation of these bedforms. The model governs the feedbacks between tidally forced depth-averaged currents and the sandy bed on the outer shelf. The effects of different formulations of bed shear stress and sand transport, tidal ellipticity and different tidal constituents on the characteristics of these bedforms (growth rate, wavelength, orientation of the preferred bedforms) during their initial formation were examined systematically. The results show that the formulations for bed shear stress and slope-induced sand transport are not critical for the initial formation of these bedforms. For tidal sand ridges, under rectilinear tidal currents, increasing the critical bed shear stress for sand erosion decreases the growth rate and the wavelength of the preferred bedforms significantly, while the orientation angle slightly decreases. The dependence of the growth rate, wavelength and the orientation of the preferred bedforms on the tidal ellipticity is non-monotonic. A decrease in tidal frequency results in preferred bedforms with larger wavelength and smaller orientation angle, while their growth rate hardly changes. In the case of joint diurnal and semidiurnal tides, or spring-neap tides, the characteristics of the bedforms are determined by the dominant tidal constituent. For long <b>bed</b> <b>waves,</b> the number of anticyclonically/cyclonically oriented bedforms with respect to the principal current direction increases as the ellipticity of the cyclonic/anticyclonic tidal currents increases. Besides, under anticyclonic tidal currents, the growth rate of cyclonically oriented long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> increases as the tidal ellipticity increases. The model was also used to provide a possible explanation {{for the fact that the}} Dutch Banks have a larger wavelength than that of the Flemish Banks in the North Sea...|$|E

The large-scaled spatial {{variation}} in these dynamics and the smaller-scaled behaviour of individual marine bedforms are largely unknown. Sea-bed dynamics are relevant {{for the safety}} of shipping, and therefore for monitoring strategies, and for offshore engineering projects and archaeological investigations. To date, sea-bed dynamic studies in the North Sea that are based on high-resolution echo soundings are mostly local. Recently, sufficient time series of modern, digital echo sounder surveys have become available to allow for a Netherlands Continental Shelf-wide quantification of vertical dynamic trends {{as well as for the}} detailed analysis of the morphodynamics of marine bedforms.

40|$|Sand {{waves are}} large <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> on the seabed, being a few metres high and lying {{hundreds}} of metres apart. In some cases, these sand waves occur in navigation channels. If these sand waves reduce the water depth to an unacceptable level and hinder navigation, {{they need to}} be dredged. It has been observed in the Bisanseto Channel in Japan that the sand waves tend to regain their shape after dredging. In this paper, we address modelling of this regeneration of sand waves, aiming to predict this process. For this purpose, we combine a very simple, yet effective, amplitude-evolution model based on the Landau equation, with measurements in the Bisanseto Channel. The model parameters are tuned to the measured data using a genetic algorithm, a stochastic optimization routine. The results are good. The tuned model accurately reproduces the measured growth of the sand waves. The differences between the measured weave heights and the model results are smaller than the measurement noise. Furthermore, the resulting parameters are surprisingly consistent, given the large variations in the sediment characteristics, the water depth and the flow field. This approach was tested on its predictive capacity using a synthetic test case. The model was tuned based on constructed predredging data and the amplitude evolution as measured for over 2 years. After tuning, the predictions were accurate for about 10 years. Thus, it is shown that the approach could be a useful tool in the optimization of dredging strategies in case of dredging of sand waves...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{sediment}} waves is reviewed and clarifications are proposed for nomenclature con-cerning vertical channel responses to large fluvial sediment fluxes {{over a period}} of a decade or longer. Gilbert’s (1917) original sediment waves are re-evaluated at their type locale and used to develop a consistent set of definitions. A ‘sediment wave ’ represents a transient sediment flux that includes but is not necessarily identical to a ‘channel bed wave ’ that represents {{the rise and fall of}} the bed in response to sedimentation. A large-scale sediment wave results when a major sediment-delivery event generates an aggradation–degradation episode (ADE). It may leave a legacy of sedi-ment deposited on valley bottoms. Gilbert’s classic sediment-wave model was empirically based on changes in bed elevations but was described as a sediment flux. He described downstream transla-tion of an attenuating symmetrical wave although it was too large and disjointed to have a coher-ent waveform. Rapid return of bed elevations to pre-sedimentation levels in Gilbert’s wave should not be mistaken for exhaustion of sediment. The common concept of a symmetrical sedi-ment wave representing the time series of sediment loads is not accurate for large-scale sedimenta-tion events that store and slowly release sediment on floodplains. Large sediment waves composed of relatively fine material and limited bed armoring tend to be right-skewed owing to rapid verti-cal readjustments relative to lateral recruitment of stored sediment. A revised right-skewed conceptual model of large sediment and <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> is presented that fits modern observations and incorporates stochastic elements of flood events. Large sediment waves may be linked to legacy sediment; that is large repositories of anthropogenic alluvium stored on valley bottom floodplains, wetlands, mill ponds, and reservoirs. This illustrates the ubiquity and importance of secular sedi-ment waves to river management...|$|E
40|$|Transient <b>bed</b> {{sediment}} <b>waves</b> in alluvial rivers {{have been}} described using a multitude of hydraulic formulations. These formulations are based on some form of the St. Venant equations and conservation of mass of sediment in suspension and in bed.

These formulations in the literature employ uncoupled, semicoupled, or fully coupled transport models treating the sediment waves as either hyperbolic (dynamic wave) or parabolic (diffusion wave). It is, however, hypothesized that the movement of <b>bed</b> sediment <b>waves</b> in alluvial rivers {{can be described as}} a kinematic wave.

40|$|Ephemeral streams {{are typical}} of arid and {{semi-arid}} regions. Their bed is dry {{for most of the}} time allowing direct inspection of bedforms and channel deposits architecture. However, such favourable condition is not paired by sufficient data on flow hydraulic parameters and sediment transport processes associated with them. These issues were studied in the ephemeral streams of the structural basin of Kobo characterised by a semi-arid, monsoon affected climate in northern Ethiopia. Since no flow data is available, bankfull discharge for a few of the study reaches has been obtained throught the field survey of representative cross-sections, streambed gradient and bed material grain size, with average flow velocity assessed by a few resistance equations, derived for sand bed rivers. The Froude numbers, calculated at bankfull flow for a few of the study reaches, are in agreement with the extensive occurrence of horizontal, planar lamination that is typically associated with upper plane bed and transition flow regime. Small bedforms, not prevously reported in the literature, are found and described as produced mainly by scouring rather than accretionary processes. Such bedforms are supplemental tools for the interpretation of ancient ephemeral streams deposits. A few equations to predict particle entrainment proved that large, individual boulders standing scattered on the stream bed can be transported at bankfull flow also for long distances. These outsized particles protruding on the streambed are rooted in a coarse-grained, reversely graded layer and commonly are immersed in fine sediments that do not show any flow perturbation in their vicinity. Direct inspection of the old alluvium and the modern channel deposits allow to identify a typical arrangement within a single bed consisting of a coarse core division, supporting the large boulders, underlain by a massive or reversely graded, fine gravel and sandy division and overlain by planar, horizontal laminated sand and grains. This model of division association is explained in terms of vertical distribution of shear stress and compared with hyperconcentrated flow and traction carpet models reported in the literature. This study model allows to interprete the characteristics and generating process of horizontal laminae as thin bedload sheets, in contrast with recent theories of flat asymmetrical <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> progradation at Froude numbers close to unity...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 Twenty-five gabion-type {{structures}} {{across the}} main stem and tributaries of the Siuslaw River in the Oregon Coastal Range, installed {{to expand the}} available spawning area for fish, were investigated {{for their ability to}} perform gravel control functions such as trapping bedload carried by the stream or holding gravel placed behind the structures. The merits of gravel trapping structures in the main stem Siuslaw River were found to depend largely on channel features in the reach at and above the structures. Factors favoring successful developments were: ample gravel supply, high bed roughness, wide straight reaches, and lateral stream bed slopes deflecting flood water from the structure. Among limiting factors were: the existence of pools immediately upstream of structures, deficient gravel supply, curving stream alignment, and unfavorable lateral stream bed slopes. Main stem reaches with an instantaneous peak discharge exceeding 100 cfs per foot width were found questionable for development. The controlling factors in the tributary streams were found to be approach velocities and stream features such as bedrock smoothness, approach slope, channel alignment, constrictions, lateral bed slope, plunge pools, and lengths of gravel beds. Careful placing of gravel to predetermined slopes was found not to be warranted, as the stream would rework the gravel according to local influences. Reaches where the flow was retarded without widening and reaches where high velocities occurred were found especially unfavorable for gravel stability. Flume studies with simulated gabions and full-size gravel were carried out to study incipient motion and scour from a gravel bed behind a gabion. Scour was found to take place from the upstream portion of the gravel bed, resulting in an adversely sloping bed there. Bed forms of standing-wave type, with changing wave location, were encountered when the flow was in the critical region; subsequent scour would wash the <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> out. Gravel transport from apparently stable beds subjected to very low flow strengths verified that gravel transport is a statistical phenomenon and that the threshold of motion should include time of observation as a variable. Disruption of the gravel imbrication at the bed surface was found to encourage particle movement.

40|$|The {{pulmonary}} venous systolic flow wave {{has been}} attributed both to left heart phenomena, such as left atrial relaxation and descent of the mitral annulus, and to propagation of the pulmonary artery pressure pulse through the pulmonary bed {{from the right}} ventricle. In this study we hypothesized that all waves in the pulmonary veins originate in the left heart, and that the gross wave features observed in measurements can be explained simply by wave propagation and reflection. A mathematical model of the pulmonary vein was developed; the pulmonary vein was modeled as a lossless transmission line and the pulmonary bed by a three-element lumped parameter model accounting for viscous losses, compliance, and inertia. We assumed that all pulsations originate in the left atrium (LA), the pressure in the pulmonary bed being constant. The model was validated using pulmonary vein pressure and flow recorded 1 cm proximal to the junction of the vein with the left atrium during aortocoronary bypass surgery. For a pressure drop of 6 mmHg across the pulmonary bed, we found a transit time from the left atrium to the pulmonary bed of tau approximate to 150 ms, a compliance of the pulmonary bed of C approximate to 0. 4 ml/mmHg, and an inertance of the pulmonary bed of 1. 1 mmHg s(2) /ml. The pulse wave velocity of the pulmonary vein {{was estimated to be}} c approximate to 1 m/s. Waves, however, travel both towards the left atrium and towards the pulmonary <b>bed.</b> <b>Waves</b> traveling towards the left atrium are attributed to the reflections caused by the mismatch of impedance of line (pulmonary vein) and load (pulmonary bed). Wave intensity analysis was used to identify a period in systole of net wave propagation towards the left atrium for both measurements and model. The linear separation technique was used to split the pressure into one component traveling from the left atrium to the pulmonary bed and a reflected component propagating from the pulmonary bed to the left atrium. The peak of the reflected pressure wave corresponded well with the positive peak in wave intensity in systole. We conclude that the gross features of the pressure and flow waves in the pulmonary vein can be explained in the following manner: the waves originate in the LA and travel towards the pulmonary bed, where reflections give rise to waves traveling back to the LA. Although the gross features of the measured pressure were captured well by the model predicted pressure, there was still some discrepancy between the two. Thus, other factors initiating or influencing waves traveling towards the LA cannot be excluded...|$|E

Recent theoretical, experimental and field studies examine factors influencing dispersion and translation of <b>bed</b> material <b>waves</b> in quasiuniform, gravel-bed channels.

Within these constraints, two factors influence relative rates of dispersion and translation: (1) interactions between wave topography, flow and bed load transport; and (2) particle-size differences between wave material and original bed material. Our {{results indicate that}} dispersion dominates the evolution of <b>bed</b> material <b>waves</b> in gravel-bed channels. Significant translation requires a low Froude number, which is uncharacteristic of gravel-bed channels, and low wave amplitude which, for a large wave, can be achieved only after substantial dispersion.

40|$|Tidal sand ridges are {{large-scale}} bedforms with horizontal {{dimensions of}} several kilometers and heights {{of tens of}} meters. They occur in the offshore area of shelf seas that have {{a wide range of}} water depths (10 - 200 m). Based on their present-day behavior, ridges are classified as `active' (sand transport everywhere), `quasi-active' (sand transport in parts of the ridge area) and `moribund' (sand transport nowhere). They evolve on a timescale of centuries due to tide-topography interactions and they are shaped by wind waves. During their evolution, ridges are also affected by changes in sea level, strength and direction of the tidal current. A literature survey resulted in three research questions on the dynamics of thsee ridges. The first one concerns the effect of different formulations of bed shear stress and sand transport on the growth characteristics of these bedforms (growth rate and wavelength). The second one is on the sensitivity of the characteristics of finite-height ridges (their shape and growth time) to either 1 D or 2 D configurations (topography varies in one/two horizontal dimensions). The third one concerns the effect of changes in the characteristics of the sea level and the tidal current on the long-term evolution of these ridges. An idealized nonlinear morphodynamic model was developed and used for the above questions. Main findings are listed below. Regarding the initial formation of tidal sand ridges, the formulations for bed shear stress and slope-induced sand transport are not critical. For these ridges, under rectilinear tidal currents, increasing the critical velocity for sand erosion decreases the growth rate and the wavelength of the preferred bedform significantly. Besides tidal sand ridges, long <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> are also found if the critical velocity for sand erosion is slightly smaller than the tidal current amplitude. For the nonlinear evolution of tidal sand ridges, neglecting changes in the sea level and tidal conditions, {{in the case of a}} 1 D configuration, the root mean square height hrms of ridges first grows exponentially and hereafter saturates. In the end, ridges in static equilibrium are obtained, i. e., hrms remains constant. In contrast, when the configuration is 2 D, ridges are found with spatially meandering crests that oscillate in time. Initially the bedforms are composed of a finite number of bottom modes. The occurrence of the meanders relates to the presence of bottom modes with crests normal to those of the initially preferred bedform. If changes in the sea level and tidal conditions are accounted for, with increasing rates of sea level rise, for active tidal sand ridges, their growth time becomes longer, and hrms keeps on increasing. On the considered time scale (10000 years), assuming a constant wave climate, quasi-active ridges occur mainly as a result of a decreasing tidal current amplitude such that the effective velocity (in the sense of stirring sand) becomes smaller than the critical velocity for sand erosion. The ridges further become moribund on a time scale that depends inversely on the rate of sea level rise...|$|E
40|$|Submarine {{sediment}} density flows {{are one of}} {{the most}} important processes for moving sediment across our planet, yet they are extremely difficult to monitor directly. The speed of long run-out submarine density flows has been measured directly in just five locations worldwide and their sediment concentration has never been measured directly. The only record of most density flows is their sediment deposit. This article summarizes the processes by which density flows deposit sediment and proposes a new single classification for the resulting types of deposit. Colloidal properties of fine cohesive mud ensure that mud deposition is complex, and large volumes of mud can sometimes pond or drain-back for long distances into basinal lows. Deposition of ungraded mud (TE- 3) most probably finally results from en masse consolidation in relatively thin and dense flows, although initial size sorting of mud indicates earlier stages of dilute and expanded flow. Graded mud (TE- 2) and finely laminated mud (TE- 1) most probably result from floc settling at lower mud concentrations. Grain-size breaks beneath mud intervals are commonplace, and record bypass of intermediate grain sizes due to colloidal mud behaviour. Planar-laminated (TD) and ripple cross-laminated (TC) non-cohesive silt or fine sand is deposited by dilute flow, and the external deposit shape is consistent with previous models of spatial decelerating (dissipative) dilute flow. A grain-size break beneath the ripple cross-laminated (TC) interval is common, and records a period of sediment reworking (sometimes into dunes) or bypass. Finely planar-laminated sand can be deposited by low-amplitude <b>bed</b> <b>waves</b> in dilute flow (TB- 1), but it is most likely to be deposited mainly by high-concentration near-bed layers beneath high-density flows (TB- 2). More widely spaced planar lamination (TB- 3) occurs beneath massive clean sand (TA), and is also formed by high-density turbidity currents. High-density turbidite deposits (TA, TB- 2 and TB- 3) have a tabular shape consistent with hindered settling, and are typically overlain by a more extensive drape of low-density turbidite (TD and TC,). This core and drape shape suggests that events sometimes comprise two distinct flow components. Massive clean sand is less commonly deposited en masse by liquefied debris flow (DCS), in which case the clean sand is ungraded or has a patchy grain-size texture. Clean-sand debrites can extend for several tens of kilometres before pinching out abruptly. Up-current transitions suggest that clean-sand debris flows sometimes form via transformation from high-density turbidity currents. Cohesive debris flows can deposit three types of ungraded muddy sand that may contain clasts. Thick cohesive debrites tend to occur in more proximal settings and extend from an initial slope failure. Thinner and highly mobile low-strength cohesive debris flows produce extensive deposits restricted to distal areas. These low-strength debris flows may contain clasts and travel long distances (DM- 2), or result from more local flow transformation due to turbulence damping by cohesive mud (DM- 1). Mapping of individual flow deposits (beds) emphasizes how a single event can contain several flow types, with transformations between flow types. Flow transformation may be from dilute to dense flow, as well as from dense to dilute flow. Flow state, deposit type and flow transformation are strongly dependent on the volume fraction of cohesive fine mud within a flow. Recent field observations show significant deviations from previous widely cited models, and many hypotheses linking flow type to deposit type are poorly tested. There is much still to learn about these remarkable flows...|$|E

Both a permeable (under Darcy's law) and an impermeable beach are considered. It is found that alongshore-periodic morphological features reminiscent of swash beach cusps form after a number of incident wave periods on both beaches. On the permeable (impermeable) beach these patterns are accretional (erosional). In both cases flow is ‘horn divergent’. Spacings of the cusps are consistent with observations, and are close to those provided by a standing synchronous linear edge wave. An analysis of the processes leading to bed change is presented.

It points out con-straints on the inferences that can be made about sediment loads based on changes in channel-bed elevation at this scale where channel sediment interacts with storage in floodplain and terrace deposits. The type area of G. K. Gilbert’s initial sediment-wave concept is re-examined to show that neither wave translation nor dispersion occurred in the simple manner commonly assumed. Channel aggradation and return to graded conditions provide an alternative theory explaining Gilbert’s observed bed-elevation changes. Recognizing the evidence and implications of the former passage of a large-scale <b>bed</b> <b>wave</b> is essential to the accurate diagnosis of catchment conditions and the adoption of appropriate river restoration goals or methods. Sediment loads, water quality, channel morphologic stability and aquatic ecosystems often reflect changes in sediment storage long after the channel bed has returne...|$|R

And the comparison with many studies by various authors and these experimentsgives the following results. The Kennedy's equation is the most good agreement with experimental data for thewave length. The propagation velocity obtained by Kennedy, Gradowczyk and the author,which are analyzed by each different methods give the same results and these show agood agreement with measured one. And the analytical result by the author for the waveheight of the <b>bed</b> <b>wave</b> can be used for all flow regimes with sufficient accuracy. The author's experiments show that the effect of the grain-size is very remarkable forthe occurrence of anti-dunes and the region of the flat bed is wider as increase of the graindiamenter of bed materials. Though it made to he possible to predict the geometricalproperties of sand waves from the mean flow parameters with sufficient accuracy, all theoriesreported up to this time can not systematically explain the mechanism of the occurrenceof various bed configurations including the effect of the grain-size with the clear physicalhack ground. And it will he required the further studies...|$|R

The set of acoustic instrumentation consisted of an Acoustic 3 D Ripple Profiler (3 D-ARP), a novel Bedform And Suspended Sediment Imager (BASSI) and three Acoustic Concentration and Velocity Profilers (ACVP).

40|$|A {{field study}} of {{cohesive}} sediment movements on a muddy intertidal zone (ITZ) at Portishead, Severn Estuary is presented. Five deployments of 1 - 3 days {{have been made}} to improve the understanding of temporal and spatial variations in suspended and bed sediments at a site which is found to be wave dominated. Pressure transducers, electro-magnetic current meters, optical turbidity meters and ultra-sonic bed level transducers are used to monitor the hydro/sediment dynamics in the bottom metre of the water column at two points on the ITZ. A one-dimensional (vertical) k-ϵ turbulence model has been modified to include bed sediment exchange and density stratification to enable further interpretation of field data. Modelling results show that the weak current on the ITZ would simply provide a mechanism for diffusing suspended sediment into {{the upper part of the}} flow, and does not enhance the wave boundary layer by its presence and cannot actively support suspended sediment. Hence near <b>bed</b> (<b>wave</b> generated) turbulence controls the vertical SSC distribution. A bed model based on bed sediment exchange via critical erosional and depositional shear stresses only predicts high near bed concentrations for some of the hydrodynamic conditions reflected in field data, suggesting hindered settling is an important factor in their formation. The introduction of density stratification reduces near surface SSC creating steeper SSC gradients in the upper half of the flow, for a weak current with waves...|$|R
40|$|Scaling {{designs for}} mobile <b>bed</b> short <b>wave</b> {{experiments}} have been analysed using {{a suite of}} numerical models to test different sediment scaling configurations. The numerical simulations have revealed that geometrical sediment scaling gives similarity in the boundary layer flow but the sediment transport mode switches from bedload in the prototype to suspended-load in the model. This {{is due to the}} high relation of prototype to model sediment sizes. However, scaling to maintain the relative fall speed allows smaller sediment size relations and closer similarity in the dominant transport processes. A set of corrections have been proposed to minimise the scaling effects in sediment transport rates and bottom evolution...|$|R
40|$|Patterns of wave amplitudes, {{linear flow}} velocity, turbidity, {{sedimentation}} and periphyton accumulation were quantified across two macrophyte beds of contrasting architecture and adjacent unvegetated sediments, in Lake Veluwe, The Netherlands. Within both a Chara aspera- and an Alisma gramineum-dominated <b>bed,</b> <b>wave</b> amplitudes were progressively reduced. Vertical profiles of linear velocity {{in the two}} vegetations were significantly {{different from each other}} and from profiles measured outside the vegetation. Compared to unvegetated profiles, flow over the Chara-bed was more rapid in the upper 20 cm of the water but then dropped rapidly. In Alisma, maximum velocity at the surface was already lower than outside the vegetation. The denser Alisma-bed had a higher biomass (125 +/- 15 g AFDW m(- 2), mean +/- standard error) than the Chara-bed (28 +/- 1), it filled the whole water column, and rapidly reduced light attenuation (K-d) from 6. 4 +/- 1. 4 outside to 2. 3 +/- 0. 3 m(- 1) within the vegetation. Also in the Chara-bed, light attenuation and sedimentation rates were significantly reduced (light attenuation: 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 versus 2. 7 +/- 0. 1 m(- 1); sedimentation: 2. 6 +/- 0. 3 versus 7. 7 +/- 0. 5 mg dry weight cm(- 2) d(- 1), averaged over the growing season). The dense Chara vegetation of 10 - 20 cm height effectively lifted the resuspensive turbulent shear stress above the sediment surface, thereby trapping settled material.

40|$|AbstractThis {{study is}} {{motivated}} by recognition of complex sandbar evolution patterns under wave actions inside the surf zone. A series of physical model experiments were conducted in a wave flume to investigate sandbar migration under various wave conditions, including wave groups, regular waves, and random waves. It was observed that under certain wave conditions sandbars move alternately shoreward and seaward rather than continuously in the same direction. The measurements show that the unstable movement of sandbars {{is closely related to}} the amplitude modulation of waves. Smaller amplitude modulation tends to produce more intense unstable bar movements. Data analysis further shows that the sandbar migration {{does not seem to be}} a passive response of the sea <b>bed</b> to <b>wave</b> forcing, but is most likely caused by the feedback interaction between <b>waves</b> and <b>bed</b> topography...|$|R
