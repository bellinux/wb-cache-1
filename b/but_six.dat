5|$|An early {{estimate}} by the Small Business Administration put total {{damage in}} Gilroy {{at twice the}} amount of what was seen in Hollister. Ten people were brought to Hazel Hawkins Memorial Hospital in Hollister for treatment of lacerations, a cardiac problem, and anxiety. In Gilroy, the Wheeler Hospital saw six similar cases and a patient with a fractured hip. Most of those that sought care (including four that were transported by ambulance) were treated and released, <b>but</b> <b>six</b> were admitted.|$|E

Jefferson also displaced two district judgesRay Greene and Jacob Readciting technical {{flaws in}} their appointments. Further, District Judge John Pickering was impeached and {{removed from office}} on a party-line vote. The following day, the House impeached Justice Samuel Chase, <b>but</b> <b>six</b> Democratic-Republicans crossed party lines in the Senate to prevent his conviction by a single vote.|$|E
5|$|Steering {{currents}} remained weak {{giving the}} storm {{a chance to}} fully re-develop its deep convection while immobile at sea. During this time, Tropical Storm Gordon began to spawn tornadoes. As the storm center was well offshore most were probably unreported, <b>but</b> <b>six</b> tornadoes touched down on the Florida coast. Four of the tornadoes were rated F0 on the Fujita scale, two were rated F1, and one was given an F2 rating with estimated wind speeds of 113ndash&157 mph (181ndash&253 km/h).|$|E
5|$|Wilhelm Lemke (27 September 1920 – 4 December 1943) was a German {{fighter pilot}} during World War II. A flying ace, Lemke was {{credited}} with 131 aerial victories—that is, 131 aerial combat encounters resulting {{in the destruction of}} the enemy aircraft. All <b>but</b> <b>six</b> of his victories were claimed over the Soviet Air Forces in 617 combat missions.|$|E

Of his remaining nine victories, five were achieved with Ford powered cars, and four with Renault. He was most successful at Monaco, where he won six times during his career, including a record five consecutive times between 1989 and 1993. His largest {{margin of victory}} was 1:23.199 at the 1993 European Grand Prix, while the narrowest margin was at the 1986 Spanish Grand Prix, when he beat Nigel Mansell by 0.014 seconds, one of the closest finishes in Formula One.|$|E
5|$|Anne Hyde (12 March 163731 March 1671) was Duchess of York and of Albany as {{the first}} wife of the future King James II of England. Originally an Anglican, she {{converted}} to Catholicism soon after her marriage to James. This took place in 1660 after she became pregnant by him, but {{he is said to}} have promised to marry her the year before. The two first met in the Netherlands while Anne was living in the household of James' sister Mary. James and Anne had eight children, <b>but</b> <b>six</b> died in early childhood. The two who survived to adulthood were Mary, who succeeded her father after his deposition during the Glorious Revolution of 1688, and Anne, who succeeded her brother-in-law and became the first monarch of Great Britain.|$|E
5|$|Delays in {{shipping}} Spitfires to Australia disrupted No.1 Wing's formation. In late June 1942 the British Government diverted all <b>but</b> <b>six</b> of {{the initial}} 48 aircraft to Egypt to reinforce the three RAF Spitfire squadrons there after the German victory in the Battle of Gazala; most of these aircraft were allocated to No. 92 Squadron RAF with the remainder forming a reserve to replace future losses. The Australian Government protested against this action, but reluctantly accepted it after Churchill refused to counteract the diversion. During the same period, {{the men of the}} three Spitfire squadrons sailed from Liverpool on board the MV Stirling Castle on 21June and disembarked at Melbourne with the six remaining Spitfires on 13August. A shipment of 43 Spitfires left England on 4 August and arrived in Australia in late October, and further deliveries continued to be made until June 1945.|$|E

5|$|Frustrated at {{negotiations}} with the Republic and believing it weakened by both the Darul Islam and Madiun insurgencies, the Dutch launched a military offensive on 19 December 1948 which it termed 'Operatie Kraai' (Operation Crow). By the following day it had conquered the city of Yogyakarta, {{the location of the}} temporary Republican capital. By the end of December, all major Republican held cities in Java and Sumatra were in Dutch hands. The Republican President, Vice-President, and all <b>but</b> <b>six</b> Republic of Indonesia ministers were captured by Dutch troops and exiled on Bangka Island off the east coast of Sumatra. In areas surrounding Yogyakarta and Surakarta, Republican forces refused to surrender and continued to wage a guerrilla war under the leadership of Republican military chief of staff General Sudirman who had escaped the Dutch offensives. An emergency Republican government, the Pemerintahan Darurat Republik Indonesia (PDRI), was established in West Sumatra.|$|E
5|$|Some of the 69 known {{satellites}} of Jupiter {{are considered}} lost {{because they have}} not been observed since their discovery and hence their orbits are not well-known enough to pinpoint their current locations. Work has been done to recover many of them in surveys from 2009 onwards (in which some new moons were also discovered), <b>but</b> <b>six</b> – S/2003 J 12, S/2003 J 10, S/2003 J 19, S/2003 J 4, S/2003 J 2, and S/2011 J 1 – still remain lost today. Follow-up observations in 2018 are planned to secure their orbits and perhaps find new moons.|$|E
5|$|The BBC Film Library {{was turned}} into a {{combined}} Film & Videotape Library for the preservation of both media. The Film Library at the time held only 47 episodes of 1960s Doctor Who; they had once held 53, <b>but</b> <b>six</b> episodes had either been junked or gone missing. Junkings at BBC Enterprises, however, continued until the intervention of Ian Levine, a record producer and fan of the programme. Following the transfer of episodes still held by Enterprises, there were 152 episodes of Doctor Who no longer held by the BBC, although subsequent efforts have reduced that number to 97.|$|E

5|$|The Dutch Infantry used about 2,200 7.92mm Schwarzlose M.08 machine guns, partly licence produced, {{and eight}} hundred Vickers machine guns. Many {{of these were}} fitted in the pillboxes; each {{battalion}} had a heavy machine gun company of twelve. The Dutch infantry squads were equipped with an organic light machine gun, the M.20 Lewis machine gun, of which about eight thousand were available. This weapon was prone to jamming and not very suitable for offensive operations. Most Dutch infantry were equipped with the Dutch Mannlicher rifle, {{a variant of the}} Mannlicher M1893. This weapon had been in service with the Dutch military for over 40 years and its obsolescence had become obvious, but the Dutch military did not have the money to replace it. There were <b>but</b> <b>six</b> 80mm mortars for each regiment. This lack of firepower seriously impaired the fighting performance of the Dutch infantry.|$|E

Four of these also contain areas north of the Gadsden Purchase, but these areas do have low population densities, with the exception of northeastern Pinal County, Arizona, including the towns of Apache Junction and Florence. Maricopa County also extends south into the area of the Gadsden Purchase, but this area is also thinly populated. Tucson is the largest city in the Gadsden Purchase.|$|E
5|$|The storm {{produced}} rough surf {{along the}} coastline from Florida to North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. In some areas, the waves eroded up to 20feet (6m) of beach, leaving 70homes {{in danger of}} collapse. Offshore North Carolina, high waves of 34feet (10m) and tropical-storm-force winds damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard, although all nine sustained injuries. Light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations. Damage was minimal, <b>but</b> <b>six</b> people drowned {{as a result of}} the storm.|$|E

5|$|Soon {{after the}} news of this public tragedy reached Athens, a massive {{controversy}} erupted over the apportionment of blame for the botched rescue. The public was furious {{over the loss of}} so many sailors, and over the failure to recover the bodies of the dead for burial, and the generals suspected that Thrasybulus and Theramenes, who had already returned to Athens, might have been responsible for stirring up the assembly against them, and wrote letters to the people denouncing the two trierarchs as responsible for the failed rescue. Thrasybulus and Theramenes were called before the assembly to defend their behavior; in their defense, Theramenes produced a letter from the generals in which they blamed only the storm for the mishap; the trierarchs were exonerated, and public anger now turned against the generals. All eight were deposed from office, and summoned back to Athens to stand trial. Two fled, <b>but</b> <b>six</b> returned as commanded to face the charges against them.|$|E
