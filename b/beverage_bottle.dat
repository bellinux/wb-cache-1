40|$|An {{increasing}} number of companies are exploring ways to improve their environmental footprint. Some environmental benefits are offered by bio-based plastic packaging; however, this approach requires trade-offs. For example, plastic bottles made with polylactic acid (PLA), a bio-based plastic resin, lack the impact strength offered by plastic bottles made with polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Other trade-offs include diminished shelf life capabilities, increased cost, and recycling infrastructure. In particular, displacement of recyclable plastic packaging with plastics made from renewable resources has created controversy among environmental advocates. Despite its performance, cost, and recycling shortcomings, PLA offers an attractive choice to some because it represents the transition towards use of renewable resources. In an attempt to address trade-offs, I developed an analytical framework with assistance from key stakeholders. After identifying the fundamental objective of the best choice of resin for the manufacture of plastic bottles, I surveyed stakeholders to create a list of essential packaging criteria, with the three major criteria being performance as a bottle material, cost, and environmental impact. I relied on private interviews with industry experts and conference presentations to gather bottle data for four resins: PLA, PET, high density polyethylene (HDPE) and polypropylene (PP). The framework for comparison was Multiattribute Utility Theory (MAUT), a methodology designed to address trade-offs among multiple objectives to achieve an overall objective. Based on the survey results and best available data as input for MAUT, PET was the best choice of resin for the <b>beverage</b> <b>bottle.</b> This non-bio-based plastic emerged as the top choice largely due to its superior performance on criteria such as strength and shelf life. Further analysis {{of the characteristics of}} the four plastics showed that even if all environmental and cost characteristics of the bio-based plastic, PLA, were as favorable as any of the other plastics I analyzed, PLA still would not come to the top. Only if PLA’s performance as a bottle material (strength, etc.) increased several fold would PLA become the top choice among the four I analyzed. Similarly, analysis of the weighting of the criteria showed that increasing the weights on environmental criteria, compared to performance and cost criteria, cannot elevate PLA to the top choice, mainly because HDPE has desirable environmental characteristics such as recyclability. Only increasing the weight on environmental criteria such as greenhouse gas emissions while decreasing the weight on all other environmental criteria would allow PLA to become the top choice among the four bottle materials I analyzed...|$|E
40|$|Deforestation {{and forest}} {{degradation}} {{is a global}} issue, especially in poor and developing regions of the world. In order to combat deforestation {{it is critical to}} enhance the productivity of forest restoration operations, which often involve planting of nursery-grown forest tree seedlings. Production of low quality stock types with deformed and spiraled root systems is a significant issue hindering successful restoration programs. Polybags (i. e., small plastic bags) are a common container type for seedling propagation in developing countries. However, polybags produce seedlings with spiraled and deformed root systems that reduce outplanting survival and performance. Use of discarded plastic water bottles could be a feasible alternative as a container type for seedling propagation in restoration programs. The overall objective {{of this study was to}} develop technology for repurposing discarded plastic beverage bottles to grow quality native plants, trees and shrubs to benefit agroforestry, reforestation, restoration, and conservation programs. Specific objectives for this study were accomplished in two separate experiments (CHAPTER 2) : 1) Container Comparison Experiment - to compare root and shoot development of seedlings grown in plastic bottles, modern nursery containers, and polybags; and 2) Bottle Modification Experiment - to examine the effects of root spiraling control techniques and container opacity on seedling morphological attributes. ^ In the Container Comparison experiment, seedlings of two species, Afghan pine (Pinus eldarica Medw.) and Arizona walnut (Juglans major [Toor. ] Heller), were grown in four container types; Coca-Cola® <b>beverage</b> <b>bottle</b> (Coke), modern container Deepot™ D 27 (D 27), Polyethylene polybag (polybag), and Sam 2 ̆ 7 s Club® water bottle (Sams). At the first sampling period in August, Arizona walnut seedling shoot height, shoot dry biomass, and root dry biomass were all significantly greater in D 27 containers compared to Coke bottles and polybags, while Sams bottles did not differ among treatments. Afghan pine seedling shoot height was significantly greater for seedlings grown in the Sams bottles compared to polybags, while Coke bottles and D 27 did not differ among treatments. Root fibrosity was greater for seedlings grown in both Coke and Sams bottles compared to D 27 and polybags. Similarly, the number of lateral roots was greater in Coke bottles compared to D 27 and polybag containers. At the final measurement period (November), significant differences among treatments were found for all root morphological responses; for both species, seedlings grown in plastic bottles and modern containers had significantly less spiraled roots compared to the polybag. Seedling shoot and root development in plastic bottles at the end of the growing season was equal to or greater than that of the modern container. First year field height and diameter of Arizona walnut and Afghan pine were similar among containers. Similarly, first year field survival of both species was not affected by container type and was 100...|$|E
40|$|Department of Creative Design EngineeringIdentifying and {{exploiting}} local specialties {{are effective}} and useful strategies for local development. In Korea, the government promotes local industry, {{and developing a}} local specialty {{is a part of}} this. A specialty product not only improves local industry from an economic standpoint but also increases the design of cultural contents. One company called Boksoondoga has a certificated field specialty as an alcoholic beverage brand in Ulju-gun, Ulsan. Moreover, the company’s representative product rice wine is a kind of brewed rice wine of traditional Korea. This product earned local-specialty-wine approval from the ministry of agriculture and forestry in 2010. Boksoondoga rice wine could not be produced in large quantities due to the traditional brewing method of achieving natural fermentation by using local newly harvested rice and malt instead of using preservative and artificial yeast. This product is so unique because of its naturally occurring carbonic acid. It is refreshing like champagne and offers a deep, smooth flavor. Moreover, contrary to other brewed rice wines, it can be blended naturally even though it cannot be shaken when opened. A company has several national ongoing projects, not just focusing on a representative product but also using its brand value to engage in storytelling in the cottage industry rather than just concentrating on mass production in the factory setting. A company with such a characteristic faces the disadvantage {{that it is difficult to}} use mass production and large-scale marketing methods, unlike the situation facing other competitors in the same product line. However, it has the advantage of expanding and challenging its business, with there being a high degree of freedom regarding risk. Boksoondoga wants to bring a high-class touch to making rice wine, one of the traditional wines, the representative drink of Korea, like Japanese sake. Making the appearance of the bottle distinctly different from those of other companies' products is also part of this goal. The initiative, which began six years ago, has been spectacularly successful and has more capacity than do those of the company’s competitors. Its relatively high-priced sales method has also provoked a positive response from consumers. 	 Currently, trends in the domestic alcohol-consumption market have become more accessiblethe age group of consumers has been lowered, and the distribution channel for alcohol is widening. Efforts have been made to bring Korean traditional alcohol to all consumers, not just the enthusiasts who enjoy the drink. Boksoondoga likewise is looking for a way in which to appeal to consumers who are more luxurious. This includes doing marketing, doing research and development, and upgrading existing products. The project aim with this specialized company is to suggest the possibility, from various points of view, of making the core product a representative one of Korea. However, it could be insufficient in the expansion of the business. There have previously been no quantitative data based on respondents in various fields because of the cottage industry situation. In this study, however, we had to enhance the reliability by using systematic market analysis to test parallel products and the sufficient samples of participants for meaningful results. The participants’ responses reflect their views of the prototypes (stimuli). As a result, the findings are expected to help the company to know what to concentrate on and how to lower its risk of failure during the expansion of the business. They will also increase the stability of the existing business base at the same time. In conclusion, the design outcome of this project involves a new product line based on design and engineering knowledge centering on the brand value that the company pursues, the product market trend, future possibilities, and problem solving. Along with introducing a low-volume <b>beverage</b> <b>bottle</b> that more consumers can access, I introduce a solution involving a new design of the lid part together with a solution to the overflow problem caused by carbonic acid leaks. In comparison with existing products, the patent application is under way to increase the possibility of expansion. I think this will be possible due to contributing to schools, the company, and industry. 지역 특산품을 개발하고 찾아내는 것은 지역 발전에 효과적이고 적절한 전략이다. 한국정부는 지역 산업을 지원하고 홍보하는 과제들이 많으며, 지역 특산품 개발은 그 일환이라고 할 수 있다. 이런 특산품들은 경제적인 측면에서 지역산업을 향상시킬 뿐만 아니라 문화적인 컨텐츠 디자인에도 한 몫을 한다. 울산광역시 울주군에는 이런 보증된 특산품 중 주류 브랜드인 ‘복순도가’가 있다. 복순도가는 대표적인 제품으로 쌀로 만든 누룩으로 빚는 술인 전통주의 하나, 막거리를 생산한다. 이 제품은 2010 년 한국 농림축산식품부로부터 지역 특산주로 승인 받았다. 복순도가의 막걸리는 전통적인 방법으로 술을 빚어 하루에 많은 양을 생산하지 않고, 지역의 햅쌀을 이용해 인공적이고 화학적인 재료로 만든 누룩이 아닌 천연 누룩으로 생성된 자연 발효된 탄산가스를 함유하고 있다. 다른 회사의 같은 제품들과의 큰 차이점이라면 제품 공정 중에 탄산이 주입되어 밀봉된 것이 아닌, 시간이 지나면서 병 아래쪽에 가라앉은 누룩이 천연 탄산을 생성한다는 점이다. 이렇게 만들어진 청량한 느낌의 탄산 가스는 샴페인처럼 부드럽고 깊은 맛을 만든다. 게다가 이 탄산 가스는 천천히 음료 속에 함유되어 타 제품들과 같이 음용 전 흔들지 않아도 자연스럽게 올라오면서 섞이게 한다. 복순도가는 현재 여러가지 국가과제를 진행하고 있으며, 대표제품에만 집중하는 것이 아닌 그들이 가지고 있는 브랜드 가치를 개발하고 사회에 공헌하는 것에 힘쓰고 있다. 이렇듯 특징적인 제품을 가진 회사는 같은 제품라인 경쟁사들과 달리 대량생산, 대규모의 마케팅 방법을 사용하기 어렵다는 단점을 가지고 있다. 하지만 달리 생각하면 사업의 확장과 도전, 리스크적인 면에서는 자유도가 높다는 장점이 있다. 복순도가는 전통주의 하나이면서 대중적인 막걸리를 일본의 사케와 같이 한국의 대표적인 술로 만들고 싶다는 목표와 함께, 고급적인 면을 담아내고 싶어한다. 다른 회사들의 제품과 확연하게 다른 병의 외양 또한 이 같은 목표의 일환이라고 할 수 있다. 6 년 전에 시작했던 이 시도는 보기 좋게 성공했으며, 경쟁사들에 비해 많은 용량을 담고, 상대적으로 높은 가격의 판매방식 또한 소비자들에게 긍정적인 반응을 불러일으켰다. 현재 국내 술 소비시장의 트렌드는 소비자의 연령층이 낮아지고, 술의 유통채널이 넓어지면서 접근성이 높아졌다. 대대로 내려오는 전통주들은 매니아들만이 즐기는 음료가 아닌 대중들에게 가까워지려는 시도를 하고 있다. 이에 복순도가도 마찬가지로 더 질 좋은, 고급스러운, 소비자에게 어필할 수 있는 방법을 찾고 있다. 이것을 위해서는 마케팅, 연구 및 개발, 기존 제품의 향상 등 여러가지 방법이 있다. 석사 졸업과제의 프로젝트로 진행하는 이 연구의 목적은 이 특별한 회사에게 다양한 측면에서의 핵심 제품을 활용한 가능성들을 제안해주는 것이다. 그리고 이것은 회사의 사업 확장에서의 부족한 면들을 보조해줄 수 있을 거라 생각한다. 회사는 작은 규모 회사의 특성상 여러 영역의 수적인 응답을 통한 정량적인 데이터를 분석하는 것이 쉽지 않았을 것이며, 이에 나는 충분한 양의 사용자 응답과 체계적인 시장 분석으로 신뢰성 있는 결과를 주고자 했다. 그리고 이 결과들은 유형의 프로토타입에 반영되어 연구실 규모의 실험 과정 및 결과를 거쳐 효용성과 가능성을 검증하는데 쓰였다. 결론적으로는 이 프로젝트의 디자인 아웃컴은 회사가 추구하는 브랜드 가치와, 제품 시장 트렌드, 앞으로의 가능성, 현재 가진 문제점 해결 등을 중심으로 디자인과 공학적 지식을 바탕으로 새로운 제품라인을 제시한다. 더 많은 소비자들이 접할 수 있는 낮은 용량의 음료병과 함께 탄산 과다누출로 인한 넘치는 문제를 lid 부분의 새로운 설계와 함께 개방 방법을 제공해주는 솔루션을 도입하였다. 실제 기존 제품과의 비교를 통해 확장 가능성을 높이 사 특허출원을 진행 중이며, 이는 학교와 회사 그리고 산업 영역에 공헌하는 결과물이 될 것이라 생각한다. ope...|$|E
