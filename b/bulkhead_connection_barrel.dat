40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} the tests performed on a full-size motorboat {{to demonstrate the}} potential for adhesive bonding to replace overlaminated connections. Adhesive bonding resulted in {{a significant reduction in}} assembly time for <b>bulkhead</b> <b>connections</b> compared with overlamination. Drop tests and sea trials were performed using specially adapted strain gauge instrumentation. These indicated low adhesive joint strain levels, even for severe test conditions. No damage was observed. The data obtained will be used to improve laboratory test procedures to simulate service loading of boat structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} between column and deck-box on a semi submersible platform is often subjected to high stress concentrations {{that can be}} governing for the structural strength. One common design used to withstand the high stresses is a cast integral in high tensile material, which is both heavy and expensive to manufacture, which is why an alternative cut-out design is investigated. This study presents an analysis of a node connection with regard to yield stresses, buckling, fatigue damage, weight and cost in order to propose an alternative cut-out design using the same criteria. The cast integral, which is analysed as a reference case and used for comparison of designs, is of a typical design used today. A parametric study shows {{that the use of}} a cut-out design may be advantageous in the centre <b>bulkhead</b> <b>connection</b> between the column and the deck-box. The adjacent geometry is of simple character and the cut-out does not affect the overall structural design. The cut-out is found to be a feasible alternative to the cast integral, with yield stresses and fatigue damage in the same range. Further refinements of the cut-out design could, however, decrease both yield stresses and fatigue damage. A suggested cut-out solution leads to a decrease of 4. 5 % in weight for a reference structure. For the same reference structure the production cost is estimated to decrease by 9 %, hence, the cut-out design is recommended for the centre <b>bulkhead</b> <b>connection...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{connection}} between column and deck-box on a semi-submersible platform is often subjected to high stress concentrations {{that can be}} governing for the structural strength. One common design used to withstand the high stresses is a cast integral in high tensile material, which is both heavy and expensive to manufacture, which is why an alternative cut-out design is investigated. This thesis aims at analysing the current node connection, with a finite element analysis (FEA), with regard to yield stresses, buckling, fatigue damage, weight and cost in order to propose an alternative cut-out design using the same criteria. The cast integral, which is analysed as a reference case and used for comparison of designs, is of a typical design used by GVA Consultants AB. The alternative cut-out design is first studied in a simplified two-dimensional (2 D) case, developed with applied loads and boundary conditions following recommendations from the classification society DNV-GL. Different geometrical cut-out shapes used in other applications are tested and evaluated. The cut-out design with the lowest yield stresses is implemented and further evaluated in {{a case study of}} a complete semisubmersible production platform. The cut-out design is investigated with a parametric study for the complete loading condition, which is defined from previous calculations performed by GVA. The cut-out is analysed with both the simplified fatigue assessment and with a stochastic approach, in order to investigate differences and inaccuracies in the methods. The parametric study shows that the use of a cut-out design may be advantageous in the centre <b>bulkhead</b> <b>connection</b> between the column and the deck-box. The adjacent geometry is of simple character and the cut-out does not affect the overall structural design. The cut-out is found to be a feasible alternative to the cast integral, with yield stresses and fatigue damage in the same range. Further refinements of the cut-out design could, however, decrease both yield stresses and fatigue damage, which is why the cutout is recommended in future work. The suggested cut-out solution leads to a decrease of 4. 5 % in weight for a reference structure. For the same reference structure the production cost is estimated to decrease by 9. 5 %, hence, the cut-out design is recommended for the centre <b>bulkhead</b> <b>connection.</b> However, it is concluded that the cut-out design is only developed for one specific semisubmersible platform in specific load conditions, for which reason further analysis and adjustments are needed for other applications and structures...|$|R
40|$|SummaryIn the rodent vibrissal system, active {{sensation}} and sensorimotor integration are mediated {{in part by}} <b>connections</b> between <b>barrel</b> cortex and vibrissal motor cortex. Little {{is known}} about how these structures interact {{at the level of}} neurons. We used Channelrhodopsin- 2 (ChR 2) expression, combined with anterograde and retrograde labeling, to map <b>connections</b> between <b>barrel</b> cortex and pyramidal neurons in mouse motor cortex. Barrel cortex axons preferentially targeted upper layer (L 2 / 3, L 5 A) neurons in motor cortex; input to neurons projecting back to barrel cortex was particularly strong. Barrel cortex input to deeper layers (L 5 B, L 6) of motor cortex, including neurons projecting to the brainstem, was weak, despite pronounced geometric overlap of dendrites with axons from barrel cortex. Neurons in different layers received barrel cortex input within stereotyped dendritic domains. The cortico-cortical neurons in superficial layers of motor cortex thus couple motor and sensory signals and might mediate sensorimotor integration and motor learning...|$|R
40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that glutamate receptor mediated activity {{is required for the}} postnatal development of intracortical connections in layers II/III of rodent barrel cortex. To block glutamate receptors, a slow release polymer (elvax) loaded with a glutamate receptor antagonist (D-AP 5) was targeted subdurally over the future rat barrel cortex on P 0 (day of birth). On P 14 - 16 biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) was injected under the elvax into all layers to label neurons retrogradely. A BDA injection was made stereotactically at the mirror site of the untreated hemisphere of each animal. The animals survived to P 22 - 24. Injection sites and retrogradely labeled cell bodies were identified in tangential sections in relation to the barrel map. D-AP 5 treated and untreated hemispheres were matched according to the location of the injection site in the barrel map. Glutamate receptor blockade did not prevent the growth of intrinsic projections, but altered their organization. The normal row-like asymmetry of connections in untreated hemispheres was lacking in the D-AP 5 treated cortex (ANOVA, p = 0. 02). Cortical activity mediated through glutamate receptors contributes to the correct development of <b>connections</b> between <b>barrel</b> columns in layers II/III...|$|R
40|$|Background: Cross-modal {{plasticity}} {{is characterized}} as the hypersensitivity of remaining modalities after a sensory function {{is lost in}} rodents, which ensures their awareness to environmental changes. Cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cross-modal sensory plasticity remain unclear. We aim to study the role {{of different types of}} neurons in cross-modal plasticity. Methodology/Principal Findings: In addition to behavioral tasks in mice, whole-cell recordings at the excitatory and inhibitory neurons, and their two-photon imaging, were conducted in piriform cortex. We produced a mouse model of cross-modal sensory plasticity that olfactory function was upregulated by trimming whiskers to deprive their sensory inputs. In the meantime of olfactory hypersensitivity, pyramidal neurons and excitatory synapses were functionally upregulated, as well as GABAergic cells and inhibitory synapses were downregulated in piriform cortex from the mice of cross-modal sensory plasticity, compared with controls. A crosswire <b>connection</b> between <b>barrel</b> cortex and piriform cortex was established in cross-modal plasticity. Conclusion/Significance: An upregulation of pyramidal neurons and a downregulation of GABAergic neurons strengthen the activities of neuronal networks in piriform cortex, which may be responsible for olfactory hypersensitivity after a loss of whisker tactile input. This finding provides the clues for developing therapeutic strategies to promote sensory recovery and substitution...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{we examine}} {{the extent to which}} legislators receive elec toral {{benefits}} from altering the geographic distribution of federal outlays. Although there are both theoretical and anecdotal reasons to believe in the existence of such benefits, previous empirical work has largely failed to verify the <b>connection</b> between pork <b>barreling</b> and reelection. We ex amine House incumbents during the 1980 s, when budget deficits were allegedly forcing legislators to end the acquisition of distributive benefits, and we discover that legislators did in fact reap electoral benefits from pork barreling in the 1980 s. We further discover that there is a sharp partisan difference in the marginal effects of federal outlays: additional federal monies strongly affect Democratic reelection margins but barely impact the electoral fortunes of Republicans. This conclusion has impor tant implications for current debates about Congress, divided govern ment, and the recent Republican takeover of Congress...|$|R
25|$|Another {{example is}} from Whorf's {{experience}} as a chemical engineer working for an insurance company as a fire inspector. While inspecting a chemical plant he observed that the plant had two storage rooms for gasoline barrels, one for the full barrels {{and one for the}} empty ones. He further noticed that while no employees smoked cigarettes in the room for full barrels, no-one minded smoking in the room with empty barrels, although this was potentially much more dangerous because of the highly flammable vapors still in the barrels. He concluded that {{the use of the word}} empty in <b>connection</b> to the <b>barrels</b> had led the workers to unconsciously regard them as harmless, although consciously they were probably aware of the risk of explosion. This example was later criticized by Lenneberg as not actually demonstrating causality between the use of the word empty and the action of smoking, but instead was an example of circular reasoning. Pinker in The Language Instinct ridiculed this example, claiming that this was a failing of human insight rather than language.|$|R
40|$|Urbanization {{increases}} {{the volume of}} stormwater runoff from homes, businesses and other paved areas of the urbanized landscape. Unable to infiltrate into the ground, stormwater is directed to facilities that can easily become overloaded and cause a variety of water quality issues. This study aims to assess urban homeowners’ motivations to adopt and maintain rain barrels, a stormwater best management practice (BMP), and evaluate how this BMP diffuses throughout a community. This research {{took place in the}} Great Bend of the Wabash River (Lafayette-West Lafayette, Indiana) and Salt Creek (Valparaiso, Indiana) watersheds and featured a mail survey of 571 residents, site performance evaluations of 130 rain barrels, a “windshield” assessment of 242 rain barrels, and 31 in-person interviews. Our results show that 88 % of homeowners in the Great Bend of the Wabash River watershed have maintained their rain barrels after two years and 65 % of homeowners in Salt Creek watershed after 5 years. One of the biggest issues homeowners had with maintaining their rain barrels were issues with water pressure. We also found that 94 % of rain barrel owners maintain a flower or vegetable garden and their primary motivation for adopting a rain barrel was to reduce water use for their yard or house. Outreach may need to focus more on the importance of maintaining the rain barrels as well as emphasizing the <b>connection</b> between rain <b>barrels</b> and personal gardening...|$|R
40|$|The somatotopically {{organized}} whisker barrel {{field of}} the rat primary somatosensory (S 1) cortex is a commonly used model system for anatomical and physiological investigations of sensory processing. The neural <b>connections</b> of the <b>barrel</b> cortex have been extensively mapped. But most investigations have focused on connections to limited regions of the brain, and overviews {{in the literature of}} the connections across the brain thus build on a range of material from different laboratories, presented in numerous publications. Furthermore, given the limitations of the conventional journal article format, analyses and interpretations are hampered by lack of access to the underlying experimental data. New opportunities for analyses have emerged with the recent release of an online resource of experimental data consisting of collections of high-resolution images from 6 experiments in which anterograde tracers were injected in S 1 whisker or forelimb representations. Building on this material, we have conducted a detailed analysis of the brain wide distribution of the efferent projections of the rat barrel cortex. We compare our findings with the available literature and reports accumulated in the Brain Architecture Management System (BAMS 2) database. We report well-known and less known intracortical and subcortical projections of the barrel cortex, as well as distinct differences between S 1 whisker and forelimb related projections. Our results correspond well with recently published overviews, but provide additional information about relative differences among S 1 projection targets. Our approach demonstrates how collections of shared experimental image data are suitable for brain-wide analysis and interpretation of connectivity mapping data...|$|R
40|$|Rats {{can readily}} {{be trained to}} jump a gap of around 16 cm {{in the dark and}} a {{considerably}} larger gap in the light for a food reward. In the light, they use vision to estimate the distance to be jumped. In the dark, they use their vibrissae at the farthest distances. Bilateral whisker shaving or barrel field lesions reduce the gap crossed in the dark by about 2 cm. Information from the barrel fields reaches motor areas via cortico-cortical, basal ganglia, or cerebellar pathways. The cells of origin of the ponto-cerebellar pathway are segregated in layer Vb of the barrel field. Efferent axons of Vb cells occupy a central position within the basis pedunculi and terminate on cells in the pontine nuclei. Pontine cells, in turn, project to the cerebellar cortex as mossy fibers. We trained normal rats to cross a gap in the light and in a dark alley that was illuminated with an infra-red source. When the performance was stable, we made unilateral lesions in the central region of the basis pedunculi, which interrupted <b>connections</b> from the <b>barrel</b> field to the pons while leaving cortico-cortical and basal ganglia pathways intact. Whisking was not affected on either side by the lesion, and the rats with unilateral peduncle lesions crossed gaps of the same distance as they did pre-operatively. Shaving the whiskers {{on the side of the}} face that retains its input to the pontine nuclei reduced the maximal gap jumped in the dark by the same amount as bilateral whisker shaving. Performance in the light was not affected. Regrowth of the shaved whiskers was associated with the recovery of the maximum distance crossed in the dark. In control cases, shaving the whiskers on the other side of the face did not reduce the distance jumped in the dark or in the light. These results suggest that the cerebellum must receive whisker information from the barrel fields for whisker-guided jumps...|$|R
