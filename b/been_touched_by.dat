5|$|Her death caused {{reactions}} {{not just}} within Saskatchewan and the curling community, but also across the country. Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chrétien {{said in a}} statement: All Canadians have <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler. Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life, qualities that were so clearly in evidence as she fought so valiantly against her illness. She will be sorely missed. In honour of Schmirler, flags at provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.|$|E
5|$|Charles' {{choices were}} appropriate. Philip was {{culturally}} Spanish: {{he was born}} in Valladolid and raised in the Spanish court, his native tongue was Spanish, and he preferred to live in Spain. Ferdinand was familiar with, and to, the other princes of the Holy Roman Empire. Although he too had been born in Spain, he had administered his brother's affairs in the Empire since 1531. Some historians maintain Ferdinand had also <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the reformed philosophies, and was probably the closest the Holy Roman Empire ever came to a Protestant emperor; he remained at least nominally a Catholic throughout his life, although reportedly he refused last rites on his deathbed. Other historians maintain that while Ferdinand was a practicing Catholic, unlike his brother he considered religion to be outside the political sphere.|$|E

5|$|On a kickoff, {{the ball}} is placed at the 35-yard line of the kicking team in {{professional}} and college play and at the 40-yard line in high school play. The ball may be drop-kicked or place-kicked. If a place kick is chosen, the ball can {{be placed on the}} ground or on a tee, and a holder may be used in either case. On a safety kick, the kicking team kicks the ball from their own 20-yard line. They can punt, drop-kick or place-kick the ball, but a tee may not be used in professional play. Any member of the receiving team may catch or advance the ball, and the ball may be recovered by the kicking team once it has gone at least ten yards and has touched the ground or has <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> any member of the receiving team.|$|E

25|$|On any kicking play, all onside players (the kicker, and {{teammates}} behind the kicker {{at the time}} of the kick) may recover and advance the ball. Players on the kicking team who are not onside may not approach within five yards of the ball until it has <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the receiving team, or by an onside teammate.|$|E
25|$|Defending {{indirect}} free-kicks provides different {{difficulties for}} the defending team. The wall {{must be prepared}} to charge down the ball once it has <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill. Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 degrees angle which is very effective.|$|E
25|$|According to kashrut, {{meat and}} poultry may not be {{combined}} with dairy products, nor may they touch plates or utensils that have <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> dairy products.

25|$|Fabius' {{constant}} {{harassment of}} Hannibal's force handicapped the latter's command abilities and gained many prisoners. Both commanders {{decided that they}} would exchange prisoners under the same conditions as in the First Punic War. Although the Carthaginians returned to the Romans several hundred more prisoners than they received and were thus expecting monetary compensation, the Senate was reluctant to pay. However, the estates of Fabius had not <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the Carthaginian pillage parties in order to incite distrust against him. Fabius now sold these estates to pay the enemy army for the received surplus of prisoners.|$|E
25|$|When {{the referee}} is {{satisfied}} that the players are properly positioned, he/she blows the whistle {{to indicate that the}} kicker may kick. The kicker may make feinting (deceptive or distracting) moves during the run-up to the ball, but once the run-up is completed he/she may no longer feint and must kick the ball. The ball must be stationary before the kick, and it must be kicked forward. The ball is in play once it is kicked and moves, and at that time other players may enter the penalty area. Once kicked, the kicker may not touch the ball again until it has <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> another player of either team or goes out of play (including into the goal).|$|E
25|$|Another survey {{conducted}} in 2006 by researchers from Australia's Monash University {{sought to determine}} what types of phenomena that people claim to have experienced and the effects these experiences have had on their lives.

The results revealed that around 70% of the respondents believe to have had an unexplained paranormal event that changed their life, mostly in a positive way. About 70% also claimed to have seen, heard, or <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> an animal or person that they knew was not there; 80% have reported having a premonition, and almost 50% stated they recalled a previous life.|$|E

25|$|The lumber {{boom that}} {{swept through the}} hills and forests of Pennsylvania did not reach Laurel Hill Valley until 1886. At this time the area {{was one of the}} last in Pennsylvania that had not <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> the lumbermen. The {{mountains}} were stripped of the old-growth forests of hemlock and white pine. The lumbermen took the logs to the sawmill where they were cut into lumber. Smaller logs were used to reinforce the mine shafts of the many coal mines throughout southwestern Pennsylvania and West Virginia. The bark of the hemlock tree was used as a source of tannin at the tanneries of the area. The only thing the lumbermen left behind was the treetops. These tree tops were left to dry. The passing steam locomotives on the railroads would ignite this dry brush causing massive wildfires that swept through the mountains and valleys. The Laurel Hill area was left to waste. The forests struggled to regrow in the wake of the wildfire. The hills began to erode. The streams were dying and wildlife was scarcely found.|$|E
25|$|On {{the third}} {{play of the}} second half, Welker's six catch of the game made him the first player in NFL history to record six catches {{in the first nine}} games of a season. The ensuing 13-play drive culminated with a 37-yard Gostkowski field goal that gave the Patriots a 13–3 lead. An {{exchange}} of punts gave the Bills the ball at their own 19-yard line to begin their next drive, which advanced to the Bills' 45-yard line before Edwards' second interception of the day, this one to O'Neal, gave the Patriots the ball back at their own 41-yard line for the final play of the fourth quarter. Five plays later, Cassel was sacked for the only time in the game at the Bills' 44-yard line by defensive lineman Marcus Stroud and safety George Wilson; Stroud forced a fumble in the process and Wilson recovered it at the spot of the sack. The Bills' next drive ended in a Brian Moorman punt that the Patriots the ball at their own 8-yard line with just over 11 minutes remaining in the game. The Patriots then embarked on a 19-play, 92-yard drive that tied a franchise record set in 2002 for number of plays in a single drive; it was also the Patriots' NFL-leading 22nd drive of ten or more plays. It ended with a 1-yard Green-Ellis touchdown run that extended the Patriots' lead to 20–3 with 1:57 remaining in the game. The Bills responded on the ensuing kickoff with an 85-yard return by Leodis McKelvin, setting up a 14-yard touchdown catch by fellow rookie James Hardy on the next play to cut the Patriots' lead to 20–10. The Bills then attempted an onside kick, which appeared to be recovered by the Bills but was then ruled to be dead at the spot as it had <b>been</b> <b>touched</b> <b>by</b> a Bills player before traveling the necessary 10 yards. Three kneeldowns by the Patriots gave them a 20–10 win to better their record to 6–3.|$|E

[...] Not only did it win the contest for the Wolverines, but it marked {{one of the few times}} wherein a center is credited with having scored a touchdown...
