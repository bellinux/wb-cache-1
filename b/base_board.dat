25|$|The spindle, carved {{to reduce}} {{friction}} {{at one end}} and maximize it at the other, is held in a hole {{in the bottom of the}} bearing block, and at the other by the <b>base</b> <b>board</b> (which also is known variously as the hearth, hearth board, or fireboard). The string of the bow is wrapped once around it, so that it is tight enough not to slip during operation. A variation on this is called the Egyptian Bow Drill. It attaches the string by wrapping it around multiple times, or actually tying it to the drill or through a hole through the drill shaft, then wrapping it.|$|E
25|$|The ballet {{became famous}} for Nijinsky's leap {{through one of}} the two large windows {{at the back of the}} stage. The height of the leap was an {{illusion}} though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (<b>base</b> <b>board)</b> under the window was very low, giving the illusion that the leap was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one in the audience saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, the leap was given a sense of great length and height.|$|E
500|$|A second {{challenge}} {{was how to}} overcome {{the rotation of the}} suspended parts – the sub-chassis, platter, arm and cartridge – relative to the motor. This was done by re-imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to the drive motor. The Xerxes uses a relatively light medium-density fibreboard (MDF) top board on which the bearing and tonearm assemblies are mounted. Firm rubber [...] "Blobs" [...] mounted on the bottom board (along with the motor assembly) support yet decouple from the top board. Aesthetically, the two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to the <b>base</b> <b>board</b> with screws. These design principles can be seen throughout the evolution of the Xerxes, right through to the Xerxes 20plus.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a set of}} open source, integrated tools for developing embedded real-time applications, especially targeted to the automotive industry. The set of tools comprises a schedulability analyzer, a kernel library and a kernel configurator. The goal is to achieve portability of the application over different hardware platforms without sacrificing performance. With our tools, the programmer only need to write the application tasks using standard kernel primitives; then the optimization phase is carried out {{with the help of}} the kConfigurator tool, which automatically configures the kernel library to obtain maximum performance. So far, the tools have been provided for ST 10 /C 166 microprocessor <b>based</b> <b>boards,</b> we are currently working on a version for ARM 7 TDMI <b>based</b> <b>boards...</b>|$|R

50|$|Stripboard is {{available}} from many vendors. All versions have copper strips on one side. Some are made using printed circuit board etching and drilling techniques, although some have milled strips and punched holes. The original Veroboard used FR-2 synthetic-resin-bonded paper (SRBP) (also known as phenolic board) as the <b>base</b> <b>board</b> material. Some versions of stripboard now use higher quality FR-4 (fiberglass-reinforced epoxy laminate) material.|$|E
50|$|Wire wrap {{construction}} {{can produce}} assemblies {{which are more}} reliable than printed circuits: connections are less prone to fail due to vibration or physical stresses on the <b>base</b> <b>board,</b> {{and the lack of}} solder precludes soldering faults such as corrosion, cold joints and dry joints. The connections themselves are firmer and have lower electrical resistance due to cold welding of the wire to the terminal post at the corners.|$|E
