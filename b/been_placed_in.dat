5|$|Agaricus hondensis, {{commonly}} known as the felt-ringed agaricus, is a species of fungus in the family Agaricaceae.

This fungus has had a varied taxonomical history, having <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> fourteen genera before finally settling in Cyptotrama. This species is differentiated from several other similar members of genus Cyptotrama by variations in cap color, and spore size and shape.|$|E

5|$|Keyser and de Houtman {{assigned}} {{twelve stars}} to the constellation. Bayer depicted Grus on his chart, {{but did not}} assign its stars Bayer designations. French explorer and astronomer Nicolas Louis de Lacaille labelled them Alpha to Phi in 1756 with some omissions. In 1879, American astronomer Benjamin Gould added Kappa, Nu, Omicron and Xi, which had all been catalogued by Lacaille but not given Bayer designations. Lacaille considered them too faint, while Gould thought otherwise. Xi Gruis had originally <b>been</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> Microscopium.

5|$|Magdalena Moshi also {{received}} a universality place for the women's 50 m freestyle, but {{failed to make the}} semi-finals at the Games, placing equal 67th (with Angelika Ouedraogo of Burkino Faso) overall.

Born in Australia, but raised in Tanzania, she trained in the country of her birth and was a veteran of the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics as Tanzania's first female swimmer. This made her one of only two Tanzanian women to have competed in three editions of the Games as of 2016.|$|E
5|$|Roy E. Halling {{designated}} a lectotype specimen in 1983 from Frost's original collections.

Recognizing its genetic and morphological distinctiveness, they created the genus Sutorius, with S.eximius as the type species. As of 2015, the only other species in Sutorius is S.australiensis, found in Australia.|$|E
