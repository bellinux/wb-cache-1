Roger was employed as a civil servant in the Northern Ireland Department of Health and Social Services, and so did his Mathematics outside of his working hours. Apart from the fact that Trevor got on very well with Roger, it suited Trevor to have Roger among his Northern Ireland friends and informants on political matters.

500|$|Sorabji's symphonic first {{movements}} have been labelled as [...] "symphonic tapestries" [...] and [...] "a kind of pure music drama". Their organisation {{is related to}} that of his Second and Third Piano Sonatas and {{to that of the}} closing movement of the First Organ Symphony. They have been described as being based superficially on either the fugue or the sonata-allegro form, but they differ from the normal application of those forms in that the exposition and development of themes are guided not by conventional tonal principles but <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> themes, {{in the words of the}} musicologist Simon John Abrahams, [...] "battle with each other for domination of the texture".

It uses the sequence B–D–E–A–A♯ as a bass line during the refrain, the chorus, and the bridge, and uses a chord progression of F♯–G♯m–E–B for the verses. The song is constructed in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a rapped bridge before the third and final chorus. Musically, it is [...] "energised" [...] by a highly syncopated synthesised riff, and <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> repetitive lyrics and rhythm are highlighted during the bridge.
