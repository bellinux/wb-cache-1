5|$|The third {{biological}} control agent to target Neoscapteriscus in Florida was the South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci. Small-scale releases proved it could persist for years in mole-cricket-infested sandy Florida soils. Its use as a <b>biopesticide</b> against Neoscapteriscus was patented, making it attractive to industry. Industrial-scale production on artificial diet allowed large-scale trial applications in pastures and on golf courses, which succeeded in establishing populations in several counties, and these populations spread, but sales were disappointing, and the product was withdrawn from the market in 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{essential}} oil has displayed antimicrobial properties in vitro, and can {{function as a}} <b>biopesticide,</b> especially regarding Tropidion castaneum beetles and Camponotus maculatus carpenter ants. Several terpenoids isolated from P.atriplicifolia have been investigated for potential inhibitory effects on the hepatitis B virus. Its traditional use as an anti-inflammatory {{has been attributed to}} the ability of the lignan (+)-taxiresinol and five other compounds to act as leukotriene antagonists. The isorinic acid derivative perovskoate may also contribute to an anti-inflammatory effect as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor. Interaction with opioid and cannabinoid receptors has been proposed as the mechanism of traditionally reported analgesic effects.|$|E

40|$|<b>Biopesticides,</b> a {{complementary}} and alternative {{approach to the}} use of agrochemicals. A review. <b>Biopesticides</b> are living organisms or products derived from them, which have the ability to suppress or to reduce pests. <b>Biopesticides</b> have been used for centuries by farmers and these products offer many advantages. Today, <b>biopesticides</b> are classified into three groups according to their origin (microbial, plant or animal). They can be used both in conventional agriculture and in organic farming. Some <b>biopesticides</b> allow plants to withstand abiotic stress and, in general, they are less toxic than their chemical counterparts. Although they often have the reputation for being less effective than chemical pesticides, <b>biopesticides</b> are the subject of growing interest among farmers, particularly in the context of Integrated Pest Management strategies. The marketing of <b>biopesticides</b> is facilitated in some regions, such as the USA, while in others, such as Western Europe, the approval process is long and expensive. The future development of <b>biopesticides</b> depends on many factors, such as government policies both in terms of research support and in regulating agribusiness strategies, and the evolution of consumer choice...|$|R

Through these case studies, we demonstrate that <b>biopesticides</b> rely on both chemical and biochemical approaches and complementary biological modalities. Hence, <b>biopesticides</b> are more complex than synthetic pesticides. The latter typically utilize a single chemical with a single mode of action, while the former often have more complex or holistic modes of action.

Empirical studies revealed {{that in addition}} to farmers’ socioeconomic characteristics and institutional factors, farmers’ perceptions of the innovation-specific characteristics are particularly important in determining whether or not to adopt them. This study assessed vegetables farmers’ perceptions of botanical extracts and <b>biopesticides</b> compared with current chemical pesticides. It also examined the relationship between farmers’ perceptions and the adoption of botanical extracts and <b>biopesticides.</b> Data were collected from a stratified randomly sample of 198 vegetables farmers selected in vegetable producing zones in Benin and interviewed for their use and perceptions on the efficiency of the botanical extracts and <b>biopesticides</b> on the pests and diseases they faced. The paper used on the one hand the ordered probit to identify factors that are likely to affect farmers’ perceptions {{and on the other hand}} the selection model to estimate the impact of these perceptions on botanical extracts and <b>biopesticides</b> adoption. Results indicated that botanical extracts and <b>biopesticides</b> were perceived by farmers to have slow action, require more labor and skill for the extraction and require many sprays. Empirical results from the ordered probit showed that farmers’ perceptions of botanical extracts and <b>biopesticides</b> varied according to their experience in vegetables production, education level, contact with extension agents and researchers as well as gender.
