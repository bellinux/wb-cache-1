40|$|The purpose of {{the article}} is to analyze the {{relationship}} and interaction between gender identity and power relations in society; to study specific features <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identity’s representation in the contemporary socio – cultural discourse; to examine the role <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> regimes in the process <b>of</b> reproduction <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> inequality.  Methodology.  For analysing the relationship and mutual influence <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identity and power relations in society, and studying the mechanism <b>of</b> reproduction <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> inequality is methodologically important to use comparative and concrete – historical methods. Since many researchers noted that the content <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identity in different historical and cultural contexts is changed, it sounds methodologically reasonable to study this problem on the dialectical position that allowed us {{to see that the}} basis of all social institutions is the «problem of ifference» justifying «the problem of domination». Paying attention with the nature of the process, it is extremely important to provide the principle of methodological pluralism. Variability both the substantial contest of elements of identity and their definitions warrants the use of comparative historical method that allows us to analyze the real social and cultural changes.  Scientific novelty.  The analysis given in the article demonstrates that social institutions {{have an impact on the}} formation of gender identity through gender regimes. It is revealed that the transformation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> inequality is not an inevitable result of biological differences in gender identities. It is proved that biological difference is used to justify the authorities and legitimate the gender inequality. It is established that the biological difference is used to justify social and political inequality <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identities. The mechanism of continuous reproduction <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> inequality through the work <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> regimes which legitimate the hierarchy <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identities is described.  Conclusions.  Understanding how gender inequalities can serve as a starting point for understanding the causes of all kinds of inequalities.  Social institutions such as work, education, family, are, in essence, is not neutral, but genderized and serve the reproduction <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> order a certain socio-cultural context as a standard...|$|R

It also implies developing {{a critique of the}} representation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identity in the four short stories of Mmualebe; comparing traditionalism and modernity with regard to the representation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identity; describing possible responses of the implied readers (male and female) with regard to reception aesthetics and developmental psychology; and to supply the variants and constants regarding the representation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> identity in the four short stories of Mmualebe.

40|$|The {{starting}} point for this thesis is to problematize the male-dominated language of The Swedish Hymnal and the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> it involves. The purpose has been: to clarify the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> and ecclesiology in The Swedish Hymnal and in the Swedish Church's General Synod and to develop an understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> for the church in an equal society. To this end I have examined the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the hymn texts from a gender perspective {{as well as an}} ecclesiological perspective. I have also studied the meaning of the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the hymn texts in their wider cultural and social context. I have made use of theoretical approaches and strategies from feminism, feminist theology, ecclesiology, and theories about the importance of language in relation to the society in which it operates. The main result is that the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the hymn texts is markedly dichotomous and value discriminatory to women's disadvantage, and must be regarded as an obstacle to equality. With regard to the ecclesiology of the hymn texts I have used the model of the church - a community for the same conditions as an interpretative key. This has shown that even the ecclesiology of the texts is asymmetric to advantage of men. As regards the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> and ecclesiology in the Synod, I have found that the category <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> almost never is linked to equality. When placing the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the hymn texts in a wider cultural and social context it appears that the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> <b>of</b> the hymn texts underpins an understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> that claims the specificity <b>of</b> each <b>gender</b> and a society where only words that connotes male human beings become a model for this community. This has epistemological implications. Finally, with a foundation in the survey results and the theoretical perspectives, I have developed a language without a dichotomous and value discriminatory understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender.</b> This language is characterized by the presentation of women and men {{in such a way that}} eliminates gender stereotypes and above all that the deity so as to connote both women and men. The main conclusion of my studies is that the problems with the <b>gender</b> understanding <b>of</b> the hymn book is a consequence of expressing the deity with markers that connotes male human beings, so that divine and manly interplay. In addition, a significant gender-blindness in the decision-making body of the church is a cause. Another conclusion is that the understanding <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> in The Swedish Hymnal has a structuring effect on society at large.

There are various structures <b>of</b> <b>gendered</b> policy-making practice that suggest both possibilities for, and obstacles to, the advancement <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> equality in policy making.

While scholarship has shown the various ways women are materially and symbolically ‘fixed’ in place, less {{attention has been paid}} to how discourses and practices of mobility interface with systems <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> differentiation more broadly. This work is based on a robust empirical base of 55 interviews, 90 h of participant observation and an analysis of museum displays in Kalgoorile, Western Australia, an iconic frontier mining town selected for this investigation as a site <b>of</b> strongly bifurcated <b>gender</b> discourses. Analysing our field data through the lens of feminist theory which problematizes gender binaries, we argue that while some narrations <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> mobilities serve to reinforce gender binaries, lived practices of movement can also destabilise (idealised) notions <b>of</b> <b>gendered</b> movement. This paper extends conceptual work by advancing understanding about {{the role of}} mobility within systems <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> differentiation, showing how lived practices of mobility are just as likely to challenge idealised patterns <b>of</b> <b>gendered</b> movement as they are to reinforce these patterns.

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} {{reintroduce}} discussions on gender relations in politics back into scholarly and political debate. Many countries have adopted gender quotas, {{but it is}} unclear whether their implementation has meaningfully changed the prevalent inequalities governing gender relations in politics. This article considers whether the implementation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> quotas could promote change, and assesses this change with reference to five criteria formerly used to assess the strategy <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> mainstreaming. These are a shift towards a more comprehensive concept <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> equality; the incorporation <b>of</b> a <b>gender</b> perspective intersected with other inequalities in mainstream politics; equal political representation; organizational changes in selection and recruitment mechanisms as well as the functioning of politics; and, finally, the displacement of hierarchies, and the empowerment of subjects. Reflection on and empirical illustrations <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> quotas with regard to these criteria reveal a mixed picture, demonstrating the need to reintroduce discussions about gender equality within politics back into gender quota debates. This discussion will not focus on the legitimacy of or need for gender quotas, but on how their implementation can contribute to the improvement <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> relations in politics beyond a quantitative sense. Approaching gender quotas through the use of criteria devised for assessing the gender mainstreaming strategy is helpful in exploring the potential <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> quotas in the transformation <b>of</b> <b>gender</b> relations...|$|R
