5|$|As an {{illiterate}} child, she had <b>been</b> <b>told</b> Bible {{stories by}} her mother. The particular variety of her early Christian belief remains unclear, but she acquired a passionate faith in God.

Tubman was devout, and when she began experiencing visions and vivid dreams, she interpreted them as revelations from God. This religious perspective informed her actions throughout her life.|$|E

5|$|Chamberlain was {{not made}} a Privy Councillor.

Chamberlain nearly resigned in June 1917 when, having not <b>been</b> <b>told</b> or consulted, he read in the newspapers {{that he had been}} given a new Parliamentary Secretary.|$|E

50|$|While {{this theory}} is {{considered}} exceedingly unlikely by some, {{it is not}} so considered by Janina Fialkowska, the pianist who premiered Liszt's Piano Concerto No. 3 in 1990.

Nevertheless, little progress was made, and, after a brief move which saw No. 6 Commando advance to Bavent, they went on the defensive again.|$|E
