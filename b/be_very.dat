5|$|The greater melampitta is {{reported}} to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> shy and wary, but also inquisitive and may approach people sitting quietly to investigate. It is usually revealed by its calls, and can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> difficult to locate {{if it is not}} calling.|$|E

5|$|It is {{possible}} to produce a plasma that is not quasineutral. An electron beam, for example, has only negative charges. The density of a non-neutral plasma must generally <b>be</b> <b>very</b> low, or it must <b>be</b> <b>very</b> small, otherwise it will be dissipated by the repulsive electrostatic force.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the company}} has proven to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> profitable, they have had much less success at {{producing}} winning teams. Of the three major franchises they currently own (Maple Leafs, Raptors and Toronto FC), only the Maple Leafs have ever won a championship, but not since their 1967 Stanley Cup.|$|E

5|$|An Italian volcanological mission {{analyzed}} gas {{samples from}} fumaroles along the Arenas crater floor and proved {{them to be}} a mixture {{of carbon dioxide and}} sulfur dioxide, indicating a direct release of magma into the surface environment. The mission's report, delivered on October 22, 1985, judged the risk of lahars to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> high. The report proposed various simple preparedness techniques to local authorities.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} {{cockatoo}}s, the red-tailed black cockatoo can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> long-lived in captivity; in 1938, ornithologist Neville Cayley reported one over {{fifty years old}} at Taronga Zoo. Another bird residing at London and Rotterdam Zoos was 45 years and 5 months of age when it died in 1979.|$|E
5|$|Bird {{calls and}} songs, which are {{produced}} in the syrinx, are the major means by which birds communicate with sound. This communication can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> complex; some species can operate {{the two sides of}} the syrinx independently, allowing the simultaneous production of two different songs.|$|E

5|$|Bundling the LITE {{version of}} WinFax {{proved to be}} lucrative for Delrina. Whenever a person used {{the program for the}} first time and {{submitted}} their registration information by fax to the company, Delrina would subsequently mail the user an upgrade offer for the PRO version. This sales technique proved to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> effective, and the firm ended up making most of its sales from these upgrades.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> long-lived, {{especially}} in captive or protected conditions; individuals at the Tower of London have lived {{for more than}} 40 years. Lifespans in the wild are considerably shorter at typically 10 to 15 years. The longest known lifespan of a banded wild common raven was 23 years, 3 months.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{scientists}} from the United Kingdom, United States and Japan (Unit 731 of the imperial Japanese army) were involved in research into producing a biological weapon from smallpox. Plans of large scale production were never carried through as they considered that the weapon would not <b>be</b> <b>very</b> effective due to the wide-scale availability of a vaccine.|$|E

5|$|Fermi, {{learning}} of Ulam's breakthrough, devised an analog computer {{known as the}} Monte Carlo trolley, later dubbed the FERMIAC. The device performed a mechanical simulation of random diffusion of neutrons. As computers improved in speed and programmability, these methods became more useful. In particular, many Monte Carlo calculations carried out on modern massively parallel supercomputers are embarrassingly parallel applications, whose results can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> accurate.|$|E
5|$|File {{artifacts}} and meta-data {{can be used}} to identify the origin of a particular piece of data; for example, older versions of Microsoft Word embedded a Global Unique Identifer into files which identified the computer it had been created on. Proving whether a file was produced on the digital device being examined or obtained from elsewhere (e.g., the Internet) can <b>be</b> <b>very</b> important.|$|E
5|$|Flexing {{the toes}} and feet and {{extending}} on tiptoes, can all <b>be</b> <b>very</b> useful in detecting perforator vein incompetence. These movements unleash a muscle contraction which compresses deep veins. If a perforator valve is incompetent then a reflux {{from the deep}} to the superficial through the perforator vein will be registered.|$|E

5|$|Girlschool {{remained}} anyway {{a strong}} live attraction and their 1982 world tour led the band {{for the first}} time in the USA to play in stadiums, supporting Iron Maiden and Scorpions. NWOBHM acts like Judas Priest and Def Leppard started to <b>be</b> <b>very</b> popular in America and the girls and their record label had no intention to fall back in the conquest of that large market.|$|E
5|$|How these {{clusters}} {{are formed}} {{is not yet}} known, but their formation might well be related to that of globular clusters. Why M31 has such clusters, while the Milky Way does not, is not yet known. It is also unknown if any other galaxy contains these types of clusters, but it would <b>be</b> <b>very</b> unlikely that M31 is the sole galaxy with extended clusters.|$|E
