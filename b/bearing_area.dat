500|$|During {{the second}} phase, after {{determining}} {{that the proposed}} weight of the monument was too great for the old foundation to safely bear, {{the thickness of the}} walls atop the unfinished stump was reduced and the foundation was strengthened by adding a large unreinforced concrete slab below the perimeter of the old foundation to increase the monument's load <b>bearing</b> <b>area</b> two and one half times. The slab was [...] thick, with an outer perimeter [...] square, an inner perimeter [...] square, with undisturbed loam inside the inner perimeter except for the water well. The area {{at the base of the}} second phase foundation is [...] The strengthened foundation (old foundation and concrete slab) has a total depth of [...] below the bottom of the lowest course of marble blocks (now below ground), and [...] below the entry lobby floor. Casey reported that nowhere did the load exceed [...] and did not exceed [...] near the outer perimeter. To properly distribute the load from the shaft to slab, about half by volume of the outer periphery of the old rubble foundation below its top step was removed. A continuous sloping unreinforced concrete buttress encircles what remains. The buttress is [...] square at its base, [...] square at its top, and [...] high. The perimeter of the original top step of the old rubble foundation rests on the larger top of the concrete buttress. Its slope (lower external angle from the vertical) is 49°. This buttress rests in a depression (triangular cross-section) on the top surface of the concrete slab. The slab was constructed by digging pairs of [...] wide drifts on opposite sides of the monument's center line to keep the monument properly balanced. The drifts were filled with unreinforced concrete with depressions or dowel stones on their sides to interlock the sections. An earthen terrace [...] wide with its top at the base of the walls and steep sides was constructed in 1880–81 over the reinforced foundation while the rest of the monument was being constructed. During 1887–88, a knoll was constructed around the terrace tapering out roughly [...] onto the surrounding terrain. This earthen terrace and knoll serves as an additional buttress for the foundation. The weight of the foundation is , including earth and gneiss rubble above the concrete foundation that is within its outer perimeter.|$|E

40|$|A {{decrease}} in proteoglycan (Pg) content and disturbances in the collagen network {{have been reported}} in aging cartilage. This study aims to determine whether these changes are associated with proteolytic enzymes such as neutral metalloproteases. Eighty lateral tibial plateaus were collected from subjects after death. The age, topographical area, and lesion severity (macroscopic grading) of each specimen were noted and the effects of neutral metallo-Pg-degrading and collagenolytic enzymes on these specimens were compared. The specimens were divided into two age groups: 20 - 50 years (group 1) and greater than 50 years (group 2). They were selected from both weight bearing and non-weight <b>bearing</b> <b>areas.</b> In some cartilage tissues the superficial layer was separated from the deep zone. Our data for the two neutral metalloenzymes examined showed: no correlation between enzyme activity and age when the specimens were of the same grade and a statistically significant rise in the enzyme levels of the older specimens, which increased as the lesions progressed. Neutral metallo-Pg-degrading enzyme activity was higher in non-weight <b>bearing</b> <b>areas</b> than in weight <b>bearing</b> <b>areas,</b> and this reached a statistical difference in the older cartilage with advanced lesions. The Pg-degrading enzyme activity was raised in the superficial layers of damaged cartilage tissue. Our data suggest that neutral metalloproteases are closely associated with the appearance and progression of the changes seen in aging cartilage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{north-eastern}} Serbia {{is one of}} {{the most}} important ore <b>bearing</b> <b>areas</b> in Yugoslavia and Balkan. The Bor and Majdanpek are world-wide known copper ore deposits. Mineralization is connected with the Upper Cretaceous magmatism. The main ore controlling factor is fracture pattern. The investigations of structural and morphological characteristics carried out in the wider Majdanpek area supplied new data on disjunctive structures and indicated an intensive neotectonic activity. A high degree of correspondence between the older fracture pattern and neotectonically active ruptures has been discovered. Tectonic activity that produced the Upper Cretaceous magmatism was prolonged through the Tertiary and Quaternary. The older ruptures were neotectonically reactivated, changing many times the sense and intensity of vertical movements. The obtained results are a reliable base for selection of perspective ore <b>bearing</b> <b>areas</b> and rational planning of further detailed field structural and metallogenic investigations...|$|R
