5|$|Bowling {{a mixture}} of medium pace and his new style of off spin, Macaulay played 27 matches in 1921. After taking wickets {{steadily}} {{at the start of}} the season, in his fourth game he took six wickets for ten runs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 72. Four more wickets in the second innings gave Yorkshire a <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> and Macaulay had match figures of ten wickets for 65 runs, the first time he had taken ten wickets in a match. Macaulay then came to wider public attention by taking six wickets for three runs to bowl out Derbyshire for 23 runs. He later took ten wickets in the match against Surrey in a losing cause, and in total that season he took 101 first-class wickets at an average of 17.33, placing him third in the Yorkshire bowling averages. With the bat, he scored 457 runs at an average of 22.59, surprising commentators with his ability. This included a maiden first-class century against Nottinghamshire. His innings of 125 not out took Yorkshire from 211 for seven wickets when he came in to bat (228 for eight soon after) to a total of 438 for nine declared, a lead of 264; Yorkshire went on to a comfortable win. His overall success in the season meant that his place in the team was secure.|$|E

This ineffectiveness was predicted by Hanoi's analyses of weaknesses and contradictions in their enemy's camp (Vo Nguyen Giap, <b>Big</b> <b>Victory,</b> Great Task) An initial policy of gradualism against North Vietnam for example, saw the American President and his Secretary of Defence huddled over maps and charts, planning piecemeal airstrikes on limited targets. These inflicted some localized damage, but had little significant effect on the overall VC/NVA buildup in the south.|$|E

25|$|He {{was again}} called {{up for the}} Australian team prior to Australia's tour of Sri Lanka in 2015. Despite his {{presence}} in the team as consultant, Australia couldn't win {{any of the three}} Test matches, and lost the series 3–0. The Murali's acceptance of the rival side made a huge controversy throughout the country and Sri Lanka Cricket and Muralitharan have traded caustic verbal blows following an altercation between Murali and the Sri Lanka team manager. The Head of SLC Thilanga Sumathipala warned Muralitharan for attempting to coach the Australian team, the team which gave more pressure to Muralitharan in the past due to his bowling actions.Muralitharan also said that the team which was totally against him now called him to coach them to play against Sri Lanka was a <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> in his career.|$|E
25|$|Sussex {{recorded}} a <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> at Hove, smacking the Bangladeshi bowlers at will before bowling them out twice for a pittance, {{which did not}} exactly give the Bangladeshis confidence {{a week before the}} first Test at Lord's. Michael Yardy was the star of the match, notching up 35 fours and two sixes in a towering 257 - the highest score of the English first class season so far - which led Sussex to 549 for 7 declared. In reply, Habibul Bashar got hit by a bouncer from Jason Lewry when on 22 not out, and thus had to retire, and things only went downhill from there. The Bangladeshis could only manage a total of 323 runs from two innings (127 and 196), with 16-year-old wicketkeeper Mushfiqur Rahim the only one who passed forty runs with a two-hour 63 in the second innings, before being stumped off a delivery by the Man of the Match, Yardy - who recorded his first career five-wicket haul, taking five for 83.|$|E

25|$|It was {{discovered}} by the British that {{on the night of}} 1 October, the battalion of Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 21, which had faced the 141st Brigade, had been due for relief that night and left before the replacements arrived. The Germans had quickly rushed up a battalion from support; two companies occupied the Flers Line opposite Eaucourt and one company moved east of Eaucourt but small-arms fire from the foremost troops of the 141st Brigade and British artillery-fire forced the Germans under cover. Another company came west of the village through the gap and re-occupied trenches, just in time to meet the attack of the 1/23rd London the next morning. The dark night, pouring rain and the lack of time for reconnaissance of the captured ground had made the positions captured by the British difficult to defend. The success of III Corps in capturing Eaucourt and Le Sars a few days later, was the last <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> of the Fourth Army in 1916, the subsequent attacks on the Butte de Warlencourt were costly failures. The German infantry opposite the Fourth Army had to defend improvised positions, which were destroyed by British heavy artillery-fire, causing many casualties. (The defeats inflicted by the French led to the sacking of the 2nd Army Chief of Staff, Colonel Bronsart von Schellendorf). The 5th Army at Verdun was ordered to retire from every piece of ground not necessary for the defence of the front to create reserves for the Somme. The six divisions holding the line from Le Transloy to the Ancre were replaced by seven fresh divisions from the end of September to 13 October, two of which were relieved in turn.|$|E

According to Rediff, the rewritten script's basic storyline is that [...] "Love remains eternal and it will follow generations and generations. There is always a <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> for Love." [...] The film's {{flashback}} sequences were used as a flip switch between the film's olden and present day eras. Initially the film featured a scene in which the present day heroine accidentally receives a dupatta preserved in a museum that is used in the flashbacks as the dupatta Bhairava and Ranadheer race for. However, separate dupattas were used in the film as Rajamouli felt that getting the dupatta from the flashback would complicate the narrative.|$|E
500|$|After the game, Buffalo's Coach Gordon said Michigan was [...] "one of {{the most}} {{wonderful}} teams he ever saw," [...] and added, [...] "Michigan can defeat any team in the East." [...] Buffalo had defeated the team from Columbia University, one of the stronger teams in the east, by a score of 50 earlier in the season. The 1901 Columbia team defeated Eastern [...] "Big Four" [...] power Penn, 11–0, and narrowly lost a game to Yale, 10–5. Several newspapers used the Buffalo game {{as a point of}} reference in assessing the strength of Michigan's 1901 team. The Pittsburgh Press reported that Michigan's <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> over a [...] "fairly strong" [...] Buffalo team [...] "shows that Michigan has a remarkable team." [...] The Daily Review from Decatur, Illinois, observed: [...] "Considering the fact that Buffalo trimmed Columbia rather easily, making a larger score against the college than did Harvard or Yale, there seems some justice in" [...] Coach Brown's comments that Michigan could defeat Harvard, Yale or Princeton. The Adrian Daily Telegram opined: [...] "Michigan defeated Buffalo 128 to 0, which clearly demonstrates that she can bump the big eastern four without much fear of disaster." ...|$|E

And that's the way I went, except that it came out {{on the other side of}} the track from the proper entrance. The bunch came in and Serse won the sprint. But then his brother told Serse to go to the judges to object. He told Serse that I hadn't ridden the entire and precise course and that therefore I should be déclassé. But that was below him. Coppi wanted his brother to have a <b>big</b> <b>victory.</b> He was a great champion, Coppi, but to do what he did, to protest like that to get a victory for his brother, that wasn't dignified for a champion. That was below him. A champion like that should never have stooped that low. I never spoke to him about it. Never did. Why should I? ...|$|E
500|$|Australia won the {{remaining}} games {{to win the}} series. In the third match, Crawford scored his only half-century of the series, hitting 62 out of England's 363 to help his team build up a first innings lead. However, Australia scored 506 at the second attempt, during which Crawford bowled nearly 46 overs to take three for 113. The series was settled in the fourth Test; Australia recorded a <b>big</b> <b>victory</b> after rain affected the pitch and created difficult batting conditions during England's first innings. On the first day, Crawford took five for 48, his best Test figures, as Australia were bowled out for 214 on a very good pitch. Wisden noted Crawford [...] " [...] up his pace with remarkable skill". By {{this stage of the}} tour, the press looked on him much more favourably, and he received praise for his performances. However, his heavy workload with the ball affected his health; he lost a stone in weight during the tour, and before the final Test a Melbourne doctor diagnosed that he had [...] "strained {{the right side of his}} heart" [...] and advised that he see a specialist. Crawford played in that game, won by Australia, despite his ill health, with several other players unfit, and the tour manager later wrote that he looked poorly throughout and should not have played. Nevertheless, he bowled 54 overs and took eight wickets in the match.|$|E

The capture of Beaumont Hamel and Serre would go some way to redeem the failure of 1 July and obtain ground on which the British would have a tactical advantage. The attack was {{the largest in the}} British sector since September and had a seven-day preliminary bombardment, which was twice as heavy as that of 1 July. Beaumont Hamel, St Pierre Divion and Beaucourt were captured, which threatened the German hold on Serre further north.
