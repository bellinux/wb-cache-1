40|$|The lived {{experience}} of mothers with multiple sclerosis (MS) who have young children was explored. Using purposive sampling, 10 mothers with MS each {{participated in an}} in-depth semi-structured interview. The participants varied in demographics and had varying symptoms of MS. Interpretative phenomenological analysis identified four major themes. These themes are: changing life perspective; <b>balancing</b> <b>life</b> with MS; having children; and peer contact. The participants went {{through a period of}} avoidance before accepting life with MS and changing their life perspective. Adequately <b>balancing</b> <b>life</b> with MS, by conserving energy and having support networks, was essential to maintaining their well-being. The partners of the participants were the main support providers, although other people stepped in when the partner could not cope. The relationship between the participants and their partners either strengthened or weakened following the diagnosis of MS. Albeit having MS, the participants elected to have children. Having young children was physically taxing, yet very rewarding. Peer contact assisted the participants with a sense of belonging, which indicated the importance of having a wide variety of available peer support programs to assist mothers with MS. The current research provided insight into how such women can be assisted in their pursuit to live contently and mother despite MS. Insight into this experience can also provide increased understanding to the social network of such mothers, which could enhance the quality of interpersonal relationships and stimulate people to provide more support to such mothers. Future research directions are discussed...|$|E

40|$|In {{this article}} the authors {{describe}} a study focusing on middle-aged persons living with chronic heart failure (CHF), {{a group with}} which {{few studies have been}} conducted. They used the lifeworld perspective to focus on persons ’ lived experiences of the phenomenon, that is, living with moderate-severe CHF as a middle-aged person. They interviewed 7 middle-aged persons (4 men, 3 women; aged 38 to 65 years) and analyzed the data obtained using a phenomenolog-ical approach. The phenomenon’s essence is described as a life situation characterized by a failing body, a life constantly under threat, a rapidly changing health condition, and an altered self-image, which implies that the persons live in a changed life situation. The essence was further illuminated by three meaning constituents: an ambiguity of the body, losing track of life, and <b>balancing</b> <b>life.</b> Knowledge from this study will help caregivers understand and support patients with this debilitating condition...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to better {{understand}} the experiences of former female coaches and their decision to terminate their careers, especially in relation to the patriarchal nature of U.

The survey sample included 121 former women coaches who left collegiate athletics in the last ten years. The survey findings suggest that time and family commitments are the main reasons these women left coaching. The open-end comments, however, provided a more complex picture of why women may leave U. S. collegiate coaching. About 18 % of the participants in this sample left coaching for positive reasons such as an opportunity for a promotion or to pursue further education.

40|$|Abstract: Adults {{returning}} to school face challenges including overcoming math anxiety. Many choose online courses as they balance {{life and work}} schedules. Online math courses therefore can be restructured to prevent math anxiety by catering to individual learning styles, providing tools that aid concept attainment, and using problem-based learning strategies. Adults {{returning to}} school face many challenges from <b>balancing</b> <b>life</b> and work schedules, to overcoming age-old math anxiety (Hembree, 1990). Math anxiety is defined as “an inability by an otherwise intelligent person to cope with quantification ” (Krantz, 1999, p. 100). Students who suffer with math anxiety start by doing poorly in mathematical courses, then avoiding such courses, and eventually choosing careers that require minimal math (Betz, 1978). At college level, math anxiety has many causes, including mathematics presented as fixed rules, passive classrooms, teaching styles that do not match learning styles, and students ’ lack of confidence and inability to see {{the relevance of the}} mathematical topics (Trujillo & Hadfield, 1999). Students who are too shy to ask questions or view mathematics as only for men may also experience math anxiety (Trujillo & Hadfield, 1999). Betz (1978) found 61 % to 68 % of student...|$|E

Entrepreneurs seek a logical balance between their job and life and this issue is of great importance to Iranian entrepreneur women. Inability to handle the contrast between work and family is the main source of job stress and ends in job and personal dissatisfaction. To overcome these problems we have to look for solutions that not only meet the organization needs but also imposes less stress on entrepreneurs and thus results in improving their productivity. In this article we have studied female entrepreneurs situation and their share in labor market, as well as flexible methods of doing jobs especially job sharing method. We have done structured interviews with entrepreneurs of Azad University and their attitude to possibility of job sharing and its effect on female entrepreneurs at university has been expressed. After performing the qualitative methods, questionnaires were made and the attitude of female entrepreneurs towards job sharing was examined. The results of quantitative research show that they have a positive attitude towards job sharing but we have to notice that job sharing doesn’t lead in weakening the bargaining ability of female entrepreneurs. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an optimization approach of <b>balancing</b> <b>life</b> cycle cost and environmental impacts for typical Australian houses. It evaluates {{the effects of}} various alternative wall, floor and roofing assemblages to select an optimized house design. A Base House was modified with 18 alternative wall, 4 floor and 8 roofing designs. Each design was varied {{in such a way}} that it achieved specific star rating based on materials and assemblages. Two sets of objective functions, namely life cycle cost and environmental impacts were evaluated for each design using life cycle costing and life cycle assessment approaches, respectively. The use of Linear Programming helped to identify alternative best designs depending on single-objective (SOO) or multi-objective optimization (MOO). Outcomes from SOO depended on the choice of particular objective function, while outcomes from MOO depended on the decision-makers preferences in terms of weightings. A high star-rating weatherboard house with ceramic tiles and wooden floor, and skillion flat roofing was the best design if the weighting of all five objective functions were equal. A house designed with these optimal wall, floor and roofing had a much higher rating (by 1. 3 stars), lower environmental impacts (by 10 - 20 %) for the same life cycle cos...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{qualitative}} research {{study was to explore}} how families with children with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) were able to move through the adverse situation that they face while raising a child with significant developmental needs and challenges. The theoretical framework that guided this phenomenological research was family resilience. The research participants included 14 parents of at least one child with an ASD. The age range of the participants ranged from 30 to 65, and they all resided in a large metropolitan area. A face-to-face interview was conducted with each of the participants in their own home or in a private setting. Participants were asked one question: Please tell me about your experience of raising a child with an ASD. The interviews were audiotaped, transcribed verbatim, and analyzed to determine themes. Eight themes emerged: (a) <b>balancing</b> <b>life</b> around the child with ASD; (b) remaining watchful and alert; (c) reaching a point of acceptance; (d) dealing with judgment; (e) gaining support; (t) relying on spirituality and faith; (g) learning to laugh; and (h) celebrating small successes. Conclusions, implications, and recommendations for future studies were reported in an effort to aid family therapists, school staff, and other mental health professionals in providing supports and resources to families with children with ASD.

40|$|Relevance for {{occupational}} science Occupational science studies patterns of occupation; habits, routines, and lifestyle. There {{has never been}} a theoretical model or measure of occupational patterns for scientists to use as a baseline for research. This presentation describes a theoretical model and measure of <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> useful for future research in occupational science. If <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> is a valid and unique construct, worthy of study, with potential implications for individuals, family and societal well-being, then the construct needs to be a clearly defined and conceptualized and {{there needs to be a}} way to measure it for additional research. The conceptualization of <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> used for this study originates from the lifestyle balance model (LBM) proposed by Matuska and Christiansen (2008). The model has some validity evidence when analyzed with women who have multiple sclerosis (Matuska 2 ̆ 6 Erickson, 2009), women with stress-related disorders (Håkansson 2 ̆ 6 Matuska, 2010), and with healthy working adults who also suggested financial security as a component to <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> (Wagman, Håkansson, Matuska, Björklund, 2 ̆ 6 Torbjörn, in press). I will describe a revised model of <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> and the construct validity evidence of both the revised model and a new measure of <b>life</b> <b>balance,</b> the <b>Life</b> <b>Balance</b> Inventory (LBI). <b>Life</b> <b>balance</b> is conceptualized as both congruence among desired and actual time spent in activities, and equivalence in the degree of discrepancy between desired and actual time spent across activities that meet health, relationship, challenge/interest and identity needs. Structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships between <b>life</b> <b>balance,</b> perceived stress, personal well-being, and need satisfaction. Four hundred and fifty eight participants representing mixed demographic groups participated in the study by completing 4 instruments. SEM results indicated that congruence, moderated by equivalence predicted lower stress, higher personal well-being and higher need satisfaction, but equivalence alone did not. Working, having children at home, and being non-white negatively moderated congruence and larger family size positively moderated congruence. This study provides initial construct validity evidence for the model and measure of <b>life</b> <b>balance.</b> Discussion questions: How does the concept of <b>life</b> <b>balance</b> relate to other aspects of well-being or health?
