25|$|Now {{in one of}} my {{earliest}} tunes, “New Orleans Blues,” you can notice the Spanish tinge. In fact, if you can’t manage to put tinges of Spanish in your tunes, you will never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> right seasoning, I call it, for jazz—Morton (1938: Library of Congress Recording).|$|E
25|$|Under Graham Taylor, many speculated his old {{mentor and}} manager at Watford would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> {{best out of}} him, but his form was to become even less consistent; {{although}} this may have partly been down to the decline of English football as a whole during this period. In Graham Taylor's first match as England Manager (against Hungary), Barnes had appeared to be attacking positively and beating players and using the ball well. This was a false dawn however and throughout a difficult time for the England squad, Barnes had few other highlights {{with the exception of}} scoring a stunning free kick against the Netherlands in a 1994 World Cup qualifying match.|$|E
25|$|Troy Percival was {{activated}} {{from the}} disabled list on September 2. In Toronto for his second outing since his return, he allowed a walk-off grand slam with two outs when the Rays were ahead by a single run and in position {{to win the game}} in extra innings. Against Boston during another extra inning game, Percival came in to close with a three-run lead and allowed the first three batters to reach base. He was removed from the game in favor of Jason Hammel, who had never recorded a save at the MLB level, and was the only remaining reliever available for the Rays in the game due to its length. Hammel converted the save opportunity, but many questioned if Percival should remain as the team's closer. The reason for Percival's removal from the game against Boston was a stiff back, and not for the game's situation, or for any sort of leg injury that had plagued him throughout the year. Percival stated that because of warming up multiple times throughout the game, only to not come in until the Rays took a lead, was what pained his back. Percival acknowledged that he knew he didn't feel well, and that he should have called for his own removal, but decided that with the lead the Rays had, he would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> job done. As a result of the game, the Rays decided to not use Percival too often on consecutive nights, and using him in a tie game if the situation of the game changes while he is warming up. He would still be listed as the team's closer.|$|E

25|$|The two started wearing {{identical}} {{outfits and}} develop the ”Fun loving pretty boy” gimmick they would be known for throughout their time together. After wrestling on {{the lower end of}} the card to get the fans familiar with the team the Midnight Rockers soon moved onto a feud with the team of Doug Somers and Buddy Rose who at the time were one of the top teams in the promotion. Their initial outing with Somers and Rose at the WrestleRock stadium show on April 20, 1986 did not go well for Jannetty and Michaels who lost in front of 22,000 fans. When Somers and Rose beat Scott Hall and Curt Hennig for the AWA World Tag Team Championship the Midnight Rockers suddenly found themselves chasing the main tag team title of the promotion. The Midnight Rockers teamed up with Curt Hennig to defeat Somer, Rose and Alexis Smirnoff at ”Battle by the Bay” on June 28, 1986 to prove that they were indeed capable of beating the champions. The Midnight Rockers would repeatedly challenge Somers throughout the rest of 1986 but never quite <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> win when the title was on the line. Finally near the end of that year, Jannetty and Michaels defeated the champions in a ”non-title” Steel cage match on December 25, 1986 on the AWA’s ”Brawl in St. Paul” show. A month later on January 27 1987 the Midnight Rockers defeated Rose and Somers for the AWA Tag Team title. Jannetty and Michaels realized that the AWA was a promotion in decline, in fact it would shut down completely by 1990, and they decided that their best bet was to work for the WWF. The Midnight Rockers got an offer from Vince McMahon while holding the AWA Tag Title. The Midnight Rockers even signed with the WWF while still holding the gold, necessitating the quick title change to the unproven duo of Boris Zhukov and Soldat Ustinov on May 25, 1987.|$|E
500|$|Schafer {{has pointed}} out that there are music term {{inspired}} attacks, such as a [...] "Face-Melting" [...] guitar solo, which literally will melt the foe's faces off. The metal/motorcyclist lifestyles and Norse mythology also inspired the game's open-world environments, such as amps carved into the face of a mountain, a forest where tires replace leaves, giant axes and swords piercing the ground, spandex covered temples, and mining facilities where human slaves excavated car and motorcycle parts. However, Schafer noted that they attempted to make sure that non-metal fans would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> jokes as well.|$|E
500|$|With Singer busy {{preparing}} X2, Confessions was rejuvenated with Clooney {{taking over}} as director. Miramax Films agreed to cover distribution duties and co-finance the film. In the end, funding for Confessions came from Miramax, Clooney's own Section Eight Productions, Village Roadshow Pictures, producer Andrew Lazar's Mad Chance, Allied Filmmakers, and The Kushner-Locke Company. Clooney explained, [...] "I thought if I {{came on board}} as a director, for scale, {{and was able to}} bring everybody else on inexpensively, if I could get the film back down to $30 million, then I was going to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> film made.

He could have played quarterback fine, but his enunciation wasn't clear {{enough for him to}} call the plays." [...] Heisman recalled how Strupper overcame the obstacle posed by his deafness: [...] "He couldn't hear anything but a regular shout. But he could read your lips like a flash. No lad that ever stepped on a football field had keener eyes than Everett had. The enemy found this out the minute he began looking for openings through which to run the ball." [...] He was nominated though not selected for an Associated Press All-Time Southeast 1869–1919 era team.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] was {{directed}} by Alex Courtes and Martin Fougerol. Shot at General Motors Place in Vancouver, British Columbia on 27April 2005, the video included additional footage from the band's Vertigo Tour concert of 28April. Planning for the project began as soon as U2 became aware the arena was available (a result of the NHL lockout of 2004–2005). Manager Paul McGuinness believed selecting Vancouver as the filming location {{made a lot of}} sense, saying, [...] "t's a world-renowned production centre. We knew we'd <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> crews and camera people and equipment here." [...] Members of the public were invited {{to be part of the}} video via radio and internet announcements. Word of the shoot leaked before the official announcement, which led to fans lining up outside for the entire day. Between 3,000 and 5,000 people were allowed in for the filming. During the shoot, U2 performed [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] multiple times, followed by [...] "Vertigo," [...] "All Because of You" [...] and [...] "Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 1991 Edinburgh Festival Fringe, Harries {{personally}} {{bought the}} television rights to An Evening with Gary Lineker, a comedy play written by Arthur Smith and Chris England based around {{a group of}} England fans at the 1990 FIFA World Cup. Smith bet Harries £100 {{that he would not}} <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> adaptation on television before the next World Cup. Harries tried selling Smith and England's screenplay to the BBC, Channel 4, LWT, Yorkshire Television and Central Independent Television to no avail. The BBC offered to produce it as a studio play but Harries wanted a full-length film to distinguish it from the original play, which was by then playing at London's West End. He was reluctant to offer the script to Granada because of his previous experience with the company. However, in 1992 he was accepted the position of controller of comedy at Granada and An Evening with Gary Lineker was made. Harries was disappointed that pressure from Granada's management had forced him to replace so many of the original stage cast; England was replaced by Paul Merton, leaving Caroline Quentin as the only original actor. The Edinburgh Fringe {{played an important role in}} Harries' early commissions at Granada; he was not fond of traditional styles of comedy and was always looking for alternative comedians. These included Caroline Aherne, Steve Coogan and John Thomson (though Coogan [...] "got away" [...] from him after the BBC offered to produce his Alan Partridge shows). After the failure of Bhundu Beat, Harries commissioned Peter Morgan to write [...] "Mickey Love" [...] in 1993, one of a series of short comedy films for the Rik Mayall series Rik Mayall Presents.|$|E

500|$|The Eriksson {{brothers}} and Johansson used the programming language BASIC {{to create the}} game, which Kimmo called noteworthy: it was considered impossible to write big programs in BASIC, and The Cottage was [...] "gigantic". The reason for their choice in programming language {{was that it was}} the only one all three knew beforehand; Kimmo said that they would no longer have chosen BASIC if they had programmed The Cottage in 1986, as they had access to many more programming languages by that time. According to Johansson, another reason was [...] "pure defiance" [...] towards the Eriksson brothers' father, who had told them they would never <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> game running if they programmed it in BASIC. Johansson said that the most challenging aspect of the development was getting the game to understand the Swedish language; to keep the size of the game's command interpreter [...] "reasonable", they decided to limit it to two-word commands. Acknowledging that different people use different words for things, they play-tested it with friends and family, writing down all attempted commands and deciding what the game should be expected to understand. During a short period of the game's development, the developers also logged all actions players at QZ had taken that the command interpreter had not understood; based on this data, they improved the interpreter and changed the outcomes to certain actions. At one point, the Eriksson {{brothers and}} Johansson took a two-year break from the game, but eventually returned to it and finished it in 1979. At this point, the only ways to play the game were by using a computer terminal in a university or by connecting to Oden via a modem.|$|E
500|$|Insane Clown Posse {{sued the}} FBI, whose National Gang Intelligence Center listed Juggalos as [...] "a loosely {{organized}} hybrid gang" [...] in a 2011 report. The report states that Juggalos are [...] "recognized as a gang in only four states... {{law enforcement officials}} in at least 21 states have identified criminal Juggalo sub-sets". The report also noted that New Mexico was {{seeing a lot of}} Juggalo gang expansion due to their attraction to [...] "the tribal and cultural traditions of the Native Americans". The lawsuit asks for the documents that the FBI used to reach this conclusion; in August 2013, federal authorities had [...] "filed a motion to dismiss the case, saying they had already released several news media reports about Juggalos involved in criminal activity". The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan is working with ICP's lawyers in order [...] "to ensure the right of Juggalos everywhere to gather together and express their support of the I.C.P. without having to worry about being unfairly targeted and harassed by law enforcement". On January 8, 2014, Insane Clown Posse, along with the American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan, filed suit again against the FBI. The suit aims to have Juggalos no longer considered to be a gang and to have any [...] "criminal intelligence information" [...] about Juggalos destroyed. ICP announced in the edition of December 21, 2012 of the Hatchet Herald that they will be releasing a sideshow EP to The Mighty Death Pop! in 2013. After no word was heard on the album, it was speculated that it had been scrapped. In mid 2013 it was announced that ICP would be releasing their first ever box set titled The First Six. After the release date came and passed, The First Six was not released. In a February 2014 interview with Faygoluvers, the question was asked if we would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> box set. ICP thought it had already been released. Dog Beats (the first ever release on Psychopathic Records) was set to be the bonus album in the box set, ICP went back and decided to put House of Wax in the box set instead. The First Six was set to be released on October 28, 2014. After a minor setback, was ultimately released on November 25, 2014.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} get the {{submarine}}'s price down to $2 billion per submarine in FY-05 dollars, the Navy instituted a cost-reduction program to shave off approximately $400 million of each submarine's price tag. The project was dubbed [...] "2 for 4 in 12," [...] referring to the Navy's desire to buy two boats for $4billion in FY-12. Under pressure from Congress, the Navy opted to start buying two boats per year in FY-11, meaning that officials would not <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> $2billion price tag before the service started buying two submarines per year. However, program manager Dave Johnson said at a conference on 19 March 2008 that the program was only $30million away from achieving the $2billion price goal, and would reach that target on schedule.|$|E
2500|$|The company's first {{studio was}} {{located on the}} roof of 841 Broadway at 13th St. in Manhattan, known then as the Hackett Carhart Building and today as the Roosevelt Building. The set-up was similar to Thomas Edison's [...] "Black Maria" [...] in West Orange, NJ, with the studio itself being mounted on {{circular}} tracks to <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> best possible sunlight (as of 1988 the foundations of this machinery were still extant). The company moved in 1906 to a converted brownstone mansion at 11 East 14th St. near Union Square, a building that was razed in the 1960s. This was Biograph's first indoor studio, and the first movie studio in the world to rely exclusively on artificial light. Biograph moved again in 1913, as it entered feature film production, to a new state-of-the-art studio on 175th Street in the Bronx.|$|E
2500|$|Preventing {{stolen bases}} by {{throwing}} to second base or third base to allow an infielder to tag a baserunner attempting {{to reach the}} base. A catcher who {{is very good at}} preventing stolen bases is said to have a low stolen-base percentage; a poor one has many bases stolen while he catches. (A pitcher who is slow to deliver is often more at fault for stolen bases than the catcher is.) Ideally, a catcher should <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> ball from his glove to that of the player covering second base in under two seconds. This is referred to as a catcher's [...] "pop time", the time elapsing between the popping sound of the pitch striking the catcher's mitt and the similar pop when the ball arrives at the glove of the fielder covering second base.|$|E

[...] The Club also had to repair the sidewalk that it needed to go through after it was done and generally clean up the site.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the week}} of episodes from 16 to 20 July, Kat's lover rents a flat for them to share. Inside Soap {{wondered}} {{if this was the}} biggest clue so far, saying it suggests he has access to money, because flats in London are not cheap. They said it might seem familiar, as Max has rented flats before for his lovers Stacey (when cheating on Tanya), and Tanya (when cheating on Vanessa Gold (Zöe Lucker)). They said Derek also [...] "wouldn't think twice about flashing his cash" [...] and opined that Jack would probably be able to afford it as well.

Kate White from Inside Soap later opined that Michael would <b>be</b> <b>able</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> money for the flat as he got Janine to tear up their prenuptial agreement. In relation to the flat, Soaplife focussed on Ray following the dance between him and Kat, and thought that if it was him, then he is [...] "either a secret millionnaire or EastEnders hasn't thought this one through." [...] Soaplife also used this to rule Jack out, as he has his own flat and would not need to rent one.|$|E
