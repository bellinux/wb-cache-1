40|$|Elucidation of {{underlying}} cellular and molecular mechanisms is pivotal to the comprehension of biological systems. The suc-cessful progression of {{processes such as}} pregnancy and parturition depends on the complex interactions between numerous biological molecules especially within the uterine microenvironment. The tissue- and stage-specific expression of these bio-molecules is intricately linked to and modulated by several endogenous and exogenous factors. Malfunctions may manifest as pregnancy disorders such as preterm labour, pre-eclampsia and fetal growth restriction that are major contributors to maternal and perinatal morbidity and mortality. Despite the immense amount of information available, our understanding of several aspects of these physiological processes remains incomplete. This translates into significant difficulties in the timely diagnosis and effective treatment of pregnancy-related complications. However, the emergence of powerful mass spectrometry-based proteomic techniques capable of identifying and characterizing multiple proteins simultaneously has added {{a new dimension to}} the field of biomedical research. Application of these high throughput methodologies with more conventional techniques in pregnancy-related research has begun to provide a novel perspective on the <b>biochemical</b> <b>blueprint</b> of pregnancy and its related disorders. Further, by enabling the identification of proteins specific to a disease process, proteo-mics is likely to contribute, not only to the comprehension of the underlying pathophysiologies, but also to the clinical diagno...|$|E
40|$|A new {{strategy}} for organocatalysis {{based on the}} <b>biochemical</b> <b>blueprints</b> of biosynthesis has enabled a new laboratory approach to cascade catalysis. Imidazolidinone-based catalytic cycles, involving iminium and enamine activation, have been successfully combined to allow a large diversity of nucleophiles (furans, thiophenes, indoles, butenolides, hydride sources, tertiary amino lactone equivalents) and electrophiles (fluorinating and chlorinating reagents) to undergo sequential addition with {{a wide array of}} α,β-unsaturated aldehydes. These new cascade catalysis protocols allow the invention of enantioselective transformations that were previously unknown, including the asymmetric catalytic addition of the elements of HF across a trisubstituted olefin. Importantly, these domino catalysis protocols can be mediated by a single imidazolidinone catalyst or using cycle-specific amine catalysts. In the latter case, cascade catalysis pathways can be readily modulated to provide a required diastereo- and enantioselective outcome via the judicious selection of the enantiomeric series of the amine catalysts. A central benefit of combining multiple asymmetric organocatalytic events into one sequence is the intrinsic requirement for enantioenrichment in the second induction cycle, as demonstrated by the enantioselectivities obtained throughout this study (≥ 99 % ee in all cases) ...|$|R
