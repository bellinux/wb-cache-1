Many other trophies and artifacts {{in the clubhouse}} melted or were damaged beyond repair but the Grey Cup survived by catching onto a nail when the shelf upon which it sat collapsed. The trophy has been broken on six other occasions: in 1978, when it was dropped by celebrating Edmonton Eskimos players; in 1987, when an Eskimos' player sat on it; in 1993, when Edmonton's Blake Dermott head-butted it; in 2006, when the trophy <b>broke</b> away from its base as the BC Lions celebrated their victory; in 2012 {{when one of the}} handles <b>broke</b> off as the Toronto Argonauts celebrated; and finally in 2014 when trophy <b>broke</b> from its base again by the Calgary Stampeders after their win.

40|$|This paper {{aimed to}} {{identify}} the vital factors that have contributed as the choice to the public to prefer Ar-Rahnu which {{is known to be}} Islamic pawn <b>broking</b> system popularly known {{to be one of the}} dominant pawn brokers in Malaysia. Realizing the need of Muslim community towards Islamic pawn <b>broking,</b> efforts were taken by certain authorities in making the Islamic approach in micro credit financing more feasible. Realizing the increasing popularity, relative usefulness and contribution of Islamic pawn <b>broking</b> as means for financial assistance, this paper proposed a comprehensive investigation by evaluating factors which influence the public to pursue the Islamic pawn <b>broking</b> (Ar Rahnu) compare to conventional pawn <b>broking.</b> Several identifiable variables were selected concerning storage charge, type of pawn item and customer service in measuring the main factors which influence the public to pursue the Islamic pawn <b>broking</b> (Ar-Rahnu) compare to conventional pawn <b>broking.</b> Using questionnaire as research instrument, 150 sets of questionnaires had been distributed to the customer at Ar-Rahnu MAIDAM Kuala Terengganu and other area in Kuala Terengganu. The result of the investigation demonstrated that all the identifiable constructs were substantial to very strong and significantly correlated with the main factors which influence the public to pursue the Islamic pawn <b>broking</b> (Ar Rahnu) compare to conventional pawn <b>broking</b> in Kuala Terengganu. The findings are symmetrical with the hypotheses formulated based on the previous studies and useful as one of the tools to strengthen the pawn <b>broking</b> system...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates how a web-hosted portal {{could be}} {{developed}} and designed in order to assist customer information updates in micro-enterprises in the ship <b>broking</b> business. Based on well-established system development theories and collected material, the web-hosted portal concept was developed. The development process included a case study at a ship <b>broking</b> company in Karlshamn, southern Sweden. Ship <b>broking</b> companies handle information as a mediator between other actors, thus the information becomes sensitive. In the ship <b>broking</b> business {{there is a constant}} need and flow of information. As the shipbrokers’ customers demand constant information 24 hours a day it is important to meet this demand in a service minded fashion. Today all customer updates are handled manually and are considered very time consuming and generate duplication of work. To solve these issues a possible solution could be to introduce information technology in the organisation. The introduction of information technology in the ship <b>broking</b> organisations has been slow. A contributing factor might be the widespread conservatism and resistance to changes in the ship <b>broking</b> business. The conclusions show the needs and demands for a web-hosted portal among shipbrokers and interested parties in the logistic chain. The result of the thesis should be considered as a foundation for further development and implementation of the concept...|$|R
