50|$|A rivet nut, {{also known}} as a <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> <b>nut</b> or {{threaded}} insert, is a one-piece internally threaded and counterbored tubular rivet that can be anchored entirely from one side. There are two types: one is designed to form a bulge on {{the back side of the}} panel as a screw is tightened in its threads. The other is similarly drawn in using a screw, but is drawn into the sleeve instead of creating a bulge.|$|E
40|$|A <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> <b>nut</b> is a {{mechanical}} fastener enabling a fast installation from one side. The setting process relies on plastic deformation due to axial compression of the rivet nut {{in such a}} way that a bulge is formed on the underside of the work piece. The mechanical performance of such a connection partly depends on the final geometry of the rivet nut after forming. In this contribution, the torque-to-turn resistance of an internally threaded round tubular rivet is studied with the aid of finite element techniques. A strategy is presented to simulate the setting process involving large plastic strains and contact pressures. An FE-based inverse method was used to identify the local plastic material properties of the <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> <b>nut.</b> The forming simulation was validated in terms of predicted shape of the rivet nut and the evolution of the setting force. A quasi-static FE model using the shape and solution variables of the deformed rivet nut was used to reproduce the torque-to-turn resistance as a function of the setting force. Finally, the aim is to apply the presented modelling strategy to explore innovative possibilities to increase the torque-to-turn resistance of a <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> <b>nut.</b> status: accepte...|$|E
40|$|In {{the work}} is {{presented}} the investigation of influence of fiber arrangement of a laminate on the values of stresses in the composite panel of a modified freight wagon using the FEM method. The conducted investigations concerned the reduced part of a side panel of a freight wagon. On this panel were mounted the tested composite panels. For this purpose, a special screw connection with a <b>blind</b> <b>rivet</b> <b>nut</b> was used. The first stage of works included manufacturing of a composite material consisting of four layers of a laminate. Each layer of the laminate is a composition of epoxy resin and carbon fibers with a plain weave in which fibers strands are woven at the angle of 90 °. In the next step it was changed the main angle of placement of fibers in all layers of the laminate. Wherein, all layers of the laminate were characterized with the same angle of fibers {{with respect to the}} global coordinate system used in the numerical test. As a result of the study it was observed the relationship between the main angle of fibers of the composite material and the values of stresses occurring in the composite plate...|$|E

40|$|The steel {{thin-walled}} {{structures are}} widespread in civil and industrial engineering nowadays. Self-drilling screws or rivets {{are used to}} interconnect thin-walled elements. <b>Blind</b> <b>rivets</b> and <b>nuts</b> as connectors are considered in the frames of this paper. Rivets have some benefits over self-drilling screws. They are: we can obtain more dense connection when using rivets. So we can increase bearing capacity of connection; a lower cost of riveted connection; a large variety of installation tools for riveted connection: manual, pneumatic, battery; side; an easy installation: access to the connected element is required only from one. These benefits provide increasingly growling popularity to rivets. In the paper 4 types of rivets are considered: combined (aluminum/steel) <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> zinc-coated steel <b>blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> stainless steel <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> and <b>blind</b> <b>nuts.</b> The features of each type of rivets are described in the paper. The influence on the behaviour of connections is revealed. The results of experimental research performed by the authors are presented in the paper. A bearing capacity shear of riveted connections is studied in the experiment. There are 3 types of riveted connections subjected to experiment: connection made by blind combined rivets; connection made by zinc-coated steel blind rivets; connection made by blind nuts. A connection between elements with significantly different thicknesses is modeled in the experiment. In reality this situation takes place, for example, in the roofing of buildings, where trapezoidal sheet can be fastened to purlin by rivets. As {{a result of the}} experiment the authors found out that the local deformations occuring under rivet head in the thick element significantly affect the behaviour and bearing capacity of the connection. That’s why the results of connection's bearing capacity obtained in tests were lower than the bearing capacity of rivet declared by manufacturers...|$|R

5000|$|While {{structural}} <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> using {{a locked}} mandrel are common, {{there are also}} aircraft applications using [...] "non-structural" [...] <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> where the reduced, but still predictable, strength of the rivet without the mandrel is used as the design strength. A method popularized by Chris Heintz of Zenith Aircraft uses a common flat-head (countersunk) rivet which is drawn into a specially machined nosepiece that forms it into a round head rivet, taking up much of the variation inherent in hole size found in amateur aircraft construction. Aircraft designed with these rivets use rivet strength figures measured with the mandrel removed.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Blind</b> <b>rivets,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as [...] "pop" [...] rivets (POP is the brand name of the original manufacturer, now owned by Stanley Engineered Fastening, a division of Stanley Black & Decker) are tubular and are supplied with a mandrel through the center. The rivet assembly is inserted into a hole drilled through the parts to be joined and a specially designed tool is used to draw the mandrel into the rivet. This expands the blind end of the rivet and then the mandrel snaps off. These types of <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> have non-locking mandrels and are sometimes avoided for critical structural joints because the mandrels may fall out, due to vibration or other reasons, leaving a hollow rivet that has a lower load-carrying capability than solid rivets. Furthermore, because of the mandrel they are more prone to failure from corrosion and vibration. Unlike solid <b>rivets,</b> <b>blind</b> <b>rivets</b> can be inserted and fully installed in a joint from only one side of a part or structure, [...] "blind" [...] to the opposite side.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Development and {{application}} of composite materials in modern industry are very dynamic. Composite materials seem to be replacing steel and aluminium ones. Composites are a cheaper solution, with similar mechanical strengths. Generally, {{there are two types}} of joints in composite structures: mechanical and adhesively bonded ones. The aim of the study was to determine the feasibility of riveted joints in composites materials. Static tensile test method was used. In the test there was used one type of glass fabric (Interglas 92140) from which two types of composite samples were prepared. In each sample there was used the same type of fiber with the same fiber orientation – 3 layers. Samples had dimensions of 220 x 100 mm and thickness of approximately 1. 5 mm. They were connected to each other with aluminium <b>rivet</b> <b>nuts</b> (from 1 to 3) and placed in a metal frame with a screw connection which was made of screws with nominal thread pitch M 5. Screws were tightened with constant torque. It was to provide an axial force to the sample during the tensile test. The frame was placed between cross-bars of tensile machine INSTRON 8516. The samples were stretched at a speed of 0. 05 mm/s at a distance up to 20 mm. During the tensile test displacement of the samples and pull force were registered. Depending on the fiber orientations and number of <b>rivet</b> <b>nuts</b> composite damage models were described. On the basis of the results the possibility of usage of aluminium <b>rivet</b> <b>nuts</b> connections in composite materials was determined...|$|R
