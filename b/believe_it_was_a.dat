5|$|Charles's wife, Isabeau of Bavaria, {{held the}} ball to honor the {{remarriage}} of a lady-in-waiting. Scholars <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> traditional charivari, with the dancers disguised as wild men, mythical beings often associated with demonology, that were commonly represented in medieval Europe and documented in revels of Tudor England. The event was chronicled by contemporary writers such as the Monk of St Denis and Jean Froissart, and illustrated {{in a number of}} 15th-century illuminated manuscripts by painters such as the Master of Anthony of Burgundy. The incident later provided inspiration for Edgar Allan Poe's short story Hop-Frog.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{scholars}} {{debate whether}} the Ming dynasty had sovereignty over Tibet. Some <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> relationship of loose suzerainty that was largely cut {{off when the}} Jiajing Emperor (r. 1521–67) persecuted Buddhism in favor of Daoism at court. Others argue that the significant religious {{nature of the relationship}} with Tibetan lamas is underrepresented in modern scholarship. Others note the Ming need for Central Asian horses and the need to maintain the tea-horse trade.|$|E

25|$|An SAS Sergeant {{died when}} the {{specialist}} unit raided a terrorist cell in Basra in November 2006. It was later determined {{that although the}} bullet was a ricochet and not a direct shot, {{it could have been}} friendly fire from his colleagues. However, forensic analysis of the round determined it was issued in 1994 and led investigators to <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> round that had disappeared along with five SA-80 rifles from the police station in Majar al-Kabir.|$|E

25|$|The next day, {{the class}} {{goes on a}} field trip to the {{laboratory}} of Dr. Norman Osborn, who is performing genetic experiments which involve splicing different gene traits from different animals together. He explains the need to speed up evolution ("D.I.Y. World") {{to make the world a}} more perfect place and shows off his prime specimen: a large female spider. Unfortunately, the spider is missing; it turns up moments later and bites Peter. The action is interrupted again by the Geek Chorus, who argue why Peter was bitten; some believe it was fate, some believe he was chosen by the spider, and some <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> case of him simply being in the spider's path.|$|E
25|$|Some people <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> {{military}} accident {{which was}} then covered up; there are records of parachute mines being tested by the Russian military {{in the area around}} the time the hikers were there. Parachute mines detonate a meter or two before they hit the ground and produce similar damage to those experienced by the hikers, heavy internal damage with very little external trauma. There were also glowing orbs reported in the sky in that general vicinity, possibly caused by such ordnance. This theory uses animals to account for the missing parts of Dubinina. People believe the bodies were moved; photos of the tent show that it was apparently erected incorrectly, something that these experienced hikers are unlikely to have done.|$|E
25|$|The Achaean {{forces are}} {{described}} in detail in the Catalogue of Ships, in the second book of the Iliad. They consisted of 28 contingents from mainland Greece, the Peloponnese, the Dodecanese islands, Crete, and Ithaca, comprising 1186 pentekonters, ships with 50 rowers. Thucydides says that according to tradition there were about 1200 ships, and that the Boeotian ships had 120 men, while Philoctetes' ships only had the fifty rowers, these probably being maximum and minimum. These numbers would mean a total force of 70,000 to 130,000 men. Another catalogue of ships is given by the Bibliotheca that differs somewhat but agrees in numbers. Some scholars have claimed that Homer's catalogue is an original Bronze Age document, possibly the Achaean commander's order of operations. Others <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> fabrication of Homer.|$|E

25|$|On 27 January 2014, it was {{reported}} that a relic of John Paul II, a vial containing drops of his blood, had been stolen from the church of San Pietro della Ienca north of L'Aquila in the mountainous Abruzzo region of central Italy, a region where he had loved to go on skiing vacations. Cardinal Dziwisz had previously given the vial to the church in recognition of its connections to the Pontiff. Because there are only three relics containing his blood, few or no other items were disturbed, and {{it would be difficult to}} sell, the investigating Italian police <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> commissioned theft, and speculated that the blood might be used in Satanic rites. The theft sparked a major search for the culprits. Two men confessed to the crime, and an iron reliquary and a stolen cross, but not the relic, were recovered from the grounds of a drug rehabilitation facility in L'Aquila on 30 January; the blood was recovered shortly after from rubbish bins near where the reliquary had been found.|$|E
500|$|On 1 April, {{pathology}} experts {{announced that}} Knut's immediate {{cause of death}} was from drowning.

500|$|Silent Civilian {{released}} {{their debut}} album Rebirth of the Temple on May 2, 2006. Blabbermouth.net reviewer, Scott Alisoglu, thought [...] "on virtually every track, the group meshes attacking riffs, searing solos, brutal drumming, and melody-drenched bombast". Although {{he did not}} <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> 'grand slam', {{he thought it was}} a [...] "pleasant surprise and strong first effort". Charlie Steffens of KNAC described the album as [...] "goddamn electric", while Greg Maki of live-metal.net awarded the album a perfect 10 out of 10 selecting it as his [...] "best album I have heard so far in 2006."

500|$|Indeed, as {{auxiliary}} {{forces of}} the British in Mandatory Palestine, several elements of the Arab Legion served in Palestine during the Mandate. The British had promised that these units would be withdrawn {{before the end of}} April, but for [...] "technical reasons", several companies didn't leave the country. John Bagot Glubb, the commander of the Arab Legion, formed them into one division with two brigades, each made up of two infantry battalions, in addition to several independent infantry companies. Each battalion was given an armored-car company, and the artillery was made into a separate battalion with three batteries. Another [...] "dummy" [...] brigade was formed to make the Israelis <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> reserve brigade, thus deterring them from counterattacking into Transjordan.|$|E
500|$|Grohl's first musical {{performance}} following {{the demise of}} Nirvana was performing with The Backbeat Band at the 1994 MTV Movie Awards in June, during which he was invited by Mike Watt {{to take part in}} his album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. After enjoying the performance, Grohl figured he could do his own musical project, which could work as [...] "some sort of cathartic therapy, to go out and record these songs that I'd written by myself." [...] Grohl afterwards booked six days at Seattle's Robert Lang Studios, which were located near his house, where he would record [...] "my favorite songs I had written in the past four, five years that no one had heard" [...] with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones, with whom he had recorded the demo tape Pocketwatch in 1992. The idea was to have Grohl playing all instruments and release it under a name that would make people <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> band, similar to Stewart Copeland's Klark Kent.|$|E

500|$|The Richard Riot {{has taken}} on a {{significance}} greater than a mere sports riot in the sixty years since it happened. The sight of French Quebecers rioting over the perceived slight to a Quebec cultural icon like Richard led many commentators to <b>believe</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> significant factor in Quebec's Quiet Revolution of the 1960s. Furthermore, the cause of the riot has been suggested not to be {{as a result of the}} severity of the suspension; what mattered was that the anglophone president of an anglophone league had suspended a Quebec player. French Canadians saw themselves as inherently disadvantaged within Canada and North America as a whole. Richard was seen as a hero by French Canadians, and almost a sort of a [...] "revenge" [...] against the anglophone establishment. The riot was a clear sign of rising ethnic tensions in Quebec. In an article published four days after the riot, journalist André Laurendeau was the first to suggest the riot was a sign of growing nationalism in Quebec. Entitled [...] "On a tué mon frère Richard" [...] (My brother Richard has been killed), Laurendeau suggested the riot [...] "betrayed what lay behind the apparent indifference and long-held passiveness of French Canadians".|$|E
