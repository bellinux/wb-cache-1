40|$|Bimodal {{interactions}} between relevant visual and tactile inputs can facilitate attentional modulation at early stages in somatosensory cortices to achieve goal-oriented behaviors. However, the specific contribution of each sensory system during attentional processing and, importantly, how these {{interact with the}} required behavioural motor goals remains unclear. Here we used EEG and event-related potentials (ERPs) {{to test the hypothesis}} that activity from modality-specific somatosensory cortical regions would be enhanced with task-relevant bimodal (visual-tactile) stimuli and that the degree of modulation would depend on the difficulty of the associated sensory-motor task demands. Tactile stimuli were discrete vibrations to the index finger and visual stimuli were horizontal bars on a computer screen, both with random amplitudes. Streams of unimodal (tactile) and crossmodal (visual and tactile) stimuli were randomly presented and participants were instructed to attend to one type of stimulus (unimodal or crossmodal) and responses involved either an indication of the presence of an attended stimulus (detect), or the integration and summation of 2 stimulus amplitudes using a pressure-sensitive <b>ball</b> (<b>grade).</b> Force-amplitude associations were learned in a training session, and no feedback was provided during the task. ERPs were time-locked to tactile stimuli and extracted for early modality-specific components (P 50, P 100, N 140). The P 50 was enhanced with bimodal (visual-tactile) stimuli that were attended to. This was maximal when the motor requirements involved integration of the 2 stimuli in the grade task and when the visual stimulus occurred before (100 ms) the tactile stimulus. These results suggest that visual information relevant for movement modulates early somatosensory processing and that the motor behavioral context influences this likely through interaction of top-down attentional and motor preparatory systems with more bottom-up crossmodal influences...|$|E

Wound balls are generally less viscous than solid core balls. The impact forces calculated from the model were compared to forces measured in impact tests at approximately 10 m/s.

Tne aim {{of this research is}} to examine how coordination in children develops and how to evaluate it practically. The method adopted to achieve this aim is first to make the boys and girls who are to be the subjects of the experiment throw a ball with all their might, and then have them try to throw it five times at the mark set at half the distance the ball covers at the first trial; the examiner measures the spaces between the mark and the points where the ball falls. In managing the discrepancy I have made use of the Discrepancy Index, DI=[numerical formula]. D_ 1 is excluded, because the first ball throwing is too often governed by chance. For the purpose of examining the relations DI bears to physical fitness and constitution panchi cards have been used. The result of this experiment shows that boys' superiority in this respetct to girls can be observed in every form, and that both boys and girls in lower forms have low DI value and make remarkable improvement in the third form. The sixth-form ability is about 67 % of that of adults, whom the girls in the same form surpass, boys' grading There can be found nothing noticable in the relations between physical constitution grading ability.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if there was a relationship between practice self-efficacy and game performance for football players. Self-efficacy can be described as task specific self-confidence. This was an exploratory study, there has been no previous research evaluating the relationship between practice self-efficacy and game performance for football players. However, previous research has evaluated confidence (self-efficacy) and its positive influence on performance, specifically within the sports realm (Gayton, Mathews & Burchstead, 1986, LaGuardia & Labbe, 1993, and Martin & Gill, 1995). This study also involves the aspect of practice and the theory of deliberate practice. There has been no research evaluating the relationship between deliberate practice and football performance. However, research has examined the influence of practice (deliberate practice) and performance in other sports. The amount of deliberate practice and performance have been shown to be directly related (Ericsson, et al., 1993). The participants in this study were a group of NCAA Division IA football players from a mid-western university (_N= 30). To address the {{purpose of this}} study, participants were asked to complete a task specific self-efficacy survey for football abilities; the football self-efficacy scale pertaining to specific practice sessions. The game performance was accessed using the <b>Ball</b> State Defensive <b>Grading</b> System.

40|$|A novel {{eccentric}} {{lapping machine}} {{was designed by}} the author and manufactured in-house, {{to serve as a}} test bench to investigate the finishing process parameters in relation to surface quality, as well as the feasibility of accelerating the finishing process of HIPed silicon nitride balls. The kinematics of the eccentric lapping were analysed and discussed. Taguchi Methods were used to optimise the finishing parameters to achieve maximum material removal rate in lapping and to achieve minimum surface roughness value Ra in polishing. Two kinds of HIPed silicon nitride ball blanks were finished by this machine. A finishing rate of 68 µm/hour was achieved which is 15 times higher than the conventional concentric lapping (normally 3 '- 4 µm/hour). The surface roughness and roundness of the polished <b>ball</b> were above <b>grade</b> 5, close to grade 3 precision bearing ball specification. The upper limits of lapping load and lapping speed were determined by aggressive lapping tests. The effects of various finishing parameters on the surface quality generated were studied by detailed surface analysis, including X-ray diffraction residual stress measurement. As a result, the relationship between the finishing process and surface quality has been established. Accelerated rolling contact fatigue tests were performed both under a standard 4 -ball and a modified 5 -ball rolling configuration, with a ceramic ball as the upper ball and steel balls as lower balls. The tests were conducted at high speed and lubricated conditions under different loads and were run for up to 135 - 200 million stress cycles. Tests were conducted on commercially finished balls with different surface roughness and with different surface integrity (heterogeneous porosity, star defect, grinding defect and C-cracks). Tests were also conducted on self-finished balls with different finishing parameters and with different surface roughness. After tests, the rolling tracks and failure areas were examined by detailed surface analysis. The residual stresses on the rolling tracks were measured. Finite Element Approaches were also employed to describe the contact stress status. Failure modes in relation to surface quality were discussed. The research has provided an understanding of the finishing process, surface quality and rolling contact fatigue behaviour of HIPed silicon nitride balls...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the influence of}} the firing conditions on the properties and microstructure of synthetic aggregate produced using granite quarry fine waste blended with low <b>grade</b> <b>ball</b> clay as the binder. The investigation involved the use of various engineering tests and microstructural characterization techniques with special attention on the evolution of the microstructure of the aggregate pellets upon firing. The raw materials were extruded and fired in a small bench top model Trefoil rotary kiln. Various temperature profiles were simulated and the effects of firing condition on the water absorption, relative density and mineralogical and microstructural evolution of the synthetic aggregate were investigated. Powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and electron microprobe analysis were used to study the phase transformation of the fired pellets produced using different firing conditions. Mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) and quantitative image analysis of backscattered electron (BSE) were employed to assess the pore structure of the synthetic aggregate. The main variables considered were the firing temperature and the duration at the highest temperature. An assessment of the microstructure at the coarse aggregate-cement paste interface is presented {{in the second part of}} this thesis. Concretes were cast with two different initial conditions of synthetic aggregate, i. e. dry and pre-wetted aggregate, and the results were compared with those obtained for the natural and Lytag lightweight aggregate concrete. This investigation was done with respect to the variables of hydration time, moisture condition of the aggregate particles and the type of coarse aggregate. Image analysis of backscattered electron image of flat and well-polished concrete samples was employed to provide quantitative information about the microstructural gradients at the coarse aggregate-cement paste interfaces. Finally, the influence of three different types of coarse aggregate on the permeability, compressive strength and elastic behavior of concrete was studied; the three aggregates were natural quartz, Lytag and the synthetic aggregate produced during this research. The results of the investigation show the significant influence of firing condition on the properties and mineralogical evolution of the synthetic aggregate. The microstructure of the synthetic aggregate was primarily controlled by two competing processes,i. e. pore growth and densification. Pore growth was observed when the aggregate was fired between 900 ° and 1, 110 °C, while densification started to overcome pore growth at about 1, 110 °C with a sintering time between 0 to 5 minutes. Densification of the synthetic aggregate depended on the amount of liquid phase that was associated with the melting of the feldspar mineral. The microstructural study shows that the moisture condition and type of coarse aggregate affects the microstructure of the interfacial transition zone (ITZ) between coarse aggregate and cement paste matrix. The results confirm the benefit of absorbing water from the surrounding paste by the porous aggregate on the ITZ microstructure unless too much and/or too rapid absorption of water occurs. Preferential deposition of calcium hydroxide was observed at the region close to the interface of quartz and synthetic aggregate that had a dense microstructure but very little deposition or build up was found for the porous synthetic aggregate. The Lytag and synthetic aggregate concretes showed a higher permeability than the natural quartz aggregate concrete. These results indicate the negative influence of the oven-dried technique that is commonly used in sample preparation, which might generate microcracks inside the tested samples. The 28 -day compressive strengths achieved ranged from 37 to 44 N mm 2 and compared favourably with control concretes made with the natural quartz or Lytag lightweight aggregates. The elastic modulus of the synthetic and Lytag lightweight aggregate concrete appeared to be about 30 to 40 percent lower than the natural aggregate concrete.
