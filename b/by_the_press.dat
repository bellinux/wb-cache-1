5|$|Applewhite and Nettles {{feared that}} they would be assassinated, and taught their {{followers}} that their deaths would be {{similar to those of the}} two witnesses of the Book of Revelation.

Applewhite and Nettles later explained to their followers that the former's treatment <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>press</b> was a form of assassination and had fulfilled their prophecy. Applewhite took a materialistic view of the Bible, seeing it as a record of extraterrestrial contact with humanity. He drew heavily from the Book of Revelation, although he avoided traditional theological terminology and took a somewhat negative tone towards Christianity. He only lectured about a small number of verses and never tried to develop a system of theology.|$|E
5|$|Chandler {{remained}} in the Senate for several months after his election as commissioner {{because he wanted to}} cast his vote on the Bretton Woods Monetary Agreement and the Charter of the United Nations.

Many owners believed Chandler had been attending a political meeting; the actual cause of his delay was his attendance at a Detroit Athletic Club luncheon, where he was representing Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|Charles Cardell (1892–1977) was {{the founder}} of a Pagan Witchcraft {{tradition}} that rivalled that of Gerald Gardner's in southern England during the 1950s.

Having been involved with Spiritualism as well as Pagan Witchcraft, Cardell initially befriended Gardner, but in 1958 they had an argument, and in 1964 Cardell tried to discredit him by publishing much of the then-secret Gardnerian Book of Shadows.|$|E
