5|$|Butler (Sarah-Jane Redmond) is {{introduced}} as the hybristophilic {{wife of a}} serial killer pursued by Black; when the killer is murdered, Black realizes that Butler has been hiding her own murderous past. His attempts to track her lead to Bob Bletcher's death and Butler's escape. Butler is revealed as a demon, capable of changing form on a whim. She later reappears as a succubus, sexually assaulting <b>Black</b> <b>in</b> his sleep to frame him for rape and (as a large snake) trying to kill Emma Hollis. Although both ploys are foiled, Butler escapes.|$|E
5|$|Domestic American {{alligators}} {{range from}} long and slender to short and robust, possibly due to variations in {{factors such as}} growth rate, diet, and climate. American alligators have broad snouts, especially in captive individuals. When the jaws are closed, {{the edges of the}} upper jaws cover the lower teeth which fit into the jaws' hollows. Like the spectacled caiman, this species has a bony nasal ridge, though it is less prominent. The teeth number 74–80. Dorsally, adult American alligators may be olive, brown, gray, or <b>black</b> <b>in</b> color, while their undersides are cream-colored.|$|E

5|$|Monk seals have {{a slender}} body and are agile. They have a broad, flat snout with {{nostrils}} on the top. Monk seals are polygynous, and group together in harems.

5|$|Muskrats {{are covered}} with short, thick fur, which is medium to dark brown or <b>black</b> <b>in</b> color, with the belly a bit lighter (countershaded); as the age increases, it turns a partly gray in color.

They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique to them. When they walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} aspects of Landis's commissionership is the question of race. From 1884, black ballplayers were informally banned from organized baseball. No black ballplayer played in organized baseball during Landis's commissionership; Rickey (then running the Brooklyn Dodgers) broke the color line by signing Jackie Robinson to play for the minor league Montreal Royals in 1946, after Landis's death; Robinson became the first <b>black</b> <b>in</b> the major leagues since the 19th century, playing with the Dodgers beginning in 1947.|$|E

40|$|This book {{is part of}} {{a growing}} list of {{published}} materials on the prospect and dilemma of <b>black</b> urban life <b>in</b> America. Drawing from the experiences of <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> six Southern cities, In Search of the New South is essentially concerned with the status of <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> the South between 1970 and 1980. While some qualitative changes have been noted, the book, as a whole, paints a bleak picture about the condition of <b>blacks</b> <b>in</b> the South. In fact, if one were to use the time-worn argument of the glass half-filled with water, {{it is clear that the}} authors have followed the half-empty glass approach...|$|R

5|$|The {{cephalothorax}} of Z.sexpunctatus is {{bronze to}} <b>black</b> <b>in</b> color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the cephalothorax is box-like in shape, being widest at the posterior lateral eyes. Numerous white or pale blue scales cover the clypeus ("face") and chelicerae. This covering extends around {{the sides of}} the carapace, ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang.|$|E

5|$|Zygoballus sexpunctatus is {{a species}} of jumping spider which occurs in the southeastern United States {{where it can be}} found in a variety of grassy habitats.

The male has distinctive enlarged chelicerae (the mouthparts used for grasping prey) and front femora (the third, and typically largest, leg segments).
