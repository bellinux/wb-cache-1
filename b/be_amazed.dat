25|$|Her primary interest, though, was her musical work. After {{joining forces}} with fellow musician, Norah Chambers, a {{graduate}} of the Royal Academy of Music in London, the pair formed a camp choir. Dryburgh wrote down pages of music from memory, from baroque to contemporary, for the Vocal Orchestra to perform, as well as pieces of her own light classical compositions. The music was arranged in four parts, which were hummed by the women to give the effect of an orchestra, and included pieces by Handel, Chopin, Brahms and Beethoven. Even the Japanese soldiers were said to <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> at what they heard, inviting themselves to the concerts. The Captives' Hymn was one of the pieces written by Dryburgh, and was sung each Sunday during church services.|$|E
25|$|There {{will be a}} lot {{of sympathy}} for Watkins when he takes the field tomorrow. His {{selection}} was not 24-hours-old when it was fiercely assailed by a former Australian Test captain who advocated eleventh hour reconsideration by the Test selectors. Happily, Messrs Harvey, Loxton and Ridings know their own minds and stuck to their decision so Watkins will have his big chance tomorrow against an array of experienced batsmen of the highest class, who have been playing good spin bowling since they left school. Those who watched Watkins' performance at the MCG for NSW against Victoria at Christmas do not agree with the pundits who have criticised his selection. Very simply, we have no Maileys, no Grimmetts, no O'Reillys. Our best spinner is Ashley Mallett, who cannot go to the Caribbean and is therefore omitted tomorrow. Watkins is, at least, as well worth a punt as anyone else and would <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> if the selectors confine him to the 12th man role.|$|E

25|$|In Brunei Sultanate, {{many of the}} Muslim {{subjects}} of the Sultan were converts from local Dayak groups. Acculturation had also taken place in Sarawak and Northern Borneo (modern day Sabah), where Brunei Sultanate and by the 18th century the Sulu Sultanate were collecting products for China and other markets, and establishing a fairly loose, river based governmental presence. Dayak chiefs were incorporated into the Brunei hierarchy, being given Malay titles such as Datuk, Temenggong and Orang Kaya. What had once been independent villages were gradually built into wider units, and their leaders co-opted into {{the hierarchy of the}} polity. A colonial writing about Sarawak, observed that many non-Malays would <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> to learn {{the degree to which the}} present Malay population derives from the local native sources, and among the latter are Sea (Iban) and Land Dayaks (Bidayuh). In northeastern Borneo, the Bulungan Malays appear to be of Kayan origin. Further down the east coast, the Paser polity had extended its influence into the Barito-speaking Dayak, and some of these people became Muslim and were eventually referred to as 'Paser Malays'. In southern Borneo, the Malay-speaking Sultanate of Banjar had been pushing inland since the 17th century, bringing Dayaks into its Muslim culture. In the west, the development of such sultanates of Sambas, Sukadana and Landak tells a similar tale of recruitment among Dayak people.|$|E

Aviation author Graham Perry wrote that, after the crash, [...] "airworthiness design standards were changed so that the threads {{at either end of}} all such valves manufactured since are now made totally different from each other. Items like a non-return valve simply cannot now be assembled in the wrong sense." [...] Nevertheless, Perry wrote, [...] " [...] would <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> how many people have still tried {{to do so in the}} forty-seven years since, most realising their mistake after looking in the manual and quietly and ruefully thanking those who had gone before them and made it impossible." ...|$|E

500|$|Themistocles {{died with}} his {{reputation}} in tatters, a traitor to the Athenian people; the [...] "saviour of Greece" [...] {{had turned into}} the enemy of liberty. However, his reputation in Athens was rehabilitated by Pericles in the 450sBC, {{and by the time}} Herodotus wrote his history, Themistocles was once again seen as a hero. Thucydides evidently held Themistocles in some esteem, and is uncharacteristically flattering in his praise for him (see above). Diodorus also extensively praises Themistocles, going as far as to offer a rationale for the length at which he discusses him: [...] "Now {{on the subject of the}} high merits of Themistocles, even if we have dwelt over-long on the subject in this digression, we believed it not seemly that we should leave his great ability unrecorded." [...] Indeed, Diodorus goes so far as to say that [...] "But if any man, putting envy aside, will estimate closely not only the man's natural gifts but also his achievements, he will find that on both counts Themistocles holds first place among all of whom we have record. Therefore one may well <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> that the Athenians were willing to rid themselves of a man of such genius." [...] Since Diodorus's history includes such luminaries as Alexander the Great and Hannibal, this is high praise indeed. Plutarch offers a more nuanced view of Themistocles, with more of a critique of Themistocles's character. He does not detract from Themistocles's achievements, but also highlights his failings.|$|E
500|$|Landing near Constantinople, Calafia {{meets with}} other Moslem warrior leaders who {{were unable to}} remove King Amadis and his Christian allies from the city, and she tells them all to hold back and watch her manner of combatâ€”she says they will <b>be</b> <b>amazed.</b> The next morning, she and her women warriors mount their [...] "fierce beasts" [...] wearing gold armor [...] "adorned with the most {{precious}} stones", advancing to invest the city. Calafia orders the griffins forward and they, hungry from the long sea voyage, fly out and maul the city's defenders. Sating their hunger, the griffins continue to snatch Christian men in their claws and carry them high in air only to drop them to their deaths. The city's defenders cower and hide from the griffins. Seeing this, Calafia passes word to her Moslem allies that {{they are free to}} advance and take the city. The griffins, however, cannot tell Moslem from Christian; they can only tell man from woman. The griffins begin snatching Moslem soldiers and carrying them aloft, dropping and killing them. Calafia questions her pagan faith, saying, [...] "O ye idols in whom I believe and worship, what is this which has happened as favorably to my enemies as to my friends?" [...] She orders her woman warriors to take the city's battlements and they fight well, taking many injuries from arrows and quarrels piercing the soft gold metal of their armor. Calafia orders her allies forward to assist the Californians in battle, but the griffins pounce again, killing Moslem men. She directs the griffin trainers to call them off, and the griffins return to roost in the ships.|$|E

500|$|Paste {{magazine}} writer Brent Koepp {{called it}} [...] "another incredible episode" [...] {{and said the}} impending conflict between Walter and Gus [...] "has the makings of one of television's finest showdowns". He also said the script made good use of the supporting characters, and that the growing distance between Hank and Marie was particularly well handled. Matt Seitz of Salon.com compared [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to excellent third season episodes that had [...] "very few scenes and sequences but luxuriated in them, allowing the characters (and the viewer) time to experience the tiny eddies and currents of the moment". He also called an overhead shot of Walter standing outside Gus' house alone [...] "one of the best shots in the show's history". Tim Surette of TV.com especially praised the scene with Walter approaching Gus' house, writing: [...] "Breaking Bad has always been good at creating an air of tension, but now {{it seems as though}} the series has mastered it. He also said Paul's acting during Jesse's emotional breakdown [...] "ripped my heart out and shredded it to pieces". The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said the photography and direction during Jesse's party scenes was masterful: [...] "Here we are four seasons into Breaking Bad and I shouldn't still <b>be</b> <b>amazed</b> at the innovated visuals or perfectly honed sense of sound. These are masters at work, people." [...] Slate writers Jessica Grose and June Thomas both enjoyed the episode, although they found Walter's character increasingly difficult to sympathize with. Both praised the scene when Mike attacked Walter, while Grose especially enjoyed Aaron Paul's performance and Skyler's subplot.|$|E
