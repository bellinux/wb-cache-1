40|$|ABSTRACT: For years, civil {{engineers}} {{have been in}} search for alternatives to steels and alloys to combat {{the high costs of}} repair and maintenance of structures damaged by corrosion and heavy use. In recent years there has been a marked increase in the use of fiber reinforced polymers (FRP) as structural elements in bridge construction. This is attributed to the advantageous properties of these materials, such as high strength to weight ratio, possibility of producing any shape, their high resistance to corrosion and fatigue, and easy maintenance. The current study utilizes the advancements in the three dimensional weaving technology in developing an innovative FRP deck system that satisfy AASHTO HS- 20 performance specifications. This paper presents fiber reinforced polymeric bridge decks that utilize an innovative textile engineering 3 -D weaving technology to overcome the weaknesses of its predecessors. The produced panels encompassed continuity of reinforcing fibers in both the top and <b>bottom</b> <b>skins</b> as well as between the outer skin and the inner core. The primary in-plane fiber reinforcement is uncrimped due to the orientation of the weaving. The 3 -D fibers perform as through thickness reinforcement, provide additional resistance to crack propagation and eliminate delamination as a failure mode. The feasibility and implications of using the 3 -D weaving process for FRP bridge decks is demonstrated by testing three woven glass FRP bridge deck slabs under static loading conditions. Test results exemplified the importance of the structural attachment of the core components to the outer composite deck skins and demonstrated resistance of delamination of the core to the outer skins and within the skins...|$|R
40|$|The {{attachment}} joints {{are inevitable}} in any large structure like an airframe. Splicing is normally used {{to retain a}} clean aerodynamic surface of the wing skin. The wings {{are the most important}} lift-producing part of the aircraft. Wings vary in design depending upon the aircraft type and its purpose. The wing box has two crucial joints, the skin splice joint and spar splice joint. Top and <b>bottom</b> <b>skins</b> of inboard and outboard portions are joined together by means of skin splicing. Front and rear spars of inboard and outboard are joined together by means of spar splicing. The skins resist much of the bending moment in the wing and the spars resist the shear force. In this study the chord-wise splicing of wing skin is considered for a detailed analysis. The splicing is considered as a multi row riveted joint under the action of tensile in plane load due to wing bending. Stress analysis of the joint is carried out to compute the stresses at rivet holes due to by-pass load and bearing load. The stresses are estimated using the finite element approach with the help of PATRAN/NASTRAN. In a structure like airframe, a fatigue crack will appear at the location of high tensile stress. Further these locations are invariably the sites of high stress concentration. Life prediction requires a model for fatigue damage accumulation, constant amplitude S-N (stress life) data for various stress ratios and local stress history at the stress concentration The response of the splice joint will be evaluated. The splice joint is one of the critical locations for fatigue crack to initiate. In this study prediction of fatigue life for crack initiation will be carried out at maximum stress location...|$|R
