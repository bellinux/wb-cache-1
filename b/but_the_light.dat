Radio Caroline's audience was one third {{the size of the}} Light Programme in the parts of the country where it could be received, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Light</b> Programme's audience did not decrease, indicating that pirate radio appealed to an audience that the BBC did not serve.|$|E
5|$|The comb rows of most planktonic ctenophores {{produce a}} rainbow effect, {{which is not}} caused by {{bioluminescence}} but by the scattering of light as the combs move. Most species are also bioluminescent, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> is usually blue or green and can only be seen in darkness. However some significant groups, including all known platyctenids and the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia, are incapable of bioluminescence.|$|E

By daylight on 3 August, the German, Austrian and Ottoman force had occupied Katia and were {{within striking distance of}} Romani, Dueidar, Hill 70 and the Suez Canal.

5|$|There are two {{stations}} serving Summer Hill on the Dulwich Hill Line of Sydney's {{light rail}} network. These are - Lewisham West (adjacent {{to the former}} flour mill {{on the border with}} Lewisham) and Taverners Hill (near Parramatta Road). Access to the city is quicker by train, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> rail may be used for some cross-regional journeys.

5|$|WASP-44 was {{observed}} between July and November 2009 by the WASP-South, a station of the SuperWASP planet-searching program {{based at the}} South African Astronomical Observatory. Observations of the star revealed a periodic decrease in its brightness. WASP-South, along with the SuperWASP-North station at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on the Canary Islands, collected 15,755 photometric observations, allowing scientists to produce a more accurate light curve. Another set of observations yielded a 6,000 point photometric data set, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> curve was prepared late and was not considered in the discovery paper.|$|E
5|$|During {{the final}} days of Operation Goodwood Royal Navy {{planners}} decided not to order further Fleet Air Arm operations against Kaafjord. The planners accepted that the Germans were now able to cover Tirpitz in smoke before Barracudas could reach the battleship, and these aircraft could not carry bombs large enough to inflict heavy damage. Further consideration was given to attacking Kaafjord using Mosquitos launched from aircraft carriers, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> bombers continued to be in short supply and it was judged that they were not well suited to the task. Moreover, there was a growing need to transfer the carriers to the Pacific to strengthen Britain's contribution to the war against Japan.|$|E

In April 1780 the 64th {{was part of the}} covering force besieging Charleston, while the grenadier and light companies formed part of the main siege force. After the capture of Charleston, the grenadier and light companies were withdrawn to New York and as Major-General Cornwallis began to advance on Virginia, the 64th remained in Carolina as guard troops. In 1781 the 64th were involved in the Battle of Eutaw Springs and a year later in one of the last actions of the war, the Battle of the Combahee River. The grenadier company was reunited with the 64th <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> company was among the units that surrendered with Cornwallis at Yorktown.|$|E
5|$|The FIA {{doubled the}} Formula One engine {{capacity}} limit to 3litres for the 1966 season and suitable engines were scarce. Brabham used engines from Australian engineering firm Repco, {{which had never}} produced a Formula One engine before, based on aluminium V8 engine blocks from the defunct American Oldsmobile F85 road car project, and other off-the-shelf parts. Consulting and design engineer Phil Irving (of Vincent Motorcycle fame) was the project engineer responsible for producing the initial version of the engine. Few expected the Brabham-Repcos to be competitive, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> and reliable cars ran at the front {{from the start of}} the season. At the French Grand Prix at Reims-Gueux, Brabham became the first man to win a Formula One world championship race in a car bearing his own name. Only his former teammate, Bruce McLaren, has since matched the achievement. It was the first in a run of four straight wins for the Australian veteran. Brabham won his third title in 1966, becoming the only driver to win the Formula One World Championship in a car carrying his own name (cf Surtees, Hill and Fittipaldi Automotive). In 1967, the title went to Brabham's teammate, New Zealander Denny Hulme. Hulme had better reliability through the year, possibly due to Brabham's desire to try new parts first. The Brabham team took the Constructors' World Championship in both years.|$|E

25|$|Some of {{the least}} {{pleasant}} light comes from tubes containing the older, halophosphate-type phosphors (chemical formula Ca5(PO4)3(F, Cl):Sb3+, Mn2+). This phosphor mainly emits yellow and blue light, and relatively little green and red. In {{the absence of a}} reference, this mixture appears white to the eye, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> has an incomplete spectrum. The color rendering index (CRI) of such lamps is around 60.|$|E
25|$|LED lamps {{are used}} for {{flashing}} beacon lights on vehicles such as maintenance trucks. Previously, traditional light sources required the engine to continue running {{to ensure that the}} battery would not become depleted if the lights were to be used {{for more than a few}} hours. The energy-efficient nature of the LED source allows the engine to remain turned off <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> to continue to flash.|$|E

25|$|After an {{incident}} at the June 2015 Chicagoland Xfinity race where the pit flagman waved a green flag <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> {{at the end}} of pit road was red, NASCAR added a light {{to the rear of the}} pace/safety car to help inform drivers and teams when pit road will be open, and thus removed the flagman from the entrance of pit road. NASCAR's official policy is that in the event of a discrepancy, the light {{at the end of}} pit road is official.|$|E
25|$|The {{light was}} first {{proposed}} in 1881 {{and again in}} 1882. Tenders were called in 1883, and the lighthouse was constructed by W. P. Clark in 1885, a typical Queensland lighthouse built of a hardwood frame clad with galvanized iron plates. The light source and the apparatus were upgraded in 1923 and in 1934 respectively. The cottages were replaced in 1927. The station received electricity in 1950, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> remained kerosene operated until it was decommissioned in 1985. Reconstruction of the lighthouse at Mackay, where it stands today, took from 1989 to 1995. The lighthouse is accessible {{to the public and}} tours are available.|$|E
25|$|Albert Almoznino {{suggests}} {{to use a}} white or light-colored wall, sheet or table cloth for a small audience as in a private home. If a wall is dark-colored, the sheet or table cloth can be hung against it. If performing for a large audience such as in an auditorium or on a stage, he suggests a screen made of muslin or other thin cloth attached to a frame. In a nightclub, hall or small theater, he suggests a nylon screen on a pliable aluminum frame. It is a screen sometimes used for TV projection called a rear projection screen, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>light</b> must be stronger like a small spotlight without the projector, lenses, or diffusers, or a motion-picture projector with the front lenses removed.|$|E
