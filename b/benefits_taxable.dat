50|$|The Benefit Financing Model is {{composed}} of two programs. Program One, the Projection Program, {{is based on the}} methodology of empirical econometric modeling. It uses regressions to derive mathematical relationships between key UI variables, and projects UI <b>benefits,</b> <b>taxable</b> wages, as well as workload variables on quarterly basis twelve years into the future. Program Two, the Financial Forecast Program, is based on the methodology of simulation modeling. It estimates Unemployment Trust Fund (UTF) income by simulating the workings of the State's taxation system. Combined with the UTF outgo estimated by the Projection Program, the Financial Forecast Program is capable of projecting the dynamic flow of the Unemployment Trust Fund on quarterly basis under different economic and legislative scenarios. Furthermore, the Financial Forecast Program also assesses the adequacy level of the UTF under different scenarios and report solvency measures (such as Reserve Ratio, Average high cost multiple, etc.)on annual basis. If the trust fund should become insolvent and borrowing from the Federal Government is projected, the Program is able to assess loan interests, any reduced FUTA credits (also known as FUTA credit reduction), and other key loan variables. Lastly, the Projection Program can also be run independently to perform benefit cost estimation as well as workload forecasting.|$|E

50|$|During {{his first}} term, Butkovitz fought against his party's {{leadership}} to successfully repeal a tax requiring senior citizens to include social security, pensions, and veteran's <b>benefits</b> as <b>taxable</b> income. In November 2005, {{he was elected}} Philadelphia City Controller and resigned his legislative seat effective December 31, 2005.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, the Ministry of Justice {{considered}} legalising prostitution as {{an official}} occupation with health <b>benefits</b> and <b>taxable</b> income and held a public discussion on the topic. Legalisation and regulation was proposed {{as a means to}} increase tax revenue, reduce corruption, and improve the situation of the workers. However, nothing further was done.|$|R
25|$|The {{exemption}} of employer-sponsored {{health benefits}} from federal income and payroll taxes distorts {{the health care}} market. The U.S. government, unlike some other countries, does not treat employer funded health care <b>benefits</b> as a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> in kind to the employee. The value of the lost tax revenue from a benefits in kind tax is an estimated $150billion a year. Some regard this as being disadvantageous {{to people who have}} to buy insurance in the individual market which must be paid from income received after tax.|$|R
5000|$|The 1985 Budget {{made the}} {{benefits}} system fairer by introducing more generous income exemption limits and benefit abatement. Although <b>benefits</b> became <b>taxable,</b> the budget also gave price compensation to beneficiaries for {{the introduction of}} GST and included them in Family Support payments. Altogether, these measures meant that beneficiaries were actually better off on the introduction of GST and this in turn reduced inequalities.|$|R

25|$|A {{new feature}} of Incapacity Benefit was that {{officials}} {{could ask for}} claimants' disabilities to be confirmed using a bespoke testing procedure – the All Work Test – carried out by doctors working for the government. Another feature was that claimants would be assessed {{on their ability to}} do any job, not just their old trade. And unlike its predecessor, Incapacity <b>Benefit</b> was <b>taxable.</b> Nevertheless, the caseload continued to rise.|$|R
50|$|Since 1984 {{a portion}} of social {{security}} <b>benefits</b> are <b>taxable,</b> usually levied when a person has another source of income often from a separate pension/disability fund or from a spouse. State income tax laws generally exclude all social security <b>benefits</b> from <b>taxable</b> income. If social security disability and other public benefits provide more than 1/2 of an adult's cost of living, that person is not considered a dependent for establishing head of household filing status by a caregiver, although in practice, many taxpayers claim disability benefit recipient relatives. Private disability insurance income is taxable if the original premiums for the benefit were paid by the employer; if they were paid by the individual, they are not taxable. If both paid the premiums, they are taxable in the same proportion. Five states (California, New York, New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii) have mandatory state disability programs, but {{the structure of the}} programs vary widely. Tax treatment of California's program is especially complex, as California's program pre-dates the Social Security Act, resulting in numerous tax-law special rules.|$|R
50|$|Employee {{benefits}} and (especially in British English) {{benefits in kind}} (also called fringe benefits, perquisites, or perks) include various types of non-wage compensation provided to employees {{in addition to their}} normal wages or salaries. In instances where an employee exchanges (cash) wages for some other form of benefit is generally referred to as a 'salary packaging' or 'salary exchange' arrangement. In most countries, most kinds of employee <b>benefits</b> are <b>taxable</b> to at least some degree.|$|R
50|$|In Canada, honoraria are {{considered}} salary and thus, taxable income under the Income Tax Act. In {{the case where}} a gift is substituted for honorarium (gift in lieu of money), it is still classified as a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> by Canada Revenue Agency.|$|R
50|$|Servicemembers have {{different}} {{rules and regulations}} with regards to taxes that make child support a more complicated process. Because some military income and deployment <b>benefits</b> are not <b>taxable,</b> a court must decided to levy obligations based on pre-tax income or post-tax income.|$|R

30|$|The QUAD agreements, however, had one {{critical}} flaw: they made provision for any government to terminate their involvement with one year’s notice. Moreover, {{agreement on the}} need to establish a strong pan-Canadian ECEC system did not extend across all parties. Thus when a Conservative government was elected in January 2006, one of its first acts was to announce the termination of its involvement. Reflecting its neo-liberal, social conservative ideology, the Conservative government created the so-called universal child care <b>benefit</b> — a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> of $ 100 a month for each child under six, which would cost the government $ 2.4 billion per annum. The pre-tax amount for parents falls well short of the over $ 500 monthly fee for children over 18 months. Moreover, the benefit offered the most to upper income families with a single breadwinner (Battle, Torjman, & Mendelson, 2006).|$|R
30|$|The {{analysis}} {{uses the}} Central Register of Higher Education (CRIHO) which includes {{information about the}} subject of study, type of education (vocational college -HBO, or university -WO), institution of study, and month and year of graduation, in addition to basic personal characteristics such as age, gender and ethnicity. In addition, the study uses data about parental economic position in 1999 which comes from the Social Statistical Database (SSB). The SSB includes variables measuring relevant labor market characteristics of the parents (employment, <b>benefits</b> and <b>taxable</b> income). Both data-sets are derived from individual register data ensuring a high quality of measurement.|$|R

50|$|The Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) is a dataset from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) {{based on}} {{individuals}} {{who could be}} liable to tax.

Furthermore, SPI does not include income from non <b>taxable</b> <b>benefits</b> such as housing benefits or job seekers allowance.|$|R
5000|$|There is some {{evidence}} that consumers' decisions on fuel economy are not entirely aligned to the price of fuel. In turn, this can deter manufacturers from producing vehicles that they judge have lower sales potential. Other efforts, such as imposing efficiency standards on manufacturers, or changing the income tax rules on <b>taxable</b> <b>benefits,</b> may be at least as significant.|$|R
50|$|Premiums paid by {{employers}} to provide cover {{for their employees}} are tax-deductible as a business expense and are a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> to the employee. Benefit payments paid from the policy, following an accident or illness affecting the policyholder, are free of income tax and National Insurance contributions for individual policies. For group policies, benefits are paid as taxable and NIable earnings.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the extent to}} which changes in U. S. labour market policy in the 1980 s {{may have contributed to the}} emergence of an unemployment rate gap between Canada and the United States. In that decade, unemployment insurance <b>benefits</b> became <b>taxable,</b> income tax rates fell substantially, and various administrative changes were made that effectively tightened unemployment insurance eligibility requirements. These policy changes are evaluated in the context of a computable equilibrium model of the labour market. Our estimates suggest that all of these reforms together can account for no more than a 0. 4 percentage point decline in U. S. natural rate of unemployment; a combined effect which accounts for 20 percent of the unemployment rate gap. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{sunshine}} list is {{a listing}} of salary, benefit and severance information. In Canada, the list is commonly used for example by provincial or municipal governments to identify any publicly employed person making $100,000 salary or higher.

5000|$|According to Maclean's Magazine, Peter George was Ontario's highest paid {{university}} president and received over $500,000 in salary and <b>taxable</b> <b>benefits</b> in 2007.

5000|$|Reported cash values {{might seem}} to [...] "disappear" [...] or become [...] "lost" [...] when the death benefit is paid out. The {{reason for this is}} that cash values are {{considered}} to be part of the death benefit. The insurance company pays out the cash values with the death benefit because they are inclusive of each other. This is why loans from the cash value are not taxable as long as the policy is in force (because death <b>benefits</b> are not <b>taxable).</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{value of}} a vehicle bought by a company for the {{dedicated}} use of its staff is treated as a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> for that individual, and assessed by HMRC with other income for income tax purposes. Until 2002 their financial benefit was assessed primarily based on price and mileage driven; this was then modified so that vehicles with lower emissions were assessed at a lower value than those with higher emissions. In addition, the taxable allowance for mileage using private cars has remained static.|$|R
30|$|There {{are other}} {{additional}} powerful economic incentives reported in Table 1 that encourage the purchase {{and use of}} EVs within and outside of cities in Norway. These are as follows: (1) EVs are exempted from paying the numerous car ferry fares on the national road network, (2) EVs have only a 50  % <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> if used as a company car, (3) EVs are exempted from parking fees in all municipality-owned parking spaces, and (4) in municipality owned parking spaces, battery charging is free.|$|R

50|$|Employees {{participating}} in a Section 79 plan offered by a sponsoring corporation may receive up to $50,000 in group term life insurance at no cost, if the plan is non-discriminatory. Any amount over this limit is deemed a 'permanent benefit'. The employee should realize {{a portion of the}} permanent <b>benefit</b> as W-2 <b>taxable</b> income, and pay any applicable taxes accordingly. Contributions to a Section 79 plan are tax-deductible, though for owner(s), and 2% or more shareholders, contributions are only deductible if paid by, and from, a C Corporation.|$|R
50|$|Private {{healthcare}} {{has continued}} {{parallel to the}} NHS, paid for largely by private insurance, and is used by about 8% of the population (citation required), generally as an add-on to NHS services and mostly obtained by employer funded insurance schemes. That is a <b>taxable</b> <b>benefit</b> to the employee, the value imputed by the tax authorities as income to the beneficiary. Because NHS services are so comprehensive, there are many areas in which the private sector usually does not compete and private insurers almost always refuse to fund. Childbirth and perinatal services are good examples.|$|R
5000|$|Subsequent to the {{criminal}} trial of the Grillos, {{it was reported that}} both Saatchi and Lawson could be liable for employer tax contributions on the money used for the personal benefit of the two sisters. The money and other benefits could be considered <b>taxable</b> <b>benefits</b> in kind, that could potentially be subject to a 13.8% employer National Insurance contribution. [...] Also subsequently there were reports that the Grillos father, Michele Grillo had been arrested over an alleged conspiracy to sell [...] "large" [...] quantities of cocaine and cannabis.|$|R
40|$|Many {{employers}} provide domestic partner {{benefits to}} their employees, {{especially in the}} form of health care plans. Domestic partners are not considered spouses under the Internal Revenue Code. Nor, of course, are same-sex spouses so long as DOMA is in effect. Many employers assume that this means all domestic partner (or same-sex spouse) <b>benefits</b> are <b>taxable</b> under the federal tax law. But this is not true. A partner (or same-sex spouse) can qualify as a dependent and benefits paid to dependents are also tax-exempt. A person can qualify as a dependent for purposes of excluding the value of health care plans from income even if the person cannot be claimed as a dependent on the employee taxpayer’s return. This essay describes the applicable rules in some detail. It also provides a survey of colleges and universities that provide such benefits and analyzes how many of such employers are applying the wrong tax law to their employees...|$|R
5000|$|Contributions to a Roth IRA do {{not reduce}} a taxpayer's {{adjusted}} gross income (AGI). By contrast, contributions to a traditional IRA or most employer sponsored retirement plans reduce AGI. Reducing one's AGI has a <b>benefit</b> (besides reducing <b>taxable</b> income) if it puts the AGI below some threshold to make the taxpayer eligible for tax credits or deductions {{that would not be}} available at the higher AGI with a Roth IRA. The amount of credits and deductions may increase as the taxpayer slides down the phaseout scale. Examples include the child tax credit, the earned income credit, the student loan interest deduction.|$|R

50|$|If phantom {{stock or}} SARs are irrevocably promised to employees, it is {{possible}} the <b>benefit</b> will become <b>taxable</b> before employees actually receive the funds. A “rabbi trust,” a segregated account to fund deferred payments to employees, may help solve the accumulated earnings problem, but if the company is unable to pay creditors with existing funds, the money in these trusts goes to them. Telling employees their right to the benefit is not irrevocable or is dependent on some condition (working another five years, for instance) may prevent the money from being currently taxable, {{but it may also}} weaken employee belief that the benefit is real.|$|R
40|$|Before 1979, {{unemployment}} insurance (UI) benefits were not treated as taxable {{income in the}} United States. Several economists criticized this policy {{on the ground that}} not taxing UI benefits while taxing earned income allegedly encourages unemployed persons to conduct longer than socially optimal job searches. Since 1979, however, UI benefits received by persons in higher-income families have been subject to income tax. This paper investigates whether the introduction of benefit taxation has had the predicted effect of reducing unemployment duration. The study uses data on a sample of persons that filed for UI in 1978 or 1979 to examine whether high-income claimants collected benefits fo rshorter periods after the tax change than they did before <b>benefits</b> became <b>taxable.</b> As part of the empirical analysis, the paper develops a generalization of the Weibull distribution and applies a limited-dependent-variable technique for this distribution similar to the Tobit technique for the normal distribution. Despite some variation in the results from different model specifications, the analysis presents persuasive evidence of a tax effect on unemployment duration. The 1979 policy change is estimated to have reduced average compensated unemployment duration among the sampled high-income claimants by about one week. ...|$|R
