5|$|Due to {{the diverse}} range of {{accounting}} services and recent corporate collapses, attention has <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> ethical standards accepted within the accounting profession. These collapses {{have resulted in a}} widespread disregard for the reputation of the accounting profession. To combat the criticism and prevent fraudulent accounting, various accounting organizations and governments have developed regulations and remedies for improved ethics among the accounting profession.|$|E
5|$|For {{the human}} ear, {{it is often}} {{difficult}} to tell precisely where a cicada song originates. The pitch is nearly constant, the sound is continuous to the human ear, and cicadas sing in scattered groups. In addition to the mating song, many species have a distinct distress call, usually a broken and erratic sound emitted by the insect when seized or panicked. Some species also have courtship songs, generally quieter, and produced after a female has <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the calling song. Males also produce encounter calls, whether in courtship or to maintain personal space within choruses.|$|E
5|$|The {{highlight}} of the Nobel Prize Award Ceremony in Stockholm occurs when each Nobel laureate steps forward to receive the prize {{from the hands of}} the King of Sweden. In Oslo, the Chairman of the Norwegian Nobel Committee presents the Nobel Peace Prize {{in the presence of the}} King of Norway. At first, King Oscar II did not approve of awarding grand prizes to foreigners. It is said that his mind changed once his attention had <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the publicity value of the prizes for Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Claims {{to three}} lode mines {{and a single}} coal mine were made within the Goat Rocks Wilderness, but the United States Bureau of Mines has no record of {{production}} from any of these claims. Historically, two claims have actually been staked in the area, the Mosquito lode near Walupt Lake in 1934, and later, the Glacier lode near Packwood Glacier in 1939. Neither show evidence of assessment work, and both deposits are now abandoned. Miners may have <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the area by news of lode deposits containing gold, silver, and copper along breccia and shear zones {{to the north of}} the wilderness area.|$|E
5|$|I've always <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> her story. More than anything, {{drawn to}} her {{commitment}} to what she believed in. In the face of death, she did not back down. And that is a theme that resonates with me. And women need female role models like that. There's not a lot. I mean, she was {{burned at the stake}} after leading her country to victory, after defeating the English. I mean, the idea that instead of celebrating her, they called her a heretic because she was dressed like a boy, and how could this person, this one girl, be so victorious and so clever to have the strategy and knowledge to wage, and win, a war? There must be something wrong with her. OK, she's a witch. Now we have to destroy her. And she didn't back down, and I admire that.|$|E
5|$|Warner was an {{aspiring}} bluegrass musician (which was unusual in Australia) after {{learning of the}} music from his father, an early Australian bluegrass pioneer. The winner of the Australian National Bluegrass Mandolin Championship for four consecutive years, Warner had toured with country music artists including Gina Jeffreys, and with Young in Kasey Chambers's band. Young and Warner knew each other previously, and according to Warner, had <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> bluegrass and American roots music through an appreciation of George Jones and Merle Haggard. Warner and Young {{made the decision to}} emigrate to America to pursue musical careers in that country, after they met. Young and Warner later lived together in Sydney while trying to find work in the moribund Australian bluegrass scene. After leaving Australia, they spent time in West Texas before relocating to Austin.|$|E

5|$|With {{many players}} indisposed and his options limited, Allen {{requested}} reinforcements and the MCC sent out Len Hutton {{in time for}} the third Test; in the meantime, Allen asked S. C. Griffith, not a highly regarded batsman, to open the batting for England in the second Test. Griffith responded by batting the entire first day and scoring 140 runs in total, his maiden century in first-class cricket. The West Indies won the last two Tests (the first two having <b>been</b> <b>drawn)</b> <b>to</b> win the series; the MCC team did not win a single match on the tour. Allen later regretted accepting the invitation to lead the team. In three Tests, he scored 94 runs and took five wickets. Allen did not play any more Test cricket; in 25 matches, he scored 750 runs at an average of 24.19 and took 81 wickets at 29.37.|$|E
5|$|Danny Baranowsky, the game's {{composer}} and who previously worked with McMillen on Super Meat Boy, was involved early {{on with the}} project shortly {{after the completion of}} the first prototype. McMillen and Baranowsky worked back and forth, with McMillen providing artwork from the game and allowing Baranowsky to develop the musical themes based on that; this would often lead to McMillen creating more art to support the music as it progressed. Baranowsky had <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> The Binding of Isaac as though the game puts forth a dark tone, he stated it had rather silly undertones underneath and such that one could not take it too seriously. Some of the songs were inspired by classical choral music but modified to fit the theme of the game. Other works were inspired by boss fight songs composed by Nobuo Uematsu for the Final Fantasy series. Baranowsky also had additional time after finishing the main songs for the game to craft short additional tracks that were used for special rooms like shops and secret areas.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1994, Pixar's story {{department}} began turning their thoughts to their next film. The storyline for A Bug's Life originated from a lunchtime conversation between John Lasseter, Andrew Stanton, Pete Docter, and Joe Ranft, the studio's head story team; other films such as Monsters, Inc. and Finding Nemo were also conceived at this lunch. Lasseter and his story team had already <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> the idea of insects serving as characters. Like toys, insects were within the reach of computer animation back then, due to their relatively simple surfaces. Stanton and Ranft wondered whether they could find a starting point in Aesop's fable The Ant and the Grasshopper. Walt Disney had produced his own version with a cheerier ending decades earlier in the 1934 short film The Grasshopper and the Ants. In addition, Walt Disney Feature Animation (now Walt Disney Animation Studios) had considered producing a film in the late-1980s entitled Army Ants, that centered around a pacifist ant living in a militaristic colony, but this never fully materialized.|$|E

25|$|Many {{practicing}} mathematicians have <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> {{their subject}} {{because of a}} sense of beauty they perceive in it.

25|$|Many {{comparisons}} have <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> other {{video games}} {{in terms of}} artistic design and gameplay.

The vast open-world environment with intense boss fights have been compared to Ico and Shadow of the Colossus, and the watercolor looks to Ōkami.|$|E

25|$|After George Washington {{crossed the}} Delaware River on December 25, 1776, {{the fact that}} {{thousands}} of Hessian troops had <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> Mount Holly aided in the Continental Army's success in the Battle of Trenton the next day, a surprising American victory that helped turn the Army's fading morale after the disastrous defeat at the Battle of Fort Washington just weeks before and the ignominious retreat through New Jersey.|$|E
25|$|In 1945, Davis married artist William Grant Sherry, {{who also}} {{worked as a}} masseur.

The same year, Davis refused the title role in Mildred Pierce (1945), a role for which Joan Crawford won an Academy Award, and instead made The Corn Is Green (1945) based on a play by Emlyn Williams.|$|E

25|$|Events of the {{insurgency}} of Tacfarinas, which persisted during the years 17 to 24, and of the Roman campaign against him, appear in the well-known Annals of the Roman historian Tacitus (c.55–c.117). Parallels have <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> a previous Roman campaign in Numidia against the Berber king Jugurtha (r. 118–105), recorded by the Roman historian Sallust. It has been long alleged that both historians allow ancient Roman political concerns to distort and obscure {{the reality of the}} Berber situation and the Berber leaders.|$|E

Having originally <b>been</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>to</b> vote in the first semi-final, the same semi-final as Andorra, TVE asked the EBU to switch semi-finals to allow for promotion of Eurovision itself. RTVA announced their disappointment on this decision, as RTVA believed that, without Spain voting, Andorra's chances of qualifying would be lower. There was also {{a feeling that the}} amount of promotion done in Spain was to no avail.|$|E
