25|$|The 1960s saw race {{relations}} <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> into the Watts Riots of 1965 {{which resulted in}} 34 deaths and over 1,000 injuries.

The crowd remained peaceful and sang Wobbly songs through the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|By 1991, {{economic}} and political turmoil began to <b>boil</b> <b>over,</b> as the Baltic republics chose to secede from the Soviet Union. On March 17, a referendum was held, in which {{the vast majority of}} participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a renewed federation. In August 1991, a coup d'état attempt by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led {{to the end of the}} Communist Party of the Soviet Union. On December 25, 1991, the USSR was dissolved into 15 post-Soviet states.|$|E
25|$|England as {{expected}} defeated reigning European Champions Wales in their Semi-final at Old Trafford. The other Semi at Huddersfield almost produced a <b>boil</b> <b>over.</b> After defeating New Zealand 3–0 in the Trans-Tasman Test series {{earlier in the}} year, and with the Kiwis lackluster form in their Group B games, Australia w{{as expected}} to easily account for Frank Endacott's side, but the Kiwis found form and the game ended 20–all {{at the end of}} 80 minutes.

25|$|Following the Congress of Vienna, Austria {{became part}} of the German Confederation till the Austro-Prussian war of 1866. In the 19th century {{nationalist}} movements within the empire became increasingly evident, and the German element became increasingly weakened. With Austria's expulsion from the Confederation and the 1866 war the Dual Monarchy with Hungary was created by the Austro-Hungarian Compromise in 1867. This succeeded in reducing but not removing nationalist tensions, which were to <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> with the 1914 assassination of the Austrian heir to the throne, Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo, and the ensuing chain reaction resulting in the First World War. The losses of the war resulted in the collapse of the empire and dynasty in 1918.|$|E
25|$|The play begins {{shortly after}} the death of the Roman emperor, with his two sons, Saturninus and Bassianus, squabbling over who will succeed him. Their {{conflict}} seems set to <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> into violence until a tribune, Marcus Andronicus, announces that the people's choice for the new emperor is Marcus's brother, Titus, who will shortly return to Rome from a victorious ten-year campaign against the Goths. Titus subsequently arrives to much fanfare, bearing with him as prisoners the Queen of the Goths (Tamora), her three sons (Alarbus, Chiron, and Demetrius), and Aaron the Moor (her secret lover). Despite Tamora's desperate pleas, Titus sacrifices her eldest son, Alarbus, to avenge the deaths of his own sons during the war. Distraught, Tamora and her two surviving sons vow to obtain revenge on Titus and his family.|$|E
25|$|During {{the decades}} {{preceding}} the war, the American Anti-Slavery Society sought to promote abolition by educating the populace on {{the evils of}} slavery, and for that purpose, mailed {{thousands upon thousands of}} anti-slavery tracts. The response in the south led the nation to the edge of disaster, only temporarily eased by the Missouri Compromise, and the Compromise of 1850. But the post roads and routes established by Congress in the late 1850s brought a stronger southern mail system, and with it a rising spirit of southern nationalism. Southern public opinion began to <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> as through the southern mails, the fiery pamphlets of the Southern Rights Association other agitators roused a Southern national sentiment. To compound the irony, solidifying of southern opinion was achieved through a mail service that never paid its own way, subsidized largely at northern expense.|$|E

25|$|The remake {{version of}} the video is about a person who loses touch with himself. Originally full of life, the protagonist becomes a robot working a {{monotonous}} office job. One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations <b>boil</b> <b>over,</b> and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what he is running for, and at the moment that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits. He finds a white box that replaced his coffee table and is intrigued. He unwraps the red and white ribbons and opens the box to find himself on the beach with the same girl in his dream and the roses on the water.|$|E
25|$|In the post-SummerSlam wedding reception, Roberts {{and his new}} ally, The Undertaker, {{made their}} {{presence}} known by hiding a live snake {{in one of the}} newly married couple's wedding presents; Elizabeth was frightened when she opened the gift box, and the Undertaker blindsided Savage by knocking him out with the urn. Sid Justice ran off both Roberts and The Undertaker. Savage, still unable to compete due to his WrestleMania VII loss to the Ultimate Warrior, immediately began a public campaign to have himself reinstated as an active wrestler to gain revenge on Roberts; however, WWF President Jack Tunney refused. Meanwhile, Roberts cut a series of promos berating Savage. The feud began to <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> during a television taping for WWF Superstars of Wrestling October 21 in Fort Wayne, Indiana, when Roberts cut an in-ring promo to goad Savage – who was providing TV commentary – into the ring. After he was lured into the ring, Roberts attacked Savage, eventually tying Savage into the ropes before getting a live king cobra to bite his arm, according to Hulk Hogan and Jake Roberts on the Pick Your Poison DVD that the snake was holding on with the fangs and that Jake had a hard time getting the snake off Randy. Sid Justice was originally supposed to be the victim of the snake bite, but due to a biceps injury, Savage accepted to be snake bitten.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Minichiello {{was again}} {{selected}} {{to play for}} New South Wales but just five days out from Game I he was sacked for taking a mobile telephone out contrary to team instructions during a wild bonding session. However he fought his {{way back into the}} squad and help steered New South Wales to its second series victory. He was named the Dally M Fullback of the Year in the 2004 NRL season, where he scored a career best 18 tries for the season. He also won the Harry Sunderland Medal as the player's player of the year. Mini went on to play at fullback for the Roosters in their 16–13 loss to the Bulldogs in the 2004 NRL Grand Final. It was the Roosters third Grand Final loss in four games since 2000. Minichiello was selected in the Australian team to go and compete in the end of season 2004 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament. In the final against Great Britain he played at fullback and scored two tries in the Kangaroos' 44–4 victory. Another great season followed in 2005, where Minichiello's performances at fullback for NSW resulted in him winning the Wally Lewis Medal for player of the 2005 State of Origin series. The year was capped off with him winning the Harry Sunderland Medal again as the man of the 2005 Rugby League Tri-Nations tournament, despite New Zealand causing a <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> by defeating Australia 24–0 in the Final at Elland Road in Leeds (it was the first time since 1972 that Australia had not won an international series or tournament in which they played). The game would also prove to be Anthony Minichiello's 18th and final test for Australia. He would go on to win the 2005 Golden Boot Award as the international player of the year.|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{fighting}} at Wessagusset, Plymouth trade with the Indians was devastated for years. Local tribes which had previously been favorable to Plymouth, began to forge bonds with other tribes in defense against the English. This latent hostility would eventually <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> during the Pequot War and later, King Philip's War. Historians differ on whether the conflict {{could have been avoided}} or the colony saved. Some historians saw the preemptive strike as a necessary one, [...] "saving the lives of hundreds", while others see it as a sad misunderstanding. Speaking shortly after the 150th anniversary of the colony, historian [...] Charles Francis Adams summarized the Wessagusset experience as [...] "ill-conceived, [...] "ill-executed, [...] ill-fated".|$|E
500|$|In 1780 Howe {{lost in his}} bid to {{be re-elected}} to the House of Commons. In 1782 he was named {{lieutenant}} general of the ordnance and appointed to the Privy Council. [...] His colonelcy was transferred from the 23rd Fusiliers to the 19th Light Dragoons in 1786. He resumed limited active duty in 1789, when a crisis with Spain over territorial claims in northwestern North America threatened to <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> into war. [...] The crisis was resolved, and Howe did not see further action until 1793, when the French Revolutionary Wars involved Britain. [...] He was promoted to full general in 1793, and commanded Northern District from 1793 and Eastern District from 1795. In 1795 he was also appointed governor of Berwick-on-Tweed.|$|E

500|$|Following the 1912 Olympics, Patton {{traveled}} to Saumur, France, {{where he learned}} fencing techniques from Adjutant Charles Cléry, a French [...] "master of arms" [...] and instructor of fencing at the cavalry school there. Bringing these lessons back to Fort Myer, Patton redesigned saber combat doctrine for the U.S. cavalry, favoring thrusting attacks over the standard slashing maneuver and designing a new sword for such attacks. He was temporarily assigned to the Office of the Army Chief of Staff, and in 1913, the first 20,000 of the Model 1913 Cavalry Saber—popularly known as the [...] "Patton sword"—were ordered. Patton then returned to Saumur to learn advanced techniques before bringing his skills to the Mounted Service School at Fort Riley, Kansas, {{where he would be}} both a student and a fencing instructor. He was the first Army officer to be designated [...] "Master of the Sword", a title denoting the school's top instructor in swordsmanship. Arriving in September 1913, he taught fencing to other cavalry officers, many of whom were senior to him in rank. Patton graduated from this school in June 1915. He was originally intended to return to the 15th Cavalry, which was bound for the Philippines. Fearing this assignment would dead-end his career, Patton {{traveled to}} Washington, D.C. during 11 days of leave and convinced influential friends to arrange a reassignment for him to the 8th Cavalry at Fort Bliss, Texas, anticipating that instability in Mexico might <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> into a full-scale civil war. In the meantime, Patton was selected to participate in the 1916 Summer Olympics, but that olympiad was cancelled due to World War I.|$|E
500|$|When the House of Commons {{defeated}} the First Reform Bill in 1831, Grey's ministry urged William to dissolve Parliament, which {{would lead to}} a new general election. At first, William hesitated to exercise his prerogative to dissolve Parliament because elections had just been held the year before and the country {{was in a state of}} high excitement which might <b>boil</b> <b>over</b> into violence. He was, however, irritated by the conduct of the Opposition, which announced its intention to move the passage of an Address, or resolution, in the House of Lords, against dissolution. Regarding the Opposition's motion as an attack on his prerogative, and at the urgent request of Lord Grey and his ministers, William IV prepared to go in person to the House of Lords and prorogue Parliament. The monarch's arrival would stop all debate and prevent passage of the Address. When initially told that his horses could not be ready at such short notice, William is supposed to have said, [...] "Then I will go in a hackney cab!" [...] Coach and horses were assembled quickly and William immediately proceeded to Parliament. Said The Times of the scene before William's arrival, [...] "It is utterly impossible to describe the scene... The violent tones and gestures of noble Lords... astonished the spectators, and affected the ladies who were present with visible alarm." [...] Lord Londonderry brandished a whip, threatening to thrash the Government supporters, and was held back by four of his colleagues. William hastily put on the crown, entered the Chamber, and dissolved Parliament. This forced new elections for the House of Commons, which yielded a great victory for the reformers. But although the House of Commons was clearly in favour of parliamentary reform, the House of Lords remained implacably opposed to it.|$|E
500|$|As the Autobots flee, the {{tensions}} {{within the group}} <b>boil</b> <b>over,</b> and Ironhide beats Mirage, whom he believes is the traitor, near to death. He is wrong, as Sunstreaker's guilt finally overtakes him and he confesses everything to Ironhide, before sacrificing himself to halt the Swarm's pursuit by destroying a vital bridge. On Earth Starscream again plans a coup, {{with help from the}} Insecticons, who have experimented on the real reason the Decepticons were able to access the Autobot codes and systems - a captured, dissected but still living Hunter. Spike links up with the remnants of the human resistance, aiming to kill Megatron with a prototype weapon made from Shockwave's gun arm, killing Rumble in the process. His efforts are for naught, as the other world nations still aim to bomb New York. On Cybertron, Prime is revived, managing to quell the dissent amongst the other Autobots. They are almost overwhelmed by the Swarm, but are saved by the timely arrival of Omega Supreme, who transforms and takes the Autobots to Earth. On Earth Starscream begins a coup against Megatron, gathering the Insecticons and Constructicons to his side. Megatron battles back and avoids being killed by Devastator as the United Nations begin a determined aerial counterstrike. As Starscream realizes that Megatron has orchestrated his coup to weed out the weak in the Decepticons, the Autobots arrive and attack. In the midst of the battle, Megatron reveals his strategy. More of his troops are hidden, disguised, among the humans, including the carrier for the UN nuclear bomb. With this, Megatron intends to wipe out the humans. However, with the intervention of a disgruntled Thundercracker the European Union is prevented from nuking New York City, though he pays for his [...] "betrayal". Megatron is severely damaged by the combined efforts of Optimus Prime and Spike, but is saved by Starscream who determines that {{the only way he could}} become the leader of the Decepticons is by taking the leadership from Megatron and not for it to be offered to him. The Decepticons retreat from Earth leaving the Autobots amongst humans hostile toward any Cybertronians. Sideswipe discovers the captive Hunter, who had been tortured by Bombshell's experiments, and euthanizes him.|$|E
