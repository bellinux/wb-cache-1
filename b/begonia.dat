5|$|The American <b>Begonia</b> Society {{gives an}} annual Alfred D. Robinson Medal of Honor for {{creating}} new varieties of <b>begonia.</b>|$|E
5|$|Alfred D. Robinson (1866-1942) and {{his wife}} Marion James Robinson (1873-1919) were wealthy {{residents}} of San Diego, California known for their impact on gardening and the cultivation of flowers, particularly begonias. Their extensive home garden was used to propagate and develop more than 100 new varieties of ornamental flowers and was later {{opened to the public}} as Rosecroft <b>Begonia</b> Gardens. Rosecroft was the name of their estate in the Point Loma neighborhood of San Diego. The residence, built for them in 1912, is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|Marion died in 1919. In 1922, Alfred married Annie Louisa Colby Robinson (1891-1981), the governess to his {{daughter}} Charlotte; they had five children. After Alfred's death in 1942, Annie sold the property. A new owner opened the garden and lath house {{to the public as}} Rosecroft <b>Begonia</b> Gardens. The gardens were a popular tourist attraction through the 1960s. In the 1970s, the property was sold and the garden area subdivided for residential use. The original main residence is privately owned and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
40|$|Bali Botanic Garden has {{becoming}} one of the botanic gardens in the world that has quite complete <b>Begonias</b> collection. Up to now (Sept 2007) its <b>Begonias</b> collection consists of 215 species, comprise of 70 species of wild <b>Begonias</b> (originated in Indonesia) and 145 species ofexotic <b>Begonias.</b> Some aspects of research has been done {{and one of them is}} the reproductive biology. This research is aimed to gatherinformation about <b>Begonia’s</b> life cycle and also to know about the natural obstacle that cause the wild <b>Begonias</b> failure in forming theirseeds. Final result of this research is the important informations that are useful for breeding and seed’s banking. Flowering observationwere done everyday towards the 22 species of wild <b>Begonias</b> that are planted in Bali Botanic Garden during 2006. Data collection weredone qualitatively by counting the amount of flowers that appeared. Results showed that flowering period of 22 species wild <b>Begonias</b> canbe grouped as : Flowering troughout the year group; Seasonal Floweing group; Rare Flowering group; Not Flowering or has not floweringBegonias group; Not all <b>Begonias</b> that floweing are capable to form fruits and seed...|$|R

25|$|Several {{plant species}} were named in his honour, such as <b>Begonia</b> bonus-henricus J.J. de Wilde, Crudia dewitii Kostermans, Cryptocoryne dewitii Jacobsen, Homalium dewitii Kostermans, Bauhinia dewitii K.Larsen & S.S.Larsen, Rinorea dewitii Achound., and Lagenandra dewitii Crusio et de Graaf.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{species of}} houseplants can also prove toxic if {{consumed}} by pets. Examples include philodendrons and Easter lilies (which can cause severe kidney damage to cats) and poinsettias, <b>begonia,</b> and aloe vera (which can sicken or, in extreme cases, kill dogs).|$|E
5000|$|John Seden (1840-1921) was a hybridist and {{horticulturist}} {{best known}} for the hybrids he created while in the employment of Veitch Nurseries. He was trained in hybridizing by John Dominy in 1861. In 1873 he began hybridizing tuberous <b>begonias</b> which in turn formed the basis from which modern garden <b>begonias</b> are derived.|$|R

25|$|Both sides had no {{idea what}} damage they had done to each other until dawn broke the next day; the English {{as a result of their}} {{firepower}} could then see that the Spanish ship <b>Begonia</b> had sunk revealing only her masts in the shallow water. This time in daylight at 10 am Equino’s two galleons attacked but were repelled again by the anchored English ships.|$|E
25|$|The battle {{had only}} cost eight Englishmen killed and twenty injured and only {{moderate}} damage to their ships. An Indian who went aboard the Leicester told Fenton that the Spanish who had landed at Santos further down had suffered heavily. As well as <b>Begonia</b> sunk {{with the loss}} of thirty two men killed, the galleon Concepción was heavily damaged bringing the total to nearly a hundred dead and many more wounded. The Indian also said that the Spanish had carried the casualties to the shore in three small boats a number of times.|$|E

25|$|The 1950s {{brought a}} new {{optimism}} to the city. On 17 April 1952 {{it was announced that}} Lake Wendouree was to be the venue for rowing events of the 1956 Summer Olympics, and work soon began on an Olympic village in Gillies Street. A new prefabricted power terminal substation at Norman Street Ballarat North was constructed between 1951 and 1953 by the State Electricity Commission. The first <b>Begonia</b> Festival, a highly successful community celebration, was held in 1953. Elizabeth II visited on 8 March 1954. The Civic Centre, Prince Alfred Hall had burned down suspiciously that year; however a new Civic Hall was constructed and opened in March 1955. On 23 November 1956, the Olympic torch was carried through the city, and the following day the rowing events were held at the lake. On 2 March 1958 the Queen Mother visited Ballarat.|$|E
25|$|Baker quickly {{made the}} part his own, viewing figures {{for his first}} few years {{returning}} to a level {{not seen since the}} height of 'Dalekmania' a decade earlier. His eccentric style of dress and quirky personality (particularly his trademark long scarf and fondness for jelly babies), as well as his distinctive voice, made him an immediately recognisable figure and he quickly caught the viewing public's imagination. Baker played the Doctor for seven consecutive seasons, making him the longest-serving actor in the part. Baker himself suggested many aspects of his Doctor's personality, but the distinctive scarf was created by accident. James Acheson, the costume designer assigned to his first story, had provided far more wool than was necessary to the knitter, <b>Begonia</b> Pope, intending for her to choose a suitable colour. However, due to miscommunication Pope knitted all the wool she was given. It was Baker who suggested that he wear the ridiculously long scarf, which he did once it had been shortened a bit to make it more manageable.|$|E
500|$|Alfred, a self-taught horticulturist, began {{experimenting with}} roses and dahlias, but {{eventually}} came {{to focus on}} begonias. He became [...] "the pre-eminent <b>begonia</b> expert", developing more than 100 new varieties at the Rosecroft estate. Alfred's were judged [...] "the finest begonias to be grown anywhere in the world" [...] by plant explorer and botanist David Fairchild.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the current}} {{government}} interpretation of the flag, the red background symbolises the revolution and the golden colours were used to [...] "radiate" [...] on the red background. The five stars and their relationship represents the unity of Chinese people {{under the leadership of}} the Communist Party of China. The orientation of the stars shows that the unity should go around a center. In the original description of the flag by Zeng, the larger star symbolizes the Communist Party of China, and the four smaller stars that surround the big star symbolize the four social classes (the working class, the peasantry, the urban petite bourgeoisie and the national bourgeoisie) of Chinese people mentioned in Mao's [...] "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship". [...] The five stars that formed an ellipse represent the territory of China which is shaped like a <b>Begonia</b> leaf. It is sometimes stated that the five stars of the flag represent the five largest ethnic groups: Han Chinese, Zhuangs, Hui Chinese, Manchus and Uyghurs. This is generally regarded as an erroneous conflation with the [...] "Five Races Under One Union" [...] flag, used 1912–28 by the Beiyang Government of Republic of China, whose different-coloured stripes represented the Han Chinese, Hui Chinese, Manchus, Mongols and Tibetans.|$|E

2500|$|According to Baker, the Doctor's scarf was {{the idea}} of costume {{designer}} James Acheson. [...] Acheson, knowing little about knitting, procured large quantities of various colours of wool, and commissioned <b>Begonia</b> Pope, a friend of his, to create a colourful design. [...] She proceeded to use all of the wool provided, resulting in the absurdly long, but iconic, accessory.|$|E
