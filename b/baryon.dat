5|$|This table {{gives the}} name, quantum numbers (where known), and {{experimental}} status of baryons resonances {{confirmed by the}} PDG. <b>Baryon</b> resonance particles are excited <b>baryon</b> states with short half lives and higher masses. Despite significant research, the fundamental degrees of freedom behind <b>baryon</b> excitation spectra are still poorly understood. The spin-parity JP (when known) is given with each particle. For the strongly decaying particles, the JP values {{are considered to be}} part of the names, as is the mass for all resonances.|$|E
5|$|The photon is {{the gauge}} boson for electromagnetism, and {{therefore}} all other quantum {{numbers of the}} photon (such as lepton number, <b>baryon</b> number, and flavour quantum numbers) are zero. Also, the photon does not obey the Pauli exclusion principle.|$|E
5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{understood}} why the universe has more matter than antimatter. It is generally assumed that {{when the universe was}} young and very hot it was in statistical equilibrium and contained equal numbers of baryons and antibaryons. However, observations suggest that the universe, including its most distant parts, is made almost entirely of matter. A process called baryogenesis was hypothesized to account for the asymmetry. For baryogenesis to occur, the Sakharov conditions must be satisfied. These require that <b>baryon</b> number is not conserved, that C-symmetry and CP-symmetry are violated and that the universe depart from thermodynamic equilibrium. All these conditions occur in the Standard Model, but the effects are not strong enough to explain the present <b>baryon</b> asymmetry.|$|E

The pentaquark <b>baryons</b> form 1, 8, 10, 1 ̅ 0 ̅, 27, and 35 multiplets in SU(3) quark model. First, the flavor wave functions of all the pentaquark <b>baryons</b> are constructed in SU(3) quark model and then the flavor SU(3) symmetry relations for the interactions of the pentaquarks with three-quark <b>baryons</b> and pentaquark <b>baryons</b> are obtained...|$|R

5|$|J = total angular momentum, B = <b>baryon</b> number, Q = {{electric}} charge, I3 = isospin, C = charm, S = strangeness, T = topness, B′ = bottomness. * Notation such as ±710 denotes {{two types}} of measurement uncertainty. In {{the case of the}} top quark, the first uncertainty is statistical in nature, and the second is systematic.|$|E
5|$|Given {{sufficiently}} high <b>baryon</b> densities {{and relatively}} low temperatures – possibly {{comparable to those}} found in neutron stars – quark matter is expected to degenerate into a Fermi liquid of weakly interacting quarks. This liquid would be characterized by a condensation of colored quark Cooper pairs, thereby breaking the local SU(3)c symmetry. Because quark Cooper pairs harbor color charge, such a phase of quark matter would be color superconductive; that is, color charge would be able to pass through it with no resistance.|$|E
5|$|Six {{clusters}} were imaged in 2007: the Abell clusters 1689, 1995, 2142, 2163, 2261 and 2390, {{which have}} redshifts between 0.091 and 0.322. For {{the largest and}} brightest four of these—Abell 1689, 2261, 2142 and 2390—comparisons were made with X-ray and Subaru weak lensing data to study the cluster layout and radial properties, specifically of the mass profiles and <b>baryon</b> content. It is predicted that AMiBA with either 13 or 19 elements {{will be able to}} detect around 80 clusters per year via the SZ effect.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} table {{summarizes the}} key {{properties of the}} six quarks. Flavor quantum numbers (isospin (I3), charm (C), strangeness (S, {{not to be confused}} with spin), topness (T), and bottomness (B′)) are assigned to certain quark flavors, and denote qualities of quark-based systems and hadrons. The <b>baryon</b> number (B) is + for all quarks, as baryons are made of three quarks. For antiquarks, the electric charge (Q) and all flavor quantum numbers (B, I3, C, S, T, and B′) are of opposite sign. Mass and total angular momentum (J; equal to spin for point particles) do not change sign for the antiquarks.|$|E
5|$|In modern cosmological theory, {{diffusion}} damping, {{also called}} photon diffusion damping, {{is a physical}} process which reduced density inequalities (anisotropies) in the early universe, making the universe itself and {{the cosmic microwave background}} radiation (CMB) more uniform. Around 300,000 years after the Big Bang, during the epoch of recombination, diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones, equalising the temperatures of these regions. This effect is responsible, along with <b>baryon</b> acoustic oscillations, the Doppler effect, and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation, for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters, these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe. It is a damping by diffusion, not of diffusion.|$|E
5|$|Since baryons are {{composed}} of quarks, they participate in the strong interaction. Leptons, on the other hand, are not composed of quarks and as such {{do not participate in}} the strong interaction. The most famous baryons are the protons and neutrons that make up most of the mass of the visible matter in the universe, whereas electrons, the other major component of atoms, are leptons. Each <b>baryon</b> has a corresponding antiparticle known as an antibaryon in which quarks are replaced by their corresponding antiquarks. For example, a proton is made of two up quarks and one down quark, while its corresponding antiparticle, the antiproton, is made of two up antiquarks and one down antiquark.|$|E
25|$|The very {{existence}} of <b>baryons</b> is also a significant issue in cosmology, because {{it is assumed that}} the Big Bang produced a state with equal amounts of <b>baryons</b> and antibaryons. The process by which <b>baryons</b> came to outnumber their antiparticles is called baryogenesis.|$|R

5|$|Though general {{diffusion}} damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion, the term Silk damping {{applies only to}} damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter, which is coupled to the diffusing photons, not dark matter, and diffuses with them. Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early isocurvature fluctuations (i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons). In this case, increases in <b>baryon</b> density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density, and the lower the photon density, the less diffusion there would be: the less diffusion, the less damping. Photon diffusion is not dependent on {{the causes of the}} initial fluctuations in the density of the universe.|$|E
25|$|Baryogenesis {{within the}} Standard Model {{requires}} the electroweak symmetry breaking be a first-order phase transition, since otherwise sphalerons wipe off any <b>baryon</b> asymmetry that happened {{up to the}} phase transition, while later the amount of <b>baryon</b> non-conserving interactions is negligible.|$|E

In this alternative large Nc limit {{at least some of the}} <b>baryons</b> behave like mesons, that is they stay light even at large Nc and their interactions vanish in that limit. For Nc = 3 these alternative large Nc <b>baryons</b> are equivalent to the standard <b>baryons.</b> In the holographic description it is manifest that the Regge slopes of mesons and alternative <b>baryons</b> are degenerate. ...|$|R

25|$|Historically, lensing {{analyses}} were conducted on galaxy clusters detected via their <b>baryon</b> content (e.g. from optical or X-ray surveys). The sample of galaxy clusters studied with lensing was thus subject to various selection effects; for example, only the most luminous clusters were investigated. In 2006, David Wittman of the University of California at Davis and collaborators published the first sample of galaxy clusters detected via their lensing signals, completely independent of their <b>baryon</b> content. Clusters discovered through lensing are subject to mass selection effects because the more massive clusters produce lensing signals with higher signal-to-noise.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe SELEX Collaboration has {{reported}} {{a very large}} isospin splitting of doubly charmed <b>baryons.</b> We show that this effect would imply that the doubly charmed <b>baryons</b> are very compact.
