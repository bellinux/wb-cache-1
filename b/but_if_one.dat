Each was capable of supplying the power necessary for all of the equipment. They were normally alternately switched, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> failed the other would take over. On-board batteries could also supply temporary power.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, the Mishnah {{taught that}} a stolen or {{withered}} myrtle is not valid. If its tip is broken off, or its leaves are severed, or its berries are more numerous than its leaves, it is invalid. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> picks off berries to diminish their number, it is valid.

25|$|Juries {{are used}} in trials for all trials {{involving}} Category 4 offences such as treason, murder and manslaughter, although in exceptional circumstances a judge-alone trial may be ordered. At the option of the defendant, juries {{may be used in}} trials involving Category 3 offences, that is offences where the maximum penalty available is two years imprisonment or greater. In civil cases juries are usually only used in cases of defamation. Juries must initially try to reach a unanimous verdict, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> cannot be reached in a reasonable timeframe, the judge may accept a majority verdict of all-but-one (i.e. 11–1 or 10–1) in criminal cases and three-quarters (i.e. 9–3 or 9–2) in civil cases.|$|E
25|$|It is {{believed}} that people who commit sins go to Hell {{and have to go}} through punishments in accordance with the sins they committed. The god Yamarāja, who is also the god of death, presides over Hell. Detailed accounts of all the sins committed by an individual are kept by Chitragupta, who is the record keeper in Yama's court. Chitragupta reads out the sins committed and Yama orders appropriate punishments to be given to individuals. These punishments include dipping in boiling oil, burning in fire, torture using various weapons, etc. in various Hells. Individuals who finish their quota of the punishments are reborn in accordance with their balance of karma. All created beings are imperfect and thus have at least one sin to their record; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> has generally led a pious life, one ascends to svarga, a temporary realm of enjoyment similar to Paradise, after a brief period of expiation in Hell and before the next reincarnation, according to the law of karma.|$|E
25|$|The {{regiment}} {{trained in}} the infantry tank ('I' tank) role on Churchill tanks, and {{in the winter of}} 1942–43 was mobilised for the Allied invasion of Sicily. But the orders were changed, 144 RAC had to hand its Churchills over to a Canadian regiment, and was re-equipped instead with Sherman tanks. The following autumn it reverted to Churchills, then finally, in the winter of 1943–44, it was converted back to Shermans for the Normandy landings. The training was also broadened and 33rd Tank Brigade was redesignated 33rd Armoured Brigade. The plan was still for it to land in the infantry tank role, supporting 49th (West Riding) Infantry Division, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> of the armoured divisions suffered heavy casualties, 33rd would be ready to switch roles and replace its armoured brigade. It was therefore equipped with a proportion of Sherman Firefly tanks armed with the 17-pounder, and the tank gunners practised with this weapon at Holkham Field Firing Range. Lieutenant Colonel A. Jolly, Royal Tank Regiment, (later General Sir Alan Jolly), took command on 10 April 1944.|$|E

25|$|Dabar ha-lamed me-inyano ("Something proved by the context") {{refers to}} {{definition}} from the context. Rabbi Ishmael omits rule 6 entirely, and has another (No. 13) instead {{which is not}} found in Hillel, and which reads thus: שני כתובים המכחישים זה את זה, עד שיבוא הכתוב השלישי ויכריע ביניהם ("If two passages contradict each other, this contradiction must be reconciled by comparison with a third passage"). The method of solution of such opposing statements by {{the help of a}} third passage is a point of divergency between Ishmael and Akiva. According to the latter, the third sentence decides in favor of one of the two contradictory statements (Mekhilta, ed. Isaac Hirsch Weiss, 6a); according to the former, it modifies the interpretation of both. With regard to the meaning of words which are pointed in the text, Simeon ben Eleazar laid down the rule that if the pointed part of the word (נקודה) is equal to the unpointed part (כתב) in length, the word must not be interpreted at all; <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> part is longer than the other, such part must be interpreted (Genesis Rabbah lxxviii.). Concerning the interpretation of words by a change of letters or vowels the rule is: אל תקרא ("Do not read so, but so"). Under this rule the integrity of the text itself is not assailed, the changes made being only for the purpose of explanation.|$|E
500|$|After Thorpe's death, {{sympathetic}} commentators {{drew attention}} to his internationalism and social liberalism, highlighting his long involvement with the anti-apartheid movement, his denunciations of dictators, {{his opposition to the}} death penalty, and his rejection of racism. [...] There is wide agreement that he was an outstanding political campaigner—persuasive, witty, and warm: [...] "his astonishing memory for faces persuaded voters that they were intimate friends... his resourceful mind afforded quips and stunts for every occasion." [...] A different perspective on Thorpe, quoted by Bloch, was given by a former friend, the art expert David Carritt, {{at the time of the}} trial: [...] "Self-centred...Mildly entertaining, slightly sinister. Said to be witty, <b>but...</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> doesn't care for impersonations, he's really a bit of a bore".|$|E

Although the use of assembling individual characters to compose {{a piece of text}} had its origins in antiquity, Bi Sheng's methodical innovation was something completely revolutionary for his time. Shen Kuo noted that the process was tedious if one only wanted to print a few copies of a book, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> desired to make hundreds or thousands of copies, the process was incredibly fast and efficient. Beyond Shen Kuo's writing, however, nothing is known of Bi Sheng's life or the influence of movable type in his lifetime.

500|$|By {{the time}} of Dunglass's {{appointment}} Chamberlain was generally seen as {{the heir to the}} premiership, and in 1937 the incumbent, Stanley Baldwin, retired, and Chamberlain succeeded him. He retained Dunglass as his PPS, a role described by the biographer D R Thorpe as [...] "the right-hand man... the eyes and ears of Neville Chamberlain", and by Dutton as [...] "liaison officer with the Parliamentary party, transmitting and receiving information and [...] his master informed of the mood on the government's back benches". This was particularly important for Chamberlain, who was often seen as distant and aloof; Douglas Hurd wrote that he [...] "lacked the personal charm which makes competent administration palatable to wayward colleagues– a gift which his parliamentary private secretary possessed in abundance". Dunglass admired Chamberlain, despite his daunting personality: [...] "I liked him, and I think he liked me. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>one</b> went in {{at the end of the}} day for a chat or a gossip, he would be inclined to ask 'What do you want?'

500|$|Di Grassi {{was handed}} a formal {{reprimand}} by the stewards over the pit stop release that caused Piquet to brake to avoid hitting {{him and was}} fined €1,500. Piquet felt it was not fair for different punishments to exist for the same penalty and was frustrated, complaining of inconsistency from the stewards. He warned drivers would become quickly disenchanted and believed stewards would not be taken seriously in future races. Piquet advocated for more people to observe the track, install more cameras and fit a GPS system in all cars. D'Ambrosio felt aggrieved over the battle between his teammate Duval in the race's closing period, saying the events were [...] "a {{little bit of a}} pity" [...] and was unsure whether it was a misunderstanding. Duval insisted the battle was firm but fair, saying he gave d'Ambrosio room but would make it difficult for anyone to overtake him: [...] "As you have seen in the past though we have had fights {{and most of the time}} I was really gentle, and this weekend I was in this position where I was competitive and I had less energy available so I fought."
