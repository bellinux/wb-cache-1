40|$|Abstract Background Accurate cost {{estimate}} and a {{profit and loss}} analysis are necessary for health care practice. We performed an actual financial analysis for an intensive care unit (ICU) of a university hospital in Japan, and tried to discuss the health care policy and resource allocation decisions that {{have an impact on}} critical intensive care. Methods The costs were estimated by a department level activity based costing method, and the profit and loss analysis was based on a <b>break-even</b> point <b>analysis.</b> The data used included the monthly number of patients, the revenue, and the direct and indirect costs of the ICU in 2003. Results The results of this analysis showed that the total costs of US$ 2, 678, 052 of the ICU were mainly incurred due to direct costs of 88. 8 %. On the other hand, the actual annual total patient days in the ICU were 1, 549 which resulted in revenues of US$ 2, 295, 044. However, it was determined that the ICU required at least 1, 986 patient days within one fiscal year based on a <b>break-even</b> point <b>analysis.</b> As a result, an annual deficit of US$ 383, 008 has occurred in the ICU. Conclusion These methods are useful for determining the profits or losses for the ICU practice, and how to evaluate and to improve it. In this study, the results indicate that most ICUs in Japanese hospitals may not be profitable at the present time. As a result, in order to increase the income to make up for this deficit, an increase of 437 patient days in the ICU in one fiscal year is needed, and the number of patients admitted to the ICU should thus be increased without increasing the number of beds or staff members. Increasing the number of patients referred from cooperating hospitals and clinics therefore appears to be the best strategy for achieving these goals. </p...|$|R

40|$|Reviews linear <b>break-even</b> <b>analysis</b> as {{typically}} {{outlined in}} textbooks on managerial economics. It is claimed {{that a major}} shortcoming of these expositions is their failure to demonstrate in what circumstances linear <b>break-even</b> <b>analysis</b> is relevant for a business and in what circumstances it is inapplicable. This article helps rectify this situation. It points out that such analysis can not be applied to perfectly competitive firms. However, in special circumstances, it might apply to a purely competitive firm. It is highly relevant for businesses operating in oligopolistic conditions where the kinked demand curve applies. Furthermore, it is applicable if imperfectly competitive firms follow fixed price rules. On the other hand, if imperfectly competitive firms, such as monopolists, adopt flexible pricing (for example, prices to clear whatever quantity of product they have supplied to the market) the linearity assumption involved {{in this type of}} <b>break-even</b> <b>analysis</b> will, as a rule, be violated. This is so because the firm’s total revenue will be a non-linear function of the quantity of the product supplied by the firm to the market. Nevertheless, because fixed price behaviour by businesses may be common, as well as constant average variable costs of production over a considerable range of output, linear break-even analyses has a considerable range of application to businesslinear <b>break-even</b> <b>analysis,</b> perfectly competitive firms, oligopolistic conditions, fixed price rules, Production Economics, Teaching/Communication/Extension/Profession,...|$|E
