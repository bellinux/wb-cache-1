50|$|The (national) bank codes {{differ from}} the {{international}} Bank Identifier Code (BIC/ISO 9362, a normalized code - also known as Business Identifier Code, Bank International Code and SWIFT code). Those countries which use International <b>Bank</b> <b>Account</b> Numbers (<b>IBAN)</b> have mostly integrated the bank code into the prefix of specifying <b>IBAN</b> <b>account</b> numbers. The <b>bank</b> codes also {{differ from the}} Bank card code (CSC).|$|R
25|$|The International <b>Bank</b> <b>Account</b> Number (<b>IBAN)</b> is {{an internationally}} agreed system of {{identifying}} <b>bank</b> <b>accounts</b> across national borders {{to facilitate the}} communication and processing of cross border transactions with a reduced risk of transcription errors. It was originally adopted by the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS), and later as an international standard under ISO 13616:1997. The current standard is ISO 13616:2007, which indicates SWIFT as the formal registrar. Initially developed to facilitate payments within the European Union, it has been implemented by most European countries and numerous countries in {{the other parts of}} the world, mainly in the Middle East and in the Caribbean. As of February 2016, 69 countries were using the IBAN numbering system.|$|R
50|$|A {{comparable}} {{application is}} {{to split up}} binary and hexadecimal number representations, telephone numbers, <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> numbers (ea. <b>IBAN,</b> social security numbers, number plates etcetera in groups ranging from 2 to 5 digits separated by spaces, dots, dashes or other separators. This to support overseeing completeness of a number when comparing or retyping. This practise of grouping characters also supports easier memorisation of large numbers and character structures.|$|R
25|$|Modular {{arithmetic}} {{is often}} used to calculate checksums that are used within identifiers. International Standard Book Number (ISBN) uses modulo 11 (if issued before 1 January, 2007) or modulo 10 (if issued on or after 1 January, 2007) arithmetic for error detection. Likewise, International <b>Bank</b> <b>Account</b> Numbers (<b>IBANs),</b> for example, make use of modulo 97 arithmetic to trap user input errors in <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> numbers. In chemistry, the last digit of the CAS registry number (a number which is unique for each chemical compound) is a check digit, which is calculated by taking the last digit of the first two parts of the CAS registry number times 1, the previous digit times 2, the previous digit times 3 etc., adding all these up and computing the sum modulo 10.|$|R
25|$|With {{a further}} {{decision}} of the European Parliament, the <b>IBAN</b> scheme for <b>bank</b> <b>accounts</b> fully replaced the domestic numbering schemes from 31 December 2012. On 16 December 2010, the European Commission published proposed regulations that will make IBAN support mandatory for domestic credit transfer by 2013 and for domestic direct debit by 2014 (with a 12 and 24 months transition period respectively). Some countries have already replaced their traditional <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> scheme by <b>IBAN.</b> This includes Switzerland where IBAN was introduced for national credit transfer on 1 January 2006 and the support for the old <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> numbers has not been required from 1 January 2010.|$|R
50|$|Short Payment Descriptor (SPAYD, SPD) is {{a compact}} data format {{for an easy}} {{exchange}} of a payment information using modern electronic channels, such as smart phones or NFC devices. Practically, the format is being deployed in the Czech Republic (where the format is an accepted unique standard for QR code payments) and Slovak Republic, but format can be technically used with any <b>bank</b> using <b>IBAN</b> <b>account</b> numbers. That includes currently most of European countries, some in the Middle East and few other ones.|$|R
2500|$|In 1997, to {{overcome}} these difficulties, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) published ISO 13616:1997. This proposal had a degree of flexibility, which the European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS) believed would make it unworkable, and they produced a [...] "slimmed down" [...] version of the standard which, amongst other things, permitted only upper-case letters and required that the IBAN for each country have a fixed length. ISO 13616:1997 was subsequently withdrawn and replaced by ISO 13616:2003. The standard was revised again in 2007 when it was split into two parts. ISO 13616-1:2007 [...] "specifies the elements of an international <b>bank</b> <b>account</b> number (<b>IBAN)</b> used to facilitate the processing of data internationally in data interchange, in financial environments as well as within and between other industries" [...] but [...] "does not specify internal procedures, file organization techniques, storage media, languages, etc. {{to be used in}} its implementation". ISO 13616-2:2007 describes [...] "the Registration Authority (RA) responsible for the registry of IBAN formats that are compliant with ISO 13616-1 [...] the procedures for registering ISO 13616-compliant IBAN formats". The official IBAN registrar under ISO 13616-2:2007 is SWIFT.|$|R

When a less educated family becomes an owner of a <b>bank</b> <b>account,</b> I find a 71 percentage point increase in the probability of owning a credit card, an increase of 1. 4 household durable goods, and no change in vehicle ownership or purchase.
