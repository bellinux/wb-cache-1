500|$|The {{earliest}} {{description of}} carbon monoxide poisoning dates to at least 200 BC by Aristotle. Documented cases {{of carbon monoxide}} {{being used as a}} method of suicide date to at least 100 BC in ancient Rome. In the AD 350s, the Roman emperor Julian suffered from carbon monoxide poisoning in Paris, and later described it in his work Misopogon: [...] "though the winter weather prevailed and continually increased in severity, even so I did not allow my servants to heat the house, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of drawing out the dampness in the walls; but I ordered them to carry in fire that had burned down and to place in the room a very moderate number of hot coals. But the coals, though there were not very many of them, brought out from the walls quantities of steam and this made me fall asleep. And since my head was filled with the fumes I was almost choked. Then I was carried outside." [...] This misunderstanding of the causes of carbon monoxide poisoning may have caused the death of Julian's successor, Jovian.|$|E
500|$|Chloe's first romantic {{relationship}} {{is with the}} man {{believed to be the}} millionaire son of Jill Abbott, Cane Ashby (Daniel Goddard). In July 2009, it is revealed that Cane Ashby is not the son of Jill Abbott. Hendrickson compared their relationship, which ensued as a result of Chloe practically [...] "threatening him", to the psychological thriller film Fatal Attraction (1987); [...] "I've definitely channeled my inner Glenn Close at times. But I'm trying really hard not to make Chloe go down the crazy path. I don't think she's crazy. She just desperately wants to be loved," [...] she said. While Cane is drunk, Chloe sleeps with him and becomes pregnant. Hendrickson described Chloe's actions as [...] "definitely plotting" [...] but, in reference to Chloe's backstory, said it was [...] "not because of who he is. She just wanted him". Prior to the revelation that she is Kate Valentine, Chloe marries Cane, angering the Chancellors. According to the actress, Chloe's [...] "defense" [...] is, [...] "I came here to start fresh and I wanted to do it on my own. I didn't tell Cane <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> he would think I was going after him for his money. There was no plotting." [...] Chloe disrupts the pairing of Cane and Lily Winters (Christel Khalil), creating a [...] "bitchy" [...] rivalry between the female characters. Ultimately, Chloe gives birth to a daughter named Cordelia [...] "Delia" [...] Abbott (Sophie Pollono). In a dramatic love rectangle storyline, it is revealed that Delia's father is actually Jill's son, Billy Abbott (Billy Miller); this revelation ends Chloe's manipulations of Cane, despite his excitement at the prospect of being a father.|$|E
500|$|An attorney-at-law with a {{disability}} who was blinded as a youth in an accident with bio-waste that drastically heightened his remaining senses {{and gave him a}} [...] "sonar-sense", which allowed him to perceive his surroundings, and makes a silent promise with his father to [...] "stick up for the long shots". His father is killed not long after and at that moment, he vows to seek justice. At night, he becomes a devil-modeled vigilante who takes justice into his hands. Affleck was cast in October 2001. Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and that sticks with them. This story was that for me." [...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

I can't tell whether it's a real fancy, or I only think it <b>is.</b> Sometimes <b>I</b> think it <b>is,</b> and {{sometimes}} <b>I</b> think that <b>I</b> think so <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> to believe it. Do you under Ellen?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Medcalf has {{revealed}} to the Walford Gazette how she prepared for the role: [...] "I actually watched the show a bit when Danniella had been on so I had a distinct memory of her to work with. What I basically did was to read a prepared, detailed biography of the character which {{was provided by the}} production office. I did sit down to watch a five-minute clip of Danniella but I quickly realised I didn't want to carry on watching <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of falling into doing an imitation of her, d'ye know what I mean? I'll tell you something weird-when I first started getting the scripts I used to hear the lines first in my head with HER voice saying them! But that changed over time, thank God, as I hopefully made the character my own and I gave her my voice." [...] Medcalf added that contrastingly to Westbrook, who played Sam as a young girl who was overprotected by her brothers and sheltered, she played Sam as a young woman [...] "trying to find her place both in a career and in relationships with the opposite sex." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't--I haven't a cent of money," [...] wailed Grandma. [...] "I gave {{it all to}} Cyrus <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{my pocket}} would be picked. Oh, what shall I do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{brought it}} to see my way back with," [...] said Maud in a curious, small voice. [...] "It's very dark across the fields. I didn't light it before, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> {{somebody}} might see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I work," [...] he admitted, [...] "but I {{sometimes}} {{ask myself}} whether I {{work with the}} same motives as I did when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young. <b>I</b> started life as an altruist. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not sure now whether <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not working in self-defence, from habit, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> of falling behind." ...|$|R
5000|$|Avraham Poraz, Israel's Interior Minister {{and member}} of the centrist Shinui Party, said he {{believed}} the assassination of Yassin [...] "was a bad idea <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> of a revenge coming from the Palestinian side, from the Hamas side." [...] Shimon Peres, then leader of the Labour opposition, was critical of the assassination, suggesting that it [...] "could lead to an escalation of terror".|$|R
6000|$|... "Well-nigh half of {{them are}} still alive," [...] he said, [...] "and all of them are men of rank and repute, whose word would be taken even by an enemy.

6000|$|Mrs. Penniman was {{slightly}} embarrassed, {{for she had}} not told her niece of her intended expedition. [...] "Not exactly a message," [...] she said; [...] "I didn't ask her for one, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to--to excite her." ...|$|E
60|$|I did {{not turn}} the lamps out. I went into Strickland's room first, and allowed {{him to make the}} darkness. Then he {{followed}} me, and we lit tobacco and thought. Strickland thought. I smoked furiously, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} judge of Celia's feeling from mine. I think she likes these small pets. She had a tiny terrier once, {{which she was}} very fond of. It made me unhappy, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of {{treading}} on it. I am rather short-sighted." ...|$|E
50|$|When {{he learned}} {{that he would be}} {{promoted}} to Corvette Captain, he finally decided to ask for Carmela's hand, in 1873.

6000|$|Her {{voice was}} very sincere as she said: [...] "You don't know how anxiously I watch the make-up of my circle. It isn't <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> of sceptics; <b>I</b> {{have no fear}} {{of those who do}} not believe; but each person brings such diverse {{influences}}, and these influences conflict and worry me, and then nothing takes place.

6000|$|... 'Oh, no! Of course not. Is it {{possible}} you don't {{know that when}} we leave home we always hang up our hearts on trees, to prevent their being troublesome? However, perhaps you won't believe that, and will just think I have invented it <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid,</b> so let us go on to your country {{as fast as we}} can, and when we arrive you can look for my heart, and if you find it you can kill me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{hope that}} he may, one day, be the nearest and dearest {{relation}} {{to me that a}} woman can have." [...] I said those words boldly, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of his otherwise taking some wrong view of the connection between Robert and me ...|$|E
6000|$|She smiled. [...] "Of course! I {{must have}} been, when I {{came to you}} <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of Thorn. Love gave me confidence; I knew you would help. In a way, I did an extravagant thing, because you were not really like a lover at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, Ethel! Ethel! I {{have never}} told you what I have undergone, since I knew my former {{quietness}} of conscience was but sleep!

6000|$|... "Be it so, sir," [...] replied Mr. Vere; [...] "you {{are entirely}} safe from my resentment, {{because you are}} beneath it, and not <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> of your {{disclosing}} my family secrets, although, for your own sake, I warn you to beware how you do so.

6000|$|... (Which I did, later.) Wilberforce {{carried off}} my hat from a lunch party last summer, and in to-day's note {{he said he}} wouldn't steal my new hat this time.

5000|$|Sermon 60, Ali {{was trying}} to delay the war (at the Battle of Siffin). Some people thought that Ali <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> of death, this sermon was a reply to those people. [...] "It is not right {{for you to say}} that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> hesitating to start the war <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> of death.

6000|$|... "Indeed I do; and I'm {{so glad to}} {{hear you}} say that, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> you'd long to be off to the old ways, and all I've tried to do would be undone. Would you like to go back, Ben?" [...] and Miss Celia held his chin an instant, to watch the brown face that looked so {{honestly}} back at her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Unlikely {{as it may}} seem, I can," [...] said Murray. [...] "I {{have never}} confessed it to Mrs. Emory, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> she would inveigle me into milking her {{fourteen}} cows. But I don't mind helping you.

6000|$|... "I know it, and I don't mean to, but it's so {{much easier}} to get along if you ain't very fussy about being exactly true.

6000|$|... “You will observe there,” I said, “a slight {{trembling}}.

But my spirit masters the trembling flesh and the qualms of the mind. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> more than brave. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> courageous. Your flesh <b>is</b> not <b>afraid.</b> You <b>are</b> not <b>afraid.</b> On the one hand, it costs you nothing to encounter danger; on the other hand, it even gives you delight. You enjoy it. You may be unafraid, Mr. Larsen, but you must grant that the bravery is mine.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I'm timid, very timid indeed. I'm {{afraid of}} almost everything. <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> foolish not to <b>be.</b> It <b>is</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> alive and happy right now. I hope <b>I</b> shall never <b>be</b> less timid than <b>I</b> <b>am</b> now, for {{it would mean}} {{that sooner or later}} I would fail to run in time and would be gobbled up. It isn't cowardly to be timid when there is danger all around. Nor is it bravery to take a foolish and needless risk. So I seldom go far from home. It isn't safe for me, and I know it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Erich Fromm contends that, [...] "The term 'the unconscious' is {{actually}} a mystification (even though one might use it for reasons of convenience, as <b>I</b> <b>am</b> guilty of doing in these pages). There {{is no such thing}} as the unconscious; there are only experiences of which we are aware, and others of which we are not aware, that is, of which we <b>are</b> unconscious. If <b>I</b> hate a man <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>afraid</b> of him, and if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> aware of my hate but not of my fear, we may say that my hate is conscious and that my fear is unconscious; still my fear does not lie in that mysterious place: 'the' unconscious." ...|$|R

6000|$|I {{had made}} some harangues upon the {{delightful}} retirement of a country life, and how we might enjoy ourselves so effectually without the encumbrances of business and the world; but all this was grimace, and purely <b>because</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>afraid</b> to make any public appearance in the world, for fear some impertinent person of quality should chop upon me again and cry out, [...] "Roxana, Roxana, by ----!"
