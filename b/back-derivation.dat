While not {{technically}} named after the saint (Sakartvelo is the Georgian name for the country), its English name is an early and well-attested <b>back-derivation</b> of Saint George. The name is reputed to be an anglicisation of Gurj, derived from the Persian word for the frightening and heroic people in that territory, and hence assumed by early medieval chroniclers to translate as George, due to the existing patronage.|$|E
