50|$|One of {{the most}} {{influential}} pieces to the transformation of Senegal’s healthcare system in the late 1990s was the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative.</b> The <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> started in 1987, when health ministers from two dozen African countries met with representatives of WHO and UNICEF to discuss the limited success of health care strategies in Africa and the need for intervention. At the conference, leaders agreed to provide a minimum of health care services with severely reduced social services budgets. As a result of the meeting, major changes to Senegal’s health system occurred. The meeting resulted in the decentralization of Senegal’s health sector, which some critics believe has brought about chaos in local governments and administration in Senegal.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> {{also led}} to the {{establishment}} of health committees in Senegal in 1992. The committees strive to meet three central goals: to promote health of their community, to mobilize the community around health development, and {{to improve the quality of}} services rendered at their health post, clinic, or hospital. In practice, the committees have not been completely representative, and have become problematic to clinic staff and medical personnel. Women have been almost entirely absent from committee elections and seldom are selected for committee boards. Rather, these boards are held by males who may ignore the needs of women, children, and the disadvantaged in their committees. Critics believe the committees have been characterized by mismanagement, mistrust, and a lack of transparency. Despite these issues, there have been significant gains from the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> and health committees. The changes have led to the improved availability of pharmaceuticals, and have also made up for the shortage of health personnel in many instances.|$|E

5000|$|The Donabedian {{model is}} a {{conceptual}} model that provides a framework for examining health services and evaluating quality of health care. According to the model, information about quality of care {{can be drawn from}} three categories: “structure,” “process,” and “outcomes." [...] Structure describes the context in which care is delivered, including hospital buildings, staff, financing, and equipment. Process denotes the transactions between patients and providers throughout the delivery of healthcare. Finally, outcomes refer to the effects of healthcare on the health status of patients and populations. Avedis Donabedian, a physician and health services researcher at the University of Michigan, developed the original model in 1966. While there are other quality of care frameworks, including the World Health Organization (WHO)-Recommended Quality of Care Framework and the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative,</b> the Donabedian Model continues to be the dominant paradigm for assessing the quality of health care.|$|E
50|$|In the pre-genocide era before 1994, Rwanda's {{healthcare}} {{was supported}} by the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> which was sponsored by UNICEF and WHO and adopted by African ministers of health in 1987. Progress was started towards decentralising the health management system, first to the Province level and then to the district level. Unfortunately this was disrupted by the 1994 genocide, which crippled the healthcare system alongside the economy. In the post genocide period, Rwanda has had an uphill climb in the recovery of its health system as well as its economy. However, it has since built one of the best healthcare systems in the region. In 2008, the government spent 9.7% of national expenditure on healthcare, compared with 3.2% in 1996. Health insurance became mandatory for all individuals in 2008; in 2010 over 90% of the population was covered. In 2012, only about 4% were uninsured.|$|E

Only one in three mothers had access to child health care services. The <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> changed that dramatically by introducing community-based health care reform, resulting in more efficient and equitable provision of services. , Benin had the 34th highest rate of maternal mortality in the world. According to a 2013 UNICEF report, 13% of women had undergone female genital mutilation.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to changes with the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> and decentralization, Senegalese healthcare has become privatized. Privatization in Senegal {{has meant that}} user fees and the sales of pharmaceuticals finance {{a significant part of}} the health sector. [...] The state still funds the health sector by paying salaries of state employees and giving each district a discretionary budget each year that it decides. However, user fees and pharmaceutical sales are only the most evident parts of the privatized health system in Senegal. Now, patients must buy a ticket to stand in line and receive care at a health clinic, which can be particularly problematic for mothers, the elderly, and the poorest of the poor. Moreover, hospitals require even more available cash. The effects of privatization in have especially disadvantaged women, because they typically manage the health of the household. Additionally, many preventable deaths have occurred as a direct result of privatization.|$|E

5000|$|... 1987 At {{the conference}} of African Ministers of Health in Bamako, Mali, {{it was found that}} there were many {{weaknesses}} in centralization. All decisions were made at high levels. Local communities had no forum to voice concerns of weak coverage and the lack of services available. Also within the health infrastructure, {{it was found that the}} cost of services were high, as were levels of death. L’Initiative de Bamako (IB) - The <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> was therefore developed based on decentralizing resources in order to reinforce the ideology of Primary Health Care - Soins de Santé Primaires (SSP). This system gave the responsibility for the management of their own healthcare entirely to the community level. Les Soins de Santé Primaires (SSP) - Primary Health Care was essentially based on practical techniques and methodology. Scientifically valuable and socially acceptable, the system was rendered universally accessible to individuals and families in the community. The country could then assume autonomy and self-determination in each step of their health development.|$|E
50|$|Decentralization {{began in}} the late 1990s, {{following}} the <b>Bamako</b> <b>initiative.</b> The key goal has been to make the state more responsive and adaptable to local and regional needs, as opposed to when administrative power and responsibility were concentrated more centrally. This has resulted in more accountability and real power on part of local officials. The state funds {{a significant portion of the}} local health budget, but health targets, goals, and interventions are determined at the local level. However, because most local officials have no training on how decentralization should work; there has been a vacuum in terms of planning and management, and weak institutional capacity and the few resources to allocate among increasing responsibilities have exacerbated issues. Decentralization has failed in two major ways: the first three years failed to render politics and local government more participatory and more responsive to local communities, and there has been no attention to gender equality and participation. Decentralization has meant that authorities have completely failed to engage with women’s situations and concerns. There have been additional issues in creating conflicts between city officials and medical district officers over disbursement of money for the health sector.|$|E
5000|$|A Health Policy and Planning {{article by}} Hardon (1990; 5: 186-189) {{describes}} the initiative as follows: The <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> {{is a joint}} World Health Organization/ United Nations Children's Fund (WHO/UNICEF) Initiative aimed at solving {{the problems in the}} financing of primary health care in sub-Saharan Africa. It was launched in September 1987 at a regional WHO meeting, where Mr Grant, director of UNICEF, dealt with the severe economic crises facing sub-Saharan Africa, the negative effects of adjustment programmes on health, and the reluctance of donors to continue to fund recurrent costs of primary health care programmes. He outlined his vision of how primary health care could be revitalized by generating funds in communities through the sales of drugs at a price considerably higher than cost.Following this speech, the African ministers of health present at the meeting adopted a resolution in which they called for the acceleration of primary health care by: * defining and implementing self-financing mechanisms at district level * encouraging social mobilization and * ensuring a regular supply of drugs. Positive experience with revolving drug funds was cited as a reason for the implementation of community financing mechanisms that rely on revenue out of the sales of drugs.|$|E

The question is raised whether paying for health care is culturally acceptable in African communities. The author argues that 'money' {{is not a new}} phenomenon in Africa and that paying for goods and services does not need to conflict with existing traditions of reciprocity in the field of health care. Money is an artifact which is culturally incorporated in a creative manner to satisfy specific needs. Cultural objections to paying for health care, therefore, are unlikely to exist, but how payment should be realised in an effective and just way is another question. primary health care money <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> Africa...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the perceptions and practices of health workers and households in relation to community participation in the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> programme (BI). The study was conducted in Oji River local government area of South-East Nigeria where the BI program has been operational since 1993. A pre-tested questionnaire was used to collect information from 20 health workers charged with operating the BI in 20 health centres. In addition, focus group discussions were conducted with members of the district and village health committees. Community participation from both health worker and community perspectives seem to have been enhanced by the introduction of BI, despite some constraints. However, the communities were not involved in core areas of community participation, and the health workers seem to be resisting their participation fully. It is concluded the community participation in BI could be improved if expectations were made explicit. This improvement should take into consideration the desires and priorities of the communities and issues impeding participation should be addressed.

40|$|Although the {{availability}} of pharmaceuticals is critical for both curative and preventive health care, drugs are, at best, sporadically available in governmental facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. The religious mission and private sectors are more successful than the public sector in obtaining and distributing drugs. The public sector operates under a myriad of constraints inherent in a bureaucracy; the religious missions have the advantages of better management and access to foreign currency; {{the private sector is}} innately efficient. Donor assistance to increase {{the availability}} of drugs in the public sector has included support for revolving drug funds, national drug services, the improvement of management techniques, and the local production of pharmaceuticals. None of these interventions has been notably successful. In 1987, UNICEF presented The <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> [...] a proposal to launch an internationally-financed fund for essential drugs for sub-Saharan Africa. However, the proposal is unrealistic in anticipating that the requisite resources and/or hard currency can be raised to support the proposal. As the private sector is a more efficient distributor, it is recommended that the private sector be given responsibility for the distribution of drugs. Nonetheless, some governmental controls will be necessary to ensure that essential drugs are available at the least cost to the consumer. pharmaceutical availability private sector distribution financing essential drugs <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a study to assess the quality of {{maternal}} health care in public health facilities in Nigeria and to identify the resource implications of making the necessary quality improvements. Drawing upon unifying themes from quality assurance, basic microeconomics and the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative,</b> locally defined norms were used to estimate resource requirements for {{improving the quality of}} maternal health care. Wide gaps existed between what is required (the norm) and what was available in terms of fixed and variable resources required for the delivery of maternal health services in public facilities implementing the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> in the Local Government Areas studied. Given such constraints, it was highly unlikely that technically acceptable standards of care could be met without additional resource inputs to meet the norm. This is part of {{the cost of doing business}} and merits serious policy dialogue. Revenue generation from health services was poor and appeared to be more related to inadequate supply of essential drugs and consumables than to the use of uneconomic fee scales. It is likely that user fees will be necessary to supplement scarce government budgets, especially to fund the most critical variable inputs associated with quality improvements. However, any user fee system, especially one that raises fees to patients, will have to be accompanied by immediate and"visible quality im-provements. Without such quality improvements, cost recovery will result in even lower utilization and attempts to generate new revenues are unlikely to succeed...|$|E
40|$|In West Africa, {{the famous}} "{{implementation}} gap" concept applies to health policies. During {{the implementation of}} the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> (BI), the actors were drawn to policies solely for their orientation towards efficiency, thereby neglecting the equity aspects. This paper aims to present an in-depth understanding of this situation, developed through a case study and socio-anthropological fieldwork. The study is informed by a policy framework of analysis that integrates streams theory and the anthropology of development. Multiple sources of data were used: concept mapping (2), in-depth interviews (24), informal interviews (60), focus groups (4), document analysis, and field observation (7 months). The results indicate that the equity aspect of health policies was omitted during training on the use of proceedings from drug sales and user fees; donor agencies and NGOs were more preoccupied with efficiency than equity; the peripheral actors were not driven to ensure that indigents had free access to health care; society was not concerned with the sub-groups of the population; centralized decisions were taken without consultation, remained vague, and were not followed-up; and the concept of equity was perceived differently from those who devised policies. I offer a threefold explanation of why equity was neglected. First, the "windows of opportunity" for achieving equity goals were not seized, at least at the point that led to real change. Second, the policy entrepreneurs did not take on the task of coupling the problem streams with the solutions streams, which is necessary for a successful implementation. Third, the situation of the indigents did not exhibit the necessary characteristics for them to be considered a public problem. For scientific and social reasons it is urgent that we find a solution to halt the exclusion to health care among the poorest groups.

40|$|The {{success of}} {{strategies}} to revitalize {{primary health care}} services such as those advocated by the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> requires a response adapted to {{the expectations of the}} population, especially in terms of quality. The goal of this study, conducted in two rural communities in Guinea, was to identify, characterize, and classify the criteria that the public uses to judge the quality of primary health care (PHC) services. This study included 180 participants in 21 focus group discussions. Forty-four main criteria were identified. These criteria vary depending on the respondents' sex and age, and their ability to access primary health care services. Some of the criteria correspond to those used by health care providers, while others do not. The general public places considerable emphasis on outcomes, but little emphasis on preventive services. The users appear very sensitive to aspects of the interpersonal relations they have with professionals and the technical quality of the care provided. A taxonomy of perceived quality is developed, which includes the following five categories: (1) technical competence of the health care personnel; (2) interpersonal relations between the patients and care providers; (3) availability and adequacy of resources and services; (4) accessibility and (5) effectiveness of care. It is a major challenge to refocus on quality in the development of health care services. This will require considerable changes for which training may be an effective, but certainly not a sufficient means. Promoting professionalism and changing the relations between public authorities and the general public are the only means of improving the quality of health care services as well as user perception. quality of health services community perceptions primary health care services focus group discussions developing countries <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative...</b>|$|E

40|$|Many {{developing}} countries, {{particularly in}} Africa, have recently introduced payment schemes {{based on the}} selling of essential drugs. This {{is one of the}} main elements of the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> according to which the income generated would ensure a reliable supply of drugs and would improve other aspects of the quality of the services offered. Thus, quality improvements would compensate for the financial barrier and as a result the utilization of public health services would be increased or at least maintained. These hypotheses have proven to be partially valid, since there have been cases where the utilization of health services has increased and others where it has decreased; these inconclusive results have fuelled criticisms concerning the inequitable nature of these measures. This longitudinal study in a rural community of Zaïre shows that the utilization of health services had diminished by close to 40 % over 5 yr (1987 - 1991) and that 18 - 32 % of this decrease is explained by cost. The regular supply of drugs and the improvement in the technical quality of the services [...] technical qualification of the staff, allocation of microscopes, and renovation of the infrastructures [...] was not enough to compensate for the additional financial barriers created by the increased cost of services. However, on a local level, the interpersonal qualities displayed by some of the nurses sometimes helped to compensate for the negative effects of the costs, and even to increase the level of utilization of some health centres. The quality of public services has often been neglected in developing countries. While some attention is given to technical qualities, the interpersonal components of the quality of the services are generally ignored or underestimated by planners and they are the very components which are most resistant to change. It will be a major challenge for health systems to address this issue of quality of care in order to minimize the negative impact of the introduction of user payment schemes. Therefore, now is the time to place quality next to coverage in planners' agendas. <b>Bamako</b> <b>initiative</b> utilization of health services quality costs qualitative methods quantitative methods...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background African {{policy-makers}} {{are increasingly}} considering abolishing user fees {{as a solution}} to improve access to health care systems. There is little evidence on this subject in West Africa, and particularly in countries that have organized their healthcare system {{on the basis of the}} <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative.</b> This article presents a process evaluation of an NGO intervention to abolish user fees in Niger for children under five years and pregnant women. Methods The intervention was launched in 2006 in two health districts and 43 health centres. The intervention consisted of abolishing user fees and improving the quality of services (drugs, ambulance, etc.). We carried out a process evaluation in April 2007 using qualitative and quantitative data. Three data collection methods were used: i) individual in-depth interviews (n = 85) and focus groups (n = 8); ii) participant observation in 12 health centres; and iii) self-administered structured questionnaires (n = 51 health staff). Results The population favoured abolition; health officials and local decision-makers were in favour, but they worried about its sustainability. Among health workers, opposition to providing free services was more widespread. The strengths of the process were: a top-down phase of information and raising community awareness; appropriate incentive measures; a good drug supply system; and the organization of a medical evacuation system. The major weaknesses of the process were: the perverse effects of incentive bonuses; the lack of community-based management committees' involvement in the management; the creation of a system running in parallel with the BI system; the lack of action to support the service offer; and the poor coordination of the availability of free services at different levels of the health pyramid. Some unintended outcomes are also documented. Conclusion The linkages between systems in which some patients pay (<b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative)</b> and some do not should be carefully considered and organized in accordance with the local reality. For the poorest patients to really benefit, it is essential that, at the same time, the quality of services be improved and mechanisms be put in place to prevent abuses. Much remains to be done to generate knowledge on the processes for abolishing fees in West Africa. </p...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To assess {{community}} perception, {{practices and}} satisfaction {{with the quality of}} maternal and child health services and the willingness and ability to pay for the services, after the introduction of the <b>Bamako</b> <b>initiative</b> programme. Design: A cross sectional study using pre-tested questionnaire and focus group discussions was undertaken in May 1999. Variables explored were rating of quality of services, level of satisfaction with the services and willingness to pay for quality improvements as well as ability to pay for services. Setting: Oji-river local government area of Enugu State, Nigeria. Subjects: A random sample of 405 households from a sample frame of primary health care house numbers and another purposive sample of women and males were involved. Results: Most respondents (90. 6 %) rated the services to be at least good. Another 95. 9 %, 94. 3 % and 95. 8 % of the respondents were, satisfied with the childhood immunisation, antenatal care and childbirth services respectively.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{gauge the}} effects of {{operating}} the <b>Bamako</b> <b>Initiative</b> in Kongoussi district, Burkina Faso. METHODS: Qualitative and quasi-experimental quantitative methodologies were used. FINDINGS: Following the introduction of fees-for-services in July 1997, the number of consultations for curative care fell {{over a period of}} three years by an average of 15. 4 % at "case" health centres but increased by 30. 5 % at "control" health centres. Moreover, although the operational results for essential drugs depots were not known, expenditure increased on average 2. 7 times more than income and did not keep pace with the decline in the utilization of services. Persons in charge of the management committees had difficulties in releasing funds to ensure access to care for the poor. CONCLUSION: The introduction of fees-for-services had an adverse effect on service utilization. The study district {{is in a position to}} bear the financial cost of taking care of the poor and the community is able to identify such people. Incentives must be introduced by the state and be swiftly applied so that the communities agree to a more equitable system and thereby allow access to care for those excluded from services because they are unable to pay...|$|E
