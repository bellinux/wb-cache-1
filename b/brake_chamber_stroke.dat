To {{solve the}} problem of {{measuring}} the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> at present, this integrative performance test system for bake chamber was built up by using the computer control technology. It can measure these parameters: dynamic characteristic, static characteristic, sealing performance and return performance. To verify the system accuracy, a multi-parameter dynamic simulation model for the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> was designed based on AMESim. It breaks through the limit which was formerly difficult to analyze the defects of the theoretical parameters for <b>brake</b> <b>chamber.</b> By the simulation models and test system, the influence of the key component parameters to the output characteristic is analyzed. The experiment results show that the integrative performance of <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> can be judged very well and the simulation model is accurate and reliable...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{is focused on}} developing a control scheme for regulating the pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> of an air brake system found in most commercial vehicles like trucks, tractor-trailers and buses. Such a control scheme {{can be used for}} providing the ground work for future systems such as forward collision avoidance systems, advanced anti-lock brake systems and differential braking systems. The development of this controller involves two tasks. The first task was the development of a control scheme for achieving the desired pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber.</b> This scheme was based on a mathematical model of the treadle valve of the air brake system. The second task was the implementation of this control scheme on the experimental facility that was set up at Texas A&M University.

50|$|With {{a service}} brake relay valve installed, the hose that {{connects to the}} primary delivery-port output of the foot-valve becomes a control-line (i.e., The air from the foot-valve “dead ends” at the relay valve's control-port.). Only low-volume air-signals are {{required}} to travel {{back and forth between}} the foot-valve's delivery port and the relay valve's control port; therefore, the air-volume supplied by the delivery port is now only a tiny-fraction of what otherwise would have been required had the relay valve not been installed. This reduces the delay between the application of the front and rear brakes to only a fraction of a second. When the driver depresses the brake pedal, a small amount of air momentarily opens the relay valve's supply port, which then directs air from the remote air-supply directly to the rear service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers,</b> and quickly applies the rear service brakes. The pressure delivered to the service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers</b> in this manner will equal the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve to the relay valve. When the driver partially or fully releases the brake pedal, the control-pressure delivered by the foot-valve decreases; this causes the relay valve's supply port to close, and its exhaust port to momentarily open, thus preventing a pneumatic short-circuit from occurring while the air exhausts from all rear service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers.</b>|$|R

40|$|Statistics {{indicate}} that defects in brake system {{contribute significantly to}} fatal crashes involving commercial vehicles. Hence {{there is a need}} for developing preventive and active safety measures for assessing the performance of an air brake system in trucks. Existing techniques for assessing the performance of brakes are infrastructure intensive, time and labor intensive. The premise of this thesis is that model-based diagnostic techniques can be employed to overcome these limitations of existing tech- niques. The design of a model-based diagnostic system requires the development and experimental corroboration of a mathematical model of the evolution of pressure in each <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> of a truck in response to the application of brake pedal input by the driver, when there are no faults or defects in the brake system. This thesis is aimed at modeling and experimentally corroborating a subsystem of an air brake system, namely the pneumatic relay valve.

50|$|In a truck’s {{air brake}} system, relay valves get a signal when a driver presses the treadle, which then opens the valve and allows air {{to enter the}} <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> via air inlet.

Next, it moves the disc, wedge or s-cam, which pushes the brake shoes and lining, creating friction. This friction slows and eventually stops the brake drum’s turning, which stops the wheel.|$|R
50|$|Without relay valves, {{it would}} take too long for {{sufficient}} air to travel from the brake pedal valve {{to the rear of}} the truck or trailer in order to apply the rear service brakes concurrently with the front service brakes, resulting in a condition known as brake lag. To correct this condition on a long-wheel-base vehicle, a relay valve is installed near the rear service <b>brake</b> <b>chambers.</b> In tractors as well as straight-trucks, a remote air-supply is provided in the form of a large diameter pipe connected between the primary reservoir and the relay valve for remote service brake application.|$|R

5000|$|Air {{brake systems}} are {{typically}} used on heavy trucks and buses. The system consists of service brakes, parking brakes, a control pedal, and an air storage tank. For the parking brake, there's a disc or drum brake arrangement {{which is designed}} to be held in the 'applied' position by spring pressure. Air pressure must be produced to release these [...] "spring brake" [...] parking brakes. For the service brakes (the ones used while driving for slowing or stopping) to be applied, the brake pedal is pushed, routing the air under pressure (approx [...] or 6.89-8.27 bar) to the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber,</b> causing the <b>brake</b> to be engaged. Most types of truck air brakes are drum brakes, though there is an increasing trend towards the use of disc brakes in this application.

A mechanical [...] "wig wag" [...] that automatically drops down into the driver's field of vision when the pressure drops below a certain point is also common. Setting of the parking/emergency brake releases the pressurized air in the lines between the compressed air storage tank and the brakes, thus allowing the spring actuated parking brake to engage. A sudden loss of air pressure would result in full spring brake pressure immediately.|$|R

40|$|Heavy goods {{vehicles}} exhibit poor {{braking performance}} in emergency situations {{when compared to}} other vehicles. Part of the problem is caused by sluggish pneumatic brake actuators, which limit the control bandwidth of their antilock braking systems. In addition, heuristic control algorithms are used that do not achieve the maximum braking force throughout the stop. In this article, a novel braking system is introduced for pneumatically braked heavy goods vehicles. The conventional brake actuators are improved by placing high-bandwidth, binary-actuated valves directly on the <b>brake</b> <b>chambers.</b> A made-for-purpose valve is described. It achieves a switching delay of 3 – 4 [*]ms in tests, which is an order of magnitude faster than solenoids in conventional anti-lock braking systems. The heuristic braking control algorithms are replaced with a wheel slip regulator based on sliding mode control. The combined actuator and slip controller are shown to reduce stopping distances on smooth and rough, high friction (μ[*]=[*] 0. 9) surfaces by 10 % and 27 % respectively in hardware-in-the-loop tests compared with conventional ABS. On smooth and rough, low friction (μ[*]=[*] 0. 2) surfaces, stopping distances are reduced by 23 % and 25 %, respectively. Moreover, the overall air reservoir size required on a heavy goods vehicle is governed by its air usage during an anti-lock braking stop on a low friction, smooth surface. The 37 % reduction in air usage observed in hardware-in-the-loop tests on this surface therefore represents the potential reduction in reservoir size that could be achieved by the new system...|$|R

50|$|A {{spring brake}} relay valve {{works on the}} same {{principle}} as the service brake relay valve, although it has the opposite effect. This type of relay valve responds to a major drop in pressure at its control-port by opening its exhaust port, which causes the air from each spring <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> under its control to remotely exhaust, thus applying the spring brakes much-more-quickly than would otherwise be possible if the air were required to discharge via the yellow parking-control valve on the dashboard. In a dual-circuit air brake system, air from both the primary and secondary reservoirs is fed into the supply-port of the parking-control valve, {{as well as the}} supply-port of this relay valve; it is merged via yet another two-way check valve. The delivery-port output of the parking-control valve connects to the control-port of this relay valve; this enables the spring brakes to be controlled via this valve. The merged air from the parking-control valve prevents air-loss from only one braking circuit from causing the spring brakes to automatically apply. This gives the driver more control, and prevents the vehicle from grinding to a halt in an unsafe location. However, with this increased control, comes increased responsibility {{on the part of the}} driver: If air is lost from the primary circuit alone, the spring brakes must be manually applied by the driver via the parking-control valve; otherwise, the front service brakes may not be enough to stop the vehicle safely in an emergency—especially if the vehicle is heavily loaded, and/or traveling at a high-speed. In fact, the driver's failure to manually apply the spring brakes in this situation could lead to catastrophic failure of the front brakes due to overheating, since it could cause the front service brakes to exceed their design-limit for energy absorption.QR1C air valve speeds up the process, with anti compounding, meaning trailer and service brakes will function 1 second between each other.The relay valve's function is analogous to the transistor used in electronic circuits.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks. Brake systems in trucks are crucial for ensuring the safety of vehicles and passengers on the roadways. Most trucks in the US are equipped with S-cam drum brake systems and they are sensitive to maintenance. Brake defects such as leaks are a major cause of accidents involving trucks. Leaks in the air brake systems affect braking performance drastically by decreasing the peak braking pressures attained and also increasing the time required to attain the same, thereby resulting in longer stopping distances. Hence {{there is a need for}} detecting leaks in an air brake system. In this thesis, a mathematical model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks is developed with a view towards developing an automatic leak detection system in the near future. The model developed here builds on an earlier research at Texas A&M University in which a "fault free" model of an air brake system is developed, i. e., a mathematical model of an air brake system that predicts how the pressure in the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> evolves as a function of the brake pedal input when there are no leaks in the air brake system. In order to develop a model for an air brake system in the presence of leaks, one must characterize a "leak". A leak may be characterized by the location and its size. Since the pipes are short, the location of the leak does not significantly affect the evolution in the brake pressure as much as its size. For this reason, "effective area" of the leak was chosen as a characteristic of the leak. It was estimated by fitting an empirical relation for leak with leak flow measurement data. The supply pressure and effective area of leak comprised the inputs to the model along with the displacement of the foot pedal (treadle valve plunger). The model was corroborated with the experimental data collected using the setup at Texas A&M University...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} the development of a model-based diagnostic system for air brake systems that are widely used in commercial vehicles, such as trucks, tractor-trailers, buses, etc. The performance of these brake systems is sensitive to maintenance and hence they require frequent inspections. Current inspection techniques require an inspector to go underneath a vehicle to check the brake system for possible faults, such as leaks, worn brake pads, out-of-adjustment of push rods, etc. Such inspections are time consuming, labor intensive and difficult to perform on vehicles with a low ground clearance. In this context, the development of an onboard/ handheld diagnostic tool for air brakes would be of significant value. Such a tool would automate the brake inspection process, thereby reducing the inspection time and improving the safety of operation of commercial vehicles. In this dissertation, diagnostic schemes are developed to automatically detect two important and prevalent faults that can occur in air brake systems ?????? leaks and out-of-adjustment of push rods. These diagnostic schemes are developed based on a nonlinear model for the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system that correlates the pressure transients in the <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> with the supply pressure to the treadle valve and the displacement of the treadle valve plunger. These diagnostic schemes have been corroborated with data obtained from the experimental facility at Texas A&M University and the results are presented. The response of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system is such that it can be classified as what is known as a ??????Sequential Hybrid System??????. In this dissertation, the term ??????hybrid systems?????? is used to denote those systems whose mathematical representation involves a finite set of governing ordinary differential equations corresponding to a finite set of modes of operation. The problem of estimating the push rod stroke is posed as a parameter estimation problem and a transition detection problem involving the hybrid model of the pneumatic subsystem of the air brake system. Also, parameter estimation schemes for a class of sequential hybrid systems are developed. The efficacy of these schemes is illustrated with some examples...|$|R

Accidents involving commercial vehicles have disastrous consequences; most of the times they result in human fatalities, environmental damage, traffic congestion leading to fuel wastage and associated productivity losses. Moreover, with the rapid increase in the commercial vehicles traffic over the past few years, improved preventive and active measures are necessary to minimize commercial vehicle accidents and to enhance the safety of our roadways. The brake system is one of the critical components in ensuring the safety of the vehicle on the road. In a recent National Traffic Safety Board's (NTSB) heavy truck inspection survey, {{it was found that the}} defects in brakes/brake adjustment account for an average 56 percent of the trucks being declared out of service. Worn brake pads and tires, air leaks at hoses, connections, valves and <b>brake</b> <b>chambers</b> of the airbrake system along with the significant time delay in the actuation of tractor and trailer brakes degrade the vehicle braking and handling performance thereby increasing the potential for fatal accidents. As a result, there is a need for the advanced diagnostic system that monitors the health of air brakes and thus aiding in preventing the accidents. Therefore, the research is to develop a diagnostic algorithm that enhance the preventive safety of the vehicle. This could be accomplished by developing a mathematical model for the air brake system of a commercial vehicle and then utilizing the fault detection algorithms using analytical redundancy in a dynamic system. This could be done by predicting the redundant measurements using some of the reliable sensors and comparing with that of the values from the model. Using the mismatch between these, error residuals can be generated that carry the signature of the health of the airbrake system. The algorithm could also be experimentally implemented and verify their efficacy on an air brake system in the laboratory. The focus of the work that is presented here is to develop a mathematical model of the air brake systems that suits the development of the diagnostic algorithm and also to set up a test bench for the experiments...|$|R

40|$|MIng (Mechanical Engineering), Potchefstroom University for Christian Higher Education, 2003 A {{conventional}} {{muzzle brake}} is a baffle device located at some distance {{in front of}} the muzzle exit of a gun. The purpose of a muzzle brake is to alleviate the force on the weapon platform by diverting a portion of the muzzle gas resulting in a forward impulse being exerted on the recoiling parts of the weapon. A very efficient muzzle brake unfortunately gives rise to an excessive overpressure in the crew environment due to the deflection of the emerging shock waves. The novel active muzzle brake of this dissertation is based on a concept developed by Qinetiq. The novel technique involves the main <b>brake</b> <b>chamber</b> being closed for {{a very short period of}} time after the projectile has uncorked from the barrel eliminating the main emerging shock wave from developing to full strength with the result that the novel muzzle brake gives rise to a very low overpressure. This has the advantage that the gun crew suffers from less strain to the ears and vulnerable organs. Inherently the novel brake suffers a loss in efficiency due to the chamber being closed for a while and a method had to be developed to improve the efficiency of the conventional part. This dissertation deals with the development of a novel active muzzle brake intended for a 155 mm artillery weapon, but scaled to an 88 mm 25 pounder G 1 as an interim phase. Several constraints and requirements have been set regarding the physical properties and performance criteria of the prototypes. The interim phase of the project was executed within three years in which six prototypes were developed and evaluated. Major challenges in the development were to design a control and restoring mechanism that would survive the harsh conditions at muzzle exit and to enhance the efficiency. The establishment of linear movement of the closure mechanism and friction springs as the restoring mechanism was a major breakthrough in this respect. The first four prototypes were designed using empirical data and first order modeling as background while a CFD technique was used to refine the last two prototypes. Of the six prototypes developed, the first two were unsuccessful in demonstrating the novel technique. The one was unable to survive the muzzle exit conditions and the control mechanism on the second muzzle brake opened too soon. Of the remaining four, the last prototype passed all the specified constraints and proved to be a candidate for the 155 mm upgrade. Not only was the structure robust enough, the general appearance of the novel muzzle brake is futuristic. This prototype is also a candidate if a much more efficient muzzle brake, with similar overpressure characteristics of a less efficient muzzle brake, is needed. Master...|$|R

Currently a presence of leak in the system is detected for the severities of leak that cause the reservoir pressure to drop below a threshold, such as, the leakage of compressed air due to rupture of the reservoir or of the hoses carrying the compressed air. The leakage of air is also possible due to several other reasons such as, cracks in the hoses, loose couplings between the hoses etc. The severities of leak, corresponding to such situations, do not lead to the reservoir pressure drop below the threshold; therefore, their presence remains undetected. For the detection and estimation of such severities of leak, a diagnostic scheme has been given and is based on a model developed for the mass ow rate of the leakage of air from the air brake system. Out-of-adjustment of the pushrod is the extension of pushrod beyond a prede- ned value and for safety concerns, an extension beyond this value is not desired. Currently no warning system is available for monitoring the out-of-adjustment of pushrod, except, during the safety inspection. Inspection of the pushrod for outof- adjustment is the most labor-intensive and time consuming task during a typical safety inspection procedure. For efficient and continuous monitoring of the pushrod for out-of-adjustment, a diagnostic algorithm for estimating the steady-state pushrod stroke has been developed. The scheme is expected to expedite the inspection process for the out-of-adjustment of pushrod. Experimental data from the air brake test setup at Texas A and M University has been used for corroborating both the models. Also, the problem of parameter estimation of sequential hybrid systems such as the air brake system, has been addressed. The " nature of the air brake system stems from the system being in di erent modes corresponding to di erent values of the displacement of the pushrod and is a result of di erent spring compliances associated with the pushrod in di erent ranges of its displacement. The air brake system is " in the sense that as the pressure increases, the displacement of the pushrod increases and there is a distinct sequence of modes that the system will transition through and upon a reduction in pressure, the sequence of modes is revisited in the reverse order. The mode to mode transition of the air brake system is governed by the parameters, such as, the clearance between the brake pad and the brake drum. The problem of estimation, that has been addressed, is as follows: Suppose the pressure in the air brake system were to be measured and that the motion of the pushrod is not measured. Is it possible to estimate the nal displacement of the pushrod without knowing the parameters, such as the clearance, that govern the system to transition from one mode to another...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{ventricular}} assist device (HIA-EMLVAD-AT 1, Helmholtz Institute Aachen-electromechanical Left Ventricular Assist Device-Animal Test Version 1), {{driven by}} a uniformly and unidirectionally rotating actuator and a patented hypocycloidic pusherplate displacement gear unit, was developed and tested in an acute animal experiment. The excellent free filling behavior of the pump <b>chamber</b> with a <b>stroke</b> volume of 65 ml is obtained by a 2 : 3 ejection-filling time relationship. The uniform motor rotation facilitates simple sensorless pre and afterload detection by motor current analysis. In contrast to common apical cannulation, the inlet cannula was placed via the left atrium through the mitral valve into the left ventricle. This connection mode is preferable for left ventricular recovery and preservation. Left atrial, left ventricular, and aortic pressure curves, as well as pulmonary artery flow data, were obtained. The data show very effective unloading of the natural ventricle and demonstrate the feasibility of this novel assist device. Directions for further improvement of technical features were also identified...|$|R
5000|$|Pistons {{are made}} of forged {{aluminum}}. They have three rings and aluminum buttons retain the 1.156 x 3.300 in steel wrist pin. The piston is anodized and Teflon coated to prevent galling during the high thrust load operation encounterd. The top ring is an L-shaped section [...] "Dykes" [...] ring that provides a good seal during combustion but a second ring must be used to prevent excessive oil from entering the combustion <b>chamber</b> during intake <b>strokes</b> as the Dykes-style ring offers less than optimal reverse gas/oil sealing. The third ring is an oil scraper ring whose function is to scrape {{the majority of the}} oil film off of the cylinder wall as the piston descends, to prevent oil being exposed to combustion heat and contaminating the upcoming round of fuel/air. This [...] "oil scraping" [...] also provides a key heat removal step for the cylinder walls and piston skirts, the oil film is renewed as the piston moves upward after BDC.|$|R
50|$|In April 1935 three prototypes of the F-22 were ready, two of {{them with}} split-trail carriages. All prototypes had muzzle <b>brakes</b> and {{lengthened}} <b>chambers</b> for a new experimental shell (7.1 kg, muzzle velocity 710 m/s, range up to 14,060 m). Factory trials started on 8 May; on 9 June prototypes {{were brought to the}} Sofrinsky firing ground near Moscow. On 14 June the gun, along with other artillery pieces, was demonstrated to the country leaders including Joseph Stalin. The F-22 made a good impression and was sent for ground testing, which was finished on 16 December. In July 1935 the plant was required to produce 10 pieces. In March 1936 four guns were given to the RKKA for testing, which continued until 22 April. Despite some shortcomings, on 11 May 1936 the gun was adopted as the 76 mm divisional gun model 1936 (F-22) (76-мм дивизионная пушка образца 1936 года (Ф-22)). The final model lacked a muzzle brake (which - the army said - raised too much dust, revealing the position of the gun) and was rechambered for the model 1900 cartridge to allow use of old 76.2 mm ammunition.|$|R
