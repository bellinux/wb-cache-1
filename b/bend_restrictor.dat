50|$|A Vertebrae <b>Bend</b> <b>Restrictor</b> (VBR) {{is used in}} the oil and gas {{industry}} as part of offshore deep sea drilling operations. It is designed to prevent damage to an umbilical cable from overbending. It offsets the action of applied loads which could kink or buckle the internal conduits of an umbilical, cable, flexible riser pipe or MUX line.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} Spar designs where pull tubes {{were used}} to board the risers (either export or flowline risers), the pull-tube extended a considerable distance beyond the keel and used a tapered design to form a <b>bend</b> <b>restrictor</b> that supported the riser throughout the riser/hull interface. In a current Spar design, the pull-tube is terminated at the hull keel and the bending loads are carried by a double sided stress-joint in the riser that pivots on a centralizer located {{near the bottom of}} the pull-tube. Essentially, this is an adaptation of the double-sided stress joint used for top tensioned risers exiting the bottom of their buoyancy can stems to the similar condition of an SCR exiting a pull tube terminating at the Spar’s keel. This new pull-tube and SCR configuration can be applied for both Truss and Classic Spars...|$|E
40|$|PublishedFinal report. Power cable {{failures}} for offshore {{marine energy}} applications are {{a growing concern}} since experience from offshore wind has shown repeated failures of inter-array and export cables. These failures may be mitigated by dedicated cable protection systems, such as bend restrictors. This study presents the rationale and the results for accelerated reliability tests of an articulated <b>bend</b> <b>restrictor.</b> The tests are a collaborative effort between the University of Exeter, CPNL Engineering and NSW, supported by the EU Marinet Programme. The tests {{have been carried out}} at full - scale and exposed the static submarine power cable – <b>bend</b> <b>restrictor</b> specimen to mechanical load regimes exceeding the allowable design loads in order to provoke accelerated wear and component failures. The tested load cases combined cyclic bending motions with oscillating tensile forces. A range of acceleration factors have been applied in respect to the 1 : 50 years load case, subjecting each of the three restrictor samples to 25, 000 bending cycles (50, 000 tensile cycles). The static power cable was also loaded beyond its intended use, testing the worst case scenario of repeated dynamic loading, purposely inflicting failure modes for investigation. Throughout the test the static submarine power cable sustained over 77, 000 bending cycles (154, 000 tensile cycles). The test demonstrated the integrity of the cable protection system with quantified wear rates obtained through 3 D scanning of the individual shells. The static power cable also showed a high reliability level. None of the failure modes, mainly fatigue cracks and fretting, identified by cable dissection would have caused direct loss of service. The observed failure modes could also be predicted through numerical load analysis, giving confidence in the utilised mechanical modelling and cross - sectional analysis for dynamic applications. Overall the study shows how dedicated collaborative component testing can make an important contribution to quantify and validate component behaviour in challenging offshore operating environments. The work described in this publication has received support from MARINET, a European Community - Research Infrastructure Action under the FP 7 “Capacities” Specific Programme...|$|E

50|$|Various {{innovative}} {{systems have}} been developed to provide restriction of bending, including ductile iron articulated pipe, and polymer or metal based vertebrae systems. Vertebrae <b>bend</b> <b>restrictors</b> are available in both metal and polymer based forms. Some cable protection systems include a polymer based vertebrae system which restricts the bend radius to a maximum of a few degrees per segment. These systems are lighter than their metal equivalents and often cheaper to produce but must be carefully assessed for longevity in the proposed application. Due to the use of polymers these systems tend to be of a larger diameter than their metal counterparts, which presents a larger surface area for drag induced forces caused by currents.|$|R
