40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThere has been independent oversight {{of law enforcement}} complaints for {{over a hundred years}} in the United States, but recent cases of perceived excessive use of force by law enforcement officers have thrust independent oversight into the national forefront. This thesis set out to discover frameworks, operation methods, and responsibilities of independent oversight of cases involving police excessive use of force by researching the current structures and practices of oversight bodies across America—how they differ from each other, how they are successful—and determining whether there should be a national standard. This research includes <b>oversight</b> <b>boards</b> from small, medium, and large American municipalities with law enforcement agencies whose ethnic diversity is not reflective of their communities. Through the use of a request for information, 12 independent <b>oversight</b> <b>boards</b> were examined. The research suggests there is no consistency across independent <b>oversight</b> <b>boards,</b> no standard for independent <b>oversight</b> <b>board</b> frameworks, and no tracking of their efficiency toward organizational or academically suggested goals. Nor is there a central repository where lessons learned and best practices can be catalogued and distributed. This thesis provides recommendations for future research on independent <b>oversight</b> <b>boards.</b> Captain, Stockton Police Department (CA...|$|R
