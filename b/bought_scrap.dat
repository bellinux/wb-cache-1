He then tells a joke about his poverty during the gold rush in Australia—his friends having <b>bought</b> <b>scrap</b> meat {{claiming}} it was for dogs. This leads Smith to analyze humor, then genius, and instinct, after which he writes about the labors of writing, including instruction as well as opinion on popular literature.|$|E
50|$|In 1895 {{the nearby}} Grassy Gully mine was discovered. In 1990 all the usable scrap iron {{in the town}} was <b>bought</b> by <b>scrap</b> dealers from Nowra. Further {{dismantling}} of the town occurred during the First World War when building materials {{were used for the}} war effort.|$|R

50|$|The {{estate was}} broken up {{and sold in}} lots. The house was <b>bought</b> by <b>scrap</b> dealers who {{stripped}} what they could from the house, leaving it an empty shell. In 1972 {{the remnants of the}} house and garden (excluding the church) were taken into care by the government, via a compulsory guardianship order.

5000|$|Several Series 5 {{locomotives}} {{were sold}} at auction during 2010. Most were <b>bought</b> by <b>scrap</b> dealers and cut up, but some survived {{to start a}} second career. Nine Class 5E1, Series 5 units were purchased by Rovos Rail, a private operator of luxury rail tours which is based at Capital Park in Pretoria.

5000|$|Due to {{plans of}} Polish {{aviation}} authorities (mainly Ludomił Rayski) to gather all aviation industry in state-owned factories, Plage & Laśkiewicz works {{were forced to}} bankruptcy. After delivering 7 of ordered 50 R-XIIIF aircraft in late 1935, the Polish Ministry of War broke the contract under a pretext. As a result, the factory went bankrupt and then was [...] nationalized under the name LWS (Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów - Lublin Aircraft Works). Then, 18 almost ready R-XIIIF, <b>bought</b> by <b>scrap</b> price, were completed, and the next series of 32 was built.|$|R
50|$|In March 1929, General Motors bought 80% of {{the share}} capital of Adam Opel AG. Since GM feared too much {{competition}} with the top models of its own brands Cadillac and Buick, all 25 previously sold Regent models had to be <b>bought</b> back and <b>scrapped.</b> Due to the scrapping of all Opel 24/110, there is no car preserved.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, whilst being driven/tested on the M1 Motorway, DP215 was {{involved}} in an accident which badly damaged the car (at this time it carried the reg. no 'ENP 246B'). Whilst travelling at about 100 mi/h km/h on the motorway a slower Dormobile wandered out into the outside lane, with the Aston Martin unable to avoid a collision. Both vehicles were severely damaged but all occupants were unhurt. Aston Martin, not wishing to gain publicity over the accident, quickly sold the damaged engine {{and the remains of}} the car. The engine-less car was <b>bought</b> for <b>scrap</b> value, by Malcolm Calvert, from the Isle of Wight, who then began restoring it.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was unwilling}} {{now to talk}} with the townsfolk. He had earned for himself the {{reputation}} of an awful skinflint, of a miser in the matter of living. He mumbled regretfully in the shops, <b>bought</b> inferior <b>scraps</b> of meat after long hesitations; and discouraged all allusions to his costume. It was as the barber had foretold. For all one could tell, he had recovered already from the disease of hope; and only Miss Bessie Carvil knew that he said nothing about his son's return because with him it was no longer [...] "next week," [...] "next month," [...] or even [...] "next year." [...] It was [...] "to-morrow." ...|$|R
50|$|During the Bangladesh Liberation War, a Pakistani ship Al Abbas {{was damaged}} by bombing. Later on, {{the ship was}} {{salvaged}} by a Soviet team who were working at Chittagong port {{at the time and}} the ship was brought to the Faujdarhat seashore.

They were bought alongside manufacturing tools <b>bought</b> cheaply as <b>scrap</b> in the United States.|$|R
25|$|In 1972, MV Mi Amigo was <b>bought</b> for <b>scrap</b> {{at auction}} by enthusiast Gerard van Dam, who {{intended}} {{to use it as}} a free radio museum. O'Rahilly promised financial backing if van Dam could return the ship to broadcasting condition. The ship anchored off the Dutch coastal resort of Scheveningen and was serviced and operated from the Netherlands. That autumn various tests, consisting of continuous music, were made on 259 mtr. The station restarted just before Christmas as Radio 199 but soon became Radio Caroline with a Top 40 format. DJs Chris Cary, broadcasting as Spangles Muldoon (who was also station manager), Roger 'Twiggy' Day, Andy Archer, Paul Alexander, Steve England, Johnny Jason and Peter Chicago (real name Peter Murtha) manned the station.|$|R
50|$|The second {{locomotive}} involved was No. 20, an 0-8-0. This locomotive {{built by}} Lokomotivbau Karl-Marx, Potsdam-Babelsberg in 1951. Four hundred such engines were built {{as part of}} the East German World War II reparations for the Soviet Union. In 1996, No. 20 was <b>bought</b> as <b>scrap</b> metal in Estonia and transferred to Saxony-Anhalt by the Mansfelder Bergwerksbahn association, and since 2000, after an extensive overhaul, operated on the association's narrow gauge railway with the same name. It was visiting the Lößnitzgrundbahn railway {{as part of the}} gala. After the accident, the badly damaged locomotive was taken to the Sächsische Dampfeisenbahngesellschaft (SDG) workshops in Oberwiesenthal for assessment. There were reports that the locomotive was so badly damaged that it might be written off, but it was repaired.|$|R

50|$|The {{park has}} 35 attractions, not {{counting}} games and contests, which are paid separately. As the Mirabilandia uses a rotation system of attractions {{with the other}} two traveling parks, Universal Park and Golden Park, rides vary from season to season (except the coasters). One of the great attractions of the park is the roller coaster Super Tornado Dutch company Vekoma which was <b>bought</b> at <b>scrap</b> value of the Luna Park when the rollercoaster was covered with rust, but the park has reformed and is now in full operation. New for the 2010 season is the Extreme and Move it (only in the country), two toys super radical.

5000|$|Most of {{the other}} {{locomotives}} seen in the film, including chase locomotive #1206, and the locomotive consist used {{in an attempt to}} stop the train, #7375 and #7346, were played by EMD SD40-2s leased from the Wheeling and Lake Erie Railway. #1206 was played by three different SD40-2s: W&LE #6353 and #6534, and a third unit that was <b>bought</b> from <b>scrap</b> and modified for cab shots. Judd Stewart's locomotive consist #7375 and #7346 were played by W&LE #6352 and #6351, which also played two locomotive [...] "extras" [...] (#5624 and #5580), wearing the same grey livery with different running numbers. The excursion train locomotive (#2002) was played by a Southwestern Pennsylvania Railroad Paducah-built EMD GP11 rebuilt from an EMD GP9. Passenger coaches carrying schoolchildren were provided by the Orrville Railroad Heritage Society.|$|R
50|$|Approximately 50 {{machines}} were built before Cessna ended their venture into helicopters. Most {{of the aircraft}} built were <b>bought</b> back and <b>scrapped</b> by Cessna, and the type certificate was revoked, presumably to remove any liability to Cessna for continued operation of any copies they could not retrieve. The Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker, Alabama has a YH-41A Seneca prototype (serial number 56-4244) {{as a part of}} its collection, although it is not currently on display.|$|R

50|$|Candidates {{vehicles}} for preservation are often gifted or purchased from their final operator, or are <b>bought</b> from the <b>scrap</b> yard or specialist dealers. Restoration of vehicles often involves mechanical restoration such as repanelling the bodywork, and the reversion of the vehicle's appearance {{to a particular}} historical period, by repainting into a particular livery and restoring other parts such as grilles or displays. On occasion, buses have been saved for preservation having been used long {{after the end of}} their passenger transport career, and been used in a variety of capacities such as caravans or storage sites, requiring more thorough preservation.|$|R
50|$|Alton Newell {{was born}} to an Oklahoma family of migrant workers in 1913. During his {{childhood}} {{his family moved to}} California where Newell was forced to cease his schooling in the 10th grade in order to help support his family. After working a variety of jobs, Newell found himself in the position of managing a scrap yard. Tasked with scrapping cars by hand, which required one man ten hours of work to complete, Newell sought to find a more efficient method. In 1938, Newell moved to Texas and <b>bought</b> a small <b>scrap</b> yard and constructed a portable metal baler to assist in processing scrap metal.|$|R
5000|$|The mill {{closed in}} 1922, and Cummings had grown ill. The {{railroad}} was {{sold at a}} bankruptcy auction. Each major railroad wanted the line, {{but they were all}} afraid of a bidding war, so they agreed to allow an independent company to win the auction unopposed. Unfortunately for them, that independent company, Assets Realization of New York, had <b>bought</b> it for <b>scrap</b> value. Residents and companies along the line and connecting railroads protested, and brought the case {{all the way to the}} Supreme Court, which ordered that it would not be abandoned. However, Assets Realization disobeyed the court and tore it up anyway in December 1922, leaving the Florida Railroad Commission [...] "no recourse but to declare the Ocklawaha Valley Railroad abandoned".|$|R
50|$|LEV2 {{was built}} {{especially}} for the USA at 15.3 m was a stretched version of LEV1 and sometimes known as R3. Following export around 1981 it was used on an experimental extension of MBTA (Boston) commuter service to Concord, New Hampshire. When that experiment was ended in 1981 the LEV2 was sold to Amtrak for use on the Northeast Corridor, but it was quickly put out of service after an accident at a crossing. It was subsequently sold to the Steamtown Museum in Scranton, Pennsylvania {{for use as a}} shuttle, but was damaged during repair and sold for <b>scrap.</b> It was <b>bought</b> from the <b>scrap</b> dealer by the Durbin & Greenbrier Valley Railroad, a tourist railroad in West Virginia, and later sold to the Connecticut Trolley Museum, where it remains to this day.|$|R
50|$|In 1933, Jerzy Rudlicki {{proposed}} a new design R-XXI, {{for a new}} contest for R-XIII successor, {{but it was not}} accepted (the contest was won by the RWD-14 Czapla). However, some of R-XXI features, like higher and rounded in cross-section fuselage and changed shape of a tail fin, were found in latest R-XIII variants. Single prototype of the R-XIIIE was built in 1934, fitted with a stronger 360 hp engine Gnome-Rhone 7K Titan, but it was not produced. Another variant R-XIIIF introduced new, Polish-designed 340 hp engine Skoda G-1620A Mors-I. It had no Townend ring on cylinders of the radial engine. After one prototype (no. 56.101), a series of 50 R-XIIIF were ordered in 1934. After seven aircraft had been delivered, the Polish aviation authorities refused to buy nearly-completed further 18 aircraft, planning to nationalize all aviation industry in Poland. As a result, Plage i Laśkiewicz factory went bankrupt in late 1935, and it was next nationalized under a name LWS (Lubelska Wytwórnia Samolotów - Lublin Aircraft Works). Then, 18 R-XIIIF, <b>bought</b> by <b>scrap</b> price, were completed, and next series of 32 was built. All R-XIIIF were delivered to the Air Force by 1938. However, only 26 of them were completed with Mors engines (and mostly used for training or staff liaison), while 32 had standard 220 hp Wright engines, lowering their performance to R-XIIID level.|$|R
