5|$|Like most <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> Postelsia {{goes through}} {{alternation}} of generations, {{and is an}} annual species. The diploid sporophyte produces, through meiosis, haploid spores, which drip down through the grooves in the blades onto the substrate, which may be mussels, barnacles, or bare rock. These spores develop, through mitosis, into small, multicellular haploid gametophytes, male and female. The male and female gametophytes create sperm and eggs, respectively. The sperm of the male reaches the female egg and fertilizes, resulting in a diploid zygote, which develops into a new sporophyte.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} life {{was that of the}} {{unicellular}} eukaryotes, prokaryotes and archaea until about 610 million years ago when multicellular organisms began to appear in the oceans in the Ediacaran period. The evolution of multicellularity occurred in multiple independent events, in organisms as diverse as sponges, <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> cyanobacteria, slime moulds and myxobacteria. In January 2016, scientists reported that, about 800 million years ago, a minor genetic change in a single molecule called GK-PID may have allowed organisms to go from a single cell organism to one of many cells.|$|E
5|$|The smooth toadfish {{has strong}} jaws that readily crush {{shellfish}} and crustaceans. It feeds predominantly on benthic (bottom-dwelling) organisms in the substrate {{of the bodies}} of water in which it forages. Its diet includes molluscs such as black mussels, pipis, white sunset shells (Soletellina alba) and oysters (Crassostrea), crustaceans such as semaphore crabs and shrimp, and <b>brown</b> <b>algae.</b> The proportions of crustaceans to molluscs can vary widely depending on the abundance of food items; hence in a 1999 field study, the soldier crab (Mictyris longicarpus) predominated in Cowan Creek while the black mussel did so in nearby Berowra Creek. Field experiments showed it was a consumer of oysters and the gastropod Bembicium auratum, and had {{a major impact on}} their numbers.|$|E

25|$|In populations {{found in}} Benthic ecosystems, amphipods play an {{essential}} role in controlling <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> growth. The mesograzer behaviour of amphipods greatly contributes to the suppression of brown algal dominance in the absence of amphipod predators. Amphipods display a strong preference for <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> in Benthic ecosystems, but due to removal of mesograzers by predators such as fish, <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> is able to dominate these communities over green and red algae species.|$|E

25|$|Multicellularity {{has evolved}} {{independently}} at least 25 times, including in some prokaryotes, like cyanobacteria, myxobacteria, actinomycetes, Magnetoglobus multicellularis or Methanosarcina. However, complex multicellular organisms evolved only in six eukaryotic groups: animals, fungi, <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> red algae, green algae, and plants. It evolved repeatedly for plants (Chloroplastida), {{once or twice}} for animals, once for <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> and perhaps several times for fungi, slime molds, and red algae. Multicellularity may have evolved from colonies of interdependent organisms, from cellularization, or from organisms in symbiotic relationships.|$|E

They are sometimes served on edible seaweed, such as <b>brown</b> <b>algae.</b>|$|E
25|$|Early paleobotanists misidentified a {{wide variety}} of {{structures}} they found on the bedding planes of sedimentary rocks as fucoids (Fucales, a kind of <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> or seaweed). However, even during the earliest decades of the study of ichnology, some fossils were recognized as animal footprints and burrows. Studies in the 1880s by A. G. Nathorst and Joseph F. James comparing 'fucoids' to modern traces made it increasingly clear that most of the specimens identified as fossil fucoids were animal trails and burrows. True fossil fucoids are quite rare.|$|E
25|$|George Clifton (1823–1913) an Australian phycologist is {{mentioned}} in Harvey's Memoirs, as the Superintendent of the Water Police in Perth, West Australia sent algal specimens to Harvey (Blackler, H.1977). In these years {{there were many}} workers in this field: W.G. Farlow, mentioned above, who was appointed in 1879 Professor of Cryptogamic Botany at University of Harvard (U.S.A.) in 1879 and published, among other works, the Marine algae of New England and Adjacent Coasts.; in 1876 John Erhard Areschoug, a Swedish Professor of Botany at Upsalla University, reported on some <b>brown</b> <b>algae</b> collected in California by Gustavus A. Eisen (Papenfuss. 1976). George W.Traill (1836–1897) was a clerk in the Standard Life Company in Edinburgh where he worked long hours, yet {{he was one of}} the greatest authorities on Scottish algae. Despite bad health he was an indefatigable collector. In 1892 he gave his collection to the Herbarium of the Edinburgh Botanic Gardens (Furley, 1989).|$|E

500|$|Postelsia palmaeformis, {{also known}} as the sea palm (not to be {{confused}} with the southern sea palm) or palm seaweed, is a species of kelp and classified within <b>brown</b> <b>algae.</b> [...] The sea palm is found along the western coast of North America, on rocky shores with constant waves. [...] It is one of the few algae that can survive and remain erect out of the water; in fact, it spends most of its life cycle exposed to the air. [...] It is an annual, and edible, though harvesting of the alga is discouraged due to the species' sensitivity to overharvesting.|$|E
500|$|When Italian {{botanist}} Achille Forti (1878–1937) {{worked on}} the specimens in 1926, they were reinterpreted as close relatives of Postelsia, now {{known to be a}} <b>brown</b> <b>algae,</b> which had lived in the coastal waters of the Eocene sea. Forti renamed the species Postelsiopsis caput-medusae commemorating the fossils' extreme similarity to the extant Postelsia palmaeformis. [...] The appearance of the plant fossil is a holdfast on the bottom, with a stem-like stipe between there and the fronds which are about [...] to [...] In life, the fronds would have hung vertically whenever the plant was submerged during high tide, and would have flopped over the stipe when the plant was exposed during low tide in a habitus {{similar to that of the}} living sea palm.|$|E
