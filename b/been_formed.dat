5|$|Building {{blocks of}} DNA (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> extraterrestrially in outer space. Complex DNA and RNA organic {{compounds}} of life, including uracil, cytosine, and thymine, have also <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> {{in the laboratory}} under conditions mimicking those found in outer space, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites. Pyrimidine, like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the most carbon-rich chemical found in the universe, may have <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in red giants or in interstellar cosmic dust and gas clouds.|$|E
5|$|In March 2015, NASA {{scientists}} reported that, for {{the first}} time, complex DNA and RNA organic compounds of life, including uracil, cytosine and thymine, have <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in the laboratory under outer space conditions, using starting chemicals, such as pyrimidine, found in meteorites.

5|$|The {{noble gases}} show {{extremely}} low chemical reactivity; consequently, {{only a few}} hundred noble gas compounds have <b>been</b> <b>formed.</b> Neutral compounds in which helium and neon are involved in chemical bonds have not <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> (although there is some theoretical evidence for a few helium compounds), while xenon, krypton, and argon have shown only minor reactivity. The reactivity follows the order Ne < He < Ar < Kr < Xe < Rn.|$|E

5|$|In theory, radon is more {{reactive}} than xenon, {{and therefore}} should form chemical bonds {{more easily than}} xenon does. However, due to the high radioactivity and short half-life of radon isotopes, only a few fluorides and oxides of radon have <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> in practice.|$|E
50|$|The two northerly islet groups <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> from gabbro, a {{hard-wearing}} rock of igneous origin whilst {{those of}} the Daufraich group to their south (and indeed Llechau-isaf) <b>are</b> <b>formed</b> from microtonalite, another intrusive igneous rock. The most southerly, Emsger <b>is</b> <b>formed</b> from rhyolite. All these are of probable lower Palaeozoic origin. Llechau-uchaf <b>is</b> <b>formed</b> from the late Cambrian 'Lingula Flags' whilst Carreg-trai <b>is</b> <b>formed</b> from Ordovician acid tuffs of the Llanrian Volcanic Formation. The submarine geology between the main groups <b>is</b> <b>formed</b> by sandstones and mudstones of Cambro-Ordovician age, though the bedrock is partly covered by sand and gravel.|$|R

5|$|Allegations {{have been}} made of {{omissions}} in the history described by the film. The absence of discussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict was noticed by some viewers. Davis claimed that Leo Strauss's ideas had <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> by his experiences in Germany during the Weimar Republic, and alleged that the film's failure to mention this was motivated by a wish to portray Strauss as concerned with American suburban culture, like Qutb.|$|E
5|$|As {{the name}} suggests, an {{elliptical}} galaxy has the cross-sectional {{shape of an}} ellipse. The stars move along random orbits with no preferred direction. These galaxies contain little or no interstellar dust, few star-forming regions, and generally older stars. Elliptical galaxies are more commonly found {{at the core of}} galactic clusters, and may have <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> through mergers of large galaxies.|$|E
5|$|At Lulworth Cove, {{the waves}} have cut {{their way through}} the {{resistant}} Portland stone and created a horseshoe-shaped cove by eroding the softer sands and clays behind. Another feature of this part of the coast is Durdle Door, a natural arch.

5|$|At party {{meetings}} in late 1919 and early 1920, hecklers and protesters tried to disrupt Adolf Hitler's speeches, and fought with party members. It {{was decided that}} a permanent group of party members would serve to protect Nazi officials at rallies and disrupt the meetings of opposing parties. The basis for the Sturmabteilung ("Storm Detachment"; SA) had <b>been</b> <b>formed.</b> Heiden became an early member of the Nazi Party and the SA. In 1923, Heiden joined a small personal bodyguard unit for Adolf Hitler named Stoßtrupp-Hitler ("Shock Troop-Hitler").|$|E
5|$|Beta Pictoris {{may have}} <b>been</b> <b>formed</b> near the Scorpius-Centaurus Association. The {{collapse}} of the gas cloud {{which resulted in the}} formation of Beta Pictoris may have been triggered by the shock wave from a supernova explosion: the star which went supernova may have been a former companion of HIP 46950, which is now a runaway star. Tracing the path of HIP 46950 backwards suggests {{that it would have been}} in the vicinity of the Scorpius-Centaurus Association about 13 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|Computer {{models have}} been very {{successful}} at calculating the behavior of TypeII supernovae when the shock has <b>been</b> <b>formed.</b> By ignoring the first second of the explosion, and assuming that an explosion is started, astrophysicists {{have been able to}} make detailed predictions about the elements produced by the supernova and of the expected light curve from the supernova.|$|E
