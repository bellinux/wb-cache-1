The main difficulty is the correction of the relatively large and fast sextupole change during snap-back. Motivated by the above considerations, we have pursued an extended study of sextupole snap-back on two different magnet families, the Tevatron and the LHC <b>bending</b> <b>dipoles,</b> using the same measurement method. We show here {{that it is possible to}} generalise the results obtained by using a simple, exponential scaling law.

This {{transfer line}} is comprised of three major sections; the long central section, consisting of {{a long string of}} periodic FODO cells, is made entirely of permanent magnet dipoles, quadrupoles, and gradient magnets. The motivation for employing permanent magnets wherever possible in the line was primarily to acquire the manufacturing and operating experience necessary to ensure the success of the future Recycler Ring [2]. 1. 1 8 GeV beamline permanent magnets The 8 GeV line uses four types of permanent magnets: a gradient (combined function) dipole [3] used in the normal arc cells, a normal quadrupole [4] used in the reverse bend cells near the beginning of the line, a short dipole used for horizontal bends in the arc cells, and a vertical <b>bend</b> <b>dipole</b> used to pitch the beam down coming out of the Booster.

The basic variable used to classify our results is the bunch spacing tb, whose values are 12. 5, 25, 50 and 75 ns. The ecloud heat load follows an inverse relation to tb both for the LHC and for the injectors, with tb = 12. 5 ns being by far the least favorable case. Although tb = 75 ns is the most favorable case, the 50 -ns option comes closely behind. A simulated comparison of copper vs. stainless steel shows a clear advantage of the former over the latter.

40|$|The {{forthcoming}} {{operation of}} the CERN Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at 13 - 14 TeV requires a deep understanding of the heat transfer mechanisms in the most critical superconducting magnets.

Heat extraction capability of the LHC Nb-Ti magnets relies on the significant contribution provided by superfluid helium (He II). Due to {{lack of knowledge of}} the He II distribution in the cable and in the compressed insulation, experimental investigations are necessary. In this work we present an experimental study aimed at reproducing the thermal behavior of superconducting coils using short length samples.

Under {{study is the}} Future Circular Collider (FCC), which has a {{circumference}} of about 100 km, aiming at a proton–proton collision energy of 100 TeV. Consequently, the main <b>bending</b> <b>dipole</b> magnets have to operate at a magnetic field of 16 T.

Optimizing such complex magnet layouts requires an iterative algorithm, which arranges the positions of the various blocks of coil windings in the coil cross section, thereby finding the thickness of the coil layers. The iterative algorithm is coupled to an adiabatic quench model, which finds an optimal copper-to-superconductor fraction for each of the layers. Outside the iterative cycle, a pattern search algorithm is applied to find a cost optimal distribution of the magnetic field generated by each coil layer...|$|E
40|$|Skew quadrupoles {{are well}} known for their {{capability}} of tilting beams around their longitudinal axes. However, dipoles can produce the same effect. A horizontal <b>bending</b> <b>dipole</b> aligned with an inclination (slope) angle phi {{with respect to the}} reference coordinate system introduces a small tilt (roll) angle psi into the beam, which for small angles is proportional to the product of the magnet bending angle alpha and the slope phi. For transfer lines this effect has previously been neglected (it is comparable to the tilt alignment tolerance of the magnets of the order of 0. 1 mrad rms), but for long lines with many horizontal bending magnets on relatively steep vertical slopes relative to the reference frame, a non-negligible tilt angle psi can accumulate between the local beam plane and the reference alignment system. This can result in mismatch at injection with subsequent emittance blow-up, and other undesirable effects, such as non-orthogonal trajectory measurement and correction. A detailed description of this effect is given, illustrated by the SPS to LHC transfer lines TI 8 and the LHC machine itself. The implications and the resulting choice of methodology for alignment of the elements along the line are described and a solution for matching to the plane of the LHC is outlined...|$|E

The system consists of a Pre-Deflector (PD), a Quadrupole (Q), a Hexapole (H) and a vertically <b>bending</b> <b>dipole</b> Magnet (VM). In the conceptual design of the spectrometer, the proposed iron poles of PD are similar to a �clam-shell� gap to accept large azimuthal scattering angles [1]. However, this system is rather complicated to build and operate in order to keep and scale homogeneous magnetic fields. Besides, the ion-optics calculations show that the solid angle is too small, particularly at angles smaller than 15 � due to the strong edge focusing at the front edge of PD [2]. In order to overcome these difficulties, we propose to change the design of PD to the constant gap [3]. Fig. 1 shows the mid-plane of the constant gap PD. The main coils are wound around the iron-poles. angle acceptances in polar and azimuthal directions are ± 30 mrad and ± 60 mrad, respectively.

The method relies on Fourier analysis of near field speckles generated by scattering from nanoparticles suspended in a liquid. A criterion based on master curves of power spectra is introduced and validated by measurements on the visible light produced by the ALBA <b>bending</b> <b>dipole.</b> While spatial coherence measurements with HNFS have been reported, we present {{for the first time}} measurements of the temporal coherence of SR wavefronts with the HNFS method both for narrowband and white light beams. In the former case, using a band-pass filter, a coherence time of 40 ± 10 [*][*]fs is measured, in good agreement with the expected value of 43  fs for the filter inverse linewidth. Moreover, by exploiting the self-reference scheme of the technique, we show that coherence areas propagate carrying nonvanishing curvature. In the latter case, the measured coherence time of the incident SR without any monochromator is 1. 6 ± 0. 4 [*][*]fs, corresponding to a bandwidth of 240  nm at a peak wavelength of 350  nm.

40|$|As {{pointed out}} by Wiedemann, there are three basic {{periodic}} lattices using usually in storage rings [1, 2]. Among these are the FODO, Chasman-Green lattice and triplet. They have not sextupole and octopole lenses and define so-called linear machines. To facilitate the calculations the consideration is restricted only to systems with quadrupole magnets. The equations of small deviations are derived in linear approximation. It is established that these expressions are specific differential equations with periodic coefficients and small parameter of the highest derivative. The Hill equations with a formula for the angular velocity determine the charged particle dynamics. Given problem for storage rings is the continuation of electron dynamics study in accelerators [3, 4] where the angular properties of synchrotron radiation were considered.

40|$|After LHC will {{be turned}} off, a new, more {{energetic}} machine will be {{needed in order to}} explore unknown regions of the high-energy physics. For this reason, the project Future Circular Collider (FCC) has started, with the goal of developing a 100 km circumference collider of 50 TeV proton beams. The Eurocircol collaboration is part of the FCC study under the European Community leadership, and it aims to develop a conceptual design of FCC within 2019. One of the main targets is to design a <b>bending</b> <b>dipole</b> able to reach 16 T operation magnetic field, in order to accomplish the size and energy constraints. Such a magnetic field can be reached using Nb 3 Sn conductors at their highest performance. One option under exploration is the Cosθ dipole, by INFN of Milano and Genova. One of the aspects to be taken into consideration is the amount of conductor needed, because of the relatively high cost of superconducting cables involving Nb 3 Sn. The amount of superconductor in the cross-section conductor area is a discriminant element for the choice of the magnet lay-out. At the same time enough copper stabilizer must be included in order to limit the Joule dissipation in case of quench. For these reasons, together with the very high stored energy, quench protection {{is one of the most}} challenging aspects of the design.

40|$|The Large Electron Positron {{accelerator}} (LEP) is {{a storage}} ring {{which has been}} operated since 1989 at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics (CERN), located in the Geneva area. It is intended to experimentally verify the Standard Model theory and in particular to detect with high accuracy {{the mass of the}} electro-weak force bosons. Electrons and positrons are accelerated inside the LEP ring in opposite directions and forced to collide at four locations, once they reach an energy high enough for the experimental purposes. During head-to-head collisions the leptons loose all their energy and a huge amount of energy is concentrated in a small region. In this condition the energy is quickly converted in other particles which tend to go away from the interaction point. The higher the energy of the leptons before the collisions, the higher the mass of the particles that can escape. At LEP four large experimental detectors are accommodated. All detectors are multi purpose detectors covering a solid angle of almost 4.. The first period of operation of LEP (1989 - 1995) has been to the scan of the Z boson energy range, and the electrons and positrons beams were accelerated up to about 45 GeVper beam (see section 1. 3. 1). Since the end of 1995 LEP is devoted to operate at higher energies, up to more than 100 GeVper beam in the 1999 - 2000 runs. It was thus possible to investigate the W boson properties and the HiggÂs particle existence, in case its mass reveals to be at this energy level. The types of event (i. e. the fundamental particles) which can be detected depends on the lepton energy before colliding (see Fig. 1. 2). The particle beams energy calibration is thus a focal point for a successful operation of the collider. During normal operation electrons and positrons are bent inside the ideal circular trajectory by mean of a number of dipole magnets. The energy of the leptons depends on the total dipole field along their trajectory. The bending field around LEP is monitored by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) probes which sample the field in twenty locations. Such measurements provide part of the data for the energy calibration model (see chapter 2). In 1999 a spectrometer has been installed in a section of the LEP ring as a new tool for the beam energy determination. The spectrometer layout mainly consist in an iron-core bending magnet and six Beam Position Monitor (BPM) stations. The main subject of this thesis work relates to the design, development and application of a special system which is able to measure with high accuracy the total integral field of the spectrometer <b>bending</b> <b>dipole.</b> The dissertation begins with a short introduction to CERN and its accelerator complex. Further on the LEP collider is described in detail and the basics of the beam energy calibration are included. Chapter 3 describes the LEP spectrometer, starting from the concept and layout, outlining the dipole magnet characteristics. The chapter ends with the presentation of some measurements performed on the LEP injection magnets in order to investigate the possible thermal effects to be foreseen on the spectrometer magnet.

On each side of the interaction regions eight cryogenic elements (six quadrupoles and two horizontal <b>bending</b> <b>dipoles)</b> are placed inside large cryostats. The quadrupole magnetic centers are obtained by antenna measurements with an accuracy of {+-} 60 {micro}m. The signals from the antenna were cross calibrated with the colloidal cell measurements of the same magnet. The positions of the fiducials are related to the magnet centers during the antenna measurements. Elements are positioned warm inside the cryostats, with offsets to account for shrinkage during the cool down. The supports at the middle of the two central quadrupoles are fixed, while every other element slides longitudinally inside the cryostat during cool down or warm up...|$|R
40|$|The goal of nuSTORM is {{to provide}} {{well-defined}} neutrino beams for precise measurements of neutrino cross-sections and oscillations. The nuSTORM decay ring is a compact racetrack storage ring with a circumference of ~ 480 m that incorporates large aperture (60 cm diameter) magnets. There are many challenges in the design. In order to incorporate the Orbit Combination Section (OCS), used for injecting the pion beam into the ring, a dispersion suppressor is needed adjacent to the OCS. Concurrently, {{in order to maximize}} the number of useful muon decays, strong <b>bending</b> <b>dipoles</b> are needed in the arcs to minimize the arc length. These dipoles create strong chromatic effects, which need to be corrected by nonlinear sextupole elements in the ring. In this paper, a FODO racetrack ring design and its optimization using sextupolar fields via both a Genetic Algorithm (GA) and a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|To {{mitigate}} {{electron cloud}} in particle accelerators a carbon coating with low SEY (Secondary Electron Yield) has been developed. In {{the case of}} the SPS (Super Proton Synchrotron), which belongs to the LHC injector chain, testing of the performance of coated beam pipes directly in the accelerator must cope with the schedule of the regular machine operation. For this reason an alternative tool based on RF induced multipacting in a coaxial configuration has been designed for ex-situ characterization of the main <b>bending</b> <b>dipoles</b> of the SPS. In this contribution we report the results obtained before and after coating for two 6. 4 meter dipoles with different cross sections of the vacuum chambers. The multipacting is monitored by measuring the pressure rise and the RF reflected power. After coating, the power threshold to induce multipacting is strongly reduced indicating a lower propensity for electron cloud. The impact of the RF coupling on the sensitivity of the technique is discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{behavior}} of orbits in charged-particle beam transport systems, including both linear and circular accelerators {{as well as}} final focus sections and spectrometers, can depend sensitively on nonlinear fringe-field and high-order-multipole effects in the various beam-line elements. The inclusion of these effects requires a detailed and realistic model of the interior and fringe fields, including their high spatial derivatives. A collection of surface fitting methods has been developed for extracting this information accurately from 3 -dimensional field data on a grid, as provided by various 3 -dimensional finite-element field codes. Based on these realistic field models, Lie or other methods {{may be used to}} compute accurate design orbits and accurate transfer maps about these orbits. Part I of this work presents a treatment of straight-axis magnetic elements, while Part II will treat <b>bending</b> <b>dipoles</b> with large sagitta. An exactly-soluble but numerically challenging model field is used to provide a rigorous collection of performance benchmarks. Comment: Accepted to PRST-AB.
