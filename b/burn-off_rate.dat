If the arc length decreases, arc voltage will increase, arc current and therefore <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate</b> will increase thereby causing the arc to lengthen.

40|$|This paper explores how to fit {{the decay}} of the {{luminosity}} in the Tevatron. The standard assumptions of a fixed-lifetime exponential decay are only appropriate for very short time intervals. A " 1 /time " functional form fits well, and is supported by analytical derivations. A more complex form, assuming a time-varying lifetime-like term, also produces good results. Changes in the luminosity can be factored into two phenomena: The luminosity <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate,</b> and the <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate</b> from non-luminosity effects. This is particularly relevant for the antiprotons in the Tevatron. The luminous and the non-luminous burn rate of the antiprotons are shown for Tevatron stores...|$|E
40|$|Numerical models used to {{simulate}} LFW {{rely on the}} modelling of the oscillations to generate heat. As a consequence, simulations are time consuming, making analysis of 3 D geometries difficult. To address this, a model was developed of a Ti- 6 Al– 4 V LFW that applied the weld heat at the interface and ignored the material deformation and expulsion which was captured by sequentially removing row of elements. The model captured the experimental trends and showed that the maximum interface temperature was achieved when a <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate</b> of between 2 and 3 mm/s occurred. Moreover, the models showed that the interface temperature is reduced when a weld is produced with a higher pressure and when the workpieces are oscillated along the shorter of the two interface dimensions. This modelling approach provides a computationally efficient foundation for subsequent residual stress modelling, which is of interest to end users of the process...|$|E

The world supply from mining, depletion of the remaining reserves, reducing ore grades, market price and turnover of silver was simulated using the SILVER model developed for this study. The model combines mining, trade markets, price mechanisms, populations dynamics, use in society and waste and recycling into an integrated system. At {{the same time the}} degree of sustainability and resource time horizon was estimated using different methods such as: 1 : <b>burn-off</b> <b>rates,</b> 2 : peak discovery early warning, 3 : Hubbert's production model, and 4 : System dynamic modelling. The Hubbert's model was run for the period of 6000 BC– 3000 AD, the SILVER system dynamics model was run for the time range 1840 – 2340. We have estimated that the ultimately recoverable reserves of silver are in the range 2. 7 – 3. 1 million tonne silver at present, of which approximately 1. 35 – 1. 46 million tonne have already been mined. The timing estimate range for peak silver production is narrow, in the range 2027 – 2038, with the best estimate in 2034. By 2240, all silver mines will be nearly empty and exhausted. The outputs from all models converge to emphasize the importance of consistent recycling and the avoidance of irreversible losses to make society more sustainable with respect to silver market supply...|$|R

40|$|A {{computational}} {{fluid dynamics}} (CFD) based process model of a rotary furnace for aluminium scrap melting was developed and integrated with user-developed sub-models. The model consists of a gas region with turbulent flow and combustion, radiative heat transfer in {{the upper part of}} the furnace, a solid region of the furnace lining, and a solid-liquid region of salt and metal in the lower part of the furnace. The solid-liquid region, where scrap melting and burn-off reactions take place, was regarded as a conducting solid. Scrap phase change (melting) and scrap burn-off was simulated by the user-developed sub-models. A descritized population balance model (PBM) for aluminium scrap was established to represent the distributed nature of the scrap feed. The melting behaviour of aluminium scrap was simulated with the exchange of information between the melting sub-model and the CFD calculations. Simulations of the melting process were made to model the flow and thermal phenomena in such a furnace. Case studies, such as the influence of the scrap size, shape and quality, as well as <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate,</b> were carried out...|$|E
40|$|International audienceZirconium alloys are {{typically}} used in nuclear pressurized water reactors (PWR) as fuel cladding tubes {{due to their}} chemical stability and their mechanical strength at operating temperatures (approximate to 300 degrees C). However, the corrosion of Zr-based cladding tubes {{is one of the}} factors limiting the <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate</b> in PWRs. It is commonly accepted that the corrosion kinetics involves a periodic succession of growth where the oxide thickness varies parabolically with time. As the oxide thickens, a cracking structure forms. The oxide appears striated with periodic layers of cracks running parallel to the metal/oxide interface. This cracking structure has been experimentally related to the periodicity of the oxide growth. In the present work, a finite-element study is used to investigate the development of stresses in the oxide under the combined influence of molar volume expansion during oxide formation, metal/oxide interface geometry and metallic substrate creep. The generation of tensile stresses capable of initiating the cracks that are observed experimentally is explored. (C) 2013 Acta Materialia Inc. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserve...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the high intensity lead beams in the LHC are strongly influenced by intra-beam scattering (IBS), leading to significant emittance growth and particle losses at all energies. Particle losses during collisions are dominated by nuclear electromagnetic processes and the debunching effect arising from the influence of IBS, resulting in a non-exponential intensity decay during the fill and short luminosity lifetimes. In the LHC heavy ion runs, 3 experiments will be taking data and the average fill duration will be rather short {{as a consequence of}} the high <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate.</b> The achievements with stochastic cooling at RHIC suggest that such a system at LHC could substantially reduce the emittance growth and the debunching component during injection and collisions. The luminosity lifetime and fill length could be improved to optimize the use of the limited run time of 4 weeks per year. This paper discusses the first results of a feasibility study to use stochastic cooling on the lead ion beams in the LHC. The present and expected future performance without cooling is presented and compared to preliminary simulations estimating the improvements if stochastic cooling is applied...|$|E
40|$|High {{performance}} aircraft typically use {{hydrocarbon fuel}} to regeneratively cool the airframe and engine components. As the coolant temperatures increase, the fuel may react with dissolved oxygen forming deposits that limit the regenerative cooling system performance. This study investigates the deposition of Jet A using a thermal stability experiment and {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) modeling. The experimental portion {{of this study is}} performed with a high Reynolds number thermal stability (HiRets) tester in which fuel passes though an electrically heated tube and the fuel outlet temperature is held constant. If the thermal stability temperature of the fuel is exceeded, deposits form and adhere {{to the inside of the}} tube creating an insulating layer between the tube and the fuel. The HiRets tester measures the tube outer wall temperatures near the fuel outlet to report the effect of deposition occurring inside the tube. Final deposits are also estimated with a carbon burn off analysis. The CFD model was developed and used to simulate the fluid dynamics, heat transfer, chemistry, and transport of the deposit precursors. The model is calibrated to the experiment temperature results and carbon burn-off deposition results. The model results show that the dominant factor in deposition is the heated wall temperature and that most of the deposits are formed in the laminar sublayer. The models predicted a 7. 0 E- 6 kilograms per square meter-sec deposition rate, which compared well to the carbon <b>burn-off</b> analysis deposition <b>rate</b> of 1. 0 E- 6 kilograms per square meter-sec...|$|R
40|$|Linear {{friction}} welding (LFW) is a solid-state joining {{process that is}} finding increasing interest from industry for the fabrication of titanium alloy (Ti– 6 Al– 4 V) preforms. Currently, {{the effects of the}} workpiece geometry on the thermal fields, material flow and interface contaminant removal during processing are not fully understood. To address this problem, two-dimensional (2 D) computational models were developed using the finite element analysis (FEA) software DEFORM and validated with experiments. A key finding was that the width of the workpieces in the direction of oscillation (in-plane width) had a much greater effect on the experimental weld outputs than the cross-sectional area. According to the validated models, a decrease of the in-plane width increased the <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate</b> whilst decreasing the interface temperature, TMAZ thickness and the burn-off required to remove the interface contaminants from the weld into the flash. Furthermore, the experimental weld interface consisted of a Widmanstätten microstructure, which became finer as the in-plane width was reduced. These findings have significant, practical benefits and may aid industrialisation of the LFW process.

40|$|Particle {{size and}} oxygen content {{are two of}} the key factors that affect the {{ignition}} and combustion properties of aluminum particles. In this study, a laser ignition experimental system and flame test system were built to analyze the ignition and combustion characteristics and the flame morphology of aluminum particles. A thermobalance system was used to analyze the thermal oxidation characteristics. In addition, the microstructure of aluminum was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that the oxidized products were some of the gas phase products agglomerated. Smaller particle size samples showed better combustion characteristics. The combustion intensity, self-sustaining combustion time and the <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate</b> showed a rising trend with the decrease in the particle size. Increasing the oxygen content in the atmosphere could improve the ignition and combustion characteristics of the samples. Four distinct stages were observed in the process of ignition and combustion. Small particle size samples had a larger flame height and luminance, and the self-sustaining combustion time was much longer. Three distinct stages were observed during the thermal oxidation process. The degree of oxidation for small-sized samples was significantly higher than that for the larger particle size samples. Moreover, it was observed that the higher the oxygen content, the higher the degree of oxidation was. Keywords: Aluminum, Flame, Ignition and combustion, Laser, Thermal analysi...|$|E
40|$|While hand {{grinding}} can be tolerated in some circumstances, producing welds for safety-critical applications and where weld properties must meet stringent inspection criteria needs a more con-trolled approach. Following {{are some tips}} for optimizing electrode preparation, {{which can lead to}} a significant increase in electrode life. 1. Choose the right diameter. Table 1 can be used to determine the electrode diameter best suited to the welding current you are using. This guide to the optimum diameter is based on decades of welding practice. 2. Choose a reputable supplier. Superficially, electrodes from differ-ent companies look much the same, but do consider that, in general, cost means quality. The better electrodes have been manufactured to ensure a small grain structure that allows for better migration of oxides to the tip, easier arc starting, improved arc time, and better weld quali-ty with minimized contamination. 3. Choose the best electrode compo-sition. For many years, manufacturers have been adding residual compounds to offer improved performance. Additions of sta-ble oxides such as thoria, ceria, and lan-thana provide the same level of emission as pure tungsten at lower temperatures, while improving arc time and stability. Pure tungsten has a high work func-tion, i. e., it takes a great deal of energy to operate. This makes it difficult to start and maintain a stable arc. It also has a high <b>burn-off</b> <b>rate</b> and thus a shorter serv-ice life. Thoria stablized. It is now clear that thoria, although promoting better weld-ing, is low-level radioactive and many manufacturers and welders have stopped using it because of the health concerns (Refs. 1, 2). Zirconia stabilized. Zirconia is used for radiographic-quality welding where tungsten contamination must be mini-mized. It balls up easily in AC applica...|$|E
