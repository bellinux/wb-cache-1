Franklin looking towards the Presidents Chair, {{at the back}} of which a rising sun {{happened}} to be painted, observed to a few members near him, that Painters had found it difficult to distinguish in their art a rising from a setting sun.

5|$|When {{given the}} {{opportunity}} to host a public reception for President McKinley, fair organizers chose to site it in the Temple of Music—Louis L. Babcock, grand marshal of the Exposition, regarded the building as ideal for the purpose. The large auditorium was located close to the Esplanade, {{in the heart of the}} fair, and had doorways on each of its four sides. In addition to rows of chairs on the floor of the hall, it had spacious galleries. Babcock spent the morning of September 6 making some physical arrangements for the reception. Floor seating was removed to create a broad aisle, running from the east doors through which the public would be admitted, to where McKinley would stand. Once members of the public shook hands with McKinley, they would continue on to exit the building. An American flag was draped <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> both to screen him from behind and for decoration—several potted plants were arrayed around his place to create an attractive scene. Besides its utility for other purposes, the ornate building was one of the architectural features of the fair.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{accountability}} to MEPs or national parliamentarians has also cast {{doubt as to}} whether national leaders will in practice stand <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> on major issues. Under the rotational system, the presidents simply had the mandate of their member states, while the new permanent president is chosen {{by the members of}} the European Council.|$|E

25|$|A {{few minutes}} after 2:00p.m. CST (20:00 UTC), Kennedy's remains were taken from Parkland Hospital to Love Field. His casket was then loaded onto Air Force One through the rear door, where it {{remained}} {{at the rear of}} the passenger compartment in place of a removed row of seats. Johnson had accompanied Kennedy to Dallas and was riding two cars <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> in the motorcade. The new President refused to leave for Washington without the remains of Kennedy and his widow Jacqueline.|$|E

2500|$|Mondale {{had wanted}} to choose New York Governor Mario Cuomo {{as his running mate}}, but Cuomo {{declined}} and recommended Ferraro, his protégée. The nominee would likely have named Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis as his running mate had he made a [...] "safe" [...] choice". Others preferred Senator Lloyd Bentsen because he would appeal to more conservative Southern voters. Nomination rival Gary Hart stated before Ferraro's selection that he would accept an invitation to run with Mondale; Hart's supporters claimed he would do better than Mondale against President Reagan, an argument undercut by a June 1984 Gallup poll that showed both men nine points <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>president.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On November 22, 1963, the Johnsons were {{accompanying}} the Kennedys in Dallas when President Kennedy was assassinated; {{they were two}} cars <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> in his motorcade. Lady Bird later said the day was unforgettable. Lyndon {{was sworn in as}} President on Air Force One two hours after Kennedy died, with Lady Bird and Jacqueline Kennedy by his side. Afterward, Lady Bird created a tape on which she recorded her memories of the assassination, saying it was [...] "primarily as a form of therapy to help me over the shock and horror of the experience." [...] She submitted a transcript of the tape to the Warren Commission as testimony. LBJ advisor Abe Fortas had made notations on her document to add detail. In their plans for their trip to Texas, the Johnsons had intended to entertain the Kennedys that night at their ranch.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the time}} the final {{primaries}} concluded, Mondale had a considerable lead in total delegates, though he was 40 delegates short of clinching victory. Superdelegates voted overwhelmingly for Mondale at the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco on July 16, making him the presidential nominee. Hart, already aware that the nomination was all but Mondale's after the final primaries, lobbied for the vice presidential slot on the ticket, claiming {{that he would do}} better than Mondale against President Ronald Reagan (an argument undercut by a June 1984 Gallup poll that showed both men nine points <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>president).</b> While Hart was given serious consideration, Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro instead. [...] In his address to the convention, after his name was placed in nomination for president by Nebraska governor Bob Kerrey and he received a 15-minute standing ovation, Hart concluded, “Our party and our country will continue to hear from us. This is one Hart you will not leave in San Francisco.” ...|$|E

60|$|It is {{four o'clock}} in the afternoon, and we may go to see our lottery drawn. The {{ceremony}} takes place every Saturday, in the Tribunale, or Court of Justice--this singular, earthy-smelling room, or gallery, as mouldy as an old cellar, and as damp as a dungeon. At the upper end is a platform, with a large horse-shoe table upon it; and a President and Council sitting round--all judges of the Law. The man on the little stool <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>President,</b> is the Capo Lazzarone, a kind of tribune of the people, appointed on their behalf to see that all is fairly conducted: attended by a few personal friends. A ragged, swarthy fellow he is: with long matted hair hanging down all over his face: and covered, from head to foot, with most unquestionably genuine dirt. All {{the body of the}} room is filled with the commonest of the Neapolitan people: and between them and the platform, guarding the steps leading to the latter, is a small body of soldiers.|$|E
60|$|In {{the present}} crowded {{state of the}} world a policy of Thibet may be carried out in some obscure corner, but it cannot be done in a great tract of country which lies right across the main line of {{industrial}} progress. The position is too absolutely artificial. A handful of people by the right of conquest take possession of an enormous country over which they are dotted at such intervals that it is their boast that one farmhouse cannot see the smoke of another, and yet, though their numbers are so disproportionate to the area which they cover, they refuse to admit any other people upon equal terms, but claim to be a privileged class who shall dominate the new-comers completely. They are outnumbered in their own land by immigrants who are far more highly educated and progressive, and yet they hold them down in a way which exists nowhere else upon earth. What is their right? The right of conquest. Then the same right may be justly invoked to reverse so intolerable a situation. This they would themselves acknowledge. 'Come on and fight! Come on!' cried a member of the Volksraad when the franchise petition of the Uitlanders was presented. 'Protest! Protest! What is the good of protesting?' said Kruger to Mr. W. Y. Campbell; 'you have not got the guns, I have.' There was always the final court of appeal. Judge Creusot and Judge Mauser were always <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> <b>President.</b>|$|E
