5|$|Palmer {{publishes a}} study which finds no <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> human stomach. He concludes earlier discoveries were {{a result of}} contamination. Unfortunately, he chooses not to use a silver {{staining}} method, which will be later used to reveal H. pylori by Warren and Marshall.|$|E
5|$|Some {{angler fish}} {{of the deep}} sea, where it is too dark to hunt by sight, contain {{symbiotic}} <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 'bait' on their 'fishing rods'. These emit light to attract prey.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory is particularly relevant in medicine, where the correct treatment {{is determined by}} the bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major impetus for the development of techniques to identify bacteria.|$|E
50|$|Helicobacter hepaticus is a <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Helicobacteraceae family, Campylobacterales order.|$|R

25|$|At {{least one}} species of <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Nocardia can degrade PET with an {{esterase}} enzyme.|$|R
5|$|The {{presence}} of <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach may be beneficial, reducing {{the prevalence of}} asthma, rhinitis, dermatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, gastroesophageal reflux disease, and esophageal cancer by influencing systemic immune responses.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} the most {{frequent}} bacterial infection in women. They occur most frequently {{between the ages of}} 16 and 35years, with 10% of women getting an infection yearly and more than 40–60% having an infection {{at some point in their}} lives. Recurrences are common, with nearly half of people getting a second infection within a year. Urinary tract infections occur four times more frequently in females than males. Pyelonephritis occurs between 20–30 times less frequently. They {{are the most}} common cause of hospital acquired infections accounting for approximately 40%. Rates of asymptomatic <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urine increase with age from two to seven percent in women of child bearing age to as high as 50% in elderly women in care homes. Rates of asymptomatic <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urine among men over 75 are between 7-10%. Asymptomatic <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urine occurs in 2% to 10% of pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Yao Shi observes <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stomach, but he {{believes}} they are passing through the stomach and not colonizing it.|$|E
50|$|Moraxella lincolnii is a Gram-negative <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Moraxella, {{which was}} {{isolated}} from the human respiratory tract.|$|R
50|$|Listonella anguillarum is a Gram-negative marine <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Vibrionaceae. The correct name {{nowadays}} is Vibrio anguillarum.|$|R

5|$|Several species {{sometimes}} {{suffer from}} a wasting condition caused by <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Vibrio; however, a more widespread wasting disease, causing mass mortalities among starfish, appears sporadically. A paper published in November 2014 revealed the most likely cause of this disease to be a densovirus the authors named sea star-associated densovirus (SSaDV).|$|E
5|$|Urinary {{catheterization}} {{increases the}} risk for urinary tract infections. The risk of bacteriuria (<b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> urine) is between three and six percent per day and prophylactic antibiotics are not effective in decreasing symptomatic infections. The risk of an associated infection can be decreased by catheterizing only when necessary, using aseptic technique for insertion, and maintaining unobstructed closed drainage of the catheter.|$|E
5|$|A common {{claim of}} creationists is that {{evolution}} {{has never been}} observed. Challenges to such objections often come down to debates over how evolution is defined (see the Defining evolution section above). Under the conventional biological definition of evolution, {{it is a simple}} matter to observe evolution occurring. Evolutionary processes, in the form of populations changing their genetic composition from generation to generation, have been observed in different scientific contexts, including the evolution of fruit flies, mice, and <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> laboratory, and of tilapia in the field. Such studies on experimental evolution, particularly those using microorganisms, are now providing important insights into how evolution occurs, {{especially in the case of}} antibiotic resistance.|$|E
50|$|Moraxella caviae is a Gram-negative <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Moraxella, {{which was}} {{isolated}} from the pharyngeal region and mouth of guinea pig.|$|R
50|$|Moraxella saccharolytica is a Gram-negative <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Moraxella, {{which was}} {{isolated}} from the spinal cord {{of a child with}} meningitis.|$|R
50|$|Helicobacter canadensis is a <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Helicobacteraceae family, Campylobacterales order, first {{isolated}} from humans with diarrhea. Its genome has been sequenced.|$|R
5|$|Cobalt is {{essential}} to the metabolism of all animals. It is a key constituent of cobalamin, also known as vitamin B, the primary biological reservoir of cobalt as an ultratrace element. <b>Bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guts of ruminant animals convert cobalt salts into vitamin B, a compound which can only be produced by bacteria or archaea. The minimum presence of cobalt in soils therefore markedly improves the health of grazing animals, and an uptake of 0.20mg/kg a day is recommended because they have no other source of vitamin B.|$|E
5|$|Controlled {{fermentation}} with microbes in brewing, wine making, baking, pickling and cultured {{dairy products}} such as yogurt and cheese, is used to modify ingredients to make foods with desirable properties. The principal microbes involved are yeasts, {{in the case of}} beer, wine, and ordinary bread; and <b>bacteria,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of anaerobically fermented vegetables, dairy products, and sourdough bread. The cultures variously provide flavour and aroma, inhibit pathogens, increase digestibility and palatability, make bread rise, reduce cooking time, and create useful products including alcohol, organic acids, vitamins, amino acids, and carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|Culture {{techniques}} {{are designed to}} promote the growth and identify particular bacteria, while restricting {{the growth of the}} other <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sample. Often these {{techniques are}} designed for specific specimens; for example, a sputum sample will be treated to identify organisms that cause pneumonia, while stool specimens are cultured on selective media to identify organisms that cause diarrhoea, while preventing growth of non-pathogenic bacteria. Specimens that are normally sterile, such as blood, urine or spinal fluid, are cultured under conditions designed to grow all possible organisms. Once a pathogenic organism has been isolated, it can be further characterised by its morphology, growth patterns (such as aerobic or anaerobic growth), patterns of hemolysis, and staining.|$|E
50|$|Legionella bozemanae is a Gram-negative <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> family Legionellaceae. Its type strain is WIGA (=ATCC 33217). It is {{associated}} with human pneumonia.|$|R
50|$|Tolumonas osonensis is a Gram-negative, {{rod-shaped}} <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Tolumonas. It {{has been}} studied as a biological producer of ethanol and lactate.|$|R
50|$|Moraxella caprae is a Gram-negative, aerobic, nonmotile <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Moraxella, {{which was}} {{isolated}} from the nasal flora of goats in Lyon in France.|$|R
5|$|Edwin Klebs was {{the first}} to observe <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> airways of persons having died of {{pneumonia}} in 1875. Initial work identifying the two common bacterial causes, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Klebsiella pneumoniae, was performed by Carl Friedländer and Albert Fraenkel in 1882 and 1884, respectively. Friedländer's initial work introduced the Gram stain, a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria. Christian Gram's paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to differentiate the two bacteria, and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one microorganism.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, Groundwork Hudson Valley, the {{coordinator}} of the Saw Mill River Coalition, received a three-year, $889,183 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Targeted Watershed Grant. One of 15 recipients from a nationwide pool of more than 100 applicants, the group cleans up garbage, removes invasive species, and plants native trees along the river. The group also marks storm drains that drain to the river. On September 25–26, 2009, the Saw Mill River Coalition organized a BioBlitz to catalog species of plant life, animal life, insects, fungi, and <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> river and its watershed. The Coalition is also looking to restore the wetlands along the river {{in order to reduce}} flooding.|$|E
5|$|Isopods are detritivores, browsers, {{carnivores}} (including {{predators and}} scavengers), parasites, and filter feeders, and may occupy {{one or more}} of these feeding niches. Only aquatic and marine species are known to be parasites or filter feeders. Some exhibit coprophagia and will also consume their own fecal pellets. Terrestrial species are in general herbivorous, with woodlice feeding on moss, bark, algae, fungi and decaying material. In marine isopods that feed on wood, cellulose is digested by enzymes secreted in the caeca. Limnoria lignorum, for example, bores into wood and additionally feeds on the mycelia of fungi attacking the timber, thus increasing the nitrogen in its diet. Land-based wood-borers mostly house symbiotic <b>bacteria</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hindgut which aid in digesting cellulose. There are numerous adaptations to this simple gut, but these are mostly correlated with diet rather than by taxonomic group.|$|E
50|$|Moraxella nonliquefaciens is a Gram-negative <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Moraxella, {{which was}} {{isolated}} from the upper respiratory tract of humans. M. nonliquefaciens occasionally causes disease.|$|R
50|$|Moraxella pluranimalium is a Gram-negative, aerobic, catalase- and oxidase-positive, nonspore-forming <b>bacterium</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> genus Moraxella, {{which was}} {{isolated}} from the nasal turbinate of an pig.|$|R
