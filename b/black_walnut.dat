5|$|Oregon's House {{chamber floor}} {{is covered with}} a custom carpet; the carpet's pattern {{incorporates}} a depiction of the state tree, Douglas-fir, representative of forestry. The furniture and paneling of the chamber is made of golden oak. A large mural painted by Faulkner, depicting the 1843 Champoeg Meetings at which the provisional government was formed, is behind the desk of the Speaker of the House. The Senate chambers use <b>black</b> <b>walnut</b> for the paneling and furniture. Another custom carpet lines the floor, featuring Chinook salmon and wheat, representative of fishing and agriculture. The Senate's large mural was painted by Schwarz and depicts a street scene showing news of statehood reaching Salem. Lining the walls of both chambers are 158 names, inscribed in friezes, of prominent people in Oregon's history. On {{the second floor of the}} capitol is the Governor's suite, consisting of a ceremonial office and private offices for the state's chief executive. As in the Senate chamber, the paneling is of <b>black</b> <b>walnut.</b> The ceremonial office includes a fireplace with a painting by Faulkner. In the suite's reception area is a table made of 40 tree species. This table is inlaid with a replica of Oregon's second capitol building, the state flower (Oregon-grape), and the state bird (western meadowlark).|$|E

5|$|Much of the {{existing}} landscaping {{on the south lawn}} was carried out by Bishop George Henry Law in the 1820s. This included the incorporation of the remains of the roofless great hall and the construction of a raised rampart around the inside of the wall accessible from one of the towers. Bishop Law also created a grotto which he used to display fossils from Banwell Caves which were also part of his estate. A range of tress and shrubs were planted including: a <b>black</b> <b>walnut,</b> Lebanon cedar, catalpa and ginkgo. In the 1830s, Bishop Law had a pool created next to the springs. This acts as a mirror on a still day providing reflections of the east end of the cathedral in the water.|$|E

25|$|Indiana bats {{were found}} {{in a variety of}} plant {{associations}} in a southern Iowa study. Riparian areas were dominated by eastern cottonwood, hackberry (Celtis occidentalis), and silver maple (Acer saccharinum). In the forested floodplains, the dominant plants included <b>black</b> <b>walnut</b> (Juglans nigra), silver maple, American elm (Ulmus americana), and eastern cottonwood. In undisturbed upland forest, the most common plants were black oak (Quercus velutina), bur oak (Q. macrocarpa), shagbark hickory (Carya ovata), and bitternut hickory (C. cordiformis). <b>Black</b> <b>walnut,</b> American basswood, American elm, and bur oak dominated other upland Indiana bat sites.|$|E
40|$|<b>Black</b> <b>walnuts</b> (Juglans nigra L.) {{are valued}} for their uniquely fruity flavor {{and are often}} used as an {{ingredient}} in baked goods and ice cream or are eaten as a snack food. Although <b>black</b> <b>walnuts</b> can be harvested from wild trees, several cultivars have been selected for such characteristics as ease of cracking, size of kernel and thickness of husks and shells. Other characteristics, such as date of budbreak, time of flowering, length of season and date of harvest, are also important as there is considerable variation within the species...|$|R
25|$|Juglans sect. Rhysocaryon (<b>black</b> <b>walnuts)</b> Leaves {{are large}} (20–50cm), with 11–23 slender leaflets, finely pubescent, margins serrated. The wood can be {{extremely}} hard (Brazilian walnut Janka hardness test of 3684). Native to North America and South America.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{the larger}} Fred Russ Forest and Park are noted for their <b>black</b> <b>walnuts</b> and tulip trees. One of the tulip trees has been {{identified}} as the largest tree of this type in Michigan, and is claimed to be 180 ft tall.|$|R
25|$|In North America, {{forestry}} {{research has been}} undertaken mostly on J.nigra, aiming {{to improve the quality}} of planting stock and markets. In some areas of the US, <b>black</b> <b>walnut</b> is the most valuable commercial timber species. The Walnut Council is the key body linking growers with scientists. In Europe, various EU-led scientific programs have studied walnut growing for timber.|$|E
25|$|Valley oak tolerates cool wet winters and hot dry summers, but {{requires}} abundant water. It is {{most abundant}} in rich deep soils of valley floors below 600 meters (2000 feet) in elevation. Valley oak {{is found in}} dense riparian forests, open foothill woodlands and valley savannas. Commonly associated trees are coast live oak, interior live oak, blue oak, <b>black</b> <b>walnut,</b> California sycamore and gray pine.|$|E
25|$|Of the {{documented}} species, some of {{the most}} ecologically and economically interesting are bigleaf mahogany, mountain pine, <b>black</b> <b>walnut</b> (no relation to the eastern North American tree of the same name), limachu, q'illu q'illu (Berberis bumaelifolia, also spelled khellu khellu), cebillo, bibosi, ambaiba, pacay, and clavo rojo. In the cloud-enveloped forests there are extensive patches of giant tree ferns. In addition, there are pachiuva, açaí palms and many species of endemic orchids.|$|E
50|$|Some {{authorities}} (e.g. the California Native Plant Society) combine {{this species}} with J. hindsii.

25|$|In {{the eastern}} US, the gypsy moth prefers oaks, aspen, apple, sweetgum, {{speckled}} alder, basswood, gray birch, paper birch, poplar, willow, and hawthorns, among other species. Older larvae feed on {{several species of}} softwood that younger larvae avoid, including cottonwood, hemlock, Atlantic white cypress, and pine and spruce species native to the east. The gypsy moth avoids ash trees, tulip-tree, American sycamore, butternut, <b>black</b> <b>walnut,</b> catalpa, flowering dogwood, balsam fir, cedar, American holly, and mountain laurel and rhododendron shrubs, but will feed on these in late instars when densities are extremely high.|$|E
25|$|Early {{settlers}} {{relied on}} hunting, fishing, and trapping, and foraging {{to supplement their}} diets and incomes. Today hunting and fishing for recreation are common activities and {{an important part of}} the tourist industry. Foraging for mushrooms (especially morels) and for ginseng is common and financially supported by established buyers in the area. Other forages include poke, watercress, persimmons and pawpaw; wild berries such as blackberry, black raspberry, raspberry, red mulberry, black cherry, wild strawberry and dewberry; and wild nuts such as <b>black</b> <b>walnut</b> and even acorns. Edible native legumes, wild grasses and wildflowers are plentiful, and beekeeping is common.|$|E
25|$|The Cosumnes River is {{the last}} {{remaining}} free-flowing river in California's Central Valley, with the preserve located on the river's lower reach where it joins the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta tidelands. The area supports a diverse range {{of plant and animal}} life, including three species of oak as well as rare plants like the endemic northern California <b>black</b> <b>walnut</b> (Juglans californica var. hindsii). Notable features include the sandhill crane fall migration and the Tall Forest in Wood Duck Slough. More than 250 bird species, more than 40 fish species, and some 230 plant species have been identified here.|$|E
50|$|Once {{the corn}} ran out, they subsisted on <b>black</b> <b>walnuts,</b> wild grapes, pawpaws, Sassafras leaves, {{blackberries}} and frogs but, {{as the weather}} grew cold, {{they were forced to}} eat dead animals that they found along the way. On several occasions they saw Indians hunting, and each time managed to avoid being seen.|$|R
50|$|In Illinois, eastern fox {{squirrels}} {{rely heavily}} on hickories from late August through September. Pecans, <b>black</b> <b>walnuts</b> (Juglans nigra), osage orange (Maclura pomifera) fruits, and corn are also important fall foods. In early spring, elm buds and seeds {{are the most important}} food. In May and June, mulberries (Morus spp.) are heavily used. By early summer, corn in the milk stage becomes a primary food.|$|R

25|$|The first {{settlers}} {{in what would}} be Newburgh Township were David Bryant and his son, Whitman, who arrived in June 1797. East of the Portage Escarpment, they found dense forests of American sycamore, beech, <b>black</b> <b>walnut,</b> eastern hemlock, eastern redcedar, northern red oak, Ohio buckeye, shagbark hickory, sugar maple, and white oak. West of the escarpment were American elm, ash, beech, and black cherry. In some places, settlers would have seen artificial meadows, created by Native Americans using controlled fire. On the flats which formed {{the valley of the}} Cuyahoga River bluegrass, white clover, and wild rye grew in profusion. American bison, eastern elk, and the extremely plentiful white-tailed deer were the most common game animals inhabiting the area. Canada geese, ducks, grouse, passenger pigeon, quail, and wild turkey were the most common game fowl.|$|E

50|$|According to {{the book}} All American Desserts, the {{predecessor}} for Ozark pudding, gateau aux noisettes (cake with hazelnuts), {{was brought to the}} New World by the French Huguenots who settled in Charleston, South Carolina. Because hazelnuts were not common in the US, pecans were used, and it {{came to be known as}} Huguenot torte. By the time the recipe reached the Ozarks and acquired its current name, <b>black</b> <b>walnuts</b> were a common alternative to pecans.|$|R
50|$|The farm {{is located}} {{on the north side of}} the road, just east of where Mix Road intersects from the south. The house and other {{structures}} are located near the front of the 29 acre property; seven acres (7 acre) in the rear are currently under cultivation. Trees planted in the last two decades, including 15 disease-resistant American elms, mark the property lines, along with some mature <b>black</b> <b>walnuts</b> and sugar maples.|$|R

500|$|<b>Black</b> <b>walnut</b> (Juglans nigra) {{is used by}} Cherokee {{artists to}} produce a deep brown {{approaching}} black. Today <b>black</b> <b>walnut</b> is primarily used to dye baskets but {{has been used in}} the past for fabrics and deerhide. Juniper, Juniperus monosperma, ashes provide brown and yellow dyes for Navajo people, as do the hulls of wild walnuts (Juglans major). [...] Khaki, which translates a Hindustani word signifying [...] "soil-coloured", was introduced into British uniforms in India, which were dyed locally with a dye prepared from the native mazari palm Nannorrhops.|$|E
500|$|Both {{native and}} {{non-native}} tree saplings are grown within the forest. Trees officially {{allowed to be}} sold for lumber within the state forest are between 70and100years old. [...] Often, the chosen trees are felled to provide an area for native deer {{to live in the}} open, and to give smaller animals a brush area for their subsistence. Included in some protected areas are the White Oak (...) and the Chestnut Oak/Virginia Pine (20acres) Nature Preserves. [...] Other species of tree include black oak, <b>black</b> <b>walnut,</b> pignut hickory, sugar maples, and tulip trees. [...] North of the Schlamm Lake is a fish hatchery.|$|E
5000|$|Eventually the {{enormous}} number of beetle attacks and subsequent canker formation overwhelms and kills the tree. Thousand cankers is a progressive disease and its effects result from {{the culmination of a}} large number of relatively small cankers over a period of time. Just as a thousand cuts was once used as a form of human execution in Imperial China, <b>black</b> <b>walnuts</b> are subjected to death by thousands of branch and trunk cankers produced by infection from the Geosmithia fungus.|$|R
50|$|Pollination {{requirements}} {{should be}} considered when planting <b>black</b> <b>walnuts.</b> As is typical of many species in Juglandaceae, Juglans nigra trees tend to be dichogamous, i.e.. produce pollen first and then pistillate flowers or else produce pistillate flowers and then pollen. An early pollen-producer should be grouped with other varieties that produce pistillate flowers so all varieties benefit from overlap. Cranz, Thomas, and Neel #1 make a good pollination trio. A similar group for more northern climates would be Sparrow, S127, and Mintle.|$|R
50|$|The Bruces also {{oversaw the}} {{planting}} {{of more than}} 1,000 trees across the rural property. Australian natives, especially the Tasmanian blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) found favour with the Bruces, though {{the vast majority of}} the species planted were European ornamentals. The list of species included poplars (Populus canadensis), Monterey Pinepines (Pinus radiata), pencil pines (Athrotaxis cupressoides), pussy willows (Salix discolor), silver spruces (Picea engelmannii), <b>black</b> <b>walnuts</b> (Juglans nigra), golden elms (Sassafras albidum), silver birchs (Betula pendula), quince (Pseudocydonia sinensis) and white oaks (Quercus arizonica).|$|R
