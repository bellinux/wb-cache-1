50|$|Snoring is the {{vibration}} of respiratory structures {{and the resulting}} sound due to obstructed air movement during breathing while sleeping. In some cases, the sound may be soft, but in most cases, it can be loud and unpleasant.

50|$|Ptosis occurs due to {{dysfunction}} of {{the muscles}} that raise the eyelid or their nerve supply (oculomotor nerve for levator palpebrae superioris and sympathetic nerves for superior tarsal muscle). It can affect one eye or both eyes and {{is more common in}} the elderly, as muscles in the eyelids may begin to deteriorate. One can, however, be born with ptosis. Congenital ptosis is hereditary in three main forms. Causes of congenital ptosis remain unknown. Ptosis may be caused by damage/trauma to the muscle which raises the eyelid, damage to the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion or damage to the nerve (3rd cranial nerve (oculomotor nerve)) which controls this muscle. Such damage could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>or</b> symptom of an underlying disease such as diabetes mellitus, a brain tumor, a pancoast tumor (apex of lung) and diseases which may cause weakness in muscles or nerve damage, such as myasthenia gravis or Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy. Exposure to the toxins in some snake venoms, such as that of the black mamba, may also cause this effect.|$|E

30|$|The {{heartwood}} of the Japanese persimmon tree (Diospyros kaki) becomes {{black on}} rare occasions and has been highly esteemed {{as a substitute for}} ebony. We attempted to clarify how the physical, mechanical, chemical, and biodegradation properties differ between sapwood and blackened heartwood. The specific gravity, equilibrium moisture content, modulus of rupture, and modulus of elasticity in the blackened heartwood were higher, and the loss tangent was lower, than those in sapwood. Furthermore, the blackened portion was more resistant to fungal and termite attacks. A section of heartwood was dark-brown, and the specific gravity and mechanical properties of this portion were slightly lower than those in sapwood. The dark-brown portion was speculated to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>or</b> interrupted state of fungal attack. The blackening substance was bound tightly to cell wall components and could not be extracted with any of the organic solvents used. The findings of trace element analysis using inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry showed that the boron content was markedly high in the blackened portion. The findings obtained here suggest a role of boron in the antifungal properties and the blackening phenomenon of Japanese persimmon.|$|E
40|$|The report {{submitted}} herewith {{presents a}} comprehensive and innovative evaluation of standard and experimental surfaces on roads in Kentucky {{in terms of}} skid resistance and effects of traffic. Criteria for judging suitability of these surfaces to satisfy requirements for skid resistance and economics are also developed and cited therein. Expedient judgments may now {{be made in the}} selection of pavement types most suitable for various traffic volume roads. Failure of a few pavements to meet minimum friction needs tend to spoil the lot. Balancing high goals and standards with economic considerations, only an occasional occurrence of spoiler will be found. Then, to safeguard the public from those pavements found to be excessively slippezy, de-slicking or texturing would be the preferred remedy. Otherwise, advisozy signs warning of the hazard may be posted. "Slippezy When Wet " signs, if left too long, may be adjudged to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>or</b> admission of negli-gence. Skid resistance data gathered over several years were used in. the regression analyses; most of the data were obtained from statewide surveys.

40|$|Raynaud’s {{phenomenon}} (RP) is {{a common}} condition that predominantly occurs among women. The onset age in most cases is under 30 years. The phenomenon was first described by M. Raynaud over 150 years ago. Primary (Raynaud’s disease) and secondary RP were subsequently distinguished. Pathophysiology of RP has not been fully elucidated yet; RP {{seems to be a}} multifactor disease. A pronounced vasospasm in response to stimuli is believed to be caused by disruption in the central and local mechanisms of regulation of vascular tonus. Vascular endothe- lial, intravascular, and neuronal disorders are the key ones among these factors. Structural changes in vessels that can be observed by nailfold capillaroscopy {{play a significant role in}} pathophysiology of secondary RP. The key step in the diagnosis of RP is identifying its clinical variant, since secondary RP may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>or</b> a premonitory symptom of certain autoimmune, hematologic, endocrine, neoplastic, and other disorders. Secondary RP is most frequently observed in patients with systemic rheumatoid diseases. Therapy of secondary RP provides no satisfactory out- comes, since there is no complete conception about the pathophysiological mechanisms of its development. Different groups of drugs are cur- rently used to treat RP, including calcium channels blockers, phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors, endothelin receptor antagonists, etc. This review focuses on pathogenesis, the algorithm of early and differential diagnosis of RP, and current approaches to therapy based on the analysis of the published and our own data.   </div...|$|E
40|$|Aims and objectives: The {{aim of this}} {{cross-country}} Scandinavian {{study was}} to explore how residents in nursing homes experience that their dignity is promoted and attended to. This is one part of the Scandinavian project in which we interviewed residents, relatives and staff members. Background: The main subject concerns the dignity of residents of nursing homes for older people. This article brings forward results from interviews of relatives on how they experience that the dignity is met, promoted and attended to for their next of kin. Design: The study was qualitative with a hermeneutic approach. Methods: Qualitative research interviews of 28 relatives of residents at six participating nursing homes in Scandinavia. The results derive from analysis of the interviews using Kvale’s three levels of interpretation; self-understanding, common sense and a theoretical understanding. Results: The following themes emerged, {{from the perspective of the}} relatives, concerning what was deemed important to the resident according his existential needs and concerns: a). To have a comfortable, homely and practical room. b). To have close contact with family, friends and with the staff. c). To have aesthetic needs and concerns attended to. d). To have ethical needs and intrinsic values attended to. e). To have cultural and spiritual needs and concerns attended to. Conclusion: The results provide more substance to the theme and are all important in terms of the residents’ feeling of worthiness and dignity. In general it seemed that the relatives experienced a positive encounter with the staff, but it was also mentioned that staff members were not confronted about episodes that were undignified and disgraceful. This could <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>sign</b> <b>or</b> expression that they were worried that negative responses or complaints could lead to a kind of reprisal against the resident and to indignit...|$|E
