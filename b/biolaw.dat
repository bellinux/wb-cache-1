40|$|THESIS 10752 I made {{extensive}} use of Trinity College Library, including its older collections and inter- library loan service. Electronic journal databases were invaluable. Researching US constitutional case law was an exercise in logistics and cultivating the virtue of patience. I communicated directly {{with a couple of}} important figures, most especially Habib Malik, the son of Charles Malik, probably the most important, direct philosophical influence on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Some of the research undertaken has unearthed material hitherto either relatively or wholly overlooked in published writings (as far as I can tell, at any rate). This includes aspects of the drafting of various international human rights law texts, the bioethical writings of what are labelled the ?founding forefathers? of US natural rights constitutionalism, and elements of the drafting of the Irish Constitution. As for the major findings, very briefly, there is a sharp cleavage between how dignity, personhood and rights - fundamental human rights and <b>biolaw</b> concepts - are understood in, on the one hand, the foundational human rights texts of the 20 th century, general constitutional law in the natural rights tradition, and human rights <b>biolaw,</b> and, on the other, constitutional <b>biolaw</b> and mainstream <b>biolaw</b> theory. The former paradigm I label that of intrinsic dignity, Boethian personhood and natural rights, the latter extrinsic dignity, Lockean personhood and a (will-) constructivist account of rights. Each paradigm taken individually is internally consistent, while taken together they are, essentially, mutually exclusive. So while human rights <b>biolaw</b> coheres closely with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in the areas of dignity, personhood and rights, this common paradigm diverges significantly from that found in constitutional <b>biolaw</b> and mainstream <b>biolaw</b> theory. Thus at the heart of current <b>biolaw</b> debates lie two competing paradigms concerning foundational concepts relevant to the discipline, and the future direction of <b>biolaw</b> as well as its coherence with the philosophical underpinnings of human rights law will be decided by which of these mutually exclusive paradigms prevails...|$|E

That demands an ethical and legal responses to events that impose the necessity of an ethical control in biotechnology research involving human beings contributing to the rise of Bioethics and <b>Biolaw</b> as fields of knowledge. This theme is studied from a multidisciplinary perspective seeking a dynamic dimension in the interpretation of research data reconnecting Social Sciences to Legal Sciences (<b>Biolaw)</b> and to Philosophy (Bioethics), in order to obtain answers to the problems posed. The objective delimited is to examine the interfaces between <b>Biolaw</b> and Bioethics, in order to observe the confluence of these areas of knowledge. <b>Biolaw</b> is considered as a new legal branch derived from the paradigmatic transition of Law and wonders how it will stand before questions resulting of social transformations caused by biotechnological development that endangers humans and society. It is concluded that the relationship between Bioethics and <b>Biolaw</b> is recursive and inseparable and it contributed to the "unthink" of traditional legal model of linear view/reductionist allowing that the "certainties" will be replaced by "possibilities", which comes to enable <b>Biolaw</b> to confront the issues caused by {{the development of}} biotechnology that violates physically and morally the human person.

40|$|There can {{undoubtedly}} be a procedural approach to reasonableness. Alexy argues that {{conditions such as}} taking "all relevant factors" into account or "putting all relevant factors together in a correct way" are necessary for reasonableness to be pursued—and a fortiori achieved. In the particular field of <b>biolaw,</b> Faralli argues somehow similarly that reasonableness can only be reached when norms proceed from a "shared method of discussion" (rather than from an "antecedent doctrine") {{and if they are}} {{based on the assumption that}} dilemmas faced by <b>biolaw</b> can not be expressed nor analyzed in terms of truth and or falseness but only pretend to be "adequately argued and justified". At any rate, a non-procedural (eg., substantial) approach of reasonableness may well be said to be quite unlikely in early 21 st century European academic settings, for natural law theories articulated around substantial standards of validity are readily said to be out of—scientific—fashion. Indeed, it would have been surprising to hear speakers and the Reasonableness and the Law conference argue that the concept of reasonableness was a promising ground for validating certain conducts and norms as "reasonable," and invalidating others as "unreasonable. " However, the frontier between a procedural and a substantial approach of reasonableness is not easy to draw. Consequently, and despite the above recalled procedural approach to reasonableness, the concept sets the legal theorist on a slippery slope towards axiological assessments of legal cases—a reason for which it will be argued it is best relinquished...|$|E

40|$|The {{principle}} {{of respect for}} human dignity {{plays a crucial role}} in the emerging global norms relating to bioethics, in particular in the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Bioethics and Human Rights. This instrument, which is a legal, not merely an ethical document, can be regarded as an extension of international human rights law into the field of biomedicine. Although the Declaration does not explicitly define human dignity, it would be a mistake to see the emphasis put on this notion as a mere rhetorical strategy. Rather, the appeal to dignity reflects a real concern about the need to promote respect both for the intrinsic worth of human beings and for the integrity of the human species. But dignity alone cannot solve most of the dilemmas posed by biomedical practice. This is why international <b>biolaw</b> combines, on the one hand, the appeal to human dignity as an overarching principle with, on the other hand, the recourse to human rights, which provide an effective and practical way forward for dealing with bioethical issues at a global leve...|$|E
40|$|Informed consent is a {{fundamental}} tenet of medical ethics conjugating ethical imperatives and {{respect for human rights}} in biomedical research {{as well as in the}} exercise of the medical profession. It is considered the foundation of the “new ethos of patient autonomy”, since recognition of autonomy in health care decision-making has enabled and empowered competent patients to retain control of their lives and has come to govern the doctor-patient relationship consistently with respect for the right to self-determination. From the legal viewpoint, informed consent represents a well-established rule of both <b>biolaw</b> and of human rights law. In fact, the bioethical and human rights-based approaches to the life sciences share common foundations and values, converging over the common objective of protecting human dignity and the integrity of every human being from the risks posed by the progress of technology and its applications to the natural processes governing the beginning and the end of life. Hence, in the relative paucity of universally agreed principles providing a framework for ethical conduct in the biomedical field, informed consent – just like the basic principle of respect for human dignity – stands as the cornerstone of biomedical law and human rights law alike...|$|E
40|$|Science and {{technology}} require an intervention by the law, and law is {{called upon to}} intervene {{in front of their}} evolution, and to look for proper solutions of governance and rational responses to their risks. One of the main issues to be investigated from the legal viewpoint is represented by the ‘dual-use dilemma’ that arises both in ‘traditional’ and new areas of techno-sciences. Indeed, any kind of research {{has the potential to be}} used both for bad as well as for good purposes. Therefore, it is important to reflect upon the ways to control possibly dangerous research without preventing the progress from going further. Such ‘dual-use dilemma’, then, entails the study of one of the fundamental freedoms in the <b>biolaw</b> area: the freedom of scientific research, its limits, and relationship with other rights/needs/freedoms (such the need of security). This work focuses on two areas of the techno-scientific world. One is more ‘traditional’, i. e. nuclear science, in whose context the reflections on ‘dual-use’ were born and developed, and the other one is a new emerging technology, which is synthetic biology. The aim is to understand how the freedom of scientific research could be shaped in relationship with other rights/needs/interests for dealing with ‘dual-use’ issues in the aforementioned areas of science {{and technology}}.

40|$|EIn {{this paper}} I intend {{to put forward}} some {{criticism}} of the purely procedural model of bioethics, which, in fact, leads to delegating to biopolitics and <b>biolaw</b> the finding of a purely pragmatic solution to the issues for which bioethics was “invented” over forty years ago. This delegating takes place after {{the transition from the}} thesis, dear to modernity, whereby in ethics reasoning should avoid any discussion regarding its foundation or ultimate justification (Etsi Deus non daretur) to the contemporary affirmation of a substantial ethical agnosticism, which, {{in the name of the}} incommensurability of morals, should construct procedures as if no sole substantial moral were possible (Etsi ethos non daretur) and act as a guarantor of ethical pluralism. These theses will be discussed and an attempt will be made to demonstrate why it is necessary to establish a link between true and good, and how this is possible only by referring to ontology. The conclusion points to the need to propose bioethics explicitly in terms of content that satisfies the presumed axiological neutrality of procedural bioethics, which however, turns out to be theoretically weak and practically unable to protect the ethical pluralism for which it would like to be the guarantor. The conclusion is that only by referring to ontology can bioethics, which is a fully fledged form of moral philosophy, act as a guarantor of pluralism within the truth and oppose the authoritarian tendencies concealed under the liberal guise of ethical agnosticism...|$|E
40|$|This article {{highlights}} the importance of teaching “bioethics and human rights” to undergraduate students seeking health care degrees and illustrates how this topic fits well within these programs of studies. Historical, cultural, anthropological and practical reasons support teaching these topics as enrichment of medical training. The years after the Second World War showed how bioethics, human rights and medicine are closely intertwined. Moreover the relationship between human rights and bioethics has grown ever closer increasingly involving medicine and health care professionals. The authors observe that medical students have to face a cultural pluralism in bioethics and <b>biolaw</b> and we give students the opportunity to develop their critical thinking and logical argumentation abilities as well as their interest in academic research. Furthermore, the authors – who draw up briefly the experience of the Institute of Bioethics at the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery of the UCSC (Rome) - assert the necessity to help medical students to be respectful of patients in every clinical setting. It is therefore of utmost importance to train students to focus on the ethical dimension of care and to make good ethical decisions even in dilemmatic cases. To achieve this outcome, healthcare professionals should possess an integral vision of their work (technical and humanistic competence) and sharp skills to reflect in depth, avoiding superficiality and negligence. From this perspective, the teaching of “bioethics and human rights” could be very useful...|$|E
40|$|The {{judgment}} of the Constitutional Court n. 162 / 2014, which abolished the ban on artificial reproduction with gametes' donation provided by the Italian Law on Medically Assisted Reproduction (MAR), has raised new and lively discussions. The article exposes the debate concerning rules and regulations which should be imposed on MAR via gametes' donation. Although the Law no. 40 / 2004 has been seriously demolished in some important aspects by two constitutional judgments (n. 151 / 2009 and no. 162 / 2014), it is still standing in some of its major components, including the fundamental "balance" expressed in Art. 1 : «in order to resolve problems arising from the human reproductive sterility or infertility», the Law must assure the «rights {{of all of the}} parties involved, including the conceived». The paper deals with both the theme of the fundamental human right to know his/her own origins and the proposal of "adoption for the birth". The former should be recognised also to children born with MAR via gametes' donation. The latter should be taken into account - in place of the ex novo generation of embryos partially or totally unrelated to the couple - for those human embryos left without homologous parental project and abandoned. Every human being, even if just conceived, is one of us: this is the central issue of <b>Biolaw</b> which must be courageously faced and which is suggested by modern culture, founded on the principle of equality in human dignity...|$|E
40|$|The Regulation {{of human}} {{embryonic}} and {{stem cell research}} - a model case for <b>biolaw</b> Research on human embryos has been conducted for forty years, and in vitro embryos undeniably represent the most vulnerable form of human life. Until 1998, embryo research aimed at increasing the general understanding of early human development and at improving the success rate of assisted reproduction. The year 1998 was revolutionary and put human in vitro embryos in a remarkably more vulnerable position. An American research group showed {{that it is possible}} to maintain stem cells isolated from human embryos in a laboratory culture for a longer period of time. Stem cells are a potential material for cell replacement therapy for such degenerative diseases as Alzheimer s disease, Parkinson s disease, diabetes etc. This discovery led to a worldwide stem cell hype and forced legislators worldwide to consider and re-consider their position on the early stages of human life. Adding to the complexity, human embryonic stem cell research was quickly linked to cloning techniques. Researchers foresaw that by using cloning techniques it might be possible to produce embryonic stem cells genetically identical to those of the patient s in a process called therapeutic cloning. This could mean the avoidance of the rejection reaction of the cell grafts. This study was conducted in order to clarify the regulation of human embryonic and stem cell research in Finland. Furthermore, it was envisaged that regulation of human embryonic and stem cell research would be a perfect case to enable analysis of the theoretical basis of a novel legal field, <b>biolaw.</b> More specifically, the aims of the research were: To systematize the legal rules affecting human embryonic research in Finland, and based on the analysis, construct the legal position of the human embryo in Finnish law; To analyse the legal restrictions, including restrictions to gain financial profit, for human embryonic research from the point of view of researchers; To compare the regulation of human embryonic research in the Nordic countries against the framework of Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of the Council of Europe (ETS No. 164); To study the legal status of tissue donors in Finland, and the possibilities to improve that status; and To construct a theoretical framework of the emerging field of <b>biolaw</b> based on the results on the case of regulation of human embryonic and stem cell research. As parts of the research were targeted to different audiences (national vs. international), the form of an article-based thesis was chosen. Individual topics were covered in six articles, and the summary concentrated on the synthesis and construction of <b>biolaw.</b> The main legal sources studied were the national legislation of Finland, Sweden and Norway, the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of the Council of Europe and preparatory works of the mentioned legislation. The literature review was limited to legal articles published for an international audience and to the relevant national sources. Article I published in 2006 analysed and systematized the legal rules concerning human stem cells and their therapeutic use. One of the main findings was that, while Finland had fairly recently enacted legislation concerning research on human embryos (Medical Research Act 488 / 1999), the law was already outdated. The main problem detected was that the definition of human embryo is linked to fertilisation in the Act, which leads to the fact that the Act does apply to entities resulting from therapeutic cloning. The implications of the Tissue Safety Directive (2004 / 23 /EC) to national legislation were also studied, and it was observed that by the time of writing, the amendments required by the Directive had not been made to the Act of the Medical Use of Human Organs and Tissues (101 / 2001). These would mainly relate to the establishment, accreditation and control of tissue establishments. These changes were implemented May 2007. As for therapeutic use of stem cells, it was noted that the European Commission proposes to consider them as advanced medicinal therapies in order to bring them under the medicinal products legislation in the European Community. The resulting Regulation (2007 / 1394 /EC) has been in force since 30 December 2008. Article II of the thesis concentrated on analysing in detail the legal status of embryo under the Finnish law after the passing of Assisted Reproduction Act (1237 / 2006), which finally completed the legal protection of in vitro embryo in Finland. Specifically it was noted that apart from the ban to create embryos solely for research purposes, it appears that the pre-¬requisites for creation of in vitro embryos are not clearly spelled out in the cur¬rent legislation. The wording of the Assisted Reproduction Act was also criticised, as it is easy to get the impression although a false one that if a couple uses donated gametes for assisted reproduction and the resulting embryos are deemed unsuit¬able for that purpose, these embryos cannot be donated to research but are to be destroyed immediately. The basis of the legal status of the in vitro embryo in Finland was also studied. At first sight, because such expressions as create, use and destroy are used in the legislation, it seems that the human embryo should be categorised as an object. Intuitively this is somewhat uncomfortable, though, and a test was made of whether an in vitro embryo could be a legal subject in the Finnish legal order. It seems, however, that this category is fairly impervious to entities other than born human beings. Therefore it was proposed that the human embryo forms a third category between the traditional two categories, being saved from total objecthood by reference to human dignity. Finally, the legal concept of human dignity was developed, suggesting that a reading of human dignity based on the shared values of a given community might provide an answer to questions about the protection of human embryos and the human genome in the context of <b>biolaw.</b> The scope of analysis was changed for Article III, which examined the ambiguity of embryo protection in the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine of the Council of Europe (ETS No. 164). The analysis concentrated on the scrutiny of Article 18 of the Convention, and its interpretative latitude was demonstrated: in order to achieve consensus among the parties, the wording of the Article leaves the fundamental definition of human embryo to be determined within national legislation. Hence it is possible that the three Nordic countries studied can have a very different approach to the human embryonic research in spite of the fact that they all have signed the Convention. Norway was found to be most forbidding, since there, even the research on embryonic stem cell lines was banned at the time of publication of the article in 2007. In contrast, Sweden was found to be most permissive, even allowing the creation of embryos for research purposes. Even though this is specifically forbidden in the Article 18 of the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine, this was possible because Sweden defines human life forms younger than 14 gestational days as fertilised eggs, not embryos. The legislation of Finland was described in the article to be outdated, and it was referred to the outlaw status of the results of therapeutic cloning. The meaning of the phrase adequate protection of the embryo in the context of Article 18 was also studied. As it clearly cannot refer to the protection of actual research embryos which are destroyed during the process, it was concluded that such measure as ensuring that the embryos are only used for scientifically justified projects for which there is no other alternative research material could be an element of fulfilling this provision. Furthermore, means to ensure that the use of human embryos is minimised in each project and that the personnel and equipment are appropriate for the proposed research could be other factors contributing to the fulfillment of adequate protection on embryos. The other half of the articles concentrated on the issues related to commercialising the results of human embryonic and stem cell research. Article IV put embryonic stem cell research into a larger context of genetic research and presented the related current legislation in Finland for such techniques as biobanks, human embryonic and stem cell research, pre-implantation genetic diagnosis, gene therapy and genetically modified organisms. It was concluded that the regulation of this type of research takes place at four distinct levels, namely: legislation, administrative control, professional self-regulation and public opinion. Of these, administrative measures were shown to be of most importance. The Parliamentary legislation of course lays down the basis for the administrative means, but it is scarce and open to interpretation, whereas licensing measures consider all research projects at a very detailed level. Public opinion has traditionally been silent in Finland, and the level of activity of the scientific community towards the public has also been low. Article V analysed a fairly recent and significant decision of the Enlarged Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office (G 02 / 06) from November 2008, in which the patentability of inventions that require the use of human embryos was rejected. The Board rejected the claim of the applicant by stating that the wording of the European Patent Convention (EPC) that forbids issuing patents to inventions using human embryos, does not refer only to actual patent claims, but to an invention as a whole, i. e. including all the necessary steps that need to be de facto taken in order to make the product. The Board also considered that any scientific development taking place after submitting the patent application was irrelevant for the evaluation of the current application. In addition, it was noted that the Board of Appeal was once more reluctant to use the ordre public clause of the EPC as grounds for rejecting a patent claim. Since patenting of embryos is so explicitly mentioned in the EPC, it was possible in this case to base the decision on that provision (Rule 28 (c)) instead of Article 53 (a) of the Convention. The overall importance of the decision for the scientific community was found to be immediate, as the line taken clearly decreased the economic incentive to pursue embryonic stem cell research. And although EPC and the Biopatent Directive (98 / 44 /EC) are distinct legal documents, the case certainly set a precedent for the interpretation of the latter also, since the wording of the embryo clauses are identical. It was foreseen, though, that national patent offices may issue embryo patents that are not in line with the interpretation of the Enlarged Board of Appeal, which may lead to fragmentation of the patent regime in Europe in this regard a situation that EPC was created to correct in the first place. Modern biotechnology produces and uses a lot of human biological material that is potentially economically valuable. It is assumed that somewhere along the chain of action this human material acquires economic value and is owned by somebody. However, it has not been studied how the transition from human tissue to property happens. In the tradition of medical law the donor s consent has been considered essential for the use of human tissue in biomedical research. This was the starting point for Article VI. It was argued that the consent doctrine does not give the donor an adequate role in modern society where human biological material might become a source of income. Instead, it was proposed that tissue donors should be able to claim ownership of the detached tissue and then donate it to biomedical research as a sui generic gift. If the donor so wanted, the gift would only concern the use of the tissue sample while the ownership still resides with the donor. However, allowing ownership of tissue samples would enable the donors to claim compensation if their samples were used against their consent and enable them to give the widest possible research consent if they so wished by giving up the ownership of a sample. In this way, the ownership model would allow tissue donors to become equal actors as compared to the other stakeholders interested in tissue samples. No provisions in current Finnish law seem to invalidate the ownership model, although it needs to be borne in mind that tissue samples, as such, can never have all aspects of property since human tissue cannot be a source of financial gain according to the law. In other words, a tissue sample cannot be a commodity although it is a physical object. By contrast, it was found that the ownership model would not be applicable to in vitro human embryos, which have a special position in the Finnish legal system. Whereas tissue samples are merely detached pieces of an existing human being, embryos have a unique human genome, and hence enjoy special protection due to the human dignity attached to them. This is reflected for example in the fact that one person cannot donate an embryo to research, but the consent of both gamete donors is needed. Based on the results obtained in the individual Articles, a model for <b>biolaw,</b> a legal discipline situated between medical law and environmental law, was constructed in the summary of the thesis. The field would be identified based its regulatory object, namely living material as created by modern biotechnology. The following legal principles of <b>biolaw</b> were identified from the Convention on Human Rights and Biomedicine and the national legislation: respect for human dignity, self-determination, protection of private life, freedom of research, protection of life, banning of commercially benefit from human tissue and the precautionary principle. Legal concepts for <b>biolaw</b> were more difficult to recognise, but such concepts as scientific research, freedom of research, human dignity, research relationship, human, genetic research, gene technology and genetically modified organisms were proposed as legal concepts of <b>biolaw.</b> Finally, it was recognised that it is not desirable to create a new field of law just for the sake of doing it. However, it was argued that if the societal actions lead to a situation where such a field arises, it should not be artificially resisted either. MIHIN IHMISALKIOITA JA KANTASOLUJA SAA KÄYTTÄÄ? Väitöskirjassa selvitettiin alkioiden, kudosnäytteiden ja kantasoluviljelmien käytön oikeudellisia reunaehtoja alkion, tutkijan ja kudosnäytteen luovuttajan näkökulmasta. Kritisoin kansallista sääntelyä siitä, että terapeuttisen kloonauksen tuloksen asema on kotimaisessa lainsäädännössä sääntelemättä sekä sitä, että alkiotutkimukseen liittyvät kriminalisoinnit on mielestäni liian vähäisesti perusteltu vetoamalla ainoastaan kriminalisoitujen tekojen ihmisarvon vastaisuuteen. Mikäli ihmisarvon vastaisuutta käytetään alkiotutkimuksen rajoittamisen perusteena, tulisi lakiehdotuksen perusteluissa avoimesti kertoa, miksi kiellettäväksi säädetty teko on ihmisarvon vastainen. Optimaalisessa tilanteessa tällainen arvio syntyisi laajemman yhteiskunnallisen keskustelun perusteella. Esitin, että eettisillä toimikunnilla voisi olla keskeinen rooli tällaisen keskustelun käynnistäjänä, analysoijana ja yhteenvetäjänä. Vertailin myös Suomen, Ruotsin ja Norjan alkiotutkimusta koskevaa lainsäädäntöä suhteessa Euroopan neuvoston biolääketidespimukseen. Kun näitä kolmea eroavaa kansallista lainsäädäntöä peilattiin sopimuksen tekstiä vasten, oli ilmeistä, kuinka paljon harkintamarginaalia alkiotutkimuksen osalta sopimuksessa jää sopimusvaltioille. Ihmisalkioilla tehtävä tutkimus on toimintaa, jonka sallittavuudesta on hyvin erilaisia näkemyksiä Euroopan sisällä globaalista tarkastelusta puhumattakaan. Biolääketiedesopimuksen sanamuoto olikin tietoinen kompromissi, jota oli tarkoitus tarkentaa erillisessä lisäpöytäkirjassa. Pöytäkirjaa valmisteleva työryhmä on saanut jatkoaikaa toiminnalleen, ja sen tuorein mandaatti oli voimassa vuoden 2009 loppuun asti. Tutkimuksessa analysoitiin myös kudosnäytteiden luovuttajan oikeusasemaa ja mahdollisuuksia parantaa sitä vallitsevan lainsäädännön puitteissa. Kaikki ihmiset ovat potentiaalisia kantasoluviljelmien lähteitä, ja soluviljelmien ja kudosnäytekokoelmien ollessa uuden genomitiedon valossa mahdollisesti kaupallisesti hyvinkin arvokkaita, oli tarpeen tarkastella takaavatko nykyiset oikeussäännöt riittävät oikeussuojakeinot kudosnäytteiden luovuttajille. Päädyin siihen, että sekä tutkijoiden että näytteenluovuttajien näkökulmasta olisi selkeämpää ja oikeudenmukaisempaa nähdä kudosnäyte esineenä, johon luovuttajalla on omistusoikeus, jonka hän voi sitten kokonaan tai osittain luovuttaa tutkijalle. Omistusoikeuskonstruktiossa olisi mahdollista sopia myös tulevan taloudellisen hyödyn jakamisesta. Niin ikään säännökset mahdollisesta hyvityksestä omistusoikeutta loukattaessa olisivat selkeämmät. Myös alkioperäiset solutuotteet ovat potentiaalisesti taloudellisesti arvokkaita, ja tutkimuksessa pyrittiin selvittämään myös alkioiden kaupalliseen hyödyntämiseen liittyviä kysymyksiä. Tutkin Euroopan patenttiviraston marraskuussa 2008 antamaa ratkaisua, jossa yksiselitteisesti evättiin patentit sellaisilta tuotteilta, joiden valmistaminen vaatii alkioiden tuhoamisen. Patenttioikeudellisesta näkökulmasta eurooppalainen alkio- ja kantasolututkimus joutui ratkaisun myötä aikaisempaa huonompaan asemaan kahdesta syystä: ensinnäkin taloudellinen kannustin alkio- ja kantasolututkimuksen tekemiselle pieneni selvästi ja toisaalta eurooppalainen käytäntö pirstaloitui jälleen, kun kansalliset alkiopatentit ovat ainakin toistaiseksi periaatteessa mahdollisia niin kauan kuin EY-tuomioistuin ei ole antanut vastaavaa tulkintaa bioteknologiadirektiivistä. Väitöstutkimuksen tavoitteena oli paitsi analysoida edellä kerrotuista näkökulmista alkio- ja kantasolututkimuksen säätelyä myös tutkia, voisiko tuon analyysin perusteella hahmottaa bio-oikeuden yleisiä periaatteita ja käsitteitä, ja voisiko bio-oikeus tällä perusteella olla mahdollisesti itsenäinen oikeudenala. Esitin, että bio-oikeus on itsenäistymässä oleva oikeudenala, jolla on lääkintäoikeudesta erilliset kysymyksenasettelut johtuen siitä, että sääntelyn kohde on eri, modernin bioteknologian tuottamat objektit. Tästä seuraten bio-oikeuden periaatteet ja käsitteet ovat osittain toiset kuin lääkintä-oikeuden, vaikka niiden pohjana olevat oikeuslähteet ovatkin pitkälti samat. Toiselta laidaltaan bio-oikeus on siis kiinni lääkintäoikeudessa, toiselta laidaltaan puolestaan ympäristöoikeudessa. Ainoastaan aika näyttää, miten oikeusjärjestyksemme kehittyy ja vakiintuuko bio-oikeus siihen itsenäisenä oikeudenalana...|$|E

Busca-se, com isso, demonstrar as preocupações éticas em torno do tema que, em razão de sua natureza, por envolver interesses ligados à vida humana e à proteção ao meio ambiente, deram impulso ao desenvolvimento dos Princípios Bioéticos. Assim, discute as interrelações existentes entre esse novo ramo do saber e o tratamento dado às questões ligadas à biotecnologia. E, em razão da relevância em torno destes fatos e as conseqüências que lhe são inerentes, entende-se como inevitáveis as influências no âmbito jurídico, destacando-se a criação de novos institutos jurídicos, que surgem enquadrados no novo ramo do Biodireito. Ressalta-se, assim, a importância do Princípio da Precaução para o melhor e adequado tratamento dos problemas envolvendo biossegurança, seja do ponto de vista bioético, seja do ponto de vista biojurídico, tendo em vista a sua inserção no ordenamento jurídico pátrio, sobretudo diante de previsão expressa trazida pela Lei n. º 11. 105 / 05. Procuramos demonstrar como o seu surgimento se dá juntamente com a evolução do conhecimento que, em razão de seu avanço, cria maiores possibilidades de intervenção do ser humano no meio ambiente e em seu próprio organismo. Destacamos, por fim, os seus mais importantes aspectos no momento de se determinar a responsabilidade em biossegurança tendo em vista as normas atualmente previstas no âmbito da atual Lei de Biossegurança.

This essay has as {{objective}} {{an analysis}} of the significant role of the Precautionary Principle (PP) in the present scene, that’s it, the stage of grand technologic leaps, notably in regard to biotech activities, which is providing, at the same time, many feelings of hope for a promising future and uncertainties and occasional health and environmental risks to the society. We seek, with that, to demonstrate the ethical concerns around a subject which, by its own nature, involves connected interests to the human and wildlife conservation that started the development of Bioethics principles. In that way, the existing inter-relations between this new branch of knowledge and its treatment in view of the questioning about biotechnology are discussed. And, given the importance around these facts and its inherent results, its influence to the legal sphere are taken as inevitable, distinguishing the creation of new legal institutes, fitted in the new branch of <b>BioLaw.</b> It stands out the importance of Precautionary Principle to better and adequate deal with biosafety issues, be it from the bioethics, or the <b>BioLaw</b> point of view, because of its national legal arrangement insertion, mainly on account of the expressed due conveyed by Law no. 11. 105 / 05. We evince that its emergence occurs along with the development of knowledge, and because this development, more possibilities of human intervention in the environment and in its own organic structure are created. At last, we take note of the important aspects when determining biosafety responsibilities, in light of the Biosafety Law precepts at present. Thus, with legislative, doctrinal, and jurisprudential analysis, and by means of deductive-intuitive method, through a criticdialectic approach on the topic, we evidence, finally, the means by which an PP adjustment to the national reality will be made, so that it will not hinder involved interests on biotech research, to the extent that its conceptual [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The study aims {{to provide}} an {{analysis}} of advance directives (ADs, more commonly known as “living wills”) in the contemporary legal experience. The paper is divided in two parts, which correspond to the different approaches adopted in the research: the issues related to advance directives are examined in the first part; in the second one, the {{attention is focused on}} the civil profiles of advance directives and on the possibilities for their implementation in the Italian legal system. The first chapter, which includes an introduction about <b>biolaw,</b> is dedicated to give some terminological clarifications and to show the main differences between advance directives and last wills. The second and the third chapters, respectively, deal with the topics connected to the “right to die” (especially the assisted suicide and euthanasia in the decisions of the ECHR and in the legislations of the Netherlands and Belgium) and with the informed consent. A particular importance is given to the analysis of the French Code de la santé publique and of the U. S. and British case law (Quinlan, Cruzan, Bland). The second part of the paper offers a reconstruction of the legal instruments which can be used to protect the will and the personal identity of the patient. First of all, a fundamental principle which emerges from the Italian jurisprudence is that advance directives, despite the lack of a specific legislation, are normally binding. However, it seems that the best choice in order to guarantee the intangibility of the patient’s body is to adopt advance care planning and to establish a balanced relationship with the doctor. A complex problem, which is considered in the last chapter, regards the possibility for a patient to be substituted in his health care decisions when he lacks capacity. In the last years, this possibility has been acknowledged by the Italian Supreme Court of Cassation referring to the institutes of the interdiction and of the “amministrazione di sostegno”. The concluding paragraphs aim to demonstrate that a similar substitution could be implemented, without the necessity of a constant judicial control, through the analogical application of general principles and the regulations concerning the mandate and the power of attorney...|$|E
