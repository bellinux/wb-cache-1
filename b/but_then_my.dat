6000|$|... "Learning {{is better}} than house and land," [...] said Mrs Carey; [...] "though I'm no scholar myself; <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> in <b>my</b> time, things was different. But young persons--" ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>But</b> <b>then</b> would <b>my</b> parents wish {{their only}} child to be {{actually}} without breakfast? Having this money, and being so hungry, so VERY hungry, mightn't I take ever so little? Mightn't I at home eat as much as I chose? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I cannot think, Fanny, {{how you get}} on so quick," [...] said Mrs. Damer. [...] "I'm always last; <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> donkey is such a very nasty one. Look there, now; he's {{always trying}} to get me off." ...|$|E
6000|$|You {{figure that}} empty mean street, emptily echoing to my footsteps--no soul awake and audible <b>but</b> me. <b>Then</b> <b>my</b> halt at the placard.

5000|$|Told {{that younger}} Jewish players {{look up to}} him, Levy said: [...] "It's nice to hear that. I want to {{represent}} Israel and the Jewish people the best I can.

6000|$|... "'In {{my young}} days,' Lady Lapith went on, 'I {{should have been}} laughed out of countenance if I'd said a thing like that. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> in <b>my</b> young days souls weren't as fashionable {{as they are now}} and we didn't think death was at all poetical.

6000|$|... "We do, indeed, {{proceed on}} our {{investigations}} occasionally with exceeding little information to go upon, <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> dear sir, investigation {{may be said}} to be a branch of our profession, for which we are in a manner specially trained.

60|$|Isaac. Oh, yes, presently.--Such deceit! says he.--Pish! {{says the}} lady, tricking is all fair in love. <b>But</b> <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> friend, says he.-- Psha! damn your friend, says I. So, poor wretch, {{he has no}} chance.-- No, no; he may hang himself {{as soon as he}} pleases.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> I put <b>my</b> {{quarterly}} wants at a {{very low}} figure; a figure that would be quite unsuitable--quite unintelligible to the nephew of a Croesus." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{is that a}} reason?" [...] {{said our}} Martha. [...] "Had I been in her place I would not have put my foot in his house again till I was assured that my friend should be as welcome there as myself. <b>But</b> <b>then,</b> perhaps, <b>my</b> ideas of {{friendship}} may be called romantic." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You {{would not}} speak to my father on the subject?" [...] said Lucy, doubtingly; and then added more warmly: [...] "Oh do not--do not!

6000|$|... "For a time I {{could not}} believe the heresies which I heard, and I prayed that my {{daughter}} Thuvia might have died before she ever committed the sacrilege of returning to the outer world. <b>But</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> father's love asserted itself, and I vowed that I would prefer eternal damnation to further separation from her if she could be found.|$|E
60|$|I {{was about}} to turn in the {{direction}} of Walford, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> into <b>my</b> trouble-tossed mind there came the recollection that I had intended, no matter what happened, to call on the Larramies before I went home.

6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been an {{extraordinary}} circumstance truly," [...] she said, [...] "that a man should have grown white-headed on the seas, and never have been struck with so noble a spectacle. <b>But</b> <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> honest tar, you appear to be wrong in overlooking the striking faults in yonder ship, which this, a--a--this gentleman has just, and so properly, named." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very true, Your Majesty," [...] said Colonel Plum, eagerly. [...] "There {{are many}} kinds of bravery and one cannot be {{expected}} to possess them all. I myself am brave as a lion in all ways until it comes to fighting, <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> nature revolts.

6000|$|... "Well, <b>but</b> <b>then,</b> <b>my</b> boy," [...] said Uncle Glegg, whose {{good feeling}} {{led him to}} enter into Tom's wish, but who could not at once shake off his {{habitual}} abhorrence of such recklessness as destroying securities, or alienating anything important enough to make an appreciable difference in a man's property, [...] "we should have to make away wi' the note, you know, if we're to guard against what may happen, supposing your father's made bankrupt----" ...|$|E
60|$|He neither spoke nor loosed {{his hold}} for some five minutes, during which period he {{bestowed}} more kisses than ever {{he gave in}} his life before, I daresay: <b>but</b> <b>then</b> <b>my</b> mistress had kissed him first, and I plainly saw that he could hardly bear, for downright agony, to look into her face!

6000|$|... "I think, mother, that I had best continue, {{for some}} time, as I am. You see I have, at present, {{nothing in common}} with the English except their blood.
