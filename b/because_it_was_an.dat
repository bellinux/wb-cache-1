This was a remarkable honour, not only because he held this office early under the new regime, but also <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> ordinary consulship (instead of a less prestigious suffect consulship), making {{him one of the}} few non-Flavians to be honoured in this way under Vespasian. After 71 Nerva again disappears from historical record, presumably continuing his career as an inconspicuous advisor under Vespasian (69–79) and his sons Titus (79–81) and Domitian (81–96).|$|E

Major Caleb Gibbs of Rhode Island was the first commander of the Guard, and was given the title of captain commandant. Gibbs was succeeded in 1779 by William Colfax.|$|E

25|$|In heraldry, a unicorn {{is often}} {{depicted}} as a horse with a goat's cloven hooves and beard, a lion's tail, and a slender, spiral horn on its forehead (non-equine attributes may be replaced with equine ones, {{as can be seen}} from the following gallery). Whether <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> emblem of the Incarnation or of the fearsome animal passions of raw nature, the unicorn was not widely used in early heraldry, but became popular from the 15th century. Though sometimes shown collared and chained, which may be taken as an indication that it has been tamed or tempered, it is more usually shown collared with a broken chain attached, showing that it has broken free from its bondage.|$|E
25|$|The Permian {{began with}} the Carboniferous flora still flourishing. About {{the middle of the}} Permian there was a major {{transition}} in vegetation. The swamp-loving lycopod trees of the Carboniferous, such as Lepidodendron and Sigillaria, were replaced by the more advanced conifers, which were better adapted to the changing climatic conditions. Lycopods and swamp forests still dominated the South China continent <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> isolated continent and it sat near or at the equator. The Permian saw the radiation of many important conifer groups, including the ancestors of many present-day families. The ginkgos and cycads also appeared during this period. Rich forests were present in many areas, with a diverse mix of plant groups. The gigantopterids thrived during this time; some of these may {{have been part of the}} ancestral flowering plant lineage, though flowers evolved only considerably later.|$|E
25|$|The Tree is {{also often}} found in Psalters, {{especially}} English manuscripts, illustrating the B initial of Beatus Vir, the beginning of Psalm 1, which often occupies a whole page. Sometimes {{this is the only}} fully illuminated page, and if it is historiated (i.e. contains a pictured scene) the Tree is the usual subject. When not historiated, the initial had for about two hundred years been most often made up of, or filled with, spiraling plant tendrils, often with animals or men caught up in them, so the development to the tree was a relatively easy step. Indeed, although Jesse's son David was believed to be the author of the Psalms, {{it has been suggested that}} the tradition of using a Jesse Tree here arose largely <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> imposing design that worked well filling a large B shape.|$|E

25|$|On {{the second}} {{play of the}} second quarter, Reggie Bush {{exploded}} for 35yards off a Leinart pass, reaching Texas's 18-yard line before attempting to lateral pass the ball to an uncovered teammate; Texas strong safety Michael Huff recovered the loose ball. The Pac-10 football-officiating coordinator later stated that Bush's pass was incorrectly officiated <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> illegal forward pass, not a lateral, so the Trojans should have retained possession. Young drove his team 53yards on the ensuing possession, twice hitting senior tight end David Thomas, who finished the day as Young's leading receiver, catching ten passes for 88yards. The Trojans' defense tackled sophomore running back Ramonce Taylor fiveyards behind {{the line of scrimmage}} and forced a fumble that Young recovered for an additional five-yard loss. This forced a Texas field-goal attempt, which David Pino converted from 46yards to cut Texas's deficit to four.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, US Congress {{passed a}} {{prohibition}} law outlawing the manufacturing and transporting of drinking alcohol. When drinking became illegal, it became popular in underground nightclubs. The {{type of music}} that was played at these underground establishments that were selling alcohol was jazz. It was not seen as upstanding to listen to or perform jazz music, <b>because</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> African American style {{and at that time}} the United States was segregated and racism was an overtly prevalent issue. Because jazz music was seen as great dance music, big band jazz became popular in nightclubs. In the 1920s, freelance drummers emerged. They were hired to play shows, concerts, theaters, clubs and back dancers and artists of various genres. Just as modern drummers have many different roles, so did the drummers of the 1920s. One important role for drummers in the 1920s is what is referred to in modern times as a foley artist. During silent films, an orchestra was hired to accompany the silent film and the drummer was responsible for providing all the sound effects. Drummers played instruments to imitate gun shots, planes flying overhead, a train coming into a train station, and galloping horses etc.|$|E
