5|$|There were no {{facilities}} in Port Moresby for the <b>bulk</b> <b>storage</b> of petroleum products, {{so they were}} shipped and distributed in 44-gallon drums, as they were known in SWPA, where food and fuel distribution was through the Australian Army, which used the imperial gallon. A shortage of 44-gallon drums developed in late 1942. Some 150,000 went north but only 10,000 returned. New production was ordered from Rheem in Australia, and civilian holders of 44-gallon drums were urged to empty and return them. Unserviceable drums were either repaired by the Bulk Issues Petrol and Oil Depot (BIPOD) or handed over to salvage. A well-organised collection effort was undertaken by the Port Moresby Base Sub Area which resulted in over 20,000 empty drums being returned to Australia in November.|$|E
25|$|A silo is a {{structure}} for storing bulk materials. Silos {{are used in}} agriculture to store grain, see grain elevators, or fermented feed known as silage. Silos are more commonly used for <b>bulk</b> <b>storage</b> of grain, coal, cement, carbon black, woodchips, food products and sawdust. The first modern silo, a wooden and upright one filled with grain, was invented and built in 1873 by Fred Hatch of McHenry County, Illinois.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to encourage policy makers to craft policies that support environmentally sound design practices while integrating <b>bulk</b> energy <b>storage</b> into the electricity grid. <b>Bulk</b> energy <b>storage</b> technology can regulate electricity coming into the grid from different energy sources. Grid flexibility is a powerful tool to empower the clean energy movement because it enables the integration of renewable energy into the electrical grid. However, storage technology has the potential to become another one of the many “tragedy of commons”, considering that there are no regulations forcing storage companies to pursue environmental-friendly operation. <b>Bulk</b> energy <b>storage</b> devices which earn income through arbitrage, have the potential to increase grid emissions. Both energy losses and the variety of energy grid resources, largely damper the environmental advantages of <b>bulk</b> energy <b>storage</b> devices. By using a linear programming formulation that considers both revenue and emissions, this thesis proposes operational solutions where <b>bulk</b> energy <b>storage</b> technologies can retain a high revenue while simultaneously reducing their emissions from the current eGRID sub-regions. These results can be achieved by explicitly demanding small inexpensive changes in the operation of the system. Usually, only a few companies will follow sustainable practices by themselves. Therefore, a variety of policy implementations are suggested to support environmentally sound design principals for <b>bulk</b> energy <b>storage</b> technology...|$|R

25|$|Storing {{water and}} food was {{critical}} for survival, and particularly, being able to store enough food for use from one harvest to the next. To protect grain from damp and vermin, underground granaries {{were used for the}} <b>bulk</b> <b>storage</b> of grain. Families also stored grain, wine and oil in large pottery jars in their houses. When well protected, wheat, barley, legumes and nuts could be kept for long periods. Rainwater from roofs and courtyards was collected in cisterns to supplement natural sources like springs and wells.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the capital}} outlay can be high, it is {{desirable}} to use a meter-mix or dispense unit for even low-volume production operations that require a steady output of finished parts. Dispense equipment consists of material holding (day) tanks, metering pumps, a mix head, and a control unit. Often, a conditioning or heater-chiller unit is added to control material temperature {{in order to improve}} mix efficiency, cure rate, and to reduce process variability. Choice of dispense equipment components depends on shot size, throughput, material characteristics such as viscosity and filler content, and process control. Material day tanks may be single to hundreds of gallons in size, and may be supplied directly from drums, IBCs (intermediate bulk containers, such as totes), or <b>bulk</b> <b>storage</b> tanks. They may incorporate level sensors, conditioning jackets, and mixers. Pumps can be sized to meter in single grams per second up to hundreds of pounds per minute. They can be rotary, gear, or piston pumps, or can be specially hardened lance pumps to meter liquids containing highly abrasive fillers such as chopped or hammer milled glass fibres and wollastonite.|$|E

500|$|A {{two-level}} hangar {{was built}} under the flight deck, each level being [...] high. The lower hangar was [...] long by [...] wide {{and the upper}} was [...] Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers. Her boilers were ducted {{down the side of}} the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck, or, when landing operations were in progress, out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship. This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space, made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree. Her original flying-off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters so that the ship could simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck and could speedily launch her aircraft from both decks. Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck. Two [...] lifts (elevators) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars. Two [...] ready-use petrol tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship's boats on the upper deck. An additional [...] of petrol were in <b>bulk</b> <b>storage.</b> The longitudinal arresting gear proved unpopular in service and it was ordered removed in 1927 after tests aboard Furious in 1926 had shown that deck-edge palisades were effective in reducing cross-deck gusts that could blow aircraft over the side. Furiouss long exhaust ducting hampered landing operations, and restricted the size of the hangars and thus the number of aircraft that she could carry.|$|E
