40|$|This article {{presents}} {{details of the}} development of a special class of laminate, possessing Extension-Shearing <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling,</b> necessary for optimised passive-adaptive flexible wing-box structures. The possibility of achieving a measurable drag reduction in cruise flight, without the cost or reliability issues associated with active control mechanisms, is of significant interest for achieving increased fuel burn efficiency, and meeting associated emissions targets. The introduction of passive <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> at the wing-box level has been previously demonstrated through laminate level tailoring with Extension-Shearing coupling only, but the limited design space and the possibility for ply terminations (to produce tapered thickness) effectively rule out this special class of laminate for practical construction. The study is now broadened to consider laminates with Extension-Shearing and <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling,</b> beyond the less well-known un-balanced and symmetric design rule or indeed balanced and symmetric designs with off-axis alignment. Results reveal a vast laminate design space with Extension-Shearing coupling that can be maximised without the unfavourable strength characteristics associated with off-axis alignment. Results also reveal that shear buckling strength can be maximised through <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> when load reversal is not a design constraint...|$|E
40|$|This article {{describes}} the development of closed form polynomial equations for compression and shear buckling to assess the effect of <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> on infinitely long laminated plates with simply supported edges. The equations are used to generate contour maps, representing non-dimensional buckling factors, which are superimposed on the lamination parameter design spaces for laminates with standard ply orientations. The contour maps are applicable to two recently developed databases containing symmetric and non-symmetric laminates with either Bending-Twisting or Extension-Shearing <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling.</b> The contour maps provide new insights into buckling performance improvements that are non-intuitive and facilitate comparison between hypothetical and practical designs. The databases are illustrated through point clouds of lamination parameter coordinates, which demonstrate the effect of applying common design heuristics, including ply angle, ply percentage and ply contiguity constraints...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} part of the study, finite element {{solutions}} are presented for the optimal design of symmetrically laminated rectangular plates subject to a combination of simply supported, clamped and free boundary conditions. The design objective is the maximisation of the biaxial buckling load by determining the fibre orienta-tions optimally with the effects of <b>bending-twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> taken into account. The finite element method coupled with an optimisation routine is employed in analysing and optimising the laminated plate designs. The effect of boundary conditions, the number of layers and <b>bending-twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> on the optimal ply angles and the buckling load are numerically studied. Optimal buckling designs of symmetrically laminated rectangular plates un-der in-plane uniaxial loads which have a nonuniform distribution along the edges are presented in the second part of the study. In particular, point loads, partial uniform loads and nonuniform loads are considered in addition to uniformly dis-tributed in-plane loads which provide the benchmark solutions.

40|$|The load {{mitigation}} {{prospects of}} a blade that twists toward feather as it bends is {{addressed in this}} paper. For this investigation, the ADAMS-WT software has been modified to include blade models with <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling.</b> Models of a representative rotor oper-ating at a constant speed are developed for several val-ues of the <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling</b> coefficient, all in a range that assures positive definiteness of the structural stiffness. Using the twist-coupled models, the ADAMS software is exercised for a spectrum of stochastic wind time series. This spectrum contains time series with three mean wind speeds at two turbulence levels. Fa-tigue damage calculations are done for the generated load histories using a range of material exponents that represent materials from welded steel to aluminum to composites, and results are compared with the damage computed for the rotor without twist-coupling. Power output for the various cases is also monitored to deter-mine power deviations resulting from the coupling. Results indicate that for high but physically attainable levels of the coupling coefficient, significant reductions in damage are achieved across the spectrum of applied wind loading...|$|R
40|$|In the {{preliminary}} design phase of an offshore wind turbine, a complete aerodynamic model {{is not required}} to assess its feasibility. As a result, engineers often switch to a simple model which is reliable and efficient, economically and computationally. Such a simplified model is based on the research interest. The main objective of this project is to study the aerodynamic interaction of a Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) blade. The aerodynamic interaction is basically the dependency of the relative wind velocity experienced by the blade on its structural response. Since the aerodynamic forces depend on the relative wind velocity, the interaction influences the force experienced by the blade. In addition, the cross-section of the blade is generally asymmetric, which results in a <b>coupled</b> <b>bending-twist</b> vibration of the blade, consequently influencing the aerodynamic interaction. Therefore, this project incorporates the <b>coupled</b> <b>bending-twist</b> vibration of the blade along with the introduction of gravity. A rotating blade is modeled accounting the <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling</b> by assuming a singly symmetric cross-section of the blade, which introduces an eccentricity between the center of mass and the elastic axis. The centrifugal force introduced due to the rotation of the blade, which induces an additional bending stiffness to the blade, is incorporated into the model. The relative wind velocity experienced by the blade is then defined by generating the wind profile from the Kaimal turbulence spectrum and incorporating the structural response. Due to the inclusion of torsional motion, the relative wind velocity varies along the chord line of the airfoil. Therefore, a point is selected along the chord line, generally the third-quarter chord point from {{the leading edge of the}} airfoil, for the definition of the relative wind velocity. Henceforth, the aerodynamic loads are defined and parametric studies are performed in order to assess the influence of gravity, aerodynamic interaction and <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling</b> on the structural response of the blade. It is found that the gravity induces a harmonic motion to the blade when rotating. In the case of a standstill blade, it only induces a static deformation due to the self-weight of the blade. The aerodynamic interaction is found to introduce an additional mass and damping to the system due to the dependency of the aerodynamic forces on the structural response acceleration and velocity, respectively. These added mass and stiffness result in lowering of the natural frequency of the system and significant damping of the structural response, predominantly in the flapwise direction when rotating. The <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling</b> is found to be dominant for the edgewise-torsional vibration. Civil Engineering and GeosciencesStructural EngineeringStructural Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|Symmetric and antisymmetric layup graphite-epoxy {{composite}} beams with thin-walled rectangular cross sections are fabricated using an autoclave molding technique and tested under bending, torsional, and extensional loads. The bending slope and elastic twist at a station are measured using an optical system, {{and the results}} correlated with predicted values from a simple beam analysis {{as well as a}} refined finite element analysis. A symmetric ply layup results in <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling</b> whereas an antisymmetric layup causes extension-twist coupling. Simple analytical results with plane-stress assumption agree better with measured data as well as finite element predictions than with plane-strain assumption. For symmetric layup beams, the bending-induced twist and torsion-induced bending slope are predicted satisfactorily using simple analytical solution. Correlations with measured data, however, are generally improved using a finite element solution. For antisymmetric beams, axial force-induced twist is predicted satisfactorily by both methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{definitive}} list of extension-shearing and bending-twisting coupled composite laminates, {{with up to}} 21 plies, is presented. The listings {{comprise of}} individual stacking sequences, which are characterized in terms of angle- and cross-ply sub-sequence symmetries {{as well as the}} blend-ratio of un-balanced angle-plies. Dimensionless parameters are provided, from which the extensional and bending stiffnesses are readily calculated for any fibre/matrix system and angle-ply orientation. Comparisons are made between the structural response of the new extension-shearing and bending-twisting coupled laminates and others possessing both extension-shearing coupling only or <b>bending-twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> only, which typically arise in un-balanced and symmetric or balanced and symmetric designs, respectively. These comparisons involve the buckling interaction of infinitely long plates, which serve to isolate the effects of each form of coupling behaviour and highlight the detrimental effects of <b>bending-twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> on compression buckling strength as well as the beneficial effects on shear buckling strength. Finally, the scope for laminate tapering is investigated, using single or multiple ply terminations...|$|E
40|$|Mathematical {{formulations}} and a closed-form analytical {{solution to}} compute buckling loads of simply supported balanced symmetric laminated composite plates subjected to combined in-plane bi-axial and shear loading is presented. All the possible combinations of axial and transverse load i. e., compression and tension are considered {{in conjunction with}} the in-plane shear loads. The effects of both the transverse shear deformation and the <b>bending-twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> are considered simultaneously in buckling analysis. The numerical results obtained from the present analysis are benchmarked against the results available in open literature. New results for buckling load factors along with buckling interaction curves for isotropic plates subjected to combined in plane bi-axial and shear loads are presented. Typical laminated composite plate lay-ups are analyzed for buckling under combined axial and shear loading. For thin laminated composite plates subjected to pure shear or combined in plane and shear loads, the buckling load factors are significantly reduced when the bending-twisting (anisotropy) coupling terms are included in the analysis. However, in the buckling analysis of thick laminated composite plates, both the effects of transverse shear deformation and the <b>bending-twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> should be considered simultaneously to avoid a non-conservative error in the prediction of buckling load factors.

40|$|This article {{presents}} definitive stacking sequence listings for tapered, warp-free balanced plain weave and non-crimp fabric (NCF) laminate designs {{with and without}} Extension-Shearing and/or <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> behaviour. With few exceptions, tapered designs for uni-directional (UD) material are currently certified only for balanced and symmetric laminate construction, despite the severe design constraint that 1 angle-ply termination therefore requires a further 3 angle-ply terminations. By contrast, an extensive design space has recently been discovered for tapered UD laminates with single ply terminations, including single angle-ply terminations, representing unconventional laminate designs with unbalanced and/or non-symmetric stacking sequences. Such designs give rise to Bending-Twisting and/or Extension-Shearing coupling: Extension-Shearing coupling, which arises in unbalanced construction, can be exploited to produce bending-twisting deformation in aircraft wing-box structures when top and bottom skins have identical bias fibre alignment, but equally, this can be eliminated with opposing bias fibre alignment; <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling,</b> which is generally present in symmetric laminate construction, results in weaker compression buckling strength compared to the equivalent fully uncoupled laminate (with matching stiffness properties), but with potentially stronger shear buckling strength. Single ply terminations applied to NCF or balanced plain weave materials are equivalent to two adjacent ply terminations in traditional UD materials, and therefore introduce a constraint that may reduce the design space substantially, particularly in ‘thin laminate’ designs. However, this can be overcome by adopting ‘thin-ply’ or ‘spread-tow’ technology, which will allow an exponential increase in tailoring opportunities by bringing design flexibilities, found only in traditionally thick laminate construction, into the thin laminate domain. Thin-ply technology will, for instance, offer {{the prospect of a}} repeating 8 -ply NCF laminate, with a similar thickness to that of a single ply of traditional UD material. This design also follows the repeating bi-angle philosophy, possessing Extension-Shearing and <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling,</b> but now with immunity to thermal warping distortions, which are eliminated in bi-angle laminates only when the number (r) of repeats becomes very large...|$|E
40|$|The load {{mitigation}} {{and energy}} capture characteristics of twist-coupled HAWT blades that are {{mounted on a}} variable speed rotor are investigated in this paper. These blades are designed to twist toward feather as they bend with pretwist set to achieve a desirable twist distribution at rated power. For this investigation, the ADAMS-WT software has been modified to include blade models with <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling.</b> Using twist-coupled and uncoupled models, the ADAMS software is exercised for steady wind environments to generate C{sub p} curves {{at a number of}} operating speeds to compare the efficiencies of the two models. The ADAMS software is also used to generate the response of a twist-coupled variable speed rotor to a spectrum of stochastic wind time series. This spectrum contains time series with two mean wind speeds at two turbulence levels. Power control is achieved by imposing a reactive torque on the low speed shaft proportional to the RPM squared with the coefficient specified so that the rotor operates at peak efficiency in the linear aerodynamic range, and by limiting the maximum RPM {{to take advantage of the}} stall controlled nature of the rotor. Fatigue calculations are done for the generated load histories using a range of material exponents that represent materials from welded steel to aluminum to composites, and results are compared with the damage computed for the rotor without twist-coupling. Results indicate that significant reductions in damage are achieved across the spectrum of applied wind loading without any degradation in power production...|$|R
40|$|There is a {{potential}} for improving the performance and aeroelastic stability of tiltrotors {{through the use of}} elastically-coupled composite rotor blades. To study the characteristics of tiltrotors with these types of rotor blades it is necessary to formulate a new analysis which has the capabilities of modeling both a tiltrotor configuration and an anisotropic rotor blade. Background for these formulations is established in two preliminary investigations. In the first, the influence of several system design parameters on tiltrotor aeroelastic stability is examined for the high-speed axial flight mode using a newly-developed rigid-blade analysis with an elastic wing finite element model. The second preliminary investigation addresses the accuracy of using a one-dimensional beam analysis to predict frequencies of elastically-coupled highly-twisted rotor blades. Important aspects of the new aeroelastic formulations are the inclusion of a large steady pylon angle which controls tilt of the rotor system with respect to the airflow, the inclusion of elastic pitch-lag coupling terms related to rotor precone, the inclusion of hub-related degrees of freedom which enable modeling of a gimballed rotor system and engine drive-train dynamics, and additional elastic coupling terms which enable modeling of the anisotropic features for both the rotor blades and the tiltrotor wing. Accuracy of the new tiltrotor analysis is demonstrated by a comparison of the results produced for a baseline case with analytical and experimental results reported in the open literature. Two investigations of elastically tailored blades on a baseline tiltrotor are then conducted. One investigation shows that elastic <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling</b> of the rotor blade is a very effective means for increasing the flutter velocity of a tiltrotor, and the magnitude of coupling required does not have an adverse effect on performance or blade loads. The second investigation shows that passive blade twist control via elastic extension-twist coupling of the rotor blade has the capability of significantly improving tiltrotor aerodynamic performance. This concept, however, is shown to have, in general, a negative impact on stability characteristics...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} Variable angle tow {{placement}} is explored for enhancing the buckling resistance of composite plates subjected to axial compression under different plate boundary conditions. The buckling problem of VAT plate is complicated because {{of variation in}} stiffness properties across planform of the plate due to curvilinear fiber path distribution. The problem requires prebuckling analysis to be performed first to determine the non-uniform stress distribution and then the buckling analysis of VAT plates. In the present work, a solution methodology based on the Differential quadrature method (DQM) is developed for solving the partial differential equations of VAT plates with linear fiber angle orientations. Within the framework of DQM, a stress function formulation for inplane analysis and displacement formulation for buckling analysis was employed to derive the governing differential equations based on classical laminated plate theory. The novel aspect of the present work {{is the use of}} Airy’s stress function to model the prebuckling analysis of VAT plates which considerably reduces the problem size and computational effort. This approach provides more generality to handle pure stress and mixed boundary conditions more effectively when compared to the exisiting analytical models. Furthermore, the governing differential equation derived for buckling analysis of VAT panels considers the effect of <b>bending-twist</b> <b>coupling</b> terms on the buckling load. DQM was applied first to solve the inplane elasticity problem of VAT plates subjected to cosine distributed compressive loads. DQM was then extended to solve the inplane problem of VAT plates under uniform end shortening for which the unknown stress distributions are non-uniform. Stress distributions along the edges of the plate were expanded using Legendre polynomials and the unknown coefficients were determined using a least square approach such that the displacment boundary conditions are satisfied. Later, the DQM was applied to solve the buckling problem of rectangular VAT plates subjected to axial compression under different boundary conditions, viz., simply supported, clamped and free edge boundary conditions. Comparisons were made with finite element results obtained using ABAQUS and the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed DQM approach were studied...|$|R

The numerical predictions are compared with experimental measurements for a rigid and flexible composite propeller pair tested at the Naval Surface Warfare Center, Carderock Division.

40|$|Tapered {{designs are}} {{currently}} certified only for balanced and symmetric laminate construction, despite the severe design constraint that 1 angle-ply termination requires a further 3 angle-ply terminations: two terminations to maintain balanced construction and a further two terminations to maintain symmetry. This constraint is often violated in practice, leading to localised thermal warping; {{the effects of}} which {{have yet to be}} quantified. An obvious, but somewhat controversial strategy for ‘thin laminate’ designs, with traditional uni-directional (UD) material, is to adopt unbalanced and/or nonsymmetric stacking sequence configurations to fully exploit the available design space, particularly where tapered designs are a requirement. This extended design space has previously been shown to contain warp-free laminates with either fully uncoupled mechanical properties or with Extension-Shearing and/or BendingTwisting coupling behaviour. Extension-Shearing coupling, which arises in unbalanced construction, can be exploited to produce bending-twisting deformation in aircraft wing-box structures when top and bottom skins have identical bias fibre alignment, but equally, this can be eliminated with opposing bias fibre alignment. <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling,</b> which is generally present in symmetric laminate construction, results in weaker compression buckling strength compared to the equivalent fully uncoupled laminate (with matching stiffness properties), but with potentially stronger shear buckling strength. Recent studies on Extension-Shearing and Bending-Twisting coupled laminates have provided useful insight into the available design space for tapered laminates with single angle-ply or cross-ply terminations. Similar tailoring strategies are now applied to unconventional tapered laminate designs (i. e. those free from the ubiquitous symmetric and balanced, or un-balanced, design constraint) with two-ply terminations, to investigate the extent to which angleply layers can be terminated without introducing Extension-Shearing coupling, or the extent to which angle- and cross-ply combinations can be terminated to tailor or maintain Extension-Shearing throughout the tapered laminate. Consideration is also given to the potential effectiveness of introducing tailored mechanical coupling through ply terminations, e. g. to induce <b>bending-twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> in a wing-tip or winglet, using Extension-Shearing coupling at the laminate level, whilst maintaining fully uncoupled laminate behaviour in the tapered skins elsewhere in the wing-box...|$|E

The benefit of NCF material is generally associated with increased deposition rate, but this advantage may be offset by reduced design freedoms when a specific form of mechanical coupling behaviour is required, layer terminations must be introduced and/or thermal warping distortion eliminated. This article investigates the extent to which new NCF architectures can be tailored to achieve warp free tapered laminates with mechanical Extension-Shearing <b>Bending-Twisting</b> <b>coupling,</b> by single axis (longitudinal) deposition of all ply angles; thus avoiding ply discontinuities that may be introduce in large component manufacture.

The extended Galerkin method is used to obtain approximate solutions to the coupled governing equations. The effects of various anisotropic stiffness parameters on the static and dynamic stability of laminated plates are evaluated, with particular emphasis on assessing the range of applicability of classical orthotropic plate theory. It is shown that bending-extensional coupling and bending-twisting stiffness terms have a destabilizing effect on buckling and flutter, the effect being more pronounced for a small number of layers. For symmetric plates, the number of layers required for orthotropic plate theory to be applicable is generally less for the buckling problem than for flutter.

The distributions of the local mixed mode energy release rates along straight and measured curved delamination fronts have been determined by the virtual crack closure method. The dependency of computed total energy release rate and the individual mode contributions on element types and local mesh sizes is discussed.

The search space for an optimal composite structure is generally discontinuous and strongly multimodal, with the possibility for many local sub-optimal solutions or even singular extrema. These facts severely limit gradient-type approaches to optimization, bringing this broad class of problems under scrutiny for application of GAs. Examples described here of the successful use of parallel GAs to design composite structures by the authors include energy-absorbing laminated beams [1], airfoils with tailored <b>bending-twisting</b> <b>coupling</b> [2], and flywheel structures [3].
