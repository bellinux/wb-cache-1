40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{methodology}} to measure aerosol absorbing properties and mass metric quantities simultaneous {{in a single}} instrument. The laser in an OC/EC analyser, which measures organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), is {{used to measure the}} attenuation coefficient of a filter laden with aerosol. A single calibration to the Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer (MAAP), which is in our study used as a reference method, is needed to link the attenuation by aerosol on the filter to the absorption coefficient of the aerosol in ambient air. We show that the attenuation coefficient with this method can be determined within a precision of 9. 6 %. The results of an independent data set show that the results of this methodology are comparable to widely distributed commercial absorption photometers. We further demonstrate that an unstable laser transmission signal in the Sunset Thermal/Optical Carbon Analyser possibly causes a bias in the fractioning of total carbon (TC) into OC and EC. The laser transmission signal during the analysis of instrument blank filters can give an indication of the possible bias. A deviation of the laser transmission signal of 10 % leads to a substantial bias in EC content. It is therefore important to monitor the stability of the laser transmission signal during an instrument <b>blank</b> <b>analysis</b> frequently...|$|E

These methods may be conveniently classified as, (a) those in which the potability of water is determined, and (b) those by which the suitability of water for industrial purposes is determined. The potability of water is determined by its freedom from pathogenic organisms, ill smelling and bad tasting substances, while its suitability for industrial purposes is generally determined {{by the amount of}} mineral matter that is dissolved or suspended in it. This is especially true in case of steam making, paper manufacture, etc. In some industries, however, such as starch making, brewing, distilling, and ice making, the potability and the physical and chemical characteristics of water must also be considered. But the problem of industrial water is primarily a consideration of the mineral substances contained in the supplies.

40|$|The social {{diversity}} of the South African population holds considerable challenge for psychologists, especially in respect of differences in language, culture and socio-economic context. The implications of the diverse nature of expectations and needs of unique individuals, clients as well as professionals, in particular in psychological assessment, are of concern. Projected storytelling in assessment is widely recognised as valuable, especially when working with children and adolescents. The technique has its pitfalls, including the way the stories produced {{may be influenced by}} leading questions, applying different methods of interpretation, and administering the instrument in cross-cultural assessment situations. Psychologists presenting projection plates to adolescent clients in South Africa frequently obtain little more than one-liners from standard procedures, raising doubts about viability and reliability of the technique. Prompting and probing need to be enhanced without compromising the projective value of responses or the uniqueness of clients. Feuerstein pioneered mediated intervention for learners with cognitive barriers, and the dynamic assessment of culturally different children. In this study, a dynamic assessment technique of questioning (DATQ) was used to actualise projection potential in mono- and cross-cultural assessment situations. The aim of the study was two-fold: to investigate the influence of a DATQ with projection plates during the psychological assessment of adolescents, and to investigate the influence of culture on such assessment in mono- and cross-cultural situations. A qualitative, multiple case study of ten participants representing five language groups in South Africa was undertaken within a predominantly postmodern epistemology. The tension between assessment from the positivist and post-modern paradigms was acknowledged through applying different perspectives during different stages of the research. A test-training-continuation-of-test situation was created for the administration of seven projection pictures, after which two discussion protocols were used. Data-analysis and interpretation took place in four phases by way of projection analysis (using the Bellak TAT <b>Analysis</b> <b>Blank</b> and Haworth’s <b>analysis</b> of defences), structural analysis (with categories such as word-count, response pattern, formulation, number of statements, prompts, hesitations, repetitions), analysis of the participant’s experience of the Murray-method versus the dynamic assessment technique of questioning, and analysis of possible cross-cultural influences on the assessment (utilizing the Scoring Sheet for the Psychocultural Scoring System (SSPSS) and triangulating the results with the projection analysis and the thematic analysis of the conversation about culture). Findings were derived from intra-comparison (per participant) and inter-comparison (per phase of the assessment) of the analyses. The main conclusions of the study point towards participants’ projective responses increasing and deepening in the direction of self-understanding and wholesome problem solution as well as being structurally enhanced, their emotional experience of the assessment situation being positive, culturally associated values being expressed and cultural barriers to interaction being lessened in both mono- and cross-cultural assessment. Whilst projection isn’t an exclusively context-bound phenomenon and generally occurs irrespective of cultural specificity, it was found that supporting clients through non-directive prompting to voice their associations apparently didn’t interfere with the unconscious content being solicited, irrespective of the mono-/cross-cultural nature of the assessment.

40|$|A volcano-plutonic {{complex in}} the Susa area, {{southwest}} Japan, consists of the Yamashima andesites, the Koyama gabbros and syn-plutonic porphyrite dykes derived from a common basaltic andesite magma. The complex is closely associated with middle Miocene turbidite deposits. The Yamashima andesites are composed mainly of basaltic andesite feeder dykes, massive submarine lavas with hyaloclastites, and their reworked deposits. The lavas and deposits immediately overlie turbidite deposits, indicating submarine volcanic activity. The Koyama gabbros formed hornfels by contact metamorphism of the surrounding turbidites and andesites. Highly purified clinopyroxene and plagioclase mineral separates from the Yamashima andesites were dated by a K-Ar method using an ultra-low <b>blank</b> K <b>analysis</b> procedure. Ages obtained from duplicate analyses are 16. 5 ± 1. 5, 15. 2 ± 1. 4, 15. 8 ± 1. 7, and 16. 5 ± 2. 0 Ma for clinopyroxene, and 14. 2 ± 0. 8, 15. 2 ± 0. 9, and 15. 6 ± 0. 9 Ma for plagioclase. The clinopyroxene and plagioclase data define a mineral isochron age of 14. 7 ± 0. 9 (1 [sigma]) Ma with an initial 40 Ar/ 36 Ar ratio of 297. 3 ± 2. 4 (1 [sigma]), suggesting that clinopyroxene has no excess argon and can be reliably dated by K-Ar. Most of the groundmass ages are considerably younger (12. 1 - 14. 6) than the isochron age, perhaps due to argon loss during alteration. The gabbros give ages of 14. 2 ± 0. 3 and 14. 1 ± 0. 3 Ma for biotite, and 13. 7 ± 0. 3 and 13. 7 ± 0. 7 Ma for green hornblende. The porphyrite dyke yields an age of 12. 5 ± 0. 3 Ma for the groundmass, and the pelitic hornfels gives a biotite age of 14. 8 ± 0. 3 Ma.

Thereafter 8 microl of the enzyme solution were aspirated into the micro-SIA-LOV analyzer and the activity of the enzymes were evaluated by using Ellman’s reagent, i. e. 2. 5 mmol l- 1 butyrylthiocholine iodide and 0. 25 mmol 5, 5 ’-dithiobis (2 -nitrobenzoic acid). The absorbance of the coloured reaction product was measured at 412 nm after the reaction time of 60 s. The residue of the absorption liquid was washed away from the absorber and the system was washed with the enzyme solution prior to next analysis. The contaminated air caused partial inhibition of the enzyme activity of the absorption liquid. The activity of the contaminated sample was compared with the activity of the unaffected enzyme (<b>blank</b> measurement). The <b>analysis</b> was controlled by two PCs. The effect of the concentration of analyte in the absorption liquid on the enzyme activity was tested for 10 - 5 - 10 - 9 mol l- 1 sarin. A single analysis (including the absorption step) took < 130 s...|$|R
30|$|EC, pH, salinity, {{chloride}} (Cl−), fluoride (F−), and nitrate (NO 3 −) {{were analyzed}} using multiple parameters ion meter model Thermo Orion 5 Star. Sulfate (SO 42 −), phosphate (PO 43 −), and silica (SiO 2) were measured using a double beam UV–Vis spectrophotometer model Perkin Elmer Lambda 35 by turbidimetric, stannous chloride, and molybdosilicate, respectively. Sodium (Na+), potassium (K+), calcium (Ca 2 +), and magnesium (Mg 2 +) {{were analyzed using}} flame photometer model CL- 378 (Elico, India). Total hardness was determined by EDTA titrimetric method. TDS were measured gravimetrically. Total carbonate and bicarbonate alkalinities were measured by acid–base titration. The heavy metals, chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and lead (Pb) were measured using Ultima inductively coupled plasma spectrometer in the acid digested samples. The digestion was carried out with nitric/perchloric acid mixture (5 : 1). The analytical data quality was ensured through careful standardization, procedural blank measurements and duplicate samples. The ionic charge balance of each sample was within ± 5  %. The laboratory also participates in regular national program on analytical quality control. Precision and accuracy of the metal analysis data were ensured through repeated analysis (n =  11) of National Bureau of Standards No. 42 G for the metals {{and the results were}} found within ± 2  % of the certified values. Quantification of the metals was based on calibration curves of standard solution of metals (Merck, India). The precision of the analytical procedures expressed as the relative standard deviation (RSD) range from 5 to 10  %. In all the <b>analysis,</b> <b>blanks</b> were run and corrections were applied, if necessary. All observations were recorded in duplicate and average values are reported.|$|R
40|$|The aquicolous {{organism}} {{samples were}} shelled, stirred and mixed respectively. The dried samples were dried deeper, rubbed and sifted out. The treated sample was extracted by acetone thrice in ultrasonic bath, then mixed the three extracted solutions. Anhydrous Na 2 SO 4 {{was used to}} remove water in extract solution and NZ was used to concentrate the solution. The concentrated solution was transferred to Florisil column and the mixture of acetic ester and alkyl (1 / 5, v/v) was used to elute it. At last, the treated samples were analyzed qualitatively by gas chromatography-electron impact mass spectrometry (GC-EI/MS), and they were quantified by internal standard method. The conditions of pretreatment such as the selection of the extractant, the sorbent, the sorbent activation method and the eluent were optimized. The problem of controlling <b>analysis</b> <b>blank</b> was discussed. The linear correlation coefficient was higher than 0. 9999, the limit of detection was lower than 3. 7 g/L, the recovery values were in the range of 64. 1 % to 124 % and the relative standard deviation of the method was lower than 16. 4 %. This method was successfully applied to analyze seventeen kinds of phthalates of environmental incretion simultaneously in three kinds of fish(saury, snakehead, curcian), two kinds of seashell (sand snail, oyster), one shellfish (prawn), one cephalopod (octopus), two kinds of plant (kelp, seaweed) and two dried food(dried kelp, dried whitebait). Dimethyl phthalate, diisobutyl phthalate and dibutyl phthalate were determined in all samples. Diethyl phthalate and Di(2 -ethyl hexyl) phthalate were determined in many samples. It showed that these five kinds of phthalates had polluted the water in a certain extent...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which the surface {{parameters}} of Progressive Addition Lenses (PALs) affect successful patient tolerance was investigated. Several optico-physical evaluation techniques were employed, including a newly constructed surface reflection device which was shown to be of value for assessing semi-finished PAL <b>blanks.</b> Detailed physical <b>analysis</b> was undertaken using a computer-controlled focimeter and from these data, iso-cylindrical and mean spherical plots were produced for each PAL studied. Base curve power was shown to have little impact upon the distribution of PAL astigmatism. A power increase in reading addition primarily caused a lengthening and narrowing of the lens progression channel. Empirical measurements also indicated a marginal steepening of the progression power gradient with an increase in reading addition power. A sample of the PAL wearing population were studied using patient records and questionnaire analysis (90 % were returned). This subjective analysis revealed the reading portion to be the most troublesome lens zone and showed that patients with high astigmatism (> 2. 00 D) adapt more readily to PALs than those with spherical or low cylindrical (2. 00 D) corrections. The psychophysical features of PALs were then investigated. Both grafting visual acuity (VA) and contrast sensitivity (CS) were shown to be reduced with an increase in eccentricity from the central umbilical line. Two sample populations (N= 20) of successful and unsuccessful PAL wearers were assessed for differences in their visual performance and their adaptation to optically induced distortion. The possibility of dispensing errors being the cause of poor patient tolerance amongst the unsuccessful wearer group was investigated and discounted. The contrast sensitivity of the successful group was significantly greater than that of the unsuccessful group. No differences in adaptation to or detection of curvature distortion were evinced between these presbyopic groups...|$|R
30|$|Separation and {{analysis}} of volatile compounds was done using HS-SPME coupled with GC-MS (Varian 430 -GC and 210 -MS, Japan) with a factor four capillary column VF 5 -MS (30  m[*]×[*] 0.25  mm[*]×[*] 0.25  μm) (Varian, Inc., Palo Alto, CA) of 5  % diphenyl, 95  % dimethyl polysilosane. The research grade helium (99.999  %) {{was used as the}} carrier gas under a constant flow of 28.6  cm/s (1  ml/min). Volatiles were extracted and concentrated by using preconditioned SPME fiber at 250  °C for 30  min attached to the SPME manual holder (57330 -U) (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA, USA). The SPME fiber was desorbed for 5  min in GC injector having temperature at 260  °C. Optimum performance of SPME fiber was monitored after every ten extractions with the standard fiber maintained separately. The fiber showing comparable performance was continued in further <b>analysis.</b> <b>Blanks</b> were run following every fourth sample as a control. The GC oven program was optimized for the separation of 2 AP from seed and leaf samples. Initially, oven temperature was kept at 45  °C for 1  min and ramped to 55  °C at the rate 5  °C/min, then at the rate of 9  °C/min up to 120  °C, further ramped to 240  °C at the rate 15  °C/min with final hold of 1  min. The total GC cycles consisted of 19.22  min runs and 1  min re-stabilization time. Blank run of GC-MS was also performed after every sixth samples to remove traces (if any) from earlier runsin GC column. The injector temperature was 260  °C and the transfer line was held at 230  °C. The detection was performed by a Saturn III mass spectrometer in the EI mode (ionization energy, 70  eV; source temperature, 180  °C). The MS was operated in the scan mode from m/z 35 to 275. Identification and quantification of 2 AP and other volatiles were done at selected seven developmental stages as described previously (Hinge et al. 2016). The comparative GC-chromatograms for three rice cultivars at seven developmental stages are shown in Additional file 3 : Figure S 1. During the analysis, 14 volatile compounds were identified as odor active compounds (OACs) that were analyzed quantitatively in the seven developmental stages in all three rice cultivars. This includes 2 AP, 8 aliphatic aldehydes (pentanal, hexanal, heptanal, octanal, (2 E)- 2 -nonenal, nonanal, decanal and (E)- 2 -octenal), 1 aromatic aldehyde (phenylacetaldehyde), 2 alcohols (1 -octanol and 1 -octen- 3 -ol), 1 furan (2 -pentylfuran), and 1 ketone (E)- 3 -octen- 2 -one).|$|R
