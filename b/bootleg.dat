5|$|Live'r Than You'll Ever Be is a <b>bootleg</b> {{recording}} of the Rolling Stones' concert in Oakland, California, from 9 November 1969. It {{was one of the}} first live rock music bootlegs and was made notorious as a document of their 1969 tour of the United States. The popularity of the <b>bootleg</b> forced the Stones' label Decca Records to release the live album Get Yer Ya-Yas Out! The Rolling Stones in Concert in 1970. Live'r is also one of the earliest commercial <b>bootleg</b> recordings in rock history, released in December 1969, just two months after the Beatles' Kum Back and five months after Bob Dylan's Great White Wonder. Like the two earlier records, Live'rs outer sleeve is plain white, with its name stamped on in ink.|$|E
5|$|Several reviewers have {{likened the}} album to a <b>bootleg.</b> Neither Wheeler nor Parallel World {{provided}} {{any information about}} the artists or names of the tracks. When re-issued in 2003, reviewer Mack Hagood criticized Parallel World for reifying its <b>bootleg</b> status by retaining the anonymous track list rather than working to look for surviving artists or their families, who would likely benefit greatly from royalties. With information more widely available on the Internet {{and the opportunity to}} collaborate, all tracks have since been identified.|$|E
5000|$|Most of Pink Floyd's early <b>bootlegs</b> concern {{performances}} {{from the}} European A Saucerful of Secrets Tour and the A Saucerful of Secrets US Tour. Most of these <b>bootlegs</b> were {{released by the}} label [...] "Ace <b>Bootlegs</b> Production".|$|R
25|$|The band elected not {{to release}} {{official}} <b>bootlegs</b> for its 2007 European Tour. Official <b>bootlegs</b> {{are available for}} the band's 2008 U.S. Tour through the band's official website in FLAC, MP3, and CD formats. The 2008 <b>bootlegs</b> were released through Kufala Recordings.|$|R
50|$|At least 34 <b>bootlegs</b> of {{different}} concerts from 1971 were released (not counting the several <b>bootlegs</b> of each concert).|$|R

5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen to stress that the markets for <b>bootleg</b> and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a <b>bootleg</b> will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, a {{virtually}} complete collection {{of all of}} Dylan's 1967 recordings in Woodstock was released on a <b>bootleg</b> five-CD set, The Genuine Basement Tapes. The collection, which contains over 100 songs and alternate takes, was later remastered and issued as the four-CD <b>bootleg</b> A Tree With Roots. On November 4, 2014, Columbia/Legacy issued , an official 6-CD box set containing 139 tracks which comprises nearly all of Dylan's basement recordings, including 30 never-bootlegged tracks. A companion 2-CD set containing highlights from the recordings, The Basement Tapes Raw, was also released.|$|E
5000|$|Girly-Sound is {{the name}} under which singer-songwriter Liz Phair {{recorded}} several self-produced cassettes in 1991. The cassettes were later made available as <b>bootlegs</b> and some tracks have been officially released. Girly-Sound is also the name {{used to refer to}} the demos or <b>bootlegs</b> collectively. The recordings have been called [...] "legendary" [...] by Spin Magazine and by AllMusic [...] "one of the most popular and sought-after alternative rock <b>bootlegs</b> of all time".|$|R
50|$|Boot Yer Butt!: The Doors <b>Bootlegs</b> is a four-disc box set {{released}} by Rhino/Elektra Records {{for the band}} The Doors, featuring songs that were recorded as <b>bootlegs</b> during concerts of The Doors ranging from the years 1967 to 1970.|$|R

5|$|The {{late 1990s}} saw an {{increase}} in the free trading of digital bootlegs, sharply decreasing the demand for and profitability of physical bootlegs. The rise of audio file formats such as MP3 and Real Audio, combined with the ability to share files between computers via the internet made it simpler for <b>bootleg</b> collectors to exchange recordings. The arrival of Napster in 1999 made it easy to share bootlegs between a large computer network. Older analog recordings were converted to digital format, tracks from <b>bootleg</b> CDs were ripped to computer hard disks, and new material was created with digital recording of various types, and all of these types could now be easily shared. Instead of album-length collections or live recordings of entire shows, fans often now had the option of searching for and downloading bootlegs of individual songs. Artists gave a mixed reaction to <b>bootleg</b> sharing via the internet; Bob Dylan allowed fans to download archive recordings from his official website, while King Crimson's Robert Fripp and, infamously, Metallica were strongly critical of the ease in which Napster could circumvent the traditional channels of royalty payments.|$|E
5|$|After its release, Inchon {{was never}} again shown in theaters, {{and was never}} {{released}} on videocassette or DVD. It did however air on U.S. cable television outlet Goodlife Television Network (now called Youtoo America), at the time owned by the Unification Church. <b>Bootleg</b> copies of the film circulated from individuals that had copied Inchon from these television broadcasts.|$|E
50|$|Nearly {{one month}} after the release of the movie, high quality <b>bootlegs</b> of the movie were being sold in Iran, even though the movie was still playing in cinemas. Dehnamaki accused Hamshahri {{newspaper}} employees of being responsible for the release of the <b>bootlegs.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Bootlegging</b> -the {{unauthorised}} projects {{initiated by}} an employee and directed toward innovation {{for the benefit}} of their organization -is an important aspect of innovation, because it {{is considered to be a}} great source of bottom-up innovation within organisations. Since it is clandestine and hidden from management and researchers, it has remained one of the least researched aspects of the innovation process. There are a handful of studies on the topic of <b>bootlegging</b> in the management literature – mainly based on one or a small number of case studies. The research suggests that <b>bootlegging</b> activity can lead to innovative new products and is seen in a positive light by a large majority of authors. However, the existing literature lacks empirical evidence and consensus among different authors on the various aspects of <b>bootlegging</b> such as reasons for <b>bootlegging,</b> underground operation, disclosure stage of <b>bootlegging</b> and its outcomes. Since <b>bootlegging</b> is a clandestine process, after careful consideration of a variety options, it was concluded that in-depth interviews with bootleggers is the most appropriate approach for studying the topic. Network sampling was applied to identify bootleggers and gain their trust. The researcher has utilised his network and attended several professional and engineering conferences to identify and approach bootleggers rather than contacting them through their managers and organisations. Subsequently, 55 in-depth semi-structured interviews were undertaken. The appropriate research methodology helped to shed light on these under-researched aspects of innovation. Cont/d...|$|R
5|$|Besides {{appearing}} on Highway 61 Revisited, the song's standard release {{can be found}} on the compilations Bob Dylan's Greatest Hits, Biograph, The Best of Bob Dylan (1997), The Essential Bob Dylan, The Best of Bob Dylan (2005), and Dylan. The mono version appears on The Original Mono Recordings. In addition, the early, incomplete studio recording in 3/4 time appears on The <b>Bootleg</b> Series Vol. 2.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bootleg</b> {{collectors}} in {{this era}} generally relied on Hot Wacks, an annual underground magazine listing known bootlegs and information about recent releases. It provided the true information on bootlegs with fictitious labels, and included details on artists and track listings, {{as well as the}} source and sound quality of the various recordings.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the live albums Live on Two Legs, Live at Benaroya Hall, Live in NYC 12/31/92, Live at Easy Street, Live at the Gorge 05/06, Live at Lollapalooza 2007, Live on Ten Legs and myriad live versions of studio songs spread across singles as B-sides, the band has released an official bootlegs series of live recordings for each show of each tour since its 2000 European tour, {{with the exception of}} the 2004 Vote for Change tour and its 2007 European tour. The band has sold more than 3.5 millioncopies of shows since launching the <b>bootleg</b> series in 2000. For its 2000 and 2003 tours the bootlegs consisted of double-disc (and sometimes triple-disc) albums. The <b>bootleg</b> series switched over to MP3 format for the band's 2005 shows and expanded to include lossless FLAC format for its 2006 tour. Official bootlegs are available for the band's 2008 United States Tour and 2009 North American Tour in FLAC, MP3, and CD formats.|$|E
50|$|In January 1972, Pink Floyd debuted {{the live}} {{performance}} of their album The Dark Side of the Moon before its release. A lot of Pink Floyd <b>bootlegs</b> date back from this period. Most of these <b>bootlegs</b> contain a pre-release version of the whole album.|$|R
5000|$|William [...] "Dint" [...] Colbeck [...] (November 17, 1890 - February 17, 1943) was a St. Louis {{politician}} and organized crime figure involved in <b>bootlegging</b> and illegal gambling. He succeeded William Egan {{as head of}} the Egan's Rats <b>bootlegging</b> gang in the early 1920s.|$|R
25|$|Pearl Jam took {{a year-long}} touring break until the 2004 Vote for Change tour, but the band elected not to release <b>bootlegs</b> {{for the six}} shows from that tour. The band took yet another year off until a fall 2005 tour of Canada and South America. For the first time, the <b>bootlegs</b> were MP3-only, again only {{available}} through the band's official website. The music downloads were accompanied by pictures from individual shows. The MP3-only format expanded to include lossless FLAC format for the band's 2006 summer tour for its self-titled eighth album. The digital <b>bootlegs</b> were typically made available within 2–3 days of each show date. The <b>bootlegs</b> were available through the band's official download website, which has since been discontinued.|$|R
5|$|In the mid-1970s, a <b>bootleg</b> {{containing}} rare {{singles and}} B-sides entitled The Dark Side of the Moo appeared, {{with a similar}} cover. Like Atom Heart Mother, the cover had no writing on it, although {{in this case it}} was to protect the bootlegger's anonymity rather than any artistic statement. The album cover to The KLF's concept album Chill Out was also inspired by Atom Heart Mother.|$|E
5|$|OCD International {{was created}} as an imprint of CMH {{to release the}} material. On October 12, 2004, a <b>bootleg</b> {{consisting}} of material produced by Chilly Chill from the Lench Mob was released under the title Dr. Octagon Part 2 by Real Talk Records. It was discontinued by court order.|$|E
5|$|Presley himself {{disapproved of}} the album, {{and it was}} later {{withdrawn}} at his request. Despite this, Having Fun with Elvis on Stage reached number 130 on the Billboard 200, peaked at number 9 on the Billboard Hot Country LPs, and spawned <b>bootleg</b> copies along with a fan-made sequel.|$|E
5|$|The {{tightening}} {{of laws and}} increased enforcement by police {{on behalf of the}} British Phonographic Industry (BPI), Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and other industry groups—often for peripheral issues such as tax evasion—gradually drove the distributors of for-profit vinyl and CD <b>bootlegs</b> further underground. Physical <b>bootlegging</b> largely shifted to countries with laxer copyright laws with the results distributed through existing underground channels, open market sites such as eBay, and other specialised websites, though {{by the end of the}} decade, eBay had clamped down on <b>bootlegs.</b>|$|R
50|$|An {{investigation}} by the New York State Governor's office reported that the New York Five Families <b>bootlegging</b> scheme avoided taxes on {{one out of every}} ten gallons of gasoline brought into the metropolitan area. The report stated that gasoline <b>bootlegging</b> had become the mob's most profitable scheme.|$|R
50|$|There are no {{official}} charts or certifications {{due to the}} loose nature of the business and <b>bootlegging.</b> Ringtone charts are occasionally made, but due to <b>bootlegging,</b> they are also highly inaccurate. There are several awards in different countries awarded in different ways according to their organizations.|$|R
5|$|The 1980s saw the {{increased}} use of audio cassettes and videotapes for the dissemination of <b>bootleg</b> recordings, as the affordability of private dubbing equipment made the production of multiple copies significantly easier. Cassettes were also smaller, easier to ship, and could be sold or traded more affordably than vinyl. Cassette culture and tape trading, propelled by the DIY ethic of the punk subculture, relied on an honour system where people who received tapes from fellow traders made multiple copies to pass on to others within the community. For a while, stalls at major music gatherings such as the Glastonbury Festival sold mass copies of <b>bootleg</b> soundboard recordings of bands who, in many cases, had played only a matter of hours beforehand. However, officials soon began to counteract this illegal activity by making raids on the stalls and, {{by the end of the}} 1980s, the number of festival bootlegs had consequently dwindled.|$|E
5|$|The known outtakes {{from the}} Freewheelin album are as follows. All songs {{released}} in 1991 on The <b>Bootleg</b> Series 1–3 {{are discussed in}} that album's liner notes, while songs {{that have never been}} released have been documented by biographer Clinton Heylin, except where noted. All songs written by Bob Dylan, except where noted.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} type is the live <b>bootleg,</b> or {{audience}} recording, which is created with sound recording equipment smuggled into a live concert. Many artists and live venues prohibit this form of recording, but from the 1970s onwards the increased availability of portable technology made such bootlegging easier, and the general quality of these recordings has improved over time as consumer equipment becomes sophisticated. A number of bootlegs originated with FM radio broadcasts of live or previously recorded live performances. Other bootlegs may be soundboard recordings taken directly from a multi-track mixing console used to feed the public address system at a live performance. Artists may record their own shows for private review, but engineers may surreptitiously take a copy of this, which ends up being shared. As a soundboard recording is intended to supplement the natural acoustics of a gig, a <b>bootleg</b> may have an inappropriate mix of instruments, unless the gig is so large that everything needs to be amplified {{and sent to the}} desk.|$|E
