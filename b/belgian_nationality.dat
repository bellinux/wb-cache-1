25|$|People {{of foreign}} origin make up nearly 70% of the {{population}} of Brussels, most of whom have been naturalized following the great 1991 reform of the naturalization process. About 32% of city residents are of non-Belgian European origin, and 36% are of another background, mostly from Morocco, Turkey and Sub-Saharan Africa. Among all major migrant groups from outside the EU, a majority of the permanent residents have acquired <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality.</b>|$|E
25|$|Article 5 of the 1831 Belgian Constitution made a {{difference}} between ordinary naturalization, and grande naturalisation. Only (former) foreigners who had been granted grande naturalisation were entitled to vote, {{be a candidate for}} parliamentary elections, or be appointed minister. However, ordinary naturalized citizens could vote for municipal elections. Ordinary naturalized citizens and citizens who had acquired <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality</b> through marriage could vote, but not run as candidates for parliamentary elections in 1976. The concepts of ordinary and grande naturalization were suppressed from the Constitution in 1991.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of 2012, people of foreign background and their descendants were estimated to have formed around 25% {{of the total population}} i.e. 2.8million new Belgians. Of these new Belgians, 1,200,000 are of European ancestry and 1,350,000 are from non-Western countries (most of them from Morocco, Turkey, and the DR Congo). Since the modification of the <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality</b> law in 1984 more than 1.3million migrants have acquired Belgian citizenship. The largest group of immigrants and their descendants in Belgium are Moroccans. 89.2% of inhabitants of Turkish origin have been naturalized, as have 88.4% of people of Moroccan background, 75.4% of Italians, 56.2% of the French and 47.8% of Dutch people.|$|E
40|$|This book {{analyzes}} {{issues in}} human rights law {{from a variety of}} perspectives by eminent European and Asian professors of constitutional law, international public law, and European Union law. As a result, their contributions collected here illustrate the phenomenon of cross-fertilization not only in Europe (the EU and its member states and the Council of Europe), but also between Europe and Asia. Furthermore, it reveals the influence that national and foreign law, EU law and the European Convention on Human Rights, and European and Asian law exert over one another. The various chapters cover general fundamental rights and human rights issues in Europe and Asia as well as specific topics regarding the principles of nondiscrimination, women’s rights, the right to freedom of speech in Japan, and China’s Development Banks in Asia. Protection of human rights should be guaranteed in the international community, and research based on a comparative law approach is useful for the protection of human rights at a higher level. As the product of academic cooperation between ten professors of Japanese, Taiwanese, German, Italian, and <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationalities,</b> this work responds to such needs...|$|R

He held dual <b>Belgian</b> and Moroccan <b>nationality.</b> His father, a retired butcher and devout Muslim, emigrated from Morocco; his mother was described as [...] "conservative and reclusive". His brother Khalid {{has been identified as}} the suicide bomber at Maalbeek metro station in Brussels on 22 March 2016.|$|R
5000|$|Belgium has {{the second}} highest density highway network in Europe after the Netherlands, at 54.7 km per 1000 km². Most Belgian {{highways}} have three lanes {{with a few exceptions}} like the ring roads around Brussels and Antwerp which have five or six lanes in some stretches. Belgium is situated at a crossroads of several different countries, and its highways are used by people of many <b>nationalities.</b> <b>Belgian</b> highways are indicated by the letter [...] "A" [...] and a European number, with E numbers being used most often. Roads that are (part of) a ring road around a city or a town are usually indicated by an R number. Many of the highways in Belgium are illuminated at night, since there is a surplus of nuclear-powered electricity during off-peak hours.|$|R
25|$|Gropius's career {{advanced}} {{in the postwar}} period. Henry van de Velde, {{the master of the}} Grand-Ducal Saxon School of Arts and Crafts in Weimar was asked to step down in 1915 due to his <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality.</b> His recommendation for Gropius to succeed him led eventually to Gropius's appointment as master of the school in 1919. It was this academy which Gropius transformed into the world-famous Bauhaus, attracting a faculty that included Paul Klee, Johannes Itten, Josef Albers, Herbert Bayer, László Moholy-Nagy, Otto Bartning and Wassily Kandinsky. In principle, the Bauhaus represented an opportunity to extend beauty and quality to every home through well designed industrially produced objects. The Bauhaus program was experimental and the emphasis, was theoretical. One example product of the Bauhaus was the armchair F 51, designed for the Bauhaus's directors room in 1920 – nowadays a re-edition in the market, manufactured by the German company TECTA/Lauenfoerde.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{disclosed}} that Arnault planned {{to apply for}} Belgian citizenship and was considering moving to Belgium in 2013. In April 2013, Arnault {{said that he had}} been misquoted and that he never intended to leave France: [...] "I repeatedly said that I would stay as a resident in France and that I would continue to pay my taxes.... Today, I decided to remove any ambiguity. I withdraw my request of <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality.</b> Requesting <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality</b> was to better protect the foundation that I created with the sole purpose of ensuring the continuity and integrity of the LVMH group if I were to disappear." [...] On 10 April 2013, Arnault announced that he had decided to abandon his application for Belgian citizenship, saying he did not want the move to be misinterpreted as a measure of tax evasion at a time when France faced economic and social challenges. Arnault also stated that several employees requested to leave France for tax purposes, that he declined their requests, and that [...] "the 75% tax would not raise a lot of revenue but should prove less divisive now that it was set to be levied on firms rather than people and only due to stay in place for two years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Unlike {{the models}} {{mentioned}} above, Christie's Poirot {{was clearly the}} result of her early development of the detective in her first book, written in 1916 and published in 1920. His <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality</b> was interesting because of Belgium's occupation by Germany, which also provided a plausible explanation of why such a skilled detective {{would be out of}} work and available to solve mysteries at an English country house. At the time of Christie's writing, it was considered patriotic to express sympathy towards the Belgians, since the invasion of their country had constituted Britain's casus belli for entering World War I, and British wartime propaganda emphasised the [...] "Rape of Belgium".|$|E
25|$|The 1st Brigade was {{in reserve}} around noon but was sent into the {{fighting}} about 3:30 pm with the 1st Carabiniers leading. Because the 5th Light Dragoons were roughly handled by French Chasseurs à Cheval at the Battle of Quatre Bras on 16 June, {{they were held}} in reserve on 18 June. Recruited in November 1814, the 8th Hussar Regiment under Louis Duvivier {{was made up of}} raw soldiers of French, <b>Belgian</b> and German <b>nationalities.</b> During the struggle at Waterloo, the 8th found itself face-to-face with the elite French Guard Horse Grenadiers. After an order given in Dutch threw the 8th Hussars into confusion, they were charged and put to flight by the Horse Grenadiers. Enough troopers rallied to form a single squadron which cooperated with the brigades of Hussey Vivian and John Ormsby Vandeleur later in the afternoon.|$|R
2500|$|If {{a person}} already lost Dutch {{nationality}} under these three exceptions prior to 1 April 2003, the final date to regain Dutch nationality under these three exceptions was 1 April 2013. Since then, {{it is no}} longer to reacquire Dutch nationality by option under these three exceptions if the person had already lost Dutch nationality prior to 1 April 2003. The only way to regain Dutch nationality is by naturalization. These exemptions do not apply in the case of acquisition of Austrian, Norwegian or Danish citizenship. Before 28 April 2008, those exemptions did not apply to obtaining <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality.</b> Before 10 July 2009, these exemptions did not apply to getting the Luxembourgian nationality. This is due to the provisions of the Convention on the Reduction of Cases of Multiple Nationality, to which the Netherlands became party in 1985.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{creating}} rights for [...] "workers" [...] who generally lack bargaining {{power in the}} market, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the [...] "freedom of establishment" [...] in article 49, and [...] "freedom to provide services" [...] in article 56. In Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be [...] "established" [...] means to participate in economic life [...] "on a stable and continuous basis", while providing [...] "services" [...] meant pursuing activity more [...] "on a temporary basis". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, should claim for breach of establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, [...] "justified by imperative requirements in the general interest" [...] and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or [...] "undertakings" [...] such as companies or firms, {{have a right to}} set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder freedom of establishment, so article 49 has both [...] "vertical" [...] and [...] "horizontal" [...] direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked <b>Belgian</b> <b>nationality</b> was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' freedom of establishment when they exercise [...] "official authority". But regulation of an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market. Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement freedom of establishment that needed to be justified.|$|E
