Several sets of comparative measurements were made with each type of machine on both grassland and arable land (mostly cereal stubbles), covering a range of soil, crop and weather conditions. Measurements of NH 3 emissions were made for 5 – 7 days following application using a micrometeorological mass balance technique. Mean reductions in NH 3 emission achieved from grassland, in comparison with surface broadcast application, were 73, 57 and 26 % for shallow injection, {{trailing shoe}} and <b>band</b> <b>spreading,</b> respectively, the latter not being significant (probability P> 005).

The {{objective of this}} thesis was to determine appropriate techniques for slurry injection into ley that would minimise ammonia emissions, contamination of crops and energy inputs, while resulting in high plant utilisation of slurry nitrogen. Slurry injector performance was validated in field trials. Conventional slurry tankers with different types of injectors were used to shallow-inject (less than 0. 05 m) slurry into open slots after the first cut.

40|$|International audienceLand {{application}} of manures and slurries {{are a major}} source of pollution such as water contamination by nitrates and greenhouse gas emissions. NH 3 and N 2 O emissions can be lowered by suitable spreading techniques. However, a comprehensive review of the impact of slurry spreading techniques is lacking. For that we developed a model, named OSEEP, that simulates the effect of slurry incorporation, slurry spatial distribution, and soil compaction on NH 3 and N 2 O emissions. OSEEP integrates a soil compaction model, a hydraulic pedotransfer function, a NH 3 volatilization model, and a crop model. We ran OSEEP for five sites in France for 7  years. Four techniques were simulated: broadcast <b>spreading,</b> <b>band</b> <b>spreading,</b> incorporation after surface spreading, and injection. We tested various sizes of slurry tankers and tractors. We calculated NH 3 and N 2 O relative emissions from various spreading techniques with respect to <b>band</b> <b>spreading.</b> Results show good agreement between model calculation and published field data. We found that slurry applied by a self-propelled 15 -m 3 tanker with extra large tires led to an increase of 20  % in N 2 O emission, by comparison with a 15 -m 3 tanker trailed by a tractor. Hence, we show that soil compaction should be taken into account to optimize trade-offs between NH 3 and N 2 O emissions...|$|R

40|$|LCAs (life cycle assessments) {{are often}} based on average data to produce a generic {{evaluation}} of a good or service. However, ignoring variability and induced uncertainty of LCA results reduces their significance, especially when dealing with agricultural processes that present high natural fluctuations. The objective {{of the study was}} to explore the robustness of LCA results when accounting for variable emissions data, illustrated by the case of slurry application techniques. Four application techniques were compared: <b>band</b> <b>spreading,</b> broadcast spreading, harrowing after surface application and direct injection. On the basis of the normalisation results, acidification, eutrophication and global warming potentials were selected. To estimate field nitrogen emissions, an original approach was developed based on relative nitrogen loss factors for each technique from a literature review. The calculated field emissions from different soil and climate conditions were considered equally probable and were propagated into a range of LCA result using the Monte Carlo method. Injection and harrowing both showed reduced acidification and eutrophication potentials compared to <b>band</b> <b>spreading</b> and broadcast spreading but had larger global warming potentials, which could be particularly important with injection. Harrowing consequently appeared as the best compromise. Despite the large range of LCA results, robust conclusions could be drawn. To achieve a more refined comparison between the techniques, the use of processbased models in contrasted situations is suggested. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

The Prairie View Co-eds were even able to perform at USO shows. Their performance marked a success for black military personnel who were often excluded from the entertainment white soldiers received.

In full-scale experiments the placements of the slurry as well as ammonia emissions and yields were measured after injection in open slots with three techniques: pressurised injec-tion (PI), shallow injection with V-shaped discs (SIO 1), and shallow injection with two angled discs (SIO 2). The performance between the injectors varied and only the SIO 2 was able to place the slurry in ley below soil surface on all three soil types. The ammonia release was on average halved after injection with SIO 2 compared to <b>band</b> <b>spreading,</b> however there was an average loss of 19 kg N ha- 1. A tine for shallow injection in closed slots (tubulator) was therefore developed. In small scale with single tines, the tubulator was compared to SIO 2 with regards to slurry placement, ammonia emissions and draught requirements. Ammonia losses after injection with the tubulator tine were only 1. 6 % of the total applied ammoniacal nitrogen (TAN) compared to 27 % with the SIO 2. The draught requirement for the tubulator was roughly the same, or a little higher than the SIO 2 tine. In the full-scale experiments, the reduced loss of ammonia nitrogen with SIO 2 did not result in higher DM yield or higher nitrogen efficiency of the second cut as compared to <b>band</b> <b>spreading...</b>|$|R
