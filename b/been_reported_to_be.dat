5|$|Gram {{quantities}} of various copper salts {{have been taken}} in suicide attempts and produced acute copper toxicity in humans, possibly due to redox cycling and the generation of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA. Corresponding amounts of copper salts (30mg/kg) are toxic in animals. A minimum dietary value for healthy growth in rabbits has <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> at least 3 ppm in the diet.

5|$|A {{country that}} had <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a likely early export {{customer}} for the modernized Su-35 was Venezuela. The Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez in July 2006 placed an order for 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from 2006 to 2008. The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the same type, or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government {{were interested in the}} aircraft and had placed an order for the Su-35, the country was negotiating with Russia in 2016 for the Su-30 aircraft instead.|$|E
5|$|Boletus caucasicus, {{found in}} {{southern}} Europe, has yellow flesh in the cap tissue immediately above the tube layer, {{in contrast to}} the reddish colour of the same flesh found in S.luridus. Another European species, Rubroboletus rhodoxanthus, has characteristic pinkish tones in the cap. The Chinese species Neoboletus sinensis, originally described as a form of S.luridus, can be most reliably distinguished from the latter by its larger spores, which have <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> as large as 12–17 by 5.5–7μm. Fruit bodies closely resembling S.luridus have been recorded in Australia, though renamed Boletus barragensis as they differ in spore size and preference for trees of the family Myrtaceae.|$|E
5|$|Footdrumming is used widely as a {{predator}} warning or defensive action. It is used primarily by fossorial or semi-fossorial rodents. The banner-tailed kangaroo rat produces several complex footdrumming patterns {{in a number}} of different contexts, one of which is when it encounters a snake. The footdrumming may alert nearby offspring but most likely conveys that the rat is too alert for a successful attack, thus preventing the snake's predatory pursuit. Several studies have indicated intentional use of ground vibrations as a means of intra-specific communication during courtship among the Cape mole rat. Footdrumming has <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in male-male competition; the dominant male indicates its resource holding potential by drumming, thus minimizing physical contact with potential rivals.|$|E

5|$|In September 2014, it was {{reported}} that Gröning had been charged by state prosecutors with having been an accessory to murder for his role at Auschwitz receiving and processing prisoners and their personal belongings. The indictment stated that Gröning economically advanced Nazi Germany and aided the systematic killing of 300,000 of the 425,000 Hungarian Jews who were deported to Auschwitz by 137 railway transports during the summer of 1944. Gröning's prosecution has <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a part of Germany’s final effort to bring the last Nazi war-crimes suspects to justice. State prosecutors managed to charge the defendant on a legal precedent set in 2011 by the conviction of the former Sobibor extermination camp guard John Demjanjuk by a court in Munich.|$|E
5|$|Locomotor {{behavior}} in lemurs, both living and extinct, is highly varied and its diversity exceeds that of anthropoids. Locomotor postures and behaviors have included vertical clinging and leaping (including saltatory behavior), seen in indriids and bamboo lemurs; slow (loris-like) arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by Mesopropithecus; fast arboreal quadrupedal locomotion, seen in true lemurs and ruffed lemurs; partially terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, {{seen in the}} ring-tailed lemur; highly terrestrial quadrupedal locomotion, once exhibited by monkey lemurs such as Hadropithecus; and sloth-like suspensory locomotion, once exhibited {{by many of the}} sloth lemurs, such as Palaeopropithecus. The Lac Alaotra gentle lemur (Hapalemur alaotrensis) has even <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a good swimmer. Sometimes these locomotor types are lumped together into two main groups of lemurs, the vertical clingers and leapers and the arboreal (and occasionally terrestrial) quadrupeds.|$|E
5|$|No {{definitive}} antidote is available, {{but some}} specific treatments {{have been shown}} to improve survivability. High-dose continuous intravenous penicillin G has <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> of benefit, though the exact mechanism is unknown, and trials with cephalosporins show promise. Some evidence indicates intravenous silibinin, an extract from the blessed milk thistle (Silybum marianum), may be beneficial in reducing the effects of death cap poisoning. A long-term clinical trial of intravenous silibinin began in the US in 2010. Silibinin prevents the uptake of amatoxins by liver cells, thereby protecting undamaged liver tissue; it also stimulates DNA-dependent RNA polymerases, leading to an increase in RNA synthesis. According to one report based on a treatment of 60 patients with silibinin, patients who started the drug within 96 hours of ingesting the mushroom and who still had intact kidney function all survived. As of February 2014 supporting research has not yet been published.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect of}} lead on children's {{cognitive}} abilities {{takes place at}} very low levels. There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship (unlike other heavy metals such as mercury). Reduced academic performance {{has been associated with}} lead exposure even at blood lead levels lower than 5μg/dL. Blood lead levels below 10μg/dL have <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression, in proportion with blood lead levels. Between the blood lead levels of 5 and 35μg/dL, an IQ decrease of 2–4 points for each μg/dL increase is reported in children. However, studies that show associations between low-level lead exposure and health effects in children may be affected by confounding and overestimate the effects of low-level lead exposure.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid nodules {{have been}} {{associated}} with the Birt–Hogg–Dubé phenotype, present in 65% of individuals and 90% of families with the syndrome.

5|$|A German mutant with {{a strong}} Catholic faith and the {{appearance}} of a blue demon. Nightcrawler was used by Stryker in an assassination attempt on the President of the United States and gives help to the X-Men. He is capable of teleporting himself (and others) instantly from one location to another. Nightcrawler can teleport through walls, but prefers to only teleport when he can see his landing site. On his body are many scarification marks, one for every sin. Cumming had always been Singer's choice for the role, but at first he was not available due to scheduling conflicts. At some point, Ethan Embry had <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in contention for the role. Ultimately, the film remained in development long enough for Cumming to accept the part. Singer also felt comfortable in casting him since he speaks German fluently. The drawings of Adam Kubert were used as inspiration for Nightcrawler's makeup design, which took four hours to apply. For the scene where Nightcrawler has his shirt off, Cumming went through nine hours of makeup. To best pose as Nightcrawler, Cumming studied comic books and illustrations of the character.|$|E

5|$|Inability {{to secure}} the airway, with {{subsequent}} failure of oxygenation and ventilation is a life-threatening complication which if not immediately corrected leads to decreased oxygen content, brain damage, cardiovascular collapse, and death. When performed improperly, the associated complications (e.g., unrecognized esophageal intubation) may be rapidly fatal. Without adequate training and experience, the incidence of such complications is high. The case of Andrew Davis Hughes, from Emerald Isle, NC is a widely known {{case in which the}} patient was improperly intubated and, {{due to the lack of}} oxygen, suffered severe brain damage and died. For example, among paramedics in several United States urban communities, unrecognized esophageal or hypopharyngeal intubation has <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> 6% to 25%. Although not common, where basic emergency medical technicians are permitted to intubate, reported success rates are as low as 51%. In one study, nearly half of patients with misplaced tracheal tubes died in the emergency room. Because of this, recent editions of the American Heart Association's Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation have de-emphasized the role of tracheal intubation in favor of other airway management techniques such as bag-valve-mask ventilation, the laryngeal mask airway and the Combitube.|$|E
5|$|Deficits in {{cognitive}} abilities are {{widely recognized as}} a core feature of schizophrenia. The extent of the cognitive deficits an individual experiences is a predictor of how functional an individual will be, the quality of occupational performance, and how successful the individual will be in maintaining treatment. The presence and degree of cognitive dysfunction in individuals with schizophrenia has <b>been</b> <b>reported</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a better indicator of functionality than the presentation of positive or negative symptoms. The deficits impacting the cognitive function are found in {{a large number of}} areas: working memory, long-term memory, verbal declarative memory, semantic processing, episodic memory, attention, learning (particularly verbal learning). Deficits in verbal memory are the most pronounced in individuals with schizophrenia, and are not accounted for by deficit in attention. Verbal memory impairment has been linked to a decreased ability in individuals with schizophrenia to semantically encode (process information relating to meaning), which is cited as a cause for another known deficit in long-term memory. When given a list of words, healthy individuals remember positive words more frequently (known as the Pollyanna principle); however, individuals with schizophrenia tend to remember all words equally regardless of their connotations, suggesting that the experience of anhedonia impairs the semantic encoding of the words. These deficits have been found in individuals before the onset of the illness to some extent. First-degree family members of individuals with schizophrenia and other high-risk individuals also show a degree of deficit {{in cognitive}} abilities, and specifically in working memory.A review of the literature on cognitive deficits in individuals with schizophrenia shows that the deficits may be present in early adolescence, or as early as childhood. The deficits which an individual with schizophrenia presents tend to remain the same over time in most patients, or follow an identifiable course based upon environmental variables.|$|E
