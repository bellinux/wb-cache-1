40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMany materials processing operations {{such as age}} hardening heat treatments typically involve following predetermined time and temperature schedules to obtain the desired final material properties. The intelligent processing approach is to develop sensors for monitoring of material response to processing operation in real time. As an alloy age hardens its electrical resistivity changes. Hence, the process of aging can be monitored by measuring the change is resistivity relative {{to that of a}} non-age hardening material such as fully annealed aluminum. A device using two small, spiral-wound probes was designed to induce eddy currents within the pure aluminum and the aging alloy. The probes were incorporated as elements in an impedance bridge circuit. The bridge unbalance voltage decreased in value over time indicating decreasing relativity during the aging process. The monitoring concept was verified. Refinements such as improved impedance <b>bridge</b> <b>circuitry</b> and probe size/test frequency optimization are needed to unlock its full potential.

40|$|SummaryTastes elicit innate {{behaviors}} {{critical for}} directing animals to ingest nutritious substances and reject toxic compounds, but the neural {{basis of these}} behaviors is not understood. Here, we use a neural silencing screen to identify neurons required for a simple Drosophila taste behavior and characterize a neural population that controls a specific subprogram of this behavior. By silencing and activating subsets of the defined cell population, we identify the neurons involved in the taste behavior {{as a pair of}} motor neurons located in the subesophageal ganglion (SOG). The motor neurons are activated by sugar stimulation of gustatory neurons and inhibited by bitter compounds; however, experiments utilizing split-GFP detect no direct connections between the motor neurons and primary sensory neurons, indicating that further study will be necessary to elucidate the <b>circuitry</b> <b>bridging</b> these populations. Combined, these results provide a general strategy and a valuable starting point for future taste circuit analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this research work is to design, develop and calibrate a transducer for measuring the horizontal drawbar pull of an agricultural tractor. The transducer design {{is based on a}} thin proof ring that forms {{an integral part of the}} drawbar element with strain gauges banded on the inside and outside curvatures of the proof ring. The strain gauges are arranged in a full <b>bridge</b> constant current <b>circuitry</b> and interfaced to a data acquisition system. Static calibration tests on the transducer showed high degree of linearity between applied load and output volt with coefficient of correlation R 2 equal to 0. 9968. The transducer measurements accuracy was within the acceptable range limits with measurement errors not more than 0. 67 % of the measured force magnitudes under static measurements. The data acquisition system was able to successfully scan and record the transducer signals as programmed. The developed transducer can be part a complete instrumentation system to be used for developing comprehensive information database on power and energy demand of various tractor field operations in Sudan...|$|R
40|$|Reflowable {{underfill}} is originated {{to simplify}} the Flip-Chip assembly process. In this study, JEDEC level 3 moisture sensitivity preconditioning followed by thermal cycling (TCB,- 55 oC~ 125 oC) was conducted. Two reflowable underfill mainly differentiated by curing kinetics and adhesion strength, namely Underfill A and Underfill C, were evaluated. Failure analysis was carried out via C-SAM and cross section. Unit failure that was electrically identified in present study was defined as occurrence of bridging and/or open circuit. The results showed that for packages assembled with Underfill A that has superior adhesion with silicon nitride passivation, all units can pass preconditioning but bridging commenced to appear at 750 cycles. Open circuitry was encountered between 1750 and 2000 cycles. While for Underfill C with fast cure characteristics and relatively weaker adhesion compared to Underfill A, <b>bridging</b> and open <b>circuitry</b> started to surface at 500 and 1250 cycles, respectively. Failure analysis indicated that bridging mainly resulted from solder bump extrusion through micro voids trapped between adjacent bumps during assembly process; meanwhile the gap between neighboring bumps {{is too close to}} prevent convergence of two extruded bumps. Open circuitry is originated by several factors such as insufficient wetting, underfill delamination, die crack, underfill crack etc. On the whole, no underfill delamination and die crack have been observed before 1000 cycles in present study. Most importantly, no solder crack that is the direct reflection of CTE mismatch has been observed throughout the whole reliability test. This fact suggests that assemblies with relatively-higher-CTE reflowable underfill still can meet general reliability standard...|$|R
40|$|For many years, the Wheatstone bridge {{has been}} used {{successfully}} to measure electrical resistance and changes in that resistance. However, the inherent problem of varying lead wire resistance can cause errors when the Wheatstone bridge is used to measure strain in a flight environment. The constant current loop signal-conditioning card was developed to overcome that difficulty. This paper describes a limited evaluation of the constant current loop strain measurement method as used in the F- 16 XL ship 2 Supersonic Laminar Flow Control flight project. Several identical strain gages were installed in close proximity on a shock fence which was mounted under the left wing of the F- 1 6 XL ship 2. Two strain gage bridges were configured using the constant current loop, and two were configured using the Wheatstone <b>bridge</b> <b>circuitry.</b> Flight data comparing the output from the constant current loop configured gages {{to that of the}} Wheatstone bridges with respect to signal output, error, and noise are given. Results indicate that the constant current loop strain measurement method enables an increased output, unaffected by lead wire resistance variations, to be obtained from strain gages...|$|E
40|$|At present {{there is}} a general {{industrial}} need to improve robot performance. Force feedback, which involves sensing and actuation, is one means of improving the relative position between the workpiece and the end-effector. In this research work various causes of errors and poor robot performance are identified. Several methods of improving the performance of robotic systems are discussed. As a result of this research, a system was developed which is interposed between the wrist and the gripper of the manipulator. This system integrates a force sensor with a micro-manipulator, via an electronic control unit, with a micro-computer to enhance a robot system. The force sensor, the micromanipulator and the electronic control unit, were all designed and manufactured at the robotic centre of Middlesex Polytechnic. The force feedback is provided by means of strain gauges and the associated <b>bridge</b> <b>circuitry.</b> Control algorithms which define the relationship between the force detected and the motion required are implemented in the software. The software is capable of performing two specific tasks in real time, these are: 1 - Inserting a peg into a hole 2 - Following an unknown geometric path A rig was designed and manufactured to enable the robot to follow different geometric shapes and paths in which force control was achieved mainly by control of the micro-manipulator...|$|E
40|$|The cell {{impedance}} analysis {{technique is}} a label-free, non-invasive method, which simplifies sample preparation and allows applications requiring unmodified cell retrieval. However, traditional impedance measurement methods suffer from various problems (speed, bandwidth, accuracy) for extracting the cellular impedance information. This thesis proposes an improved system for extracting precise cellular impedance in real-time, {{with a wide}} bandwidth and satisfactory accuracy. The system hardware consists of five main parts: a microelectrode array (MEA), a stimulation circuit, a sensing circuit, a multi-function card and a computer. The development of system hardware is explored. Accordingly, a novel bioimpedance measurement method coined digital auto balancing bridge method, which is improved from the traditional analogue auto balancing <b>bridge</b> <b>circuitry,</b> is realized for real-time cellular impedance measurement. Two different digital bridge balancing algorithms are proposed and realized, {{which are based on}} least mean squares (LMS) algorithm and fast block LMS (FBLMS) algorithm for single- and multi-frequency measurements respectively. Details on their implementation in FPGA are discussed. The test results prove that the LMS-based algorithm is suitable for accelerating the measurement speed in single-frequency situation, whilst the FBLMS-based algorithm has advantages in stable convergence in multi-frequency applications. A novel algorithm, called the All Phase Fast Fourier Transform (APFFT), is applied for post-processing of bioimpedance measurement results. Compared with the classical FFT algorithm, the APFFT significantly reduces spectral leakage caused by truncation error. Compared to the traditional FFT and Digital Quadrature Demodulation (DQD) methods, the APFFT shows excellent performance for extracting accurate phase and amplitude in the frequency spectrum. Additionally, testing and evaluation of the realized system has been performed. The results show that our system achieved a satisfactory accuracy within a wide bandwidth, a fast measurement speed and a good repeatability. Furthermore, our system is compared with a commercial impedance analyzer (Agilent 4294 A) in biological experiments. The results reveal that our system achieved a comparable accuracy to the commercial instrument in the biological experiments. Finally, conclusions are given and the future work is proposed...|$|E
40|$|The figure {{depicts a}} {{miniature}} cantilever-type anemometer {{that has been}} developed as a prototype of compact, relatively nonintrusive anemometers that can function at temperatures up to 600 C {{and that can be}} expected to be commercially mass-producible at low cost. The design of this anemometer, and especially the packaging aspect of the design, is intended to enable measurement of turbulence in the high-temperature, high-vibration environment of a turbine engine or in any similar environment. The main structural components of the anemometer include a single-crystal SiC cantilever and two polycrystalline SiC clamping plates, all made from chemical-vapor-deposited silicon carbide. Fabrication of these components from the same basic material eliminates thermal-expansion mismatch, which has introduced spurious thermomechanical stresses in cantilever-type anemometers of prior design. The clamping plates are heavily oxidized to improve electrical insulation at high temperature. A cavity that serves as a receptacle for the clamped end of the cantilever is etched into one end of one clamping plate. Trenches that collectively constitute a socket for a multipin electrical plug (for connection to external electronic circuitry) are etched into the opposite end of this clamping plate. Metal strips for electrical contact are deposited on one face of the other clamping plate. Piezoresistive single-crystal SiC thin-film strain gauges are etched in the n-type SiC epilayer in a Wheatstone-bridge configuration. Metal contact pads on the cantilever that extend into the clamping-receptacle area, are obtained by deposition and patterning using standard semiconductor photolithography and etching methods. The cantilever and the two clamping plates are assembled into a sandwich structure that is then clamped in a stainless-steel housing. The Wheatstone- bridge carrying SiC cantilever with the metal contact pads on the piezoresistors is slid into the receptacle in the bottom clamping plate. The top clamping plate is brought into contact with the bottom plate so that the narrow section of the metal strips on the top clamp plate aligns with the metal contact pads on the cantilever. When the parts are clamped together, the metal strips provide electrical connections between the Wheatstone-bridge contact points and the sides the trenches that constitute the socket for the multipin electrical plug. Hence, to connect the Wheatstone <b>bridge</b> to external <b>circuitry</b> for processing of the anemometer readout, one need only insert the plug in the socket. In operation, the cantilever end of the stainless-steel housing is mounted flush with an engine wall and the unclamped portion of the cantilever is exposed into the flow. The cantilever is deflected in direct proportion to the force induced by component of flow parallel to the engine wall and perpendicular to the broad exposed face of the cantilever. The maximum strain on the cantilever occurs at the clamped edge and is measured by the piezoresistors, which are located there. The corresponding changes in resistance manifest themselves in the output of the Wheatstone bridge...|$|R
