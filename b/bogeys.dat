25|$|Rory McIlroy shot a bogey-free {{round of}} 66 (−6) {{to take a}} one-stroke lead over Matteo Manassero. World number one Adam Scott, Sergio García, {{brothers}} Edoardo and Francesco Molinari, Shane Lowry, Brooks Koepka and Jim Furyk were another shot further back at 68 (−4). Three-time champion Tiger Woods, playing in his first major championship of the year following back surgery, rebounded from <b>bogeys</b> on his first two holes to post a round of 69 (−3).|$|E
25|$|If {{the rail}} {{line has been}} built with {{sufficient}} vertical clearance then Double-stack rail transport can be used. Where lines are electrified with overhead electric wiring double stacking is normally not possible. The mandatory requirement to fit under overhead wire for the traction engine electrical power supply sets the height limit for the railcars to allow for trailer transport. This requires a certain low building height {{which led to a}} minor size of wheels for the railcars. Hence increased degradation of <b>bogeys</b> by wheel wear-out is a cost disadvantage for the system.|$|E
25|$|On May 31, Mickelson {{announced}} that he would return to play on the PGA Tour in June at the St. Jude Classic and the U.S. Open, since he had heard from the doctors treating his wife that her cancer had been detected in an early stage. Mickelson shot a final round 70 at the 2009 U.S. Open and recorded his fifth runner-up finish at the U.S. Open. He shared the lead after an eagle at the 13th hole, but fell back with <b>bogeys</b> on 15 and 17; Lucas Glover captured the championship.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Bogey</b> {{means one}} shot more than par (+1). [...] "Going round in bogey" [...] {{originally}} meant an overall par score, {{starting at the}} Great Yarmouth Golf Club in 1890, {{and based on the}} phrase [...] "bogey man" [...] and a popular music hall song Here Comes the <b>Bogey</b> Man. Nationally, players competed against Colonel <b>Bogey,</b> and this gave the title to a 1914 marching tune, Colonel <b>Bogey</b> March.|$|R
5000|$|In June, Els almost {{captured}} {{his third}} U.S. Open title at Pebble Beach. Els briefly held {{a share of}} the lead after birding the sixth hole, but was derailed by a stretch of <b>bogey,</b> double <b>bogey,</b> <b>bogey</b> on 9,10, and 11. [...] Els finished the tournament in solo 3rd.|$|R
50|$|Before {{his time}} with the Alpha Teens, Hawk was {{enrolled}} in a flight school where he developed a rivalry with another pilot named <b>Bogey.</b> They pushed each other to see who was the best pilot, but <b>Bogey's</b> actions almost got them both killed. Both men were expelled after <b>Bogey</b> blamed Hawk for the incident during an inquest.|$|R
25|$|McIlroy {{played the}} {{following}} week at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Miami, Florida. His recent good form began to dwindle slightly on Thursday, when he shot a 1-over par 73. However, he shot 69 and 65 {{the next two days}} to begin the fourth round in tied 8th place. Going into the back 9 on Sunday, he had a chance of winning his second title of 2012 in as many weeks due to the leaders faltering. However two late <b>bogeys</b> halted his chance and he settled for 3rd place, two strokes behind winner Justin Rose.|$|E
25|$|At the 2006 Open Championship, Woods almost {{exclusively}} used long irons {{off the tee}} (he hit driver only one time the entire week—the 16th hole of the first round), he missed just four fairways all week (hitting the fairway 92% of the time), and his score of −18 to par (three eagles, 19 birdies, 43 pars, and seven <b>bogeys)</b> was just one off of his major championship record −19, set at St Andrews in 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). The victory was an emotional one for Woods, who dedicated his play to his father's memory.|$|E
25|$|Two months later, Woods was {{the only}} player under par at the U.S. Open, and resurrected buzz about the {{calendar}} Grand Slam, which had eluded him in 2000. All eyes were on Woods at the Open Championship, but his third round score of 81 in dreadful weather at Muirfield ended his Grand Slam hopes. At the PGA Championship, he nearly repeated his 2000 feat of winning three majors in one year, but <b>bogeys</b> at the 13th and 14th holes {{in the final round}} cost him the championship by one stroke. Nonetheless, he took home the money title, Vardon Trophy, and Player of the Year honors for the fourth year in a row.|$|E
5000|$|Apart from a <b>bogey</b> device being a {{theoretical}} device {{that has the}} given characteristics, the term can refer to a specially-selected example of a device (e.g. from a production run where care is taken to ensure each characteristic has its nominal value); for example a <b>bogey</b> tube {{could be used to}} calibrate tube testers and be expected to give readings {{in the middle of the}} meter's [...] "good" [...] region. Hence a tube can be specified by its <b>bogey</b> values and suitable tolerances, and tests are based on the <b>bogey</b> values. For applications such as music amplifiers where the channels need to have nearly identical performance, it is desirable that components are matched and have major parameter values close to <b>bogey.</b>|$|R

25|$|Masters {{champion}} Jordan Spieth shot a {{round of}} 67 (−3) to tie Patrick Reed for the 36-hole lead. First round co-leader Dustin Johnson got as low as 7-under before <b>bogeys</b> on three of his last five holes dropped him to a stroke behind the leaders. Jason Day was just two shots off the lead playing the 9th hole, his 18th of the round, when he collapsed from vertigo. After being treated by medical personnel for several minutes, Day was able to finish the hole and made bogey, dropping to three behind and a tie for 9th place. Tiger Woods missed the cut with a two-round score of 16-over-par, his worst 36-hole score in a major.|$|E
25|$|Four {{weeks later}} at the 2006 PGA Championship, Woods again won in {{dominating}} fashion, making only three <b>bogeys,</b> tying the record for fewest in a major. He finished the tournament at 18-under-par, equaling the to-par record in the PGA that he shares with Bob May from 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). In August 2006, he won his 50th professional tournament at the Buick Open—and {{at the age of}} thirty years and seven months, he became the youngest golfer to do so. He ended the year by winning six consecutive PGA Tour events, and won the three most prestigious awards given by the PGA Tour (Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer, and Byron Nelson Awards) in the same year for a record seventh time.|$|E
25|$|At the 2002 U.S. Open, a {{month before}} his 45th birthday, Faldo {{finished}} in a very creditable position of tied for 5th place. At the 2003 Open Championship at Royal St George's, Faldo shot a fine third round of 67 and was briefly in contention for the tournament during the final round. He closed to within two shots of the lead after a birdie at the 5th hole {{in the final round}} before holing a 30-foot eagle putt on the 7th. However, his momentum stalled over the next three holes. A birdie at the 14th hole took him to level par and into fourth place. However, three successive <b>bogeys</b> on his subsequent three holes ended his challenge and he finished the tournament in a tie for eighth place. To date, Faldo has not had a top-10 finish in a major since this event.|$|E

50|$|There is some {{confusion}} about the march Colonel <b>Bogey</b> and its use in the film The Bridge on the River Kwai. While Sir Malcolm Arnold did use Colonel <b>Bogey</b> in his score for the film, {{it was only the}} first theme and a bit of the second theme of Colonel <b>Bogey,</b> whistled unaccompanied by the British prisoners several times as they marched into the prison camp, the whistled theme eventually supported by the first theme of Arnold’s original “River Kwai March”, the opening theme of which was based on the same chord progression as the first theme of Colonel <b>Bogey.</b> From that point on it was pure Arnold, though in the movie sequence the complete Arnold march was not heard.|$|R
50|$|The film premiered in German theaters on 25 December 2013. It was an {{immediate}} box-office hit and earned the producers two <b>Bogey</b> Awards, one for more than 1,000 visitors per copy on its opening weekend, and a second <b>Bogey</b> for 1 million visitors within ten days.|$|R
25|$|After {{returning}} from knee surgery, Singh started the 2011 season making {{five out of}} his first five cuts. In February, Singh was in contention to win his first PGA Tour Title since 2008 at the Waste Management Phoenix Open in Scottsdale, Arizona. Despite shooting a final round 66, Singh finished two shots behind Jason Dufner and eventual winner Mark Wilson. A couple weeks later, Singh was in contention again, this time at the Northern Trust Open at Riviera Country Club. However he came up short again, not helped by back-to-back <b>bogeys</b> on holes 12 and 13. He would eventually finish two shots back of the winner Aaron Baddeley, although he did secure second spot on his own. This early season form however {{was not enough to}} secure a spot at the opening World Golf Championship of the year, the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship the following week. However, at number 10 in the 2011 FedEx Cup standings, it was just enough to secure a spot at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in March.|$|E
25|$|His next tournament was the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship in Arizona. Woods battled to win {{his first}} round match against Gonzalo Fernández-Castaño, 1-up, and then played Nick Watney in the second round. On the 18th hole, Woods had to make birdie to extend the match, however his 5-foot putt missed and he was knocked out of the tournament. Woods commented that his putting was {{hindered}} technically and required some work after battling with it throughout the round. The following week Woods teed off at the Honda Classic in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. Woods commented that he had referred back to putting basics instead of new technique he had been applying. Woods' putting over {{the first three days}} of tournament play was noticeably better, but the ball was struggling to fall into the hole. Tiger began the fourth round on 2-under par, 9 shots behind leader Rory McIlroy. After parring the first hole and being delayed by adverse weather, Woods returned and played the remaining 17 holes in 8-under par including two eagles and no <b>bogeys.</b> A birdie-eagle finish set up Woods to possibly claim the title, however McIlroy kept his cool and won the tournament. Tiger finished joint second, and the round also marked his lowest final round score in his PGA Tour career.|$|E
500|$|His final World War II aerial kill {{occurred}} on April 7, 1945, when Olds in Scat VI led the 479th Fighter Group {{on a mission}} escorting B-24s bombing an ammunition dump in Lüneburg, Germany. The engagement marked the only combat appearance of Sonderkommando Elbe, a German Air Force Squadron formed to ram Allied bombers. [...] South of Bremen, Olds noticed contrails popping up above a bank of cirrus clouds, of aircraft flying above {{and to the left}} of the bombers. For five minutes these <b>bogeys</b> paralleled the bomber stream while the 479th held station. Turning to investigate, Olds saw pairs of Me 262s turn towards and dive on the Liberators. After damaging one of the jets in a chase meant to lure the fighter escort away from the bombers, the Mustangs returned to the bomber stream. Olds observed a Bf 109 of Sonderkommando Elbe attack the bombers and shoot down a B-24. Olds pursued the Bf 109 through the [...] formation, and shot it down.|$|E

Fisher dropped back with a quadruple bogey 8 on the 5th hole and was never in contention again. Lee Westwood eagled the 7th hole {{to move into the}} lead, which he held or shared for most of the round, but <b>bogeys</b> at three of the last four holes put him one stroke behind clubhouse leader Cink, who rolled in a [...] putt for birdie at the 18th to move to two-under, one clear of the previous year's leading amateur Chris Wood.|$|E
2500|$|Four players {{began the}} final round tied for the lead {{for the first time}} at the U.S. Open since 1973. In the final pairing with Jason Day at 3 pm PDT, Dustin Johnson {{recorded}} two birdies on the front nine to take sole possession of the lead, then lost it with <b>bogeys</b> on three out of four holes to begin the back nine. In the penultimate pairing, Jordan Spieth and Branden Grace both birdied the par-4 12th to tie, but Grace fell from contention on the 16th after his drive went out of bounds and he made double bogey. Spieth holed a [...] birdie putt at the 16th to open up a three-stroke lead, but then three-putted for double bogey on the par-3 17th to fall into a tie with Louis Oosthuizen. Oosthuizen began the round three shots off the lead and quickly dropped further behind with three consecutive <b>bogeys</b> on the front-nine. Beginning at the 12th, however, Oosthuizen birdied six out of his last seven holes to tie Spieth. At the par-5 18th, Spieth hit the green in two and proceeded to two-putt for birdie. Johnson recovered from his bogey streak with a birdie at the 17th, then also found the 18th green in two. Faced with a [...] eagle putt to win the championship, Johnson's attempt rolled three feet (0.9 m) past the hole, then missed his birdie putt to tie. Expecting a Monday playoff, Spieth suddenly gained a one-stroke victory for his second consecutive major title.|$|E
2500|$|The cut was at 144 (+4) and 73 players {{advanced}} to the weekend. Sixteen-year-old British Amateur Champion Matteo Manassero played with Watson and posted 141 and all but secured the silver medal as the leading amateur. Among those to miss the cut was world number one and pre-tournament favorite Tiger Woods. Going out in the afternoon, his 74 included two double <b>bogeys</b> on holes 10 and 13, and his 145 [...] missed the cut by a stroke. It was his first missed cut at the Open, and only the second missed cut in a major as a professional, after the 2006 U.S. Open. Other notables to miss the cut included Mike Weir (67–78=145), Ben Curtis (65–80=145), David Duval (71–76=147), and Geoff Ogilvy (75–78=153).|$|E

2500|$|Woods {{returned}} for the 2008 U.S. Open {{in one of}} the most anticipated golf groupings in history including Woods, Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott, the top three golfers in the world. Woods struggled the first day, notching a double bogey on his first hole. He would end the round at +1 (72), four shots off the lead. He scored −3 (68) his second day, still paired with Mickelson, managing 5 birdies, 1 eagle and 4 <b>bogeys.</b> On the third day of the tournament, he began with a double bogey once again and was trailing by five shots with six holes to play. However, he finished the round by making two eagle putts, a combined [...] in length, and a chip-in birdie to take a one-shot lead into the final round. His final putt assured that he would be in the final group for the sixth time in the last eight major championships.|$|E
2500|$|Two months later, in July 1987, Faldo {{claimed his}} first major title at The Open Championship at Muirfield. After rounds of 68 (-3) and 69 (-2), Faldo emerged through stormy {{conditions}} with an even-par 71, thus entering the final round one stroke behind American Paul Azinger. Faldo parred every hole in his final round for a one shot victory. At one point Azinger held a lead of three shots with nine holes to play, but <b>bogeys</b> at four of his last nine holes, including at the 17th and 18th, placed him a stroke behind Faldo. In cool misty weather conditions, Faldo's solid and steady play {{in the final round}} won him the Open title a day after his 30th birthday. He holed a five-foot putt on the final hole for his 18th consecutive par. Faldo later said: [...] "I knew I'd do it. And I knew I had to do it." [...] Highlighting a bunker shot on the 8th hole as a key shot of his final round, Faldo said: [...] "The one at 8 was fantastic, a 35-yard shot and I knocked it to three feet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nicklaus won the Masters in 1965 and 1966, {{becoming}} the first consecutive winner of this event, and the youngest two-time and three-time winner. He broke Ben Hogan's 72-hole scoring record of 274 from 1953 by compiling a new aggregate of 271 in the 1965 Masters Tournament, which while tied by Raymond Floyd in 1976, lasted until Tiger Woods shot 270 in 1997, a 72-hole record subsequently tied by Jordan Spieth in 2015. [...] Woods's and Spieth's scores of 270 were achieved with significantly improved golf equipment on essentially the same-length golf course over which Nicklaus and Floyd scored 271. During this 1965 tournament, Nicklaus hit 62 of 72 greens in regulation, and had 123 putts, inclusive of just one three-putt green. This {{was good enough to}} win by nine shots over Arnold Palmer and Gary Player; this margin of victory was a tournament record that would last for 32 years until Woods won by 12 shots in 1997. The week's performance was highlighted by a third-round 64 that consisted of eight birdies and no <b>bogeys.</b> It was of this round that Nicklaus said, [...] "I had never before and have never since played quite as fine a complete round of golf in a major championship as I did in the third round of the 1965 Masters". This round tied Lloyd Mangrum's record set in 1940 at Augusta National and remained in place until Nick Price shot 63 during the third round in 1986. It was at this time that Bobby Jones stated Nicklaus played a game with which he was unfamiliar; Jones called Nicklaus' result [...] "the greatest performance in all of golfing history." ...|$|E
