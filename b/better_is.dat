25|$|Never <b>Better</b> <b>is</b> about Keith Merchant (Mangan), a {{recovering}} alcoholic in his mid-thirties whose life {{never seems to}} get better. His problems come from him being self-centred and preoccupied with his own flaws. He attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but his behaviour often turns meetings into a farce, to the annoyance of group leader Doug (Christopher Fairbank). He has a family, with his wife Anita (Ashfield) and two children, Tom and Poppy. Whilst he attempts {{to be a good}} husband and father, his optimism for his family and attempts {{to do the right thing}} tend to lead to even more problems. Outside of AA, he has his friend Richard (Tom Goodman-Hill) for support, although Richard believes that Keith was a better friend when he was drinking.|$|E

[...] The first two indices describe the wave travelling {{up and down}} the length of the cavity, that is, they are the transverse mode numbers as for modes in a waveguide.

[...] The third index is equal to the number of half wavelengths {{down the length of the}} guide. [...] The most common modes used are the dominant modes: TE101 in rectangular waveguide, and TE111 in circular waveguide.

500|$|Large-scale {{industrial}} fractionation towers use reflux {{to achieve}} more efficient separation of products. Reflux {{refers to the}} portion of the condensed overhead liquid product from a distillation tower that is returned to {{the upper part of the}} tower as shown in images 3 and 4. Inside the tower, the downflowing reflux liquid provides cooling and partial condensation of the upflowing vapors, thereby increasing the efficacy of the distillation tower. The more reflux that is provided, the <b>better</b> <b>is</b> the tower's separation of the lower boiling from the higher boiling components of the feed. [...] A balance of heating with a reboiler at the bottom of a column and cooling by condensed reflux at the top of the column maintains a temperature gradient (or gradual temperature difference) along the height of the column to provide good conditions for fractionating the feed mixture. Reflux flows at the middle of the tower are called pumparounds.|$|E
