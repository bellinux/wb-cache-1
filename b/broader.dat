5|$|The {{inclination}} {{distribution of}} Jupiter-family (or ecliptic) comets would become <b>broader</b> {{under the influence}} of Planet Nine. Jupiter-family comets originate primarily from the scattering objects, trans-Neptunian objects with semi-major axes that vary over time due to distant encounters with Neptune. In a model including Planet Nine, the scattering objects that reach large semi-major axes dynamically interact with Planet Nine, increasing their inclinations. As a result, the population of the scattering objects, and the population of comets derived from it, is left with a <b>broader</b> inclination distribution. This inclination distribution is <b>broader</b> than is observed, in contrast to a five-planet Nice model without a Planet Nine that can closely match the observed inclination distribution.|$|E

40|$|In the manuscript, the {{properties}} of the proposed intermediate BLR are checked for the mapped AGN PG 0052 + 251. With the considerations of the apparent effects of the <b>broad</b> He ii line on the observed <b>broad</b> Hβ profile, the line parameters (especially the line width and the line flux) of the observed <b>broad</b> Hα and the <b>broad</b> Hβ are carefully determined. Based on the measured line parameters, the model with two <b>broad</b> components applied for each observed <b>broad</b> balmer line is preferred, and then confirmed by the calculated much different time lags for the inner/intermediate <b>broad</b> components and the corresponding virial BH masses ratio determined by {{the properties}} of the inner and the intermediate <b>broad</b> components. Then, the correlation between the <b>broad</b> line width and the <b>broad</b> line flux is checked for the two <b>broad</b> components: one clearly strong negative correlation for the inner <b>broad</b> component, but one positive correlation for the intermediate <b>broad</b> component. The different correlations for the two <b>broad</b> components strongly support the intermediate BLR of PG 0052 + 251.
