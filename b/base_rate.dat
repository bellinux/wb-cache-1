5|$|However, the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 ended this period of stability, and, on 16 April 2007, the governor (at that time Mervyn King), was obliged to write the first MPC open letter to the chancellor (Gordon Brown), explaining why the inflation had deviated from the target of 2% per year {{by more than one}} percentage point (3.1%). By February 2013, he had had to write 14 such letters to chancellors. Between October 2008 and March 2009 the <b>base</b> <b>rate</b> was cut six times to an all-time low of 0.5% in order to avoid deflation and spur growth. In March 2009, the MPC launched a programme of quantitative easing, initially injecting £75 billion into the economy. By March 2010, it had also increased the amount of money set aside for quantitative easing to £200 billion, a figure later increased by a further £75 billion in the months following October 2011. The MPC announced two further £50 billion rounds of quantitative easing in February and July 2012, bringing the total to £375 billion whilst simultaneously keeping the <b>base</b> <b>rate</b> at 0.5%. In March 2013, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, called on the MPC to follow its American counterpart (the Federal Reserve Board) in committing itself to keeping interest rates low for a prolonged period of time via appropriate forward guidance, which it did on 7 August.|$|E

As argued above in the Introduction section, the published articles suggesting that doctors do use <b>base</b> <b>rates</b> contain serious limitations. In the present study, we tested whether residents who believe a disease to be more prevalent tend to judge the disease as more likely in the differential diagnosis. Though this effect was expected to be subtle, we did find affirmative evidence that residents are sensitive to <b>base</b> <b>rates.</b> These findings are comforting in that residents appear to be “more Bayesian” than we might expect.|$|R

5|$|These {{measures}} eventually proved {{insufficient to}} avoid deflation. Having taken over in August 2013, Governor Mark Carney wrote his first open letter in February 2015 {{to explain why}} inflation had fallen below 1% {{for the first time}} in the MPC's history. This was followed by deflation of 0.1% in April 2015, the first month of negative CPI growth since the 1960s, and triggering a second letter. As of February 2015, Carney has written five such letters. Following the UK's vote to leave the European Union in June 2016, the MPC cut the <b>base</b> <b>rate</b> from 0.5% to 0.25%, the first change since March 2009. At the same time, it announced a further round of quantitative easing, valued at £60 billion, bringing the total to £435 billion.|$|E
5|$|Banks {{started the}} 1964–65 season on wages of £40 a week, {{and the club}} only agreed to pay £60 a week in December. These miserly wages made it {{difficult}} for the club to spend the £80,000 it received from the sale of Frank McLintock – he had put in a transfer request over dissatisfaction with his pay and quality replacements were reluctant to join a club that paid full internationals like Banks and McLintock no more than the <b>base</b> <b>rate</b> that rival clubs paid to average players. Leicester finished 18th in the league and were knocked out of the FA Cup by Liverpool at Anfield in the sixth round. In the League Cup, City struggled to get past Peterborough United (in a replay), Grimsby Town and Crystal Palace (in a replay), before they recorded an 8–1 victory over Coventry City at Highfield Road.

40|$|Background: Hot spots {{policing}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} influential police innovations, with a strong body of experimental research showing it to be effective in reducing crime and disorder. However, most studies have been conducted in major cities, and we thus know little about whether it is effective in smaller cities, which account for a majority of police agencies. The lack of experimental studies in smaller cities is likely in part due to challenges designing statistically powerful tests in such contexts. Objectives: The current article explores the challenges of statistical power and “noise” resulting from low <b>base</b> <b>rates</b> of crime in smaller cities and provides suggestions for future evaluations to overcome these limitations. Research Design: Data from a randomized experimental evaluation of broken windows policing in hot spots are used to illustrate the challenges that low <b>base</b> <b>rates</b> present for evaluating hot spots policing programs in smaller cities. Results: Analyses show low <b>base</b> <b>rates</b> make it difficult to detect treatment effects. Very large effect sizes would be required to reach sufficient power, and random fluctuations around low <b>base</b> <b>rates</b> make detecting treatment effects difficult, irrespective of power, by masking differences between treatment and control groups. Conclusions: Low <b>base</b> <b>rates</b> present strong challenges to researchers attempting to evaluate hot spots policing in smaller cities. As such, <b>base</b> <b>rates</b> must be taken directly into account when designing experimental evaluations. The article offers suggestions for researchers attempting to expand the examination of hot spots policing and other microplace-based interventions to smaller jurisdictions. No Full Tex...|$|R
25|$|Until 2005, {{the value}} of the renminbi was pegged to the US dollar. As China pursued its {{transition}} from central planning to a market economy, and increased its participation in foreign trade, the renminbi was devalued to increase the competitiveness of Chinese industry. It has previously been claimed that the renminbi's official exchange rate was undervalued by as much as 37.5% against its purchasing power parity. More recently, however, appreciation actions by the Chinese government, as well as quantitative easing measures taken by the American Federal Reserve and other major central banks, have caused the renminbi to be within as little as 8% of its equilibrium value by the second half of 2012. Since 2006, the renminbi exchange rate has been allowed to float in a narrow margin around a fixed <b>base</b> <b>rate</b> determined with reference to a basket of world currencies. The Chinese government has announced that it will gradually increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. As a result of the rapid internationalization of the renminbi, it became the world's 8th most traded currency in 2013, and 5th by 2015.|$|E
25|$|Tony Blair became Prime Minister in 1997 after a {{landslide}} {{victory over the}} Conservative Party. Under the title of New Labour, he promised economic and social reform and brought Labour closer to {{the centre of the}} political spectrum. Early policies of the Blair government included the minimum wage and the introduction of university tuition fees. Chancellor of the Exchequer Gordon Brown also gave the Bank of England the power to set the <b>base</b> <b>rate</b> of interest autonomously. The traditional tendency of governments to manipulate interest rates around the time of general elections for political gain is thought to have been deleterious to the UK economy and helped reinforce a cyclical pattern of boom and bust. Brown's decision was popular with the City, which the Labour Party had been courting since the early 1990s. Blair presided over the longest period of economic expansion in Britain since the 19th century and his premiership saw large investment into social aspects, in particular health and education, areas particularly under-invested during the Conservative government of the 1980s and early 1990s. The Human Rights Act was introduced in 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act came into force in 2000. Most hereditary peers were removed from the House of Lords in 1999 and the Civil Partnership Act of 2005 allowed homosexual couples the right to register their partnership with the same rights and responsibilities comparable to heterosexual marriage.|$|E
25|$|Payment on the {{new deal}} was {{originally}} expected {{to be based on}} the fighter's spot in the official UFC rankings, with the exception of the UFC champions.

In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters will also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program will also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself is reported to be worth 70 million dollars which is what the fighters will be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card. In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation. The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits will feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters will have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality.
