500|$|Erika Ramirez of Billboard {{concluded}} that [...] "Euphoria" [...] is grittier, more startling and arguably {{more powerful than}} [...] "Numb" [...] and commented that it [...] "leaves listeners with a feeling that reflects the song's uplifting title". Alex Macpherson of guardian.co.uk was more critical to the song and labeled it as [...] "eurotrash trance", while Danny Walker of RWD Magazine called the song pacy. According to Carrie Battan of Pitchfork Media Usher [...] "sounds most uncomfortable and the least sharp on overblown club tracks 'Euphoria' and 'Numb', {{and the presence of}} rote numbers is almost comically predictable." [...] Katherine St Asaph of Popdust stated that the track would sound great in the clubs, however it isn't standout by any means, further stating [...] "Usher and Swedish House Mafia talk about euphoria, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> deliver is perfectly passable excitement." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{returned}} to the United States {{in the summer of}} 1856 and began his college duties. Towards the end of his professorship, then-president of Harvard Charles William Eliot noted that Lowell seemed to have [...] "no natural inclination" [...] to teach; Lowell agreed, but retained his position for twenty years. He focused on teaching literature, rather than etymology, hoping that his students would learn to enjoy the sound, rhythm, and flow of poetry rather than the technique of words. He summed up his method: [...] "True scholarship consists in knowing not what things exists, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> mean; it is not memory but judgment." [...] Still grieving the loss of his wife, during this time Lowell avoided Elmwood and instead lived on Kirkland Street in Cambridge, an area known as Professors' Row. He stayed there, along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap, until January 1861.|$|E

The audition consisted of him performing seven different sounds, ranging from Frank Sinatra to Sly Stone. He was successful and became a featured singer {{during the first three}} seasons of the series. Holley later noted that the concept of diversity in vocal performance was not a new experience for him. [...] "I've been at sessions where a producer has said he wants me to sound like Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen at the same time. I've had people say can you make it a little more green. Huh? It's tricky." [...] He added, [...] "Sometimes they think they want Sheryl Crow, because she has a hit single. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> really want is magic, and that is whatever you, as an individual, can bring.

The album produced four singles, {{all of which}} reached top 40 on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. The first of these, the [...] "Walk Softly on This Heart of Mine" [...] cover, peaked at number 25 in December 1989. After it came [...] "Dumas Walker," [...] about a then-74-year-old marbles player who owned a liquor store that the band frequented. According to Doug, Mercury Records was initially reluctant to release the song as a single: [...] " [...] thought it was too regional, {{and that no one}} outside the area would get it, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> didn't see, was the reaction we got to it every night that we played it in front of a crowd, and it didn't matter where we were playing either."

500|$|Nansen {{called this}} first land [...] "Hvidtenland" [...] ("White Island"). After making camp on an ice foot they ascended a slope and looked about them. It was {{apparent}} {{that they were in}} an archipelago, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> could see bore no relation to their incomplete map of Franz Josef Land. They could only continue south in the hopes of finding a geographical feature they could pinpoint with certainty. On 16 August Nansen tentatively identified a headland as Cape Felder, marked on Payer's maps as on the western coast of Franz Josef Land. Nansen's objective was now to reach a hut and supplies that had been left by an earlier expedition at a location known as Eira Harbour, {{at the southern end of}} the islands. However, contrary winds and loose ice made further progress in the kayak hazardous, and on 28 August Nansen decided that, with another polar winter drawing near, they should stay where they were and await the following spring.|$|E

She {{was nervous about}} performing with Paul, who explained, [...] "she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy." [...] Paul defended her musical ability: [...] "I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard... She {{took a couple of}} lessons and learned some bluesy things... she did very well and made it look easier than it was... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a Minimoog, which could only be played with one finger. It was monophonic." [...] He went on to say, [...] "We thought we were in it for the fun... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong—big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves." [...] Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, [...] "trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned." ...|$|E

[...] Rhimes also explains why {{it took so long}} to produce this episode: [...] The script was written by Rhimes in November 2010. She centered the episode around Ramirez's character, Callie, and stated that the storyline would have developed regardless of whether it involved musical performances. Sara Ramirez used the opportunity to launch her career as a singer-songwriter; an alternate version of [...] "The Story" [...] is included on her debut EP, released four days prior to the episode's premiere. The episode served to improve the relationship between Mark and Arizona. Capshaw assessed that, [...] "The traumatic circumstance leads to them having a greater understanding of each other and then appreciation, and then need for each other and desire to be in each other’s lives. They come to care, I think, for one another." ...|$|E
500|$|Tammareddy Bharadwaja said [...] "Ever since Arundhati and Magadheera {{did well}} at the box office, {{the rest of the}} {{industry}} started following their footsteps. Also, since there is an irrational craze to make high budget films right now, producers are turning towards mythological films. It is the only genre where you can boast of spending crores for creating the sets and the look of the film. <b>But</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> don't realize is that if these films flop, the blow to the producer will be severe." [...] Films like Anaganaga O Dheerudu (2011) and Shakti (2011) were commercial failures and Badrinath (2012) was an average grosser; all being fantasy films in which the protagonist is a warrior. The promos of Badrinath looked similar to Magadheera and the former's director V. V. Vinayak along with its male lead Allu Arjun kept insisting that Badrinath is dissimilar to Magadheera. Producer Natti Kumar said [...] "If a hero delivers a hit, producers run after him for five years and burn their fingers only after six or eight flops. It's the same story with movies. Since Magadheera became a hit, every other hero and director wants to do period film where there is scope to spend crores. They don't work on the script, story or relevance. It is a pure display of graphics, heroes' abs and grandeur. The plot is lost. Magadheera worked because it was a novel genre then, but why will people want to see the same things again?".|$|E
500|$|Usher and Minaj {{shot the}} music video on March 9, 2010 in Los Angeles with {{director}} Taj Stansberry, represented by Leah Harmony and Ciarra Pardo. In {{an interview with}} Vibe, Stansberry commented on the video's sex appeal and the pairing of Usher and Minaj, stating, [...] "This probably {{has the potential to}} be [...] Usher’s one of the best entertainers in the world, then you have Nicki Minaj who’s fresh on the scene. Put them together and there’s just sparks, it was real good." [...] When asked about the music video's concept would redefine the word [...] "freak", commenting: [...] "My general idea was to take the word and show its many faceted sides, twisting and turning it to where there’s really no distinguishing between one freak and another. Usher went there. When you’re engaging in sexual activity, there are many transitions and this is not about what they look like literally, <b>but</b> <b>what</b> <b>they</b> look like metaphorically. It’s about luring people into a situation. Because you have your thoughts on a ménage à trois, but then we’re doing it in a non-obvious way." [...] On Minaj and her pairing with Usher, Stansberry said, [...] " [...] had a few looks that I really liked. She played the part, but still was her. If you really listen to her words in the song, you can kinda visualize her outfit." [...] Stansberry also confirmed that R singer Ciara and singer-actor Jamie Foxx would make appearances in the video. In an interview with MTV News on the set of her video for [...] "Massive Attack", Minaj said that [...] "The video is freaky. And it's a great concept, a great story line," [...] Minaj told MTV News. [...] "It felt just like one of the sequels to Saw. It was dope." [...] Stating that the video had a [...] "secret society" [...] concept, Usher told Access Hollywood that the place symbolized locations where people use to get away from pressures, and also said the movie Eyes Wide Shut was some sort of inspiration of the video. On March 22, 2010 a thirty second preview of the music video was surfaced onto the internet. Two days later on March 24, 2010, Usher premiered the full music video on BET's 106 & Park.|$|E
