30|$|In most of {{case series}} {{reported}} in literature on valgus osteotomy [23 – 25], <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> fixation has been used, which is technically demanding. In internal fixation of valgus osteotomy by double angle <b>blade</b> <b>plate,</b> at times blade may displace the fracture fragments and minimal {{change in the}} direction of blade may change the direction of plate anterior or posterior to the shaft of femur. Most orthopaedic surgeons are accustomed to the use of dynamic hip screw, which is commonly used in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures, and is technically much simpler than <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> fixation. In dynamic hip screw fixation, powered instruments could be used, which saves time and reduces blood loss.

30|$|Recent {{developments}} in fracture fixation, incorporating locking screws {{to improve the}} biomechanical construct, have been introduced to implants for internal fixation in proximal femoral osteotomy [9, 10, 11]. A second significant innovation was {{the development of a}} one-piece cannulated <b>blade</b> <b>plate,</b> which can be inserted over a guide wire [12]. The guide wire is inserted in the desired position in the proximal femur. The seating chisel is passed over the guide wire to cut the track for the <b>blade</b> <b>plate,</b> which is also inserted over the guide wire. This differs from classical PFO with AO <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> fixation, in which a guide wire is inserted in the proximal femur and the insertion of the seating chisel and implant is referenced from the position and direction of this wire, but not passed directly over the guide wire [7, 8]. The cannulated <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> concept was described by Grant and colleagues in 1990 but has only become widely available commercially in recent years [12, 13]. In 2013, Poul and colleagues reported more precise correction of proximal femoral deformities in a study in which the Cannulated Paediatric Osteotomy System (CAPOS) was compared to the conventional angled <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> (Synthes) [13].|$|E

Little formal evaluation exists for specifically designed percutaneous extramedullary implants. The {{purpose of this study}} was to compare 3 locked plating constructs, all with percutaneous insertion capability, with the standard 95 -degree angled <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> to determine whether specifically designed fixed-angle extramedullary implants for subtrochanteric femur fractures were biomechanically comparable to the angled <b>blade</b> <b>plate.</b> Methods: Forty composite adult femurs were divided into 4 equal groups. The constructs evaluated included a 95 -degree angled <b>blade</b> <b>plate,</b> a broad 4. 5 -mm combination locking plate, and a precontoured proximal femoral locking plate (PFLP) with and without an oblique, angled strut or ‘‘kickstand’’screw. A 30 -degree wedge osteotomy was used to create a subtrochanteric fracture gap model. Each specimen underwent axial and torsional stiffness testing along with cyclic axial loading to failure.

40|$|In this paper, {{premature}} {{fracture of}} two condylar <b>blade</b> <b>plates</b> that failed inside the thigh of two separate patients is investigated. Condylar <b>blade</b> <b>plates</b> made of 316 L {{austenitic stainless steel}} are widely used for internal fixation and repair of femoral fractures in orthopedic surgery. Fracture of such plates could have serious consequences such {{as the need for}} repeated surgery, extra unwanted complications and extension of the healing period. In addition to selecting the proper plate for fixation, the fixation technique has significant influence on the forces applied to the plate and affects the healing process. The failure investigation mainly included chemical analysis, metallography, hardness testing, as well as macroscopic and microscopic fractographic observations using stereomicroscope and scanning electron microscope, respectively. Based on the results of fractographic studies, fatigue fracture mechanism was identified as the primary cause of failure. Fatigue crack initiation was found to take place at relatively sharp corners around the designed central holes on the condylar <b>blade</b> <b>plates,</b> which acted as stress raisers on the reduced cross sections. Since prior to healing, the loads are primarily transferred through the plates, proper post-operative immobilization can be effective in preventing fatigue failure of the plates...|$|R

30|$|Reconstruction was {{performed}} with a nine-hole 95 ° angle <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> and cancellous bone graft. The patient {{was placed in}} a lateral decubitus position; through a lateral approach, the hip plate and the screws were removed, and the lateral aspect of femur and the non-union site were exposed. At the same time, autogenous bone for graft was harvested from the ipsilateral anterior iliac crest. The fracture site was found to be grossly unstable under the stress of abduction and adduction by manual testing. Fibrous tissue between fracture ends was removed by curettage, and a 60 -mm length angle <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> inserted into the original window for the previous hip plate supplemented with a 60 -mm cancellous screw in order to secure the proximal fragment. Following this, the non-union was reduced and the distal segment fixed to the shaft of the angle <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> through six screws (12 cortices). Finally, autogenous bone graft was packed around the fracture site. To prevent implant overloading, partial weight-bearing was not permitted until eight weeks following surgery.|$|E

SETTING: University Hospital Gasthuisberg, Leuven, Belgium. INTERVENTION: The AO 130 -degree <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> with an antirotation, 6. 5 -millimeter, partially threaded cancellous lag screw was used. RESULTS: Nineteen (63. 3 percent) patients had an excellent result, seven (23. 3 percent) had a good result, three (10 percent) had a fair result, and one (3. 3 percent) had a poor result. Delayed union was observed in one case, and avascular necrosis was observed in two cases. Two implants perforated the subchondral bone.

30|$|The {{advantages}} of the percutaneous osteotomy are self-evident: the quadriceps and periosteum are spared from dissection; the osteotomy hematoma is contained within a closed space, expediting the formation of callus; the surgical scars are minimal, without the keloid formation seen sometimes with <b>plates</b> or <b>blade</b> <b>plates</b> [8].|$|R

30|$|Several other osteotomies {{have also}} been described; {{examples}} include a “two level gap osteotomy” [21], the buttress AO plate lateral wedge osteotomy [21], the retrotubercle osteotomy [22, 23]. Plate and rigid internal fixation were applied in closed wedge osteotomies [24, 25]. Other fixation devices used in closed wedge osteotomies were: cannulated <b>blade</b> <b>plates</b> (Hippocrates), NexGen (Zimmer) osteotomy plate, Chambat plate, double plates, the “L” shaped buttress plate and cancellous/cortical screws, metal wires and the VCO Compression System [24, 26].|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to analyze {{patients}} treated with 95 Condylar <b>Blade</b> <b>Plate</b> and to describe the technique that can prevent complications. 69 patients with closed intertrochanteric femoral fractures were treated by one surgeon using the 95 Condylar <b>Blade</b> <b>Plate,</b> and it was found that 56 of them met the minimum 10 months follow up requirement. 53 patients (94 %) healed after the procedure. There were 4 patients (7 %) requiring surgical intervention. One patient required bipolar arthroplasty because of the cutting through of the implant, two patients needed repeated open reduction and internal fixation (ORIF) with bone graft due to delayed union and broken implant, and one patient had an infection which was resolved after debridement and a course of antibiotics. The surgical time averaged 45 minutes and blood loss averaged 150 ml.

30|$|The {{blade of}} the angle <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> offers good {{purchase}} of the proximal fragment and secures it under rotational and bending stresses. In addition, supplementary fixation with one cancellous screw helps. We chose a nine-hole 95 ° angle <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> for salvage surgery of the failed osteotomy because the longer shaft of this plate would provide greater purchase and stability of the distal fragment. This was borne by the mobility of the patient recovering to the pre-injury level within three months following our treatment and the non-union radiologically healed at 10 months after surgery. We recommend that distal fragments should be fixed with at least seven cortices {{for this type of}} osteotomy.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To compare {{clinical}} and radiological results in per- and subtrochanteric fractures' management with 90 degrees <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> or Gamma nail fixation; an implant allowing early weight-bearing and fracture healing in correct position remains still difficult.

The follow-up for all patients is 12 months. RESULTS: Gamma nail allows early weight-bearing in all patients, fracture healing is acquired at 4. 2 months; an operative diaphyseal fracture needed conversion to a long Gamma nail. We observed a slight cut-out that didn't need reoperation. In the <b>blade</b> <b>plate</b> group, we noticed three femoral head necrosis without major flattening, two non-unions, one plate's breakage and two malunions; fracture healing is acquired at 6. 3 months. The two non-unions and the plate's breakage didn't need reoperation because of low functional demand.

30|$|Distal femoral {{fractures}} {{are challenging}} injuries despite improvements of fixation techniques and plate designs.

Although no agreement exists on management of complex distal femoral fractures, the results reported by several authors [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 11, 22] suggest modern locking plates represent an advance for fixing different fracture patterns in this region. These include either high-energy fractures with severe bone comminution that may be further complicated through open injury, fractures in older people with poor bone quality and periprosthetic fractures.|$|R

30|$|It is {{reported}} in the literature that there is limited choice when selecting an implant that allows secure fixation of such a small proximal fragment of bone while achieving stable fixation of the osteotomy without violating the proximal femoral growth <b>plate.</b> Angled <b>blade</b> <b>plates</b> have been the standard devices used for fixation of proximal femoral osteotomies in children [10]. Nevertheless, there are problems with this technique; for example, the plate is not a suitable size for some children and considerable technical skill is required for its insertion. Experimental studies have indicated that the tension-band wiring fixation of the proximal femur, as proposed by Pauwels and adapted by Weber, could overcome these limitations and provide simple and stable fixation [11, 12]. External fixators have been used as an alternative to internal fixation in percutaneous subtrochanteric osteotomy, but the reported results include only limited follow-up [9], and there are potential risks of pin tract infection and loosening.|$|R

Implants for proximal femoral osteotomy may be required for internal fixation from approximately the age of 12  months to skeletal maturity and across a range of body weights, typically ranging from 10  kg to more than 120  kg. Historically, two-part devices were first used in proximal femoral osteotomy in children, derived from devices used for the fixation of proximal femoral fractures in adults [6].

30|$|The {{prevalence}} of scoliosis {{is high in}} children and adolescents with CP, particularly those who are classified at non-ambulant GMFCS levels IV and V [37]. The presence, severity and prior treatment of scoliosis and other deformities, such as kyphosis and lordosis, require clear documentation. In addition, although scoliotic curves progress most rapidly during the pubertal growth spurt, spinal deformities may continue to progress in young adults with CP even after skeletal maturity [38]. Therefore, appropriate advice regarding long-term follow-up of spinal issues is important. Although some of the adolescents leaving our service have had a spinal fusion and are on a stable plateau following successful surgery, others have smaller curves and have not yet progressed to surgery. The provision of serial Cobb angle measurements to indicate both the magnitude and progression of spinal deformity can be very useful to those providing ongoing care.

30|$|The {{purpose is}} to {{describe}} the technique and report the results and complications of percutaneous femoral rotational osteotomy, secured with a trochanteric-entry, locked intramedullary rod, in adolescents with femoral anteversion. Our series comprised an IRB approved, retrospective, consecutive series of 85 osteotomies (57 patients), followed to implant removal. The average age at surgery was 13.3  years (range 8.8 – 18.3) with a female-to-male ratio of 2.8 : 1. The minimum follow-up was 2  years. Eighty-three osteotomies healed primarily. Two patients, subsequently found to have vitamin D deficiency, broke screws and developed nonunions; both healed after repeat reaming and rod exchange and vitamin supplementation. Preoperative symptoms, including in-toeing gait, tripping and anterior knee pain or patellar instability, were resolved consistently. We did not observe significant growth disturbance or osteonecrosis. We noted a 12.5  % incidence of broken interlocking screws; this {{did not affect the}} correction or outcome except for the two patients mentioned above. This prompted a switch from a standard screw (core diameter =  3  mm) to a threaded bolt (core diameter =  3.7  mm).

40|$|Background: In this study, we {{reviewed}} {{the results of}} conventional osteosynthesis com-bined with strut onlay allografts and autogenous bone grafts as the treatment for nonunion of the femur. Methods: We conducted a retrospective study of 18 patients with nonunion of the femur treated with internal fixation (eight 95 ˚ fixed-angled <b>blade</b> <b>plates,</b> 7 intramedullary nails, 2 dynamic hip compression plates and screws, and 1 condylar buttress plate) and autogenous bone grafts and cortical strut allo-grafts. There were 1. 8 operations on average before surgery. The average time from the initial treatment of the fracture or osteotomy to surgery was 32. 5 months. The average follow-up was 32. 2 months. Results: All 18 nonunions had healed {{by the time of}} follow-up. Positive intraopera-tive cultures (Staphylococcus epidermidis) in 2 patients were resolved by parenteral antibiotics with no additional treatment. Removal of implants was required in 5 patients because of screw irritation or bony union. One con-comitant quadricepsplasty as well as 2 excisions of a protruding graft were required because of restricted knee motion or impingement. Conclusions: For difficult nonunions of the femur in the current study, strict adherence to the principles of the treatment of nonunion and the addition of strut allografts to enhance stability and repair potential proved to be a good alternative.

The robust design allows high tip-speed operation, and therefore this fan is often used in high-pressure applications.|$|R
