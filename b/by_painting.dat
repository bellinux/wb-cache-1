5|$|An {{equivalent}} active camouflage strategy, {{known to}} zoologists as counter-illumination, {{is used by}} many marine organisms, notably cephalopods such as the midwater squid, Abralia veranyi. The underside is covered with small photophores, organs that produce light. The squid varies {{the intensity of the}} light according to the brightness of the sea surface far above, providing effective camouflage <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> out the animal's silhouette with light.|$|E

The episode resulted in work that was so successful {{that none of the}} contestants were eliminated.|$|E
5|$|Until 1805, Dürenstein was {{probably}} {{best known as}} the village in which crusader Richard the Lionheart was held by LeopoldV, Duke of Austria. In 1741, during the War of the Austrian Succession, several hundred local villagers had held off the French and Bavarian armies, intent on capturing Vienna, <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> drain pipes to look like cannons, and beating on drums, thus suggesting the presence of a large force.|$|E

5|$|At {{around this}} time Etty began to receive many {{unsolicited}} letters from wealthy Old Etonian lawyer Thomas Myers. Myers was a huge admirer of Etty, and his letters mainly suggest literary topics he felt Etty ought to be painting so as {{to appeal to the}} nobility; he wrote regularly between July 1832 and May 1844. Although eccentric and largely incoherent (one of his suggestions was for Etty to raise his profile <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> nude portraits of the wives of the aristocracy), Etty appears to have taken at least some of Myers's suggestions seriously.|$|E
5|$|Cochrane {{prepared}} for {{an encounter with}} this Spanish vessel <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> Speedy to resemble a Danish brig then in the Mediterranean, the Clomer. He also appointed a Dane as quartermaster and found him a Danish naval officer's uniform. While cruising off Alicante on 21 December, Speedy encountered an enemy frigate, but tricked her into thinking she was a neutral vessel. Cochrane again used this false flag technique to his advantage; on 22January he was sailing with a convoy of Danish merchantmen under a Danish flag, pretending to escort them. When a 10-gun French ship and 8-gun Spanish brig approached, Cochrane hoisted British colours and attacked, capturing both of them.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of Cleopatra, {{over the next decade}} Etty tried to {{replicate}} its success <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. Between 1820 and 1829 Etty exhibited 15 paintings, of which 14 depicted nude figures. While some nude paintings by foreign artists existed in private collections, England had no tradition of nude painting and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. Etty was the first British artist to specialise in the nude, and although his portraits of male nudes were generally well received, many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as indecent.|$|E

5|$|In 1821 the Royal Academy {{accepted}} and exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, {{and many of}} Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable.

5|$|Irish {{merchant}} shipping {{saw to it}} that vital imports continued to arrive and exports, mainly food supplies to Great Britain, were delivered. Irish ships sailed unarmed and usually alone, identifying themselves as neutrals with bright lights and <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> the Irish tricolour and EIRE in large letters on their sides and decks. Nonetheless twenty percent of seamen serving in Irish ships perished, victims of a war not their own: attacked by both sides, though predominantly by the Axis powers. Often, Allied convoys could not stop to pick up survivors, while Irish ships always answered SOS signals and stopped to rescue survivors, irrespective of which side they belonged to. Irish ships rescued 534 seamen.|$|E
5|$|Light {{guns were}} {{suppressed}} {{for a time}} in the United States after the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and its attendant controversy over video games and gun crime. Since the late 1980s light gun controllers have been generally manufactured to look like toys <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> them in bright colours. In Japan, which lacks the gun crime found in the United States and in which civilians cannot legally own guns, more realistic light guns are widely available.|$|E
5|$|The Transfiguration was a {{major theme}} in Eastern Christian art, and every Eastern Orthodox monk who had trained in icon {{painting}} had to prove his craft <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> an icon depicting it. Icons receive the external marks of veneration, such as kisses and prostration, and they {{are thought to be}} powerful channels of divine grace. The Renaissance brought forth a number of artists who focused on depictions of Jesus; Fra Angelico and others followed Giotto in the systematic development of uncluttered images.|$|E

5|$|The {{conservation}} {{was carried}} out between 1974 and 1986, wherever possible using non-invasive procedures such as washing with water and a solution of lime, filling gaps and damaged surfaces with soft mortar to prevent the ingress of water and stabilising statues that were fracturing because of the corrosion of metal dowels. The surfaces were finished <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> with a thin coat of mortar and silane to resist further erosion and attack by pollutants. The restoration of the façade revealed much paint adhering to the statues and their niches, indicating that it had once been brightly coloured.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage for {{aircraft}} {{is complicated by}} the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not do fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage.|$|E
5|$|Famous {{painters}} included Ni Zan and Dong Qichang, {{as well as}} the Four Masters of the Ming dynasty, Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, and Qiu Ying. They drew {{upon the}} techniques, styles, and complexity in painting achieved by their Song and Yuan predecessors, but added techniques and styles. Well-known Ming artists could make a living simply <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> due to the high prices they demanded for their artworks and the great demand by the highly cultured community to collect precious works of art. The artist Qiu Ying was once paid 2.8kg (100oz) of silver to paint a long handscroll for the eightieth birthday celebration of the mother of a wealthy patron. Renowned artists often gathered an entourage of followers, some who were amateurs who painted while pursuing an official career and others who were full-time painters.|$|E

5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; the figures of Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
5|$|The German navy put little {{emphasis}} on camouflage. After the Battle of Jutland, German naval effort {{in any case}} went into submarine warfare. However, Germany made use of disguise, such as <b>by</b> <b>painting</b> ships in the colour schemes of British or neutral shipping. For example, the Kronprinzessin Cecilie was painted to resemble the British liner Olympic, and managed to reach America, evading the British blockade in 1914. In 1915 and 1916, the Germans further made use of commerce raiders, converted freighters with hidden weapons and long range, able to slip through the British blockade and then attack shipping {{as far away as}} the south Atlantic. German First World War merchant ships were rarely camouflaged, nor did they use Q-ships, as the Allied navies did not attack merchant shipping.|$|E
