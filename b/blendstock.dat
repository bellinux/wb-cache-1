No one knows precisely where or in what volume ethanol is being blended with gasoline and this has important implications for motor fuels markets: Because refiners cannot perfectly predict where ethanol will be blended with finished gasoline by wholesalers, they cannot know when to produce and where to ship a <b>blendstock</b> that when mixed with ethanol at 10 % would create the most economically efficient finished motor gasoline that meets engine standards and has comparable evaporative emissions as conventional gasoline without ethanol blending. In contrast to previous empirical analyses of biofuels that have relied on highly aggregated data, our analysis is disaggregated to the level of individual wholesale fuel terminals or racks (of which there are about 350 in the US). We incorporate the price of ethanol as well as the <b>blendstock</b> price to model the wholesaler's decision of whether or not to blend additional ethanol into gasoline at any particular wholesale city-terminal.

Within NARA, Gevo has developed the lignocellulosic fermentation process, and independently from NARA developed isobutanol recovery technology. Gevo separately advanced chemical technology to convert isobutanol through a patented process (dehydration, oligomerization, hydrogenation, and fractionation) into Alcohol-to-Jet (ATJ) Jet Fuel <b>blendstock.</b> Gevo worked for over eight years with ASTM, a worldwide standards organization that develops and publishes voluntary consensus technical standards, to introduce Gevo’s ATJ technology into the specification D 7566 “Standard Specification for Aviation Turbine Fuel Containing Synthesized Hydrocarbons”.

Fuel {{research octane number}} (RON), octane sensitivity and ethanol content (derived from sugarcane and corn) were varied in the simulations to formulate blended fuels that economically achieve target specifications. The well-to-pump (WTP) simulation results were then analyzed to understand the effects of fuel composition on emission. Elevated ethanol content displaces aromatics and olefins required in gasoline <b>blendstock</b> to reach a target fuel specification. The addition of greater sugarcane-based ethanol percentage in constant aromatics and olefins fuel reduces its WTP CO 2 emission.
