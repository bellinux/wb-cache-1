5|$|In 1987, {{the school}} {{reached its peak}} {{attendance}} with 35,945 students, resulting in SDSU being the largest university in California and 10th in the nation. Due to the overwhelming number of students and available facilities and majors, the California State University Board of Trustees decided to limit enrollment to 33,000. However, in 1993, enrollment dropped to 26,800, the lowest attendance since 1973 {{as a result of}} the <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> of 1991.|$|E
5|$|Litter {{accumulation}} is {{a perennial}} {{problem in the}} subway system. In the 1970s and 1980s, dirty trains and platforms, as well as graffiti were a serious problem. The situation had improved since then, but the 2010 <b>budget</b> <b>crisis,</b> which caused over 100 of the cleaning staff to lose their jobs, threatened to curtail trash removal from the subway system. Every day, the MTA removes 40 tons of trash from 3,500 trash receptacles.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of closure due to the Pawnee <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> and {{government}} shutdown, Leslie (Amy Poehler) excitedly informs her fellow employees that the parks department has been reopened, although on a shoestring budget. State auditors Chris (Rob Lowe) and Ben (Adam Scott) announce they may only conduct existing park maintenance, but Leslie wants to offer better programs and services. Meanwhile, the always-optimistic Chris continues trying to convince Ann (Rashida Jones) {{to go on a}} date with him. Ann finds him too intense, but Leslie convinces her to accept a date and try to persuade Chris to increase the parks budget.|$|E
50|$|On May 11, 2011, {{state park}} {{officials}} announced that seventy parks would be closed due to department budget cuts {{in response to}} California's continuing <b>budget</b> <b>crises.</b>|$|R
50|$|Because {{software}} development may involve compromising or going {{beyond what is}} required by the client, a {{software development}} project may stray into less technical concerns such as human resources, risk management, intellectual property, <b>budgeting,</b> <b>crisis</b> management, etc. These processes may also cause the role of business development to overlap with software development.|$|R
5000|$|Oregon {{has been}} plagued with <b>budget</b> <b>crises</b> since the passage of Measure 47 in 1996. Since then, the state has been working to reign in {{spending}} and work for a balanced budget, but it's come at the severe expense of important programs, such as education. Other options must {{be on the table}} and Measure 47 removes those options.|$|R
5|$|However, {{fulfilling}} these promises proves {{costly and}} Mayor Quimby denounces Homer for spending the department's yearly budget {{in only a}} month. Homer gets cities all over the United States to pay him to store their excess garbage into an abandoned mine shaft {{on the outskirts of}} Springfield. Despite the <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> having ended and the workers receiving their salaries as promised, the garbage builds up underground and eventually erupts, pouring trash all over the town. At a town hall meeting, Homer is fired from his post and replaced with Ray Patterson, who declines reinstatement. With no other options left, Quimby moves the entire town five miles down the road.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Ann fears {{she made}} out with {{someone at the}} party but cannot remember. She {{eventually}} learns she made out with Chris, who shows a romantic interest in her. Tom returns to the Snakehole Lounge to close his tab, where he meets the bartender, Lucy (Natalie Morales), who makes fun of his efforts to pick up women. The two get along and Lucy gives Tom her phone number, to his immense pleasure. Leslie decides to apologize to Ben, and he invites her out for a beer. As they finally start to get along, Leslie realizes Ben was the mayor {{of a small town}} called Partridge, Minnesota. It was national news because he was only 18 when elected, and he promptly drove the entire government into the ground. Ben became a state auditor to prove he can be responsible and restart his political career. Later, at the parks department budget meeting, Chris and Ben reveal Pawnee's <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> was far worse than previously thought and that the Pawnee government will shut down until further notice, horrifying Leslie and delighting Ron.|$|E
25|$|In early April 2009, the Georgia General Assembly {{created a}} <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> for MARTA {{by failing to}} pass a bill that would allow it to access its own capital reserve account, in order to {{compensate}} for a severe drop in sales-tax revenue during the late-2000s recession. MARTA stated that this could force the agency to discontinue operations one day out of the week, possibly a weekday. The agency's <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> forced MARTA to lay off 700 employees. Service cuts and other budget-stabilizing measures began in fiscal year 2011, with the first affected service mark-up in September 2010. Governor Sonny Perdue refused to call a special session as requested, and did not issue an executive order as he stated it would not be legal to do so.|$|E

50|$|Galligan assumed {{his office}} as Mayor of Jeffersonville on January 1, 2008 {{following}} his successful campaign {{for his third}} term. Galligan attended a five-day National League of Cities conference in New Orleans in December prior to officially becoming mayor. This incident would later become questioned by local citizens because of the excessive personal expenses that were {{paid for by the}} city, in the time of a <b>budgeting</b> <b>crisis.</b>|$|R
50|$|Robert Platshorn and Robert Meinster {{moved to}} Miami {{to get in}} on the lucrative {{marijuana}} business. They started to smuggle small loads from Colombia to the U.S. and used the Fontainebleau Hotel for their base of operations.

25|$|The <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> {{eventually}} led Standard & Poor's to downgrade Michigan's credit rating from AA to AA-. Additionally, the crisis contributed to sinking approval ratings for Granholm, which went from 43percent in August 2007 {{to a low}} of 32percent in December 2007. She had one of the lowest approval ratings for any governor in the United States.|$|E
25|$|As of 2008, {{the parade}} cost the city over $1 million each year, {{including}} $750,000 for police and parade services and $360,000 in prize money. The 2008 <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> led {{the city to}} propose closing numerous libraries and firehouses and the scaling back of expenditures for the parade, offering $300,000 for the 2009 parade and nothing for 2010.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} Lithuania faced a severe <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> – in 1919 its revenue was 72 million while {{expenses}} reached 190 million German marks. While {{the government was}} struggling to obtain financial assistance and loans, deep cuts affected the army. Instead of increasing its armed forces to 40,000 men, Lithuania was forced to cut them to about 25,000.|$|E
5000|$|An 18-hole golf course, {{which had}} been {{constructed}} in 1972, was closed {{at the end of}} November 2015 in response to the statewide parks <b>budgeting</b> <b>crisis</b> which saw the closing or curtailment of services at several Alabama state parks. In announcing the shutdown, state parks director Gregory M. Lein said an attempt had been made to find a concessionaire to take charge of golf course operations but that no takers had come forward.|$|R
5000|$|NCLB’s {{main focus}} is on skills in reading, writing, and mathematics, which are areas related to {{economic}} success. Combined with the <b>budget</b> <b>crises</b> in the late-2000s recession, some schools have cut or eliminated classes and resources for many subject areas that {{are not part of}} NCLB's accountability standards. [...] Since 2007, almost 71% of schools have reduced instruction time in subjects such as history, arts, language, and music to provide more time and resources to mathematics and English.|$|R

25|$|Connecticut's {{dependence}} on the defense industry posed an economic challenge {{at the end of}} the Cold War. The resulting <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> helped elect Lowell Weicker as governor on a third-party ticket in 1990. Weicker's remedy was a state income tax which proved effective in balancing the budget, but only for the short-term. He did not run for a second term, in part because of this politically unpopular move.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 2010, the QBx1 {{was split}} into the Q50 Limited and Bx23 routes, {{simplifying}} the many service {{patterns of the}} former QBx1 route, but eliminating direct service between Pelham Bay and the individual sections of Co-op City. In addition, the changes were made in conjunction with controversial cuts in service to other Co-op City routes during the MTA's 2010 <b>budget</b> <b>crisis,</b> and received negative input from the community.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{the library}} opened {{part-time}} {{for a month}} in early 1972, it did not open officially until December 5, 1972, aided by federal revenue sharing funds. <b>Budget</b> <b>crises</b> affected the library through the 1970s and early 1980s, and Capitol Hill sometimes operated on reduced hours and book budgets through 1984. In that year, voters approved a three-year serial levy (tax) to help fund the library system. Subsequent temporary levies supported the system through November 2012, when voters approved a permanent levy.|$|R

He {{called for an}} increase in services for individuals who are homeless and individuals with addictions. Nahem called the District's public schools [...] "miserable" [...] and [...] "segregated". Nahem called for increasing taxes on wealthy individuals in order to fund increased help for working people. Nahem said the Socialist Workers Party could unite people of all races, genders, and ages.|$|R
25|$|On {{top of the}} <b>budget</b> <b>crisis,</b> Bush {{started his}} presidential tenure as the Savings and Loans {{industry}} was collapsing. The {{federal and state governments}} had deregulated the industry in the late 1970s and early 1980s, and the industry ventured into riskier investments that destabilized it. The collapse of the Savings and Loans and the subsequent government bailout only added to the difficult financial environment that Bush confronted during his presidency.|$|E
25|$|Rendell drew some {{criticism}} following a late January 2009 preview of his budget {{proposal that would}} eliminate 100 budget line items, including {{programs such as the}} Pennsylvania Governor's Schools of Excellence and Drug Abuse Resistance Education ("D.A.R.E."). These program cuts are part of Rendell's proposal to cut state expenditures to a level 1 percent below the 2002-2003 budget in response to an expected 2.3 billion dollar budget shortfall. As a result of the <b>budget</b> <b>crisis,</b> Rendell spokesman Chuck Ardo resigned.|$|E
25|$|On 4 May, Acevedo Vilá marched from La Fortaleza, the Governor's house, to the Capitol. It was {{the first}} time in Puerto Rican history that such an event has happened. In Puerto Rican custom, the Governor walks from the Capitol to La Fortaleza when he takes the oath of office. Acevedo Vilá was criticized due to the {{similarities}} between this march and an episode of the TV series The West Wing, in which the President of the United States (portrayed by Martin Sheen) walks from the White House, home of the President, to the U.S. Capitol, home of the U.S. Congress, in order to resolve a federal <b>budget</b> <b>crisis.</b>|$|E

One suggestion was that the new vehicle would be built in Europe and carry a mix of European and U.S. instruments. NASA would provide the rocket to deliver it to Mars and provide the sky crane landing system. Despite the proposed reorganisation, {{the goals of the}} 2018 mission opportunity would have stayed broadly the same.|$|R
50|$|Morrison ran for {{governor}} of Connecticut in 1990. The incumbent Democratic Governor, William O'Neill, had become very unpopular due to years of state <b>budget</b> <b>crises</b> and chose not to seek re-election. Although he defeated William Cibes in the Democratic primary, he finished a distant third in the general despite a sizable Democratic voter registration advantage, behind Republican John G. Rowland and the eventual winner, Independent Lowell Weicker. Morrison could not overcome public dissatisfaction with the Democrats. After losing, he started his own law firm specializing in immigration law in New Haven, Connecticut.|$|R

25|$|The {{sale of the}} Roseton and Danskammer plants—a {{condition}} of Dynegy's emergence from bankruptcy—proceeded slowly. On November 8, 2012, members of International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW) Local 320 struck the Roseton and Danskammer plants after a contract extension expired and Dynegy continued to seek cuts in retirement benefits. Dynegy's bankruptcy also left $17 million in unpaid property taxes in Dutchess County, New York. This created a <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> in the county which threatened to close local schools and create severe cutbacks in county services. On December 10, 2012, Dynegy announced it would sell the Roseton plant to Louis Dreyfus Highbridge Energy for $19.5 million in cash. The sale closed on April 30, 2013.|$|E
25|$|The William Allen High School {{offers a}} dual {{enrollment}} program. This state program permits {{high school students}} to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. Students remain enrolled at their high school. The courses count towards high school graduation requirements and towards earning a college degree. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offered a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. Under state rules, other students that reside in the district, who attend a private school, a charter school or are homeschooled are eligible to participate in this program. In 2010, Governor Edward Rendell eliminated the grants to students, from the Commonwealth, due to a state <b>budget</b> <b>crisis.</b>|$|E
25|$|The second {{election}} of December 1910 changed everything to Redmond's advantage, giving his parliamentary party {{the balance of}} power at Westminster, which marked a high point in his political career. His deal over the <b>budget</b> <b>crisis</b> of 1909 led to the curbing {{of the power of the}} House of Lords, which had previously blocked the budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, David Lloyd George. With the Lords' veto abolished under the Parliament Act 1911, Irish Home Rule (which the Lords blocked in 1894) became a reality. Redmond used his leverage to persuade the Liberal government of H. H. Asquith to introduced the Third Home Rule Bill in April 1912, to grant Ireland national self-government. This could no longer be blocked by the Lords, its enactment merely delayed for two years. Home Rule had reached the pinnacle of its success and Redmond had gone much further than any of his predecessors in shaping British politics to the needs of the Irish.|$|E
40|$|Government <b>budget</b> <b>crises</b> have {{compelled}} state Extension Services {{to defend}} their receipt of state and county funding. A key to that defense is persuading citizens and policymakers of Extension's "public value": the benefit from Extension programs {{to those who are}} not directly served. This paper uses the principles of public sector economics to help formulate that defense and describes how Extension staff have applied economic principles to identify the public value in their own programs. The approach, developed into a workshop for program teams, serves to both sustain programs that have strong public value and identify programs that do not.
