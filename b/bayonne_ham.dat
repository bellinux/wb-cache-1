50|$|There is a Museum of Ham in Arzacq which {{traces the}} history of <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham.</b>|$|E
50|$|Once the ham has {{completed}} its curing process it is {{marked with the}} traditional Basque Cross or Lauburu, topped with the name <b>Bayonne.</b> The <b>ham</b> is a minimum of 7 months old, with most being 9 or 10 months before it is offered for sale, and it will keep for up to another year if kept in a cool (8 °C), dry atmosphere.|$|R
60|$|On that Side of the River {{where the}} new Citadel is built, at a very little {{distance}} lies Pont d' Esprit, a Place mostly inhabited by Jews, who drive a great Trade there, and are esteemed very rich, tho' as in all other Countries mostly very rogueish. Here the Queen Dowager of Spain has kept her Court ever since the Jealousy of the present King reclus'd her from Madrid. As Aunt to his Competitor Charles (now Emperor) he apprehended her Intrigueing; for which Reason giving her an Option of Retreat, that Princess made choice of this City, much to the Advantage of the Place, and in all Appearance much to her own Satisfaction. She is a Lady not of the lesser Size; and lives here in suitable Splendour, and not without the Respect due to a Person of her high Quality: Every time she goes to take the Air, the Cannon of the Citadel saluting her, as she passes over the Bridge; and to say Truth, the Country round is extremely pleasant, and abounds in plenty of all Provisions; especially in wild Fowl. <b>Bayonne</b> <b>Hams</b> are, to a Proverb, celebrated all over France.|$|R

[...] 550 Beeves, at his touch, at once to jelly turn, And the huge boar is shrunk into an urn: The board with specious miracles he loads,[442] Turns hares to larks, and pigeons into toads. Another (for in all what one can shine?) Explains the séve and verdeur of the vine.[443] What cannot copious {{sacrifice}} atone? Thy truffles, Perigord! thy <b>hams,</b> <b>Bayonne!</b> With French libation, and Italian strain, Wash Bladen white, and expiate Hays's stain.[444] [...] 560 Knight lifts the head; for what are crowds undone To three essential partridges in one? Gone every blush, and silent all reproach, Contending princes mount them in their coach.|$|R

50|$|The commune {{is part of}} the Appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) zone of Ossau-iraty and has {{protected}} {{geographical indications}} (PGI) namely: Tarbais haricots, Tomme des Pyrénées, Duck foie gras of the South-west, and <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays it is eaten with txistorra (a type of thin chorizo) while {{drinking}} txakoli. It {{can also}} be eaten with fried pancetta ( [...] in Basque xingar, in French Ventrêche) or fried <b>Bayonne</b> <b>Ham,</b> cheese like Ossau-Iraty, chocolate or honey.|$|E
50|$|The area {{concerned}} is the basin {{of the river}} Adour and this geographical limitation is now enshrined in the regulations {{for the production of}} <b>Bayonne</b> <b>Ham.</b> The meat itself does not have to come from the Adour basin but has to be produced from one of eight clearly defined breeds of pig reared in an area from Deux Sèvres in the north to Aveyron and the Aude. The regulations are very strict and cover the zone of origin of the pork, the regime for feeding the animals (no steroids, no fish oils, no antibiotics), and each animal must be clearly and uniquely identifiable with a tattoo. Transport, slaughter, size and weight of the original meat cut, minimum fat cover, lanolic acid content, and the post slaughter storage temperature for the meat are all specified. The ham produced within these criteria is given the European Union PGI status Protected Designation of Origin (allows nitrite content) and as such is called <b>Bayonne</b> <b>Ham.</b> Enforcement of these regulations and the granting of the right to use the name <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham</b> is the responsibility of Le Consortium de Jambon du Bayonne based in Pau, the capital of Department 64 in southwest France.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bayonne</b> <b>Ham</b> or Jambon de Bayonne is a cured ham {{that takes}} {{its name from}} the ancient port city of Bayonne in the far South West of France, a city located in both the {{cultural}} regions of Basque Country and Gascony. Jambon de Bayonne has PGI status.|$|E
50|$|Tromb-al-ca-zar was premiered in the Théâtre des Bouffes-Parisiens, Salle Choiseul in Paris, {{preceded by}} two cantatas by Offenbach, Le Berceau and La Paix du monde. Successful numbers {{such as the}} bolero for Hortense Schneider and the song about <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham,</b> made the work popular along with the in-jokes, despite the thin plot; it was revived at the Bouffes-Parisiens for several years afterwards.|$|E
50|$|Espelette {{is known}} for its dried red peppers, used whole or ground to a hot powder, used in the {{production}} of <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham.</b> The peppers are designated as Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée and are hung to dry outside many of the houses and shops in the village during the summer. The peppers are sold in the town's Wednesday covered market and are honoured in a festival on the last Sunday in October.|$|E
50|$|Bayonne {{is known}} for its fine chocolates, {{produced}} in the town for 500 years, and <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham,</b> a cured ham seasoned with peppers from nearby Espelette. Izarra, the liqueur made in bright green or yellow colours, is distilled locally. It is said by some that Bayonne is the birthplace of mayonnaise, supposedly a corruption of Bayonnaise, the French adjective describing the city's people and produce. Now bayonnaise can refer to a particular mayonnaise flavoured with the Espelette chillis.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the breed}} is {{preserved}} by small farmers in France and Spain who {{are dedicated to}} traditional Basque foods. Basque pigs grow more slowly and develop more fat than modern breeds like the Large White, making them less well-suited to intensive commercial meat production, but ideal {{for the creation of}} cured pork products such as <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham.</b> Basque sows have smallish litters of about nine young, but have a strong maternal instinct and are good mothers.|$|E
50|$|Château d’Orion is {{a typical}} Béarnaise manor house which has been {{enlarged}} and extended over the years. In 2003, the house was completely renovated preserving many original features and furnishings and these can be seen throughout the whole year. Originally built as an abbaye laique, from the 17th century to the French Revolution the former owners of the château, the Casamayor family, looked after the nearby church. Following them the family of Jean-Ninon Larrouy bought the property; their wealth was based on trading the famous <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham.</b>|$|E
50|$|Uncertainty exists {{around the}} birth of du Casse. Though he is usually {{said to have been}} born on August 2, 1646 in Saubusse, near Dax (Landes), the son of Bertrand Ducasse, a <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham</b> merchant, and Marguerite de Lavigne, he was {{actually}} born in Pau to Jacques Ducasse and Judith Remy. His father Jacques was the son of Gaillard Ducasse, a minister in the Reformed Church of France, which designated the family as Huguenots. Because Huguenots were persecuted at this time in France, and their career prospects were limited, it is thought that du Casse forged his baptismal record to hide his Huguenot and ignoble background. Early biographers, including his grand-nephew and Saint-Simon, perpetuated this error in their works.|$|E
5000|$|Pig farming, which {{represents}} {{a significant part}} of the agri-food sector is distributed throughout the region (regional races: black ass Limousin, Gascon pork pie black Basque) and is guaranteed by the label [...] "porc du Sud-Ouest [...] ". The pigs in the region are used to produce many meat products, starting with the famous <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham.</b> Many farms have also specialized in poultry production including yellow chicken Saint-Sever and poultry of Sèvres val (regional races Barbezieux, Limousin, Gascony, Landes and Marans) and fat waterfowl (mule ducks and geese), primarily designed for the production of foie gras and confit. Nouvelle-Aquitaine is the first European region in terms of foie gras (more than half the French production). The label [...] "Canard à foie gras du Sud-Ouest" [...] occupies a large part of the region.|$|E
5000|$|In the {{restaurant}} on the Rue Saint-Augustin, Parisian actor and gourmand Yves Mirande would dazzle his juniors, French and American, by dispatching a lunch of raw <b>Bayonne</b> <b>ham</b> and fresh figs, a hot sausage in crust, spindles of filleted pike in a rich rose sauce Nantua, a leg of lamb larded with anchovies, artichokes on a pedestal of foie gras, and four or five kinds of cheese, with a good bottle of Bordeaux and one of champagne, after which he would call for the Armagnac and remind Madame to have ready for dinner the larks and ortolans she had promised him, with a few langoustes and a turbot — and, of course, a fine civet made from the marcassin, or young wild boar, that the lover of the leading lady in his current production had sent up from his estate in the Sologne. [...] "And while I think of it," [...] I once heard him say, [...] "we haven't had any woodcock for days, or truffles baked in the ashes, and the cellar is becoming a disgrace — no more '34s and hardly any '37s. Last week, I had to offer my publisher a bottle that was far too good for him, simply {{because there was nothing}} between the insulting and the superlative." ...|$|E
