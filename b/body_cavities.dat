5|$|Members of {{this small}} group have either a single divided sucker or a row of suckers that cover the underside. They infest the guts of bony or {{cartilaginous}} fish and of turtles, and the <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> of marine and freshwater bivalves and gastropods. Their eggs produce ciliated swimming larvae, and the life cycle has one or two hosts.|$|E
5|$|Some species live separately, in {{vertical}} tubes {{embedded in}} soft sediment, while others form tangled masses buried in or encrusting rocks and shells. In some habitats populations of phoronids reach tens of thousand of individuals per square meter. The actinotroch larvae are familiar among plankton, and sometimes {{account for a}} significant proportion of the zooplankton biomass. Predators include fish, gastropods (snails), and nematodes (tiny roundworms). One phoronid species is unpalatable to many epibenthic predators. Various parasites infest phoronids' <b>body</b> <b>cavities,</b> digestive tract and tentacles. It is unknown whether phoronids have any significance for humans. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has not listed any phoronid species as endangered.|$|E
5|$|Like other insects, {{grasshoppers}} {{have an open}} {{circulatory system}} and their <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> are filled with haemolymph. A heart-like structure in {{the upper part of}} the abdomen pumps the fluid to the head from where it percolates past the tissues and organs on its way back to the abdomen. This system circulates nutrients throughout the body and carries metabolic wastes to be excreted into the gut. Other functions of the haemolymph include wound healing, heat transfer and the provision of hydrostatic pressure, but the circulatory system is not involved in gaseous exchange. Respiration is performed using tracheae, air-filled tubes, which open at the surfaces of the thorax and abdomen through pairs of valved spiracles. Larger insects may need to actively ventilate their bodies by opening some spiracles while others remain closed, using abdominal muscles to expand and contract the body and pump air through the system.|$|E
50|$|A <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> is any fluid-filled {{space in}} a {{multicellular}} organism other than those of vessels (such as blood vessels and lymph vessels). The human <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> normally refers to the ventral <b>body</b> <b>cavity,</b> because it {{is by far the}} largest.|$|R
50|$|In some protostomes, the {{embryonic}} blastocoele persists as a <b>body</b> <b>cavity.</b> These protostomes have a fluid filled main <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> unlined or partially {{lined with}} tissue derived from mesoderm.|$|R
50|$|The {{concept of}} a surgically {{implanted}} improvised explosive device (SIIED) {{is derived from the}} <b>Body</b> <b>Cavity</b> Bomb (BCB) concept enunciated by Dr. Robert J. Bunker, a research associate at the Terrorism Research Center. Bunker's work for the last few years, has been on assessing the potential use of <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> bombs (BCB) or <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> suicide bombs (BCSB) as a variation of suicide bombing tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs).|$|R
5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would then have been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> would then have been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|When a {{mosquito}} carrying dengue virus bites a person, the virus enters the skin {{together with the}} mosquito's saliva. It binds to and enters white blood cells, and reproduces inside the cells while they move throughout the body. The white blood cells respond by producing a number of signaling proteins, such as cytokines and interferons, which are responsible {{for many of the}} symptoms, such as the fever, the flu-like symptoms, and the severe pains. In severe infection, the virus production inside the body is greatly increased, and many more organs (such as the liver and the bone marrow) can be affected. Fluid from the bloodstream leaks through the wall of small blood vessels into <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> due to capillary permeability. As a result, less blood circulates in the blood vessels, and the blood pressure becomes so low that it cannot supply sufficient blood to vital organs. Furthermore, dysfunction of the bone marrow due to infection of the stromal cells leads to reduced numbers of platelets, which are necessary for effective blood clotting; this increases the risk of bleeding, the other major complication of dengue fever.|$|E

25|$|The {{spread of}} a {{malignancy}} into <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> can occur via penetrating {{the surface of}} the peritoneal, pleural, pericardial, or subarachnoid spaces. For example, ovarian tumors can spread transperitoneally to {{the surface of the}} liver.|$|E
25|$|Echocardiography {{can help}} detect cardiomyopathies, such as hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, dilated cardiomyopathy, and many others. The use of stress {{echocardiography}} {{may also help}} determine whether any chest pain or associated symptoms are related to heart disease. The biggest advantage to echocardiography {{is that it is}} not invasive (does not involve breaking the skin or entering <b>body</b> <b>cavities)</b> and has no known risks or side effects.|$|E

On the basis of numerous reports of such burns, including burns to children, topical use of raw garlic, as well as insertion of raw garlic into <b>body</b> <b>cavities,</b> is discouraged. In particular, topical application of raw garlic to young children is not advisable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries, light was guided through bent glass rods to {{illuminate}} <b>body</b> <b>cavities.</b> Practical {{applications such as}} close internal illumination during dentistry appeared early in the twentieth century. Image transmission through tubes was demonstrated independently by the radio experimenter Clarence Hansell and the television pioneer John Logie Baird in the 1920s. In the 1930s, Heinrich Lamm showed that one could transmit images through a bundle of unclad optical fibers and used it for internal medical examinations, but his work was largely forgotten.|$|E
25|$|Scavengers and {{carnivores}} such as wolves, dogs, cats, beetles, {{and other}} insects feeding on {{the remains of}} a carcass can make determining the time of insect colonization much harder. This is because the decomposition process has been interrupted by factors that may speed up decomposition. Corpses with open wounds, whether pre or post mortem, tend to decompose faster due to easier insect access. The cause of death likewise can leave openings in the body that allow insects and bacteria access to the inside <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> in earlier stages of decay. Flies oviposit eggs inside natural openings and wounds that may become exaggerated when the eggs hatch and the larvae begin feeding.|$|E

25|$|Ernie Ball Music Man {{improved}} their visibility in the guitar {{market with a}} succession of new guitar models, largely player-endorsed, including the Silhouette (1986), Steve Morse Signature (1987), Eddie Van Halen Signature/Axis model (1990), Albert Lee Signature (1993), Steve Lukather Signature (1993), the John Petrucci 6 & 7-string guitars (1999). They also introduced a series of new electric bass models, including the StingRay 5 (1987), the Sterling Bass (1993) and the Bongo Bass (2003) (the futuristic look of which was designed {{in conjunction with the}} BMW DesignworksUSA team). While none of these could compete against Fender or Gibson on sales figures, Music Man outpaced the competition by making 'players' guitars with quick change pickup assemblies, Teflon coated truss-rods, low noise pickup designs, piezo bridge pickups, 5 and 6 bolt necks, sculpted neck joints, graphite acrylic resin coated <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> and most importantly, consistently high quality fit and finish.|$|E
500|$|Because they do {{not have}} {{internal}} <b>body</b> <b>cavities,</b> Platyhelminthes were regarded as a primitive stage in the evolution of bilaterians (animals with bilateral symmetry and hence with distinct front and rear ends). However, analyses since the mid-1980s have separated out one subgroup, the Acoelomorpha, as basal bilaterians—closer to the original bilaterians than to any other modern groups. The remaining Platyhelminthes form a monophyletic group, one that contains all and only descendants of a common ancestor that is itself a member of the group. The redefined Platyhelminthes is part of the Lophotrochozoa, one of the three main groups of more complex bilaterians. These analyses had concluded the redefined Platyhelminthes, excluding Acoelomorpha, consists of two monophyletic subgroups, Catenulida and Rhabditophora, with Cestoda, Trematoda and Monogenea forming a monophyletic subgroup within one branch of the Rhabditophora. Hence, the traditional platyhelminth subgroup [...] "Turbellaria" [...] is now regarded as paraphyletic, since it excludes the wholly parasitic groups, although these are descended from one group of [...] "turbellarians".|$|E
500|$|The {{next stage}} in {{development}} is a brachiolaria larva and involves the growth of three short, additional arms. These are [...] at the anterior end, surround a sucker and have adhesive cells at their tips. Both bipinnaria and brachiolaria larvae are bilaterally symmetrical. When fully developed, the brachiolaria settles on the seabed and attaches itself with a short stalk formed from the ventral arms and sucker. Metamorphosis now takes place with a radical rearrangement of tissues. The {{left side of the}} larval body becomes the oral surface of the juvenile and the right side the aboral surface. Part of the gut is retained but the mouth and anus move to new positions. Some of the <b>body</b> <b>cavities</b> degenerate but others become the water vascular system and the visceral coelom. The starfish is now pentaradially symmetrical. It casts off its stalk and becomes a free-living juvenile starfish about [...] in diameter. Starfish of the order Paxillosida have no brachiolaria stage, with the bipinnaria larvae settling on the seabed and developing directly into juveniles.|$|E

50|$|A {{mesentery}} is a membrane {{inside the}} <b>body</b> <b>cavity</b> of an animal. The term identifies different structures in different phyla: in vertebrates it {{is a double}} fold of the peritoneum enclosing the intestines; in other organisms it forms complete or incomplete partitions of the <b>body</b> <b>cavity,</b> whether that is the coelom or, as in the Anthozoa, the gastrovascular cavity.|$|R
50|$|Uniquely among echinoderms, crinoids have no madreporite. Instead, {{the oral}} surface is dotted within {{numerous}} minute ciliated funnels that {{run into the}} main <b>body</b> <b>cavity.</b> The ring canal has several small stone canals, located between {{the arms of the}} animal, but these open into the <b>body</b> <b>cavity,</b> and thus are only indirectly connected to the outside.|$|R
2500|$|Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (...) , {{also called}} by various other names, is a {{diagnostic}} endoscopic procedure that visualizes {{the upper part}} of the gastrointestinal tract down to the duodenum.

[...] The lifespan of heartworms is considerably shorter in cats, only two to three years, and most infections in cats do not have circulating microfilariae. [...] Cats {{are also more likely}} to have aberrant migration of heartworm larvae, resulting in infections in the brain or <b>body</b> <b>cavities.</b>|$|E
