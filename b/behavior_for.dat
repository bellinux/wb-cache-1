Sakurai's Object and V605 Aquilae have been observed experiencing born-again <b>behavior</b> <b>for</b> only 10 years, while FG Sagittae has undergone such <b>behavior</b> <b>for</b> 120 years.

5|$|As {{reflected}} in the table above, samarium halides change their crystal structures when one type of halide atoms is substituted for another, which is an uncommon <b>behavior</b> <b>for</b> most elements (e.g. actinides). Many halides have two major crystal phases for one composition, one being significantly more stable and another being metastable. The latter is formed upon compression or heating, followed by quenching to ambient conditions. For example, compressing the usual monoclinic samarium diiodide and releasing the pressure results in a PbCl2-type orthorhombic structure (density 5.90 g/cm3), and similar treatment results in a new phase of samarium triiodide (density 5.97 g/cm3).|$|E

50|$|The health belief model {{attempts}} to predict health-related <b>behaviors</b> by accounting <b>for</b> {{individual differences in}} beliefs and attitudes. However, it {{does not account for}} other factors that influence health <b>behaviors.</b> <b>For</b> instance, habitual health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking, seatbelt buckling) may become relatively independent of conscious health-related decision making processes. Additionally, individuals engage in some health-related <b>behaviors</b> <b>for</b> reasons unrelated to health (e.g., exercising for aesthetic reasons). Environmental factors outside an individual's control may prevent engagement in desired <b>behaviors.</b> <b>For</b> example, an individual living in a dangerous neighborhood may be unable to go for a jog outdoors due to safety concerns. Furthermore, the health belief model does not consider the impact of emotions on health-related behavior. Evidence suggests that fear may be a key factor in predicting health-related behavior.|$|R

5|$|A few spider {{species that}} build webs live {{together}} in large colonies and show social behavior, although not as complex as in social insects. Anelosimus eximius (in the family Theridiidae) can form colonies of up to 50,000 individuals. The genus Anelosimus has a strong tendency towards sociality: all known American species are social, and species in Madagascar are at least somewhat social. Members of other species {{in the same family}} but several different genera have independently developed social <b>behavior.</b> <b>For</b> example, although Theridion nigroannulatum belongs to a genus with no other social species, T. nigroannulatum build colonies that may contain several thousand individuals that co-operate in prey capture and share food. Other communal spiders include several Philoponella species (family Uloboridae), Agelena consociata (family Agelenidae) and Mallos gregalis (family Dictynidae). Social predatory spiders need to defend their prey against kleptoparasites ("thieves"), and larger colonies are more successful in this. The herbivorous spider Bagheera kiplingi lives in small colonies which help to protect eggs and spiderlings. Even widow spiders (genus Latrodectus), which are notoriously cannibalistic, have formed small colonies in captivity, sharing webs and feeding together.|$|E
5|$|The Javan {{rhinoceros}} is {{a solitary}} animal {{with the exception}} of breeding pairs and mothers with calves. They sometimes congregate in small groups at salt licks and mud wallows. Wallowing in mud is a common <b>behavior</b> <b>for</b> all rhinos; the activity allows them to maintain cool body temperatures and helps prevent disease and parasite infestation. The Javan rhinoceros does not generally dig its own mud wallows, preferring to use other animals' wallows or naturally occurring pits, which it will use its horn to enlarge. Salt licks are also very important because of the essential nutrients the rhino receives from the salt. Male home ranges are larger at ²) compared to the female, which are around ²). Male territories overlap each other less than those of the female. It is not known if there are territorial fights.|$|E

It is capable of displaying three square dots on the screen in monochrome black and white, with differing <b>behavior</b> <b>for</b> the dots depending on the game played, and with no sound capabilities.

5|$|Three group 3 {{elements}} occur naturally, scandium, yttrium, {{and either}} lanthanum or lutetium. Lanthanum continues the trend started by two lighter members in general chemical behavior, while lutetium behaves more similarly to yttrium. While {{the choice of}} lutetium would be {{in accordance with the}} trend for period 6 transition metals to behave more similarly to their upper periodic table neighbors, the choice of lanthanum is in accordance with the trends in the s-block, which the group 3 elements are chemically more similar to. They all are silvery-white metals under standard conditions. The fourth element, either actinium or lawrencium, has only radioactive isotopes. Actinium, which occurs only in trace amounts, continues the trend in chemical <b>behavior</b> <b>for</b> metals that form tripositive ions with a noble gas configuration; synthetic lawrencium is calculated and partially shown to be more similar to lutetium and yttrium. So far, no experiments have been conducted to synthesize any element that could be the next group 3 element. Unbiunium (Ubu), which could be considered a group 3 element if preceded by lanthanum and actinium, might be synthesized in the near future, it being only three spaces away from the current heaviest element known, oganesson.|$|E
