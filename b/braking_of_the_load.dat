50|$|Dual-mode {{cars have}} never been {{installed}} operationally, but the same system has seen some use {{as the basis for}} guided bus systems worldwide. These systems do not necessarily provide power as well as guidance, using conventionally powered buses. Experiments with hybrid systems on trams as a way of recovering power otherwise lost in <b>braking</b> (about 25% <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>load)</b> led to <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> using supercapacitors in place of batteries because they could handle the large currents being generated. This led to <b>the</b> idea <b>of</b> removing <b>the</b> overhead electric feeds for portions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tramways, using the hybrid to power the tram through these gaps - this allowed the often messy cable runs over road intersections to be removed, improving aesthetics. <b>The</b> two types <b>of</b> vehicle have recently converged in <b>the</b> form <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rubber wheeled tram, which uses tram-like overhead power and a single road-embedded rail as a guideway, a few <b>of</b> which allow <b>the</b> vehicle to leave the guide rail and operate as a traditional electric bus.|$|R
25|$|The railway on Lord Elgin's works, between Dunfermline and Limekilns in Fife, {{for design}} and execution, is {{inferior}} to none. On {{this line of}} railway there are two inclined planes, executed with all the requisite machinery, for <b>the</b> <b>loaded</b> waggons drawing up the empty ones; <b>the</b> longest <b>of</b> these is about 511 yards, with a declivity of about one in twenty. Between the two inclined planes, the ground had been originally nearly level to some extent: an ingenious advantage is taken of this level, by commencing, at {{a short distance from}} <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper inclined plane, and cutting out a track for a railway, with an easy slope in <b>the</b> line <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main descending railway for <b>the</b> <b>loaded</b> waggons, by banking up the earth, and facing it with a stone-wall; another railway is formed with a similar slope, but in a contrary direction, towards <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper inclined plane. In this manner the two railways are carried forward until they reach the top or bank-head <b>of</b> <b>the</b> under inclined plane, where <b>the</b> difference <b>of</b> perpendicular height between the two appears to be about 10 feet; <b>the</b> one-half <b>of</b> this height gives a declivity to <b>the</b> <b>loaded</b> waggons to proceed downwards; and the other half a declivity to the empty waggons, to proceed to <b>the</b> foot <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper inclined plane: <b>the</b> <b>brake</b> or drag <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>loaded</b> waggons has only to be attended to, for regulating their motion to the place where they start on the inclined plane.|$|R
5000|$|In France {{almost all}} station wagon models {{are called the}} Break (with a {{different}} spelling from the English shooting brake). French breaks from Peugeot and Citroën were available in seven- or eight-seater [...] "family" [...] versions long before MPVs became known in Europe. <b>The</b> break version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Citroën ID, introduced in 1958, was the first European model to offer the same size, style and luxury as an American full-size station wagon (prior to this breaks had been basic semi-commercial vehicles more like the American 'suburban'). The ID Break (known as the Safari in English-speaking countries) had the same eight-passenger seating arrangement as many American station wagons with two front-facing bench seats and two folding inward-facing seats in <b>the</b> <b>load</b> bed. <b>The</b> 'Familiale' version had a front bench seat, a forward-facing three-space bench seat {{in the middle and}} a folding forward-facing three-seat bench in the rear, providing a versatile nine-seater car. The Citroën also boasted an American-style two-part tailgate while its unique hydropneumatic suspension provided both self-levelling and automatic <b>brake</b> biasing regardless <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> carried. <b>The</b> car could also 'kneel' to the ground for easy loading of heavy or large items. The successors to the ID, the CX and XM, continued <b>the</b> tradition <b>of</b> offering some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest estate cars in Europe but the XM's replacement, the C6 was only produced as a saloon. The Peugeot 404, introduced in 1960, offered a conventional alternative to the innovative Citroëns for buyers wanting a large estate car. Its replacement, the 505 was available in both five-seat and seven-seat 'Familiale' versions. As with the Citroëns, changing demands in the French car market led to <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> <b>the</b> large Peugeot estate models in the mid-1990s, with the smaller and less versatile Peugeot 406 becoming the largest estate model in the range from 1995.|$|R

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} that a wagon driven by a {{squirrel-cage}} induction motor is controlled {{to stop at the}} given position on a rail. The wagon is driven on the rail and arrives at the brake-start point. From this point, the motor should be <b>braked</b> corresponding to <b>the</b> <b>load</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wagon. Therefore, the distance from brake-start point to the stop position must be constant. <b>The</b> <b>brake</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3 phase squirrel-cage induction motor is various method; dynamic braking, regenerative braking, plugging and single-phase braking etc. DC exciting method, so called dynamic braking, was used for this experiment. <b>The</b> peculiarity <b>of</b> this experiment is that <b>the</b> <b>load</b> was detected during the braking and braking current was decided. <b>The</b> method <b>of</b> this detection is as follows. At the first step, dynamic <b>braking</b> <b>of</b> which <b>braking</b> current is small was given on the motor from the brake-start point. In response to <b>the</b> ratio <b>of</b> speed down, <b>the</b> pulses were gained by phototransister which respond to light through <b>the</b> hole <b>of</b> disk installed on motor. <b>The</b> distance <b>of</b> pulse was converted into position stepping in <b>the</b> second dynamic <b>braking</b> <b>of</b> which <b>braking</b> current is large. This way was termed the second-step dynamic braking. By such a way, as <b>the</b> value <b>of</b> <b>load</b> increased, <b>the</b> <b>braking</b> quantity increased.
