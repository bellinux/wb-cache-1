50|$|The main {{characteristic}} of the proposed model, which also differentiates it from socialist planning models like Parecon, is that it explicitly presupposes a stateless, money-less and market-less economy that precludes private accumulation of wealth and the institutionalisation of privileges for some sections of society, without relying on a mythical post-scarcity state of abundance, or sacrificing freedom of choice. The proposed system aims at satisfying the double aim of:(a) meeting the basic needs of all citizens - which requires that <b>basic</b> <b>macro-economic</b> decisions {{have to be made}} democratically, and(b) securing freedom of choice - which requires the individual to make important decisions affecting his/her own life (what work to do, what to consume etc.).|$|R

40|$|We use regime {{switching}} and regression tree {{methods to}} evaluate {{performance in the}} risk premia strategies provided by Deutsche Bank and constructed from U. S. research data from the Fama French library. The regime switching method uses the Baum-Welch algorithm at its core and splits return data into a normal and a turbulent regime. Each regime is independently evaluated for risk and the estimates are then weighted together according to the expected value of the proceeding regime. The regression tree methods identify macro-economic states in which the risk premia perform well or poorly and use these results to allocate between risk premia strategies. The regime switching method proves to be mostly unimpressive but has its results boosted by investing less into risky assets as the probability of an upcoming turbulent regime becomes larger. This proves to be highly effective for all time periods and for both data sources. The regression tree method proves the most effective when making the assumption that we know all <b>macro-economic</b> <b>data</b> the same month as it is valid for.

Experiments were conducted with EANNs that updated connection weights through genetic operators (crossover and mutation) and/or with the aid of back-propagation. The results showed that the optimal performance was achieved under natural complexification of the EANN and that backpropagation tended to over fit the data. The results also suggested that EANNs trained with multi-objectives were more robust than that of a single optimization approach. The MOO approach produced superior investment returns during training and testing over a single objective optimization (SOO) ...|$|R

This paper uses data from the Satellite Atmospheric Emissions Accounts as well as the 2002 input-output tables both published by the Spanish National Statistics Institute. The identification and analysis of the input paths of air pollution in the Spanish production system is performed using Structural Path Analysis (SPA) in a generalised input-output framework. This methodology allows for the detection of "hidden" sectors in the generation of pollution. Our results rank the energetic sectors, food processing industries, other manufacturing industries and transportation as the sectors with the highest emission intensities. Our results also show the production layers contribution in each pollutant, identifying fluorocarbons and ammonia as the substances with higher up-stream sources. 15 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In {{the article}} {{the reality of}} the planned incomes in the budget for the year 2001 was analyzed. Among the two <b>basic</b> <b>macro-economic</b> indices {{accepted}} for the construction of the budget forecast of the growth of the gross national product (GNP) is too optimistic (4. 5 %). Most probably the growth of GNP in 2001 will not exceed 4. 0 %. At a coefficient of flexibility of the incomes of the state budget with respect to GNP amounting to 0. 2, a lower growth of GNP by 0. 5 % would mean smaller budget incomes from those assumed by about 800 million zloties. The forecast of the second macro-economic index accepted for construction of the budget inflation at a level of 7 % seems to be more accurate. If no essential unpredictable inflation-genic factors occur, the real growth of the prices of consumer goods and services will be shaped probably in accordance with that forecast. Then the influence of inflation on the budget incomes would not diverge from the level accepted in the budget law. The article points out also to the too optimistic forecasting of the incomes from the excise tax and income tax from physical persons. ...|$|R

Various indicators have been developed to measure the effective taxation of income from capital. This paper briefly reviews their properties, before turning to an evaluation {{of the effects of the}} corporate income tax reform in Belgium in the nineties. Our analysis concludes that the tax reform had some success in raising more revenue in a more neutral way by repealing tax expenditures provisions so that the gap between the nominal and effective corporate tax rate narrowed. On the methodological side, our analysis concludes that there is no ideal effective tax rate: implicit tax rates based on <b>macro-economic</b> <b>data</b> and marginal and average effective tax rates are complementary indicators and should be used jointly to assess the effects of tax reforms.

With this significant amount of trade being conducted between members of ASEAN countries, businesses were faced with exchange rate exposure due to the volatility of the exchange rate within the regions as was experienced during the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 - 98. Members of the European Union overcome this exchange rate exposure by agreeing to form a monetary union and adopting Euro as their common currency in 1999. This paper examines the feasibility of a Optimum Currency Area (OCA) for ASEAN 9 to adopt a common currency, especially after the 1997 - 98 Asian Financial Crisis.
