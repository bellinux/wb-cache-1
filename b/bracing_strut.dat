25|$|The G.11E's {{fuselage}} has a tapered, oval section. The forward part is a {{light alloy}} monocoque containing the well glazed cockpit, accessed by two sliding doors. The rear fuselage is a steel tube structure, covered in fabric, bearing a tall T-tail with a moving, one-piece tailplane which corrected the cyclic pitch via the control column to prevent once per revolution pitch oscillations. A wide track undercarriage has main wheels mounted on horizontal V-struts from the fuselage bottom and with a single <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> to the mid-fuselage on each side.|$|E
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Dove were {{strongly}} tapered to a narrow tip, though the straight leading edge was only slightly swept. [...] Wide span ailerons covered much of the straight, forward swept, trailing edge. The wing was built around a main wooden box spar transversely braced to a subsidiary rear spar and plywood covered from the latter forward. Behind this rear spar the wing was fabric covered. [...] The outer panels were readily detachable for transport. The wide track undercarriage had a single vertical long travel leg on each side to the main spar, with a small <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> forward. The first {{two of the three}} Doves built had their wheels enclosed in spats, with unfaired legs, but the third used trouser fairings.|$|E
2500|$|The Prefect, {{like the}} Grunau Baby, was a single-seat fabric-covered wooden glider. It had {{high-mounted}} semi-cantilever straight-tapered wings, {{with a single}} wing <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> on each side, {{from the base of}} the fuselage to the wing spar. The span was 150mm (6in) greater than that of the Grunau Baby, and the tips enclosed the outer ends of the ailerons. Mid-chord airbrakes were fitted just outboard of the wing strut ends, extending above and below the wing. The fuselage was flat sided, and tapered from the trailing edge of the wing to a very small fin bearing a large, aerodynamically-balanced and slightly reshaped rudder that extended down to the keel. The straight-tipped tailplane, mounted on the top of the fuselage and braced from below, had a strongly swept leading edge and was placed with its trailing edge at the fin's leading edge, so that the elevators lacked the large cut out for rudder movement seen on the earlier glider. The open cockpit was better enclosed at the sides and had a small windscreen; for access, the cockpit sides and windscreen were removed as a single piece. [...] Slingsby also added a [...] single-wheel undercarriage in addition to the earlier nose skid, placed below mid-chord.|$|E

50|$|The T.31 was a tandem two-seat {{development}} of the T.8 Tutor (RAF Cadet TX.2). The fuselage was based on that of the T.29 Motor Tutor, increased in length and widened slightly; the wings and tail were unchanged. A single T.31A prototype was flown in 1949, followed by the production T.31B, with spoilers and a small additional wing <b>bracing</b> <b>strut.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sprint SKh: Agricultural {{spraying}} version. Carries 130 L (28.6 Imp gal; 34.3 US gal) of sprayant in two streamlined tanks {{attached to}} the lower fuselage {{just ahead of the}} wing <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> and main undercarriage leg. Liquid chemical is applied via underwing spraybars from the lower fuselage and supported below the wing on each side by a V-strut.|$|E
5000|$|LK-4-IV - The final {{variation}} was a low-wing monoplane {{with the}} lower wing replaced by the upper wing and twin <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> {{to the top of}} the fuselage.|$|R
50|$|The two outer Salmson engines were mounted, uncowled, on {{the forward}} wing <b>bracing</b> <b>struts,</b> with {{extended}} streamlined bodies behind them which {{connected to the}} rear bracing strut; the forward struts were reinforced by jury struts to the wing roots and the rear <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> by vertical jury struts to the rear spar. The Potez 40 had a tailwheel undercarriage with its main legs with rubber shock absorbers mounted vertically below the outer engine extensions; the mainwheels were hinged on widely spaced V-Struts from the lower fuselage and were sometimes enclosed under spats.|$|R
50|$|Typically, {{the ends}} of <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> are joined to the main {{internal}} structural components such as a wing spar or a fuselage bulkhead, and bracing wires are attached close by.|$|R
50|$|Utilising the wings, struts {{and tail}} {{unit of the}} T.8 Kirby Tutor, the T.29 Motor Tutor had a new {{fuselage}} incorporating a wheeled undercarriage and the cockpit under the wing centre section. Early trials revealed resonance of the front wing struts, which was rectified by adding a vertical <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> vertically up to the mainspar. This modification was introduced for all Kirby Tutors to allow aero-tow launching.|$|E
50|$|The G.11E's {{fuselage}} has a tapered, oval section. The forward part is a {{light alloy}} monocoque containing the well glazed cockpit, accessed by two sliding doors. The rear fuselage is a steel tube structure, covered in fabric, bearing a tall T-tail with a moving, one-piece tailplane which corrected the cyclic pitch via the control column to prevent once per revolution pitch oscillations. A wide track undercarriage has main wheels mounted on horizontal V-struts from the fuselage bottom and with a single <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> to the mid-fuselage on each side.|$|E
50|$|The {{pneumatically}} actuated inwards retracting undercarriage {{was housed}} inside the inner lower-wing which folded at approx ½ span {{to lie in}} recesses in {{the sides of the}} fuselage. The outer halves of the lower wings remained horizontal as the wings retracted and were housed in recesses in the under-surfaces of the upper wings. Retraction of the wings was carried out by a single vertically mounted pneumatic actuator in the fuselage which unlocked the bracing struts either side and pulled the wing upwards as the <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> was pulled upwards.|$|E
50|$|The Junkers J 1 was a mid-wing {{monoplane}} with a cantilever wing, without exterior <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> or wires. External bracing {{was used}} only for support of the horizontal stabilisers and the undercarriage.|$|R
50|$|<b>Bracing</b> <b>struts</b> {{and wires}} of many kinds were {{extensively}} used in early aircraft to stiffen and strengthen, {{and sometimes even}} to form, the main functional airframe. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s they fell out of use in favour of the low-drag cantilever construction. Most aircraft <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> are principally loaded in compression, with wires taking the tension loads. Lift struts came into increasing use during the changeover period and remain in use on smaller aircraft today where ultimate performance is not an issue. Typically they are applied to a high-wing monoplane and act in tension during flight.|$|R
50|$|The Magni PM.2 Vittoria was an Italian experimental, single seat, {{parasol wing}} {{aircraft}} {{built in the}} mid-1920s. It had a large area aerofoil on each of its single wing <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> which could be rotated together or independently to give lift or drag.|$|R
50|$|The 65-1 had {{straight}} tapered, square tipped {{wings of}} equal span. Each was {{built around a}} single spar and skinned with aluminium. It was a single bay biplane with, on each side, a single, faired vertical interplane strut and a long <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> from the lower fuselage to the upper wing {{near the top of}} the interplane strut. The ailerons, fitted on piano hinges on both upper and lower wings, were made of aluminium and unbalanced. Flaps were carried on the upper wing only, filling 60% of its span. They had four positions, with a maximum deflection of 35°.|$|E
50|$|The round nosed, {{single seat}} cabin is formed from six bonded pieces and {{mounted on the}} boom with its {{windscreen}} at the wing leading edge, placing the pilot below the wing at about one quarter chord. The sides are normally open though complete enclosure is an option. On each side a forward leaning <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> runs from the lower rear cabin to the front wing spar. The Sländan has a short, fixed, tricycle undercarriage with a steerable nosewheel; the mainwheels, fitted with brakes, are mounted on straight steel cantilever legs from the lower fuselage. There is a protective tailskid {{on the tip of}} the underfin.|$|E
5000|$|The A-60 was an all-wood, {{low wing}} {{cantilever}} monoplane. Its wing was in three parts, with a rectangular centre section and two outer, gently straight tapered panels with semi-elliptical tips. These outer panels were mounted with 4° of dihedral and carried ailerons each of 3.48 m span, occupying {{most of their}} trailing edges. The wing was built around two spars and was plywood covered. [...] The A-60's landing gear was of the tailskid type and each independently mounted mainweel was on a robust, rubber sprung, vertical duralumin leg attached to the forward spar of the outer extremities, with a lighter, angled <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> to the rear longeron. The gear had a track of 1.90 m and was often entirely contained within vertical trouser fairings.|$|E
50|$|This was {{essentially}} a Raleigh Twenty reduced in size by 10%. It differed from the larger model in that it dispensed with the <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> at the bottom bracket. The Eighteen was introduced in 1972 and aimed at children and shorter adults.|$|R
50|$|Peak wind {{speeds of}} over 90 mph were {{recorded}} at Jodrell Bank Observatory, which severely tested {{the structure of}} the Lovell Telescope. Following the storm two diagonal <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> were added to give the telescope greater rigidity when parked in the zenith to ride out storms.|$|R

5000|$|The {{first flight}} under Curtiss power {{was made on}} 21 August 1924. Flight testing followed, {{resulting}} in major modifications. The upper wing was given an unswept leading edge and hence had constant chord and the small lower wing was replaced by one with the same chord as the upper plane and a span almost its equal, mounted with marked stagger. No longer a sesquiplane, the splayed V interplane struts were replaced with more rigid N-form ones. Another <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> ran from the forward foot of the interplane strut {{to the top of}} the root to upper wing inner strut, to further improve torsional strength. At the rear, the little fin was remove and the rudder, still balanced, reshaped. [...] Two more aircraft with these modifications were built.|$|E
5000|$|The {{wings of}} the Dove were {{strongly}} tapered to a narrow tip, though the straight leading edge was only slightly swept. Wide span ailerons covered much of the straight, forward swept, trailing edge. The wing was built around a main wooden box spar transversely braced to a subsidiary rear spar and plywood covered from the latter forward. Behind this rear spar the wing was fabric covered. [...] The outer panels were readily detachable for transport. The wide track undercarriage had a single vertical long travel leg on each side to the main spar, with a small <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> forward.

5000|$|The Sprint is a high-wing {{monoplane}} with a constant-chord, straight-edged single-spar wing built, {{like most}} of the aircraft, from duralumin and braced with a single forward-leaning, streamlined strut on each side to the lower fuselage. Flaps are fitted. The fuselage is of the pod-and-boom type. The pod is narrow, seating two in tandem under a three-piece transparency that extends, smoothly contoured, from just aft of the wing leading edge almost to the extreme nose. The Sprint's fixed tricycle undercarriage is mounted on the fuselage, with spring cantilever main legs attached to the lower fuselage just below the wing <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> attachment points and a castoring nosewheel on a short extension placing it {{just in front of the}} nose. Its pusher configuration [...] Rotax 912 ULS water-cooled flat four engine is mounted on the upper rear of the pod at wing height, driving a three blade propeller just behind the trailing edge. The T tail unit is carried on the narrow rectangular section boom, an extension of the lower pod structure. Its fin is broad, swept and straight-edged, with a rear sloping hinge for the nearly rectangular rudder; the tailplane is braced from below to the boom.|$|E
50|$|A <b>strut</b> bar, <b>strut</b> <b>brace,</b> or <b>strut</b> tower <b>brace</b> (STB) is an {{automotive}} suspension accessory usually used {{in conjunction}} with MacPherson struts on monocoque or unibody chassis to provide extra stiffness between the strut towers.|$|R
5000|$|Magni {{continued}} {{to experiment with}} rotating <b>bracing</b> <b>struts</b> {{to the start of}} World War II. The Magni Vale of 1935 had a faired V-strut bracing the wing on each side. The leading members of these were fixed but the rear ones could be rotated as airbrakes as they could on the Vittoria.|$|R
50|$|The AL 3's elderly 1.3 m track {{undercarriage}} {{seen from}} ahead formed a splayed M-form set of rigid, longitudinally wire <b>braced</b> <b>struts.</b> The large diameter wheels were mounted on half axles, hinged at {{the centre of}} the M and joined to its outer members by rubber shock absorbers. A tall tailskid protected the rudder.|$|R
5000|$|The wing has {{a single}} box spar with spruce webs and ply caps. [...] Plywood skin forward around {{the nose of the}} wing forms a D-shaped torsion box ahead of the spar and there is fabric {{covering}} aft, including the ailerons. In plan the wing centre section has constant chord; there are airbrakes which open above the wing only, placed immediately aft of the spar and about two-thirds the way out along this section. The outer wing panels are tapered on both edges and have semi-elliptical tips; ailerons, hinged parallel to the trailing edge fill these panels spanwise. On each side a single, faired, metal wing <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> runs from the lower fuselage longeron to the wing spar at about half centre section span. The horizontal tail is of similar construction to the wing and largely fabric covered, mounted on top of the fuselage far enough forward to place the trailing edge of the split elevator ahead of the rudder hinge. The fin is small and straight edged but the rudder, again fabric covered, is full and slightly curved; it is horn balanced and extends down to the keel.|$|E
5000|$|The Prefect, {{like the}} Grunau Baby, was a single-seat fabric-covered wooden glider. It had {{high-mounted}} semi-cantilever straight-tapered wings, {{with a single}} wing <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> on each side, {{from the base of}} the fuselage to the wing spar. The span was 150 mm (6 in) greater than that of the Grunau Baby, and the tips enclosed the outer ends of the ailerons. Mid-chord airbrakes were fitted just outboard of the wing strut ends, extending above and below the wing. The fuselage was flat sided, and tapered from the trailing edge of the wing to a very small fin bearing a large, aerodynamically-balanced and slightly reshaped rudder that extended down to the keel. The straight-tipped tailplane, mounted on the top of the fuselage and braced from below, had a strongly swept leading edge and was placed with its trailing edge at the fin's leading edge, so that the elevators lacked the large cut out for rudder movement seen on the earlier glider. The open cockpit was better enclosed at the sides and had a small windscreen; for access, the cockpit sides and windscreen were removed as a single piece. [...] Slingsby also added a single-wheel undercarriage in addition to the earlier nose skid, placed below mid-chord.|$|E
5000|$|This pillar also {{mounted the}} Avia's [...] pusher {{configuration}} Poinsard flat twin engine with its cylinder heads exposed for air-cooling. A 1.60 m diameter propeller rotated over the wing behind the rear <b>bracing</b> <b>strut</b> within the inner {{section of the}} wing. The fuselage was built around four spruce longerons, with formers to round the cross section, and was ply covered. The Avia's single, open cockpit was immediately ahead of the central pillar in a forward fuselage with a roughly prolate elliptical section. Aft of the pillar the fuselage was more slender and flatter sided. The horizontal tail was mounted on a small step with a curved leading edge; the straight swept tailplane {{was little more than}} a faired hinge for full, tapered, balanced and elliptically tipped elevators. Its fin was also small, with a tall, deep curved rudder that extended to the keel; [...] the elevator hinge was well forward of that of the rudder, so only a small cut-away in the elevator trailing edges was needed for rudder movement. The fixed parts of the empennage were covered with ply and the control surfaces with fabric. It landed on a conventional skid, with a pair of retractable wheels to aid ground handling.|$|E
25|$|In 1920, Marchetti {{redesigned}} the MVT, {{giving it}} wings of longer span and splayed interplane <b>bracing</b> <b>struts,</b> a new cabane structure, {{and a more}} powerful engine, the SPA 62a rated at 234 kilowatts (285 horsepower). In this redesigned form, the MVT underwent testing at Guidonia Montecelio, where it achieved a speed of 275 kilometers per hour (171 miles per hour).|$|R
