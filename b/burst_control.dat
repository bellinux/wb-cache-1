40|$|Based on {{the novel}} {{concepts}} of the <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> plate, the current article aims to demonstrate {{the effectiveness of the}} <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> plate attached at different locations (5 %, 7. 5 % and 10 % of the chord of the airfoil) on a NACA 631 - 012 airfoil section for laminar separation bubble burst delay, stall suppression, lift augmentation and drag reduction at a chord Reynolds number of 1. 3 x 105. The effectiveness of the <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> plate is governed by its height, width, geometry and the distance between the leading-edge of the airfoil and the trailing-edge of the plate. Flow patterns around the airfoil with and without the plate attachment were studied with an aid of smoke flow visualization. The results suggest that the stall angle of the original airfoil (without the <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> plate) occurs at 10 o and it is successfully postponed to approximately 13 o when the <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> plate is attached onto the airfoil. Lift and drag forces were measured for a range of angle-of-attack from 0 o to + 20 o. The experimental results have shown that the lift generated on the NACA 631 - 012 airfoil with the plate attachment and above 9 o angle-of-attack is significantly higher than the original airfoil, while the drag is sufficiently reduced. The overall results demonstrated the application of the <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> plate on the NACA 631 - 012 airfoil can be effective means of bubble <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> and airfoil stall suppression in low speed flows.

This paper studies transport layer protocols with end-to-end fault tolerance through multihoming technologies and their performance improvements. Currently, the research on multihomed transport layer protocols is in the early stages. Most of the algorithms in the protocols are inherited from traditional single-path oriented transmission protocols. This paper analyzes in-depth the effects of retransmission polices and path failure detection mechanisms on the protocol performance and stability in multi-path environments through SCTP (Stream Control Transmission Protocol) simulations. The contributions and innovations are as follows. (1) An algorithm for removing spurious failover is proposed to avoid two SCTP stall scenarios found by this paper. In some special path conditions or protocol setting situations, the sender can not obtain precise path delay measurements, which results in spurious transmission timeout, path failover and finally causes the protocol to enter an unstable state. The first stall scenario is triggered when the receiver is using the delayed acknowledgement algorithm. The second scenario occurs when the sender is transmitting packets with different lengths. (2) A mathematic model for estimating receiver buffer blocking is put forward to determine path selection during the fast retransmission phase. This paper illustrates that retransmission on an alternate path will degrade performance significantly when the secondary path bandwidth {{is lower than the}} primary path bandwidth at a certain level because of receiver buffer blocking due to disordered data chunks. (3) The fast recovery algorithm in SCTP is improved for multi-path environments through decoupling the Congestion Control Windows of alternate paths from the primary path Congestion Control Window in the fast recovery phase to prevent the performance degradation caused by disordered SACKs (Selective Acknowledgement). Two data <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> algorithms are evaluated. The test results indicate that <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> by adjusting the Congestion Control Window is better than <b>burst</b> <b>control</b> by limiting the maximum number of transmitted packets. (4) Fast retransmission on an alternate path is studied in the case of multiple paths sharing a congestion point. The results show that fast retransmission on an alternate path will increase congestion of the bottleneck link in this situation. (5) A decision tree for SCTP parameter configuration is proposed. This paper evaluates the performance of fast retransmission policies, timeout retransmission policies and path failure detection thresholds in multi-path contexts. It integrates the above findings and presents the policies for retransmission path selection and path failure detection threshold setting in different path conditions. Finally, this paper emphasizes that the main problem in the current SCTP design is that it employs TCP single-path algorithms in multi-path environments without significant modifications. Therefore, single-path algorithms should be re-evaluated before being applied to multi-path environments...|$|E

In OBS control packet called <b>control</b> <b>burst</b> is separated from data packet called data <b>burst.</b> A <b>control</b> <b>burst</b> is sent in advance, which configures the switches in the path for the data burst. Due to lack of adequate contention resolution technique data burst loss is high in OBS. Schemes such as fiber delay line (FDL), wavelength conversion, deflection routing are the solution to prevent network congestion. But {{they have their own}} limitations. So a contention resolution technique is needed in OBS. In this paper we propose a scheme to minimize contention and to control traffic flow in the network. The proposed scheme logically divides a given network to clusters and selects a node as cluster head from each cluster. Cluster head keeps track of the resources available in the network and exchange the status of the resources among themselves to maintain up-to-date information. A node within a cluster that wishes to send a burst make request to its cluster head for a available wavelength on the path to destination. If a unused wavelength is available on the path to its destination, then it send a reply message with the available wavelength else send a reply no wavelength is available. Node after receiving a reply from the cluster head send a <b>control</b> <b>burst</b> followed by data burst on the wavelength that it has received from cluster head. If the reply says no wavelength is available then it waits for some specified time and sends another request. Since the cluster heads maintain the status of the resources at any time, t, it will minimize the contention of bursts. We made a comparison between the different techniques using simulation.
