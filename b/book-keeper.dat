500|$|Bellingham {{was born}} in about 1770, in the county of Huntingdonshire. His father, also named John, was a land agent and miniaturist painter; his mother Elizabeth was from a well-to-do Huntingdonshire family. In 1779 John senior became mentally ill, and, after {{confinement}} in an asylum, died in 1780 or 1781. The family [...] were then provided for by William Daw, Elizabeth's brother-in-law, a prosperous lawyer who arranged Bellingham's appointment as an officer cadet on board the East India Company's ship Hartwell. En route to India the [...] ship mutinied and was wrecked of {{the coast of the}} Cape Verde islands; Bellingham survived and returned home. [...] Daw then helped him to set up in business as a tin plate manufacturer in London, but after a few years the business failed, and Bellingham was made bankrupt in 1794. He appears to have escaped debtors' prison, perhaps through the further intervention of Daw. Chastened by this experience, he decided to settle down, and obtained a post as a <b>book-keeper</b> with a firm engaged in trade with Russia. He worked hard, and was sufficiently regarded by his employers to be appointed in 1800 as the firm's resident representative in Archangel, Russia. On his return home, Bellingham set up his own trading business, and moved to Liverpool. In 1803 he married Mary Neville from Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|During the {{six years}} he spent working as a <b>book-keeper</b> {{in the town of}} Kustanai he wrote several {{important}} essays, including [...] "Discourse in the Novel". In 1936, living in Saransk, he became an obscure figure in a provincial college, dropping out of view and teaching only occasionally. In 1937, Bakhtin moved to Kimry, a town located hundred kilometers from Moscow. Here, Bakhtin completed work on a book concerning the 18th-century German novel which was subsequently accepted by the Sovetskii Pisatel' Publishing House. However, the only copy of the manuscript disappeared during the upheaval caused by the German invasion.|$|E

2500|$|Baily {{joined the}} 3rd Volunteer Battalion of the Somerset Light Infantry as a second-lieutenant in 1900, and the {{following}} year was promoted to lieutenant. He was promoted again in 1904, to captain, and by 1905 he commanded [...] "C" [...] (Glastonbury) company of the battalion. He married Dora Glass in Clifton in March 1905, at which time he helped run the family business, working as a <b>book-keeper</b> for Messrs A Baily and Co, at the Beckery Leather Factory in Glastonbury. Later in 1905, he resigned his command of [...] "C" [...] company in the Somerset Light Infantry, and two month later he resigned his commission. Baily died on 21 September 1924, aged 44, in Burnham-on-Sea, Somerset. He was survived by his mother, a brother (Horace Baily) and a sister (Mrs G. Ford Tilley).|$|E
2500|$|Clarissa Oakes is the eponymous {{character}} in the novel Clarissa Oakes (published as The Truelove in the US). Her early life was very difficult; she was sexually abused as a child, then left penniless {{after the death of}} her guardian. She {{took a job as a}} <b>book-keeper</b> in a brothel, where she was occasionally forced to work as a prostitute. [...] These experiences left her with no emotional attachment to the act of love-making. She was sentenced to death for killing a man (she blew off his head with a fowling piece), but the sentence was commuted to transport to Sydney, New South Wales. When the Surprise leaves Sydney, Jack discovers that midshipman Oakes has smuggled the convict on board. Jack quickly marries the two off in order to prevent problems with the authorities. Clarissa's presence causes friction among the crew, as she is somewhat free with her [...] "favors" [...] until Maturin convinces her to be faithful to her husband. Clarissa is able to provide Maturin with information that uncovers the source of intelligence leaks inside the British government. Stephen is able to set up Clarissa on his estate in England, where she resides after her husband's death at sea. Clarissa later acts as Stephen's daughter's guardian after Diana leaves home, unable to deal with Brigid's autism (in The Commodore). In Blue at the Mizzen she marries a scholarly clergyman.|$|E
2500|$|When {{a second}} {{criminal}} trial for bribery began to loom for Doheny and Fall in 1929, {{the pressure on}} all parties reached a breaking point. The Doheny's tried to persuade Hugh Plunkett {{to be committed to}} a mental institute so that he could not then be made to testify against them. [...] On February 16th an argument broke out at about 10pm between Ned and Plunkett, Ned shot Plunkett and then himself. [...] There were rumours that the two were having an affair. [...] The full story was never clear. [...] The police were not called until three hours after the shots had been fired, despite several members of the family being at home and having heard the yelling. [...] The Los Angeles authorities immediately blamed Plunkett in the murder-suicide. In addition to the indictment of Edward Doheny in the Teapot Dome scandal, both Doheny and Plunkett had been indicted in the alleged bribe of Albert Fall—as Ned (accompanied by Plunkett) had delivered the money. They had already gone through some trials. Raymond Chandler, a former oil man, included a thinly veiled account of this event in one chapter of his novel The High Window, presenting it as a bygone, hushed-up case. He had started work for the Dabney Oil Syndicate in 1922 as a <b>book-keeper</b> and auditor, but was fired a decade later.|$|E

After an argument between both women and Daniel ensues, Ellen forfeits the couch and throws Daniel and his friend out, immediately afterwards retrieving a bag from a cupboard which contains £25,000 which Daniel had won from gambling and stashed in the flat. Ellen splits the money, giving £13,000 of it to Cora to pay the maintenance Daniel had never paid for Col, and she takes the remaining money to the <b>book-keepers</b> where she bets the lot on a no-chance horse. Seconds after leaving the <b>book-keepers</b> she is approached by Daniel who has realised his mistake and is demanding his money back; Ellen hands him the betting slip and walks away with Cora, having finally got her revenge on him.|$|R

60|$|With {{his father}} {{there would be}} no difficulty. His father had seen Alice and admired her; he would be all right.
