25|$|After {{wrapping}} up the 1988 Republican nomination, Bush selected Senator Dan Quayle of Indiana {{as his running}} mate, surprising many who expected Bush to select a more experienced running mate. Quayle was often mocked for his verbal gaffes, and many Republicans urged Bush to dump Quayle from the ticket. Bush selected a mostly new Cabinet, but kept around many former Reagan officials, including Attorney General Dick Thornburgh. Bush's long-time friend James Baker, who had served as Reagan's Chief of Staff, became Secretary of State. Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had previously served as Gerald Ford's Chief of Staff and would later serve as vice president under George W. Bush. Bush's first pick for Defense Secretary, John Tower, {{was rejected by the}} Senate, becoming the first cabinet nominee of an incoming president to be rejected. <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft</b> was appointed as the National Security Advisor, a role he had also held under Ford.|$|E
500|$|On November 25, 1986, President Reagan {{announced}} {{the creation of}} a Special Review Board to look into the matter; the following day, he appointed former Senator John Tower, former Secretary of State Edmund Muskie, and former National Security Adviser <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft</b> to serve as members. This Presidential Commission took effect on December 1 and became known as the Tower Commission. The main objectives of the commission were to inquire into [...] "the circumstances surrounding the Iran-Contra matter, other case studies that might reveal strengths and weaknesses in the operation of the National Security Council system under stress, {{and the manner in which}} that system has served eight different presidents since its inception in 1947". The Tower Commission was the first presidential commission to review and evaluate the National Security Council.|$|E
500|$|President Reagan professed that he {{was unaware}} of the plot's existence. He opened his own {{investigation}} and appointed two Republicans and one Democrat (John Tower, <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft</b> and Edmund Muskie, known as the [...] "Tower Commission") to investigate the scandal. The commission could not find direct evidence that Reagan had prior knowledge of the program, but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff, making the diversion of funds possible. A separate report by Congress concluded that [...] "If the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing, he should have." [...] Reagan's popularity declined from 67% to 46% in less than a week, the greatest and quickest decline ever for a president. The scandal resulted in fourteen indictments within Reagan's staff, and eleven convictions.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{operation}} was successful, National Security Advisor <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft</b> would later point to the psychological harassment of the Papal Nuncio as [...] "a low moment in US Army history," [...] noting that their approach had been silly, reproachable and undignified.|$|E
2500|$|On November 21, 2008, <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft</b> and Zbigniew Brzezinski {{wrote in}} an article in the Washington Post that they also {{supported}} key parts of the Initiative, while adding conditions that until now have been rejected by the Arab states that sponsored it when they said: ...|$|E
2500|$|After retirement, Gulley {{went into}} {{business}} with <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft,</b> Marvin Watson, Jack Brennan, Omar Zawawi (the {{brother of the}} Omani foreign minister), and former Lyndon Johnson aide Haywood Smith. The six men were partners in a company they named the International Six, Inc. (ISI). According to a Washington Post article from the time period, [...] "the nature of their business, investing or consulting is not something they choose to discuss".|$|E
2500|$|Gulley {{had been}} {{recommended}} {{to his new}} post by <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft.</b> He was the first civilian to hold the position of chief of the military office; {{to make it appear}} the president's staff was smaller than it was, Gulley was placed on the United States Postal Service payroll. He spent the next 11 years in charge of the White House Military Office, which was then responsible for the nuclear football, Air Force One, Marine One, the White House Communications Agency, and the White House Mess.|$|E
2500|$|In 1989, in the George H. W. Bush administration, Zelikow was {{detailed}} to {{join the}} National Security Council, where he was involved as a senior White House staffer in the diplomacy surrounding the German reunification and the diplomatic settlements accompanying {{the end of the}} Cold War in Europe. During the first Gulf War, he aided President Bush, National Security Advisor <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft,</b> and Secretary of State James Baker in diplomatic affairs related to the coalition. He co-authored, with Condoleezza Rice, the book Germany Unified and Europe Transformed: A Study in Statecraft (1995), an academic study [...] of the politics of reunification.|$|E
2500|$|Besides {{arguing that}} Iraq {{was not the}} top {{strategic}} priority {{in the war on}} terrorism or in the Middle East, critics of the war also suggested that it could potentially destabilize the surrounding region. Prominent among such critics was <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft,</b> who served as National Security Advisor to George H. W. Bush. In a 15August 2002 Wall Street Journal editorial entitled [...] "Don't attack Saddam", Scowcroft wrote that, [...] "Possibly the most dire consequences would be the effect in the region ... there would be an explosion of outrage against us ... the results could well destabilize Arab regimes", and, [...] "could even swell the ranks of the terrorists." [...] In an October 2015 CNN interview with Fareed Zakaria, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair apologized for his 'mistakes' over Iraq War and admitted there were 'elements of truth' to the view that the invasion helped promote the rise of ISIS.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{remaining}} members of Nixon's Cabinet stayed in place until Ford's dramatic reorganization {{in the fall of}} 1975, an action referred to by political commentators as the [...] "Halloween Massacre". All but three Cabinet members were replaced in 1975, the exceptions being Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, Secretary of the Treasury William E. Simon, and Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. Ford appointed George H.W. Bush as Director of the Central Intelligence Agency, while Rumsfeld became Secretary of Defense and Cheney replaced Rumsfeld as Chief of Staff, becoming the youngest ever White House Chief of Staff. The moves were intended to fortify Ford's right flank against a primary challenge from Ronald Reagan. Ford also sought to end the in-fighting between Kissinger and Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger. Though Kissinger remained as Secretary of State, <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft</b> replaced Kissinger as National Security Adviser.|$|E
2500|$|In 2007, Didier {{increased}} the number of public events at the library, including visits by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Charlie Savage, the Washington Post's Bob Woodward, former U.S. ambassador to Britain Henry Catto, former National Security Advisor <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft,</b> and others in a series of lectures that resulted in increased reference requests at the library. In August 2007, Didier was appointed to a selection panel of judges to choose the official symbol of the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts of America. Two months later in October 2007, Didier was filmed in two-hour live broadcast on C-SPAN that featured the 21 million pages of documents and 500,000 audio-visual materials in Gerald Ford's library. In the C-SPAN series, entitled [...] "Presidential Libraries: History Uncovered," [...] Didier and supervisory archivist David Horrocks showed off special documents that have been used by researchers like Bob Woodward and artifacts such as Ford's Eagle Scout medal and the Profile in Courage Award he received at the Kennedy Library in 2001.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2012, nine former United States Ambassadors, {{including}} five former ambassadors to Israel, {{wrote a letter}} in support of nominating Hagel. <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft,</b> Anthony Zinni and nine other retired senior military officers signed a separate letter of support. Robert Gates and Colin Powell also endorsed Hagel for the nomination, with Powell calling him [...] "that kind of independent and bold leader who thinks {{in and out of}} the box" [...] who can [...] "deal with the strategic and resource challenges [...] will be facing over the next several years." [...] Rabbi Aryeh Azriel, the senior rabbi at Temple Israel in Omaha, Nebraska since 1988, wrote in a CNN article that [...] " [...] record shows strong support for Israel" [...] and that Hagel understands [...] "the Israeli people and their desire to live in peace and security." [...] He added that [...] "Recent efforts to smear Chuck ... ultimately that hurts the long-term security of the state of Israel." ...|$|E
2500|$|More recently, Hanson has {{appeared}} {{to reject the}} term neoconservative, writing in a 2016 column [...] "Hillary's Neoliberals" [...] that the term neoconservative was coined in the 1970s to describe liberals who moved right on social issues and on maintaining deterrence during the Cold War. Hanson has critiqued the decision of several neoconservatives to declare their support for Hillary Clinton as preferable to Donald Trump on grounds that Clinton {{has a long history}} of abuse of office, and is mired in scandal over violations of national security statutes as well as influence peddling between the Clinton Foundation and the State Department. Hanson has attacked these neoconservatives as [...] "neoliberals" [...] who were never entirely proper conservative, arguing that these people had joined the Republican Party out of distaste for the Democratic Party, which had nominated as the presidential candidates George McGovern in 1972 and Jimmy Carter in 1976 as opposed to converting to conservatism. [...] Hanson ended his column that there were now two emerging factions in America — the proverbial ordinary Americans supporting Trump vs. the elites of both the Democratic and Republican parties supporting Clinton. Hanson wrote: [...] "A mostly urban, highly educated, and high-income globalized elite often shares more cultural and political affinities with their counterparts on the other side of the aisle than they do with the lower-middle and working classes of their own parties. Just as Hillary Clinton may feel more comfortable with the old neoconservatives, Trump supporters have little in common with either Clintonites or neocons. Clinton versus Trump is a war of NPR, CBS, and the New York Times against the National Enquirer, conservative talk radio, and the Drudge Report. Clinton supporters such as former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, onetime Bush officials Hank Paulson and <b>Brent</b> <b>Scowcroft,</b> and billionaire Meg Whitman certainly have nothing in common with Republican Trump supporters such as Mike Huckabee and Rush Limbaugh. Culture, not just politics, is rapidly destroying—but also rebuilding—traditional political parties." ...|$|E
