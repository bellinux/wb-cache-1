The paper finally explores and partially confirms some predictions of the Cordella & Yeyati (1998) banking competition model which postulates that with better disclosure, financial firms will shift to quality competition, i. e. opt for lower risk strategies whereas non transparent markets foster pure price competition at the expense quality of individual financial firms...|$|R
40|$|We {{critique}} {{transformational leadership}} education in university business schools {{based on a}} literature review, {{a study of the}} websites of 21 leading business schools, and an analysis of two presentations to business school students at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Stanford University by the former CEO of General Electric, Jack Welch. Our critique draws attention to the unresolved tension between two motivating ideas that underpin much teaching in business schools: collective interest ideas that permeate transformational leadership education; and self-interest ideas derived from agency theory. Transformational leadership tends to be depicted as a process by which leaders exert a ‘top-down’ influence over the activities of others, while simultaneously asserting that their organizations have a common purpose and pursue a collective interest. We highlight the risk that business schools are producing graduates who will attempt to appeal to common needs (guided by precepts of transformational leadership) but who will simultaneously enact contradictory performance management systems (guided by agency theory). We encourage business school educators in leadership to adopt approaches which are more critical, relational and reflexive. We suggest some general directions for an alternative leadership <b>prospectus,</b> <b>based</b> on followership, the promotion of critical upward communication within organizations, and the recognition of leadership as a contested, discursive and co-constructed phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{considers}} how auditing practices became muddled in the US and the UK {{to create}} muddled corporate governance principles. The US 1933 law that required corporations to appoint an auditor was <b>based</b> on the <b>prospectus</b> {{provisions in the}} UK 1929 Companies Act to protect investors from fraud. However, {{this is not the}} purpose of UK statutory audits whose legal role is to protect the company and provide shareholders with intelligence for voting on the election and remuneration of directors whether or not the company issues shares or whether it has shares publicly traded. The UK statutory auditor only reports to the shareholders who approve his appointment and remuneration. The US auditor is appointed by the directors and reports to both directors and shareholders to subrogate the reason for having an auditor to identify conflicts between them. The establishment of audit committees with independent directors cannot remove the conflicts. These are exacerbated by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the UK Combined Code that require audit committees to provide oversight of the auditor. Some European countries avoid these conflicts by the auditor being controlled by a shareholder committee or “watchdog board”. Audit practices got muddled by corporations not establishing a shareholder audit committee as provided in the model constitutio...|$|R
40|$|Selling {{stock to}} the general public is one {{important}} method by which firms are able to raise new equity capital. If the firm sells stock for the first time {{to the general}} public, it is called an initial public offering (IPO). Subsequent to the IPO, firms may seek to raise further equity capital by offering to sell new shares through a seasoned equity offering (SEO). In the UK, most young/small firms initially raise equity capital from a small number of investors through private placements. If a firm prospers and needs additional equity capital, it may choose at some point to go public by selling stock through an IPO. By issuing publicly traded equity, the firm establishes both a market value for the firm and a market for its common stock. There have been many IPO studies that record the so-called “Underpricing anomaly” as a primary stylised fact of IPOs. The underpricing refers to the significance increase of the IPO market price over the first few days after the initial listing. This fact suggests that the IPO pricing is not simple very few information about the issuing firm is available to the market prior to IPO. This study is to examine the IPO valuation <b>based</b> on the <b>prospectus</b> information, which is perceived as comprehensive information about the firm prior to the IPOs. Furthermore, this study is also to observe the impact of the prospectus information on the IPO after market performances. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
