5|$|The {{line was}} {{constructed}} by the South Eastern Railway, settling a rivalry with the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway that led to disputes over the route and planning. It opened in 1851 after several false starts, followed by <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> to Rye Harbour in 1854, Dungeness in 1881 and New Romney in 1884. The line struggled to be profitable and it seemed likely that it would close following the Beeching Report. All the <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> were closed by 1967 but the main line was kept open because of poor road connections in the area. Services are currently being provided by Southern.|$|E

5|$|By the 1980s {{a number}} of {{heritage}} railways had been established in Victoria on closed <b>branch</b> <b>lines.</b> These railways serve both as tourist attractions, and to preserve the railway past. The work of railway preservation groups has since expanded to retired railway carriages, electric multiple units, rail motors, and diesel locomotives. In 2006 heritage railways carried 542,000 patrons over 161km of track; with 28 operational steam locomotives, 47 diesels, 14 railmotors, and 192 carriages.|$|E
5|$|In 1944, BOT {{superintendent}} Philip E. Pheifer {{put forth}} a proposal for Second Avenue Subway services, which would branch extensively off to B Division. The subway was originally to be opened by 1951, but by 1945, plans for the Second Avenue Subway were again revised. Another plan was put forth in 1947 by Colonel Sidney H. Bingham, a city planner and former Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) engineer. O'Dwyer and Gross believed that construction of a Second Avenue subway line would be vital to both increasing capacity on existing lines and allowing new <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> to be built. Bingham's proposal involved more <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> and track connections than did Phiefer's, and similar to the 1960s and 1990s phased proposals, was {{to be built in}} sections. However, by the next year, New York City was short $145 million that was needed for a $800 million program for rehabilitation and proposed capital improvements. The City petitioned the New York State Legislature to exceed its $655 million debt ceiling so that the city could spend $500 million on subway construction, but this request was denied.|$|E
5|$|Splash dams, greased chutes, {{railroad}} landings, railroad <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> {{and steam}} donkey operations {{were among the}} strategies utilized to exploit the watershed's resources of timber. Unfortunately, railroad embankments and fills used to build up tributaries had artificially straightened them in the process, and erosion increased dramatically on the barren hillside, causing many streams to become much siltier than they naturally would be. Nearly all the old-growth forest in the watershed is now gone, and the forests that remain are mostly second-growth stands.|$|E

He subsequently suffered panic disorders and flashbacks as a result.|$|E
5|$|With {{the gradual}} {{growth of the}} {{electrification}} of the inner London suburban lines after 1915, the class tended to be used on stopping trains on the LSWR main line, and on services to Guildford and Reading. After {{the formation of the}} Southern Railway in 1923 the class gradually began to be used, further afield, notably in the west of England, but also on <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> in Kent, and on the former South Eastern and Chatham Railway line between Redhill and Reading.|$|E
5|$|A {{small number}} of private {{railways}} have also existed at various times. Some, such as the Geelong and Melbourne Railway Company, and the Melbourne and Suburban Railway Company, Melbourne and Hobson's Bay Railway Company, Melbourne and Essendon Railway Company and St Kilda and Brighton Railway Company were acquired by the Victorian Railways and made part of the core state network in 1860 and 1878 respectively. Other country <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> were also built by private companies: namely the Kerang-Koondrook Tramway and the Deniliquin and Moama Railway, both not being acquired until the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for the driver to drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E
5|$|Dieselisation {{occurred}} from 1951 {{with the}} F class shunter, but the B and S classes of 1952 and 1957 revolutionised main line operations.

Apart from the F class, Clyde Engineering has had a monopoly on Victorian diesel-electric locos. as the Australian licensee of General Motors EMD engines and traction motors, fitting them into locally designed bodies. By the 1980s the first generation locomotives were approaching {{the end of their}} lives, with the electric locomotives withdrawn by 1988, and the modern N and G classes allowing the withdrawal of lower power T and Y classes.|$|E
5|$|Due in {{no small}} part to the {{presence}} of the station, South Framingham eclipsed Framingham Center in size; on January 8, 1915, the station was renamed Framingham. Traffic on the B and its various <b>branch</b> <b>lines,</b> though, decreased after World War I. In 1919, Agricultural Branch trains were cut to Framingham, requiring a transfer to continue Boston or Mansfield. The line was cut back to Marlborough in 1931, and passenger service ended in 1937. Passenger service on the Mansfield & Framingham ended in 1933. The Milford Branch lasted the longest of the Boston & Albany branch lines; it was cut to one daily trip in 1953 and terminated in April 1959.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{successful}} use of superheating on other Drummond classes, Robert Urie experimentally fitted a superheated boiler to No.126 in December 1920, {{together with an}} extended smokebox and larger cylinders. The additional weight of the new boiler raised the centre of gravity of the locomotive, thereby adding to problems of instability on faster main line trains, whilst simultaneously preventing its use on many <b>branch</b> <b>lines.</b> As a result, no further examples were fitted, and No.126 was eventually broken up for spare parts in 1937. In 1931 No. 672 was experimentally fitted with the Strowger-Hudd Automatic Warning System, but the equipment was not adopted by the Southern Railway and the equipment later removed.|$|E
5|$|Framingham Railroad Station is a {{historic}} Boston and Albany Railroad station located in downtown Framingham, Massachusetts. Designed by noted American architect H. H.

The station, built in 1884â85, served as a major stop on the B Main Line as well as a hub for <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> to Milford, Mansfield, Fitchburg, and Lowell. After years of deterioration, the station was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975, and restored a decade later.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} half of the twentieth century, the {{extractive}} industries of the West of Scotland underwent a metamorphosis. The small pits were either worked out or were mechanised and merged. A similar process took place in the iron and steel production industries, and the medium scale iron works in many locations closed down. Many railway <b>branch</b> <b>lines</b> had been heavily dependent on business from the mineral industries, and could not be sustained when they had gone, but some continued as passenger lines where they served sizable communities.|$|E
