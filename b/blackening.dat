5|$|Machine Head entered Sharkbite Studios in Oakland, California on August 21 {{to begin}} {{recording}} The <b>Blackening,</b> with Flynn assuming production duties {{for the second}} time. From twenty six written songs, the selection was whittled down to eight. McClain completed the drum tracks to six of the eight tracks on August 25, followed by the remaining two the next day. Tracking concluded on November 16, 2006.|$|E
5|$|The line Ashes, Ashes {{in colonial}} {{versions}} of the rhyme is claimed to refer variously to cremation of the bodies, the burning of victims' houses, or <b>blackening</b> of their skin, and the theory has been adapted {{to be applied to}} other {{versions of the}} rhyme. In its various forms, the interpretation has entered into popular culture and has been used elsewhere to make oblique reference to the plague.|$|E

50|$|Their debut album, <b>Blacken</b> the Sun, was {{released}} on October 28, 2008 under Luxor Records. Produced by the band’s own guitarist, Nick Morris, owner of Cloud City Studios (The Black Dahlia Murder, Walls of Jericho). <b>Blacken</b> The Sun was moderately successful and defined the band’s unique death metal style. After <b>Blacken</b> the Sun, the band signed to Solid State Records. Their highly acclaimed sophomore album, Dynasty {{was released}} in 2010, before leaving Solid State, and re-signing to Luxor.|$|R
5|$|Machine Head {{increased}} {{the complexity and}} technicality in their sound for the next album, The <b>Blackening,</b> which partially changes {{the sound of their}} first 5 albums in favor of a more classic heavy metal and thrash metal oriented sound, with fully complex song structures and guitar riffs. Unto the Locust features heavier, faster and more complex riffs by both Robb Flynn and Phil Demmel, influenced by classical music, and supported by fast and complex drum patterns by Dave McClain. This is also the first Machine Head's record to include blast beats.|$|E
5|$|The album did {{exceptionally}} well overseas where it entered the Mainstream Top 20 in the German and Belgium charts at No. 12, No. 14 in Australia, No. 16 in the United Kingdom and No. 19 in Sweden. Charting positions below the Top 20 consisted of Ireland at No. 23, No. 29 in the Netherlands, No. 34 in France and No. 55 in Italy. The <b>Blackening</b> sold more copies {{in two weeks}} than Through the Ashes of Empires sold in three years.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that, in 12 workers exposed for two or more years to acetic acid airborne average concentration of 51 ppm (estimated), produced symptoms of conjunctive irritation, upper respiratory tract irritation, and hyperkeratotic dermatitis. Exposure to 50 ppm or more is intolerable to most persons and results in intensive lacrimation and irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, with pharyngeal oedema and chronic bronchitis. Unacclimatised humans experience extreme eye and nasal irritation at concentrations in excess of 25 ppm, and conjunctivitis from concentrations below 10 ppm {{has been reported}}. In a study of five workers exposed for seven to 12 years to concentrations of 80 to 200 ppm at peaks, the principal findings were <b>blackening</b> and hyperkeratosis of {{the skin of the}} hands, conjunctivitis (but no corneal damage), bronchitis and pharyngitis, and erosion of the exposed teeth (incisors and canines).|$|E

5|$|Several {{species of}} fungi infect {{the roots of}} waratahs, causing {{significant}} plant morbidity or death. Typical symptoms include yellow leaves, wilting, <b>blackening</b> and dieback or part {{or all of the}} plant, or lack of proteoid roots. The most common pathogen is the soil-borne water mold Phytophthora cinnamomi, which appears to be more problematic in cultivated plants than in wild populations. Mass plantings at the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney and at Mount Annan planted before the 2000 Summer Olympics were devastated by the disease. Rhizoctonia solani can cause damping off or root rot, and is an uncommon pathogen. Cylindrocarpon scoparium and C. destructans (now Nectria radicicola) are also uncommon causes of infection and result in decay of the crown of the plant. Although significant problems, fungi {{are less likely to be}} the cause of plant morbidity than poor drainage or soil conditions.|$|E
5|$|Under Operation Peppermint, orders {{went out}} for medical {{personnel}} to report the details of any fogging or <b>blackening</b> of photographic or X-ray film, and medical officers were ordered to report diseases of unknown etiology involving fatigue, nausea, leukopenia or erythema. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which were used to measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in readiness to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Peterson instructed Chemical Warfare Service personnel {{in the use of}} the equipment, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance.|$|E
5|$|Shastri's assurances {{calmed down}} the {{volatile}} situation. On 12 February, the students council postponed the agitation indefinitely and on 16 February, C. Subramaniam and O. V. Alagesan withdrew their resignations. Sporadic acts of protests and violence continued to happen throughout February and early March. On 7 March, the administration withdrew {{all the cases}} filed against the student leaders and on 14 March, the Anti-Hindi imposition Agitation Council dropped the agitation. Shastri's climbdown angered the pro-Hindi activists in North India. Members of Jan Sangh went about the streets of New Delhi, <b>blackening</b> out English signs with tar. The agitation slowly changed into a general anti-Congress organisation. In the 1967 election, student leader P. Seenivasan contested against Kamaraj in the Virudhunagar constituency. A large number of students {{from all over the}} state campaigned for him and ensured his victory: the Congress party was defeated and DMK came to power {{for the first time in}} Madras State.|$|E

5|$|Demands for Hitler to {{constrain}} the SA strengthened. Conservatives in the army, industry, and politics placed Hitler under increasing pressure {{to reduce the}} influence of the SA and to move against Röhm. While Röhm's homosexuality did not endear him to conservatives, they were more concerned about his political ambitions. Hitler for his part remained indecisive and uncertain about just what precisely he wanted to do when he left for Venice to meet Benito Mussolini on June 15. Before Hitler left, and at the request of Presidential State Secretary Otto Meißner, Foreign Minister Baron Konstantin von Neurath ordered the German Ambassador to Italy Ulrich von Hassell— without Hitler's knowledge— to ask Mussolini to tell Hitler that the SA was <b>blackening</b> Germany's good name. Neurath's manoeuvre to put pressure on Hitler paid off, with Mussolini agreeing to the request (Neurath was a former ambassador to Italy, and knew Mussolini well). During the summit in Venice, Mussolini upbraided Hitler for tolerating the violence, hooliganism, and homosexuality of the SA, which Mussolini stated were ruining Hitler's good reputation all over the world. Mussolini used the affair occasioned by the murder of Giacomo Matteotti {{as an example of the}} kind of trouble unruly followers could cause a dictator. While Mussolini's criticism did not win Hitler over to acting against the SA, it helped push him in that direction.|$|E
25|$|In a {{conventional}} lamp, the evaporated tungsten eventually condenses {{on the inner}} surface of the glass envelope, darkening it. For bulbs that contain a vacuum, the darkening is uniform across the entire surface of the envelope. When a filling of inert gas is used, the evaporated tungsten is carried in the thermal convection currents of the gas, depositing preferentially on the uppermost part of the envelope and <b>blackening</b> just {{that portion of the}} envelope. An incandescent lamp that gives 93% or less of its initial light output at 75% of its rated life is regarded as unsatisfactory, when tested according to IEC Publication 60064. Light loss is due to filament evaporation and bulb <b>blackening.</b> Study of the problem of bulb <b>blackening</b> led to the discovery of the Edison effect, thermionic emission and invention of the vacuum tube.|$|E

25|$|The first {{electric}} headlamp {{light source}} was the tungsten filament, {{operating in a}} vacuum or inert-gas atmosphere inside the headlamp bulb or sealed beam. Compared to newer-technology light sources, tungsten filaments give off small amounts of light relative to the power they consume. Also, during normal operation of such lamps, tungsten boils off {{the surface of the}} filament and condenses on the bulb glass, <b>blackening</b> it. This reduces the light output of the filament and blocks some of the light that would pass through an unblackened bulb glass, though <b>blackening</b> was less of a problem in sealed beam units; their large interior surface area minimized the thickness of the tungsten accumulation. For these reasons, plain tungsten filaments are all but obsolete in automotive headlamp service.|$|E
