The dances were not the {{original}} either <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Antonio Cortesi. It {{is possible that the}} ballet was first staged in the provincial theatres. This, however, is not known with certainty.|$|E
5|$|After the election, Roosevelt {{continued}} to promote progressive ideals, a New Nationalism, much to Taft's dismay. Roosevelt attacked his successor's administration, arguing that its guiding principles were {{not that of}} the party of Lincoln, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Gilded Age. The feud continued on and off through 1911, {{a year in which}} there were few elections of significance. Wisconsin Senator La Follette announced a presidential run as a Republican, and was backed by a convention of progressives. Roosevelt began to move into a position for a run in late 1911, writing that the tradition that presidents not run for a third term only applied to consecutive terms.|$|E
5|$|On 29 September 1940, a mid-air {{collision}} occurred over Brocklesby, New South Wales, Australia. The accident was unusual {{in that the}} aircraft involved, two Avro Ansons of No.2 Service Flying Training School RAAF, remained locked together after colliding, and then landed safely. The collision stopped the engines of the upper Anson, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the machine underneath continued to run, allowing the pair of aircraft to keep flying. Both navigators and the pilot of the lower Anson bailed out. The pilot of the upper Anson {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft with his ailerons and flaps, and made an emergency landing in a nearby paddock. All four crewmen survived the incident, and the upper Anson was repaired and returned to flight service.|$|E

5|$|Sontheimer {{suggests}} that the cult of Khandoba is at least older than 12th century, which can be determined by references in Jain and Lingayat texts and inscriptions. A 12th-century Jain author Brahmashiva claims that a Jain, who died in battle after a display of his valour, was later named as Mailara. By the 13th century, wide worship of Malhari or Mailara is observed by kings, Brahmins, simple folk and warriors. With the rise of Muslim empire, classical Hindu temples fell into ruin, giving rise to the folk religion such as of Khandoba. Chakradhara remarks, 'by {{the end of the}} Kali Yuga, temples of Vishnu and Shiva will be destroyed, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Mailara will stay'. A 1369 AD inscription at Ailoni near Warangal tells an account of Mallari different from Malhari Mahatmya— Shiva helped the epic hero Arjuna kill the demon Malla, thus acquiring the title of Mallari. Mailara was the family deity of Kakatiya dynasty (1083–1323 AD); a text from their rule records the self-torture rituals of Mailara-devotees and describes the deity. Throughout his development, Mailara is looked upon as a lower manifestation of Ishvara (God) by Lingayat and Maharashtrian bhakti saints.|$|E
5|$|The PlayStation 3 version {{supports}} display {{resolutions of}} 720p and 1080p – the former with {{and the latter}} without anti-aliasing – while the Vita version runs at 720x408 pixels. Graphical features such as the water effects and lighting were improved. Other changes include the addition of bloom, the move from circular to dynamic shadows and tweaks to environmental geometry and texturing. The developers revised the 3D models for both games: most models merely received new textures <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the playable characters were rebuilt completely with noticeable changes to their faces. The cutscenes and prerendered environments needed to be adjusted from a 4:3 to a 16:9 screen ratio, the process of which required lots of art and programming readjustments. For example, the widescreen display led to character models being visible in a cutscene although they were to appear only in a later shot; these instances had to be corrected. Both the prerendered background images and cutscenes were cropped {{at the top and}} bottom to fit the new screen ratio. However, they received a bump in resolution to appear much clearer than in the PlayStation 2 version. The gameplay also needed to be duplicated while bringing it up to the standard of a high definition game, which was harder than the team thought.|$|E
5|$|The pelagic {{stingray}} {{has a very}} thick, distinctively wedge-shaped pectoral fin disc one-third wider than long, with broadly curved leading margins, rather angular outer corners, and nearly straight trailing margins. The snout is short with a rounded tip. The eyes are minute and, unlike in other stingrays, do not protrude above the body; the spiracles (paired respiratory openings) follow immediate behind. There is a short but broad curtain of skin between the nostrils, with a weakly fringed rear margin. The mouth is small and gently arched, with deep furrows at the corners and a tiny projection {{at the center of}} the upper jaw that fits into an indentation on the lower jaw. There are anywhere from 0 to 15 forked papillae (nipple-like structures) in a row across the floor of the mouth. There are 2534 upper tooth rows and 2531 lower tooth rows; the teeth of both sexes have single, pointed cusps, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> adult males are longer and sharper than those of adult females. The margins of the pelvic fins are nearly straight in front and become rounded at the tips and in back.|$|E

25|$|Scholars {{generally}} {{believe that}} the Abhidharma emerged after {{the time of the}} Buddha, in around the 3rd century BCE. Therefore, the seven Abhidhamma works are generally claimed by scholars not to represent the words of the Buddha himself, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> disciples and scholars. Factors contributing to its development could have been the growth of monastic centers, the growing support for the Buddhist sangha, and outside influences from other religious groups.|$|E

25|$|There were {{intended}} to be four Medici tombs, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Lorenzo the Magnificent and his brother Giuliano (modestly buried beneath the altar at the entrance wall) were never begun. The {{result is that the}} two magnificent existing tombs are those of comparatively insignificant Medici: Lorenzo di Piero, Duke of Urbino and Giuliano di Lorenzo, Duke of Nemours. Their architectural components are similar; their sculptures offer contrast. On an unfinished wall, Michelangelo's Madonna and Child flanked by the Medici patron saints Cosmas and Damian, executed by Giovanni Angelo Montorsoli and Raffaello da Montelupo respectively, to Michelangelo's models, are set over their plain rectangular tomb.|$|E
25|$|A {{graveyard}} {{was situated}} to the north-east of the church, with {{the graves of}} the Audley family and senior clergy members being found in the church itself. The excavation works between 1987 and 1994 uncovered the remains of 91 individuals; the large proportion were of men <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> women and children have also been identified. A number of artifacts have been discovered with the excavated burials, including a pilgrim's staff and a wax chalice. A wax seal, with the impression {{of the church of}} Santo Spirito in Sassia, Rome, was found with one set of remains. Professor John Cherry has posited that the seal was attached to an indulgence obtained whilst on a pilgrimage.|$|E
25|$|Dockyard {{facilities}} {{were also used}} to resupply and victual the navy's warships; Deptford's Victualling Yard was founded upstream of the main dockyard: the Victualling Board leased the Red House estate in 1743 and established its main depot at Deptford, embarking {{on the construction of}} stores and mills. In time, the two yards became physically merged as the dockyard expanded in the victualling yard, both being enclosed by a wall. Deptford's proximity to the food markets of London made it especially convenient for victualling, and it served the requirements not only of its own neighbouring Dockyard, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Woolwich, Sheerness and Chatham as well. In 1858 it was renamed the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard, following similar re-brandings in Plymouth, Portsmouth and Ireland.|$|E

25|$|The {{provisions}} of the Jencks Act have been substantially incorporated into Rule 26.2 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This {{is due to the}} notion that provisions which are purely procedural in nature should appear in the Rules, rather than in Title 18 of the United States Code. Rule 26.2 extends the {{provisions of}} the Jencks Act by providing that statements subject to production at trial are not only those of prosecution witnesses, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> any witness other than the defendant. The Rule does not alter the Jencks Act schedule for production of statements, nor does it relieve a defendant seeking production of Jencks material from the necessity of making a request for production at the trial stage of the proceeding.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to this rejection, the bishops issued a unanimous statement, asserting the Church of England's right to order its forms of worship and, in 1929, the Upper House of the Convocation of Canterbury resolved that bishops might approve {{the use of the}} 1928 book, notwithstanding the lack of parliamentary authority. It became common for prayer books to be printed with the 1662 and 1928 forms of service in parallel columns, although the legal basis of the revision remained unclear. The 1928 revised forms of Matrimony and Baptism were quite widely adopted, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> other rites tended not to be; the consequence, in practice, being very wide variation in liturgical practice from parish to parish, with very few clergy adhering consistently to the strict observation of either the 1662 or the 1928 forms of worship.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, some 245 {{newspapers}} and magazines (compared to only 91 in 1987) are 90% owned by private groups and independents. The Tunisian political parties {{have the right to}} publish their own newspapers, <b>but</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the opposition parties have very limited editions (like Al Mawkif or Mouwatinoun). Before the recent democratic transition, although freedom of the press was formally guaranteed by the constitution, almost all newspapers have in practice followed the government line report. Critical approach to the activities of the president, government and the Constitutional Democratic Rally Party (then in power) were suppressed. In essence, the media was dominated by state authorities through the Agence Tunis Afrique Presse. This has changed since, as the media censorship by the authorities have been largely abolished, and self-censorship has significantly decreased. Nonetheless, the current regulatory framework and social and political culture mean that the future of press and media freedom is still unclear.|$|E
