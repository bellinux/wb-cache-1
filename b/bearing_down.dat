5|$|At 21:30 Forte and the {{captured}} merchant ships were visible from Sybille, Forte brilliantly illuminated {{in the tropical}} night. Cooke brought Sybille westwards {{in order to take}} the weather gage before wearing and <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on the French ship, under a light wind from the southwest. Despite the illumination on the French ship, Sybilles sails were clearly identified on Forte but Beaulieu gave no orders to prepare for action: he seems to have thought that the sails belonged to an approaching East Indiaman despite the concerns of his officers, or that he wished to lure Sybille close enough to ensure its defeat in the coming engagement.|$|E
5|$|With Tropical Storm Cristobal <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on the {{recovery}} team, {{and time and}} money running out, the team {{made the decision to}} raise the turret on 5 August 2002, after 41 days of work, and the gun turret broke the surface at 5:30pm to the cheers of everyone aboard Wotan and other recovery ships nearby. As archaeologists examined the contents of the turret after it has been landed aboard Wotan, they discovered a second skeleton, but removing it did not begin until the turret arrived at the Mariners' Museum for conservation. The remains of these sailors were transferred to the Joint POW/MIA Accounting Command (JPAC) at Hickam Air Force Base, Hawaii, in the hope that they could be identified.|$|E
5|$|Having finally eluded his pursuers, Bompart made {{directly}} for Lough Swilly where the landing {{was scheduled to}} take place. Unaware of the rebellion's defeat, he hoped that Humbert's army would be operating in the Lough Swilly area, as intended in the campaign planned before Humbert left France. Arriving off the coast, Bompart searched for a suitable landing site {{but was unable to}} find one before dark on 10 October. He waited out the night close to Tory Island, but was surprised the next day by sails on the horizon; Warren's squadron had been joined by Countess's ships, and an overwhelming force was <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on the French. Abandoning all notions of landing the troops, Bompart hauled his ships close to the wind to give them room to manoeuvre and allow their captains as much opportunity as possible to escape the approaching British.|$|E

5|$|Laforey {{immediately}} advanced on {{the strange}} sails, which were soon {{revealed to be}} Castor and the Dutch merchant ship. With Carysfort <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on him L'Huillier cast off the tow and prepared for battle, meeting the approaching British frigate with a broadside. The engagement was fought at close range and with little manoeuvering by either side, the ships exchanging broadsides {{for an hour and}} fifteen minutes before L'Huillier surrendered. His ship was heavily battered in the exchange, with the main topgallantmast knocked down and the mainmast and hull severely damaged. Carysfort suffered just one man killed and four wounded from the understrength crew of 180, while casualties were much heavier among the approximately 200 men aboard Castor, the French losing 16 men killed and nine wounded. The Dutch ship initially escaped, but was later captured and its value was eventually included in the prize money paid for Castor.|$|E
5|$|The {{unexpected}} {{success of}} her first book, No Logo (1999), extended author and journalist Naomi Klein's book tour beyond its original two-week schedule. She spent the next 30 months traveling the world promoting the book as well as writing newspaper articles covering the anti-globalization movement. Most of her articles were originally published in the Canadian national newspaper The Globe and Mail, while some were published by The Nation, The New York Times, and The Guardian. During this time she resisted her publisher's urgings to write a new book, and the pressure to match No Logos success was <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> upon her. She relented to the pressure for another publication by collecting {{the best of the}} articles and speeches she had written since No Logo. She did not intend this new book to be a sequel or follow-up, but rather a stand alone collection of writing.|$|E
5|$|At 17:00, {{the leading}} French ship of the line, Magnanime, came within range with her bow chasers. Calcutta {{continued}} sailing southwards, remaining {{ahead of the}} squadron but not at a sufficient distance to avoid Magnanimes fire. Realising that unless he took drastic measures his ship would be caught, Woodriff turned Calcutta back towards Magnanime, hoping to disable her before the next ship in line, the frigate Thétis, could join the battle. Captain Pierre-François Violette on Magnanime prepared to meet Calcutta and the engagement rapidly became furious, Calcutta and Magnanime exchanging full broadsides at close range. Within 45 minutes, {{it was clear that}} Woodriff's gamble had failed. The larger and more powerful Magnanime inflicted severe damage to the British ship's rigging, rendering her unable to manoeuvre or escape, with the remainder of the French squadron <b>bearing</b> <b>down.</b> With defeat inevitable, Woodriff spared the lives of his men by striking his colours and surrendering to Violette. Although Calcutta was badly damaged among her rigging and sails, her hull had suffered little from the engagement and she had only lost six killed and six wounded. French casualties were negligible, although Armide was forced to undergo extensive temporary repairs on her own sails and rigging before she was able to operate as a scout once more. Brothers had also been captured: the corvette Sylphe had separated during the chase and rapidly overhauled the lumbering merchant ship, which had surrendered without a fight.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to hold the camera steady, giving the visual impression of a truck <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E
5|$|In the fifth-round match, {{the teams}} saw out a 0–0 draw at Maine Road, and the match was replayed at Anfield. Goals from Jack Dyson and Bobby Johnstone gave Manchester City a 2–1 lead, {{but the game}} {{finished}} in controversial circumstances when the referee blew his whistle for full time as Liverpool's Billy Liddell was <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on goal. Liddell put {{the ball in the}} net, but unbeknown to him the goal did not count as the match was already over. In the quarter final Manchester City again played opposition from Liverpool, facing Everton at Maine Road. Trailing 1–0 at half-time after a Jimmy Harris goal, City overcame the deficit in the second half with goals from Hayes and Johnstone. Further controversy followed in the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, when in the final minutes of the match, with the score at 1–0 to Manchester City, Tottenham were denied a penalty after goalkeeper Trautmann grabbed forward George Robb's leg. No further goalscoring opportunities occurred, and City hung on for the victory.|$|E
5|$|On July 4, David {{demonstrates}} {{that the key to}} defeating the aliens lies in deactivating their force fields, and devises a way to do so by uploading a computer virus into the mothership. He proposes using the refurbished alien fighter to implement the plan, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The two are able to upload the virus and deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership. With military pilots in short supply, Thomas enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, and leads an attack on a saucer <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on Area 51. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighters are able to inflict damage, but their supply of missiles is quickly exhausted. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but his attempt of firing it jams, leaving him no choice but to sacrifice his own life. He flies his plane kamikaze-style into the directed-energy weapon port, which results in an explosion that destroys the saucer. Human resistance forces around the world successfully destroy the other saucers using this vulnerability. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They and military officers nearby accompany Thomas and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a fireworks display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.|$|E

60|$|She did {{not mean}} to do so. She evidently meant to turn the tables by <b>bearing</b> {{suddenly}} <b>down</b> on us, and, if possible, give us a broadside before we could get out of range. The captain saw the intention instantly, and thwarted it.|$|R
60|$|This he did. He paddled, {{with all}} his strength, {{to get into a}} line with {{the upper end of the}} island, the current, all the time, <b>bearing</b> him <b>down</b> {{directly}} towards it. In a few minutes, he had the satisfaction of seeing that he was going directly upon it.|$|R
5|$|The Batavian captain, finding {{such a large}} force <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on him, {{ordered the}} brigs and cutter to {{separate}} from the frigate, turning with the wind {{in an effort to}} escape with Donnelly close behind. He also turned Argo away from the pursuing Phoenix, but was unable to decide whether to fight or flee and as a result changed course a number of times. This inevitably slowed his ship, and at 08:15 Phoenix was able to come alongside with the advantage of the weather gage. Halstead fired a shot across the Batavian ship's bow as a warning to surrender to such overwhelming odds, but the Batavian captain refused and opened fire on the British frigate. Although Argo made strenuous efforts to escape during the exchange of fire, Halstead's ship was both more accurate and effective, mounting 36 18-pounder cannon and 8 32-pounder carronades to the Batavian frigate's 12-pounder main battery supplemented with a number of cannon of lower calibres. In just 20 minutes, Phoenix had torn much of Argos rigging, sails and masts and inflicted heavy casualties of eight killed and 28 wounded. With his ship damaged, Duncan's fleet in sight and Leopard not far behind Phoenix, the Batavian captain surrendered at 08:35, allowing Halstead to take possession of his vessel.|$|E

40|$|In two experiments, rats {{were trained}} to deposit ball <b>bearings</b> <b>down</b> {{a hole in the}} floor, using an {{algorithmic}} version of shaping. The experimenter coded responses expected to be precursors of the target response, ball bearing deposit; a computer program reinforced these responses, or not, according to an algorithm that mimicked the processes thought to occur in conventional shaping. In the first experiment, 8 of 10 rats were successfully shaped; in the second, 5 of 5 were successfully shaped, and the median number of sessions required was the same as for a control group trained using conventional shaping. In both experiments, “misbehavior,” that is, excessive handling and chewing of the ball bearings, was observed, and when the algorithmic shaping procedure was used, misbehavior could be shown to occur in spite of reduced reinforcement for the responses involved...|$|R
50|$|Cross-bolting has two advantages: it couples the {{two sides}} of the {{crankcase}} together, making it stiffer overall and less prone to twisting. Secondly it helps to hold the <b>bearing</b> cap <b>down</b> against the downward force from the piston. This second advantage is usually only possible with blind bolts, as the dowel effect of a through bolt is less effective.|$|R

25|$|In Byzantine sources, {{the adversary}} of Gello is often St. Sisinnius or Sisoe, whose defeat of her is his most renowned deed. On amulets, Sisinnius is {{depicted}} as a horseman <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> with his spear on the female demon, who has fish- or serpent-like attributes below the waist. In one Byzantine folktale, Gello slips into a heavily guarded castle by disguising herself as a fly on the saint's horse, since only Sisinnius could pass through the gate.|$|E

50|$|Ravage is {{launched}} to Earth by Soundwave {{with the}} objective to steal an Allspark shard. He lands in the ocean near the NEST HQ in Diego Garica, and quickly jumps the fence. He searches the area, coming to a ventilation pipe {{that leads to the}} Allspark shard room. He disgorges thousands of what appear to be ball <b>bearings</b> <b>down</b> the pipe. These tiny transformers known as the Microcons, combine into a razor-thin robot (named Reedman) which acquires the shard, and escapes the base. Ravage covers their retreat as he heads to the Constructicons before accompanying them to revive Megatron. Ravage also deploys Scalpel when they find Megatron. Ravage appears at the final battle, when Bumblebee is amidst the fight with Rampage. Ravage jumps onto Bumblebee's back and attacks him violently. Bumblebee grabs Ravage and rips out his tail, pulling out his spine with it, killing him. Bumblebee is seen using the tail as a whip briefly against Rampage.|$|R
25|$|While Hurricane Irma was <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> {{on south}} Florida on September 8, 2017, an opinion piece in The New York Times {{observed}} that Turkey Point {{is vulnerable to}} the threat of a storm-caused nuclear meltdown. The Turkey Point nuclear power station sits on an exposed island in Biscayne Bay, about 25 miles south of Miami. Built in the early 1970s, the aging plant depends on similar vulnerable backup systems to prevent a meltdown as those of Japan’s Fukushima plant. Although Turkey Point’s main reactors are 20 feet above sea level, the plant’s diesel-powered backup generators, which keep cooling water circulating through the reactors when power is knocked out, are less elevated and less well insulated, according to Phil Stoddard, the mayor of South Miami.|$|E
25|$|Joseph and Jourdan posted Gazan's Army of the South and d'Erlon's Army of the Center {{to cover}} Valladolid and Segovia, while Reille with the {{remaining}} 17,000 troops from the Army of Portugal {{was sent to the}} north to help suppress guerillas. At this time, Clausel's 20,000 soldiers were located near Pamplona, far to the east. Hill's wing seized Salamanca on 26 May 1813, chasing Eugene-Casimir Villatte's French troops out of the city and capturing 200 French soldiers. Meanwhile, Graham's soldiers forded the flooding Esla River at Almendra on 31 May, losing some men to drowning and much equipment. Augustin Darricau, whose division held Zamora, had sent a cavalry reconnaissance to the west on 20 May that reported no enemy activity. The French horsemen just missed Graham, who crossed the Douro soon afterward. Finally alerted that 64,000 men were <b>bearing</b> <b>down</b> on Zamora from the northwest, Darricau bolted to the east, leaving Graham to occupy the town on the morning of 2 June.|$|E
25|$|A hernia is the {{abnormal}} exit {{of tissue}} or an organ, {{such as the}} bowel, through {{the wall of the}} cavity in which it normally resides. Hernias come {{in a number of different}} types. Most commonly they involve the abdomen, specifically the groin. Groin hernias are most common of the inguinal type but may also be femoral. Other hernias include hiatus, incisional, and umbilical hernias. Symptoms are present in about 66% of people with groin hernias. This may include pain or discomfort especially with coughing, exercise, or going to the bathroom. Often it gets worse throughout the day and improves when lying down. A bulging area may occur that becomes larger when <b>bearing</b> <b>down.</b> Groin hernias occur more often on the right than left side. The main concern is strangulation, where the blood supply to part of the bowel is blocked. This usually produces severe pain and tenderness of the area. Hiatus or hiatal hernias often result in heartburn but may also cause chest pain or pain with eating.|$|E
