40|$|The {{stability}} of metal–humate complexes {{is an important}} factor determining and predicting speciation, mobility and bioavailability of heavy metals in the environment. A comparative investigation of the complexation of Cu(II) and Pb(II) with humic acid and humic-like ligands, such as <b>benzoic</b> <b>and</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid,</b> was performed. The analysis was realized at pH 4. 0, a temperature of 25 °C and at an ionic strength of 0. 01 mol dm- 3 (NaCl) using the Schubert ion-exchange method and its modified form. The stability constants were calculated from the experimental data by the Schubert method for complexes with benzoic and humic acid. A modified Schubert method was used for the determination of the stability constants of the complexes with salicylic acid. It was found that Cu(II) and Pb(II) form mononuclear complexes with benzoic and humic acid while with salicylic acid both metals form polynuclear complexes. The results indicate that Pb(II) has a higher binding ability than Cu(II) to all the investigated ligands. The Cu(II) –salicylate and Pb(II) –salicylate complexes showed noticeable higher stability constants compared with their complexes with humic acid, while the stabilities of the complexes with benzoic acid differed less. Salicylic and benzoic acids as humic-like ligands can be used for setting the range of stability constants of humic complexes with Cu(II) and Pb(II) ...|$|E

Other hydroxybenzoic acids as well as aminobenzoic acids are without effect. <b>Benzoic</b> <b>and</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> are not oxidized by these pathogenic strains, so presumably they act to catalyze some endogenous meta-bolic reaction of the cell. A Mycobacterium obtained from the collection of Dr. Van Niel, recently identified as M. lacticola, oxidizes benzoic, m- and p-hydroxy-benzoic acids but not salicylic acid (Bernheim, 1942). The first three acids can act as the sole carbon sources for the growth of this species (Saz and Bernheim, 1942). The metabolism of a number of other mycobacteria with respect to these compounds may be said to be intermediate between that of M. lacticola and the pathogenic strains in the sense that benzoic acid is oxidized by them but the hydroxy acids are not, although some of the latter may increase the oxygen uptake. Lehmann (1946) has found essentially the same effects in the myco-bacteria he has studied.

40|$|The uptake of each {{of eleven}} {{structurally}} related solutes from pH 1 donor solution by an invariant liquid membrane formulation was investigated. The presence of polyamino surfactants in liquid membrane formulation significantly altered the partition of solutes between aqueous phase <b>and</b> oil phase. <b>Benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> followed monoexponentiai kinetics while the uptake of other solutes followed biexponential processes, except p-aminobenzoic acid which was not transported at all. Both <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> were removed with a much faster rate compared to other solutes. Approximately, 90 % of these solutes were removed in two and half minutes from the donor solution. It is proposed {{that the presence of}} a phenolic group allowed <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> to be transported with a significantly high rate as it can form intramolecular hydrogen bonding which increases its solubility in non-polar solvents. This is supported by the fact that meta and para-hydroxybenzoic acids were removed at a much slower rate. As expected, p-amino benzoic acid was not transported through liquid membrane from an acidic donor solution probably because of the ionized amino group. In presence of methyl p-hydroxybenzoate, ethyl p-hydroxybenzoate, acetaminophen and salicylamide rupture of the liquid membrane was apparent. This is possibly due to the formation of alcohols in the internal aqueous phase when these esters react with the encapsulated buffer. From the data obtained, it appears that the apparent leakage follows zero order kinetics. A new and more sophisticated kinetic model is proposed in an attempt to rationalize the basic mechanisms behind the solute uptake by the liquid membranes. The data for <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> <b>and</b> acetylsalicylic acid were analyzed by this model. Benzoic acid was not fit by this model.

The increment of growth parameter was associated with elevated levels of growth promoters (IAA, GA 3, total cytokinins) and low level of ABA. The greatest increase in the previously mentioned parameters was measured in plants exposed to different concentrations of phenols particularly in benzoic acid-treated plants. Such effect was concentration dependent. All treatments led to significant increments in yield seeds and oil content. Moreover, gas liquid chromatographic analysis revealed that the main identified components of essential oil were 2, 2 -dimethyl butanoic acid, isobutyl isobutyrate, α-isophorone, thymol, fenchyl acetate and linalool.

Objective: The present study focused on the identification of individual flavonoids and phenolic acids from seven commercial varieties of pearl millet and five samples of pearl millet-based traditional recipes of Banaskantha, Gujarat, India. Methods: Total phenols were determined by the Folin-Ciocalteu method, and individual polyphenol separation included the isolation and identification of (a) flavonoids, (b) phenolic acids, and (c) glycoflavones involving interaction with diagnostic reagents and paper chromatographic separation of compounds and their UV-visible spectroscopic studies including hypsochromic and bathchromic shifts with reagents such as AlCl 3, AlCl 3 /HCl, NaOMe, NaOAc,and NaOAc/H 3 PO 3. Five traditional recipes consumed in the pearl millet producing belt of Banaskantha, Gujarat, India, were standardized in the laboratory and analyzed for phenol and individual flavonoids.

Six hours after infiltration with 300 mM H 2 O 2, the levels of BA and SA in leaves increased 5 -fold over the levels detected in control leaves. The accumulation of BA and SA was preceded by the rapid activation of benzoic acid 2 -hydroxylase (BA 2 H) in the H 2 O 2 -infiltrated tissues. This enzyme catalyzes the formation of SA from BA. Enzyme activation could be reproduced in vitro by addition of H 2 O 2 or cumene hydroperoxide to the assay mixture. H 2 O 2 was most effective in vitro when applied at 6 mM. In vitro activation of BA 2 H by peroxides was inhibited by the catalase inhibitor 3 -amino- 1, 2, 4 -triazole. We suggest that H 2 O 2 activates SA biosynthesis via two mechanisms.

First the spectroscopic model was validated on the interaction of simple molecules representing the structural components of humic acid such as <b>benzoic</b> <b>acid,</b> catechol <b>and</b> <b>salicylic</b> <b>acid</b> with mercury. The interaction of carboxylic parts of humic acid with mercury is very interesting and easily characterised by infrared spectroscopy, an ideal mean for molecular study. Under the salt form (commercial humic acid Fluka TM: FHA), humic acid reacts with mercury {{in a different way}} from its acid form (FHA purified noted PFHA) and the Leonardite (LHA). Because of the straightforward exchange between Na +, Ca 2 + and Hg 2 +, fixation of the latter is much more important with the salt form (FHA). However, this reaction is reduced under the acid form (PFHA, LHA) because the exchange with protons is difficult. The effect of this exchange was studied by FTIR showing the intensity decrease of ν c=o (—COOH), the carboxylic functional group band of the acid, and the shifting of ν as (—COO −), the carboxylate functional group band under given pH and mercury conditions. For the FHA salt form, the characteristic band ν c=o (—COOH) represented by a shoulder did not evolute, whereas the corresponding band to ν as (—COO −) strongly shifted (40 cm − 1) for a maximum Hg 2 + concentration (1 g l − 1). On the other hand, for the acid form (PFHA, LHA), the intense band of ν c=o (—COOH) disappeared proportionally to the increase of Hg 2 + concentration and the ν as (—COO −) band moved for about 20 cm − 1. The same results were reached with pH variations. Our results were confirmed by ICP-AES mercury analysis. This study shows that humic acids react differently according to their chemical and structural state...|$|R

The various sets of isomers studied showed considerable and interesting differences. Most sublimed well before melting, generally with an increasing rate of mass loss beyond their very different melting points. The existence of ranges of isomers allows for the comparison of their behaviour, including such aspects as melting, vaporisation, and the influence of products on the course of decomposition of initially-solid reactants. The differences in behaviour of 4 -ASA and 5 -ASA were the most remarkable, with 5 -ASA being far more stable and apparently not decarboxylating readily, while 4 -ASA sublimed at temperatures below the melting point, becoming less stable and decarboxylating in the liquid form. There is also a marked difference in the thermal behaviour of 3 -ASA, as compared with 4 -ASA and 5 -ASA. It decarboxylated at higher temperatures (260 °C) than 4 -ASA (150 °C). The addition of the possible decomposition products to these compounds showed faster decomposition for 4 -ASA mixed with 3 -AP. The sodium salts of 3 -ASA and 4 -ASA decarboxylate while that of 5 -ASA did not. Binary mixtures of the substances listed above with beta-cyclodextrin (BCD), hydroxypropylbeta-cyclodextrin (HPBCD) and gamma-cyclodextrin (GCD) were prepared (by simple physical mixing or by kneading with a solvent) and were then examined for possible interactions using DSC, TG-FTIR, HSM, XRD and NMR. Generally, kneaded mixtures showed greater changes in thermal behaviour from that of the individual components than the physical mixtures, but changes in the physical mixtures were also significant. Comparison {{of the effects of the}} different CDs on the thermal behaviour of individual ASA isomers showed that HPBCD has the greatest interaction with 3 -ASA and 5 -ASA, followed by GCD, while BCD generally showed the least interactions. For 4 -ASA, the effect of GCD is more marked than for 3 -ASA and 5 -ASA. GCD has the largest molecular cavity. ...|$|R
