A blast room includes {{three of the four}} components of a blast cabinet: the containment structure, the abrasive blasting system and the dust collector. Most blast rooms have recycling systems ranging from manual sweeping and shoveling the abrasive back into the <b>blast</b> <b>pot</b> to full reclaim floors that convey the abrasive pneumatically or mechanically to a device that cleans the abrasive prior to recycling.|$|E
5000|$|Mobile dry {{abrasive}} blast {{systems are}} typically {{powered by a}} diesel air compressor. The air compressor provides a large volume of high pressure air to a single or multiple [...] "blast pots". <b>Blast</b> <b>pots</b> are pressurized, tank-like containers, filled with abrasive material, used to allow an adjustable amount of blasting grit into the main blasting line. The number of <b>blast</b> <b>pots</b> is dictated by the volume of air the compressor can provide. Fully equipped blast systems are often found mounted on semi-tractor trailers, offering high mobility and easy transport from site to site. Others are hopper-fed types making them lightweight and more mobile.|$|R
