The third set was undertaking gauge changing trials at Shin-Yatsushiro Station (on Kyushu), commencing in 2014 for a proposed three-year period, however testing was suspended in December 2014 after accumulating approximating 33,000km, following the discovery of defective thrust <b>bearing</b> <b>oil</b> <b>seals</b> on the bogies. The train was being trialled between Kumamoto, travelling on the narrow gauge line to Shin-Yatsushiro, where a gauge changer has been installed, so the GCT could then be trialled on the Shinkansen line to Kagoshima. It was anticipated the train would travel approximately 600,000km over the three-year trial.|$|R

40|$|LecturePg. 81 - 90 The design, integration, and {{implementation}} of a successful project to retrofit a high speed, eight stage centrifugal compressor with magnetic bearings and gas face seals is presented. The application is removal of light gases {{from the top of}} a fractionating tower in a refinery coker unit. The justification and reasons for the selection of the coker compressor retrofitted with magnetic bearings are discussed. The technical aspects of design, rotordynamics and operation of the old <b>oil</b> <b>bearing</b> and <b>seal</b> design to the retrofitted magnetic bearing and gas face seal designs are compared. The tuning of the magnetic bearings is also discussed along with startup and operation of the compressor running on magnetic bearings. The significant challenge associated with retrofitting a compressor with magnetic bearings previously running on <b>oil</b> <b>bearings</b> is addressed from a design consideration and rotordynamics point of view. The development of assembly/disassembly techniques and manufacturing methods special to a magnetic bearing retrofit are described.

30|$|In a servo cylinder, the radial {{component}} of a partial load on the piston rod causes {{the front end of}} the piston rod to deflect downward relative to the center of mass. This breaks the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> between the support oil pad and counter oil pad, and changes the piston rod gap, which affects the pressure in the oil chamber of each oil pad. When the radial force increases, based on the centroid location, the gap between the <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> edges of the piston rod <b>bearing</b> <b>oil</b> cushion and counter oil cushion decreases with increasing deflection of the piston rod. Because the system has a constant-pressure oil supply, under the joint action of hole damping and <b>oil</b> edge <b>sealing,</b> the <b>oil</b> chamber experiences a pressing force. This causes the oil pressure in the upper and lower oil pads of the piston rod to increase, resulting in a larger reaction force. This increased force counteracts the radial force of the eccentric load to balance the partial load. As the movement of the piston rod changes during operation, the radial force generated by the eccentric load also changes dynamically. The gap between the piston rod and <b>oil</b> <b>seal</b> changes correspondingly under the effects of fluid-solid coupling. The pressure in the oil chambers in the upper and lower oil pads then makes the necessary adjustments so the piston rod can be adaptively aligned in the guide sleeve.|$|R
