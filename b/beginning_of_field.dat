40|$|The {{appearance}} {{of a team of}} interviewers among the population of a small community, uncustomed to surveys, may influence the behaviour of respondents. It is probable that rumours about the contents and purpose of interviewing will be circulated reflecting the community’s expectations and anxieties. Depending on the subject matter of such rumours and the speed with which they are disseminated a bias may appear in the answers of a considerable number of respondents in the sample. To control the rumours about interviewing special arrangements were made in a survey conducted in a small town: 1. several disguised “reconnaissance interviews” were made at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> work to check whether the population took note of previous pilot interviewing, 2. permanent contacts were sustained with a group of local informants during the whole period of field work, 3. {{at the end of each}} interview each respondent was asked informally if he had had any contact with anybody already interviewed and what that person had told him about interviewing. Using the materials so collected it was found out that: 1. after 11 days of interviewing 42 % in the sample had some contact with the rumours, younger persons and those with higher educational attainment having been more susceptible to such a contact, 2. no dominant theme appeared in the rumours; most often (33 °/o) they did not contain any specific knowledge about the purpose of interviewing, in spite of interviewers’ informing their respondents that “it was aimed at preparing a study about the living conditions in the community”; the latter theme appeared only very rarely (15 °/o), 3. except one question concerning future changes in the community’s living conditions, no statistically significant differences appeared between answers to three chosen questions, given by those who did and did not have any contact with the rumours...|$|E
40|$|The article {{studies the}} festivities and {{holidays}} of the Estonian folk calendar, and {{their position in}} the yearly cycle. The author makes an attempt to indicate that the position of feast days and holidays in the calendar is not random, but follow a specific and clearly perceptible system. The system and, particularly, the specific dates of the holidays are based on an astronomical-mathematical construction rather than the climate and/or agricultural activities, which has been generally believed so far. This explains why the calendar holidays of several European countries coincide, regardless of the differences in life style and tradition. A closer look is taken on four Estonian folk calendar holidays, which date back to the period before Christianity: taliharjapäev (Jan. 14, the day when the backbone of winter is broken), künnipäev (April 14, the day marking the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> activities), karusepäev (July 13) and kolletamispäev (Oct. 14, marking the end of field activities). These days fit in the calendar system which divides a year in sixteen parts, which have been associated with prehistoric, astronomically oriented megalithic constructions in Europe. This calendar system may have been known in Estonia, suggesting that similar astronomically positioned constructions could exist here; though, as far as it is known, archaeologists have not discovered any thus far. The article also discusses the role of folk calendar holidays in today's society. The fact that the Estonian folk calendar largely originates from the period of agrarian society explains why former traditions have lost their significance in modern urbanised life. However, since the article argues that many folk calendar holidays are based on specific astronomical phenomena rather than the cycle of agrarian activities, these holidays may not have lost their meaning and role in a modern, considerably transformed cultural environment...|$|E

40|$|Formation {{damage has}} been {{observed}} {{to be one of}} the severe problems during field life operation. In the waterflood projects, proper design water injection at the <b>beginning</b> <b>of</b> <b>field</b> life is crucial to minimize effects of incompatibility between source water/formation water. If the incompatibility condition is created then the scale precipitation might occur. In many oil/gas field cases, detrimental loss production or even well abandonment are required. The supersaturation condition is one of the critical factors that cause formation. If the condition is reached, insoluble salts will precipitate through nucleation and crystal growth process [1]. In this thesis, literature studies are conducted to gain deeper understanding about the scales behaviors, types and how to inhibit and remove them. In addition, PHREEQC simulator is run to study incompatibility waters (FW/Injected water) with variation of temperature, pressure, mixing ratio and injected water salinity. Temperature is set from 25 OC to 150 OC. Pressure is run at 10 atm, 50 atm, and 100 atm. The mixing ratios vary at 30 %, 50 %, and 70 % of sea water. The injected water is sea water (SW), diluted 10 times SW and 50 times diluted SW. In addition, the effects of heterogeneity reservoir are studied to see the influences to scale formation. Subsequently, a study of scale prevention and removal are also performed to reduce impact on scale precipitation The study shows that the scale potential is mainly dominated by Sulfate Scales (CaSO 4, BaSO 4, SrSO 4) and Carbonate Scales (CaCO 3, MgCa(CO 3) 2). The solubility of BaSO 4 scale increases with temperature and vice versa. It is observed that CaSO 4 (s) is extremely precipitated at high temperature followed by carbonate scales dissolution. Pressure drops from 100 atm to 10 atm creates insoluble salt precipitation, extremely found for carbonate scales with twice of solubility decreasing. The increase in mixing ratios leads to more scale precipitation, observed in an increase from 50 %SW to 70 %SW yields a triple reduction of MgCa(CO 3) 2 solubility. Injected water salinity reveals the significant impact on potential scale precipitation. Lower potential scales were observed in the mixing of FW/diluted SW than FW/SW. Most of the scales can be dissolved into solution, except BaSO 4 which is still precipitated out even in the mixing FW/diluted 50 times SW. Lastly, the heterogeneity of the reservoir influences the development of mixing incompatible waters in the reservoir where higher degree of heterogeneity will result in more scale precipitation. By doing this study, it can be inferred that the less scale potential occurs by lowering salinity of injected water. It is related to the Low Salinity water injection that has been established recently, it offers not only the significant oil enhancement but also lower scaling potential than High Salinity water injection...|$|E
