40|$|Suitability of electrospinning for <b>biodrug</b> {{formulation}} {{was investigated}} {{in order to develop}} an electrospinning-based method for producing oral dosage form of beta-galactosidase. beta-Galactosidase-loaded polymeric (polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylpyrrolidones with two different molar masses, and polyethylene glycol) nanofibers were prepared by electrospinning in order to lengthen the shelf life of the enzyme (providing an alternative technology to drying). Based on the activity of the encapsulated beta-galactosidase, the most suitable polymer was polyvinylpyrrolidone with higher molecular weight (1, 200, 000 Da), because 97 % of the original activity remained in this case. Kinetic behavior of beta-galactosidase did not show any alteration after encapsulation, and the pH and temperature profiles were not changed either. Time course of viability testing showed that the nanofibrous formulation can provide long-term stability for beta-galactosidase; the activity of the enzyme decreased only 4 % after a year. Furthermore, scaling-up and tableting had no influence on activity and long-term stability; thus, the developed drying technology and tablets, containing enzyme-loaded nanofibers, can provide a new promising way of oral <b>biodrug</b> delivery.

40|$|MastersIn {{the light}} of modern {{therapeutic}} treatment, <b>biodrugs</b> are becoming the cornerstone in treatment of many diseases. This {{stems from the fact}} that a classical drug (chemical drugs) treats the symptom of the disease, while <b>biodrugs</b> interfere with the pathway of the disease. The pharmaceutical industry faces the challenges of supplying high amounts of high quality <b>biodrugs,</b> higher production efficiencies will consequently, lower the costs of the final product (Ronald, 2008). A variety of strategies are being use to optimize the production yield by using recombinant protein production systems, such as Escherichia coli (E. coli) and yeast Saccharomyces cervisiae (S. cervisiae) and Pichia pastoris (P. pastoris) (Schmidt, 2004). Such strategies can be applied early in the development phase and involve the use of genetic engineering and molecular biology techniques, as well as in latter development stages that involve approaches such as high cell density (HCD) cultivation, optimization of the culture environment, fermentation process engineering and downstream processing phase. Interferon gamma (IFNγ) is one of these drugs. It is used to treat cancer and immunological disorders. In this work our main objective was to generate yeast and E. coli clones that produced recombinant human IFNγ (rhIFNγ). We used a genetic engineering approach to develop a P. pastoris clone that expresses a rhIFNγ from a wild type cDNA. Similarly we have developed a P. pastoris clone that expresses a rhIFNγ from a synthetic cDNA whose sequence was optimized according to the yeast codon-usage bias. Followed by the analytical production and purification of rhIFNγ from the two clones and controlled the recombinant protein on SDS-PAGE. Followed by identification by Western blot technique. Finally we compared the rhIFNγ production yield of the two clones. We have also expressed rhIFNγ wild type cDNA in the E. coli origami strain as a soluble Glutathione S-transferase (GST) fusion protein. The expression was induced by Isopropyl-β-D. thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the recombinant protein was controlled by SDS-PAGE and Western blot.

It {{is the most common}} disabling rheumatic pathology in adults older than 45 years, and there is no specific treatment. Objectives: Based on the rationale that in vitro polymerized-type I collagen induces chondrocytes proliferation, up-regulates the cartilage extracellular matrix proteins and down-regulates proinflammatory cytokines, we decided to evaluate its effect on cartilage repair in a rat model of OA. Methods: Thirty Wistar male rats with partial meniscectomy were subjected to daily high impact exercise during 3 weeks. Rats were randomly allocated into 5 groups a) training control, b) sham/operated control, c) toxicity control, d) OA treated with 4 intraarticular (IA) injections of placebo, and e) OA treated with 4 IA injections of polymerized-type I collagen. Weight, temperature and thickness of the knee were measured. Histological and radiological analysis was also performed. Type I and II collagen as well as, MMP 13 expression was determined by immunofluorescence. Results: Clinimorphometric analysis showed a higher temperature and thickness of the knee in OA/placebo vs. OA/polymerized-type I collagen treated rats. Radiological and histological analysis demonstrated that polymerized-type I collagen but not placebo preserved joint cavity structure and proteoglycans content and induced an increase of 2 to 4 fold type II collagenexpressing chondrocytes whereas it inhibited type I collagen and MMP 13 producing chondrocytes.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Adalimumab is a fully human {{monoclonal}} antibody to tumor necrosis factor (TNF), which was recently introduced as a therapy for Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis. Besides neutralization, induction of apoptosis of monocytes/macrophages and T cells {{is thought to}} be an important mechanism of action of the anti-tumor necrosis factor {{monoclonal antibody}} infliximab, at least in Crohn's disease therapy. AIM: To study caspase activation and the induction of apoptosis by adalimumab and the effect of a caspase inhibitor in vivo. METHODS: For in vitro studies, THP- 1 cells (human monocytic cell line) were incubated with adalimumab, infliximab, or human immunoglobulin G, and annexin V + propidium iodide, Apo 2. 7, and 7 -amino actinomycin-D were used to study apoptosis on the cell membrane, mitochodrial, and DNA level, respectively. Active caspase- 3 was detected by intracellular staining. For in vivo studies, a chimeric human-mouse model was used, in which THP- 1 cells were injected intraperitoneally in SCID-Beige mice followed by treatment with adalimumab, infliximab, or human immunoglobulin G. Effects of a pan-caspase inhibitor N-benzyloxycarbonyl-Val-Ala-Asp-fluoromethyketone on apoptosis induction were evaluated. RESULTS: In vitro analysis revealed that apoptosis could be induced in THP- 1 cells by both adalimumab and infliximab. Activation of caspase- 3 after incubation with adalimumab was demonstrated by intracellular staining. In addition, in the chimeric mouse model, a higher percentage of residual THP- 1 cells were apoptotic, and lower cell numbers were recovered in the adalimumab- or infliximab-treated mouse. Apoptosis induction by adalimumab could be abrogated through in vivo pretreatment of mice with the pan-caspase inhibitor. CONCLUSIONS: Adalimumab, besides neutralizing tumor necrosis factor, also induces apoptosis of transmembrane tumor necrosis factor-positive THP- 1 cells by activating intracellular caspases.

40|$|This is {{the first}} ever attempt to combine {{anti-cancer}} therapeutic effects of emerging anticancer <b>biodrug</b> bovine lactoferrin (bLf), and multimodal imaging efficacy of Fe 3 O 4 nanoparticles (NPs) together, as a saturated Fe 3 O 4 -bLf. For cancer stem cell specific uptake of nanocapsules/nanocarriers (NCs), Fe 3 O 4 -bLf was encapsulated in alginate enclosed chitosan coated calcium phosphate (AEC-CP) NCs targeted (Tar) with locked nucleic acid (LNA) modified aptamers against epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) and nucleolin markers. The nanoformulation was fed orally to mice injected with triple positive (EpCAM, CD 133, CD 44) sorted colon cancer stem cells in the xenograft cancer stem cell mice model. The complete regression of tumor was observed in 70 % of mice fed on non-targeted (NT) NCs, with 30 % mice showing tumor recurrence after 30 days, while only 10 % mice fed with Tar NCs showed tumor recurrence indicating a significantly higher survival rate. From tumor tissue analyses of 35 apoptotic markers, 55 angiogenesis markers, 40 cytokines, 15 stem cell markers and gene expression studies of important signaling molecules, {{it was revealed that}} the anti-cancer mechanism of Fe 3 O 4 -bLf was intervened through TRAIL, Fas, Fas-associated protein with death domain (FADD) mediated phosphorylation of p 53, to induce activation of second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (SMAC) /DIABLO (inhibiting survivin) and mitochondrial depolarization leading to release of cytochrome C. Induction of apoptosis was observed by inhibition of the Akt pathway and activation of cytokines released from monocytes/macrophages and dendritic cells (interleukin (IL) 27, keratinocyte chemoattractant (KC)). On the other hand, the recurrence of tumor in AEC-CP-Fe 3 O 4 -bLf NCs fed mice mainly occurred due to activation of alternative pathways such as mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) /extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and Wnt signaling leading to an increase in expression of survivin, survivin splice variant (survivin 2 B) and other anti-apoptotic proteins Bad, Bcl- 2 and XIAP. Apart from the promising anti-cancer efficacy and the exceptional tumor targeting ability observed by multimodal imaging using near-infrared (NIR) imaging, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computerized tomographic (CT) techniques, these NCs also maintained the immunomodulatory benefits of bLf as they were able to increase the RBC, hemoglobin, iron calcium and zinc levels in mice...|$|E

Phase IV is characterised by infiltration of polymorphonuclear cells, and a self-limiting regulatory process called apoptosis is observed (phase V). If the inflammatory process persists, late chronic inflammation takes place (phase VI). In some pathological conditions, such as organ-specific autoimmune diseases, chronic inflammation is present early in the disease.

40|$|This thesis investigates epigenetics {{in cancer}} with {{particular}} emphasis on breast cancer. There are two major themes, see Figure above. The first theme relates to the potential for assessing and developing more efficient epigenetic drugs while the second theme investigates mechanism of downregulation of ANKRD 11, a putative tumour suppressor gene, in human breast cancer. This thesis is in the publication format with Chapters 1 and 3 as published articles, Chapter 2 submitted for publication and Chapter 4 as a manuscript in preparation. Theme 1 : To improve the epigenetic-based therapeutic approach (Chapter 1 and 2) One of the roles that epigenetics plays in cancer development is the inhibition of transcription of tumour suppressor genes. Chapter 1, published as a review in <b>Biodrugs,</b> examines the knowledge of currently available therapeutic approaches related to epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation for cancer treatment. Drug-related issues that could influence the application of therapeutics for clinical use are reviewed and possible developments to improve the clinical use of the drugs explored. Epigenetic-based drugs are emerging as anti-cancer therapies in the clinic. Existing demethylating agents have poor pharmacological properties that limit their clinical use, {{and the application of}} nano-based encapsulation to resolve these issues is discussed. Chapter 2, submitted as an original research article to <b>Biodrugs,</b> presents the development and assessment of an assay to allow comparison of epigenetic-related drugs in a high throughput format. Decitabine is encapsulated in a liposomal formulation and the potency of this newly formulated decitabine and existing drugs are effectively compared using the developed assay system. Further development and validation of the assay system and the liposomal formulated decitabine, not included in the submitted manuscript are included as supplementary data. Theme 2 : Investigation of gene silencing mechanism of tumour suppressor ANKRD 11 (Chapter 3 and 4) ANKRD 11 is novel gene that was previously characterised in our laboratory, and found to be a putative tumour suppressor gene and a p 53 -coactivator (Neilsen et al. 2008). Chapter 3, published in European Journal of Cancer, investigates the mechanism of downregulation of ANKRD 11 in human breast cancer. This chapter identifies the promoter sequence of ANKRD 11, demonstrates the critical region of the ANKRD 11 promoter subjected to DNA methylation, and associates the DNA methylation levels of ANKRD 11 with its gene expression and clinical data. Further analysis of the DNA methylation pattern of this gene revealed a putative GLI 1 transcription-factor binding site within the localised region of the promoter that is methylated. Chapter 4, presented as a manuscript in preparation, further explores the relationship between ANKRD 11 and GLI 1 in breast cancer. GLI 1 is a Hedgehog signalling transcription factor, which {{has been shown to be}} involved in breast cancer development. This study analyses the transcriptional activity of ANKRD 11 in the cells overexpressed with GLI 1 and quantifies differential expression of these two genes in different stages of breast cancer. Future experiments to confirm and extend these exciting preliminary findings are discussed. The final chapter of this thesis summarises the findings of these studies and possible future research directions. The impact of these findings for the development of anti-cancer drugs, and the possible role of expression of ANKRD 11 and GLI 1 in breast cancer are highlighted. Thesis (Ph. D.)

Extracorporeal Therapeutic Techniques Unit - Immunohematology and Transfusion Medicine, University of Rome 'La Sapienza', ROME, ItalyIntroduction: The {{prognosis}} {{of patients}} with severe systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) who have glomerulonephritis is poor, despite treatment with immunosuppressive therapy. Indications for the use of apheresis technologies in managing SLE have undergone numerous remodelling since the first attempt of treatment in 1974. Once thought to be a promising treatment for SLE, apheresis has been limited as an adjunct in managing the disorder. Immunoadsorption Apheresis (IA) has been only recently used to a wider extent in complicated autoimmune diseases. Aim: Randomized, controlled data related to the treatment of autoimmune diseases with IA and immunosuppressive therapy, are still scarce. To assess effectiveness and safety IA was given in combination with immunosuppressive drugs to five patients with severe complicated SLE in a pivotal open label study. Patients and Methods: Five patients with severe SLE and nephritis, who had not responded to conventional therapy, were submitted to IA (Selesorb®, Kaneka MA- 03 System, Osaka-Japan) and subsequent pulse cyclophosphamide. Results:Patient M/F Age Complication IA sessions Remission 1 F 44 VasculitisNephritis 18 YesNo 2 F 26 Nephritis 12 Yes 3 M 28 Nephritis 12 Yes 4 F 35 Nephritis 15 Yes 5 F 49 Nephritis 17 YesIA in combination with immunosuppressive drugs showed to be effective in 4 patients and of limited efficacy in 1 individual, as reported above. Conclusion: Further investigations, {{increase in the number of}} subjects to be studied, a multicenter study approach, and a long-term follow-up are necessary to confirm the advantages of IA. It is to be underlined that adverse events are very rare and advances in apheresis technologies, like immunoadsorption, might, in the future, play a role in the therapeutic approach for severe SLE.

40|$|The HER 2 gene {{amplification}} occurs in 20 - 30 % {{of breast cancer}} and is correlated with a poorer prognosis compared to HER 2 -negative disease due to increased proliferation and metastatic potential. Two major types of receptor inhibitors {{have been developed for}} therapy and one for each categories is currently used in clinic: i) the humanized monoclonal antibody trastuzumab, directed against the HER 2 extracellular domain; and ii) the EGFR/HER 2 dual tyrosine kinase inhibitor lapatinib. However, patients may develop resistance to drugs and show disease progression. Several resistant mechanisms have been explored and are still under investigation. Here, we focus our attention on the role played by the alternative splicing forms of HER 2 in mediating HER 2 oncogenic activity and in conditioning the response to HER 2 therapies. Three HER 2 splice variants have been described so far; the p 100 and the herstatin gave raised to two secreted proteins of 100 kd and 68 kd, respectively that act as cell growth inhibitors. Herstatin has been described for its ability to interrupt the constitutive HER 2 activation, but also for its capacity to hamper HER 2 dimerization with the others HER receptors. Interestingly, herstatin, present as mRNA and protein in non cancerous tissue in areas adjacent to breast carcinoma, is absent as protein in 75 % of mammary tumors, which indicates that cancer cells are protected by some intrinsic mechanism against the putative growth-inhibitory effects of this naturally occurring molecule. The third splice form of HER 2 gene is the Δ 16 HER 2, encoding for a receptor lacking exon 16, whose absence determines a constitutive active dimers with transforming activity in vitro and in vivo. The Δ 16 HER 2 binds to trastuzumab to a less extend, due to conformational changes of the extracellular domain. The Δ 16 HER 2 accounts for almost 9 % of the total HER 2 transcripts in human breast cancers and, additionally, Δ 16 HER 2 levels are supposed to increase proportionally at the increasing of the HER 2 wild-type copy numbers in human primary breast cancers. The availability of a specific assay to determine and quantify the expression levels of this splicing form and the availability of Δ 16 HER 2 transgenic mice models made this variant as the most promising for the development of <b>biodrugs.</b> Finally, HER 2 carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs), generated by alternative initiation of translation, were observed in breast cancer patients. In particular, 611 -CTF was described to activate multiple signaling pathways since it is expressed as a constitutively active homodimer. Expression of 611 -CTF led to development of aggressive and invasive mammary tumors and it was suggested to be a potent oncogene capable of promoting mammary tumor progression and metastasis. </span...|$|R

Are there any relations between RA disease and HCV infection?HCV-related ArthritisRheumatologic complications of HCV infection are common and include mixedcryoglobulinemia, vasculitis, Sjogren’s syndrome, arthritis and fibromyalgia(1, 2). There is a welldefined picture of arthritis associated with the presence of mixed cryoglobulinemia that consists of an intermittent mono or oligoarticular,nondestructive arthritis affecting large and mediumsize joints(1). 2 % to 20 % of HCV-infected patients experience arthritis and as 50 % experience arthralgia(3) Clinical ManifestationsHCV-related arthritis (HCVra) commonly presents as rheumatoid-like, symmetrical inflammatory polyarthritis involving mainly small joints or less commonly as mono- or oligoarthritis of large joints. The joints involved in HCV-related arthritis are similar to RA(4). In about two thirds of the affected individuals, morning stiffness may be severe, resolving after more than an hour(5). Clinical picture of arthritis associated with the presence of mixed cryoglobulinemia in patients with HCV infection consists of an intermittent, mono or oligoarticular, nondestructive arthritis affecting large and medium size joints(1). What Are Differences Between True RA Disease and HCV-related Arthritis?Differentiation between true RA and HCVrelated arthritis may be difficult. HCV-related arthritis usually runs a relatively benign course that, in contrast to true RA, is typically nondeforming and is not associated with articular bony erosions(4). Furthermore, unlike classic RA, ESR is elevated only in about half of the patients and subcutaneous nodules are absent(5). Patients with HCV-related arthritis are seropositive for RF, but anti keratin antibodies (AKA) are a useful marker to differentiate patients with RA from these with HCV-related arthritis(6). In a study AKA were detected in 69 % of patients with RA compared to only 8 % with HCV associated arthritis(6). Positive HCV antibody and HCV RNA, and the absence of bony erosions, subcutaneous nodules may be useful in distinguishing between HCV-related arthritis and RA.

Such possible, but yet not proven, mechanisms include direct invasion of synovial cells by the virus, eliciting local inflammatory response, cytokineinduced disease or immune complex disease, particularly in genetically susceptible individuals(5). HLA-DR 4 histocompatibility antigen is elevated significantly in HCV-infected patients with autoimmune diseases, including RA. In theory, patients who are genetically predisposed to autoimmunity develop polyarthritis consistent with a rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis(3). Which Patients with Polyarthritis Should Be Tested for HCV Infection?Risk factors for HCV infection such as transfusion and IV drug abuse or a history of hepatitis {{should be included in the}} history of present illness of any patient with polyarthritis(7). In such patients serologic studies for hepatitis C should be performed(7). Some authors recommend that any patient presenting with new onset of polyarthritis should be tested for HCV(3). Furthermore, it is recommended to test for HCV infection in patients with Sjogren's syndrome and fibromyalgia(4, 5). What Is the Best Treatment for HCV-related Arthritis?The optimal treatment for HCV-related arthritis has not yet been established and a few data about HCVra treatment are reported in the literature(5). Hydroxychloroquine, low doses of corticosteroids and NSAIDs are frequently administered to patients with HCV-related arthritis, but some authors describe an incomplete relief of symptoms, especially in the rheumatoid-like subset(9). Intake of low doses of corticosteroids and NSAIDs is more effective in subjects belonging to the monooligoarthritis group(9). On the other hand, Kessel et al. emphasized that HCV-related arthritis treated with steroids or cytotoxic agents can exacerbate HCV infection, and methotrexate or hepatotoxic drugs may negatively affect liver function(7). Once the diagnosis of HCVra is made, combination therapy with interferon alpha and ribavirin should be initiated. Use of antiviral drugs shows good results, but interferon alpha can worsen autoimmune disorders(9, 5). Low dose oral corticosteroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, hydroxychloroquine or sulfasalazine in addition to the antiviral therapy can be used to control arthritis-related symptoms(5). Anti TNFtherapy for RA in the setting of HCV appears to be safe and well tolerated without apparent influence on the underlying HCV infection; however, the usually non aggressive course of HCV-related arthritis does not justify their use as a current therapy(10, 11). Recommendations 1 - It may be recommended to test for HCV in any patient presenting with polyarthritis especially that high risk for HCV infection. 2 - It may be suggested that combination of antiviral treatment with interferon alpha plus ribavirin should be initiated as a part of the therapeutic regimen in HCV-related arthritis. Low dose corticosteroids, NSAIDs or hydroxychloroquine can be added to antiviral drugs. Options in FutureFurther research should be directed toward a better understanding of the pathogenesis of HCV-related arthritis. Also, additional research is needed to determine the optimal treatment of HCV-related arthritis and safety of IFN and anti-tumor agents in these patients. References 1. Buskila D.
