5|$|A {{binary search}} tree is a binary tree data {{structure}} that works <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of binary search. The records of the tree are arranged in sorted order, and each record in the tree can be searched using an algorithm similar to binary search, taking on average logarithmic time. Insertion and deletion also require on average logarithmic time in {{binary search tree}}s. This can faster than the linear time insertion and deletion of sorted arrays, and binary trees retain the ability to perform all the operations possible on a sorted array, including range and approximate queries.|$|E

5|$|Malaysia's {{foreign policy}} is officially <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of {{neutrality}} and maintaining peaceful relations with all countries, regardless of their political system. The government attaches a high priority to the security and stability of Southeast Asia, and seeks to further develop relations with {{other countries in the}} region. Historically the government has tried to portray Malaysia as a progressive Islamic nation while strengthening relations with other Islamic states. A strong tenet of Malaysia's policy is national sovereignty and the right of a country to control its domestic affairs.|$|E
5|$|Razer was {{designed}} and built by Ian Lewis and Simon Scott who, after watching the first series of Robot Wars, agreed that combat robots had potential to be considerably more destructive than the pioneering machines on display. Their choice of weapon was a piercing arm attached to a hydraulic ram and powered by a pump, itself powered by a motorcycle starter motor. This was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of the brake press, a piece of industrial machinery used to bend metal through progressive force.|$|E
5|$|Some {{algorithms}} become simpler {{when used}} on DAGs instead of general graphs, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of topological ordering. For example, {{it is possible}} to find shortest paths and longest paths from a given starting vertex in DAGs in linear time by processing the vertices in a topological order, and calculating the path length for each vertex to be the minimum or maximum length obtained via any of its incoming edges. In contrast, for arbitrary graphs the shortest path may require slower algorithms such as Dijkstra's algorithm or the Bellman–Ford algorithm, and longest paths in arbitrary graphs are NP-hard to find.|$|E

5|$|Some tile {{types that}} retain the Holliday junction's native 60° angle have been demonstrated. One such array uses tiles {{containing}} four Holliday junctions in a parallelogram arrangement. This structure {{had the benefit}} of allowing the junction angle to be directly visualized via atomic force microscopy. Tiles of three Holliday junctions in a triangular fashion have been used to make periodic three-dimensional arrays for use in X-ray crystallography of biomolecules. These structures are named for their similarity to structural units <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of tensegrity, which utilizes members both in tension and compression.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{received}} worldwide attention, {{and it had}} immediate {{effects on}} navies around the world. The preeminent naval powers, Great Britain and France, halted further construction of wooden-hulled ships, and others followed suit. A new type of warship, monitor, was produced <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of the original. The use of {{a small number of}} very heavy guns, mounted so that they could fire in all directions was first demonstrated by Monitor but soon became standard in warships of all types. Shipbuilders also incorporated rams into the designs of warship hulls {{for the rest of the}} century.|$|E
5|$|Empiricist David Hume's {{requirement}} that claims about reality must be verified by evidence influenced the logical positivist movement, particularly the philosopher A. J. Ayer. The movement proposed that, for {{a statement to}} hold meaning, it must be possible to verify its truthfulness empirically– with evidence from the senses. Consequently, the logical positivists argued that religious language must be meaningless because the propositions it makes are impossible to verify. Austrian philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein has been regarded as a logical positivist by some academics because he distinguished between things that can and cannot be spoken about; others have argued {{that he could not}} have been a logical positivist because he emphasised the importance of mysticism. British philosopher Antony Flew proposed a similar challenge <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> that, in so far as assertions of religious belief cannot be empirically falsified, religious statements are rendered meaningless.|$|E

5|$|Political realism {{formed the}} basis of Kennan's work as a diplomat and {{historian}} and remains relevant to the debate over American foreign policy, which since the 19th century has been characterized by a shift from the Founding Fathers' realist school to the idealistic or Wilsonian school of international relations. According to the realist tradition, security is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> of a balance of power, whereas Wilsonianism (considered impractical by realists) relies on morality as the sole determining factor in statecraft. According to the Wilsonians the spread of democracy abroad as a foreign policy is important and morals are valid universally. During the Presidency of Bill Clinton, American diplomacy represented the Wilsonian school {{to such a degree that}} those in favor of the realism likened President Clinton's policies to social work. According to Kennan, whose concept of American diplomacy was based on the realist approach, such moralism without regard to the realities of power and the national interest is self-defeating and will result in the decrease of American power.|$|E
