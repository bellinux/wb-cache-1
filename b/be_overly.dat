5|$|As {{the world}} starts to globalize, it is {{accompanied}} by criticism of the current forms of globalization, which are feared to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> corporate-led. As corporations become larger and multinational, their influence and interests go further accordingly. Being able to influence and own most media companies, {{it is hard to}} be able to publicly debate the notions and ideals that corporations pursue. Some choices that corporations take to make profits can affect people all over the world. Sometimes fatally.|$|E
5|$|In May 1861, Britain and France {{declared}} the South to be belligerents by international law, and their ships {{were entitled to}} {{the same rights as}} U.S.-flagged vessels to remain 24 hours in neutral ports. Nevertheless, Seward was pleased that both nations would not meet with Confederate commissioners or recognize the South as a nation. Britain did not challenge the Union blockade of Confederate ports, and Seward wrote that if Britain continued to avoid interfering in the war, he would not <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> sensitive to what wording they used to describe their policies.|$|E
5|$|The Almost Nearly Perfect People: The Truth About the Nordic Miracle is a 2014 nonfiction book by the British {{journalist}} Michael Booth. In the book, Booth {{focuses on}} the five Nordic countries—Denmark, Iceland, Norway, Finland and Sweden—dedicating {{a section of the}} book to each one. He began writing the book after migrating from England to Denmark, based on his perceptions of the Nordic region before and after moving. He wanted to present an alternative perspective to the extremely positive depiction of the region in British media. The book received mixed reviews: some critics found it to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> critical with poor humour, others praised its tone and informativeness.|$|E

25|$|McCain campaigned against Proposition 200, a 2004 Arizona state {{initiative}} {{intended to}} prevent illegal immigrants from voting, receiving welfare benefits, and mandated state agencies to report illegals to the federal government. McCain argued Prop 200 would <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> expensive to execute, {{that it would be}} ineffectual, and that immigration regulation falls only under the purview of the federal government.|$|E
25|$|Regardless of the debate, the Grimms' {{stories have}} {{continued}} to be resilient and popular around the world, although a recent study in England appears to suggest that parents consider the stories to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> violent and inappropriate for young children, writes Libby Copeland for Slate. Nevertheless, children remain enamored with grim stories as the recent success of The Grimm Series by Adam Gidwitz and The Sisters Grimm by Michael Buckley illustrates.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, Louis Waldman {{published}} his first autobiography, Labor Lawyer, {{in which he}} laid out his defense of the positions he had taken in his political career. Among other things, Waldman became very critical of the New Deal, considering it to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> accommodating to the Communists and exhibiting certain authoritarian tendencies, somewhat echoing the critique of the old right. He was particularly alarmed by the integration of trade unions into the state apparatus that began to occur during World War II.|$|E

25|$|Opened {{with natural}} grass in 1967, {{the field was}} {{switched}} to AstroTurf and lights were added for its third season in 1969. After seven years, it was replaced with new AstroTurf in 1976. Sand-based OmniTurf was installed in 1984 and 1991, and infilled NeXturf in 2001. The NeXturf was found to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> slick when wet and lasted only one season, and was transferred to an intramural field. FieldTurf made its debut in Autzen in 2002, and was replaced in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} months of the occupation, new {{officials}} were appointed to several local and regional positions (e.g., mayors, governors, local councils). The officials were chosen from a select group of individuals (including ex-Ba'ath party officials) in an attempt to speed the return to normality and to avoid the election of people opposed to the American and British presence. Certain religious clerics and other officials were considered to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> radical or dangerous. On occasion the appointed officials were found to behave less than admirably. On 30 June 2003, the appointed mayor of Najaf was arrested on charges of corruption.|$|E
25|$|Other {{painters}} {{were critical}} of Ōkyo's style. They {{found it to}} <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> concerned with physical appearances, alleging {{that he was too}} beholden to the real world and produced undignified works. Nevertheless, his style proved popular with the public, and commissions came in to do Western-style landscapes, decorative screens, and nudes. He did life drawings and used them for material in his paintings. Ōkyo was probably the first Japanese artist to do life drawings from nude models. The subject was still considered pornographic in Japan. During his career he painted for wealthy merchants, the shogunate, even the emperor.|$|E

25|$|Light {{restriction}} in the evening, {{sometimes called}} darkness therapy or scototherapy, is another treatment strategy. Just as bright light upon awakening should advance one's sleep phase, bright {{light in the}} evening and night delays it (see the PRC). It is suspected that DSPD patients may <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> sensitive to evening light. Thus, one might be advised to keep lights and computer screens dim for the last hours before bedtime and even wear amber-colored (blue-blocking) goggles. The photopigment of the retinal photosensitive ganglion cells, melanopsin, is excited by light mainly in the blue portion of the visible spectrum (absorption peaks at ~480 nanometers).|$|E
25|$|Although {{the drum}} {{magazine}} provided significant firepower, in military service {{it was found}} to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> heavy and bulky, especially when slung on the shoulder while marching. The M1928A1 Thompson drum magazine was rather fragile, and cartridges tended to rattle inside it, producing unwanted noise. For these reasons, the 20-round and later 30-round box magazines soon proved most popular with military users of the M1928A1, and drum compatibility {{was not included in}} the design of the wartime M1 and M1A1 models. The Thompson was one of the earliest submachine guns to incorporate a double-column, double-feed box magazine design, which undoubtedly contributed to the gun's reputation for reliability. In addition, the gun performed better than most after exposure to rain, dirt, and mud.|$|E
25|$|Although {{macroscopic}} {{concepts are}} essential for understanding our world, much of fundamental physics {{has been devoted to}} the search for a `theory of everything', a set of equations that perfectly describe the behavior of all fundamental particles. The view that this is the goal of science rests in part on the rationale that such a theory would allow us to derive the behavior of all macroscopic concepts, at least in principle. The evidence we have presented suggests that this view may <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> optimistic. A `theory of everything' is one of many components necessary for complete understanding of the universe, but is not necessarily the only one. The development of macroscopic laws from first principles may involve more than just systematic logic, and could require conjectures suggested by experiments, simulations or insight.|$|E

25|$|Although mice {{are small}} animals and {{care must be}} taken to avoid injury, they are also {{surprisingly}} robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children as they may <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or very frightened. Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as mice are generally considered non-aggressive. They do have a greater likelihood of biting unfamiliar people, especially males who are wild and territorial.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Yang Yuqing, Yang Rushi, Yang Yuqing's brother Yang Han'gong (楊漢工), Zhang Yuanfu (張元夫), and Xiao Huan (蕭澣) were {{perceived}} by Emperor Wenzong to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> eager in their partisanship, {{and he began}} to dislike them. After he made Li Deyu chancellor in 833, Li Deyu used Emperor Wenzong's dislike for these officials to begin ejecting Niu Faction officials from the government. Li Zongmin responded by having Zheng Tan, who was then imperial scholar, removed from his post as imperial scholar—but Emperor Wenzong reacted by promoting Zheng to be the chief imperial censor without consulting Li Zongmin, which caused Li Zongmin to be angry and fearful. Soon thereafter, Li Zongmin himself was sent out to Shannan West Circuit (山南西道, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), to serve as its military governor.|$|E
25|$|The {{club was}} not keen on repeating the {{disaster}} of 1991–92, {{and in the}} next season Bayern spent the equivalent of €12 million on the new players—Thomas Helmer (€4M), Brazil's captain Jorginho (€2.8M) and Lothar Matthäus (€2M) topped the bill of a list that also included Mehmet Scholl. Calming the nerves of the thrifty President Dr. Fritz Scherer, an economics professor at the University of Munich, was the sale of Stefan Effenberg and Brian Laudrup for €8.5 million to Fiorentina. The rebuilt side came close to winning the title, but just missed out. Ribbeck's tactics, which were felt to <b>be</b> <b>overly</b> negative, were blamed for this, and when the following season looked to be going no differently, Beckenbauer dismissed Ribbeck and took control of the team himself. An immediate upturn in form saw Bayern take that year's title.|$|E
