40|$|Background:. The breast {{has always}} been {{perceived}} as the emblem of femininity. Desire of having an ideal breast form has been of interest for a long time. Methods:. This preliminary article is a retrospective analysis of 894 cases of breast augmentation with Diagon/Gel breast implants covered with a micropolyurethane foam (Microthane). The surgical technique employed is a modified dual plane, which enables us to use a new anatomical implant to move the glandular parenchyma into a higher position. Results:. The study extended from January 2010 to September 2015, during which no breast implant developed <b>Baker</b> grade <b>III</b> or IV capsular contracture (CC) {{and only a few}} adverse events occurred. Patients reported to be highly satisfied with the final outcome, which was very natural both in the form and movement. Conclusions:. The new concept of Diagon/Gel represents {{the next step in the}} evolutionary progress of breast implants and allows the surgeon to perform not only a breast augmentation but also parenchymal elevation, which otherwise would have required a mastopexy, and we have called it breast enhancement...|$|R

40|$|Background:. The {{latissimus dorsi}} (LD) flap remains {{a good option}} for {{immediate}} or delayed breast reconstruction. The main limitation of this flap is the small volume provided. To improve the reconstructed breast volume, the LD flap is usually combined with a breast implant. Recently, fat grafting to the LD flap was described to maximize flap volume and obtain a totally autologous breast reconstruction. We report our experience with hybrid breast reconstruction using both breast implants and fat-enriched latissimus dorsi (FELD) flaps. Methods:. Between 2013 and 2016, 74 patients underwent breast reconstruction with FELD flaps only or FELD flaps combined with a breast implant. The LD flap was harvested as previously described. Donor sites for fat harvesting were chosen according to each patient’s natural fat distribution. Fat was harvested, centrifuged, and injected into the LD flap. After fat grafting, breast sizers were employed to determine the final breast volume when the addition of an implant was indicated. Results:. Good cosmetic outcomes were achieved in all cases, with a mean follow-up of 2. 1 years. No patients had cancer reoccurrences. Four patients experienced a seroma of the LD donor site, 1 had a breast hematoma, and 1 developed <b>Baker</b> grade <b>III</b> capsular contracture. One year postoperatively, a clinically relevant area of fat necrosis was observed in 1 patient and was surgically treated. Additional fat grafting sessions were required in 3 cases. Conclusion:. In elected cases, a FELD flap alone or in combination with a small implant is a valuable technique for breast reconstruction surgery...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Capsular {{contracture}} {{remains the}} most common complication following breast augmentation surgery, and evidence suggests that bacterial biofilm on the implant surface is responsible. The authors investigated whether the interaction of bacterial biofilm with implants independently determines progression to capsule formation. They also studied the rate of bacterial growth and adhesion to implants. METHODS: Sixteen adult female pigs had 121 breast implants inserted. Sixty-six implants - 23 smooth and 43 textured - were inoculated with a human strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis and received no other treatment. After an average period of 19 weeks, Baker grading was performed and implants were retrieved. For the in vitro study, samples underwent both quantitative bacterial analysis and imaging using confocal laser scanning and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: At explantation, {{there was no significant}} difference (p = 1. 0) in the presence of capsular contracture (<b>Baker</b> grade <b>III</b> and IV) between smooth (83 percent) and textured implants (84 percent). Biofilm was confirmed on 60 of the 66 capsules. Capsules from smooth and textured implants had the same number of infecting bacteria (textured: 3. 01 x 10 ⁸ bacteria/g; smooth: 3. 00 x 10 ⁸ bacteria/g). In vitro, the surface of textured implants showed 11 -, 43 -, and 72 -fold more bacteria at 2, 6, and 24 hours, respectively, compared with smooth implants (p < 0. 001). These findings were confirmed by imaging analysis. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that textured implants develop a significantly higher load of bacterial biofilm in comparison with smooth implants. Furthermore, in vivo, once a threshold of biofilm forms on either smooth or textured implant surfaces, there seems to be an equal propensity to progress to capsular contracture. 10 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Covalently linked {{cell wall}} {{proteins}} (CWPs) of the dimorphic fungus Candida albicans are implicated in virulence. We have {{carried out a}} comprehensive proteomic analysis of the covalently linked CWPs in exponential-phase yeast cells. Proteins were liberated from sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) -extracted cell walls and analyzed using immunological and advanced protein sequencing (liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry [LC/MS/MS]) methods. HF-pyridine and NaOH were used to chemically release glycosylphosphatidylinositol-dependent proteins (GPI proteins) and mild alkali-sensitive proteins, respectively. In addition, to release both classes of CWPs simultaneously, cell walls were digested enzymatically with a recombinant β- 1, 3 -glucanase. Using LC/MS/MS, we identified 14 proteins, of which only 1 protein, Cht 2 p, has been previously identified in cell wall extracts by using protein sequencing methods. The 14 identified CWPs include 12 GPI proteins and 2 mild alkali-sensitive proteins. Nonsecretory proteins were absent in our cell wall preparations. The proteins identified included several functional categories: (i) five CWPs are predicted carbohydrate-active enzymes (Cht 2 p, Crh 11 p, Pga 4 p, Phr 1 p, and Scw 1 p); (ii) Als 1 p and Als 4 p {{are believed to be}} adhesion proteins. In addition, Pga 24 p shows similarity to the flocculins of <b>baker's</b> yeast. (<b>iii)</b> Sod 4 p/Pga 2 p is a putative superoxide dismutase and is possibly involved in counteracting host defense reactions. The precise roles of the other CWPs (Ecm 33. 3 p, Pir 1 p, Pga 29 p, Rbt 5 p, and Ssr 1 p) are unknown. These results indicate that a substantial number of the covalently linked CWPs of C. albicans are actively involved in cell wall remodeling and expansion and in host-pathogen interactions...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of tissue}} {{expanders}} and implants is the simplest option for breast reconstruction following mastectomy. In the 1980 s, Hilton Becker introduced a round, inflatable breast implant {{that could be}} used as a permanent implant. Since then, the original implant has been improved in both design and architecture. The new Becker device consists of an anatomical implant composed of 35 % cohesive silicone gel in the outer chamber and 65 % normal saline in the inner chamber. This multicenter study describes our experience with the new anatomical Becker implants in a large series of patients, in both immediate and delayed breast reconstruction. We reviewed the clinical records of 204 patients who underwent a breast reconstruction with an anatomical Becker-type implant in the sub-muscular position between November 2004 and December 2006. Data on the patients' characteristics, indications for reconstruction, operative technique, device size used, complications, and need for further operations were collected and analyzed. A total of 248 breast reconstructions were performed in 204 patients. One hundred forty-three patients (70 %) underwent an immediate reconstruction; in the remaining 61 cases (30 %), the breast reconstruction was performed later. The patients' age ranged from 26 to 66 years, with a median age of 47. 5 years. The implant was placed unilaterally in 160 women (78. 5 %) and bilaterally in the remaining 44 (21. 5 %). Complications occurred in 85 cases (34. 2 %), in both the immediate and delayed reconstruction groups, and were related to wound healing, bleeding, seroma, and problems with the inflatable expanders. Iatrogenic implant rupture was documented in one case (0. 4 %). Inflation was impossible in 7 cases (2. 8 %) as a result of valve obstruction (3 cases, 1. 2 %) and valve displacement (4 cases, 1. 6 %). Implant malposition was the most troublesome complication; indeed, 34 patients (13. 7 %) complained of device malposition. Capsular contracture was assessed in all the patients. Significant capsular contracture (<b>Baker</b> grade <b>III</b> and IV) was detected in 6 cases (2. 4 %) at the follow-up approximately 1 year after surgery. Breast reconstruction with permanent inflatable expanders is widely acknowledged as a useful technique for breast cancer patients undergoing simple or modified radical mastectomy. The use of this device eliminates the need to replace a temporary tissue expander with a breast implant, thus avoiding a second operation. Although we believe autologous tissues afford the best method of reconstruction in the majority of patients, the results of our study show that expander implant placement may yield a reasonable reconstruction...|$|R
