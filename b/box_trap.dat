60|$|So Jonas {{brought down}} the <b>box</b> <b>trap</b> that night. It was a long box, about {{as big as a}} cricket, with a tall, pointed back, which looked like a steeple; so Rollo called it the steeple trap. It was so made that if the {{squirrel}} should go in, and begin to nibble some corn, which they were going to put in there, it would make the cover come down and shut him in. They fixed the trap {{on the end of the}} log, and Jonas observed, as he sat on the log, that he could see the barn chamber window through a little opening among the trees. Of course he knew that from the barn chamber window he could see the trap, though it would be too far off to see it plain.|$|E

50|$|Recommendations {{released}} by the University of California, Davis suggest {{the use of a}} gopher probe to locate the main burrow. Then a shovel can be used to widen the opening to the main burrow and traps can be set at opposite directions within the burrow. A wide array of different traps can be used, including the choker-style <b>box</b> <b>trap</b> and the pincher trap. Baiting a trap is not always necessary, though it may afford quicker or better results. Lettuce and other vegetables can be used as the bait. It is best to cover the traps with canvas or dirt to conceal the light. If two days pass without success, it is advisable to move the traps. Toxic bait can also be used, but involves a different trap placement strategy.|$|E
50|$|The {{striped skunk}} {{is one of}} North America's most sought after furbearers, and was once the second most {{harvested}} after the muskrat. Its fur is intrinsically valuable, being durable and having rich luster, though this trait decreases with wear and exposure to sunlight. Skunk pelts are divided into four grades, with the most prized being the ones with a greater amount of black. These grades are further subdivided in value according to their locality, with the most valuable occurring in northern regions, where the fur is finer and darker. Skunks are notable for being easy to trap, even approaching traps they'd been previously caught in. Because skunks are difficult to kill without having them discharge their musk (and thus ruin their fur) they were typically dispatched with a paralyzing blow to the lower back or drowned if caught in a <b>box</b> <b>trap.</b>|$|E

The use of a drift fences along with a pit-fall or funnel <b>box</b> <b>trap</b> has yielded high success. The length of the fence is variable, but the longer the fence results in a higher success rate. The fence is set with traps in the middle and/or the ends. Snakes encounter the fence and are directed or lead to the trap. Care must be taken in providing enough cover so the species do not die of heat exhaustion. Identifying all the species in the trap is recommended so an accidental envenomation is avoided. Pit fall traps are small buckets that are placed in holes dug out next to the drift fence.|$|E

5000|$|Over {{the next}} several chapters, Sam {{continues}} to reminisce about {{how he came to}} be self-sufficient by living off the plants and animals he finds on his grandfather's abandoned farm. He finds a hollow tree and decides to make it his home. Remembering how Native Americans used fire to create dugout canoes, he uses fire to make the interior of the hollow tree bigger. One day, while Sam is chopping an ash tree to make a bed, an old woman named Mrs. Thomas Fiedler forces him to help her pick strawberries. Seeing a peregrine falcon hunting for its prey, Sam decides he wants a falcon as a hunting bird. Sam returns to town to get a haircut, and reads up on falconry at the local public library. He camps near a cliff for several days to learn the location of a peregrine falcon nest, and steals a chick from the nest while the mother bird attacks him. He names the bird Frightful, because of the difficult time he had getting the nestling. A short time later, Sam is forced to hide in the woods for two days. A forest ranger, spotting the smoke from Sam's cooking fire, came to investigate what he believed was a forest fire. The ranger lingers near Sam's home overnight, but leaves after believing that whoever started the fire must have left the place. Sam also relates to the reader his memories about his adventures in the fall. He makes a <b>box</b> <b>trap</b> to catch animals to eat, but ends up catching a weasel instead. Sam calls the weasel The Baron for the fearless way the animal moves about the hollowed-out treehouse. Realizing winter is coming, Sam wants to kill a deer so he can make a door for his home. He learns how to smoke meat to preserve it for winter, and how to tan hides. When a poacher illegally kills a deer, Sam hides the carcass from the hunter so he can use it for food, a door, and a new pair of clothes. Sam remembers how he tanned the hide using a hollow tree stump and various plants. He also avoids townspeople who wander near his home by hiding in the woods. Sam trains Frightful to hunt, and the bird proves very good at it. Sam prepares for winter by hunting frogs, pheasants, rabbits, and sparrows; preserving wild grains and tubers; smoking fish and meat; and preparing storage spaces by hollowing out the trunks of trees. Finding another poached deer, Sam makes himself deerskin clothing to replace his worn-out city clothes. Sam notices a raccoon digging for mussels in the creek, and he learns how to hunt for shellfish. Sam names the raccoon Jesse Coon James, because it looks like a bandit and reminds him of the legendary outlaw Jesse James. Shortly after befriending the raccoon, Sam hears sirens nearby. When he returns to his hollowed out tree home, he finds a man there. At first, Sam believes the man is a criminal, and nicknames him [...] "Bando" [...] (a shortened version of [...] "bandit"). But the man is a professor of English literature, and is merely lost. He is surprised to find Sam, and gives Sam the nickname [...] "Thoreau". Bando spends 10 days with Sam, building a raft to take them downstream to catch fish. He gives Sam 10 pounds of sugar and teaches him to make jam. He also shows Sam how to make a whistle out of a willow branch. Bando also tries to make clay pots. Bando departs, and they agree that Bando will come back at Christmas to visit with Sam.|$|E

40|$|Reports were scanned {{in black}} and white at a {{resolution}} of 600 dots per inch and were converted to text using Adobe Paper Capture Plug-in. This paper presents design specifications and operation for a newly designed <b>box</b> <b>trap.</b> Used for live-capture of feral pigs in a tropical rain forest in Hawai’i, this trap can be utilized in other habitats for trapping other large quadrupeds (e. g., bears and deer). Each assembled trap weighs 195 pounds and has six separable portable panels. Following an eight-step procedure, a trap can be constructed in eight man-hours. Features of the trap which are not found in other designs and considered unique are: (1) it is all metal; (2) it is equipped with a multi-catch door which forms part of a panel; (3) it uses sleeve-couplings instead of conventional-type hinges for door attachment; (4) it employs convenient use of panel clamps for locking panels together; (5) it allows a wide range of convertibility of an individual trap into group traps of any configuration.

40|$|Many {{different}} types of traps {{have been developed to}} increase feral swine (Sus scrofa) capture efficiency. Though not previously compared, gate styles may influence capture success. Our objectives were to report feral swine capture data from 31 trapping campaigns conducted in 17 counties from 2005 to 2011 in Texas, USA, compare capture rates by demographic category between side-swing and rooter gates, and evaluate influences of moisture, using the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI), on juvenile capture rates. We trapped feral swine during all months of the year. Our trap configurations were identical with the exception of gate style. Traps had either side-swing or rooter gates. We captured 1, 310 feral swine during 2, 424 trap-nights. We found no differences in capture rates between gate styles for adults, adult males, or adult females. However, we found juvenile capture rates and total capture rates to differ between gate styles. <b>Box</b> <b>traps</b> with rooter gates captured more juveniles, resulting in more total captures than in <b>box</b> <b>traps</b> with side-swing gates. Partitioned rooter gates are constructed to allow for continual entry after the gate has been tripped; whereas with single-panel side-swine gates, continual entry may be more challenging for juvenile animals that lack the size and strength to push through the spring tension. Rooter gates should be considered over side-swing gates in management programs aimed at overall damage reduction. However, in management or research programs that seek to capture adult feral swine, side-swing gates may be more appropriate because fewer non-target juvenile feral swine are captured...|$|R

Specifically, feral hogs have caused damage to vegetative plantings used in the reclamation process of surface lignite mines. In addition to vegetative losses, erosion control problems and water quality impacts have been noted. <b>Box</b> and corral <b>traps</b> were evaluated for their effectiveness in capturing feral hogs. Six male and 10 female hogs were radiomonitored from January 1998 - January 1999 at Big Brown Lignite Mine in Freestone County, Texas. Annual range size, habitat use, habitat selection, and diel movements of the feral hogs were determined using a geographic information system. Corral traps were more efficient than <b>box</b> <b>traps</b> in capturing feral hogs (P < 0. 000). Male feral hogs had a mean annual range of 15. 8 km[]. Female hogs had a significantly (P < 0. 02) smaller annual range of 6. 5 km[]. Hogs preferred reclaimed wildlife vegetation plantings and unmixed riparian corridors on the mine site. Screening cover and free water were important landscape features that influenced hog movements. Feral hogs moved greater distances from free water and screening cover deleing nighttime hours. In addition, seasonal effects of distance from these landscape features were significant. Feral hogs traveled greater distances from both gee water and screening during winter and spring, but during fall and summer months, they remained closer (P < 0. 0001) to water and cover sources. Based on the information obtained from the data analysis, management strategies for reducing hog impacts at the mine site were developed.
