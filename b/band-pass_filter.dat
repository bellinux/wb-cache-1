25|$|Temporal {{filtering}} is {{the removal}} of frequencies of no interest from the signal. A voxel's intensity change over time can be represented as the sum {{of a number of}} different repeating waves with differing periods and heights. A plot with these periods on the x-axis and the heights on the y-axis is called a power spectrum, and this plot is created with the Fourier transform technique. Temporal filtering amounts to removing the periodic waves not of interest to us from the power spectrum, and then summing the waves back again, using the inverse Fourier transform to create a new timecourse for the voxel. A high-pass filter removes the lower frequencies, and the lowest frequency that can be identified with this technique is the reciprocal of twice the TR. A low-pass filter removes the higher frequencies, while a <b>band-pass</b> <b>filter</b> removes all frequencies except the particular range of interest.|$|E

500|$|A {{waveguide}} stub filter is made {{by placing}} one or more stubs {{along the length of}} a waveguide, usually λg/4 apart, as shown in figure 12. [...] The ends of the stubs are blanked off to short-circuit them. [...] When the short-circuited stubs are λg/4 long the filter will be a band-stop filter and the stubs will have a lumped-element approximate equivalent circuit of [...] parallel resonant circuits connected in series with the line. [...] When the stubs are λg/2 long, the filter will be a <b>band-pass</b> <b>filter.</b> [...] In this case the lumped-element equivalent is series LC resonant circuits in series with the line.|$|E

2500|$|The diagram {{at right}} shows the block diagram {{of a typical}} single-conversion {{superheterodyne}} receiver. The diagram has blocks that are common to superheterodyne receivers. The antenna collects the radio signal. [...] The tuned RF stage with optional RF amplifier provides some initial selectivity; {{it is necessary to}} suppress the image frequency (see below), and may also serve to prevent strong out-of-passband signals from saturating the initial amplifier. A local oscillator provides the mixing frequency; it is usually a variable frequency oscillator which is used to tune the receiver to different stations. [...] The frequency mixer does the actual heterodyning that gives the superheterodyne its name; it changes the incoming radio frequency signal to a higher or lower, fixed, intermediate frequency (IF). [...] The IF <b>band-pass</b> <b>filter</b> and amplifier supply most of the gain and the narrowband filtering for the radio. [...] The demodulator extracts the audio or other modulation from the IF radio frequency; the extracted signal is then amplified by the audio amplifier.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{improved}} envelope analysis approach {{based on}} spectral kurtosis (SK) and complex shifted Morlet wavelet in the diagnostics of local gear faults is proposed in this paper. For enhancing impact signals of gear faults, a prewhitting process is performed {{to the original}} signals by autoregressive (AR) models firstly in the approach. Then, the envelopes of signals are extracted by Morlet wavelet filter family and the optimal center frequency and bandwidth of the <b>band-pass</b> <b>filters</b> is determined by SK. In the improved approach, not only the optimal parameters of the <b>band-pass</b> <b>filters</b> in envelope analysis can be obtained adaptively by, but also {{the number of the}} required <b>band-pass</b> <b>filters</b> can be reduced dramatically.

40|$|<b>Band-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> noise can be {{perceived}} {{to some degree}} as tonal. The perceived strength of this tonal quality depends on the spectral shape of the filtered noise {{and the presence of}} other features in the total sound. The spectral shape of bandpass filtered noise can be characterized by the center frequency, bandwidth, and roll-off rate of the filter. In order to determine the interaction between bandwidth and roll-off rate for <b>band-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> noise, the tonalness of <b>band-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> noise was evaluated by using three test methods: paired comparison, direct scaling, and an adaptive forced choice method. All three test methods yielded very similar results. Trapezoidal <b>band-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> random noise was used for the experiments. For a roll-off rate of 300 dB per octave, the tonalness of the sounds ranged from 30 to 90 percent of a pure tone's tonalness for a bandwidth of 300 to 1 percent of the critical bandwidth. For a roll-off rate of 100 dB per octave, the tonalness of the sounds ranged from 30 to 60 percent of a pure tone's tonalness. As the roll-off rate of the filtered sounds approachedzero, the tonalness disappears. 1...|$|R

40|$|Recently, <b>band-pass</b> {{photonic}} crystal <b>filters</b> have attracted great attention {{due to their}} important applications {{in the fields of}} optical interconnection network and ultrahigh speed information processing.

Two types of photonic crystal <b>band-pass</b> <b>filters</b> are utilized and optimized using the Two-dimensional finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) technique.

40|$|This paper {{critically}} {{assesses the}} practice of <b>band-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> (the non-structural, frequency-domain based decomposition of economic time series into trend and cyclical components), making two main points. First, it is shown that: (a) depending on the stochastic properties of the <b>filtered</b> process, the <b>band-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> cyclical component is entirely authentic, partly or mostly spurious, or even entirely spurious; and (b) as a simple consequence of the Lucas critique, the degree of authenticity of <b>band-pass</b> <b>filtered</b> cyclical components crucially depends on the monetary rule followed by the policy-maker. Second, taking a number of macroeconomic models as data-generation processes it is shown that band-pass filtering: (a) may markedly distort key business cycle stylised facts, as captured by the cross-correlations and the cross-spectral statistics between the cyclical components of the variables of interest and the cyclical component of GDP; and (b) may well create entirely spurious stylised facts. For example: both productivity and the money supply may appear procyclical even when they follow random walks by construction; the real wage may appear procyclical when {{in fact it is}} countercyclical; in general, the Phillips correlation between inflation and the cyclical component of economic activity will appear weaker than it is in reality. Again, the degree of authenticity of business cycle stylised facts uncovered via <b>band-pass</b> <b>filtering</b> crucially depends on the monetary rule followed by the policy-maker. ...|$|R
