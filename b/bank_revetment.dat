40|$|In China, the Lower Jingjiang Reach (LJR) of the Yangtze River {{could be}} one of the most {{complicated}} areas in terms of channel migration. The river had undergone many channel changes in the reach since the 18 th century. Intensive human activities in recent decades, such as the construction of upstream dams and revetments, had directly affected the channel migration characteristics. The revetment would significantly diminish migration, whereas the reduced sediment caused by dams would increase bank erosion and bank failure risks. Satellite imageries of Landsat Multi Spectral Scanner (MSS), Thematic Mapper (TM), Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) were employed to quantify the planform migration of the reach from 1983 to 2013 and to investigate the possible effect of human activities on the LJR channel evolution. Apart from the commonly used planform morphometric parameters, the migration direction was introduced to predict the future migration trends. Results showed that the LJR was gradually changing to a straighter channel, with sinuosity reducing from 2. 09 to 1. 9 and river length decreasing from 125. 32 km to 113. 31 km in the past 30 years. Planform morphometric parameters, such as migration rate of the channel centerline and erosion and deposition areas and rates, also decreased drastically in the past 30 years. The migration rate of the channel centerline decreased from 31. 05 m·year− 1 in 1983 – 1988 to 11. 62 m·year− 1 in 2009 – 2013. The lateral erosion and deposition areas decreased from 21. 32 and 25. 73 km 2 in 1983 – 1988 to 4. 83 and 5. 83 km 2 in 2009 – 2013. All of these findings indicate that the LJR tended to be in a steady state from 1983 to 2013 and was totally controlled by the <b>bank</b> <b>revetments.</b> However, the undercutting was strengthened because of the restrictive effect of revetments on lateral migration in the LJR. Moreover, the channel migrated to the left bank with a visible tendency as the total migration area to the left bank was approximately two times that of the right bank during the period. Consequently, the left bank of the LJR should be the focus of more attention in future migrations, and <b>bank</b> <b>revetments</b> of the left bank should be kept reinforced and adjusted with the change of water and sediment conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. —Large rivers {{worldwide}} {{have been}} altered by {{the construction and}} maintenance of navigation channels, which include extensive <b>bank</b> <b>revetments,</b> wing dikes, and levees. Using 7 years of Long-Term Resource Monitoring Program (LTRMP) data collected from the unimpounded upper Mississippi River, we investigated assemblages in two main-channel-border physical hab-itats—those with wing dikes and those without wing dikes. Fishes were captured using daytime electrofishing, mini-fyke netting, large hoop netting, and small hoop netting. Our objectives were to (1) assess associations among fish species richness, physical measurements, and main-channel-border physical habitats using stepwise multiple regression and indicator variables; (2) identify abundant adult and young-of-year (age- 0) families in both physical habitats to further investigate assemblage composition; and (3) calculate standardized species richness estimates within each physical habitat for adult and age- 0 fishes to provide additional information on community struc-ture. We found species richness was greater at wing dikes for both adult and age- 0 fishes when compared with main channel borders. Stepwise multiple regression revealed significant relation-ships between adult species richness and passive gear deployment (e. g., hoop nets and mini-fyke nets), physical habitat type, and river elevation, as well as interactions between physical habita...|$|R

40|$|Before 1900, the Missouri–Mississippi River system transported an {{estimated}} 400 {{million metric tons}} per year of sediment from {{the interior of the}} United States to coastal Louisiana. During the last two decades (1987 – 2006), this transport has averaged 145 million metric tons per year. The cause for this substantial decrease in sediment has been attributed to the trapping characteristics of dams constructed on the muddy part of the Missouri River during the 1950 s. However, reexamination of more than 60 years of water- and sediment-discharge data indicates that the dams alone are not the sole cause. These dams trap about 100 – 150 million metric tons per year, which represent about half the decrease in sediment discharge near the mouth of the Mississippi. Changes in relations between water discharge and suspended-sediment concentration suggest that the Missouri–Mississippi has been transformed from a transport-limited to a supply-limited system. Thus, other engineering activities such as meander cutoffs, river-training structures, and <b>bank</b> <b>revetments</b> as well as soil erosion controls have trapped sediment, eliminated sediment sources, or protected sediment that was once available for transport episodically throughout the year.

40|$|River channel {{movement}} processes {{necessary to}} maintain the natural heterogeneity in wildlife-dependent riparian ecosystems often conflict {{with the need to}} protect adjacent human infrastructure (e. g. towns, bridges, water pumps). This conflict can be avoided through long-term planning efforts which use process-based geomorphic simulation modeling to forecast potential long-term (> 50 years) landscape-level effects of water management decisions on river meander migration. We describe two management conflicts from the Sacramento River, California, USA, and analyze alternative management scenarios using results from a meander migration and cutoff simulation model. The first example shows that the existing rock revetment upstream from Woodson Bridge State Recreation Area alters the river meandering and causes erosion problems. Removing the revetment would relocate the channel and create a natural meander-neck chute cutoff, reducing erosion at the park while providing ecosystem benefits. The second example suggests that although a <b>bank</b> <b>revetment</b> is needed to prevent the river from moving away from a major water pump, removing an upstream <b>bank</b> <b>revetment</b> would provide habitat benefits without causing pump facility problems.

40|$|Traditional {{guidelines}} on rock protection at circular piers predominantly focus on preventing shear failure (by choosing a sufficiently large rock size), winnowing failure (by designing an appropriate filter) and edge failure (by selecting a sufficient extent). In particular areas (e. g. in an eroding river channel {{or in an}} area with large-scale bed forms), the rock protection may also face a degradation (lowering) of the bed. As a result, the edges will be undermined and stones will roll down and cover the newly developed slope (a falling apron). This process is not well understood and theoretically-based design guidelines for falling aprons are not available, only empirical relationships for <b>bank</b> <b>revetments.</b> Indicative laboratory experiments were conducted in order to derive guidelines to account for bed degradation {{in the design of}} rock protection at circular piers under currents. This paper summarizes the experimental set-up, monitoring techniques, test program and results of the conducted experiments. All tested rock protection layouts consisted of a single stone grading with a sufficient stone size and layer thickness to prevent shear failure and winnowing failure. In total, 7 live-bed tests were conducted with varying current velocities, bed degradation levels and rock layouts. During the tests, the bed protection level near the pier was monitored with video cameras. Before and after each test, the bathymetry was recorded by stereo-photography. The analysis focussed on the successive failure stages, the redistribution of stones over the slope and the evolution in time. The results showed that, as the undermining progressed, the stones {{at the edges of the}} protection were redistributed through a combination of rolling, sliding and sinking. Finally, a protective mound was formed, with stones covering the slopes on all sides. The observed stone layer thickness on the slopes gradually reduced towards the outside.

40|$|The Mississippi River {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{engineered}} rivers in the world. Levees, <b>bank</b> <b>revetments</b> and training dikes ensure navigability and safety against ?ooding. Construction of dams in the upstream branches led to a decay in sediment supply of 70 % during the last 100 years. Due to man-made constrictions, more sediment is spilled out in the Gulf of Mexico. In this Master Thesis, the Lower Mississippi River is subject to morphodynamic modeling with Delft 3 D to ?nd answers for the question, if there is a feasible way to restore the deltaic wetlands that su?er from high land loss rates due to land subsidence and sea-level rise without putting navigation at stake. In delta restoration plannings, sediment diversions play an important role as they convey sediment laden water to the marsh areas and, this way, largely contribute to new land-building. Several approaches are tested with the created model to understand the e?ect of altered ?ow and sediment discharge distributions on the morphology of the main channel. For a good approximation and description of the physical processes, the model comprises important factors such as dredging activities, diversion sites, salt water intrusion, and quasi-steady discharge periods. Several scenarios were tested, e. g. di?erent operation modes of planned sediment diversions and discharge distributions at Old River Control Structure. From the model outcome the conclusions can be drawn that a combination of a pulsed operation of ORCS and large-scale diversions as proposed by Parker et al. seems to be the most e?ective solution for wetland restoration in themodel domain as it only leads to similar deposition rates upstream of Venice, only slightly higher dredging volumes in the downstream reach and high sediment diversion, whereas the implementation of multiple diversions seems tbe more feasible, as they are already considered in the CWPPRA Masterplan. Moreover, it was found that additional groin ?elds can help to ensure navigability downstream of sediment diversions and thus mitigate negative morphological e?ects in the main channel. In the end, it must be emphasized that the application of additional diversions can stabilize local delta regions, but without higher sediment supply from upstream, the diverted amount of sediment is not su?cient for wetland restoration on a larger scale.

The effects of urbanization on watershed hydrology and stream geomorphology have been extensively explored. Streams in urban watersheds tend to increase in cross-sectional area, as changes in runoff-generating mechanisms result in larger peak flows than in non-urban watersheds. These geomorphic changes can have serious detrimental effects on both the quality of aquatic habitat and the stability of infrastructure and bridges. This study investigates historical channel changes in Alhambra Creek, focusing {{on the question of whether}} or not channel incision and expansion has occurred due to hydrologic changes since the 1950 s.

I studied two time periods (1952 and 1987) of a 127 -km study reach of the Sacramento River to document regeneration and spatial shifts in yellow-billed cuckoo habitat patches due to fluvial geomorphic processes, vegetation recruitment and succession over a 35 -year period. The spatial co-occurrence of natural riparian vegetation and floodplain age < 65 years were used to identify sub-patches of cottonwood forest, a preferred habitat element, within larger patches of contiguous riparian forest. Only 247 ha (15 %) of the 1664 ha of habitat sub-patches identified in 1952 were coincident with those in 1987. Seventeen (27 %) of the 62 sub-patches delineated for 1987 emerged anew and independently of the 1952 patches; the remaining 83 % formed by shifting adjacent to the patches from 1952. Comparing observation data (1987 - 1990) with modelled patches (1987) indicates that 79 % of the modelled sub-patches correctly predicted cuckoo presence or absence. The commission and omission errors were 7 % and 14 %, respectively. The goal of sustaining the yellow-billed cuckoo population will require that river channel management encourage channel meander dynamics and channel cut-off to maintain natural regeneration of cottonwood and willow pioneer plant communities.

40|$|Stream {{restoration}} efforts often aim {{at creating}} new unconstrained meandering channels without weirs and <b>bank</b> <b>revetments.</b> In reconstructed streams, the initial morphological {{response of the}} new streams is often rapid, until a dynamic equilibrium is reached. Here we report on a chute cutoff that occurred within 3 months after realization of a stream restoration project, caused by a plug bar that formed {{in response to a}} backwater effect. The temporal evolution of the morphology of both the new and the old channels was monitored over a period of nearly 8 months, including precutoff conditions. The observations can be separated into three stages. Stage 1 is the initial period leading to cutoff vulnerability, stage 2 is the actual cutoff, and stage 3 is the morphological adjustment in response to the cutoff. In stage 1, a plug bar was deposited in one of the channel bends. Hydrodynamic model results show the location of the plug bar coincides with a region where bed shear stress decreased in downstream direction due to backwater. Longitudinal channel bed profiles show that the channel slope decreased soon after channel reconstruction. Hence, sediment from upstream was available to form the plug bar. After the plug bar was deposited, an embayment formed in the floodplain at a location where the former channel was located (stage 2). The former channel was filled with sediment prior to channel construction. It is likely that the sediment at this location was less consolidated, and therefore, prone to erosion. The chute channel continued to incise and widen into the floodplain and, after 6 months, acted as the main channel, conveying the discharge during the majority of time (stage 3). The cutoff channel gradually continued to fill with sediment, from the moment the plug bar formed until the chute channel incised into the floodplain. Sedimentary successions of the deposited material show upward fining, which is in agreement with observations of chute cutoffs in rivers. Although the artificial setting limits the degree in which the observed processes can be projected on natural rivers, the observations prompt to investigate the role of backwater effects in natural chute cutoff initiation. </p...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1968 Taking {{advantage}} of a favorable physical system but also risking the hazards of flooding, man has long occupied flood plain land. He has attempted to adjust rivers to his needs {{in order to reduce}} flood loss, but the rising cost of flood protection accompanied by an increase in flood damage potential warrants that a course of human adjustment be undertaken on occupied flood plains. The flood plain of the Willamette River between Albany and Corvallis, Oregon provides an opportunity to study the resource use of a flood plain in a relatively youthful stage of economic development, having the physical as sets and limitations of most flood plains. By studying the physical system and changing resource utilization of this flood plain, an evaluation has been made of the present and possible future use of its resource base. Land use has evolved from a primitive stage of hunting, fishing, and gathering to intensive agricultural endeavors with some residential and commercial development. Resource utilization during the same period has changed from a dependence on the flora and fauna for food and clothing to a dependence on the soil and climate, flood protection, markets, labor, and so forth. The change has been towards a more intensive, higher valued use of the land with more sophisticated land management practices. A relatively satisfactory arrangement of land use presently exists on the Albany-Corvallis flood plain; however, present land use practices in the study area reflect a rational use of flood subjected land primarily because the pressures of industrial and commercial development have not yet been heavily felt. Residential expansion, however, has taken place at an alarming rate. Many of the human adjustments suggested by Gilbert White in his flood plain studies at the University of Chicago are applicable to a future course of orderly occupance for the Albany-Corvallis flood plain. One of the more applicable local forms of adjustment is the directing of flood plain use which involves land elevation, land use regulation, structural modifications, flood insurance, relief, and better warning systems. The construction of engineering works for flood abatement represents the traditional form of river adjustment in the Willamette Basin. The building of storage dams upstream of the study area has lowered the height of the flood crest but has also given many flood plain dwellers a feeling of false security. Channel improvements and <b>bank</b> <b>revetments</b> are the main form of river adjustment in the study area, and they help to reduce the danger of crop drowning and to control bank erosion...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural river banks have been {{transformed}} into <b>banks</b> with artificial <b>revetments</b> or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion. Important river features for flora and fauna have disappeared and the ecological quality of the river reduced dramatically. Recently, the importance of the ecological function of rivers has been getting more attention. One river restoration measure is the removal of man-made bank protections to increase habitat diversity and biodiversity of riparian areas and the river basin. The river morphology may change due to the freely eroding banks in the restored section. Reference projects show that the removal of bank protection along rivers may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Schirmer et al., 2014). Bars increase morphological diversity, providing specific habitats for flora and fauna (Kurth and Schirmer, 2014). There is a lack of knowledge about the formation of bars related to the length and location of the removal of bank protection. The length of river bank protection removal is usually limited, due to human activities along the riversides. Therefore, a guideline is needed for the design of bank protection removal to enhance habitat diversity through bar formation to make this a feasible river restoration method.

40|$|This study {{utilized}} a new {{database of}} levee failures along 685 km of the Middle and Lower Mississippi River from St. Louis, MO to Memphis, TN {{during the past}} 120 years. The goals of this investigation were to: 1) identify {{the relative importance of}} geologic and geomorphic factors that have led to levee failures through the past century along the Mississippi River and 2) measure levee crest elevations to determine if they have increased or decreased between 1998 and 2007 and if they are built to the proper design grade elevation. Logistic regression analysis was utilized to examine selected site characteristics at each levee failure location. These site characteristics (levee failure parameters) included: 1) levee underlain by previous channel fill, 2) presence/absence of borrow pit, 3) location of failure on a meander bend, 4) width of channel, 5) width of floodway, 6) constriction-over-time factor, 7) land-cover type, 8) width of vegetative buffer, 9) sinuosity of channel, 10) intensity of dredging, and 11) presence/absence of <b>bank</b> <b>revetment.</b> Each of these parameters was evaluated using geologic maps, soil survey data, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), historic river maps, and dredging reports (Winkley, 1977; Pinter et al., 2004). Two models were created for each river reach. The first model for both reaches used a  95 % significance threshold, while the second model for the MMR used a  80 % significance threshold, and the second model for the LMR used a  90 % significance threshold. The first model for the Middle Mississippi River (MMR) identified only the presence/absence of channel fills to predict levee failure as significant, had an R² value of 0. 178, a p-value of 0. 002, and a percentage accuracy of 68. 6 %. The second model for the MMR identified the following variables as significant: presence/absence of channel fills to predict levee failure, location of failure on a meander bend, channel width, land-cover type, and intensity of dredging. This model had an R 2 value of 0. 408, p-value of 0. 002, and a percentage accuracy of 74. 3 %. The  95 % model for the Lower Mississippi River (LMR) identified location of failure on a meander bend, land-cover type, constriction-over-time factor, and sinuosity of the channel as significant. This model had an R 2 value of 0. 326, p-value of 0. 003, and a percentage accuracy of 69. 5 %. The 90 % LMR model identified the following variables as significant: the presence/absence of borrow pits, location of failure on meander bend, channel width, land-cover type, constriction-over-time factor, vegetative buffer width, channel sinuosity, and presence/absence of <b>bank</b> <b>revetment.</b> This model had an R 2 value of 0. 385, p-value of 0. 006, and a percentage accuracy of 72. 0 %. The MMR and LMR models with the  95 % significance threshold had no predictors in common because of differences between the two river reaches or possibly because of the small sample size. However, the expanded MMR and LMR models shared three predictors (i. e., meander location, channel width, and land cover type). The second portion of this project used post-processed dual-frequency GPS surveying to measure levee elevations between St. Louis, MO and Cairo, IL. These elevations were compared to the 50 -year design flood grade elevations and to a 1998 DEM to identify areas of levee heightening, levee degradation and/or subsidence, and locations of past levee crevasses. This surveying revealed areas that, between 1998 and 2007, were raised up to ~ 1. 5 meters and other areas that degraded or subsided up to ~ 1. 0 meter. Also, the locations of five recent levee crevasses were investigated, showing local increases or decreases at those points. The importance of levee road construction type was identified through many sharp increases or decreases at the transition between road types. Overall, this project showed promising implications for the determination of levee failure susceptibility and proper levee elevation heights using logistic regression analysis and kinematic GPS surveying. The logistic regression models predicted the potential for levee failure based on local site characteristics of levees between St. Louis, MO and Memphis, TN. The high-precision kinematic GPS surveying illustrated levee elevations along the MMR to a high degree of accuracy, allowing for the rapid and efficient identification of areas that do not correspond to the proper design flood grade elevation...|$|E
40|$|The New York City (NYC) Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) is the City agency {{responsible}} for operating, maintaining and protecting NYC's water supply and distribution system which includes monitoring and maintaining water quality standards through watershed management and protection. Warner Creek, located in the Ashokan Watershed of the eastern Catskill Mountains, is {{an important source of}} water for NYC and has been identified as a contributor of sediment loading. A primary goal of the DEP is to maintain stream system stability by working with partner organizations to carry out research into understanding the cause of water quality degradation linked to the physical condition of stream watersheds. As part of the SUNY New Paltz Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) program, students collaborated with the DEP throughout the summer of 2010 to conduct a full stream assessment of Warner Creek. At the reach scale, major stream features (natural and anthropogenic) were located and inventoried including large woody debris (LWD), bedform, fine sediment sources, <b>bank</b> erosion, <b>revetments,</b> culverts, and bridges {{along the length of the}} stream. These features were then inserted into a GIS and further analyzed using 3 meter LiDAR data. Three reaches were then chosen based on similar gradients, length, LWD occurrences, stream bedform, and bank substrate. These reaches then were then compared and contrasted to constrain LWD occurrences and its influence on geomorphic features and its overall effect on turbidity. Potential contributors to turbidity include hill slope failures, bank erosion, and anthropogenic influences such as land use. LWD was found to entrain sediment and in some cases cause scouring however, knick point migration was found to not be associated with LWD occurrences. Stream corridor width and sinuosity within the reaches were found to be important factors in LWD occurrences. Increased values of sinuosity correlated with the density of LWD occurrences. Narrow stream corridors containing LWD were associated with channel spanning and avulsion. Wider corridors had lower gradients and contained larger amounts of LWD relative to narrow corridors. These results can be of further use to the DEP in focusing their stream management efforts in certain areas of Warner Creek...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{forest road}} {{management}} issues have focused more frequently on roads within riparian areas. This includes {{every aspect of}} managing existing roads, from prioritizing aquatic habitat restoration, to understanding risks and watershed health, to road location, storm damage repair, and road maintenance. Current direction and changes in priority (i. e., Northwest Forest Plan, Aquatic Conservation Strategy), suggest {{a change in the}} way that encroachment problems are approached. Watershed analysis and management under the Aquatic Conservation Strategy (ACS) imply an understanding of processes, cause and effect, and managing (reducing or eliminating) hazards in priority areas such as Key Watersheds, riparian areas, and areas adjacent to important aquatic species habitat. Traditional standards of practice, such as <b>bank</b> hardening and <b>revetment</b> construction, can be very effective for protecting infrastructure, but are increasingly viewed as being incompatible with aquatic resource objectives. These techniques are now closely scrutinized, and approaching such problems in the traditional mode invites controversy. Designs and solutions should reflect this change of attitude. Questions now being asked at the planning and design phase include: What do we know about natural conditions, active processes, and the range of natural variability? Can the design at a site emulate local processes or a designated reference condition? Looking at analysis at several scales often provides insights. Examples from the Olympic National Forest, Washington, illustrate these considerations and some of the links between site conditions, physical processes, and the resulting design solutions...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} centuries natural riverbanks have been {{transformed}} into <b>banks</b> with artificial <b>revetments</b> or sheet piles {{to protect them from}} erosion, which led to disappearance of important river features for flora and fauna. River restoration projects show that the removal of man-made bank protections may lead to the formation of bars (e. g. Van den Berghe et al., 2012; Schirmer et al., 2014). Habitat diversity in rivers may be enhanced through the formation of river bars with preferably diversity in bar height, size and location. This research aims at gaining knowledge into the effects of removing riverbank protections on bar formation to enhance habitat diversity. Mobile-bed flume experiments were performed in the Fluid Mechanics Laboratory of Delft University of Technology. The experiments were focussed on bar formation related to three variables of a bank protection removal; length, location and flow asymmetry. Geometrical and morphodynamic characteristics were selected for the experiment having a bar mode of one to obtain a system with alternate bars (Crosato and Mosselman, 2009) and showed gravel-bed river similarity based on bankfull river characteristics of Parker (2004). The experimental flume consisted of a 6. 2 metre long and 0. 2 metre wide straight channel with 0. 5 metre wide floodplains on the sides. On both sides of the channel, bank protection could be removed over a limited length with optionally a groyne upstream. After seven hours {{at the end of each}} test, photos of the bed topography were taken and the longitudinal bed profile was measured. Bar wavelengths and bar heights in each experimental test were determined from detrended bed profiles. The bar height was divided in two classes: low and high. The areas of low bars, high bars, floodplains and the deep channel were determined from photos of the final bed topographies. Bar types were indicated with terminology from Duró et al. (2015) as forced, free or hybrid. Removal of bank protections resulted in lateral erosion of channel banks over a limited length. The eroded bank line moved in downstream direction, which agrees with the downstream meander migration observed in field and laboratory investigations by many authors (e. g. Odgaard, 1987). Scour holes developed downstream of the widened section, due to turbulent eddies forced by the channel geometry. In the widened reach, flow decelerated which resulted in a lower sediment transport. Consequently, sediment was deposited in the widened reach and caused rising of the mean bed level along with formation of bars. In areas with higher flow velocities an increased sediment transport deepened the channel. When the riverbanks were fixed, relatively low, small, side bars were formed in the channel. In general, the total bar area and bar height increased for an increase in channel widening, due to the removal of bank protection. An increased bank protection removal length up to nine times the channel width or an upstream asymmetrical flow forcing, i. e. groyne, increased the total bar area, whereas a bank protection removal at three different locations with a total length of nine times the channel width did not significantly increased the total bar area. It is recommended to remove riverbank protections over a length of at least nine times the river width on both sides of the river with optionally a groyne upstream as a measure to enhance habitat diversity. It is also valuable to remove the bank protection on one side of the river only. It is advised to construct a groyne upstream of the bank protection removal to increase habitat diversity. This research led to results that can be used in further research. It is advised to conduct larger scale experiments and eventually move to the field.
