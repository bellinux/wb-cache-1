50|$|Together {{with the}} phenotypically similar Malayan peacock-pheasant and -Palawan peacock-pheasant it {{represents}} a basal group in its genus; their radiation probably {{took place during the}} PlioceneBeing very poorly known, the <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> was long considered to be a subspecies of the Malayan peacock-pheasant, but the two species are well-isolated geographically. The highly specialised anterior breast and upper neck plumage of male <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> males are quite distinctive. Females of the two species are more difficult to distinguish. The retrices of the Bornean species are morphologically and patterned intermediate between Palawan and Malayan peacock-pheasants.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron schleiermacheri) is a {{medium-sized}} pheasant. It {{is probably the}} rarest and certainly the least known of all peacock-pheasants. This elusive bird is endemic to lowland forests of Borneo.|$|E
50|$|Because {{of ongoing}} habitat loss, small {{population}} size, and limited range, the <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> is evaluated as Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. It is listed on Appendix II of CITES.|$|E

In {{addition}} to his jewelry and sculpture, he currently runs the Roughwood Aviary which is dedicated to breeding peafowl and pheasants, including Onagadori chickens and rare species such as the great argus pheasant and the Malay and <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasants.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Malayan peacock-pheasant (Polyplectron malacense) {{also known}} as crested peacock-pheasant or Malaysian peacock-pheasant, is a {{medium-sized}} pheasant of the galliform family Phasianidae. The closely related <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (P. schleiermacheri) was formerly included here as a subspecies, but as understood today, P. malacense is monotypic.|$|E

5000|$|... mtDNA {{cytochrome}} b and D-loop {{as well as}} {{the nuclear}} ovomucoid intron G sequence data places the Malayan peacock-pheasant within the basal radiation of its genus, together with the even more elusive <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> (P. schleiermacheri) [...] - [...] and Palawan peacock-pheasant (P. napoleonis). The common ancestor of the Malay peacock-pheasants probably diverged from its relatives during the Pliocene or maybe Late Miocene, about 5 million years ago (Ma) perhaps.|$|E

The Mahakam hosts the freshwater dolphin Irrawaddy Dolphin (Orcaella brevirostris; called Pesut by local people) a critically endangered species, which is included on CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora) Appendix I.http://www.globalnature.org/bausteine.net/file/showfile.aspx?downdaid=6866&sp=E&domid=1011&fd=2 The Mahakam river basin {{is also an important}} breeding and resting place for 298 bird species, among them 70 protected and five endemic species: Borneo Dusky Mannikin (Lonchura fuscans), Borneo Whistler (Pachycephala hypoxantha), <b>Bornean</b> <b>Peacock-pheasant</b> (Polyplectron schleiermacheri), Bornean Blue-flycatcher (Cyornis superbus) and Bornean Bristlehead (Pityriasis gymnocephala).http://www.globalnature.org/docs/02_vorlage.asp?id=28145&domid=1011&sp=E&m1=11089&m2=17952&m3=20076&m4=28145 ...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{distribution}} and habitat-use of two endemic ground birds, the Borneon groundcuckoo Carpococcyx radiatus and the Bornean peacockpheasant Polyplectron schleiermacheri in the Sungai Wain protection Forest, East Kalimantan. Both species are highly elusive and neither has been subject to any in-depth study. Consequently, few data are available on their population numbers, habitat preferences and conservation status. We mapped the species' presence in five topographical habitat types, assessed their spatial distribution, and provide an estimate of population sizes in the reserve. Over a period of 44 months (1997 - 2003) we had 32 encounters with Bornean ground-cuckoo, and 19 encounters with <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasant.</b> Number of encounters increased over time, but no seasonal or monthly difference was apparent in encounter rate. Both species were only observed inside the central core of the reserve. Bornean ground-cuckoo showed a clear preference for alluvial and swamp forest over highflat, slope and ridge forest. <b>Bornean</b> <b>peacock-pheasant</b> showed no clear preference {{for any of these}} five habitat types. Considering the rapid destruction of forest occurring in Kalimantan due to illegal logging, fires, lack of law enforcement and proper management of protected areas, the conservation of these two species is discussed in relation to conservation management of the Sungai Wain Protection Forest. Teams are protolling year-round in the reserve to halt hunting, illegal logging has been eradicated by these patrols, in combination with treespiking. Fire breaks are maintained each dry season to avoid further fire damage, and extensive education and awareness work is carried out in the district...|$|E
