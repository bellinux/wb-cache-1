For two years after graduation, he stayed with the university to teach, and from 1969 to 1971 he was a law professor {{as well as the}} president of the Board of Trustees of Alpha Tau Omega, the fraternity he had joined while an undergraduate at the university.|$|E

500|$|Weinberg {{grew up in}} {{suburban}} New Jersey and began drumming at an early age.

500|$|The future senator {{was not a}} good student, but at {{an early}} age began to love oratory and the written word. Borah was educated at Tom's Prairie School, near Fairfield. [...] When Borah {{exhausted}} its rudimentary resources, he was sent by his father in 1881 to Southern Illinois Academy, a Cumberland Presbyterian academy at Enfield to train for the ministry. The 63 students there included two future U.S. senators, Borah and Wesley Jones, who would represent the state of Washington; the two often debated as schoolboys. Instead of becoming a preacher, Borah was in 1882 expelled for hitching rides on the Illinois Central {{to spend the night in}} the town of Carmi. He ran away from home with an itinerant Shakespearean company, but his father persuaded him to return. In his late teenage years, he became interested in the law, and later stated, [...] "I can't remember when I didn't want to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer...</b> there is no other profession where one can be absolutely independent".|$|E
500|$|With {{his father}} finally {{accepting}} his ambition to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> {{rather than a}} clergyman, Borah in 1883 {{went to live with}} his sister Sue in Lyons, Kansas; her husband, Ansel M. Lasley, was an attorney. [...] Borah initially worked as a teacher, but became so engrossed in historical topics at the town library that he was ill-prepared for class; he and the school parted ways. In 1885 Borah enrolled at the University of Kansas, and rented an inexpensive room in a professor's home in Lawrence; he studied alongside students who would become prominent, such as William Allen White and Fred Funston. Borah was working his way through college, but his plans were scuttled when he contracted tuberculosis in early 1887, and had to return to Lyons, where his sister nursed him to health and he began to read law under Ansel Lasley's supervision. The bar examination was rudimentary and Borah passed it in September 1887, going into partnership with his brother-in-law.|$|E

500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} survives in The Moving Picture World from September 10, 1910. It states: [...] "The play deals with Will Allen, a country lad, who is unhappy at home, owing {{to the fact that}} he is a studious little chap and prefers his books to farm work, which incurs the displeasure and enmity of his stepfather, a rough and surly farmer, to whom book learning does not appeal. Will runs away from home, and although his mother keeps a light in the window, hoping to guide her boy home, he never returns. Twenty years later, when the boy has made a place for himself in the world as a successful lawyer, he goes back to the farm, only to find that his little mother, who has been left a widow, has gone away, whither, no one knows. The mother, in the meantime, being left alone in the world, goes to the city and there supports herself by dressmaking. While shopping in a department store she is unjustly accused of shoplifting. The only person who believes in her innocence is a salesgirl, who is discharged for her presumption and daring to correct her superiors. The girl, in her efforts to help the friendless old lady, enlists the aid of Will, whom she knows to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>lawyer</b> of great ability. Will is about to refuse the case, as the dry goods company is a client of his, when the girl describes the lonely old lady, and begs him for the sake of his mother to befriend her. Will consents. Will's clear statement of the case to the judge, together with May's testimony, frees the mother. When her counsel approaches to offer his congratulations, mutual recognition results." ...|$|E

2500|$|When Anthony {{tried to}} speak at the New York State Teachers' Association meeting in 1853, her attempt sparked a half-hour debate among the men about whether it was proper for women to speak in public.
