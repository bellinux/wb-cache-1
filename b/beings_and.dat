5|$|According to Jainism, no single, {{specific}} statement {{can describe}} {{the nature of}} existence and the absolute truth. This knowledge (Kevala Jnana), it adds, is comprehended only by the Arihants. Other <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> their statements about absolute truth are incomplete, and at best a partial truth. Anekāntavāda is a fundamental doctrine of Jainism.|$|E
5000|$|To {{solve the}} paradox we say: {{we should not}} concede that if it is false then one of his {{sentences}} (kalām) is true. For its being true is taken to be the conjunction of its <b>being</b> true <b>and</b> <b>being</b> false. Therefore its being false necessitates the non-conjunction of its <b>being</b> true <b>and</b> <b>being</b> false. <b>And</b> the non-conjunction of its <b>being</b> true <b>and</b> <b>being</b> false does not necessitateits being true.|$|R

5|$|During the Hellenistic period, mythology {{took on the}} {{prestige}} of elite knowledge that marks its possessors as belonging to a certain class. At the same time, the skeptical turn of the Classical age became even more pronounced. Greek mythographer Euhemerus established the tradition of seeking an actual historical basis for mythical <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> events. Although his original work (Sacred Scriptures) is lost, much is known about it from what is recorded by Diodorus and Lactantius.|$|E
5|$|Humans are {{corporeal}} <b>beings</b> <b>and,</b> as such, {{they are}} subject to examination and description by the natural sciences. Since mental processes are intimately related to bodily processes, the descriptions that the natural sciences furnish of human beings {{play an important role in}} the philosophy of mind. There are many scientific disciplines that study processes related to the mental. The list of such sciences includes: biology, computer science, cognitive science, cybernetics, linguistics, medicine, pharmacology, and psychology.|$|E

5|$|Of these precepts, Mahavira is most {{remembered in}} the Indian traditions for his teachings of ahimsa (non-injury) {{as the supreme}} ethical and moral virtue. Mahavira taught that the {{doctrine}} of non-injury must cover all living <b>beings,</b> <b>and</b> causing injury to any being in any form creates bad karma which affects one's rebirth and future well-being and suffering. According to Mahatma Gandhi, Mahāvīra was the greatest authority on Ahimsa.|$|E

The living beings hurt by such a man {{take the form of}} savage serpent-like beasts called rurus and torture this person.

5|$|The Bahá'í {{writings}} {{emphasize the}} essential equality of human <b>beings,</b> <b>and</b> {{the abolition of}} prejudice. Humanity is seen as essentially one, though highly varied; its diversity of race and culture are seen as worthy of appreciation and acceptance. Doctrines of racism, nationalism, caste, social class, and gender-based hierarchy are seen as artificial impediments to unity. The Bahá'í teachings state that the unification of humanity is the paramount issue in the religious and political conditions of the present world.|$|E

50|$|Traditional {{religions}} in Sub-Saharan Africa often display complex ontology, cosmology and metaphysics. Mythologies, for example, {{demonstrated the}} difficulty fathers of creation had {{in bringing about}} order from chaos. Order is {{what is right and}} natural and any deviation is chaos. Cosmology and ontology is also neither simple or linear. It defines duality, the material and immaterial, male and female, heaven and earth. Common principles of <b>being</b> <b>and</b> becoming are widespread: Among the Dogon, the principle of Amma (<b>being)</b> <b>and</b> Nummo (becoming), and among the Bambara, Pemba (<b>being)</b> <b>and</b> Faro (becoming).|$|R

The four gatis are: deva (demi-gods), manuṣya (humans), nāraki (hell <b>beings)</b> <b>and</b> tiryañca (animals, plants and micro-organisms). The four gatis have four corresponding realms or habitation levels in the vertically tiered Jain universe: demi-gods occupy the higher levels where the heavens are situated; humans, plants and animals occupy the middle levels; and hellish beings occupy the lower levels where seven hells are situated.|$|E

Infection Forms, the true form of the Flood, are fragile <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> do little damage individually, but often travel in swarms of several dozen in order to infect their prey. Combat Forms result from humans and Covenant Elites who have succumbed to the Infection Forms, and have hideously deformed bodies as a result. Bloated Carrier Forms {{are the result of}} an aged or unused Combat Form and serve as incubators for new Infection Forms; when wounded or near a potential victim, they explode to damage other nearby life-forms and to release their spores, thus perpetuating the Flood life cycle.|$|E

5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to embrace him, blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial <b>beings,</b> <b>and</b> sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E

In Digital Devil Saga 2, two new main characters are introduced Roland, the alcoholic leader of the Lokapala resistance group and Madame Margot Cuvier, head of the Karma Society.

They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions.

5|$|Some {{believers in}} a 2012 doomsday claimed that a planet called PlanetX, or Nibiru, would collide with or pass by the Earth.

The idea originated from claims of channeling alien <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> is widely ridiculed.

5|$|The {{battle was}} also immortalized in the Hungarian epic poem Szigeti Veszedelem ("Peril of Sziget"), written in fifteen parts by Zrinski's {{great-grandson}} Nicholas VII of Zrin (also a Ban of Croatia) in 1647 {{and published in}} 1651. This {{was one of the}} first such epics in the Hungarian language and was also inspired by Marulić's Judita. Kenneth Clark's renowned history Civilisation lists the Szigeti Veszedelem as one of the major literary achievements of the 17th century. In spite of the author and other members of Zrinski family being fierce enemies of the Turks, the poem never demonizes them. The Turks are portrayed as human <b>beings</b> <b>and</b> a love story between Deliman the Tatar and the Sultan's daughter Cumilla is interwoven into the main plot.|$|E
