50|$|In a riveted steel ship, the strakes {{were usually}} lapped and joggled, but where a {{smoother}} finish was sought, they too might be riveted on a <b>butt</b> <b>strap,</b> {{though this was}} weaker. In modern welded construction, the plates are normally butt-welded all round to adjoining plates within the strake and to adjoining strakes.|$|E
50|$|Wooden planks can be scarfed into a strake by {{suitably}} tapering {{the thickness}} of the adjoining ends. Traditionally, the adjoining faces were coated with mixed white lead and grease, then held together with copper rivets. It was important to not have the plank end as thin as a feather edge and to have the outboard thin edge at the after end of the joint. In later times, after adhesives had been developed by the aircraft industry, the joint might be made with resin glue and no rivets. In heavier carvel work, the joint would be a butt, riveted to a <b>butt</b> <b>strap.</b> Even large clinker vessels had scarfed strakes as in this form of construction; the strakes contribute a significant proportion of the structural strength of the boat as well as keeping it water-tight.|$|E
40|$|Modern acrylic {{adhesives}} {{make possible}} the bonding {{of glass and}} polycarbonate in large sheets of laminated glass using thin adhesive layers. Glass polycarbonate laminates with thin adhesive layers should have good mechanical properties and thus allow for lighter transparent constructions. Asymmetric double <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> specimens of glass and polycarbonate were manufactured using photobond 53517 adhesive. These were tested at room temperature in laboratory air in zwick Z 10 universal testing machines. Specimens were tensile tested at different strain rates and subjected to creep and low cycle fatigue tests with different hold times. The results show that several mechanisms are active in a fatigue cycle. Damage is mainly {{a function of the}} hold time at maximum stress rather than a cycle by cycle approach. No single stress/time or strain time parameter can explain the results...|$|E
50|$|The {{cylinders}} {{were arranged}} horizontally {{and outside the}} engine frame. The slide valves, mounted above the cylinders, were actuated by Stephenson's Link motion. The engine's boiler barrel setions were not arranged telescopically, but were jointed end-to-end with <b>butt</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{deformation}} and adhesive stresses in bonded single <b>strap</b> <b>butt</b> joints were theoretically studied. An equation {{with a weak}} coupling {{relation between}} the peel and shear stresses was noticed in the literature, and an incorrect track to derive the peel stress closed-form solution suggested by past researchers was identified. This incorrect track has been overlooked for nearly 30 years due to the difficulties and complexities in the mathematical aspect of solving high order differential equation. Mathematical difficulties in the analysis were solved and thus closed-form solutions for both the adhesive peel and shear stresses have been successfully developed in this study. In the proposed solutions the adherends and doublers can be different in material and thickness. Good agreement in the adhesive stresses between the closed-form solutions and finite element results was achieved for the joints. Parametric studies of the bending moments at the bonded overlap edges, and the adhesive stresses under the influences of several factors, were carried out. The closed-form solutions could be further extended to specific laminated composite joints for a wide practical application. Peer reviewed: NoNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this study is on the {{suitability}} in the application of classical laminate theory analysis tools for filament wound pressure vessels with adhesive laminated joints in particular: pressure vessel wall performance, joint stiffness and failure prediction. Two 18 -inch diameter 12 -ply filament wound pressure vessels were fabricated. One vessel was fabricated with a 24 -ply pyramid laminated adhesive double <b>strap</b> <b>butt</b> joint. The second vessel was fabricated with the same number of plies in an inverted pyramid joint. Results from hydrostatic tests are presented. Experimental results were used as input to the computer programs GENLAM and Laminate, and the output compared to test. By using the axial stress resultant, the classical laminate theory results show a correlation within 1 % to the experimental results in predicting the pressure vessel wall pressure performance. The prediction of joint stiffness for the two adhesive joints in the axial direction is within 1 % of the experimental results. The calculated hoop direction joint stress resultant is 25 % less than the measured resultant for both joint configurations. A correction factor is derived and used in the joint analysis. The correction factor is derived from the hoop stress resultant from the tank wall performance investigation. The vessel with the pyramid joint is determined to have failed in the joint area at a hydrostatic pressure 33 % value below predicted failure. The vessel with the inverted pyramid joint failed in the wall acreage at a hydrostatic pressure within 10 % of the actual failure pressure...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{composite}} {{components are}} {{being considered for}} a wide variety of demanding applications in aerospace, space exploration, and ground based systems. A number of these applications require robust integration technologies to join dissimilar materials (metalcomposites) into complex structural components. In this study, three types of composites (C-C, C-SiC, and SiC-SiC) were vacuum brazed to commercially pure Ti using the active metal braze alloy Cusil-ABA (63 Ag- 35. 3 Cu- 1. 75 Ti). Composite substrates with as fabricated and polished surfaces were used for brazing. The microstructure and composition of the joint, examined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) coupled with energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS), showed sound metallurgical bonding in all systems. The <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> tensile (BST) test was performed on bonded specimens at room and elevated temperatures. Effect of substrate composition, interlaminar properties, and surface roughness on the mechanical properties and failure behavior of joints will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{adhesive}} as {{a structural}} fastener is progressively {{taking place in}} shipbuilding. However, a series of issues needs {{to be looked at}} such as ageing and influence of the tolerance in the adhesive application in order to enhance the knowledge of this technology and reinforce its use in this industry. This paper hence presents the work carried out on <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> adhesive joints bonding metallic adherends. The influence of adhesive thickness under different ageing conditions on the performance of the joints was investigated. Finite element analysis was carried out to model the joint behaviour taking into account geometric non-linear effects to explain the mechanisms leading to failure. Different failure modes were identified, depending on the level of adhesive thickness. The finite element analysis confirms experimental observations that failure initiated at the horizontal adhesive free surface. Accelerated ageing of the joints suggests interfacial degradation at the steel interface {{at the edges of the}} joint overlap...|$|E
40|$|Experimental {{analysis}} of the stresses and strains in a glass fibre polymer composite double <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> joint using digital image correlation (DIC) is described in the paper. Initially the strain fields through {{the thickness of the}} joint are derived from DIC measurements, capturing the effect of the initiation and development of cracks in the joint up to failure. It is demonstrated that the relatively small strains developed in the through-thickness direction are critical in the development of damage in the joint at the geometric discontinuity between the adherends. An experimental methodology is established to perform DIC at the mesoscopic scale, enabling accurate, high spatial resolution {{analysis of}} the small through-thickness strains around the discontinuity. The DIC enables the strains to be evaluated, their development monitored and hence establish their contribution to the failure process. To determine the full-field stresses in the joint experimentally derived materials properties are used. From component stress maps principal stresses maps are derived, which clearly show where the damage is initiating and its subsequent growth in the composite adherends until final failure of the joint...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{degradation}} and failure of protective coatings (paints and sealants) {{is a key}} element influencing the service life of aircraft. Such degradation is influenced by the response of coatings to environmental factors such as high temperatures and exposure to ultraviolet radiation, as well as chemical factors. However, the effect of loading and load history on coating durability has received little attention, despite clearly being a factor in determining failure sites (such as joints) and the rate of degradation. This paper describes the key characteristics of coatings at aircraft joints, {{and the nature of the}} strains experienced by coatings in locations influenced by in-service loads. It is first step in assessing the complex strain history at joint strain concentration locations as part of developing a prognostic capability for the service life of aircraft coatings. The configuration of coating layers at different joints is important and this research has considered a simplification of a <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> joint from a RAAF military aircraft and a generic lap joint; predictions of critical movements/displacements have been made using finite element analysis; the predictions will be tested later as part of an experimental program associated with a full-scale fatigue test...|$|E
40|$|Pultruded {{composites}} {{are usually}} manufactured by pulling fibres {{that have been}} immersed in resin through a heated die. The material is layered, usually with the main component being {{a thick layer of}} unidirectional material (UD). This is often sandwiched between outer layers of a randomly orientated material. In the current work the outer layers comprise a chopped strand mat (CSM) material stitched on a woven roving mat, known as complex mat (CM). For protection purposes, a thin layer of material, known as a ‘surface veil’, that consists of thermoplastic fibres wetted with polyester resin is deposited on the surface. Investigations into bonded pultruded <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> joints have been carried out by the authors showing that the joint efficiency was poor. This was attributed to damage initiating in the UD/CSM material interface, as a result of poor interlaminar mechanical properties, exacerbated by the large stress discontinuities at the adhesive/surface veil/CM and CM/UD interfaces. The failure essentially results in a detachment of the surface of the pultruded material. To identify a means of increasing the joint efficiency it is necessary to establish the stress distribution in the joint particularly at the interfacial layers in the pultruded material to define how the load is carried and transferred to each layer. To do this an experimental technique known as thermoelastic stress analysis (TSA) is used. TSA is a non-contact technique that provides a full field map of the stresses on the surface of a component. The application of TSA to composite materials is described in the paper. To obtain quantitative stress data from TSA it is necessary to ‘calibrate’ the materials; the calibration approach is also described in the paper. The TSA data provides a layer-by-layer map of the stresses from the joint interface on the surface through the complex mat layer into the UD. This approach has provided a new insight into pultruded joint behaviour and enabled improved validation of Finite Element Analysis (FEA) ...|$|E
40|$|Thermoelastic Stress Analysis (TSA) and Digital Image Correlation (DIC) {{are used}} to examine the stress and strain {{distributions}} around the geometric discontinuity in a composite double <b>butt</b> <b>strap</b> joint (DBSJ). A well-known major limitation in conducting analysis using TSA is that it provides a metric that is only related to the sum of the principal stresses and cannot provide the component stresses/strains. The stress metric is related to the thermoelastic response by a combination of material properties known as the thermoelastic constant (coefficient of thermal expansion divided by density and specific heat). The thermoelastic constant is usually obtained by a calibration process. For calibration purposes when using orthotropic materials it is necessary to obtain the thermoelastic constant in the principal material directions, as the principal stress directions for a general structure are unknown. Often it is assumed that the principal stress directions are coincident with the principal material directions. Clearly, this assumption is not valid in complex stress systems and therefore a means of obtaining the thermoelastic constants in the principal stress directions is required. Such a region is that in the neighbourhood of the discontinuities in a bonded lap joint. A methodology is presented which employs a point wise manipulation of the thermoelastic constants from the material directions to the principal stress directions using full field DIC strain data obtained from the neighbourhood of the discontinuity. A comparison of stress metrics generated from the TSA and DIC data is conducted to provide an independent experimental validation of the 2 D DIC analysis. The accuracy of a 2 D plane strain finite element model representing the joint is assessed against the two experimental data sets. Excellent agreement is found between the experimental and numerical results apart from in the adhesive layer; the adhesive is the only component of the joint where the material properties were not obtained experimentally. The reason for the discrepancy is discussed in the pape...|$|E
