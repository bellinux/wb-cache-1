50|$|There {{is also a}} term <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> cutter, {{which refers}} to a cutter having a corner radius that is fairly large, {{although}} less than the spherical radius (half the cutter diameter) of a ball mill; for example, a 20-mm diameter cutter with a 2-mm radius corner. This usage {{is analogous to the}} term <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> center referring to lathe centers with truncated cones; in both cases, the silhouette is essentially a rectangle with its corners truncated (by either a chamfer or radius Don).|$|E

50|$|The 1892 core has a hipped skillion roof, clad with {{galvanised}} iron. Small <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> roofs {{extend from}} the main roof along the exercise yard walls. Earth closets, once located under these extensions, have been removed. Two ornate finials ventilate the roof and indicate the cell spaces. The 1895/99 addition has a pitched roof which was extended over the modern addition. Three smaller finials are located on the ridge of this roof.|$|E
50|$|The {{main roof}} is hipped {{and covered with}} painted {{corrugated}} iron. This has been continued over the masonry extension to the south.

At the rear the veranda roof, although enclosed is still legible and consists of convex curved corrugated iron.|$|E
50|$|End mills (middle row in image) {{are those}} tools which have cutting teeth at one end, {{as well as}} on the sides. The words end mill are {{generally}} used to refer to flat bottomed cutters, but also include rounded cutters (referred to as ball nosed) and radiused cutters (referred to as <b>bull</b> <b>nose,</b> or torus). They are usually made from high speed steel or cemented carbide, and have one or more flutes. They are the most common tool used in a vertical mill.|$|E

East of the Alcohol Still House is a small brick latrine, with <b>bull</b> <b>nosed</b> corners, that is now used for chemical storage.|$|R
50|$|A {{nose ring}} is a ring made of metal {{designed}} to be installed through the nasal septum of domestic cattle, usually <b>bulls.</b> <b>Nose</b> rings are often required for bulls when exhibited at agricultural shows. There also is a clip-on ring design used for controlling other cattle for showing or handling. Nose rings are also used to prevent pigs rooting, and to encourage the weaning of young calves and other livestock by discouraging them from suckling.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bull</b> <b>nosed</b> {{verandah}} awning of Oonooraba {{is supported}} on turned columns with curved brackets, paired toward the principal {{entrance of the}} house. Above the columns are frieze panels, comprising diagonal latticework flanking a central section of vertical battening. The verandah balustrades which are replacements of a cast iron balustrade, are of vertical timber battening with decorative cutouts in regularly spaced battens. Many early lattice screens and timber louvres survive in the verandah openings.|$|R
50|$|The corner {{building}} is a two storey Federation Filigree style structure. The highly decorative parapet has five large pediments featuring stilted arches with columns and decorative stucco along with balustrade and columns. The {{corner of the building}} parapet has the remains of a dome inscribed with the name The P&O Hotel in decorative stucco. The top of the dome has been removed. Both storeys feature large multi-paned windows with stucco architraves. The High Street and Mouat Street frontage features a <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> veranda with extensive iron lacework and a truncated corner main entrance.|$|E
50|$|A pipe center, {{also known}} as a <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> center is a type of live center which has a large {{diameter}} conical nose rather than a sharp point. This allows the center {{to be used in the}} bore of a pipe or other workpiece with a large interior diameter. While a pipe center ensures the workpiece remains concentric, its main advantage is that it supports the workpiece securely, and can be used for parts whose larger inner diameter opprevents the use of a normal pointed center. Thin-walled material such as pipes easily collapses if excessive force is used at the chuck end.|$|E

The Pakenham Street {{side of the building}} features extensive stained glass lead lights in the windows where Oceanic Hotel name appears in the glass.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the event}} started, the <b>bull's</b> <b>nose</b> was blown full of pepper to enrage the animal before the baiting. The bull was often {{placed in a}} hole in the ground. A variant of bull-baiting was [...] "pinning the bull", where specially-trained dogs would set upon the bull one at a time, a {{successful}} attack resulting in the dog fastening his teeth strongly in the bull's snout. The bulldog was bred especially for this sport.|$|R
25|$|When bullbaiting {{became popular}} in England {{due to the}} {{shortage}} of bears, bull baiters soon realized that large fighting dogs were built too heavy and too slow {{for this type of}} combat. When fighting a bull, dogs were trained to grab onto the <b>bull's</b> <b>nose</b> and pin the bull's head to the ground. If the dog failed to do this, the bull would fling the dog out of the ring with its horns. The British therefore decided to selectively breed fighting dogs for shorter legs and a more powerful jaw. These efforts resulted in the Old English Bulldog.|$|R

5000|$|Gyromitra gigas, {{commonly}} known as the snow morel, snow false morel, calf brain, or <b>bull</b> <b>nose,</b> is a fungus {{and a member of the}} Ascomycota. G. gigas is found in Europe, western North America where it is common in mountainous areas in coniferous forests, and eastern North America where it is found with both conifers and hardwoods. [...] It is referred to as one of the false morels, due to its similar appearance and occurrence in the spring and early summer in similar habitats to true morels (Morchella ssp.). It is edible if properly prepared but should be avoided due to variability and similarity to other more toxic species of Gyromitra.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} study the {{influence}} of end mill tool geometries toward machining performances. In this project, two type of end mill tool have been used which are ball nose end mill and <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> end mill and two type of tool path have been selected which are one way next and zigzag tool path {{in order to determine}} the effects of both tool and tool path toward machining performances of surface roughness and machining time. The cutting parameter in this project are spindle speed, feed rate and depth of cut. The machine used in this project is Makino KE 55 CNC milling machine. The impact of end mill tool geometry on the surface roughness was determined by the testing the workpiece using Surface Roughness Tester. The machining time was determined by the CATIA V 5 software and by the real machining time. Measurement of surface roughness has indicated that the <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> end mill gives lower surface roughness compare to ball nose end mill when machine an incline surface. In other hand, ball nose end mill give lower surface roughness for free form surface. For machining time, the real machining time is longer than the machining time by the CATIA. The machining data has indicated that ball nose has longer machining time compare to <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> end mill for machining time of incline and free form surface. In term of tool path, for incline surface zigzag tool path gives better surface than one way tool path and for free form surface one way gives better surface roughness compare to zigzag tool path. This project would help engineer to select the best end mill tool geometry and tool path strategy...|$|E
40|$|Invention {{of oxygen}} {{cylinder}} {{was one of}} the most important developments in the field of medical practice. Oxygen and other gases were compressed and stored at high pressure in seamless containers constructed from hand-forged steel in 1880. Materials technology has continued to evolve and now medical gas cylinders are generally made of steel alloys or aluminum. The filling pressure as well as capacity has increased considerably while at the same time the weight of cylinders has reduced. Today oxygen cylinder of equivalent size holds a third more oxygen but weighs about 20 kg less. The cylinders are of varying sizes and are color coded. They are tested at regular intervals by the manufacturer using hydraulic, impact, and tensile tests. The top end of the cylinder is fitted with a valve with a variety of number and markings stamped on it. Common valve types include: Pin index valve, <b>bull</b> <b>nose,</b> hand wheel and integral valve. The type of valve varies with cylinder size. Small cylinders have a pin index valve while large have a <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> type. Safety features in the cylinder are: Color coding, pin index, pressure relief device, Bodok seal, and label attached etc., Safety rules and guidelines must be followed during storage, installation and use of cylinders to ensure safety of patients, hospital personnel and the environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{common problem}} in the {{aeronautical}} industry is the chatter vibration {{due to the lack}} of dynamic stiffness in the milling of thin walls and thin floors. The present work proposes a method for chatter avoidance in the milling of flexible thin floors with a <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> end mill. It allows the calculation of the thickness previous to finish milling or the minimum dynamic stiffness that the floor must have to avoid the chatter vibration appearance. To obtain these values, the stability model algorithm has been inverted to estimate the thickness or the dynamic stiffness required in a floor to allow a stable milling. This methodology has been validated satisfactorily in several experimental tests...|$|E

Failed anchor rods made of AIS 309 SS were analyzed for chemical composition, hardness, tensile strength and microstructural condition. Sigma (s) phase induced embrittlement caused failure of anchor at the non-welded end. At the anchor-MS plate weld, poor quality of the weld was noted. Overheating from flue gas entry in the gaps caused by inadequate expansion joints resulted in damage to the backup insulation layers. At such high temperatures, the SS anchor-MS weld will have a lesser strength and weld failure occurred. Loss of anchor reinforcement resulted in falling of refractories...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} precise {{approach}} to the generation of optimized collision-free and gouging-free tool paths for 5 -axis CNC machining of freeform NURBS surfaces using flat-end and rounded-end (<b>bull</b> <b>nose)</b> tools having cylindrical shank. To achieve high approximation quality, we employ analysis of hyper-osculating circles (HOCs) (Wang et al., 1993 a,b), that have third order contact with the target surface, and lead to a locally collision-free configuration between the tool and the target surface. At locations where an HOC is not possible, we aim at a double tangential contact among the tool and the target surface, {{and use it as}} a bridge between the feasible HOC tool paths. We formulate all such possible two-contact configurations as systems of algebraic constraints and solve them. For all feasible HOCs and two-contact configurations, we perform a global optimization to find the tool path that maximizes the approximation quality of the machining, while being gouge-free and possibly satisfying constraints on the tool tilt and the tool acceleration. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach via several experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Mechanistic {{models of}} the milling process must {{calculate}} the chip geometry and the cutter edge contact length in order to predict milling forces accurately. This task becomes increasingly difficult for the machining of three dimensional parts using complex tool geometry, such as <b>bull</b> <b>nose</b> cutters. In this paper, a mechanistic model of the milling process based on an adaptive and local depth buffer of the computer graphics card is compared to a traditional simulation method. Results are compared using a 3 -axis wedge shaped cut – a tool path with a known chip geometry {{in order to accommodate}} the traditional method. Effects of cutter nose radius on the cutting and edge forces are considered. It is verified that there is little difference (1. 4 % at most) in the predicted force values of the two methods, thereby validating the adaptive depth buffer approach. The numerical simulations are also verified using experimental cutting tests of aluminum, and found to agree closely (within 12 %).

5000|$|The dog's goal in {{the attack}} was to pin and steadfastly {{hold on to the}} <b>bull's</b> <b>nose,</b> which is its most {{sensitive}} spot. If the dog gripped tightly, the bull became completely tractable. The practical purpose that pre-dated the sport was that the working [...] "butcher's dogs" [...] rendered the semi-wild cattle available to the butcher for slaughter without human injury. To avoid this attack, experienced fighting bulls lowered their heads as much as possible {{in the direction of the}} attacking dog, protecting their noses and meeting the attacker with only their horns, tossing the dog into the air. The dog reciprocated by staying low to the ground as it crept towards the bull. These tactics resulted in a specialized breed in the form of the now-extinct original Old English Bulldog.|$|R
40|$|Variety of helical {{end mill}} {{geometry}} {{is used in}} industry. Helical cylindrical, helical ball, taper helical ball, <b>bull</b> <b>nosed</b> and special purpose end mills are widely used in aerospace, automotive and die machining industry. While the geometry of each cutter may be different, the mechanics and dynamics of the milling process at each cutting edge point are common. This paper presents a generalized mathematical model of most helical end mills used in industry. The end mill geometry is modeled by helical flutes wrapped around a parametric envelope. The coordinates of a cutting edge point along the parametric helical flute are mathematically expressed. The chip thickness at each cutting point is evaluated by using the true kinematics of milling including the structural vibrations of both cutter and workpiece. By integrating the process along each cutting edge, which is {{in contact with the}} workpiece, the cutting forces, vibrations...|$|R
