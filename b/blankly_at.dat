500|$|Raven's cameo {{appearance}} {{was identified as}} one of the music video's highlights by Jjannise of Out and a writer from Queer Me Up. Jjannise of Out felt both repulsed and attracted by the image of Raven [...] "ainted like Raja's Leather Drag Barbie twin and gazing <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the camera". A writer for Queer Me Up wrote that Raven's inclusion turned the video into [...] "he ultimate Drag Queen Extrvaganza!", referencing him as [...] "the magnificent Raven".|$|E
500|$|Later, Scully {{is sitting}} by Mulder's bedside when he regains consciousness. He stares <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> Scully, and asks [...] "Who are you?" [...] At first, Scully thinks that Mulder does not {{remember}} her. However, she quickly {{realizes that he}} is actually playing a practical joke. They laugh, and Mulder asks, [...] "Did anybody miss me?" [...] Scully responds with tears. Later at the FBI, Kersh expresses his disappointment that Doggett did not take his advice to abandon Mulder's case and rescinds his offer to promote him. He indicates that {{he will continue to}} work on The X-Files with Scully and Mulder.|$|E
500|$|Duncan {{initially}} had difficulties {{adapting to}} the game he thought would help relieve his pain and frustration. Nancy Pomroy, the athletic director of the St. Croix Country Day School was quoted: [...] " [...] was so huge. So big and tall, but he was awfully awkward at the time." [...] He overcame this to become a standout for the St. Dunstan's Episcopal High School, averaging 25 points per game as a senior. His play {{attracted the attention of}} several universities, despite having only picked up the game in ninth grade. Wake Forest University basketball coach Dave Odom in particular grew interested in Duncan after the 16-year-old allegedly played NBA star Alonzo Mourning to a draw in a 5-on-5 pick-up game. Odom was searching for a tall, physical player to play near the basket. Given the weak level of basketball in the Virgin Islands, Odom was wary about Duncan at first, especially after first meeting him and thinking him to be inattentive; Duncan stared <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> Odom for most of the conversation. However, after the first talk, Odom understood that this was just Duncan's way of paying attention, and discovered that he was not only athletically talented, but also a quick learner. Eventually, despite scholarship offers by the University of Hartford, the University of Delaware and Providence College, Duncan joined Odom's Wake Forest Demon Deacons.|$|E
60|$|The rod {{dropped from}} the relaxed fingers of my under-study, and he stood <b>blankly</b> staring <b>at</b> me, and waiting for an explanation. I gave it.|$|R
60|$|He sat staring <b>blankly</b> out <b>at</b> the window, {{and taking}} his wife's hand between his own, pressed {{it as he}} had been wont to do in their old courting-days nearly forty years before.|$|R
60|$|<b>Blankly</b> James looked <b>at</b> John and John at James. This {{was very}} trying.|$|R
2500|$|The game's AI {{was often}} cited as another {{weakness}} of the game, with IGN listing glitches such as an enemy boss walking off a cliff and [...] "saving us the bother of having to defeat him in combat". Eurogamer stated that the player's allies were [...] "AI-impoverished", stepping into the player's line of fire [...] "before sauntering off unscathed and oblivious", while Game Informer said that the AI appears to be [...] "tripping on acid as they stare <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> walls and sunsets". The lack of mid-level saves or a checkpoint system was also quoted as a weakness, forcing the player to restart a level {{if they fail to}} complete an objective.|$|E
2500|$|Utilisation: Any {{utilisation}} {{leads to}} increasing trance depth. All utilisation should proceed as {{a continuation of}} extension of the initial procedure. Much can be done nonverbally; for example, if any subjects are just looking <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> me, I may slowly shift my gaze downward, causing them {{to look at their}} hand, which I touch and say [...] "look at this spot.". This intensifies the trance state. Then, whether the subjects are looking at you or at their hand or just staring blankly, you can use your left hand to touch their elevated right hand from above or the side - so long as you merely give the suggestion of downward movement. Occasionally a downward nudge or push is required. If a strong push or nudge is required, check for anaesthesia.|$|E
60|$|There was a pause, {{during which}} each looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the others.|$|E
60|$|He {{began to}} {{walk up and down}} the room, then he went into the dining-room, and stood staring <b>blankly</b> out <b>at</b> the cornfield. The table was already laid for lunch. Presently he turned, still dreaming, and almost {{mechanically}} helped himself to a glass of sherry.|$|R
6000|$|The {{two women}} looked <b>blankly,</b> despairingly, <b>at</b> each other. In the sunshine-flooded street {{one or two}} shabby idlers were pausing to eye the {{handsome}} equipage with its magnificent bay horses, and the two great ladies on the doorstep of the fencing-academy. From across the way came the raucous voice of an itinerant bellows-mender raised in the cry of his trade: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{cover of}} {{a recent issue of}} a leading Canadian {{magazine}} drew a comic parallel between the children of today and the children of' the parental generation. The children of the past were depicted as happy carefree lads and lassies engaging in such active games as hoop rolling, skipping, scrub baseball, apple stealing and the like. The modern child appeared in a darkened room <b>blankly</b> staring <b>at</b> a television screen. This idea appears too common now that television has become a part of life and it is not always expressed in a humourous vein. In fact many people are concerned about this new medium and the attraction it has for children...|$|R
60|$|Erskine {{sat down}} on the stairs and gazed <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the {{opposite}} wall.|$|E
60|$|He stared <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the humming blue gas jets {{amidst the}} {{incandescent}} asbestos for a space.|$|E
60|$|Brand {{took the}} sheet of unintelligible {{characters}} into his own hand. He looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> it.|$|E
50|$|Her white face, beautiful, unmarked by any flaw of skin or feature, stared <b>blankly</b> back <b>at</b> him. He fancied {{that she}} had cringed, her slim body {{pressing}} further into the wall behind her. He didn't speak. He had never known {{how to talk to}} women. There was only one thing he had ever been able to do to women and, advancing now, smiling, he did it. Then, when it was all over, he straightened her against the wall so that she would be ready to die for him again. It was the best thing in his life, just knowing she was there, waiting until the next time... But one day she wasn't there waiting...|$|R
6000|$|Charmian let {{the papers}} fall to her lap, {{and looked at}} Cornelia who stared <b>blankly,</b> helplessly back <b>at</b> her. [...] "What a hateful, spiteful little cad!" [...] she began, and she {{enlarged}} at length upon Mr. Dickerson's character and behavior. She arrested herself in this pleasure, and said, [...] "But I don't understand why Mr. Ludlow should have staid away this evening {{on account of his}} letter, or why he should have sent it to you, if he knew about it already. It seems to me----" ...|$|R
60|$|Both the Pigeoncotes {{had turned}} deadly pale. The mention of Dresden had thrown a sudden {{light on the}} situation. It was Wilfrid the Attache, a very {{superior}} young man, who rarely came within their social horizon, whom they had been entertaining unawares in the supposed character of Wilfrid the Snatcher. Lady Ernestine Pigeoncote, his mother, moved in circles which were entirely beyond their compass or ambitions, and the son would probably one day be an Ambassador. And they had rifled and despoiled his portmanteau! Husband and wife looked <b>blankly</b> and desperately <b>at</b> one another. It was Mrs. Peter who arrived first at an inspiration.|$|R
60|$|An hour {{went by and}} Tom roused up. He looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> Jack Wumble and Ike Furner.|$|E
60|$|Ann swung round, {{and gazed}} at her uncle in concern. He was staring <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the paper.|$|E
60|$|She stared <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> him, without replying, {{and they}} silently {{made their way}} to Mr. Gerald's carriage.|$|E
5000|$|Musically, [...] "Crimewave" [...] builds from now-retro electroclash to a {{clattering}} mix of drums. The song {{consists of}} simple, catchy beats backed by lively video game sounds. [...] "Crimewave" [...] was composed as breezy, off-kilter electropop. Paul Lester from The Guardian likened [...] "Crimewave" [...] {{to the sound}} of Ian Curtis from Joy Division intoning <b>blankly</b> over Kraftwerk <b>at</b> their most synthetic. The song consists only of the following lyrics which are repeated vocally by Health in monotone throughout the song: [...] "Eyes lit / On sharp threats / From dark lips / The lights press / The soft skin / To rough hands". [...] "Crimewave" [...] follows a chord progression of Em, C, Am, Bm, Em, C, G, Bm. [...] "Crimewave" [...] is set in the time signature of common time with an uptempo metronome of 121 beats per minute.|$|R
60|$|But at {{the next}} {{stopping}} places other passengers climbed into the carriage; and five complete strangers soon shared the grained wood box in which we were enclosed. There was a lady in black, with her hair smoothed up under her bonnet, and a long pale nose; and up against her sat her little boy, a fine fair, staring child of about five years of age. A black-clothed, fat little man with a rusty leather bag, over the lock of which he kept clasped his finger and thumb, quietly seated himself. He cast but one dark glance about him and immediately shut his eyes. In the corner was an older man with a beard under his chin, gaiters, and a hard, wide-brimmed hat. Besides these, there was a fat countrywoman {{on the same side}} as Pollie and I, whom I could hear breathing and could not see, and a dried-up, bird-eyed woman opposite in a check shawl, with heavy metal ear-rings dangling at her ears. She sat staring <b>blankly</b> and bleakly <b>at</b> things close as if they were at a distance.|$|R
60|$|For a {{long time}} O-Tar sat, his head sunk upon his breast, staring <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the floor.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Davis {{turned and}} looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> his friend. Mr. Wotton met his gaze with dilated eyes.|$|E
60|$|It was queer and for {{the moment}} the Rover boys and their uncle stared <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> one another.|$|E
60|$|Miss Aldclyffe looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the rector. 'Not Mr. Manston's wife--who {{else can}} she be?' she said simply.|$|E
60|$|Sherlock Holmes and I looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> each other, {{and then}} burst {{simultaneously}} into an uncontrollable fit of laughter.|$|E
60|$|The boy hunters looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> one another. All {{gazed up}} and down the shore and across the lake.|$|E
60|$|For {{an instant}} {{there was a}} dead silence in the bankers' offices. Charles Rush looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> his bookkeeper.|$|E
60|$|Lucy gazed <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> him. He {{began to}} shake, {{and his eyes}} grew wild. She rose from the log.|$|E
60|$|Hunterleys {{returned}} his greeting, a little <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> first. Then {{he remembered the}} young man {{and held out his}} hand.|$|E
60|$|She {{vanished}} {{the next}} moment, with a patter of bare feet, leaving Dane to stare <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the folded paper.|$|E
60|$|The cadets stared <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> each other. Only two of {{them were}} undressed; the others had all of their {{clothing}} on.|$|E
60|$|Swann hurried over to join Thesel. They looked <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> each other. The air {{might have}} been charged. Both girls showed alarm.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a note}} in French, in thin, flimsy foreign {{handwriting}} {{that the}} boy could not decipher. He stared <b>blankly</b> <b>at</b> the paper.|$|E
