5|$|In Judaism, it is {{recommended}} to have either a salty <b>bread</b> or to add salt to the <b>bread</b> if this <b>bread</b> is unsalted when doing Kiddush for Shabbat. It is customary to spread some salt over the <b>bread</b> or to dip the <b>bread</b> in a little salt when passing the <b>bread</b> around the table after the Kiddush. To preserve the covenant between their people and God, Jews dip the Sabbath <b>bread</b> in salt.|$|E
5|$|Acquacotta {{was invented}} in part {{as a means to}} make stale, {{hardened}} <b>bread</b> edible. People that worked away from home for significant periods of time, such as woodcutters and shepherds, would bring <b>bread</b> and other foods with them (such as pancetta and salt cod) to hold them over. Acquacotta was prepared and used to marinate the stale <b>bread,</b> thus softening it.|$|E

50|$|As wheat is {{the staple}} food of the state, <b>breads</b> are very significant. <b>Breads</b> are {{generally}} flat breads; {{only a few}} varieties are raised <b>breads.</b> The <b>breads</b> may be made {{of different types of}} flour and can be made in various ways. Popular <b>breads</b> include tandoori naan (naan baked in a tandoor), tandoori roti, kulcha, taftan, sheermal, millet (millet flour flatbread), and lachha paratha.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare textural (firmness) and sensory {{properties}} (surface colour, crumb colour, crumb texture, appearance, appearance and colour preferences) between whole <b>breads</b> made from conventional wheat (Triticum aestivum, L.) and whole <b>breads</b> made from unconventional wheat (Triticum aestivum, L., winter variety Skorpion, grains with blue aleuron). Wholemeal <b>breads</b> (control samples with marks C 1, C 2 and C 3) were prepared of 100, 90 and 80 % amount of conventional wholemeal wheat flour to 0, 10 and 20 % amount of smooth white flour made from conventional wheat using baker's experiment. Wholemeal <b>breads</b> (experimental samples with marks S 1, S 2 and S 3) were prepared of unconventional wholemeal wheat flour to smooth white wheat flour in same ratio as control samples of <b>breads.</b> Our results showed, that negative evaluation of some sensory attributes of <b>breads</b> made from unconventional wheat correlated with increasing addition of wholemeal flour of this wheat. It was found that <b>breads</b> made from conventional wheat (100, 90 and 80 % amount of conventional wholemeal flour) were more acceptable in surface colour, colour and appearance preferences than these sensory attributes of <b>breads</b> made from unconventional wheat (same amount of wholemeal flour). Appearance and crumb colour of <b>breads</b> made from conventional wheat (100 and 90 % amount of wholemeal flour) were evaluated better than these attributes of <b>breads</b> made from blue coloured wheat (same amount of wholemeal flour). Appearance and crumb colour of both groups of whole wheat <b>breads</b> (80 : 20) was similarly evaluated. Crumb texture of <b>breads</b> made from conventional wheat (90 % and 80 % amount of wholemeal flour) was worse than crumb texture of <b>breads</b> produced of same ratio of flour, but made from unconventional wheat. <b>Breads</b> with addition of 80 % of wholemeal flour milled of blue coloured wheat were most acceptable in all of sensory attributes for evaluators. Significant difference (p < 0. 05) of crumb fimness of <b>breads</b> were demonstrated between samples of <b>breads</b> (80 : 20) made from conventional or unconventional wheat. Crumbs of <b>breads</b> (100 : 0 and 80 : 20) made from blue coloured wheat had higher firmness than crumbs of <b>breads</b> (100 : 0 and 80 : 20) made from conventional wheat. But crumbs of <b>breads</b> (90 : 10) made from conventional wheat were firmer than crumbs of <b>breads</b> (90 : 10) made from unconventional wheat. <b>Breads</b> produced of blue coloured wheat were also more friable than <b>breads</b> made from conventional wheat. Although evaluation of wholemeal <b>breads</b> made from unconventional wheat had not better scores than evaluation of wholemeal <b>breads</b> made from conventioval wheat, but evalution of <b>breads</b> produced of unconventional wheat wholemeal flour were not below average and its market position could be very high in the future, due to the content of health benefit substances, which will be the subject of further research. <!

40|$|Chicken {{breasts were}} coated using <b>breading</b> of {{different}} particle size. <b>Breading</b> particle size {{was divided into}} small (particle size U. S. No. 20 sieve mesh size). Chicken breasts were battered, <b>breaded</b> and deep-fat fried for 240 sec. at an initial temperature of 160 oC.

5|$|A {{significant}} proportion of food waste is produced by the domestic household, which, in 2007, created 6,700,000 tonnes of food waste. Potatoes, <b>bread</b> slices and apples are respectively the most wasted foods by quantity, while salads are thrown away in the greatest proportion.

5|$|As {{far back}} as the Iron Age, Welsh folk were using wild cereals to create a coarse <b>bread.</b> By the time the Romans invaded, Celtic skills with <b>bread</b> had progressed to the point that white or brown breads could be produced.

Oat and barley breads were the main breads eaten in Wales up until the 19th century, with rye <b>bread</b> created for medicinal purposes.

The {{aim of this study}} was to improve the fatty acids (FA) profile of bakery products, producing <b>breads</b> with low saturated fatty acid (SFA) content and with high polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) content, through partial substitution of wheat flour by other ingredients (soy flour, flax flour, and wheat bran) and to analyze the effect of this change on the technological, rheological, and sensorial characteristics of <b>breads.</b> Flaxseed flour (FF), soybeans flour (SF), or wheat bran (WB) was used to replace 50, 100, and 150 [*]g[*]kg− 1 of wheat flour (WF) in <b>breads.</b> FF or SF produced a decrease in monounsaturated and SFA and an increase of PUFA in these <b>breads.</b> Furthermore, <b>breads</b> replaced with FF presented considerable increase in the content of n 3 FA, while, SF or WB contributed to rise of linoleic and oleic FA, respectively. The substitution percentage increase of FF, SF, or WB to formulation produced changes in the colour, rheological, textural, and technological characteristics of <b>breads.</b> This replacement resulted in improved lipid profile, being <b>breads</b> with 50 [*]g[*]kg− 1 SF, the better acceptance, baking features, and enhanced fatty acid profile...|$|R

50|$|It was {{not until}} the 18th century that it became common {{practice}} to make leavened rye <b>breads.</b> Sour dough was mostly used (older rye dough which had started to ferment). These <b>breads</b> were called pottbrauð (pot <b>breads)</b> because they were baked (or rather steamed) on a stove under a pot (upside down) - i.e. a kind of oven. Around 1900, it was common to bake these <b>breads</b> in sealed containers (i.e. from imported sweets, today often from milk cartons).
