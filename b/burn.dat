5|$|Burns {{that affect}} only the {{superficial}} skin layers {{are known as}} superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends {{into some of the}} underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree <b>burn.</b> Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree <b>burn,</b> the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the <b>burn</b> area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree <b>burn</b> additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The <b>burn</b> is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part.|$|E

5|$|The small burns {{that are}} tributaries to the East <b>Burn</b> {{contributed to the}} {{draining}} of the lands of Dunnikier Estate. The <b>burn</b> emerges from a deep-set culvert to flow under the Victoria Viaduct, down a deep gorge, through the site of Hutchison's Flour Mills before running parallel to the harbour wall and into the sea. From the mid-19th century, the Hutchison's buildings became a significant landmark adjacent to the <b>burn.</b> The flour millers chose this area for its railway connection which linked the main station to the harbour, rather than for the {{need to use the}} <b>burn</b> to power the mills. The West (or Tiel) <b>Burn,</b> was also important, providing power for textile mills. This <b>burn</b> flowed out of the Raith Estate lands where scenically and recreationally it was used to create Raith Lake (with its tributary, the Dronachy <b>Burn).</b> The mill owners in Linktown also made use of the <b>burn.</b>|$|E

5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires <b>burn</b> with the greatest intensity {{in the late afternoon}} and evening. Few fires <b>burn</b> more than , {{and the vast majority of}} fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they <b>burn</b> themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will <b>burn</b> out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E
