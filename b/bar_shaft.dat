40|$|LectureSince 2007, the hot-filament Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) {{technology}} for crystalline diamond thin-film coatings has {{found its way}} into the mechanical seal market to combat the problems of dry running, corrosion and abrasion. This new technology has proved successful in hundreds of pumping applications {{in a wide range of}} services and duties. The reliability and lifetime of mechanical seals are improved by using diamond-coated faces. One such application involved the sealing of large boiler feed and steam generator pumps in power plants. The duty conditions for the pump?s seals can be as high as pressures up to 580 psig (40 <b>bar),</b> <b>shaft</b> RPMs up to 6, 500 and temperatures up to 400 ?F (200 ?C). Consequently, the mechanical seal faces are highly loaded in a fluid with far less than ideal lubricating qualities. It is evident, therefore, that these applications are technologically challenging for mechanical seal manufacturers not only from a tribological perspective, but also from a corrosion viewpoint when the feed water has a low electrical conductivity or is free of impurities. This paper discusses a new seal-face treatment using hotfilament CVD manufacturing technology tested in a lab for 16, 000 hours and currently used in feed pump operations in several power stations in the USA and Europe...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. In {{the first}} paper, Alexandrov's Theorem was studied, and extended, {{to show that}} convex polyhedra form statically rigid {{frameworks}} in space, when built with plane-rigid faces. This second paper studies two modifications of these polyhedral frameworks: (i) block polyhedral frameworks, with some discs as open holes, other discs as space-rigid blocks, and the remaining faces plane-rigid; and (ii) extended polyhedral frameworks, with individually added <b>bars</b> (<b>shafts)</b> and selected edges removed. Inductive methods are developed to show the static rigidity of particular patterns of holes and blocks and of extensions, in general realizations of the polyhedron. The methods are based on proof techniques for Steinitz's Theorem, and a related coordinatization of the proper realizations of a 3 -connected spherical polyhedron. Sample results show that: (a) a single fc-gonal block and a fc-gonal hole yield static rigidity {{if and only if}} the block and hole are fc-connected in a vertex sense; and (b) a 4 -connected triangulated sphere, with one added bar, is a statically rigid circuit (removing any one bar leaves a minimal statically rigid framework) ...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{areas of}} consensus and disagreement among Dutch physiatrists concerning prescription of therapeutic footwear for the neuropathic foot {{and to develop}} a research agenda. Study Design and Setting: Forty participants were physiatrists and experts in the field of orthopedic shoe techniques. Four postal Delphi rounds were followed by a final plenary session. Results: Forty of the 44 invited experts participated in all postal Delphi rounds, with an overall response of 100 %. They achieved consensus on the following. 1. (Dutch) Terminology for two sets of domains and dimensions for the various features of the neuropathic foot and for the shoe characteristics. 2. Application of specific shoe components: insole, shaft, outsole, tongue, and heel. In most features of the neuropathic foot, shaft and outsole domains were linked in the flexibility dimension. 3. Shoe prescriptions for various features of the neuropathic foot in at least four technical domains. Experts disagreed on application of rocker <b>bar</b> and <b>shaft</b> height. In a final conference, 31 experts agreed on a prioritized research agenda. Conclusion: An intensive Delphi process yielded consensus on terminology, and determined areas of consensus and disagreement for future research for the various features of the neuropathic foot and the shoe characteristics. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|In a {{torsion spring}} the spring {{action is a}} result of the {{relationships}} between the torque applied in twisting the spring, the angle through which the torsion spring twists, and the modulus of elasticity of the spring material in shear. Torsion springs employed industrially have been strips, rods, or <b>bars,</b> generally termed <b>shafts,</b> capabable of being flexed by twisting their axes. They rely on the variations in shearing forces to furnish an internal restoring torque. In the torsion springs herein the restoring torque is external and therefore independent of the shearing modulus of elasticity of the torsion spring shaft. Also provided herein is a variable stiffness torsion spring. This torsion spring can be so adjusted as to have a given spring constant. Such variable stiffness torsion springs are extremely useful in gimballed payloads such as sensors, telescopes, and electronic devices on such platforms as a space shuttle or a space station...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{discriminate}} small changes for early fault diagnosis of rotating machines, condition monitoring {{demands that the}} measurement of instantaneous angular speed (IAS) of the machines be as accurate as possible. This paper develops the theoretical basis and practical implementation of IAS data acquisition and IAS estimation when noise influence is included. IAS data is modelled as a frequency modulated signal of which the signal-to-noise ratio can be improved by using a high-resolution encoder. From this signal model and analysis, optimal configurations for IAS data collection are addressed for high accuracy IAS measurement. Simultaneously, a method based on analytic signal concept and fast Fourier transform is also developed for efficient and accurate estimation of IAS. Finally, a fault diagnosis is carried out on an electric induction motor driving system using IAS measurement. The diagnosis results show that using a high-resolution encoder and a long data stream can achieve noise reduction by more than 10 dB in the frequency range of interest, validating the model and algorithm developed. Moreover, the results demonstrate that IAS measurement outperforms conventional vibration in diagnosis of incipient faults of motor rotor <b>bar</b> defects and <b>shaft</b> misalignment...|$|R

40|$|The study {{aimed at}} {{building}} a 3 -Dimensional finite element simulation to monitor orthogonal machining process under a dry machining environment. The {{study was conducted}} in two stages of experimentation and finite element modelling and simulation (FEMS). The purpose of the experimentation was to obtain data which will be used to validate the FEMS result. The FEMS was carried out with a commercially available solver. The workpiece material employed for the study was mild steel in the form of round <b>bar</b> of solid <b>shaft</b> having 45 mm diameter and length of 500 mm. Mild steel was selected due to its wide range of applications in the fields of manufacturing tools and mould industry. The tool material used was tungsten carbide of DIN 4980 R 20 mm x 20 mm, with cutting angle of 80 -degree tool steel, which was modelled in the FEMS as a rigid body. Various cutting conditions such as speed, feed rate and depth of cut were considered to obtain the tool chip temperature. Different values of temperature were recorded at interval of 10 seconds and ranged from 10 to 100 seconds. The FEMS was carried out by making one of the conditions vary while the others were constant. The temperature values measured with a digital thermocouple were used to validate the FEMS data obtained. The result show that the cutting temperature predicted by the FEMS is within 20 % of the real experimental value and followed the same trend. It was discovered that the values of temperature obtained from simulation were also much higher than that of experimentation. Therefore, the experimental value might not be accurate, due to some experimental errors and environmental effects like partial contact between the measuring device and the cutting tools, fluctuation in the magnitude of air flow around the surrounding which may affect the cutting temperature, room temperature and pressure effect. Generally, with an increase in the cutting speed, feed rate and depth of cut, the tool temperature also increased and the cutting speed was found to be the most effective parameter when consideration is given to temperature effects, especially in high range of cutting conditions...|$|R
