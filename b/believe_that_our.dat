25|$|Evolutionary {{biologists}} {{are skeptical}} of the claim that syntactic knowledge is transmitted in the human genome. However, many researchers claim {{that the ability to}} acquire such a complicated system is unique to the human species. Non-biologists also tend to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> ability to learn spoken language may have been developed through the evolutionary process and that the foundation for language may be passed down genetically. The ability to speak and understand human language requires speech production skills and abilities as well as multisensory integration of sensory processing abilities.|$|E

We <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> Lord Jesus Christ, in his same flesh, ascended {{above all}} visible heavens into the highest heaven, that is, the dwelling-place of God and the blessed ones, {{at the right}} hand of God the Father. Although it signifies an equal {{participation}} in glory and majesty, it is also taken {{to be a certain}} place about which the Lord, speaking in the Gospel, says: 'I go to prepare a place for you' (John 14:2). The apostle Peter also says: 'Heaven must receive Christ until the time of restoring all things' (Acts 3:21).|$|E

500|$|In 2012 Wilders {{was invited}} by the Q Society of Australia to visit Australia. In August 2012 {{he applied for}} a visa to give two speeches in October 2012. His staff and police {{protection}} officers were granted visas within three days, but Wilders was not. On 2 October 2012 Immigration Minister Chris Bowen, while stating that Wilders' views were offensive, stated {{that he would not}} block the visa application. Bowen stated: [...] "I have decided not to intervene to deny him a visa because I <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> democracy is strong enough, our multiculturalism robust enough and our commitment to freedom of speech entrenched enough that our society can withstand the visit of a fringe commentator {{from the other side of}} the world".|$|E
500|$|McClellan's first {{military}} operations were {{to occupy the}} area of western Virginia that wanted {{to remain in the}} Union and subsequently became the state of West Virginia. He had received intelligence reports on May 26 that the critical Baltimore and Ohio Railroad bridges in that portion of the state were being burned. As he quickly implemented plans to invade the region, he triggered his first serious political controversy by proclaiming to the citizens there that his forces had no intentions of interfering with personal property—including slaves. [...] "Notwithstanding all that has been said by the traitors to induce you to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> advent among you will be signalized by interference with your slaves, understand one thing clearly—not only will we abstain from all such interference but we will on the contrary with an iron hand, crush any attempted insurrection on their part." [...] He quickly realized that he had overstepped his bounds and apologized by letter to President Lincoln. The controversy was not that his proclamation was diametrically opposed to the administration's policy at the time, but that he was so bold in stepping beyond his strictly military role.|$|E

Florida cyber crimes defense attorney David S. Seltzer wrote of this that [...] "I do not <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> child pornography laws were designed for these situations... A conviction for possession of child pornography in Florida draws up {{to five years in prison}} for each picture or video, plus a lifelong requirement to register as a sex offender." ...|$|E

He maintained that [...] "{{there was never any}} easing up in his tour matches with Ellsworth Vines and Bill Tilden since there was the title of World Pro Champion at stake." [...] He said [...] "I must have played Vines in something like 350 matches, yet there was never any fixing as most people thought. There were always people willing to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> pro matches weren't strictly on the level, that they were just exhibitions.

2500|$|The {{fine-tuned}} Universe {{argument has}} also been criticized as an argument by lack of imagination, as it assumes no other forms of life, {{sometimes referred to as}} carbon chauvinism. Conceptually, alternative biochemistry or other forms of life are possible. Regarding this, Stenger argued: [...] "We have no reason to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> kind of carbon-based life is all that is possible. Furthermore, modern cosmology theorises that multiple universes may exist with different constants and laws of physics. So, {{it is not surprising that}} we live in the one suited for us. The Universe is not fine-tuned to life; life is fine-tuned to the Universe." ...|$|E
2500|$|Steiner {{and his men}} {{standing}} eyeball-to-eyeball with the 300 armed Italians, relayed to the Pentagon [...] "I am not worried about our situation. We have the firepower to prevail.

And I don't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> beef is with our ally, the Italians, but rather with the terrorists." [...] The American leadership in Washington concluded that while Steiner and his men could take the terrorists it was unlikely they would be able to get them out of Italy. By 4:00a.m. CET the next day, orders arrived for Steiner and his men to stand down.|$|E

50|$|It is <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>Our</b> Lady of Delights Grotto, {{in which}} St. Francis Xavier prayed, {{later became the}} church of Our Lady of Ransom. Our Lady of Ransom is the Patron of the {{congregation}} in Spain which redeemed the Christians from the Muslim invasion in the year 1218. The people of Kanniyakumari combined the name Ransom with Delight and call their patron Alangara Upakara Matha.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to {{the time}} of the debate between Calvinists and the Arminians at the Synod of Dort (1618-1619), the view in the early church appears to be on the side of {{conditional}} security. From his research of the writings of the early church fathers (AD 90-313), patristic scholar David W. Bercot arrived at this conclusion: [...] "Since the early Christians <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> continued faith and obedience are necessary for salvation, it naturally follows <b>that</b> they <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> a 'saved' person could still end up being lost." ...|$|R
5000|$|Although {{accustomed}} to many trials {{from an early}} age, and perhaps even because of those tribulations, Pierina {{was selected as the}} chosen visionary of Our Lady by becoming the faithful messenger of Mary the Mystical Rose (in Italian, [...] "Maria Rosa Mistica"). It was <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>Our</b> Lady the Mystical Rose expressed her Christian love by embracing the souls of all her human children, and by closely caressing, through the Immaculate Heart, those predilected souls in consecrated religious life.|$|R
2500|$|On October 29, 2009, {{following}} a disappointing 0–6 {{start to the}} season, Coach Fisher announced that Young would replace Collins as starter. [...] Titans owner Bud Adams had reportedly urged Fisher to give Young more playing time following the team's 59–0 loss to the New England Patriots on October 18, and became even more insistent during the team's bye week that followed. Fisher nonetheless withheld announcing the change [...] "for competitive reasons" [...] until the Thursday afternoon before the Titans' next game, on Sunday, November 1, against the Jacksonville Jaguars. Upon announcing the change, Fisher further stated: [...] "I'm still in Kerry Collins' corner because I don't <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> record {{is a reflection of}} the quarterback play," [...] Fisher said. [...] "It's a reflection of the team play. I'm still in his corner, but we've decided to go ahead and make this change." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 8 June, claims {{emerged that}} former Interior Minister and Alkatiri ally Rogerio Lobato (who had {{resigned}} a week earlier), acting on Alkatiri's instructions, recruited and armed a civilian militia to [...] "eliminate" [...] opponents of Alkatiri. The {{group consisted of}} about thirty civilians, and were allegedly armed with [...] "18 assault rifles, 6,000 round sic of ammunition, two vehicles and uniforms." [...] The leader of the group, referred to as Commander Railos, {{said that they had}} instructions to kill all of the rebel soldiers, but after losing five of the group in armed combat in Dili came to [...] "appreciate that the cost of arming civilians was bloodshed and deaths on all sides" [...] and was prepared to surrender to President Gusmão. Alkatiri strenuously denied the claims, saying that his government had not armed any civilians. Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta also said that he found it [...] "very hard to <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> own Prime Minister would... arm civilians".|$|E
2500|$|Phi Sig's {{value to}} other campuses was as an {{organization}} offering something special and valuable to persons of varying backgrounds. Massachusetts Agricultural − Aggie − was more egalitarian, open to men of average means but high potential, and not filled with the class-conscious scions of Boston and New York society. In many ways it has kept this ethic throughout its expansion. It never was simply another fraternity to be invited. Founder Brooks, four years {{before his death in}} 1938, put it this way: [...] "We <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> fraternity exerts a powerful influence for good in national college life. The thought which lay {{in the minds of the}} Founders was good. May our brothers never forget that the foundation for a useful and satisfying life must be thought -- thought resulting in the visualization of a high ideal; and the determination to use all of one's strength of body, mind and soul for its realization." ...|$|E
5000|$|After {{planning}} and development since 1996, this idea became the restaurant Ultraviolet, which opened in Shanghai in an undisclosed location in May 2012. The restaurant’s unique concept is based on Pairet’s theory of “psycho-taste” , or the psychology and emotions associated with food. He <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> perception of taste can be altered through engaging different senses and emotion triggers as we eat, and has {{been quoted as saying}} “Food is ultimately about emotion, and emotion goes beyond taste.” ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are many}} {{concerns}} that arise with dataveillance. Dataveillance assumes <b>that</b> <b>our</b> technologies and data are a true reflection of ourselves. This presents itself as a potential concern given {{that it can be}} <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> data is true to our own actions and behaviours [...] This becomes a critical concern when associated with the surveillance of criminal suspects and terrorist groups. Authorities who monitor these suspects would then assume that the data they have collected reflects their actions. This helps to understand potential or past threats for criminals as well.|$|R

30|$|Although {{the methods}} used to {{determine}} staffing levels in public health care systems vary significantly from country to country, The Faculty of Radiologists, RCSI, <b>believes</b> <b>that</b> <b>our</b> adaptation of the Australian model for workload calculation represents a useful tool applicable to any country’s hospital system.
