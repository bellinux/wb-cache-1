As {{reported}} <b>by</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun,</b> Governor Carroll and Mayor Latrobe were present at the station, along with B vice president King, General Herbert and his staff, and a number of police commissioners. Here they decided that conditions were too dangerous to send any troops away to Cumberland.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton {{described}} comets as {{compact and}} durable solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, ignited or heated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> Newton suspected that comets were {{the origin of}} the life-supporting component of air.|$|E
5|$|Karl von Frisch (1886–1982) {{studied the}} European honey bee, demonstrating that bees can {{recognize}} a desired compass direction {{in three different}} ways: <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun,</b> by the polarization pattern of the blue sky, and by the earth’s magnetic field. He showed that the sun is the preferred or main compass; the other mechanisms are used under cloudy skies or inside a dark beehive.|$|E

5|$|The Han-era Chinese {{discussed}} the illumination and shapes of heavenly bodies: were they flat and circular, {{or were they}} rounded and spherical? Jing Fang wrote in the 1st century BCE that Han astronomers believed the Sun, Moon, and planets were spherical like balls or crossbow bullets. He also wrote that the Moon and planets produce no light of their own, are viewable to people on Earth only because they are illuminated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> and those parts not illuminated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> would be dark on the other side. For this, Jing compared the Moon to a mirror illuminating light. In the 2nd century CE, Zhang Heng drew a similar comparison to Jing's by stating that the Sun is like fire and the Moon and planets are like water, since fire produces light and water reflects it. He also repeated Jing's comment that {{the side of the}} moon not illuminated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> was left in darkness. However, Zhang noted that sunlight did not always reach the Moon since the Earth obstructs the rays during a lunar eclipse. He also noted that a solar eclipse occurred when the Moon and Sun crossed paths to block sunlight from reaching earth.|$|E
5|$|The {{heliosphere}} is a stellar-wind bubble, {{a region}} of space dominated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> which radiates at roughly 400km/s its solar wind, a stream of charged particles, until it collides with the wind of the interstellar medium.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{resolution}} Voyager 2 images {{revealed a}} pronounced clumpiness in the arcs, with a typical separation between visible clumps of 0.1° to 0.2°, which corresponds to 100–200km along the ring. Because the clumps were not resolved, they {{may or may}} not include larger bodies, but are certainly associated with concentrations of microscopic dust as evidenced by their enhanced brightness when backlit <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|E

5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white dwarf star after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the coma}} and tail are {{illuminated}} <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> and may become visible when a comet {{passes through the}} inner Solar System, the dust reflects Sunlight directly while the gases glow from ionisation. Most comets are too faint to be visible {{without the aid of}} a telescope, but a few each decade become bright enough to be visible to the naked eye. Occasionally a comet may experience a huge and sudden outburst of gas and dust, during which the size of the coma greatly increases for a period of time. This happened in 2007 to Comet Holmes.|$|E
5|$|Conversely, DST can {{adversely}} affect farmers, parents of young children, and others whose hours are set <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> {{and they have}} traditionally opposed the practice, although some farmers are neutral. One reason why farmers oppose DST is that grain is best harvested after dew evaporates, so when field hands arrive and leave earlier in summer their labor is less valuable. Dairy farmers are another group who complain of the change. Their cows {{are sensitive to the}} timing of milking, so delivering milk earlier disrupts their systems. Today some farmers' groups are in favor of DST.|$|E

5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in his invention of the cloud chamber, used to detect ionising radiation.|$|E
5|$|Interplanetary space {{contains}} {{the magnetic field}} generated <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> There are also magnetospheres generated by planets such as Jupiter, Saturn, Mercury and the Earth that have their own magnetic fields. These are shaped by {{the influence of the}} solar wind into the approximation of a teardrop shape, with the long tail extending outward behind the planet. These magnetic fields can trap particles from the solar wind and other sources, creating belts of magnetic particles such as the Van Allen radiation belt. Planets without magnetic fields, such as Mars, have their atmospheres gradually eroded by the solar wind.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter's {{internal}} {{magnetic field}} prevents the solar wind, {{a stream of}} ionized particles emitted <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> from interacting directly with its atmosphere, and instead diverts {{it away from the}} planet, effectively creating a cavity in the solar wind flow, called a magnetosphere, composed of a plasma {{different from that of the}} solar wind. The Jovian (i.e. pertaining to Jupiter) magnetosphere is so large that the Sun and its visible corona would fit inside it with room to spare. If one could see it from Earth, it would appear five times larger than the full moon in the sky despite being nearly 1700 times farther away.|$|E
