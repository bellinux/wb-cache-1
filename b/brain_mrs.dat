40|$|Corticosteroids play {{extremely}} {{important roles in}} fear and anxiety. The mechanisms by which corticosteroids exert their effects on behavior are often indirect, because, although corticosteroids do not regulate behavior, they induce chemical changes in particular sets of neurons making certain behavioral outcomes more likely in certain contexts {{as a result of}} the strengthening or weakening of particular neural pathways. The timing of corticosteroid increase (before, during or after exposure to a stressor) determines whether and how behavior is affected. The present review shows that different aspects of fear and anxiety are affected differentially by the occupation of the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) at different phases of the stress response. Corticosteroids, at low circulating levels, exert a permissive action via <b>brain</b> <b>MRs</b> on the mediation of acute freezing behavior and acute fear-related plus-maze behavior. Corticosteroids, at high circulating levels, enhance acquisition, conditioning and consolidation of an inescapable stressful experience via GR-mechanisms. Brain GR-occupation also promotes processes underlying fear potentiation. Fear potentiation can be seen as an adjustment in anticipation of changing demands. However, such feed-forward regulation may be particularly vulnerable to dysfunction. MR and/or GR mechansisms are involved in fear extinction. <b>Brain</b> <b>MRs</b> may be involved in the extinction of passive avoidance, and GRs may be involved in mediating the extinction of active avoidance. In the developing brain, corticosteroids play a facilitatory role in the ontogeny of freezing behavior, probably via GRs in the dorsal hippocampus, and their influence on the development of the septo-hippocampal cholinergic system. Corticosteroids can exert maladaptive rather than adaptive effects when their actions via MRs and GRs are chronically unbalanced due to chronic stress. Both mental health of humans and animal welfare is likely to be seriously threatened after psychosocial stress, prolonged stress, prenatal stress or postnatal stress, especially when maternal care or social support is absent, because these can chronically dysregulate the central MR/GR balance. In such circumstances the normally adaptive corticosteroid responses can become maladaptive. Copyrigh...|$|E

40|$|AbstractProton {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) has been widely applied in human studies. There is now a large literature describing findings of <b>brain</b> <b>MRS</b> studies with mental disorder patients including schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and anxiety disorders.

Here we proposed the new theory of neuron-glia integrity to explain the findings of brain 1 H-MRS stuies. It proposed the neurochemical correlates of neuron-astrocyte integrity and axon-myelin integrity on the basis of update of neurobiological knowledge about neuron-glia communication and of experimental MRS evidence for impairments in neuron-glia integrity from the authors and the other investigators. Following the neuron-glia integrity theories, this review collected evidence showing that glutamate/glutamine change is a good marker for impaired neuron-astrocyte integrity and that changes in N-acetylaspartate and lipid precursors reflect impaired myelination. Moreover, this new theory enables us to explain the differences between MRS findings in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders...|$|E

Aim of the work: To evaluate the role of brain MR spectroscopy in the assessment of suspected mitochondrial diseases in the pediatric age group. Patients and methods: Thirty children with suspected mitochondrial diseases were examined by MRS. Examination was done using multisection technique and multiple echo times mainly short (35  ms) and intermediate (144  ms). Mitochondrial disease criteria scoring system was used to confirm the suspected diagnosis. Results: All patients showed elevated lactate peak with the CSF being the most sensitive (100 %).

40|$|SummaryStress {{exposure}} activates the HPA-axis {{and results}} in the release of corticosteroids which bind to two receptor types in the brain: the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). While {{the role of the}} GR in stress reactivity has been extensively studied, the MR has received less attention. Nevertheless, pioneering in-depth studies {{over the past two decades}} have shown the importance of the brain MR in the processing of stressful information. Moreover, a membrane-bound MR mediating the rapid effects of cortisol was recently discovered. This review summarizes how the MR may play a role in stress resilience. Both preclinical and clinical studies suggest that the MR is an important stress modulator and influences basal as well as stress-induced HPA-axis activity, stress appraisal, and fear-related memories. These MR effects are mediated by both genomic and non-genomic MRs and appear to be at least partially sex-dependent. Moreover, the majority of studies indicate that high MR functionality or expression may confer resilience to traumatic stress. This has direct clinical implications. First, increasing activity or expression of <b>brain</b> <b>MRs</b> may prevent or reverse symptoms of stress-related depression. Second, individuals with a relatively low MR functionality may possess an increased stress susceptibility for depression. Nevertheless, the number of clinical MR studies is currently limited.

Results: A developmentally normal 10 -month-old male presented with explosive onset of continuous spasms (without impairment in consciousness), refractory to multiple antiepileptic medications. Five-day video–electroencephalogram monitoring showed mild background slowing without epileptiform discharges (video 1). Cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis (49 /cmm) and increased protein (510 mg/L) with normal lactates and serial <b>brain</b> MRI/ <b>MRS</b> suggested a viral or immune-mediated encephalopathy. NMDA/VGKC antibodies were negative; enterovirus was isolated in CSF and stools. The explosive onset, subtle fall-off in head growth from birth (9 th to below the 0. 4 th percentile) and elevated cerebrospinal fluid protein prompted POLG 1 testing which showed compound heterozygosity for two known pathogenic mutations (A 467 T/T 914 P).

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) is {{a well-known}} non-invasive technique that provides spectra (by MR spectroscopy, MRS) and images (by magnetic resonance imaging, MRI) of the examined tissue with detailed metabolic, structural, and functional information. This doctoral work is focused on advanced methodologies and applications of MRS for probing cellular and molecular changes in vivo. A single-voxel diffusion-weighted (DW) MRS method was first developed for monitoring the size changes of intramyocellular lipid droplets in vivo. This DWMRS technique was then utilized for exploring the vascular origins of the functional blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signal. Magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) enables simultaneous MRS acquisition in multiple voxels. However, MRSI is conventionally time-consuming. Therefore, a compressed sensing (CS) method was proposed in this thesis to accelerate the acquisition speed of the in vivo MRSI. It holds the potential for promoting the realization of multiple-voxel DW-MRS experiments, though the latter is still constrained by hardware in the present. The single-voxel DW-MRS method for probing lipid diffusion was first developed and evaluated in oil and muscle phantoms. The experimental sequence was demonstrated {{to be sensitive to}} diffusion restriction and free of significant artifacts. Experiments were then performed in rat hindlimb muscles in vivo. The restricted lipid diffusion behavior was characterized by apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) changes and utilized for quantifying the sizes of intramyocellular lipid (IMCL) droplets in normal, fasting, diabetic and obese rats. The sizes of IMCL droplets reflect their vital roles in muscle energy metabolism. The IMCL droplet size estimated by ADC here was closely correlated with that measured by transmission electron microscopy. IMCL ADC was sensitive to metabolic alterations, decreasing in the fasting and diabetic groups while increasing in the obese group. These results clearly demonstrate DW MRS as a new means to examine the dynamics of IMCL metabolism in vivo. The DW-MRS technique was then utilized to characterize water ADC during neuronal activation to explore the vascular origins of the BOLD signal in rat <b>brains.</b> <b>MRS</b> experiments with acoustic stimulation were performed with a dynamic point-resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) acquisition on conditions with or without the diffusion gradient for blood suppression in the same voxel and same experimental session, which enabled the simultaneous T 2 /T 2 */diffusion measurements. The T 2 *% changes with and without diffusion gradient showed no significant difference, while the spin echo (SE) -BOLD% (T 2 %) change significantly decreased after applying the diffusion gradient, suggesting an intravascular component in the SE-BOLD signal. This intravascular component was not venous blood, as the T 2 * of this component was comparable with the T 2 * of the brain tissue. These results provide new insights into the vascular origins of BOLD signals. A CS approach was developed to accelerate in vivo magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) which enables multi-voxel MRS measurements. The CS undersampling was performed by acquiring a pseudo-random and density-varying subset of phase encodings. The proposed CS approach preserved the spectral and spatial resolution, while substantially reduced the number of phase encodings with accelerations up to seven fold for phantom and up to six fold for in vivo rat brains. published_or_final_versionElectrical and Electronic EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|Stress {{exposure}} activates the HPA-axis {{and results}} in the release of corticosteroids which bind to two receptor types in the brain: the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). While {{the role of the}} GR in stress reactivity has been extensively studied, the MR has received less attention. Nevertheless, pioneering in-depth studies {{over the past two decades}} have shown the importance of the brain MR in the processing of stressful information. Moreover, a membrane-bound MR mediating the rapid effects of cortisol was recently discovered. This review summarizes how the MR may play a role in stress resilience. Both preclinical and clinical studies suggest that the MR is an important stress modulator and influences basal as well as stress-induced HPA-axis activity, stress appraisal, and fear-related memories. These MR effects are mediated by both genomic and non-genomic MRs and appear to be at least partially sex-dependent. Moreover, the majority of studies indicate that high MR functionality or expression may confer resilience to traumatic stress. This has direct clinical implications. First, increasing activity or expression of <b>brain</b> <b>MRs</b> may prevent or reverse symptoms of stress-related depression. Second, individuals with a relatively low MR functionality may possess an increased stress susceptibility for depression. Nevertheless, the number of clinical MR studies is currently limited. In conclusion, the recent emergence of the MR as a putative stress resilience factor is important and may open up new avenues for the prevention and treatment of psychiatric disorders.

40|$|Background: Arginine:glycineamidinotransferase (AGAT/GATM) {{deficiency}} {{has been}} described in 9 patients across 4 families. Here we describe the clinical outcome and response to creatine supplementation in a patient of the second family affected with AGAT deficiency-a 9 -year-old girl. Patient and methods: Delayed motor milestones were noticed from 4. months of age and at 14. months moderate hypotonia, developmental delay and failure to thrive. Laboratory studies revealed low plasma creatine as well as extremely low levels of guanidinoacetic acid in urine and plasma. Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the brain showed absence of creatine. DNA sequence analysis revealed a homozygous mutation (c. 484 + 1 G > T) in the AGAT/GATM gene. AGAT activity was not detectable in lymphoblasts and RNA analysis revealed a truncated mRNA (r. 289 _ 484 del 196) that is degraded via Nonsense Mediated Decay. At 16. months, Bayley's Infant Development Scale (BIDS) showed functioning at 43 % of chronologic age. Oral creatine supplementation (up to 800. mg/kg/day) was begun. Results: At age 9. years she demonstrated advanced academic performance. Partial recovery of cerebral creatine levels was demonstrated on MRS at 25. months of age. <b>Brain</b> <b>MRS</b> at 40. months of age revealed a creatine/NAA ratio of about 80 % of that in age-matched controls. Conclusions: 8. years post initiation of oral creatine supplementation, patient demonstrates superior nonverbal and academic abilities, with average verbal skills. We emphasize that early diagnosis combined with early treatment onset of AGAT deficiency may lead to improvement of developmental outcome. © 2012 Elsevier Inc...|$|E
40|$|After {{more than}} 10 years of use, {{clinical}} neuroimaging spectroscopy {{has proven to}} be invaluable in the MRI assessment of several brain diseases. The metabolic characterization of diverse brain lesions and pathological conditions is well established by spectroscopy studies at 1. 5 T, but recently, {{an increase in the number}} of 3 T magnets has noticeably improved routine neuroimaging in general. For brain proton spectroscopy, the use of higher magnetic fields has been promising in terms of increasing the signal/noise ratio across the spectrum and widening the frequency bandwidth to allow clearer separation of peaks that are otherwise too close to each other at 1. 5 T, especially glutamate, glutamine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The individual detection and quantification of these metabolites will add more details to the characterization of brain diseases, and allow the inclusion of more brain pathologies. Moreover, the ongoing advances in dedicated hardware and integrated software have led to more accurate and automated postprocessing, offering neuroradiologists a more user-friendly interface. This is an up to date review of the main clinical applications of brain proton MR spectroscopy that are potentially improved at 3 T, taking into account the peculiarities of higher magnetic fields. It is based on both the literature and our own clinical experience, starting from July 2005 and including more than 250 scans at 3 T (unpublished material), and emphasizes, for every indication, a practical approach to <b>brain</b> <b>MRS</b> to achieve the optimal clinical impact. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

40|$|Abstract- A 36 -year-old {{man with}} staphylococcal {{meningitis}} had similar symptoms and MRI characteris-tics as reversible splenium lesion syndrome {{described in the}} literature-hyperdensity on DWI and T 2 WI/FLAIR, hypodensity on ADC, iso-intensity on T 1 WI, and no contrast enhancement on midline sple-nium. The splenium lesion on MRI disappeared as the symptoms improved. The etiology of staphylococcal meningitis was different from other reported cases, and the MRS study showed relatively elevated lactate and myo-inositol of splenium as compared to other selective regions in the brain (both white matter and gray matter), which implies increased anaerobic glycolysis and hyperosmolar state on the splenium. The ratios of NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr were abnormal in all selected regions, indicating that the patho-logic change involved the whole <b>brain.</b> More series <b>MRS</b> and other advanced exams to correlate intracranial environment (ex. cerebral blood flow, osmolality, inflammatory process, metabolites distribution, and neuro-transmitter changes) are needed to confirm the mechanisms of different etiologies with reversible splenium lesion syndrome...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} imaging (MRI) and {{magnetic resonance spectroscopy}} (MRS) have been investigated in a single neurodegenerative disease manifesting as either amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia (FTD) alone, but have not been examined in combined disorders such as ALS with FTD (ALS-FTD). To our knowledge, {{this study is the}} first attempt to demonstrate relationship between MRI abnormalities and MR spectroscopic metabolite changes of the motor cortex, frontal white matter and corticospinal tract in a patient with the diagnosis of ALS with probable upper motor neuron signs (ALS-PUMNS) and FTD. Patient presented underwent MRI of the <b>brain</b> and <b>MRS.</b> The ratio of N-acetylaspartate (NAA) to creatine (Cr), choline to Cr, myo-inositol (mI) to Cr and glutamate-glutamine (Glx) to Cr were derived from peak area measurement. Spectra from the right motor cortex, frontal white matter and corticospinal tract were obtained. MR images were evaluated for sulcus centralis enlargement, corticospinal tract hyperintensity and frontal lobes atrophy. Spectra showed reduced NAA/Cr and Glx/Cr ratio, yet the ratio of Cho/Cr exhibited significant elevation. MR images revealed sulcus centralis enlargement, high signal intensity of corticospinal tract and atrophy of both frontal lobes. Proton spectroscopic metabolic changes in a current patient fully correlate with previously reported MRS metabolic changes in ALS alone. Surprisingly, normal mI (glial marker) values have been found in almost all measured voxels of interest except in the frontal white matter. These findings differ from the previous findings in ALS or FTD alone. In conclusion, these findings support the concept that ALS, FTD and ALS-FTD may represent different manifestations of a single pathological continuum...|$|R
