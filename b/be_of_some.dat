5|$|Transvaginal {{ultrasound}} {{to examine}} the endometrial thickness in women with postmenopausal bleeding is increasingly being used {{to aid in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer in the United States. In the United Kingdom, both an endometrial biopsy and a transvaginal ultrasound used in conjunction are the standard of care for diagnosing endometrial cancer. The homogeneity of the tissue visible on transvaginal ultrasound can help to indicate whether the thickness is cancerous. Ultrasound findings alone are not conclusive in cases of endometrial cancer, so another screening method (for example endometrial biopsy) must be used in conjunction. Other imaging studies are of limited use. CT scans are used for preoperative imaging of tumors that appear advanced on physical exam or have a high-risk subtype (at high risk of metastasis). They {{can also be used to}} investigate extrapelvic disease. An MRI can <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> use in determining if the cancer has spread to the cervix or if it is an endocervical adenocarcinoma. MRI is also useful for examining the nearby lymph nodes.|$|E

25|$|Other authors {{speculate}} that turacos and other birds employing {{the use of}} turacoverdin may derive a physiological and biochemical benefit from synthesizing the pigment. Copper, like porphyrins, can be damaging to birds when accumulated at high concentrations.

25|$|The {{situation}} is not as simple if {{it is important that}} a background object, such as a sign, be unrecognizable. The magnification of background objects also increases with focal length, so with the technique just described, there is little change in the recognizability of background objects.-number will achieve both objectives, and that using a lens of different focal length will make no difference in the result. However, a lens of longer focal length may still <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> help; because of the narrower angle of view, a slight change of camera position may suffice to eliminate the distracting object from the field of view.|$|E

Spore forms of most pathogens are very tolerant of atmospheric ozone in concentrations where asthma patients start to have issues.|$|E

25|$|Occlusal splints (also termed dental guards) are {{commonly}} prescribed, mainly by dentists and dental specialists, {{as a treatment}} for bruxism. Proponents of their use claim many benefits, however when the evidence is critically examined in systematic reviews of the topic, it is reported that there is insufficient evidence to show that occlusal splints are effective for sleep bruxism. Furthermore, occlusal splints are probably ineffective for awake bruxism, since they tend to be worn only during sleep. However, occlusal splints may <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> benefit in reducing the tooth wear that may accompany bruxism, but by mechanically protecting the teeth rather than reducing the bruxing activity itself. In a minority of cases, sleep bruxism may be made worse by an occlusal splint. Some patients will periodically return with splints with holes worn through them, either because the bruxism is aggravated, or unaffected by the presence of the splint. When tooth-to-tooth contact is possible through the holes in a splint, it is offering no protection against tooth wear and needs to be replaced.|$|E
25|$|Frederick I of Prussia, Elector of Brandenburg {{and future}} King of Prussia, saw an {{immediate}} {{interest in what}} Huguenot Refugees could represent for his country. Indeed, he was both a francophile and an admirer of the French. In October 1685, he published the Edict of Potsdam granting the Huguenots everything the Edict of Fontainebleau refused them: safe passage to Brandenburg, freedom {{to live and work}} where they chose, religious freedom and the right to worship in their native French, tax exemptions for 10 years, and more, going as far as granting them the same rights as citizens of the states of Brandenburg-Prussia. Meanwhile, his envoy to King Louis XIV of France's court at Versailles, the Count of Schwerin, dispensed subsidies and passports to all who requested them, provided, of course, that those requesting appeared to <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> benefit to his sovereign. As a result, the Kingdom of Prussia became for many Huguenots, in particular for the noblesse militaire, the ideal place of refuge, for Jean de Forcade de Biaix.|$|E

United Nations Humanitarian Coordinator Robert Watkins praised Norgrove: [...] "She was a true advocate for the people of Afghanistan and was dedicated to bringing improvements to their lives", and [...] "her spirit and compassion will be greatly missed". First Minister of Scotland Alex Salmond said: [...] "Ms Norgrove was a dedicated aid worker who was doing everything she could to help people in Afghanistan—hopefully that legacy of service in a humanitarian cause can <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> comfort to her loved ones in their time of grief".|$|E
500|$|Although not a {{candidate}} herself, Bondfield campaigned for Labour {{in the general}} election of July 1945—a reporter found her instructing a meeting in Bury St Edmunds on the benefits of nationalisation. She was active in her local Labour Party, and continued to chair the Women's Group of Public Welfare until 1948. Her main task in these years was her autobiography, published in 1948 under the title A Life's Work. The purpose of the book, she wrote, was not to celebrate her own achievements, instead she hoped that her experiences [...] "may <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> service to the younger generation". The book had an indifferent reception; in The Observer, Harold Nicolson described it as [...] "ill composed and badly proportioned", with too much space devoted to inconsequential meetings while truly important events were hurried over. Nevertheless, he thought the book provided [...] "a fine example of resolute and in the end triumphant energy". The Manchester Guardians reviewer also criticised the work's confused structure and unselective detail, but found it [...] "a useful, direct and honest" [...] account of Labour's early years.|$|E
500|$|In {{the later}} months of 1759 Pownall {{wrote a letter}} to William Pitt {{requesting}} leave to return to England because [...] "I might <b>be</b> <b>of</b> <b>some</b> service" [...] there. [...] Biographer John Schutz speculates that the underlying reason for Pownall's request were related to frustration with his exclusion from the major military actions of the later war years, and possibly his desire to acquire a more significant post, such as a governor-generalship of conquered New France. [...] Historian Bernard Bailyn is of the opinion that Pownall's divisive dislike and distrust of Shirley supporters like Thomas Hutchinson and ensuing local political infighting contributed to the request, as did his difficult relationships with the military commanders. [...] Whatever the reason, the Board of Trade engaged in a reshuffling of colonial positions after King George II died, and Pownall was given the governorship of South Carolina, and permission to first take leave in England. [...] His departure from Boston was delayed by militia recruiting issues and the need to deal with the aftermath of a major fire in the city, and he did not leave until June 1760.|$|E
