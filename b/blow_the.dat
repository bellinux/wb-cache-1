5|$|After {{examining}} {{the practice of}} other British railways, Richard Maunsell, the Chief Mechanical Engineer, secured agreement for a 4-cylinder design, with an improved boiler and Belpaire firebox. The drive would be divided between the front coupled axle for the inside cylinders and the middle coupled axle for the outside cylinders giving better weight distribution and reduced hammer <b>blow.</b> <b>The</b> new design was an inevitable compromise between {{the need for additional}} power and to keep the weight down to an acceptable limit.|$|E
5|$|Eye {{irritation}} can {{be avoided}} by cutting onions under running water or submerged in a basin of water. Leaving the root end intact also reduces irritation as the onion base has a higher concentration of sulphur compounds {{than the rest of}} the bulb. Refrigerating the onions before use reduces the enzyme reaction rate and using a fan can <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> gas away from the eyes. The more often one chops onions, the less one experiences eye irritation.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base {{was closed}} by the Department of Defense, dealing Mobile's economy a severe <b>blow.</b> <b>The</b> closing {{resulted}} in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered {{in a period of}} economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.|$|E
50|$|The {{instrument}} is typically made {{of metal and}} is cylindrical. Inside the cylinder {{is a type of}} fan-blade which, when <b>the</b> performer <b>blows</b> through one end, spins and creates the sound. The faster <b>the</b> performer <b>blows,</b> <b>the</b> faster the fan-blade moves and the higher the pitch the instrument creates. Conversely, the slower <b>the</b> performer <b>blows,</b> <b>the</b> lower the pitch.|$|R

5|$|In 1980, Nancy Fink, a Brooklyn Law School professor, {{was elected}} as the congregation's first female president.

5|$|Jonathan <b>Blow,</b> <b>the</b> game's lead designer, {{desired to}} create a game around non-verbal communication, wanting players to learn from {{observation}} and to come to epiphanies in finding solutions and leading to {{a greater sense of}} involvement and accomplishment with each success. The game includes around 650 puzzles, though the player is not required to solve them all to finish the game.|$|E

5|$|Over the {{remaining}} {{months of the}} year the division carried out patrols of the rail and road networks, which were being mined. Some of the mines killed men from the division attempting to disarm them, until orders were issued to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> mines up rather than disarm them. Then on 2December a road mine killed four men from the 2nd Forward Observation Unit (Airborne).|$|E
5|$|Adolf Hitler summoned Lieutenant-General Kurt Student of the 7. Flieger-Division (7th Air Division) {{to discuss}} the assault. It was first {{suggested}} that a conventional parachute drop be made by airborne forces to seize and destroy the forts' guns before the land units approached. Such a suggestion was rejected as the Junkers Ju 52 transports were too slow and {{were likely to be}} vulnerable to Dutch and Belgian anti-aircraft guns. Other factors for its refusal were the weather conditions, which might <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> paratroopers away from the fort and disperse them too widely. A seven-second drop from a Ju 52 at minimum operational height led to a dispersion over 300metres alone.|$|E
5|$|Ambitious {{reporter}} Amy Harkin (Nancy McKeon) {{is stuck}} {{reporting on the}} heat wave while trying to find proof behind the scenes that Lexer and Midwest {{are responsible for the}} lack of sufficient power. The Secretary of Energy, Shirley Abbott (Dianne Wiest), is actively warning various politicians and the president that the power grid is too outdated to handle real natural disasters and that it is too vulnerable to attack. Dan London (Ari Cohen), the chief engineer of Lexer, has also repeatedly warned Lexer that their systems are too vulnerable to hackers, but the company is only interested in going with the cheapest options. He decides to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle on the company to Harkin, but as he refuses to appear on camera, Harkin's boss will not allow the piece to air.|$|E

After a few {{unlikely}} wins, the Kid calls for a break and confronts Shooter, who admits to being forced into cheating by Slade. The Kid insists he can win {{on his own and}} tells Shooter to deal straight or he will <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle, destroying Shooter's reputation. Before the game resumes, Melba succeeds in seducing the Kid. Christian makes a surprise visit to the room, catches them after the fact and walks out on The Kid.|$|E
5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas {{expansion}} ratio of nitrogen is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 2nd SS Panzer Division {{arrive with}} {{infantry}} and armor. Although they inflict heavy casualties on the Germans, {{most of the}} paratroopers, along with Jackson, Mellish, and Horvath are killed, while Upham avoids fighting. Miller attempts to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> bridge, but is shot and mortally wounded by Steamboat Willie, who has rejoined the Germans. Just before a Tiger tank reaches the bridge, an American P-51 Mustang flies overhead and destroys the tank, followed by American armored units which rout the remaining Germans. Witnessing Miller's shooting, Upham confronts Steamboat Willie and his group {{as they attempt to}} retreat. Steamboat Willie raises his hands in surrender, believing that Upham will accept because of their earlier encounter. Instead, Upham kills him, but lets the other Germans flee.|$|E

Despite {{disclaim}} of war, the knight issues a challenge: he will allow one man to strike him once with his axe, with the condition that he return the <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> next year. At first, Arthur accepts the challenge, but Gawain takes his place and decapitates the Green Knight, who retrieves his head, reattaches it and tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel at the stipulated time.|$|E
5|$|Minka, Didi, and Stu {{arrive in}} the attic to find the group enthralled {{by the end of}} Boris' story: Moses, cornered, calls down the power of God to part the Red Sea, which the Hebrews are approaching. They pass through the parted waters, which then crash back {{together}} behind them, engulfing the Pharaoh and her army. With the story over, the family gets up to finish the Seder only to see the wind <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> door shut, locking them all in. Boris decides to tell them another story, which Chas at first thinks is about how the Hebrews wandered the desert for forty years before finally reaching the Promised Land. Boris explains that it's actually a story about how an aunt and uncle of his met at Passover Seder back in Russia.|$|E
5|$|North American had {{originally}} suggested the hatch open outward and use explosive bolts to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> hatch {{in case of}} emergency, as had been done in Project Mercury. NASA did not agree, arguing the hatch could accidentally open, as it had on Grissom's Liberty Bell 7 flight, so the Manned Spacecraft Center designers rejected the explosive design {{in favor of a}} mechanically operated one for the Gemini and Apollo programs. Before the fire, the Apollo astronauts had recommended changing the design to an outward-opening hatch, and this was already slated for inclusion in the Block II Command Module design. According to Donald K. Slayton's testimony before the House investigation of the accident, this was based on ease of exit for spacewalks {{and at the end of}} flight, rather than for emergency exit.|$|E

5|$|Operation Polkovodets Rumyantsev was {{intended}} as the main Soviet offensive for 1943. Its aim was to destroy the 4th Panzer Army and Army Detachment Kempf, and cut off the extended southern portion of Army Group South. After the heavy losses sustained by the Voronezh Front, during Operation Citadel, the Soviets needed time to regroup and refit, delaying {{the start of the}} offensive until 3 August. Diversionary attacks, launched two weeks earlier across the Donets and Mius Rivers into the Donbass, drew the attention of German reserves and thinned the defending forces that would face the main <b>blow.</b> <b>The</b> offensive was initiated by the Voronezh Front and Steppe Fronts against the northern wing of Army Group South. They drove through the German positions, making broad and deep penetrations. By 5 August, the Soviets had liberated Belgorod.|$|E
5|$|Schiavo {{resigned}} from her {{position at the}} U.S. Department of Transportation in order to <b>blow</b> <b>the</b> whistle on what she saw as deficiencies in safety practices by the federal government's oversight of the airline industry. She was publicly critical of high-ranking U.S. aviation officials regarding the ValuJet Flight 592 passenger jet crash in the Florida Everglades {{which resulted in the}} deaths of all 110 people aboard. Schiavo appeared on ABC's Nightline program the night after the crash and was highly critical of FAA safety inspections methods. After resigning her position as Inspector General Schiavo taught courses at Ohio State University, and in April 1997 she joined the staff of Ohio State University in the position of Enarson Executive-in-Residence.|$|E
