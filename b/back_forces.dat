25|$|The second {{mechanism}} {{is a force}} imbalance at the calving front due to thinning causing a substantial non-linear response. In this case an imbalance of forces at the calving front propagates up-glacier. Thinning causes the glacier to be more buoyant, reducing frictional <b>back</b> <b>forces,</b> as the glacier becomes more afloat at the calving front. The reduced friction due to greater buoyancy allows {{for an increase in}} velocity. This is akin to letting off the emergency brake a bit. The reduced resistive force at the calving front is then propagated up-glacier via longitudinal extension because of the backforce reduction. For ice streaming sections of large outlet glaciers (in Antarctica as well) there is always water {{at the base of the}} glacier that helps lubricate the flow.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, further {{reinforcements}} {{and supplies}} were landed at Cape Torokina, and US Army forces began arriving {{to reinforce the}} Marines. In late December work on the airfields was complete and aerial bombing raids began against the Japanese base around Rabaul, while minelaying aircraft interdicted Japanese sea lanes of communication through the Buka Passage. Having initially held <b>back</b> <b>forces</b> to reinforce northern Bougainville, as the Japanese high command realized that the Cape Torokina lodgment was not a ruse, {{and would not be}} followed by a further assault on Buka, they slowly began moving troops from southern Bougainville, landing in small numbers around Empress Augusta Bay throughout late December. Meanwhile, several air attacks were launched on the US perimeter, while artillery was moved up and began shelling the perimeter from Hellzapoppin Ridge and Hill 600A. In late December, these features became the scene of further fighting as the 21st Marine Regiment was ordered to capture the Japanese positions. After this, there was a lull in the fighting on Bougainville as the Japanese decided to delay plans to launch a concerted counterattack, postponing the assault on Torokina until March 1944.|$|E

50|$|A 1998 study {{proposed}} that Ctenosauriscus was bipedal {{and that its}} elongated neural spines served to absorb the forces exerted from walking on two legs. Although limb bones are unknown, {{the study found that}} forces on the tips of the spines were focused on a point below the spinal column, hypothesized to be the knee joint. In the 2011 redescription of Ctenosauriscus, the authors rejected this idea because for forces on the spine to meet at the knee joint, muscles would have to form a direct connection between the knee and the <b>back.</b> <b>Forces</b> exerted from movement travel from the hind legs to the hip and sacral vertebrae, not the dorsal vertebrae. The sail of Ctenosauriscus would also have shifted its center of weight {{toward the front of the}} body, making bipedal locomotion difficult or impossible.|$|E
5000|$|Free body {{diagrams}} may {{not represent}} an entire physical body. Using {{what is known}} as a [...] "cut" [...] only portions of a body are selected for modeling. This technique exposes internal forces, making them external, therefore allowing analysis. This technique is often used several times, iteratively to peel <b>back</b> <b>forces</b> acting on a physical body. For example, a gymnast performing the iron cross: analyzing the ropes and the person lets you know the total force (body weight, neglecting rope weight, breezes, buoyancy, electrostatics, relativity, rotation of the earth, etc..). Then cut the person out and only show one rope. You get force direction. Then only look at the person, now you can get hand forces. Now only look at the arm to get the shoulder forces and moments, and on and on until the component you intend to analyze is exposed.|$|E

5000|$|Paramahamsa is a Sanskrit word {{translated}} as 'supreme swan'. The word is compounded of Sanskrit परम parama meaning 'supreme' or 'transcendent' (from PIE per meaning 'through', 'across', or 'beyond', cognate with English far) and Sanskrit हंस hamsa meaning 'swan or wild goose'. The prefix parama {{is the same}} element seen in Parameshwara, a title for God. Early English scholars of Indian language and religion may have mockingly translated hamsa as 'goose' in particular, because in English folklore a goose (the domesticated type) traditionally denotes foolishness and irresponsibility. But in Hindic tradition, wild geese, including swans, are noted for characteristics of discipline, stamina, grace, and beauty. This is especially said of the bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), whose migratory route from Central Asia to India and <b>back</b> <b>forces</b> it to fly over the Himalayas twice a year, a feat which makes {{it one of the}} highest flying birds in the world.|$|E
50|$|Under {{pressure}} from the American artillery, and armored troops, the German units of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division eventually fall back on a more limited basis, before shutting themselves in the fort, West of Metz during the final assault on the old city of Lorraine.

On the evening of November 23, 1944, shortly before midnight, the last detachments of the 379th Infantry Regiment withdraw from Moscou Farm, from the Farm St-Hubert, from the bunker south of Fort Guise and the Group Fortification Francois de Guise, leaving room for fresh troops of 5th Infantry Division. The Fort de Bois-la-Dame still held by a hundred men of the 462th Volks-Grenadier-Division, the Fort St Hubert and the Fort de Marival, each still manned by fifty men, will finally surrender, November 26, 1944.|$|E
40|$|Injuries from slips, {{falls and}} {{overexertion}} during ladder climbing activities {{are common in}} both occupational and non-occupational environments. Little is known, however, about the task, equipment, and user parameters which may cause these injuries. In order to evaluate the hazards associated with ladder climbing, ten male subjects were tested under combinations of ladder rung separation, ladder slant, climbing speed, and climbing direction. Hand and foot forces, hand torques, torso muscle EMGs and hand and foot locations on the ladder rungs were recorded. A biomechanical model was developed which allowed the evaluation of dynamic joint moments and <b>back</b> <b>forces.</b> Study results include safety and biomechanical design guidelines relating {{to the effect of}} the task, equipment, and user parameters on climbing safety. Under the conditions studied there {{does not appear to be}} a significant slip hazard for people with reasonable strength and mobility. There may be a potential for climber grip strength to be exceeded under some field conditions and foot slip is possible during the use of vertical ladders. There is also the potential for localized fatigue in muscles acting at the elbow, hip and ankle joints during long climbs. The relatively high measured torso muscle IEMG suggests that certain ladder climbing activities may generate considerable <b>back</b> <b>forces...</b>|$|E

The system consists of four robotic arms, which can be equipped with either minimally invasive instruments or a stereo camera.

We have utilized this system to assess the possibility of automating difficult handling tasks like surgical knot tying. In order to achieve this, a novel approach for human-machine skill transfer was developed. It constitutes an extension to learning by demonstration, which is a well known paradigm of robotic learning. Index Terms—learning by demonstration, skill transfer, robotic surgery I...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Draw beads {{are used}} in sheet metal forming {{processes}} to regulate material flow and achieve higher quality in the parts. The draw beads impose draw restraining force on the blank which eliminates defects such as wrinkling, tearing and reduces springback. In a draw-bend test, the draw restraining force is imitated by the back force applied through a hydraulic ram. As the back force increases, large strain is induced which reduces springback tendency. This study evaluates the influence of back force on the springback behavior in advanced high strength steel (AHSS). Three grades of dual-phase steel, namely DP 600, DP 800, DP 980, are used with normalized <b>back</b> <b>forces</b> ranging from 0. 5 to 1. 1. The springback decreases as the back force increases. Anticlastic curvature as well as curl radius has significant influence on the springback behavior of dual phase steels. [URL]...|$|E
