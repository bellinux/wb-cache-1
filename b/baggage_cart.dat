500|$|The {{hotel has}} a {{tradition}} of keeping a cat that has the run of the hotel. The practice dates to the 1930s, when Frank Case took in a stray male cat that was initially named [...] "Rusty." [...] Hotel lore says actor John Barrymore suggested the cat needed a more [...] "dignified" [...] name, so the cat was renamed [...] "Hamlet." [...] Nowadays, whenever the hotel has a male cat, he's named Hamlet; but if the hotel has a female cat, she's named [...] "Matilda." [...] The current Algonquin cat, a Matilda, is a Ragdoll that was named 2006 cat of the year at the Westchester (New York) Cat Show. [...] Visitors can spot Matilda on her personal chaise longue in the lobby; she can also be found in her favorite places: behind the computer on the front desk, or lounging on a <b>baggage</b> <b>cart.</b> The doormen feed her and the general manager's executive assistant answers Matilda's e-mail. During 2011, Matilda was temporarily confined to an upper floor or to the limits of a leash tethered to the check-in desk, due to a directive from the city Department of Health. As of late 2011, Matilda has been confined to the non-food areas of the lobby by an electronic pet fence.|$|E

50|$|Dollies for loose baggage {{are used}} for the {{transportation}} of loose baggages, oversized bags, mail bags, loose cargo carton boxes, etc. between the aircraft and the terminal or sorting facility. Dollies for loose baggage are fitted with a brake system which blocks the wheels from moving when the connecting rod is not attached to a tug. Most dollies for loose baggage are completely enclosed except for the sides which use plastic curtains to protect items from weather. In the US, these dollies are called <b>Baggage</b> <b>Cart,</b> but in Europe <b>Baggage</b> <b>Cart</b> means passenger baggage trolleys.|$|E
50|$|Mechanized baggage trains−trams, used at airport terminals, have {{steering}} mechanisms {{similar to}} those on longer trackless trains, although the tractor units are commonly designed to be frequently detached from the <b>baggage</b> <b>carts,</b> {{to be used for}} other purposes.

50|$|Cohen was {{the target}} of an attack by Frank Sinatra on Monday, September 11, 1967 after the singer's casino credit had been stopped on the orders of Howard Hughes, who had {{purchased}} the Sands earlier that year. Sinatra reportedly owed the hotel casino $200,000. Sinatra flew into a rage and walked out before a performance on Saturday, September 9. He yelled at the pit bosses, destroyed the furniture in his penthouse apartment, steered a <b>baggage</b> <b>cart</b> through a plate-glass window in the shopping arcade, and ripped wires out of the hotel switchboard before leaving. Sinatra then flew to Palm Springs and signed with Caesars Palace. He returned to the Sands {{in the early hours of}} Monday morning, demanding to speak to Cohen. At 5:45 a.m. having been awakened by an operator, Cohen agreed to come down and went to the coffee shop to have something to eat first. Sinatra confronted him there, unleashed a stream of curses and threats including, according to witnesses, an anti-Semitic slur, and upended the table laden with breakfast onto Cohen, spilling a potful of hot coffee on him. Cohen responded with a roundhouse punch to Sinatra's mouth, bloodying him. Sinatra attempted to throw a chair at Cohen but missed and hit a security guard instead. Then he left the premises.|$|E

40|$|Since {{the dawn}} of aviation, cargo loading on {{aircraft}} has remained virtually constant. A person and a <b>baggage</b> <b>cart</b> together have been the primary method of loading baggage on to aircraft, and this practice has virtually remained unchanged, especially for narrow body aircraft. This study explores {{the question of whether}} a loading device, designed for Embraer 190 aircraft, can increase economic efficiency by reducing aircraft turnaround times, increasing aircraft utilization and reducing work hours. In the course of designing a theoretical loading device for an Embraer 190, various literature ranging from elaborate articulating conveyor belts, to the use of LD 3 - 45 W containers in Airbus 320 aircraft were analyzed. In the pursuit of understanding ground operations with containers, the study looked at the Boeing 767 - 300 and the Boeing 777 - 200 LR to analyze the timeliness in which containers can be loaded and unloaded from an aircraft. With the goal of using common narrow body ground support equipment, time trials were done with a Purdue University baggage belt loader to see if loading a container on a conventional belt loader was feasible. To create a theoretical working container design, the LD 3 - 45 W boundaries in relation to the Airbus 320 aircraft cargo walls was scaled to match the Embraer 190 s. With this scale, a container size could be derived, as well as volume, capacity, tare weight and maximum weight. In determining these various parameters, the amount of baggage that could be placed in 11 loading device containers was determined. With these figures an extensive comparison between loading baggage by hand and loading baggage utilizing containers, was analyzed. ...|$|E

50|$|Almost all wheeled {{vehicles}} have a brake of some sort. Even <b>baggage</b> <b>carts</b> {{and shopping}} carts may have them {{for use on}} a moving ramp. Most fixed-wing aircraft are fitted with wheel brakes on the undercarriage. Some aircraft also feature air brakes designed to reduce their speed in flight. Notable examples include gliders and some World War II-era aircraft, primarily some fighter aircraft and many dive bombers of the era. These allow the aircraft to maintain a safe speed in a steep descent. The Saab B 17 dive bomber and Vought F4U Corsair fighter used the deployed undercarriage as an air brake.|$|R
50|$|The crest was {{attacked}} {{for a third}} time by the 1st Brigade, now supported by the 2nd Brigade, which had arrived on the battlefield. While the French were initially pushed back, Reynier sent in a stream of French units to meet the arriving British 16th Light Dragoons and the surviving soldiers of the 1st and 2nd. With the rain clearing, Reynier could also see the British divisions beginning a frontal assault. This sight persuaded Reynier to pull back, however the British were successful in seizing both his and General Pierre Soult's <b>baggage</b> <b>carts,</b> even if bad weather did prevent them from mounting a full pursuit.|$|R
50|$|The carts are {{provided}} in airports, large bus stations, hotels, or train stations for transporting luggage and may be free of charge. They are sometimes owned by the operator of the establishment. In some facilities carts may be provided by a contractor such as Smarte Carte for a rental fee. <b>Baggage</b> <b>carts</b> are usually built out of steel and equipped {{with three or four}} wheels. For safety reasons, they are generally fitted with a brake. Usually, a handle has to be pushed down in order to move the cart, however, in some cases, such as London airports, the handle activates the brake. Very few carts, e.g. in developing countries such as Sri Lanka, do not have this feature.|$|R
50|$|An example {{problem was}} the {{depressurization}} incident on Alaska Airlines Flight 536 in 2005. During ground services a baggage handler hit {{the side of the}} aircraft with a tug towing a train of <b>baggage</b> <b>carts.</b> This damaged the metal skin of the aircraft. This damage was not reported and the plane departed. Climbing through 26000 ft the damaged section of the skin gave way under the difference in pressure between the inside of the aircraft and the outside air. The cabin depressurized explosively necessitating a rapid descent to denser (breathable) air and an emergency landing. Post landing examination of the fuselage revealed a 12 in hole {{on the right side of}} the airplane.|$|R
