Non-sagacious uses (non-beneficial and unreasonable) are those uses which are without economic, practical, or other justification. Determination of sagacity involves checking alternate irrigation practices for practical, technical, economic, and environmental feasibility.

Aiming at assessing the potential irrigation performance and water saving at farm level, a set of traditional basins and another of precision-levelled basins cropped with maize, wheat and sunflower and managed by farmers were evaluated. Data were collected to characterise the basin sizes, microtopography, inflow rates, advance and recession times, cut-off time and soil water content. In addition, families of infiltration curves were derived from field observations and subsequent use of model SIRMOD. Infiltration was higher for the precision-levelled basins and decreased from the first to the next irrigation events. Infiltration data were used to support the computation of distribution uniformity (DU), <b>beneficial</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> fraction (BWUF) and deep percolation (DP). For traditional basins, DU and BWUF were low and DP was high. When precise land levelling was practised, DU increased greatly to near 94 % but BWUF improved little, because irrigation scheduling was inadequate leading to excessive water application; however, non-negligible water saving was achieved for maize and wheat since they have higher irrigation demand. In contrast, simulating the application of an appropriate irrigation scheduling through adjusting the cut-off time led to an approximately unchanged DU but BWUF greatly increased and DP reduced to 10 % on average. This condition represents a potential water saving of 34 e 39 %; however its achievement requires improved design of farm systems, appropriate irrigation water deliveries and scheduling, and the support and training of farmersinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan {{has been}} {{developed}} to facilitate the protection and restoration of Florida’s largest open-water estuary.

As such, protecting relatively uncontaminated areas of the bay from contamination and reducing the amount of toxic chemicals in contaminated sediments have been identified as high priority sediment management objectives for Tampa Bay. The purpose of the paper is to present an ecosystem-based framework for assessing and managing sediment qualityconditions to support the sediment management program. The framework includes five key elements, including identification of sediment quality issues and concerns, development of ecosystem goals and objectives, selection of ecosystem health indicators, establishment of metrics and targets for key indicators, and incorporation of key indicators, metrics, and targets into watershed management plans and decision-making processes.

Different irrigation treatments were evaluated and compared in terms of <b>beneficial</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> and physical and economical water productivity for two commodity prices and three irrigation systems scenarios applied to a medium and a large field of 5 and 32 ha respectively. Results show that deficit treatments may lead to better water productivity indicators but deficit irrigation (DI) feasibility is highly dependent on the commodity prices. Various well-designed and managed pressurized irrigation systems’ scenarios – center-pivot, set sprinkler systems and drip tape systems – were compared and ranked using multicriteria analysis. For this, three different prioritization schemes were considered, one referring to water savings, another relative to economic results, and a third one representing a balanced situation between the first two. The rankings of alternative solutions were very sensitive to the decision-maker priorities, mainly when comparing water saving and economic results because the selected alternatives were generally not common to both priority schemes. However, {{some of the best}} alternatives for the balanced priorities scheme are common to the other two, thus suggesting a possible trade-off when selecting the best alternatives. Deficit irrigation strategies also rank differently for the various scenarios considered. The study shows that deficit irrigation with exception of mild DI is generally not economically feasible. The adoption of well designed and managed irrigation systems requires consideration of priorities of farm management in terms of water saving and economic results since that some water saving solutions do not allow appropriate recover of the investment costs, particularly with DI. Basing decisions upon multicriteria analysis allows farmers and decision-makers to better select irrigation systems and related management decisions.

40|$|The Powder River Basin {{in northeastern}} Wyoming {{is one of}} the most active areas of coalbed natural gas (CBNG) {{development}} in the western United States. This resource provides clean energy but raises environmental concerns. Primary among these is the disposal of water that is co-produced with the gas during depressurization of the coal seam. Beginning with a few producing wells in Wyoming's Powder River Basin (PRB) in 1987, CBNG well numbers in this area increased to over 13, 600 in 2004, with projected growth to 20, 900 producing wells in the PRB by 2010. CBNG development is continuing apace since 2004, and CBNG is now being produced or evaluated in four other Wyoming coal basins in addition to the PRB, with roughly 3500 - 4000 new CBNG wells permitted statewide each year since 2004. This is clearly a very valuable source of clean fuel for the nation, and for Wyoming the economic benefits are substantial. For instance, in 2003 alone the total value of Wyoming CBNG production was about $ 1. 5 billion, with tax and royalty income of about $ 90 million to counties, $ 140 million to the state, and $ 27 million to the federal government. In Wyoming, cumulative CBNG water production from 1987 through December 2004 was just over 380, 000 acre-feet (2. 9 billion barrels), while producing almost 1. 5 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of CBNG gas statewide. Annual Wyoming CBNG water production in 2003 was 74, 457 acre-feet (577 million barrels). Total production of CBNG water across all Wyoming coal fields could total roughly 7 million acre-feet (55. 5 billion barrels), if all of the recoverable CBNG in the projected reserves of 31. 7 tcf were produced over the coming decades. Pumping water from coals to produce CBNG has been designated a <b>beneficial</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> by the Wyoming State Engineer's Office (SEO), though recently the SEO has limited this beneficial use designation by requiring a certain gas/water production ratio. In the eastern part of the PRB where CBNG water is generally of good quality, most of it is discharged to surface drainages or to soil (for irrigation). CBNG water quality generally declines when moving from the Cheyenne River drainage northwestward to the Belle Fourche, Little Powder, and Powder River drainages and in the central and western part of the PRB, most CBNG water goes to evaporation-infiltration ponds or is discharged directly to surface drainages. Concerns center on the salinity of the water, usually measured as total dissolved solids (TDS), or electrical conductivity (EC) and sodium adsorption ratio (SAR). Other management options currently in use include injection, managed irrigation (with additives to mitigate the effects of high salinity), atomization, and treatment by reverse osmosis or ion exchange. A key water quality issue is the cumulative effect of numerous CBNG water discharges on the overall water quality of basin streams. This leads to one of the most contentious issues in CBNG development in Wyoming's PRB: Montana's concern about the potential downstream effects of water quality degradation on rivers flowing north into Montana. Many of the benefits and costs associated with CBNG development have been debated, but dealing with CBNG water quantity and quality arguably has been the most difficult of all the issues. Given the importance of these issues for continued development of CBNG resources in Wyoming and elsewhere, the DOE-NETL funded project presented here focuses on CBNG co-produced water management. The research was organized around nine separate, but interrelated, technical project tasks and one administrative task (Task 1). The nine technical project tasks were pursued by separate research teams at the University of Wyoming, but all nine tasks were coordinated to the extent possible in order to maximize information gained about CBNG co-produced waters. In addition to project management in Task 1, the key research tasks included: (2) estimating groundwater recharge rates in the PRB; (3) groundwater contamination of trace elements from CBNG disposal ponds; (4) use of environmental tracers in assessing water quality changes in ground and surface water systems; (5) development of a software toolbox to assess CBNG water treatment technologies; (6) potential value of CBNG water for enhanced oil recovery using low salinity waterflood; (7) evaluation of natural zeolites for low cost CBNG water treatment; (8) evaluation of aquatic toxicity testing methods required by regulatory agencies on some CBNG water discharges; (9) use of remote sensing to evaluate CBNG water discharges as habitat for West Nile Virus transmitting mosquitoes; and (10) a summary of lessons learned from historic CBNG management in Wyoming...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (LL. D.) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2011. The concept "beneficial use" plays {{a pivotal}} role in South African water law reform. It forms the {{foundation}} of the mechanism to make water use rights available for the reform of the allocation of water use entitlements. The mechanism involves that water use rights that were unexercised in the two years before the promulgation of the National Water Act 36 of 1998 are not defined as existing lawful water uses. Where the concept "beneficial use" is utilised to cancel unexercised water use rights, it can cause potential hardship. Some people whose rights have been cancelled believe that {{they should be able to}} rely on the property clause in section 25 of the Constitution of 1996 to either have the legislation declared unconstitutional or to demand compensation. Section 25 of the Constitution of 1996 prohibits the arbitrary deprivation of property and states that property may only be expropriated for a public purpose or in the public interest, subject to compensation. Section 25 (4) states, however, that the public interest includes the nation's commitment to land reform and to reforms to bring about equitable access to all South Africa's natural resources. It is clear from this that reforms to bring about access to water are allowed by the property clause. One of the main questions discussed in this thesis was whether section 32 of the National Water Act 36 of 1998 that made more water available for distribution for reform purposes by cancelling unexercised water user rights, leads to an arbitrary deprivation or an expropriation of property. It should be noted that section 32 of the National Water Act did not constitute an arbitrary deprivation of property, as sufficient reason exists for water law reform. A possible constitutional challenge based on the lack of due process of law because of the retrospective operation of the section may possibly be averted because of the existence of section 33 of the National Water Act. Section 33 of the Act mitigates hardship by allowing unexercised water uses to be declared existing lawful water uses in certain circumstances where a good reason for the non–exercise of the water use right existed. Even in cases where section 33 does not prevent section 32 from being regarded as an arbitrary deprivation of property because there still was not a proper procedure, the government will probably be able to show that the limitation in section 32 is, in terms of section 36 (1) of the Constitution of 1996, reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society. Despite the fact that section 25 (1) prohibits arbitrary deprivations, it does not prohibit the government from regulating competing rights to use water even though some people may be negatively affected by the regulation. Because the Minister merely acts as public trustee of the nation's water resources on behalf of the national government in terms section 3 (1) of the National Water Act, it cannot be claimed that the government acquired the cancelled water use rights. A claim that compensation should be paid for an expropriation of property will therefore not succeed. Compensation is only payable in terms of section 22 (6) and section 22 (7) of the National Water Act 36 of 1998 for a loss of existing water entitlements, such as existing lawful water uses or existing licences. A court should thus consider interpreting section 25 by providing for compensation where an individual was unfairly burdened and was therefore denied the protection of the equality clause in section 9 of the Constitution when his unexercised water use rights were cancelled by section 32. The concept "beneficial use" currently restricts the content of the water use entitlement existing in terms of section 4 of the National Water Act 36 of 1998. The loss of the entitlement when inter alia a licence for an existing lawful water use is refused, is not protected by the payment of compensation when water is used in an unfair or disproportionate manner, because such utilisation would not be regarded to be beneficial use. It became apparent that in terms of the current water law dispensation in South Africa, the possibility of compensation for an amendment of a water use licence and the refusal of a licence for an existing lawful water use implies that a water use entitlement is a right in property. The fact that section 22 (7) of the National Water Act states that the amount of the compensation must be determined in accordance with section 25 (3) of the Constitution implies that the legislature also recognises that a water use entitlement is constitutional property. Section 22 (7) of the National Water Act underlines the basic premises of the National Water Act by subjecting the amount of the compensation that is payable to the same limitations that restrict the entitlement to use the water. The stipulations of section 22 (7) draw the attention to the fact that the exercise of both existing lawful water uses and water use licences as rights in property is subject to basic principles of the National Water Act such as the Reserve and the concepts "public trusteeship" and "beneficial use" of the water resources. The fact that compensation is only payable when there has been severe prejudice to the economic viability of an undertaking implies that water use entitlements have to be exercised at the time of the application for the compensation to be payable. The concept "beneficial use" – in the sense that a water use must not be wasteful or polluting and in the sense that only water use entitlements that are being exercised are protected – thus restricts the water use entitlement as a property right. During the research, American and Australian water law reform and their interpretation of their property clauses were compared to water law reform in South Africa and the South African property clause. Furthermore, Australian policy to encourage more <b>beneficial</b> <b>water</b> <b>use</b> by the trade in water entitlements or allocations, was also discussed. South Africans will likely in future be encouraged to trade in water use entitlements or allocations. The objective with allowing the trade in water use entitlements or allocations is to encourage people to rather use water for uses with a high value instead of uses with a lower value. In this way the concept "beneficial use" may be broadened to include water allocation or entitlement trading. However, it was argued that a disproportionate impact on third parties would mean that water allocation or entitlement trading would in some cases not be regarded as beneficial use anymore.

Historically, grazing use was often uncontrolled and much heavier than it is currently. In many allotments, grazing use has been adjusted to a level more compatible with resource capability through the application of improved grazing systems, improved forage management technology, elimination of grazing in unsuitable land types, and adjustment of animal numbers. Rangeland use includes grazing by cattle, sheep and goats, horses and saddle stock used to manage the range.

40|$|Summary Roots of {{hardwoods}} {{have been}} shown to be more vulnerable to xylem cavitation than stems. This study exam-ined whether this pattern is also observed in a conifer species. Vulnerability to cavitation was determined from the pressure required to inject air into the vascular system of hydrated roots and stems, and reduce hydraulic conductance of the xylem. According to the air-seeding hypothesis for the cavitation mechanism, these air pressures predict the negative xylem pressure causing cavitation in dehydrating stems. This was evaluated for stems of Douglas-fir (Psuedotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) and white fir (Abies concolor (Gord. & Glend.) Lindl.). The air-injection method was applied to roots and stems of different sizes and positions in Douglas-fir trees. Roots, especially smaller roots with a xylem diameter 8 mm diameter). Within the shoot system, smaller stems ( 8 mm diameter). There was no correlation between tracheid diameter and mean cavitation pressure within root or stem systems, despite larger tracheid diameters in roots (23. 3 ± 3. 9 mm) than in stems (9. 2 ± 1. 6 mm). Smaller safety margins from cavitation in roots may be <b>beneficial</b> in limiting <b>water</b> <b>use</b> during mild drought, and in protecting the stem from low xylem pressures during extreme drought...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the water quality reuse classification tool described in this document is to facilitate decision making regarding human <b>water</b> <b>uses.</b> Because not all <b>water</b> <b>uses</b> require {{the same level of}} quality, more efficient <b>water</b> <b>use</b> can be achieved by coupling processes that produce lower quality effluent to processes with minimum quality influent requirements. If effluent <b>water</b> can be <b>used</b> directly in another process, the result is significant treatment energy and cost savings. Moreover, even if minimal treatment is needed to make a process effluent usable in another sector, this coupling will decrease costs in comparison to full-scale wastewater treatment. Water reuse is clearly <b>beneficial,</b> but a <b>water</b> quality classification tool is needed to help utilities, industries, and governments establish combinations that will yield more efficient <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Such a <b>water</b> quality classification tool, shown in Table 1, has been designed.

40|$|A pot {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} {{study the effects of}} silicon (Si) and/or potassium (K) on plant growth, nitrogen uptake and N 2 -fixation in water stressed (FC 1) and well watered (FC 2) chickpea plants using 15 N and 13 C isotopes. Three fertilizer rates of Si (Si 50, Si 100 and Si 200) and one fertilizer rate of K were used. For most of the growth parameters, it was found that Si either alone or in combination with K was more effective to alleviate water stress than K alone. Increasing soil water level from FC 1 to FC 2 often had a positive impact on values of almost all studied parameters. The Si 100 K+ (FC 1) and Si 50 K+ (FC 2) treatments gave high enough amounts of N 2 -fixation, higher dry matter production and greater nitrogen yield. The percent increments of total N 2 -fixed in the above mentioned treatments were 51 and 47 % over their controls, respectively. On the other hand, increasing leave’s dry matter in response to the solely added Si (Si 50 K- and Si 100 K-) is associated with lower Δ 13 C under both watering regimes. This may indicate that Si fertilization had a <b>beneficial</b> effect on <b>water</b> <b>use</b> efficiency (WUE). Hence, Δ 13 C could be an adequate indicator of WUE in response to the exogenous supply of silicon to chickpea plants. Our results highlight that Si is not only involved in amelioration of growth and in maintaining of water status but it can be also considered an important element for the symbiotic performance of chickpea plants. It can be concluded that the synergistic effect of silicon and potassium fertilization with adequate irrigation improves growth and nitrogen fixation in chickpea plants...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} performance indicators for water resources systems (WRSs) management is efficiency. Here, water balance, based on mass conservation, is utilized to systemically develop three levels of composite efficiency indicators for a WRS, which are configurable based on two types of water totals: total inflow and total consumption (outflow that effectively is not available for reuse). The indices characterize hydrology of an area by including in their formulations the flow dynamics at three integrated levels. Furthermore, the usefulness of water is incorporated into the indicators by defining two weights: one for quality, and the other for <b>beneficial</b> attributes of <b>water</b> <b>use.</b> Usefulness Criterion is the product of quality and beneficial weights, emphasizing the equal significance of the two dimensions. Both of these weights depend on the system itself and the priorities of the supervising organization, which also are shaped by the objectives and values of the given society. These concepts lead to the definition of Macro, Meso, and Micro-Efficiencies, which form a set of integrated indicators that explicitly promotes stakeholder involvement in evaluation and design of WRSs. Macro, Meso, and Micro-Efficiencies should be maximized for both water totals, which is an integrated prerequisite for sustainability and is less promoted by competing stakeholders. To demonstrate this new framework, it is applied to published data for urban and agricultural cases and some results are explained.

The first consistent and comprehensive assessment of sectorial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) is presented by analysing homogenized annual <b>water</b> <b>use</b> data from 2000 to 2010 in relation to socio economic statistics for the same period. An abstraction of <b>water</b> <b>use,</b> using the concept of <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity, and based on equations inspired by those <b>used</b> in global <b>water</b> resource models, is developed to explore the driving forces underlying <b>water</b> <b>use</b> changes in domestic, industrial and agricultural sectors. We do this at both {{the level of the}} region as a whole, {{as well as for the}} nine cities that constitute the PRD separately. We find that, despite strong population and economic growth, the PRD managed to stabilize its absolute <b>water</b> <b>use</b> by significant improvements in industrial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensities, and early stabilisation of domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensities. Results reveal large internal differentiation of sectorial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> among the cities in this region, with industrial <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity varying from - 80 to + 95 % and domestic <b>water</b> <b>use</b> intensity by +/- 30 % compared to the PRD average.
