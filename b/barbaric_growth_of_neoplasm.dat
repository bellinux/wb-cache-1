40|$|It is an {{established}} fact that <b>growth</b> and development <b>of</b> normal tissue {{are influenced by}} temperature not only quantitatively but qualitatively (1).

40|$|Perturbation {{of oxygen}} flow occurs in disease {{states such as}} {{diabetic}} retinopathy and cancer. To maintain oxygen homoeostasis, the mammalian microvascular endothelium undergoes a dramatic reorganization to assist in bringing oxygen and nutrients to oxygen-starved tissues. This process is termed angiogenesis and is common in certain cancers with hypoxic foci and in areas of focal ischaemia in the diabetic retina. In the present study, {{we report on the}} activation of the JAK 2 /STAT 5 pathway (where JAK stands for Janus kinase and STAT stands for signal transduction and activator of transcription) by low oxygen in microvascular endothelial cells. This activation appears to occur downstream of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor), a well-known proangiogenic factor, and is related to repression of proapoptotic FAS(CD 95) /FASL(CD 95 L). These results indicate that the JAK/STAT pathway may play a pivotal role during tumour-associated or retinal angiogenesis in which endothelial cell survival during tissue hypoxia is critical for maintaining either the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>neoplasms</b> or the inappropriate retinal neovascularization common in diabetic retinopathy...|$|R
40|$|Suppressor cells {{facilitate}} the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>neoplasms</b> that have tumor-specific transplantation antigens (TSTA) (1 - 7). In in vivo neutralization tests, suppressor cells, upon exposure to TSTA, enhance the growth ofsyngeneic sarcomas in both untreated and preimmunized hosts (7). These suppressor cells are recruited from a radiosensitive T-cell population which {{is present in}} the spleens of both unsensitized and tumorbearing animals. In another system, the cells facilitating tumor growth have been shown to have surface markers that are characteristic of suppressor T cells and that are coded for by the I-J subregion of the H- 2 complex (6). Despite the presence of suppressor activity, anti-tumor immunity can regularly be demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo in mice bearing small syngeneic tumors (8). Furthermore, this immunity, once generated, is fairly radioresistant (9). Since radiosensitive suppressor cells facilitate tumor growth in vivo, since there is an anti-tumor immune response despite this suppression in tumor-bearers, and, since the immune response is fairly radioresistant, we hypothesized that whole body irradiation of mice with small tumors might preferentially interfere with the generatio...|$|R
40|$|Angiogenesis {{is one of}} the key {{stages in}} the {{development}} of neoplastic tumours, in which a small group of mutated cells transforms into a large malignant tumour metastasising to the neighbouring tissues and organs. The studies on the significance of neoangiogenesis in the progression <b>of</b> endocrine gland <b>neoplasms</b> have recently become one of the most rapidly evolving branches of molecular endocrinology. The induction of angiogenesis has been demonstrated to result from the imbalance between positive and negative factors which control this process. Our paper presents the results of current studies on the role of factors such as molecular markers of angiogenesis (e. g. vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor), metalloproteinases (which regulate the decomposition of the extracellular matrix) and their inhibitors, and adhesive molecules (e. g. soluble vascular cellular adhesion molecule- 1 and soluble intracellular adhesion molecule- 1) in the pathogenesis and diagnostics of endocrine gland tumours in humans.

Successful transplantation {{has been accomplished}} however under certain conditions, such as by planting foreign grafts in embryos (2), in the brain (3), or in the eye (4). At these sites specific resistance appears to be imperfectly developed. More controversial has been the success claimed when neoplasms have been transplanted in animals the specific resistance of which had previously been modified by removal of the spleen (5), "blockade " of the reticulo-endothelial system (6), or by intense irradiation (7). Of the several methods advocated, that of transplantation into the anterior chamber of the eye {{has the advantage of}} simplicity; moreover, it permits direct observation <b>of</b> the transplanted <b>neoplasm</b> with the microscope; its development may then be followed continuously.

40|$|Viruses exhibit an {{intimate}} type of parasitism. This phenomenon is emphasized {{by the fact}} that many of the active agents multiply only in one species of host and only in certain tissues of that host. In the course of some experiments with infectious myxomatosis it was noticed that the clinical picture and morbid anatomy of the disease in pregnant rabbits are different from those in non-gravid animals. These differences indicate a line of approach to a better understanding of the host-virus complex and are sufficiently striking to be recorded. Many investigators have observed that the course of certain tumors is influenced by pregnancy. Inasmuch as the reports and views regarding this matter are contradictory, some of the more prominent ones are cited. Morau (1), Ehrlich (2), Uhlenhuth and Weidanz (3) reported that pregnancy retards the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> transplantable tumors in mice.

40|$|Vestibular schwannomas, {{also known}} as {{acoustic}} neuromas, are benign tumors, which originate from myelin‑forming Schwann cells. They develop in the vestibular branch of the eighth cranial nerve in the internal auditory canal or cerebellopontine angle. The clinical progression of the condition involves slow and progressive growth, eventually resulting in brainstem compression. The objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the expression level and the localization of the pro‑inflammatory cytokines, transforming growth factor‑β 1 (TGF‑β 1) interleukin (IL) ‑ 1 β, IL‑ 6 and tumor necrosis factor‑α (TNF‑α), as well as the adhesion molecules, intracellular adhesion molecule‑ 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), in order to determine whether these factors are involved in the transformation and development of human vestibular schwannoma. The present study investigated whether changes in inflammation are involved in tumor growth and if so, the mechanisms underlying this process. The results of the current study demonstrated that pro‑inflammatory cytokines, including TGF‑β 1, IL‑ 1 β and IL‑ 6 exhibited increased expression in human vestibular schwannoma tissue compared with normal vestibular nerve samples. TNF‑α was weakly expressed in Schwann cells, confirming that a lower level of this cytokine is involved in the proliferation of Schwann cells. Neoplastic Schwann cells produce pro‑inflammatory cytokines that may act in an autocrine manner, stimulating cellular proliferation. In addition, the increased expression of VEGF in vestibular schwannoma compared with that in normal vestibular nerve tissue, suggests that this factor may induce neoplastic growth via the promotion of angiogenesis. The present findings suggest that inflammation may promote angiogenesis and consequently contribute to tumor progression. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that VEGF and pro‑inflammatory cytokines may be potential therapeutic targets in vestibular schwannoma. Further studies are necessary to confirm the involvement of these factors in the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>neoplasms</b> and to develop inhibitors of pro‑inflammatory cytokines as a potential treatment option in the future...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2007 In Pisum, the Np gene {{conditions}} two mitotic responses - to bruchid weevil oviposition on the pod and {{to reduced}} UV light. Oviposition by the weevil results in tumorous or neoplastic growth under the egg. Biochemically active compounds, called bruchins, were isolated from two bruchid insects (Doss et al, 2000). Femtomolar concentrations of bruchin result in {{programmed cell death}} (PCD) and neoplasm formation on the pod at the application site. PCD is evident at the application site within four hours and a large (several mg) neoplasm in five to seven days. Low UV light results in <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>neoplasm,</b> termed spontaneous neoplasm (SN), over the entire surface of the pod and, as with bruchin application, appears to begins with PCD followed by mitosis. Genotypes containing np/np do not develop SN and respond only weakly to bruchin. Both responses conditioned by Np initiate at the stomatal complex and are first detected by increased auto-fluorescence. In both cases, this is accompanied by increased peroxide/peroxidase activity first at the stomata, then radiating outward across the epidermal surface and into the mesophyll cells. Nuclei in the epidermis stained strongly for peroxide/peroxidase within 3 h of bruchin application. Nuclei in the mesophyll stained for peroxide/peroxidase by 24 h. Rose Bengal, which generates singlet oxygen, stimulated site-specific neoplasm formation on greenhouse grown pods. Lanthanum, an inhibitor of Ca 2 + influx, inhibited both ROS production and bruchin action. ZnCl 2 inhibited ROS production and bruchin response less effectively than LaCl 3. Epidermal cell death demonstrated hallmarks of apoptosis. TUNEL demonstrated the presence of oligonucleosomal fragmentation, which is associated with PCD. Pods treated with bruchin demonstrated progressive TUNEL staining. The first areas to test positive for endogenous nuclease activity were the subsidiary cells of the stomatal complex. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) found nuclear blebbing, chromatin condensation, mitochondrial swelling, changes in cytosol density and increased vacuolization. This work demonstrates that the bruchin and SN responses conditioned by the Np gene originate from similar cellular events: increased auto-fluorescence, increased peroxide/peroxidase, and PCD...|$|R

Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT), {{based on the}} glucose metabolism of malignant cells, {{plays a role in}} describing rumor <b>growth,</b> proliferation <b>of</b> <b>neoplasm</b> and the extent of metastasis. In general, concordant findings of skeletal metastasis are seen on both types of image, especially in cases of breast and lung cancer. However, there were extremely discordant findings of skeletal metastasis between bone scans and F 18 FDG PET/CT imaging in two cases among 300 consecutive F 18 FDG PET/CT follow-up exams of patients with malignancies, during the past year, in our center. Both cases, one of breast cancer and one of lung cancer, had negative bone scintigraphic findings, but a diffusely high grade of F 18 FDG avid marrow infiltration in the axial spine, leading to the diagnosis of stage IV disease in both cases. Owing to variant genetic aberrance of malignance, F 18 FDG PET/CT reveals direct evidence <b>of</b> diffuse, rapid <b>neoplasm</b> metabolism in the bone marrow of the spine, but not of secondary osteoblastic reactions in vivo. F 18 FDG PET/CT should always be employed in the follow-up of patients with malignancies...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Immune {{response}} {{plays an}} important role in the interaction between malignant neoplasms and their host, which is reflected as histologic changes in the lymph nodes draining tumours. MATERIAL: 641 regional lymph nodes from 64 primary carcinomas of breast, stomach and colon were examined to assess such a response. METHODS: The lymphnodes were classified into one of the following histological patterns [...] lymphocyte predominance (LP), germinal centre predominance (GCP), lymphocyte depletion (LD) and unstimulated (U). RESULTS: LP (T Cell response) was the frequently observed pattern in the lymph nodes of breast and stomach. A similar pattern was observed among the survivors irrespective of the involvement of lymph node with tumour. There was a significant association between the histologic pattern of lymph node and stage & grade of the disease in breast carcinoma. CONCLUSION: The correlation of lymph node histology with grade and extent of the disease & survival indicate that the immune system is important in regulating the <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> malignant <b>neoplasms.</b> Such information may help as prognostic indicator and as therapeutic guide for immunotherapy...|$|R
40|$|The {{continued}} <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> solid <b>neoplasms</b> {{is always}} associated with neovascularization. A possible mediator is tumorangiogenesis factor (TAF), an endothelial cell mitogen {{which has been}} extracted {{from a variety of}} solid malignant tumors, in this laboratory (1). The specific blockade of this factor, "anti-angiogenesis, " has been proposed as a new approach to the control <b>of</b> malignant <b>growth</b> (2, 3). The consequences of failure of neovascularization for tumor growth have been fortuitously observed in two experimental situations. In isolated perfused organs, in which endothelial cell degeneration has occurred (4) and new vessel outgrowth is not possible, tumor implants grow to a small size (2 - 3 mm diameter) but no further (5). Similarly, during experiments with heterologous tumor transplantation in guinea pig eyes (6), Green observed that a few implants, which apparently did not vascularize, failed to grow for almost 2 yr. However, when these same tumors were reimplanted into their original host, they vascularized and grew progressively. These observations suggested that a fundamental relationship might exist between angiogenesis and the ability of a tumor to grow malignantly. Th...|$|R
40|$|Background : In recent years, {{the method}} of photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been increasingly used in {{clinical}} oncology. Three non-toxic components play {{a key role in}} realization of the anti- tumor effect of PDT: a photosensitizer (PS), local irradiation of the tumor with light/laser of a certain wavelength corresponding to the sensitizer absorption peak, and oxygen. The highly reactive biological oxidants formed during photochemical reactions exert a destructive effect on cells and tumor vasculature with subsequent activation of the immune response. Efficiency of PDT is determined by the level of PS accumulation in tumors, as well as by its photophysical parameters and photochemical activity. To create a new PS, natural chlorophylls and their derivatives with intense absorption in the long-wave region of the spectrum are of particular interest. Aim : To study the efficacy and mechanism of PDT action (using a conjugate containing two molecules of dipropoxy-bacteriopurpurinimide with a cystamine residue as a PS) on the growth and functional morphology of transplanted solid connective tissue tumor. Materials and methods : The study was carried out in female white outbred rats with subcutaneously implanted sarcoma M- 1. PS was injected to rats of the experimental group intraperitoneally. PDT was performed during the maximal index of tumor/ healthy tissue contrast after the administration of the PS. The criterion of PDT efficacy was a change in the tumor growth/regression coefficient. The research methods included immunohistochemistry for PCNA and CD 31, evaluation of mitotic activity and apoptosis of tumor cells, as well as computer analysis of microscopic images. Results : After PDT with the new PS, a 16 -fold decrease of growth coefficient of tumor nodes was registered.  The photo-induced antitumor effect was shown to be due to destruction of sarcoma M- 1 vascular bed, rapid inhibition of proliferative activity and devitalization of tumor cells. At early stages after PDT, destruction of the microvasculature and photo-cytostatic shock of tumor cells with subsequent development of necrosis appears to be caused by direct influence of the light flux on sensitized cellular elements in tumor parenchyma and stroma.   Conclusion : The final result of PDT is determined by the sequence of destructive and inflammatory changes in the tumor parenchyma and surrounding tissues, as well as by a proliferative potential of malignant cells surviving after treatment. The surviving tumor cells, which determine the recurrent <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> <b>neoplasms</b> after PDT, are still present, maybe due to an insufficient concentration of the sensitizer in certain weakly vascularized areas of sarcoma M- 1. </p...|$|R
40|$|A case {{of primary}} hemangioendothelioma {{of the liver}} with histopathological {{features}} characteristic of an infantile hemangioendothelioma of the liver, in a 24 -year-old male, was reported. The patient {{was found to have}} marked hepatomegaly and ascites over a prolonged period of time and succumbed with hematemesis and melena about 2 years after the onset of his illness or about 16 months after the development of ascites. Multiple tumor nodules of 0. 5 to 1. 5 cm in diameter, reddishpurple in the center and greyish-white at the periphery, were found throughout the liver with pronounced cicatrization on limited area of the left lobe at autopsy. Hemangioendotheliomas of the liver in infants are congenital and many of the patients develop symptoms ranging from 36 hours to 4 1 / 2 years of age. Although these tumors are histologically benign, most patients die within 6 months following the onset of their illness because <b>of</b> a rapid <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>neoplasm.</b> The findings noted in the case described herein would suggest that, in rare instances, hemangioendotheliomas of the liver in infants may grow very slowly or remain latent over a prolonged period of time...|$|R
40|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} indicate that immunoglobulin-bound prolactin found in human serum {{is not a}} conventional complex between an anti-prolactin antibody and prolactin but {{a different type of}} association of prolactin with the Fab portion of IgG heavy chains. The complex of prolactin with IgG was purified from serum by anti-human prolactin affinity chromatography and was shown to contain close to 1 mole of N epsilon-(gamma-glutamyl) lysine crosslinks per mole of complex, a characteristic feature in structures crosslinked by transglutaminase. Interestingly, the complex caused a proliferation of cells from a subset of patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, while it was inactive in a cell proliferation prolactin bioassay. By contrast, human prolactin stimulated the proliferation of cells in the bioassay but had no effect on the complex-responsive cells from the patients. Competition studies with prolactin and free Fc fragment of IgG demonstrated a necessity for engaging both the prolactin and the immunoglobulin receptors for proliferation. More importantly, competition for the growth response by free prolactin and IgG suggests both possible reasons for the slow <b>growth</b> <b>of</b> this <b>neoplasm</b> as well as avenues for control of the disease...|$|R
