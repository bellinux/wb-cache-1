25|$|In Faraday's {{model of}} {{electromagnetic}} induction, a circuit received an induced current when it cut lines of magnetic flux. According to this model, the Faraday disc should have worked when either the disc or the magnet was rotated, but not both. Faraday attempted {{to explain the}} disagreement with observation by assuming that the magnet's field, complete with its lines of flux, remained stationary as the magnet rotated (a completely accurate picture, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>not</b> intuitive in the lines-of-flux model). In other words, the lines of flux have their own frame of reference. As we shall see in the next section, modern physics (since {{the discovery of the}} electron) does not need the lines-of-flux picture and dispels the paradox.|$|E

[...] The team of New Release Tuesday, [...] "a popular music website in the Christian community", praised the song, with reviews saying, [...] " [...] is without a doubt one of Bebo Norman's best songs." [...] A review by Lancaster Online called [...] "Britney" [...] a [...] "hit song", and described it as [...] "a compassionate look at someone damaged, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>not</b> broken, by the relentless glare of the spotlight."

500|$|IGN's Matt Risley {{rated the}} episode an 8 out of 10, calling it more [...] "classically, indulgently, infectiously Christmassy" [...] than the {{previous}} Christmas specials. He praised the production design and special effects teams for [...] "creating some dazzlingly memorable special effects, and a winter wonderland that was both recognisably, fuzzily Christmas incarnate and unerringly, tensely alien" [...] but thought the supporting cast [...] "triumphed above and beyond" [...] the plot devices. Like Hogan, Risley commented that the comedian cast of Bailey and Weir as well as Armstrong [...] "felt lacking". However, the next year, Risley wrote that he [...] "got a little carried away with the festive funtimes ... On reflection, the overwhelming Christmassyness of it all was overcompensating for a pretty flimsy, frivolous plot." [...] Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the special {{four out of five}} stars, praising Smith's acting and Blackburn's Doctor Who directing debut as well as the special effects. However, he thought that the lack of a villain was an [...] "interesting experiment, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>not</b> ideal for Christmas Day" [...] and Bailey and Weir's forest rangers [...] "felt like bolt-on comic relief".|$|E

500|$|Carey {{expressed}} how {{she considered}} Mimi the [...] "main course", {{and felt that}} the new album would be treated as [...] "dessert". In an interview with NME, the singer described her choice on the album's title: [...] "Basically, I'm freer on this album than I've ever been. Some of the songs on the last album were cool <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>not</b> quite as neat as this album." [...] When questioned if the title represented Carey's interest in physics, she jokingly added [...] "Einstein's theory? Physics? Me? Hello! I even failed remedial math. I could not pass seventh grade math even in the lowest class with the worst kids." [...] The album's similarity to its predecessor is not only found in the title and music, but also in its artwork. In the album's cover art, she holds almost the exact pose as from her last album, only with different lighting and wardrobe. It features a black backdrop, with Carey completely naked, except for a large feathered shawl covering her body. Only her first name appears in large pink letters on the cover, with 'E=MC²' appearing in small white letters on the top. In describing the cover, Macpherson wrote [...] "Carey is naked but for the world's largest feather boa, an accessory for which flocks of birds have surely given their lives." ...|$|E

Abrams added that the film's ending was intended to be [...] "this great long drum roll up to seeing this guy".|$|E
2500|$|Gwen Ihnat of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode {{positive}} review, {{giving it a}} B-. While she liked the episode, she left some reservations: [...] "Ultimately, depending on what you want from your Once, “Dreamcatcher” {{was a bit of}} a let down. It moved the plot along, but at a feverish pace and with built in leaps in faith and storyline that just haven’t been explained enough. (How, for instance, did Emma learn that she could capture memories in dreamcatchers? [...] And why is that the craft she chose now that she doesn’t need to sleep?) Maybe all those assumptions and conclusions will be eventually explained in one of those “ohhhhh, I get it now” summations a couple of episodes down the road, <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> <b>not.</b> Once’s writers and creators have a tendency to play fast and loose with their storylines, knowing their audience will just kind of accept it and move on. Thus, these kinds of leaps aren’t really out of the question for them. (You can’t blame them, really. We’re already watching a show about fairy tales, for crying out loud.) But I didn’t really get “Dreamcatcher.” I’m not sure that I’m supposed to yet, and down the road I might change my mind and say, “you know, that was the episode I need to go back and watch now that I know what I know.” But for now, it just left me a little cold.

40|$|Among the {{invariant}} factors g of {{a positive}} semidefinite analytic function f on R 3, those g whose zero set Y is a curve are called special. We show that if each special g is a sum of squares of global meromorphic functions on a neighbourhood of Y, then f is a sum of squares of global meromorphic functions. Here sums can be (convergent) infinite, but we also find some sufficient conditions to get finite sums of squares. In addition, we construct several examples of positive semidefinite analytic functions which are infinite sums of squares <b>but</b> <b>maybe</b> could <b>not</b> be finite sums of squares...|$|R
