5000|$|Toyota {{unveiled}} the 2008 Toyota Sequoia at the November 2007 Los Angeles Auto Show, with sales beginning that following December. Like the original Sequoia, {{the new model}} {{is based on the}} new Tundra. However major differences with the Tundra include a fully boxed frame, a rear independent suspension featuring double wishbones with coil springs for improved ride comfort and room, and a locking center differential on 4-wheel drive models. The new suspension helps give the Sequoia a tighter turning radius of 19 ft and allows for a fold-flat rear seat. Toyota stated the new frame is 70 percent more resistant to <b>bending</b> <b>flex</b> with torsional rigidity up 30 percent [...] However, the new model weighs 500 lb more than the previous Sequoia. The drag coefficient has been reduced to 0.35.|$|E
40|$|To {{establish}} {{the relationship between}} locomotory behavior and dynamics of neural circuits in the nematode C. elegans we combined molecular and theoretical approaches. In particular, we quantitatively analyzed the motion of C. elegans with defective synaptic GABA and acetylcholine transmission, defective muscle calcium signaling, and defective muscles and cuticle structures, and compared the data with our systems level circuit model. The major experimental findings are: (i) anterior-to-posterior gradients of body <b>bending</b> <b>flex</b> for almost all strains both for forward and backward motion, and for neuronal mutants, also analogous weak gradients of undulatory frequency, (ii) existence of some form of neuromuscular (stretch receptor) feedback, (iii) invariance of neuromuscular wavelength, (iv) biphasic dependence of frequency on synaptic signaling, and (v) decrease of frequency with increase of the muscle time constant. Based on (i) we hypothesize that the Central Pattern Generator (CPG) {{is located in the}} head both for forward and backward motion. Points (i) and (ii) are the starting assumptions for our theoretical model, whose dynamical patterns are qualitatively insensitive to the details of the CPG design if stretch receptor feedback is sufficiently strong and slow. The model reveals that stretch receptor coupling in the body wall is critical for generation of the neuromuscular wave. Our model agrees with our behavioral data(iii), (iv), and (v), and with other pertinent published data, e. g., that frequency is an increasing function of muscle gap-junction coupling.

40|$|The portal axle is an {{off-road}} technology {{which is}} designed to provide higher ground clearance and increased torque at the wheels. The portal axle is typically mounted on the knuckle of the vehicle, allowing both the axle tubing and differential casing to be mounted higher under the vehicle. The usage of the portal axle system brings about two distinctive drawbacks; compromised ride comfort and increased torsional loadings on the drive shaft. In this study, an experimental test was carried out to determine the torsional strength and failure mode of the portal axle drive shaft. The experimental results were then verified using Finite Element Analysis (FEA). Results from both experimental and FEA methods indicate that shaft failure occurs at the gear spline. However, there is a big discrepancy in the torsional stress values, in which the FEA results are significantly higher than the measured experimental values. This is reasonable considering that the shaft simulation analysis is conducted in a static structural manner, in which the flanged side of the shaft is fixed (zero displacement). On the other hand, this study also describes the influence of portal axles on passenger ride comfort. Here, the on road experiment is conducted by placing an accelerometer in the cabin of a portal axle equipped vehicle. The ride comfort experiments are conducted using two vehicles. The first being a normal pickup truck and the second being a pickup truck with the portal axles equipped. Both vehicles are of the same make, model and age. All measurements are performed on normal highways and over regular speed humps. The results from the ride comfort experiment indicate that the use of the portal axles result in significant deterioration of ride comfort. In order to validate the experimental results, a quarter car model representing the portal axle vehicle is simulated using Matlab’s Simulink function. Simulation results also indicate that the use of the portal axles adversely affects the ride comfort. However, when comparing the simulation to the experimental results, there is an 18 % discrepancy in the results. This is primarily attributed {{to the fact that the}} quarter car model does not take into account the suspension bushings, suspension joints and chassis <b>bending</b> (<b>flex)</b> of the vehicle...|$|E

5000|$|Modern rotor {{systems may}} use the {{combined}} principles of the rotor systems mentioned above. Some rotor hubs incorporate a flexible hub, which allows for blade <b>bending</b> (<b>flexing)</b> {{without the need for}} bearings or hinges. These systems, called [...] "flexures", are usually constructed from composite material. Elastomeric bearings may also be used in place of conventional roller bearings. Elastomeric bearings are constructed from a rubber type material and provide limited movement that is perfectly suited for helicopter applications. Flexures and elastomeric bearings require no lubrication and, therefore, require less maintenance. They also absorb vibration, which means less fatigue and longer service life for the helicopter components.|$|R

40|$|Activity of the hypaxial muscles during {{walking and}} {{swimming}} {{was measured in}} the salamander Dicamptodon ensatus. D ring walking, there was activity {{on both sides of}} the trunk simultaneously. The obliquus externus superficialis and profundus muscles were active on the side towards which the trunk was <b>bending</b> (<b>flexing),</b> while the obliquus internus and transversalis muscles were active on the opposite side. In contrast, during swimming, all four of these muscles were active on the side of the trunk that was bending to become concave. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that during terrestrial ambulation the obliquely oriented hypaxial muscles do not contribute to lateral bending of the trunk or to horizontal propulsion, but to stabilization of the trunk against long-axis torsion...|$|R

5|$|Cotto faced WBC, The Ring and lineal middleweight {{champion}} Sergio Martinez for {{the titles}} on June 7, 2014 {{in his first}} fight in the middleweight division at Madison Square Garden. It {{should be noted that}} Martinez was inactive for a year before this bout and had two separate surgeries performed on his right knee. Throughout the fight, journalists and fans alike, noticed Martinez was unable to <b>bend,</b> <b>flex</b> and support his own weight while moving in the ring. Martinez himself proclaimed that his knee {{had nothing to do with}} the outcome of the fight and his struggles were a result of a body shot. Cotto knocked Martinez down 3 times in the first round and once in the ninth round before Martinez retired on his stool before the tenth round, giving Cotto the win by ninth-round corner retirement. With the win, Cotto became the first Puerto Rican boxer to win world titles in four different weight classes.|$|R
50|$|Any {{clothing}} on {{the corpse}} is removed and set aside, and any personal effects such as jewelry are inventoried. A modesty cloth is sometimes {{placed over the}} genitalia. The corpse is washed in disinfectant and germicidal solutions. During this process the embalmer <b>bends,</b> <b>flexes,</b> and massages the arms and legs to relieve rigor mortis. The eyes are posed using an eye cap that keeps them shut and in the proper expression. The mouth may be closed via suturing with a needle and ligature, using an adhesive, or by setting a wire into the maxilla and mandible with a needle injector, a specialized device most commonly used in North America and unique to mortuary practice. Care is taken to make the expression look as relaxed and natural as possible, and ideally a recent photograph of the deceased while still living {{is used as a}} reference. The process of closing the mouth and eyes, shaving, etc. is collectively known as setting the features.|$|R
30|$|It {{is known}} that {{abrasion}} is the physical destruction of fibers resulting from frictional forces developed by mechanical repetition of lateral stresses. This causes rupture of fibers from their normal position through <b>bending</b> and <b>flexing.</b> In both acid- and neutral-stable cellulase-treated samples, a very little amount of mass loss occurred due to the smoothness of the fabric surface after biopolishing action, causing higher abrasion resistance performance.|$|R
50|$|Variations can be {{described}} in three main categories, fast, medium, or slow with variations in between each. A rod with a fast taper will only flex the top 20 percent. Medium fast and medium tapers will flex approximately 30 to 60 percent of the rod respectively. If the rod has a slow taper, almost the entire rod or blank will <b>bend</b> or <b>flex</b> under pressure.|$|R
50|$|The rope is the {{defining}} characteristic of an elevated passenger ropeway. The rope stretches and contracts as the tension exerted upon it increases and decreases, and it <b>bends</b> and <b>flexes</b> as it passes over sheaves and around the bullwheels. The fibre core contains a lubricant which protects the rope from corrosion and also allows for smooth flexing operation. The rope must be regularly lubricated to ensure safe operation and long life.|$|R
50|$|Beyond that, {{the wing}} is {{designed}} to <b>bend</b> and <b>flex</b> in the wind, and so provides favorable dynamics analogous to a spring suspension. Flexibility allows the wing to be less susceptible to turbulence and provides a gentler flying experience than a similarly-sized rigid-winged aircraft. The trailing edge of the wing - which is not stiffened - allows the wing to twist, and provides aerodynamic stability {{without the need for}} a tail (empennage).|$|R
50|$|Modifications in {{movements}} and position. Triggering {{factors that can}} cause RLP are sudden movements, (e.g. sitting up and down, standing up, sneezing, coughing), physical exertion, and long periods in the same resting position. A change in daily activities can help find relief and prevent worsening of the condition. Avoid sudden movements that can cause spasms of the ligament. When about to sneeze or cough, brace yourself by <b>bending</b> and <b>flexing</b> the hips to minimize the pull on the ligaments.|$|R

40|$|The {{spinal column}} {{performs}} important {{functions in the}} body, including {{the support of the}} entire weight of the human body, the ability to orientate the head in space, <b>bending,</b> <b>flexing</b> and rotating the body. Diseases affecting the spine are manifold: the most frequent is scoliosis, which often affects the female population. It is often treated surgically with a very high percentage of failures. The aim of the thesis is to study the role of instrumentation in mechanical failures encountered 12 months after surgery in the treatment of scoliosis. For the purposes of the study, we analyzed specific biomechanical parameters. The pelvic angles determine the position of the pelvis, while the imbalance parameters the structure of the body. We infer other parameters by analyzing the characteristics of the implanted instrumentation. Initially, the anatomy is described of the spine and vertebrae, the equipment used and the possible failures that may occur after surgery. Subsequently, the materials and methods used for the analysis of the above-mentioned parameters for the 61 patients are reported. All data are obtained by the observation of pre and post-operative x-rays with a special program, by reading reports from operators and by medical records. In the fourth chapter, we report the results: the overall failure rate is 60. 9...|$|R
40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} the aortic {{heart valve}} is a challenging endeavor {{because of the}} particular hemodynamic and biologic conditions present in the native aortic heart valve. The backbone of an ideal valve substitute should be a scaffold that {{is strong enough to}} withstand billions of repetitive <b>bending,</b> <b>flexing</b> and stretching cycles, while also being slowly degradable to allow for remodeling. In this review, we highlight three overlooked aspects that might influence the long term durability of tissue engineered valves: (i) replication of the native valve trilayered histoarchitecture, (ii) duplication of the three-dimensional shape of the valve, (iii) and cell integration efforts focused on getting the right number and type of cells to the right place within the valve structure and driving them towards homeostatic maintenance of the valve matrix. We propose that the trilayered structure in the native aortic valve that includes a middle spongiosa layer cushioning the motions of the two external fibrous layers should be our template for creation of novel scaffolds with improved mechanical durability. Furthermore, since cells adapt to micro-loads within the valve structure, we believe that interstitial cell remodeling of the valvular matrix will depend on the accurate replication of the structures and loads, resulting in successful regeneration of the valve tissue and extended durability...|$|R

40|$|Soft {{robotics}} is {{an emerging}} field that {{takes advantage of}} compliant materials and makes use of nonstandard actuators. Flexible fluid actuators (FFAs) use fluid pressure to produce high deformation of elastomeric-based structures. However, closed-loop control of such actuators is still very challenging {{due to the lack}} of robust, reliable, and inexpensive sensors that can be integrated onto highly deformable actuator structures, involving very low cost materials and manufacturing. This paper presents a systematic approach to implement the feedback control of FFA-based soft robotic bending modules by using commercial <b>flex</b> <b>bend</b> sensors. A <b>flex</b> <b>bend</b> sensor detects the module curvature in one direction, and its response is processed by an on board microcontroller and sent to the central control system. Such sensor integration enables the closed-loop control of modular robotic architectures, often used in soft robotics. Once integrated with the soft module, the sensor response was calibrated by the use of a ground truth electro-magnetic tracking system in order to characterize its behavior when combined with the relative FFA. A feedback control using a low-pass filter and a proportional-integral controller was designed and used to evaluate the dynamic response and the position accuracy of the integrated module. With such closed-loop control, the module tip is positioned with less than 1 mm accuracy, which can be considered a relevant result in the soft robotics field...|$|R
40|$|Filling the {{interspace}} between {{package and}} the {{printed wiring board}} (PWB), namely underfilling, was demonstrated to yield dramatic reliability improvement in the mechanical shock and <b>bending</b> (<b>flexing)</b> of most Chip Scale Package (CSP) assemblies in Mobile Phone applications. However, rework of defective CSPs cannot be performed after the underfill operation. Thus, inability to rework assemblies has hindered the wide spread use of underfill materials. However, reworkability of the packages with underfill is, needed for Circuit Card Assemblies (CCAs) with CSPs failing either during final test or in the field. This investigation provides initial results of an on-going study aimed at thermo-mechanical reliability of the CSP assemblies with reworkable underfills in mobile phone application. Two reworkable underfills, I and II were evaluated {{in order to find}} a suitable system for CSP assemblies. Material properties such as coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE), glass transition temperature (Tg), modulus, strength of adhesion' etc were obtained. Tests that simulate the production process and product reliability tests have been conducted with these materials. A comparative study of the performance of CCAs with two reworkable underfill materials, snap-cure (non-reworkable) underfill & no-underfill materials are reported. Results of mechanical & thermal shock tests, cycle time studies, ease of reworkability, and cure times are discussed. Underfill I was demonstrated to be a better choice for the application under consideration, based on the current results. I...|$|R

50|$|Modern arrows {{are made}} to a {{specified}} 'spine', or stiffness rating, to maintain matched flexing and hence accuracy of aim. This flexing can be a desirable feature, since, when {{the spine of the}} shaft is matched to the acceleration of the bow(string), the arrow <b>bends</b> or <b>flexes</b> around the bow and any arrow-rest, and consequently the arrow, and fletchings, have an un-impeded flight. This feature is known as the archer's paradox. It maintains accuracy, for if part of the arrow struck a glancing blow on discharge, some inconsistency would be present, and the excellent accuracy of modern equipment would not be achieved.|$|R
50|$|Rigidity is the {{property}} of a structure {{that it does not}} <b>bend</b> or <b>flex</b> under an applied force. The opposite of rigidity is flexibility. In structural rigidity theory, structures are formed by collections of objects that are themselves rigid bodies, often assumed to take simple geometric forms such as straight rods (line segments), with pairs of objects connected by flexible hinges. A structure is rigid if it cannot flex; that is, if there is no continuous motion of the structure that preserves the shape of its rigid components and the pattern of their connections at the hinges.|$|R

40|$|A long (20 - 30 micrometer), wide (3 - 5 micrometer) microbial-mat {{bacterium}} {{from the}} Ebro Delta (Tarragona, Spain) was grown in mixed culture and videographed live. Intracellular elemental sulfur globules and unique cell termini {{were observed in}} scanning-electron-microprobe and transmission-electron micrographs. A polar organelle underlies bundles of greater than 60 flagella at each indented terminus. These Gram-negative bacteria <b>bend,</b> <b>flex,</b> and swim in a spiral fashion; they translate at speeds greater than 10 body lengths per second. The large size of the spirillum permits direct observation of cell motility in single individual bacteria. After desiccation (i. e., absence of standing water for at least 24 h), large populations developed in mat samples remoistened with sea water. Ultrastructural observations reveal abundant large sulfur globules irregularly distributed in the cytoplasm. A multilayered cell wall, pliable and elastic yet rigid, distends around the sulfur globules. Details of the wall, multiflagellated termini, and large cytoplasmic sulfur globules indicate that these fast-moving spirilla are distinctive enough to warrant a genus and species designation: Titanospirillum velox genus nov., sp. nov. The same collection techniques at a similar habitat in the United States (Plum Island, northeast Essex County, Massachusetts) also yielded large populations of the bacterium among purple phototrophic and other inhabitants of sulfurous microbial-mat muds. The months-long survival of T. velox from Spain and from the United States in closed jars filled with mud taken from both localities leads us to infer that this large spirillum has a cosmopolitan distribution...|$|R

Wartime haste in building, insufficient clearance between the rotating and fixed structure of the turret, insufficient full calibre firing exercises and extensive arrangements to prevent flash from reaching the magazines made it mechanically complex, leading to problems during prolonged actions. In order to bring ammunition into the turret at any degree of train, the design included a transfer ring between the magazine and turret; this did not have sufficient clearance {{to allow for the}} ship <b>bending</b> and <b>flexing.</b> Improved clearances, improved mechanical linkages, and better training led to greater reliability in the quadruple turrets but they remained controversial.|$|R

To ensure reliable functioning under <b>bending</b> and <b>flexing,</b> strong interfacial adhesion between the nanowire and the matrix is needed. In situ uniaxial tensile tests of individual, chemically functionalized, Si microwires embedded in a compliant PDMS matrix reveal that chemical functionality on Si microwire surfaces is directly correlated with interfacial adhesion strength.

Conductivity changes are negligible when the sample is stretched reversibly up to 30 % and no major defects are introduced, in comparison to continuous sheets which quickly tear. Scaling analysis shows that our method is suited to further miniaturization and large-scale fabrication of stretchable functional films. It thus opens routes to stretchable interconnects in electronic, photonic, and sensing applications, {{as well as a}} wide variety of other deformable structures...|$|R
