5|$|In some areas, {{introduced}} {{black and}} brown rats raid nests for eggs and young. Cats also threaten the red-billed tropicbird. This <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> {{considered to be}} a least-concern species according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), though populations are thought to be declining. In some places, such as Brazil and Mexico, this <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> considered to be threatened.|$|E
5|$|Although the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> not {{considered}} endangered over {{the majority of}} its range, populations are showing some decline, especially in southern Australia, and local action plans are being undertaken in some areas. It is the official bird emblem of the state of Queensland.|$|E
5|$|Naturally, fictional birds do {{not exist}} {{and will not be}} found in nature. But as a supplement, the {{following}} fictional <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> included in the list due to its deep association Kansas history and lore.|$|E
50|$|There is {{consensus}} among paleontologists that <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{the descendants of}} coelurosaurs. Under modern cladistic definitions, <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> considered the only living lineage of coelurosaurs. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora.|$|R
500|$|The <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{divided into}} {{granivorous}} (grain eating) and carnivorous groups, which are explained in some detail. The speed, senses, flight, migration, pairing behaviour and feeding of <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> then discussed, with observations from Spallanzani and Gilbert White, whose Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne {{was published in}} 1789. The pleasure of watching <b>birds</b> <b>is</b> mentioned: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1999 seven {{birds and}} in 2000 again 10 <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{released}}. Thus in all 31 sub-adult <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{released in the}} pre-selected proper habitat of the birds.|$|R
5|$|Queensland is {{the state}} in which the {{greatest}} numbers of brolgas are found, and sometimes flocks of over 1,000 individuals are seen here. The <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> the official bird emblem for the state and also appears on its coat of arms.|$|E
5|$|The <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> part of {{an annual}} census, the Great Cocky count, that has been held every year since 2009 to track the {{population}} change of Red-tailed and other black cockatoos.|$|E
5|$|The eastern {{mourning}} dove (Z. m. carolinensis) is Wisconsin's official symbol of peace. The <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> also Michigan's state bird of peace.|$|E
5|$|Native American {{folklore}} {{held that}} the <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> the last to seek shelter before a hurricane, {{and the first to}} emerge afterwards. The <b>bird</b> <b>was</b> thus a symbol for danger and optimism.|$|R
50|$|The <b>bird</b> life <b>is</b> rich, {{especially}} during the migration seasons. Ducks, geese and wading <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> especially abundant.|$|R
25|$|The next {{significant}} {{event was}} on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, {{and more than}} 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> killed and the remainder scattered before any more could be killed. No more <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> sighted that day.|$|R
5|$|The {{northern}} mockingbird (Mimus polyglottos) {{is the only}} mockingbird commonly found in North America. This <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> mainly a permanent resident, but northern birds may move south during harsh weather. This species has rarely been observed in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Ancient Egyptian {{names for}} crow or raven species include very {{possibly}} gbgb/gbg3; this <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> once called 3pd km or 'black bird', while its eggs could apparently be gathered {{according to a}} medical papyrus, and therefore points to a breeding bird of Egypt. In demotic an ʾbḳ-bird can be determined by help {{of the existence of}} Coptic abook 'Crow, raven'. But perhaps the latter is also a derivatiuon of the bird name kbk.|$|E
5|$|In Hans Christian Andersen's {{version of}} the story, a bluebird had been viewing Thumbelina's story since the {{beginning}} and had {{been in love with}} her since. In the end, the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower-fairy prince, and flies off eventually arriving at a small house. There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself and chronicles the story in a book.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> again {{voted in}} by the fans for the Indigenous All Stars team to play the NRL All Stars in the annual All Stars match. In April 2012, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> again {{selected}} for the Country Origin team in the annual City vs Country Origin match. In 2012, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> again selected for New South Wales in all 3 games of the 2012 State of Origin series.|$|R

50|$|Some {{scientists}} {{claim that}} after plucking, mamo were kept as pets, or cooked. Others {{claimed that the}} <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> released, {{and that there was}} a Kapu or restriction that required live release. Even if the <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> released, they would still be {{in a state of shock}} and risk injury. However, Hawaiian <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> relatively tame and unafraid when captured, and so might have survived handling better than most birds.|$|R
5|$|In general, common ravens {{live in a}} {{wide array}} of environments but prefer heavily {{contoured}} landscapes. When the environment changes in vast degrees, these birds will respond with a stress response. The hormone known as corticosterone is activated by the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis. Corticosterone is activated when the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> exposed to stress, such as migrating great distances.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} is insectivorous {{and climbs}} up tree trunks like a mouse, {{to search for}} insects which it picks from crevices in the bark with its fine curved bill. It then flies {{to the base of}} another tree with a distinctive erratic flight. This <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> solitary in winter, but may form communal roosts in cold weather.|$|E
5|$|The adult annual {{survival}} rate across {{most of the}} range is around 51%, and a small Belgian study found a 25% local {{survival rate}} for juveniles. The typical lifespan is two years and the maximum known age for a wild <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> 12years 11months in the UK. There is also a Swiss longevity record of 10years 6months.|$|E
5000|$|Trapshooting {{has been}} a sport since the late 18th century when real <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> used; usually the {{passenger}} pigeon, which was extremely abundant at the time. <b>Birds</b> <b>were</b> placed under hats or in traps which were then released. Artificial <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> introduced {{around the time of}} the American Civil War. Glass balls (Bogardus) and subsequently [...] "clay" [...] targets were introduced in the later 1800s, [...] gaining wide acceptance.|$|R
50|$|Some of Whitaker's {{collection}} of Tunisian <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> in the Natural History Museum, London. The Sicilian <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> {{divided between the}} Royal Scottish Museum (bird skins) and the Ulster Museum (bird mounts, eggs and nests).|$|R
50|$|The <b>Birds</b> <b>was</b> MacLeod’s {{first major}} public art commission, and is {{situated}} in Vancouver British Columbia. Partially inspired by Alfred Hitchcock's film The Birds (1963), The <b>Birds</b> <b>is</b> a large sculpture of two house sparrows, <b>birds</b> that <b>are</b> not indigenous to British Columbia. This sculpture challenges the idea of place and impossibility.|$|R
5|$|The {{black vulture}} is {{considered}} a threat by cattle ranchers due to its predation on newborn cattle. The droppings produced by black vultures and other vultures can harm or kill trees and other vegetation. The <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> also considered {{a threat to the}} safety of aerial traffic, especially when it congregates in large numbers in the vicinity of garbage dumps—as is the case in the Rio de Janeiro Tom Jobim International Airport.|$|E
5|$|The call of {{the great}} spotted {{woodpecker}} is a sharp kik, which may be repeated as a wooden rattling krrarraarr if the <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> disturbed. The courtship call, gwig, is mostly given in the display flight. The great spotted woodpecker drums on dead trees and branches, and sometimes suitable man-made structures, to maintain contact between paired adults and to advertise ownership of territory.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{was introduced}} to Jamaica in 1903, and the Bahamas and Cuba were colonised naturally from the US. This <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> fairly common but local in Jamaica, Grand Bahama and Bimini, and is rare {{in the rest of}} the Bahamas, eastern Cuba, the Cayman Islands, Puerto Rico and St. Croix.|$|E
50|$|<b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> {{educated at}} Cranmore School, West Horsley, the Royal Grammar School, Guildford, and Queens' College, Cambridge, where he read English. At Cambridge, <b>Bird</b> <b>was</b> the President of the Footlights, the university's sketch and {{theatrical}} group.|$|R
5|$|<b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> considered a separate class that had evolved from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. <b>Birds</b> <b>are</b> classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.|$|R
30|$|In contrast, Preference {{scores for}} <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> {{relatively}} low, although <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> often {{among the most}} popular animals (e.g., Norris and Pain 2002; Schlegel and Rupf 2010). However, a previous study showed that small <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> the most favorable animals among urban Malaysians (Nik Mohamad 2011). Kingfishers, swallows, and crows might not be good representatives of “small birds” for urbans. Therefore, this result might be partly due to our choice of bird species. It would be necessary to determine which <b>bird</b> species <b>are</b> popular among Malaysian urban people to select relevant flagship bird species.|$|R
5|$|The curve-billed thrasher can {{generally}} be found running rapidly from {{cover to cover}} or flying near ground level from bush to bush. However, this <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> not shy about being in the open. It is generally a forager on ground level but can be very aggressive in routing out potential competitors for food at feeders, such as the Inca dove and round-tailed ground squirrel. It will usually destroy any nest of cactus wrens.|$|E
5|$|The greater Phoenix {{region is}} home to the only {{thriving}} feral population of rosy-faced lovebirds in the U.S. This <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> a popular birdcage pet, native to southwestern Africa. Feral birds were first observed living outdoors in 1987, probably escaped or released pets, and by 2010 the Greater Phoenix population had grown to about 950 birds. These lovebirds prefer older neighborhoods where they nest under untrimmed, dead palm tree fronds.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} natural philosopher, a forerunner {{of the modern}} scientist, recreating one of Robert Boyle's air pump experiments, in which a <b>bird</b> <b>is</b> deprived of air, before a varied group of onlookers. The group exhibits a variety of reactions, {{but for most of}} the audience scientific curiosity overcomes concern for the bird. The central figure looks out of the picture as if inviting the viewer's participation in the outcome.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} more than 480 species of <b>birds</b> have <b>been</b> {{recorded}} in Nevada, and of these, 300 species have either nested or are estimated to occur with regularity in the state. The majority of Nevada’s breeding <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> landbirds, but {{a large percentage of the}} priority species are shorebirds and waterbirds, reflecting the importance of water bodies in the desert. 78 species of Nevadan <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> currently identified as priority species. These <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> subdivided into 70 Conservation priority species, five Stewardship species, and three Special Status species.|$|R
5000|$|The {{species has}} become {{established}} in southern San Diego County (2013), {{especially in the}} Tijuana River Valley. The <b>birds</b> <b>are</b> presumably descendants of escapees from nearby Tijuana, Baja California, where the trade in <b>birds</b> <b>is</b> unregulated [...]|$|R
40|$|Many Sandwich Terns {{spend the}} post {{breeding}} {{period in the}} Firth of Forth. By reading the inscriptions of rings {{with the help of}} a telescope, information about the origin and movements of 45 <b>birds</b> <b>was</b> obtained in the period 2000 – 2004. Most of these <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> ringed at the Farne Islands or further north in Scotland, from Orkney to Fife. The remaining <b>birds</b> <b>were</b> ringed in Ireland, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark...|$|R
