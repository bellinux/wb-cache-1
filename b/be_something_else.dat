It is for these objects that representation theory is needed for the mathematical description of transformations induced by ordinary Lorentz transformations of spacetime. For instance, the electromagnetic field is often (naively) envisaged by the assignment to each point in spacetime of a three-dimensional vector representing the electric field and another three-dimensional vector representing the magnetic field.|$|E
25|$|The same {{rational}} way {{of thought}} {{led him to}} introduce the abstract apeiron (indefinite, infinite, boundless, unlimited) as an origin of the universe, a concept that is probably influenced by the original Chaos (gaping void, abyss, formless state) of the mythical Greek cosmogony from which everything else appeared. It also takes notice of the mutual changes between the four elements. Origin, then, must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> unlimited in its source, that could create without experiencing decay, so that genesis would never stop.|$|E
25|$|There is {{evidence}} {{to believe that}} the development of theory of mind is closely intertwined with language development in humans. One meta-analysis showed a moderate to strong correlation (r = 0.43) between performance on theory of mind and language tasks. One might argue that this relationship is due solely to the fact that both language and theory of mind seem to begin to develop substantially around the same time in children (between ages 2–5). However, many other abilities develop during this same time period as well, and do not produce such high correlations with one another nor with theory of mind. There must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> going on to explain the relationship between theory of mind and language.|$|E

25|$|The {{standard}} of 'fair and reasonable' must therefore <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> and I cannot {{think of any}} other standard appropriate than the normal needs of an average employee, regarded {{as a human being}} in a civilised community. If, instead of individual bargaining, one can conceive of a collective agreement - an agreement between all the employers in a given trade on the one side, and all the employees on the other - {{it seems to me that}} the framers of the agreement would have to take as the first and dominant factor the cost of living as a civilised being. If A lets B have the use of his horses on the terms that he gives them fair and reasonable treatment, I have no doubt that it is B's duty to give them proper food and water, and such shelter and rest as they need; and, as wages are the means of obtaining commodities, surely the State in stipulating for fair and reasonable remuneration for the employees means that the wages shall be sufficient to provide these things, and clothing and a condition of frugal comfort estimated by current human standards.|$|E

[...] Tolkien gives an allegory of a man who inherits a field full of stone from an old hall.

While training as a boxer, he began painting portraits of boxers and sold some cartoons to The Hobo News. Seeking work as a commercial illustrator while doing various odd jobs, Buscema found himself instead entering the comic book field in 1948, landing a staff job under editor-in-chief and art director Stan Lee at Timely Comics, the forerunner of Marvel Comics. The Timely [...] "bullpen", as the staff was called, included such fellow staffers as established veterans Syd Shores, Carl Burgos, Mike Sekowsky, George Klein, and Marty Nodell and hired, roughly two months earlier, newcomer Gene Colan.

2500|$|... it {{was pointed}} out that the vacuum decay rate could be vastly {{increased}} in the vicinity of black holes, which would serve as a nucleation seed. According to this study a potentially catastrophic vacuum decay could be triggered any time by primordial black holes, should they exist. If particle collisions produce mini black holes then energetic collisions such as the ones produced in the LHC could trigger such a vacuum decay event. However the authors say {{that this is not a}} reason to expect the universe to collapse, because if such mini black holes can be created in collisions, they would also be created in the much more energetic collisions of cosmic radiation particles with planetary surfaces. And if there are primordial mini black holes they should have triggered the vacuum decay long ago. Rather, they see their calculations as evidence that there must <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> preventing vacuum decay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} known map is {{a matter}} of some debate, both because the term [...] "map" [...] isn't well-defined and because some artifacts that might be maps might actually <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> A wall painting that might depict the ancient Anatolian city of Çatalhöyük (previously known as Catal Huyuk or Çatal Hüyük) has been dated to the late 7th millennium BCE. Among the prehistoric alpine rock carvings of Mount Bego (F) and Valcamonica (I), dated to the 4th millennium BCE, geometric patterns consisting of dotted rectangles and lines are widely interpreted in archaeological literature as a depiction of cultivated plots. Other known maps of the ancient world include the Minoan [...] "House of the Admiral" [...] wall painting from c. 1600 BCE, showing a seaside community in an oblique perspective and an engraved map of the holy Babylonian city of Nippur, from the Kassite period (14th12th centuries BCE). The oldest surviving world maps are from 9th century BCE Babylonia. One shows Babylon on the Euphrates, surrounded by Assyria, Urartu and several cities, all, in turn, surrounded by a [...] "bitter river" [...] (Oceanus). Another depicts Babylon as being north of the world center.|$|E

2500|$|During {{its opening}} weekend, After Earth took in $27.5 million in box office {{receipts}} in North America and $2.5M in South Korea. Sony Pictures projected a launch of around $38 million, but the actual number was 17% lower than the lowest pre-release expectation of $33 million. It finished in third place behind Fast & Furious 6, an action film, and Now You See Me, a caper film. Taking into account the popularity of principal actor Will Smith, the disappointing finish led The Wall Street Journal {{to call it a}} [...] "flop". Ray Subers of Box Office Mojo noted the $27 million weekend placed it between two sci-fi flops of 2012 films with 200 million-plus budgets, Battleship ($25.5 million) and John Carter ($30.2 million), and also drew half of the co-stars' previous openings, Will Smith's Men in Black 3 ($54.6 million) and Jaden Smith's The Karate Kid ($55.7 million). Scott Mendelson from Forbes argued that Sony made a mistake of hiding M. Night Shyamalan as they promoted the film because for better or worse, the general public knows who he is and [...] "His name on the marquee reflects that you’re {{not going to get a}} conventional genre film, that there may <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> up its sleeve." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{manifestation of}} the stirrup was a toe loop that held the big toe and was used in India late {{in the second century}} BC, though may have appeared as early as 500 BC. This ancient foot support consisted of a looped rope for the big toe which was {{at the bottom of a}} saddle made of fibre or leather. Such a configuration was suitable for the warm climate of south and central India where people used to ride horses barefoot. A pair of megalithic double bent iron bars with curvature at each end, excavated in Junapani in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh have been regarded as stirrups although they could as well <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Buddhist carvings in the temples of Sanchi, Mathura and the Bhaja caves dating back between the 1st and 2nd century BC figure horsemen riding with elaborate saddles with feet slipped under girths. In this regard archaeologist John Marshall described the Sanchi relief as [...] "the earliest example by some five centuries of the use of stirrups in any part of the world". [...] Later, a single stirrup was used as a mounting aid by a nomadic group known as the Sarmatians.|$|E
2500|$|According to his {{promoter}} Cisek, Theodorescu-Sion's organic {{treatment of}} nature emanates from [...] "the fundamental law" [...] of Romania's ancient folk arts, namely: [...] "man does not master surrounding nature; he grows from the stony and craggy soil [...] like plants, like trees, like animals." [...] This, Cisek argues, was {{the revelation of}} a true artistic expression of the Romanian soul, opposed to the idyllic canvasses of Impressionist master Nicolae Grigorescu, but akin to the Poporanist prose of Calistrat Hogaș. In 1926, he assessed: [...] "It has been said—and many among the artistically illiterate continue to repeat as much to this day—that only Grigorescu's art can ever be Romanian, and that Theodorescu-Sion's painting can {{have nothing in common}} with the substance of our soil. [...] tomorrow perhaps, [...] may find himself able to overturn skeptical impressions and theories". Cisek depicts Sion as Romania's [...] "best connoisseur of artistic techniques", with a [...] "sovereign mastery", locating him at the opposite end from post-Grigorescu official art. Sion's understanding of national specificity, he argues, had nothing in common with the [...] "mulligan" [...] traditionalism of Octav Băncilă and Kimon Loghi: [...] "if Mr. Loghi is a painter, then Teodorescu-Sion must surely <b>be</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> entirely! One should bear in mind that Mr. Teodorescu-Sion is still developing, whereas 'Master' Loghi has reached his summit. The summit of mediocrity." [...] Contrarily, Nichifor Crainic, who was a Grigorescu aficionado, posthumously described Sion as Grigorescu's one equal; however, he noted, Sion bowed to commissions, and as such never produced an actual masterpiece.|$|E

However, the magazine said that [...] "Max thrives on passion and deceipt, so getting it on with Kat behind Tanya's back would be consistent." [...] They also said he was busy with his own problems, but had form finding Slater (Kat's maiden name) women irresistible (he had an affair with Stacey Slater (Lacey Turner) years earlier).

Soaplife said Max was [...] "least likely even though he has the track record and the matching morals of an alley cat." [...] Actor Wood had previously promised a big storyline for Max, but Soaplife did not think this would be it.

[...] All About Soap called Max a [...] "love rat", but doubted that he would cheat on Tanya again, but as it's Max, [...] "all bets are off {{when it comes to the}} bedroom", and said he was the second most likely suspect. In September 2012, Richie said he thought that Max was the most likely suspect, saying [...] "I think it's Max. You can't trust him!" [...] Wood stated that [...] "It would definitely be in keeping with Max for him to be having an affair. He's got a chequered history and women are his Achilles heel.
