40|$|The {{properties}} of several different investments were investigated including phosphate bonded, magnesia bonded, and alumina cement investments. Measurements included the setting expansion, thermal expansion, and compressive strength of investments, {{as well as}} the tensile strength, elongation, Vickers hardness (VHN) and surface roughness of titanium castings. For phosphate <b>bonded</b> <b>investment,</b> the setting expansion after being mixed with its own mixing solution was 2. 10 %, which was larger than the other investments; the thermal expansion was - 0. 25 % at 200 degrees C, the compressive strength 14 and 5 MPa after heating. For titanium cast in phosphate <b>bonded</b> <b>investment,</b> the hardness on its top surface was 655 Hv, the tensile strength was 379 MPa, the elongation was 19. 4 %, and the surface roughness was 2. 29 mu m. Athough the thermal expansion of phosphate <b>bonded</b> <b>investment</b> is small, the setting expansion is large enough to compensate for the shrinkage of titanium castings. As its thermal expansion at T >= 600 degrees C was constant and its heating-cooling cycle was almost reversible, these two properties can reduce the thermal shock and thus avoid cracking of the investment...|$|R

40|$|The {{study is}} to {{evaluate}} and compare the Diametral Tensile strength of Phosphate <b>bonded</b> <b>Investment</b> materials (Wirovest, Cromocasting Fast and Accuvest) after drying by Air dried method, Conventional Hot air oven method and Microwave oven method. A total of 90 cylindrical specimens were prepared from three different commercially available phosphate <b>bonded</b> <b>investment</b> materials. Thus 30 samples for each material were prepared and 10 of each were Air dried for 60 minutes, 10 were dried in a Conventional Hot air oven for 60 minutes t 265 c to 300 ˚c nd 10 were dried in Microw ve oven with 600 w tts t frequency of 2450 MHz for 10 minutes. All the samples were subjected to diametral compression test using a computer coordinated Universal testing machine at 2 hour interval at a crosshead speed of 0. 5 cm/min.

As an example, suppose a manager knows that investing in a conservative project, such as a <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> or another project with no risk, yields a known rate of return. When analyzing a new project, the manager may use the conservative project's rate of return as the MARR. The manager will only implement the new project if its anticipated return exceeds the MARR by at least the risk premium of the new project.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is fourfold. First, to investigate whether the determinants of international equity investment differ between investors with different degrees of information, experience and sophistication. For this purpose, the determinants of international equity investment of institutional and noninstitutional investors from 20 OECD countries, in the period 2001 - 2009, were analysed and compared. The results show that there are significant differences in the determinants of international equity investment between institutional and noninstitutional investors. Particularly, noninstitutional investors exhibit a more pronounced preference for equities of geographical nearby, contiguous and more transparent countries than institutional investors, suggesting that the effect of information costs and familiarity on international equity investment is stronger for less informed, experienced and sophisticated investors. Moreover, the preference for more developed equity markets and the contrarian behaviour are more severe for noninstitutional investors. Hence, the heterogeneity of institutional and noninstitutional investors in international equity investment is not negligible and therefore should be taken into account. Second, to investigate whether the determinants of international <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> differ between investors with different degrees of information, experience and sophistication. For this purpose, the determinants of international <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> of institutional and noninstitutional investors from 20 OECD countries, in the period 2001 - 2009, were analysed and compared. The results show that there are few significant differences in the determinants of international <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> between institutional and noninstitutional investors. Particularly, the preference for bonds of more transparent countries and the return chasing behaviour are more pronounced for noninstitutional investors, whereas the preference for bonds with lower risk diversification potential is more pronounced for institutional investors. Hence, not only the results for international <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> do not allow to support (or reject) the argument that information costs and familiarity are more important for less informed, experienced and sophisticated investors, but also they are contrary to the idea that financial variables, namely return and risk diversification, are more important for more informed, experienced and sophisticated investors. Third, to investigate whether the determinants of international equity investment differ from the determinants of international <b>bond</b> <b>investment.</b> For this purpose, the determinants of both international equity and <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> of institutional and noninstitutional investors from 20 OECD countries, in the period 2001 - 2009, were analysed and compared. The results show that, although the effect of information costs on international equity investment tends to be stronger than on international <b>bond</b> <b>investment,</b> the differences between assets are not usually statistically significant, especially when the influence of financial variables is taken into account. Hence, {{it is not possible to}} conclude that international equity investment is much more information intensive than international <b>bond</b> <b>investment,</b> as suggested by Gehrig (1993) and Portes, Rey and Oh (2001), among others. Fourth, to investigate whether the flight to quality phenomenon is also observable in international investment and whether the flight to quality phenomenon is more pronounced for more sophisticated than for less sophisticated investors. For this purpose, a two-factor and three-factor ANOVA models, respectively, were applied to the international equity and <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> of institutional and noninstitutional investors from 20 OECD countries in the period 2001 - 2009. The results suggest that the flight to quality phenomenon is also observable in international investment, as a change from business cycle of expansion to recession causes investors to significantly decrease the average weight invested in more risky assets (equities) and increase the average weight invested in less risky assets (bonds). The results also show that the variation on the average weight assigned to each type of asset, due to changes in business cycles, is significantly stronger for institutional investors than for noninstitutional investors, thereby suggesting that the flight to quality phenomenon is more pronounced for more sophisticated than for less sophisticated investors...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} portfolios {{within the}} framework of a dynamic asset-pricing model when investors can trade equity assets as well as bonds of many different maturities. We specify the model so that investors have demand for both a risky and a safe income stream. We characterize the resulting optimal equilibrium stock and bond portfolios and document that optimal <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> strategies partly exhibit a ladder structure, if a sufficient number of bonds is available for trade. The main contribution of the paper is to show that complete ladders with all bonds in the economy combined with a market portfolio of equity assets are nearly optimal investment strategies. This paper therefore provides a rationale for bond ladders as a popular <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> strategy...|$|E
40|$|Many bond {{portfolio}} managers argue that bond laddering tends to outperform other <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> strategies because it reduces both market price risk and reinvestment {{risk for a}} {{bond portfolio}} {{in the presence of}} interest rate uncertainty. Despite the popularity of bond ladders as a strategy for managing investments in fixed-income securities, there is surprising little reference to this subject in the economics and finance literature. In this paper we analyze complex bond portfolios within the framework of a dynamic general equilibrium asset-pricing model. Equilibrium bond portfolios are nonsensical, implying a trading volume that vastly exceeds observed trading volume on ¯nancial markets. Such portfolios would also be very costly and thus suboptimal in the presence of even very small transaction costs. Instead portfolios combining bond ladders with a market portfolio of equity assets are nearly optimal investment strategies, which in addition would minimize transaction costs. This paper, therefore, provides a rationale for bond ladders as a popular <b>bond</b> <b>investment</b> strategy...|$|E
