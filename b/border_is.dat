5|$|A {{topographic}} map {{shows that the}} majority of the interconnected complex of tightly packed lakes with their valley-and-ridge landscape is primarily in Minnesota; the border of the landscape is the Canada–US border. This <b>border</b> <b>is</b> composed of the Pigeon River, and these Rove Formation lakes (going east to west): South Fowl, North Fowl, Moose, Mountain, Watap, Rose, South, Little North and Gunflint. The border runs approximately through the center of the lengths of these lakes. The only Rove-typical east-west oriented lakes lying in Ontario are Arrow and North lakes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>borders</b> <b>are</b> {{usually the}} first to fail, as they get {{separated}} {{from each other and}} from the central picture; losses in <b>borders</b> <b>are</b> common and original <b>borders</b> <b>are</b> rare. The upper <b>borders</b> <b>are</b> usually at highest risk. Creasing in the lining has been observed as well; the main cause has been suggested to be due to the dimension of the lining being greater than the thangka, which may be an original concept in thangka construction.|$|R

5|$|The Coat of Arms {{consists}} of a gold shield with red edges, divided into four triangular compartments by a blue, diagonal St. Andrew's Cross. A golden book, symbolizing learning, sits open at {{the centre of the}} cross. In each of the four compartments is an emblem of the university's Canadian and British origins: a pine tree for Canada, a thistle for Scotland, a rose for England, and a shamrock for Ireland.

5|$|Allan <b>Border</b> <b>is</b> {{a former}} {{international}} cricketer and {{captain of the}} Australia cricket team. A left-handed middle order batsman, he scored centuries in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches organised by the International Cricket Council (ICC). Border scored 11,174 runs in 156 Tests and captained Australia in 93 of them. He holds the record for consecutive appearances (153 matches) as a player in Tests. Border was named by Wisden {{as one of its}} five Cricketers of the Year in 1982. He was the second Australian player after Sir Donald Bradman to receive the Order of Australia (AM) for his contribution to cricket, and was one of 55 initial inductees of the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame.|$|E

5|$|Deserts {{are also}} classified, {{according}} to their geographical location and dominant weather pattern, as trade wind, mid-latitude, rain shadow, coastal, monsoon, or polar deserts. Trade wind deserts occur {{either side of the}} horse latitudes at 30° to 35° North and South. These belts are associated with the subtropical anticyclone and the large-scale descent of dry air moving from high-altitudes toward the poles. The Sahara Desert is of this type. Mid-latitude deserts occur between 30° and 50° North and South. They are mostly in areas remote from the sea where most of the moisture has already precipitated from the prevailing winds. They include the Tengger and Sonoran Deserts. Monsoon deserts are similar. They occur in regions where large temperature differences occur between sea and land. Moist warm air rises over the land, deposits its water content and circulates back to sea. Further inland, areas receive very little precipitation. The Thar Desert near the India/Pakistan <b>border</b> <b>is</b> of this type.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Company C, 1st Battalion, 65th Infantry Regiment was {{deployed}} to the Horn of Africa and stationed at Camp Lemonnier in Djibouti, after completing a 14-month deployment at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Company C carried the crew-served weapons {{to protect the}} camp. It also operated the entry control checkpoints, protected U.S. and allied ships at the massive Djibouti Port, and guarded the U.S. Embassy there. By mid-2009, {{the rest of the}} battalion deployed there in case a larger combat maneuver element was needed to operate from the base. The area is considered to be the most unstable part of Africa, and the Somali <b>border</b> <b>is</b> less than 10 miles from Camp Lemonnier.|$|E
5|$|South Dakota is {{situated}} in the north-central United States, and {{is considered to be}} a part of the Midwest by the U.S. Census Bureau, although the Great Plains region also covers the state. Additionally, the culture, economy, and geography of western South Dakota has more in common with the West than the Midwest. The state has a total land area of 77,116sq.miles (199,905km2), making it the 17th largest in the Union. South Dakota is bordered to the north by North Dakota; to the south by Nebraska; to the east by Iowa and Minnesota; and to the west by Wyoming and Montana. The western <b>border</b> <b>is</b> the Black Hills meridian, a north-south line set out at a certain distance from Washington, D.C., to separate South Dakota from Montana and Wyoming during the transition to statehood.|$|E
50|$|In some places, villages {{adjoining}} the <b>border</b> <b>were</b> fenced {{with wooden}} board fences (Holzlattenzaun) or concrete barrier walls (Betonsperrmauern) standing around 3 - 4 m high. Windows in buildings adjoining the <b>border</b> <b>were</b> bricked or boarded up, and buildings deemed {{too close to}} the <b>border</b> <b>were</b> pulled down.

5000|$|On February 24, 1904, Missouri filed a claim {{with the}} Supreme Court {{claiming}} jurisdiction in 196 U.S. 23 (1904) [...] Nebraska filed a cross suit. Missouri argued that when Congress approved {{the extension of}} borders under the Platte Purchase the <b>border</b> <b>was</b> to be {{the middle of the}} river (although the <b>border</b> <b>was</b> not surveyed at the time). Nebraska argued that its <b>borders</b> <b>were</b> surveyed when it entered the union.|$|R

5|$|The Absaroka and Beartooth Mountains {{are partly}} in the {{northern}} section of the forest. The Wind River Range is in the southern portion and contains Gannett Peak, the tallest mountain in Wyoming. Yellowstone National Park forms part of the boundary to the west; south of Yellowstone, the Continental Divide separates the forest from its neighbor Bridger-Teton National Forest to the west. The eastern boundary includes privately owned property, lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the Wind River Indian Reservation, which belongs to the Shoshone and Arapahoe Indians. Custer National Forest along the Montana <b>border</b> <b>is</b> on the northern frontier. The Oregon Trail, the 19th century covered wagon route, passes {{just south of the}} forest, where broad and gentle South Pass allowed the migrants to bypass the rugged mountains to the north.|$|E
5|$|The Oklahoma panhandle's Western edge {{is out of}} {{alignment}} with its Texas border. The Oklahoma/New Mexico <b>border</b> <b>is</b> 2.1 to 2.2 {{miles east of the}} Texas line. The border between Texas and New Mexico was set first {{as a result of a}} survey by Spain in 1819. It was then set along the 103rd Meridian. In the 1890s, when Oklahoma was formally surveyed using more accurate surveying equipment and techniques, it was discovered the Texas line was not set along the 103rd Meridian. Surveying techniques were not as accurate in 1819, and the actual 103rd Meridian was approximately 2.2 miles to the east. It was much easier to leave the mistake than for Texas to cede land to New Mexico to correct the surveying error. The placement of the Oklahoma/New Mexico border represents the true 103rd Meridian.|$|E
5|$|The nilgai is {{categorised}} as of Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural resources (IUCN). While it {{is common}} in India, the nilgai occurs sparsely in Nepal and Pakistan. The major reasons behind its decimation in these two countries and extinction in Bangladesh are rampant hunting, deforestation and habitat degradation in the 20th century. As of 2008, the feral population in Texas was nearly 37,000. Wild populations also exist in the US states of Alabama, Florida and Mississippi and the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, where they have escaped from private exotic ranches. The population around the Texas-Mexico <b>border</b> <b>is</b> estimated to be around 30,000 (as of 2011).|$|E

5|$|Today, the {{international}} <b>border</b> <b>is</b> firmly established and peaceful; {{there is a}} greater sense of Canadian nationality, and fears of U.S. Manifest Destiny have all but disappeared. Canada and the U.S. have formalized their trading partnership with the North American Free Trade Agreement, leading to increased trade between the two nations. This trade now coursing up and down the valleys of the Red and Mississippi rivers more than fulfils Lord Selkirk's predictions made nearly two centuries ago; while he first sought access over U.S. territory for the succour of his nascent colony, now commerce in manufactures and commodities goes in both directions. The trade corridor once occupied by the long-gone Red River Trails continues to be employed for its historic purposes.|$|E
