40|$|A simple, selective, precise, {{sensitive}} and accurate high performance thin layer chromatographic {{method of analysis}} for the determination of <b>Balofloxacin</b> in both bulk drug and in formulation was developed and validated. The method employed TLC aluminium plates precoated with silica gel 60 F 254 as the stationary phase. The solvent system consists of methanol: water: triethylamine (6 : 4 : 0. 5 v/v/v). This system was found to give compact spots for <b>Balofloxacin</b> (Rf value of 0. 48 ± 0. 02). Dentiometric analysis of <b>Balofloxacin</b> {{was carried out in}} the absorbance mode at 266 nm. The linear regression analysis data for the calibration plots showed good linear relationship with r = 0. 999 with respect to peak height and peak area, in the concentration range of 500 - 3000 ng per band. The method was validated for accuracy, precision and recovery. The method is simple and accurate, separation is good, right <b>Balofloxacin</b> quality control has obvious practical valu...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{pharmacokinetics}} and tolerability {{were studied}} in healthy elderly volunteers for two new fluoroquinolones, <b>balofloxacin</b> (Q- 35) and grepafloxacin (OPC- 17116), the main excretion routes being the renal and hepatic routes, respectively. Both agents were well tolerated in elderly subjects. In comparison with previously reported data from healthy younger adults, {{the absorption of}} <b>balofloxacin</b> was slightly delayed and urinary excretion was delayed and diminished. As a significant linear correlation was observed between renal clearance of <b>balofloxacin</b> and creatinine clearance, the delayed and diminished urinary recovery was attributed to the reduced renal function of the elderly subjects enrolled in the study. The absorption of grepafloxacin was also delayed, and the maximum plasma drug concentration and area under the plasma drug concentration-time curve were increased in the elderly by 31 and 48 %, respectively, over those in younger adults {{on the basis of}} dose normalized to body weight. The plasma terminal elimination half-life and urinary recovery remained unchanged. Decreases in distribution volume and total body clearance in the elderly were considered to be the primary factors contributing to these differences...|$|E
40|$|A rapid, reliable, {{sensitive}} UV-spectrophotometric {{method has}} been developed for the determination of <b>Balofloxacin</b> in bulk and marketed tablet dosage form using 1 % w/v of ferrous sulphate as a chromagenic / complexing agent. The yellow colour complex formed by complexation of iron (II) with balofloxacinwas stable and was measured for absorbance at its λ max of 357 nm. The Beers law was obeyed at the concentration range of 10 - 100 µg / ml with good correlation coefficient of 0. 9992. The method was optimized and validated for linearity, accuracy and precision. The proposed method is simple and can be routinely used for the estimation of <b>balofloxacin</b> in its tablet formulations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} visible spectrophotometric method {{was developed and}} validated for the determina-tion of <b>balofloxacin</b> in bulk and marketed tablet dosage form using 1 % w/v of ceric sulphate as chromogenic agent. The brown coloured complex formed by cerium (IV) solution with <b>balofloxacin</b> was stable up to 30 min and was measured for absorbance at its λ max of 492 nm. The Beers law concentration range was found to 10 - 100 µg/ml with good correlation coefficient of 0. 9922. The method was optimized and validated for linearity, accuracy and precision. The validated method was accurate as found from recovery of 97. 14 % to 98. 88 % when applied for marketed tablet formulations...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Two new, simple, {{accurate}} and sensitive spectrophotometric methods {{has been developed}} and validated {{for the analysis of}} <b>balofloxacin</b> in tablet dosage formulations. The drug undergoes oxidation with a known excess of cerium (IV) sulphate in acidic medium and the residual oxidant is determined by reaction with fixed concentration of methyl or-ange (max 511 nm) in first method and with indigo carmine (max 613 nm) in the second method. The two methods have been validated separately. The Beer’s law was obeyed in the range of 0. 1 - 2. 5 μg/ml with first method and 1 - 7 μg/ml for the second method, with good correlation coefficient of 0. 9970 and 0. 9980 respectively. The method was validated in terms of accuracy and precision and successfully applied to the determination of the drug in its pharmaceutical formulations. The amount of <b>balofloxacin</b> determined by the proposed method conformed with the label claim of the formulations. Analytical Methods for Determination o...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to develop and validate a simple, sensitive, precise, economical, reproducible and accurate isocratic reversed phase high performance liquid chromatographic method for separation and analysis of 6 fluoroquinolones in bulk and their pharmaceutical dosage forms. The effects of mobile phase composition, buffers, pH, and acetonitrile concentrations were investigated on the separation of third generation fluoroquinolones (levofloxacin, sparfloxacin, <b>balofloxacin)</b> and fourth generation fluoroquinolones (gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, prulifloxacin) were assayed without any interference. RP-HPLC method was developed by using Welchrom C 18 Column (4. 6 X 250 mm, 5 µm), Shimadzu LC- 20 AT prominence liquid chromatograph. The mobile phase consisting of phosphate buffer pH- 3. 1 and acetonitrile in the portion of 70 : 30 v/v. Isocratic elution at a flow rate of 1 ml/min was employed. The responses were measured at 293 nm using Shimadzu SPD- 20 A prominence UV-Vis detector. The method was successfully applied to Moxifloxacin pharmaceutical dosage form. During method validation parameters such as linearity, precision, specificity, robustness, ruggedness were evaluated from spiked tablet samples according to ICH guidelines, which remained within acceptable limits. The proposed method can also be extended for the determination of other five fluoroquinolones or their combinations...|$|E
