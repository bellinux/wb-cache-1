40|$|Blast <b>resistant</b> <b>glazing</b> systems {{typically}} use {{laminated glass}} {{to reduce the}} risk of flying glass debris in an explosion. Laminated glass has a bonded polymer interlayer that retains glass fragments upon fracture. With proper design, the flexibility of the interlayer in laminated glass can offer protection from significantly higher blast loads when compared to an equivalent monolithic pane. This thesis investigates the post-fracture behaviour of laminated glass under blast loading and aims to build the knowledge required to improve design methods for blast <b>resistant</b> <b>glazing.</b> Full-scale open-air blast tests were performed on laminated glass containing a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) interlayer. Test windows ranged in size from 1. 5 m× 1. 2 m to 3. 5 m× 1. 8 m and were bonded to robust frames using structural silicone sealant. Blast loads were produced using charge masses of 15 kg to 500 kg (TNT equivalent) and distances of 10 m to 30 m. Deflection and shape measurements were obtained using high-speed digital image correlation. Measurements of loading at the joint were also made with strain gauges. The main failure mechanisms observed were the cohesive failure of the bonded silicone joint and tearing of the interlayer. These failure mechanisms were investigated further using a highspeed tensile test machine to reproduce blast loading conditions. Cracked laminated glass samples were loaded in tension at varying rates. Their response was characterised by a rate dependant plateau force which can be used to estimate the maximum load on the glazing joint. Delamination between the PVB and glass was found to play a key role in the laminate response. Thinner PVB and higher strain rates reduced the delamination area, leading to premature tearing of the interlayer. The strength of structural silicone sealant in a blast situation was also investigated. A novel test method was used to determine the bond length required to retain the laminated glass window in a blast event. A nominal strength of not greater than 1. 1 MPa should be used for design of conventional single-sided silicone joints. A finite element model of the laminated glass response to blast loading was developed using the results of the experimental investigations. The failure predictions of the model were compared against a single-degree-of-freedom (SDOF) model and showed good agreement. Differences in the deflected shape at maximum deflection were seen between the model and those measured in blast testing.

Explosive cladded two or multilayer materials serve as final product or as semi-finished product for further processing, e. g. rolling.

40|$|AbstractBlast <b>resistant</b> <b>glazing</b> systems {{typically}} use {{laminated glass}} {{to reduce the}} risk of flying glass debris in the event of an explosion. Laminated glass has one or more bonded polymer interlayers to retain glass fragments upon fracture. With good design, the flexibility of the interlayer and the adhesion between layers enable laminated glass to continue to resist blast after the glass layers fracture. This gives protection from significantly higher blast loads when compared to a monolithic pane. Full-scale open-air blast tests were performed on laminated glass containing a polyvinyl butyral (PVB) interlayer. Test windows of size 1. 5 m× 1. 2 m were secured to robust frames using structural silicone sealant. Blast loads were produced using charge masses of 15 kg and 30 kg (TNT equivalent) at distances of 10 – 16 m. Deflection and shape measurements of deforming laminated glass were obtained using high-speed digital image correlation. Measurements of loading at the joint, between the laminated glass and the frame, were obtained using strain gauges. The main failure mechanisms observed were the cohesive failure of the bonded silicone joint and delamination between the glass and interlayer at the pane edge.

In 2014 the global market for flame retardants {{is expected to reach}} $ 6. 10 billion with a drive in research for designing and developing new fire resistant materials. A commercially available product based on a hydrogel/glass composite is an effective fire and heat <b>resistant</b> <b>glazing</b> that is employed in the commercial and domestic sector. The macroscopic effects of these materials have been investigated; however no information exists on the molecular level properties. Therefore, the aim of this research is to fully characterise a series of hydrogels with the ultimate goal of understanding structure-property relationships. The hydrogels discussed herein are made by drying commercially available sodium-silicate solutions onto traditional float glass to create a sandwich glazing. The materials present a unique challenge to characterise at the molecular level because of their amorphous and metastable nature. NMR spectroscopy has been extensively used in this research because it is shown to be an ideal technique for the elucidation of structures and dynamics in disordered systems. The complete “life-cycle” of the product is investigated; firstly, using solid-state NMR, a thorough and detailed analysis of the hydrogels are presented. The thermal stability of the hydrogels are then investigated by means of short and long term ageing effects, which shows that the product crystallises into the layered silicate makatite.

40|$|In modern-day architecture, {{large glass}} facades often define {{the skin of}} prestigious {{buildings}}. When these buildings are considered a target for terroristic attack, great care is required in the structural design as to saveguard human life. Above all, the window components need to be considered, since glass shard debris is {{the main cause of}} injury in any urban impact event. Typically, laminated glass panes are used in blast <b>resistant</b> <b>glazing</b> systems. These consist of 2 glass plies, bonded together by one or more polymer interlayers to retain glass fragments upon fracture. The efficiency of a laminated glass against impact loading depends on a number of factors: ply thicknesses, viscoelastic properties of the interlayer material and bonding strength between layers. The frame connection also plays an important role. Ideally, the window should remain in its frame without glass fragments being propulsed and without tearing of the interlayer. Then the questions are: - How and when does the glass fracture? - How are the fragments kept together by the interlayer? - How much of the impact energy can be dissipated by the window without causing danger to humans? Or practically, up to which load is a glazing panel able to withstand the attack? It may be clear that destructive testing is a complex and expensive manner to assess the applicability of a structural wall configuration. Computer simulation offers a tool that can save time and costs, and the possibility to gain a deeper insight in the quantification of the main failure mechanisms: brittle cracking, delamination, interlayer tearing and frame connection failure. Our aim is to develop a numerical modelling technique for laminated glass under impact and blast loads, validated by laboratory experiments.

40|$|A low-clay {{version of}} fine {{translucent}} china {{was designed to}} have desired properties and acceptable behaviour during manufacture. Low-clay contents of 10 to ISw/o were employed to reduce the deterious effects of preferential clay particle alignment and its adverse effect on colour. For example, alignment of clay particles in cast wares causes anisotropic drying and firing shrinkages and these cause distortion. Replacing clay with a pre fired body with low Fe and Ti contents, as in the present case, allowed a very white material to be produced. The prefired body was made with calcium carbonate, aluminium trihydroxide, quartz and a small fluxing addition of an hydrated magnesIUm carbonate. Desification of a whiteware is enhanced by increasing volume fraction of the viscous liquid and reducing by its viscosity. Both of these also enhance sagging. Consequently, compositional change cannot on its own lead to the favourable combination of high density, required to give translucency, with little sagging, that will allow wares to be fired without significant distortion. It was found by trail and error that use of finer particles reduced the sagging occurring in the densification heat treatment and enhanced densification. This finding allowed the body to be designed so that it densified without sagging excessively. After establishing this important result, an iterative approach was employed to produce a ware that was very white, translucent, had the required thermal expansion coefficient for glaze fitting, shrank acceptably during the first firing and did not sag during the second firing that stimulated glost firing. The finding on sagging was applied to an anorthite/mullite porcelain body that was under development. This body was also made with a low-clay content and the same prefired body. This whitware has potential to replace bone china and hard porcelain {{for use in the}} servere service conditions of hotels and restaurants. It has a higher fracture toughness than hard porcelain but has the same scratch <b>resistant</b> <b>glaze</b> and is more resistant to thermal shock.

This was achieved by using a combination of finer particles and a reduction in the liquid-phase content that developed during firing...|$|R

40|$|Annealed {{glass is}} by far the most {{commonly}} used glazing material in building construction. The <b>resistant</b> properties of <b>glazing</b> panels to wind loading has been studied for a long time based on quasistatic modeling. More recently, the vulnerability of infrastructure and its protection against acts of terrorism has been receiving a great deal of attention, as pioneered by the work of Wu and Hao from within Australia, whereas vulnerability studies by Stewart were specific to glass facades in terrorism scenarios. Emphasis has been on modeling the blast induced pressure and impulses, as they are applied to the panels while the resistant properties of the glazing materials have been based on assumptions used currently in design. Research undertaken by the writers over the past two to three years have revealed scopes of possible improvements to the current models that have been used in defining the <b>resistant</b> properties of <b>glazing</b> materials. Models based on the well known Weibull distribution, although widely assumed in practice, have been found to be not fully consistent with evidence produced experimentally or by analytical simulations. The interaction of the principal stresses surrounding the crack tip and higher mode effects have also been found to have significant effects on the ultimate behavior of the panel. The accurate modeling of these phenomena is particularly important for large panels. This paper provides an update of the redevelopment of a realistic behavioral model for annealed glazing panels subject to impact action.

40|$|The first {{approach}} utilises a {{thin film}} of acrylic that is moulded onto the outside of a polycarbonate substrate. It {{was found that the}} gate of the injection mould cavity must be of uniform cross section otherwise local shear heating can occur and melt the acrylic film. The injection gate must also be located entirely {{on one side of the}} mould cavity otherwise the film is punctured by the molten polycarbonate and free to float within the cavity. Any mixing of the two materials will lead to opaque components due the difference in the refractive indices. The film was found to improve the UV resistance of any component, acting as a protective buffer for the polycarbonate. A new variety of hardcoat was applied to film-backed samples to impart abrasion resistance and samples were found to outperform commercially available alternatives under recognised laboratory conditions. The film-backed samples also exhibited excellent impact resistance when impacted upon the film-face. However, similar components failed at extremely low energy levels when impacted from the non-film face because flaws in the acrylic film caused cracks to be initiated when the film was placed into tension. The level of adhesion between the film and the polycarbonate has been found to be critical and if the failure mechanism could be guaranteed, then intruder <b>resistant</b> <b>glazing</b> that could be broken from the inside in an emergency becomes a possibility. Such a product would address the identified consumer concern of being trapped in a vehicle. The second approach utilises simultaneous dual injection moulding (2 K), which has previously only been used to manufacture coloured components. A successful feasibility study was undertaken to demonstrate the concept of producing transparent components via such a process. This showed that much greater control is required for transparent applications otherwise the skin and core materials mix and opaque components are produced. The generally accepted academic principles associated with the process have been shown to be too simplistic and cannot be relied upon to guarantee good results. The ratio of viscosities of the skin and core materials appear to be more dominant than previously thought and the relative injection speeds of the two materials has a direct influence upon interfacial mixing and haze generation. It was also found that haze could be avoided if the refractive indices of the skin and core material were matched to within ± 0. 002, but this is impractical. A third area of research examined the feasibility of introducing structured glass fibres weaves into transparent components to improve rigidity. The study resulted in the construction of a transparent glass fibre pre-preg that could be moulded onto the outer surface of polycarbonate components. Flexural tests revealed that a single layer of glass fibre increased the flexural modulus of test samples by a factor of 3, whilst transparency and clarity were retained.

40|$|The author's {{approach}} to {{the problems associated with}} building in bushfire prone landscapes comes from 12 years of study of the biophysical and cultural landscapes in the Great Southern Region of Western Australia - research which resulted in the design and construction of the H-house at Bremer Bay. The house was developed using a 'ground up' approach whereby Dr Weir conducted topographical surveys and worked with a local botanist and a bushfire risk consultant to ascertain the level of threat that fire presented to this particular site. The intention from the outset however, was not to design a bushfire resistant house per se, but to develop a design which would place the owners in close proximity to the highly biodiverse heath vegetation of their site. The research aim was to find ways - through architectural design-to link the patterns of usage of the house with other site specific conditions related to the prevailing winds, solar orientation and seasonal change. The H-house has a number of features which increase the level of bushfire safety. These include: Fire rated roller shutters (tested by the CSIRO for ember attack and radiant heat), Fire <b>resistant</b> double <b>glazing</b> (on windows not protected by the shutters), Fibre-cement sheet cladding of the underside of the elevated timber floor structure, Manually operated high pressure sprinkler system on exposed timber decks, A fire refuge (an enlarged laundry, shower area) within the house with a dedicated cabinet for fire fighting equipment) and A low pressure solar powered domestic water supply system...|$|R
