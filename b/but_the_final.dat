5|$|Brown again guided Scotland to {{qualification}} {{for a major}} {{tournament in}} 1998, and Scotland were drawn against Brazil in the opening game of the 1998 World Cup. John Collins equalised from the penalty spot to level the score at 1–1, but a Tom Boyd own goal led to a 2–1 defeat. Scotland drew their next game 1–1 with Norway in Bordeaux, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> match against Morocco ended in an embarrassing 3–0 defeat.|$|E
5|$|England reached 3/106 by stumps on {{the fourth}} day, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> day started poorly when Compton edged the second ball of the day—bowled by Johnston—to a diving Miller at second slip; he knocked the ball upwards before falling {{on his back and}} {{completing}} the catch as the ball went down. Just as in the first innings, Compton’s dismissal precipitated a collapse, and Australia dismissed England for 186 to complete victory by 409 runs.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, the Spanish {{influenza}} epidemic {{forced the}} Montreal Canadiens and the Seattle Metropolitans to cancel their series, marking {{the first time}} the Stanley Cup was not awarded. The series was tied at 2–2–1, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> game was never played because Montreal Manager George Kennedy and players Joe Hall, Billy Coutu, Jack McDonald, and Newsy Lalonde were hospitalized with influenza. Hall died four days after the cancelled game, and the series was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|The Leopard2E {{replaced}} the Leopard2A4 in Spanish mechanized units, {{which in turn}} replaced M60s in cavalry units. Both versions of the Leopard 2 are expected to remain in service with the Spanish army until 2025. In terms of industrial scale, the production {{and development of the}} Leopard2E represents a total of 2.6million man-hours of work, including 9,600 in Germany. It {{is one of the most}} expensive Leopard 2s built; the original contract was worth €1,910m <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> cost was €2,399m.|$|E
5|$|The {{contract}} for the two ships was awarded to Tomlinson and Hartupee Co. on 16 May 1862. Construction was at their yard in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

5|$|The initial {{plan was}} to arm every fifth T-26 with the 37mm gun in the right turret, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> {{proportion}} was somewhat higher. About 450 twin-turreted T-26 mod. 1931 tanks mounting the 37mm gun in the right turret were produced in 1931–1933 (including only 20–30 tanks with the B-3 gun). There were 392 T-26 mod. 1931 tanks with gun plus machine gun armament in the Red Army on 1 April 1933.|$|E
5|$|The mansion was {{completed}} in 1914. Because McCreary was widowed before his second term in office, his granddaughter, Harriet Newberry McCreary, served as the mansion's first hostess during her summer vacations from her studies at Wellesley College. When Harriet McCreary was away at college, McCreary's housekeeper, Jennie Shaw, served as hostess. McCreary authorized the state to sell the old mansion at auction, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> bid of $13,600 was rejected as unfair by the mansion commission.|$|E
5|$|The song {{at the end}} of the show, {{written by}} Ken Keeler, is a parody of various Bond themes. Keeler {{originally}} wrote it to be three seconds longer and sound more like the Goldfinger theme, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> version was shorter and the lyrics were sped up. The writers wanted the song to be sung by Shirley Bassey, who sang several Bond themes, but they could not get her to record the part.|$|E

5|$|A popular Congressman {{and former}} Army officer, Hayes was {{considered}} by Ohio Republicans {{to be an}} excellent standard-bearer for the 1867 election campaign. Hayes's political views were more moderate than the Republican party's platform, although he agreed with the proposed amendment to the Ohio state constitution that would guarantee suffrage to black male Ohioans. Hayes's opponent, Allen G. Thurman, made the proposed amendment {{the centerpiece of the}} campaign and opposed black suffrage. Both men campaigned vigorously, making speeches across the state, mostly focusing on the suffrage question. The election was mostly a disappointment to Republicans, as the amendment failed to pass and Democrats gained a majority in the state legislature. Hayes thought at first that he, too, had lost, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> tally showed that he had won the election by 2,983 votes of 484,603 votes cast.|$|E

The latter position allowed him to travel across Bolivia. At {{the end of his}} higher education he failed to collect his degree certificate. Although interested in studying journalism, he did not pursue it as a profession.|$|E
5|$|Halo: Uprising is a four-issue American {{comic book}} limited series {{set in the}} Halo universe.

Uprising tells a story set between {{the ending of the}} 2004 video game Halo 2 and the beginning of its sequel, Halo 3, as Earth is under attack by a collective of alien races known as the Covenant. The series was intended to be released and concluded before Halo 3 shipped on September 25, 2007, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> issue did not appear until April 2009.|$|E

5|$|Hardenbergh's {{design was}} {{described}} as employing both Gothic elements and classical forms that preceded the extreme eclecticism that was to mark a later Victorian Gothic Revival period. The original plans called for the building to be constructed out of red brick, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> execution was mostly in sandstone quarried in Connecticut, with some examples of stone from Newark. Geology Hall, built {{on the south side}} of Old Queens, was the second of three projects that Hardenberg designed for the college, following an addition to a building (now Alexander Johnston Hall) that housed the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School) the year before. The third project, Kirkpatrick Chapel (1873), was designed to complement the simple Gothic Revival style of Geology Hall and was erected on the north side of Old Queens.|$|E
5|$|Political {{opposition}} in Congress {{also made it}} difficult to build the Pennsylvania-class. The House of Representatives refused to fund any new battleships for the fiscal year 1913, though the Senate would fund two in its comparable bill. They eventually compromised on one, and the battleship that would become Pennsylvania was authorized on 22 August 1912. The ship's plans were given to prospective builders on 20 December; bids were opened on 18 February 1913; and the contract was awarded to the lowest bidder, Newport News, on 27 February 1913 at the quoted price of $7,260,000 without armor or armament. The independent bidding process led the navy to claim $750,000 in savings, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> cost actually came in at $7,800,000 ($15,000,000 with armor and armament).|$|E
5|$|The poem is an elegy in {{name but}} not in form; it employs a style {{similar to that of}} {{contemporary}} odes, but it embodies a meditation on death, and remembrance after death. The poem argues that the remembrance can be good and bad, and the narrator finds comfort in pondering the lives of the obscure rustics buried in the churchyard. The two versions of the poem, Stanzas and Elegy, approach death differently; the first contains a stoic response to death, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> version contains an epitaph which serves to repress the narrator's fear of dying. With its discussion of, and focus on, the obscure and the known, the poem has possible political ramifications, but it does not make any definite claims on politics to be more universal in its approach to life and death.|$|E

5|$|The school vacated {{the entire}} 199293 season and every game it played from the 199596 season through the 199899 season. This {{included}} the 1997 National Invitation Tournament title and the 1998 Big Ten Tournament title. It also vacated its two Final Four games in 1992 and its entire NCAA tournament record in 1993, 1996 and 1998. There {{is a difference}} between forfeiting a game and vacating a game; a vacated game does not result in the other school being credited with a win. This included virtually the entire career of Fisher's successor, Brian Ellerbe. However, it did not include all games that Webber played or was eligible because all <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> two games of his freshman year were retained.|$|E
5|$|Wissenburg and Schlosberg's {{workshop}} {{formed the}} basis of Political Animals and Animal Politics, a collection edited by Wissenburg and Schlosberg, with earlier versions of many of the volume's chapters having being presented at that time. Originally, the editors had intended to have discussion of political theory, of movements for animals and of real-world politics, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> volume was somewhat more theory-based than this. Political Animals and Animal Politics was published in 2014 by Palgrave Macmillan in hardback format; {{it is part of the}} Palgrave Macmillan Animal Ethics Series, which is edited by Andrew Linzey and Priscilla Cohn. This interdisciplinary series aims to explore the practical and conceptual challenges posed by animal ethics.|$|E
5|$|Another wealthy family, the Eccles, {{commissioned}} Arrington {{to write}} a biography of David Eccles, a millionaire who helped form the industrial economy in Utah. David Eccles was a polygamist, and the descendants of his two wives, Bertha Jensen in Ogden and Ellen Stoddard in Logan, did not agree about how the biography should be written. Nora Harrison from the Logan {{part of the family}} originally commissioned the biography, but did not own enough material for the necessary research. Cleone Eccles, David's daughter-in-law from the Ogden side of the family, wanted a biography that focused on only positive things about David Eccles, while Harrison wanted a professional, scholarly work. In order to access Cleone Eccles's collection of David Eccles's manuscripts, Harrison agreed to give Cleone the right to make alterations to the text. Arrington employed JoAnn Bair to do the research and first drafts of the work. Harrison was unhappy with the manuscript and paid their neighbor and writer Wallace Stegner to critique the manuscript; his 15-page guidelines advised the writer to engage the reader through cliffhangers, flashbacks, and speculation. Stegner also found the manuscript too gentle on David Eccles's fraudulent business dealings. To appease Harrison, Arrington had Maureen Ursenbach Beecher improve the manuscript's literary style, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>final</b> biography still lacked real criticism of Eccles's business practices.|$|E
