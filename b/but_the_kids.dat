500|$|During 2014, {{speculation}} about Mitt Romney staging a third presidential run increased. [...] Ann Romney's {{reaction was to}} say it would not happen: [...] "Done. Completely. Not only Mitt and I are done, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> are done. Done. Done. Done." [...] However, like her husband, she left open the slight possibility that things could change in this regard, and by January 2015 was reported by Romney advisors to be supporting the possibility as he seriously considered a third presidential bid. [...] In any event, he soon decided against making a run.|$|E
500|$|Like {{her debut}} album, Kesha worked with some {{previous}} producers and writers that {{worked with her}} on her first album, such as: Dr. Luke, Ammo, Benny Blanco and Max Martin. Unlike her debut album though, Kesha {{enlisted the help of}} producer Bangladesh. She explained the reason for enlisting his help was that she wanted to [...] "add a tougher edge to her music". She said that the message she wanted to put out through this album was to create [...] "good, positive, [...] music". She elaborated, [...] "I feel like I’m creating this hopefully very youthful and irreverent movement of the kids, of like adolescence. I feel like the parents don’t get it, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> get it. And they deserve to have more good, positive music.” ...|$|E

He then wins several major pots from Howard, who is visibly losing confidence.|$|R
60|$|The trouble {{began in}} Laredo. It was <b>the</b> Llano <b>Kid's</b> fault, for {{he should have}} {{confined}} his habit of manslaughter to Mexicans. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> was past twenty; and to have only Mexicans to one's credit at twenty is to blush unseen on the Rio Grande border.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{comment from}} Kramer is that Perry unwittingly [...] "screwed up men's tennis in England, {{although}} this wasn't his fault. The {{way he could}} hit a forehand—snap it off like a ping-pong shot—Perry was a physical freak. Nobody else could be taught to hit a shot that way. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> over there copied Perry's style, and it ruined them. Even after Perry faded out of the picture, the coaches there must have kept using him as a model." ...|$|E

5000|$|Buddy, a lone guitarist and swordsman, saves {{an unnamed}} boy he simply calls [...] "Kid" [...] {{from a group}} of bandits; consequently, as <b>the</b> <b>Kid's</b> mother was killed by the bandits, he tags along with Buddy. As the duo travel through the desert wasteland, the heavy metal-playing Death stages several {{attempts}} to prevent Buddy from reaching Lost Vegas alive and claim the throne for himself. After enduring a host of opponents such as a bounty-hunting bowling team, a cannibalistic suburban family, a band of underground mutants, and the Red Army, an injured Buddy squares off against Death in a sword fight. Death mortally wounds Buddy, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> discovers water is Death's weakness after spitting at him. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> then melts Death away with a canteen full of water. Buddy's lifeless body disappears, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> puts on his clothes and glasses before continuing his journey toward Lost Vegas.|$|R

Jarrett tried to use this to his advantage by using the Figure Four leglock, <b>but</b> <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> blocked <b>the</b> hold by using a small package to pin Jarrett for the victory. Upset at being eliminated from the tournament, Jarrett responded by performing three piledrivers on <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> after <b>the</b> match.|$|R

50|$|Now it's {{clear that}} the bandit who killed the {{previous}} marshal and his deputies is a fake.

60|$|The {{man whom}} he had shot was a {{stranger}} to him. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> {{knew that he was}} of the Coralitos outfit from Hidalgo; and that the punchers from that ranch were more relentless and vengeful than Kentucky feudists when wrong or harm was done to one of them. So, with the wisdom that has characterized many great fighters, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> decided to pile up as many leagues as possible of chaparral and pear between himself and the retaliation of the Coralitos bunch.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>Kid,</b> whose fall had jolted {{and bruised}} him, was {{inclined}} to be wrathful and vindictive. He {{was the first of}} the three to reach the elusive Mr. Repetto, and if that worthy had happened to be standing instead of sitting it might have gone hard with him. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> was not <b>the</b> man to attack a fallen foe. He contented himself with brushing the dust off his person and addressing a richly abusive flow of remarks to Mr. Repetto.|$|R
6000|$|He began {{describing}} <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> who {{was still}} asleep in the cab. I did some quick thinking.

Yes, I had seen <b>the</b> <b>kid.</b> I had met him first in Ogden. The date tallied with <b>the</b> sheriff's information. <b>But</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> was still behind somewhere, I explained, for he had been ditched from that very overland that night when it pulled out of Rock Springs. And all the time I was praying that <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> wouldn't wake up, come down out of the cab, and put the [...] "kibosh" [...] on me.|$|R

50|$|The town's rough {{reputation}} drew {{a number}} of lawless characters. Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> passed through in 1879, as did Jesse James, though neither was ever {{a part of the}} gang. A local legend has the two famous outlaws meeting for dinner in the Old Adobe Hotel in nearby Hot Springs, New Mexico. Supposedly Jesse invited Billy to come to Missouri and join his gang <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> declined. However, that is generally viewed as legend, and it is not confirmed that the two ever even met.|$|R

[...] He bends over, supposing that his admirer {{will give him}} <b>the</b> soda, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> refuses, saying: [...] "Don't even think about it!" [...] Suddenly, a sound simulating that of a scratched record is heard, and the commercial ends with the Pepsi logo and slogan.|$|R
5000|$|Both parties {{end up in}} San Diego, <b>but</b> <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> gets {{separated}} from Tobin when he is caught by local authorities and imprisoned.

After reaching through the cell bars to try to touch <b>the</b> <b>kid,</b> Holden leaves <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> alone, stating that he [...] "has errands."

60|$|In fact, Mason {{suffered}} {{least of}} all, for {{he spent his}} time in eastern Tennessee, in the Great Smoky Mountains, living over the scenes of his childhood. And most pathetic was the melody of his long-forgotten Southern vernacular, as he raved of swimming holes and coon hunts and watermelon raids.
