40|$|Tinnitus is {{a common}} but poorly {{understood}} disorder characterized by ringing or <b>buzzing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ear.</b> Central mechanisms must {{play a crucial role}} in generating this auditory phantom sensation as it persists in most cases after severing the auditory nerve. One hypothesis states that tinnitus is caused by a reorganization of tonotopic maps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> auditory cortex, which leads to an over-representation of tinnitus frequencies. Moreover, the participation of <b>the</b> limbic system <b>in</b> generating tinnitus has been postulated. Here we aimed at identifying brain areas that display structural change in tinnitus. We compared tinnitus sufferers with healthy controls by using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging and voxel-based morphometry. Within the auditory pathways, we found gray-matter increases only at the thalamic level. Outside the auditory system, gray-matter decrease was found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subcallosal region including the nucleus accumbens. Our results suggest that reciprocal involvement of both sensory and emotional areas are essential <b>in</b> <b>the</b> generation of tinnitus...|$|R
50|$|Hypertension {{is rarely}} {{accompanied}} by symptoms, and its identification is usually through screening, or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem.

These symptoms, however, might be related to associated anxiety rather than the high blood pressure itself.|$|R
50|$|Less often, {{people with}} Chiari {{malformation}} may experience ringing or <b>buzzing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> (tinnitus), weakness, slow heart rhythm, or fast heart rhythm, {{curvature of the}} spine (scoliosis) related to spinal cord impairment, abnormal breathing, such as central sleep apnea, characterized by periods of breathing cessation during sleep, and, in severe cases, paralysis.|$|E
30|$|Cognitive perceptual {{disruption}} (CPD). A person experiencing CPD {{will become}} confused or blank in their thoughts and/or will have disturbances {{in one or}} more of their senses when experiencing anxiety (e.g., tunnel vision, blurred vision, ringing or <b>buzzing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears).</b> Visual disturbances are most common (Davanloo 1995 b). Physically, the person will appear relaxed as anxiety is not being expressed in the striated muscles, but will manifest confused thinking and not be “present” in the room. Chronic cognitive perceptual disruption is associated with neurological complaints (for which no medical cause can be found) including dizziness and fainting.|$|E

25|$|The {{most obvious}} symptom of {{macropsia}} {{is the presence}} of exceptionally enlarged objects throughout the visual field. For example, a young girl might see her sister’s books as the same size as her sister. Stemming from this symptom, someone with macropsia may feel undersized in relation to his or her surrounding environment. Patients with macropsia have also noted the cessation of auditory function prior to the onset of visual hallucination, indicating possible seizure either before or after the hallucination. A <b>buzzing</b> sound <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> has also been reported immediately before macropsia development. Some patients claim that symptoms may be eased if an attempt is made to physically touch the object which appears enormous in size. It is important to note, however, that patients typically remain lucid and alert throughout episodes, being able to recount specific details. A person with macropsia may have no psychiatric conditions. Symptoms caused chemically by drugs such as cannabis, magic mushrooms, or cocaine tend to dissipate after the chemical compound has been excreted from the body. Those who acquire macropsia as a symptom of a virus usually experience complete recovery and restoration of normal vision.|$|R

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis To {{evaluate}} the prevalence, characteristics, and associated {{risk factors of}} tinnitus in U. S. adolescents. Study Design Cross-sectional analyses of U. S. representative demographic and audiometric data, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005 to 2008. Methods The study population consisted of 3, 520 individuals aged 12 to 19 years with complete tinnitus-related data. Tinnitus {{was defined as the}} presence of ringing or <b>buzzing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> lasting for at least 5 minutes during the preceding 12 months. In addition, we defined a chronic tinnitus subgroup as being bothered by tinnitus for more than 3 months. Demographic and other data regarding tinnitus, smoking, body mass index (BMI), anemia, hypertension, history of ear infections, tympanostomy tube placement, otoscopy, tympanometry and hearing thresholds, history of firearm use, and recreational and occupational exposure to noise were extracted and analyzed. Results Overall, tinnitus lasting 5 minutes or more in the preceding 12 months was reported by 7. 5 % of the 12 - to 19 -year-old population. This represents about 2. 5 million adolescents in the United States. The prevalence of chronic tinnitus was 4. 7 %, corresponding to about 1. 6 million adolescents in the United States. Multivariable-adjusted analysis revealed that both overall and chronic tinnitus were associated with female gender, low income, exposure to passive smoking, type A tympanogram, and occupational and recreational noise exposure. History of ≥ 3 ear infections and history of tympanostomy tube placement were associated only with overall tinnitus. Conclusions Tinnitus afflicts {{a substantial portion of the}} youth population. Further investigation of the association between tinnitus and the identified risk factors is warranted. Level of Evidence N/A.

40|$|Tinnitus is the {{perception}} of sound (e. g. tones, <b>buzzing,</b> or ringing) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ears</b> or head when no corresponding external sound stimuli are present. Around a quarter of adults experience tinnitus {{at any one time}} (Shargorodsky et al, 2010). It is diffi cult to measure objectively, and is typically subjectively rated by patients according to the diffi culty it imposes (e. g. disruption with sleep, and/or normal daily activities). Although tinnitus is often comorbid with hearing loss, the perceived severity of tinnitus is more closely correlated with psychological factors than with audiometric measures (Erlandsson et al, 1992). Research on the risk factors associated with tinnitus suggests that severity is associated with anxiety and depression symptoms amongst others. Holgers and colleagues (Holgers et al, 2005) conducted stan-dardized diagnostic interviews for psychiatric diagnosis, including anxiety and depression (based on DSM III-R) of 82 patients two years after the fi rst tinnitus consultation. They found a high comorbidit...|$|R

Persistent tinnitus was reduced with: (i) fish consumption (non-oily, OR =  0. 91; oily, 0. 95), (ii) egg avoidance (OR =  0. 87) and (iii) caffeinated coffee consumption (OR =  0. 99 per cup/day). Reports of “bothersome” tinnitus (moderate-severe handicap) reduced with wholemeal/wholegrain bread intake (OR = 0. 86) [corrected]. Reports of less frequent transient tinnitus increased with dairy avoidance (OR =  1. 18) and decreased with caffeinated coffee (OR =  0. 98 per cup/day) and brown bread (OR =  0. 94). This is the first population study to report the association between dietary factors and tinnitus. Although individually dietary associations are mostly modest, particular changes in diet, such as switching between foodstuffs, may result in stronger associations. These findings offer insights into possible dietary associations with tinnitus, and this may be useful when discussing management options in combination with other lifestyle changes and therapies...|$|R
6000|$|Much that {{happened}} in these years can be unraveled back to Harley, Earl of Oxford. His influences and circuitous dealing emerge wherever a close examination of politics is made.[1] Hiding his activities from even his closest associates, employing spies and journalists whose purposes seem contradictory, manipulating the House of Commons' radical October Club while preaching a [...] "broad bottomed" [...] moderate government, and <b>buzzing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Queen's <b>ear</b> <b>in</b> a variety of ways, Harley was ready for any exigency. England had wanted peace since 1709 when their insistence on [...] "no peace without Spain" [...] and on the XXXVII Article asking for guarantees of three Spanish towns had rallied the French behind the war;[2] Marlborough's pleas that peace be made and Spain be dealt with later were ignored. Although Parliament voted Malplaquet a triumph, Marlborough's power and prestige were systematically shorn away, and embarrassing decisions contrived to force his resignation were effected.[3] Should Marlborough resign, a scapegoat for defeat or an unfavorable peace would be assured. By 1710, foreign policy had changed--a growing interest in trade and colonization urged Parliament to end a costly and now unnecessary war and had united the Tories, Jacobites, the Church party, as well as such diverse men as the Dukes of Argyll, Somerset, Newcastle, and Shrewsbury, a Whig. With {{the election of the}} radical Tory majority (240 new members were seated) to <b>the</b> Commons <b>in</b> 1710 and <b>the</b> creation of twelve new peers,[4] Harley's job of using diverse elements to form a moderate government became more complex. He found it expedient to establish and maintain influence with groups ranging from the radical Tory October Club to Swift's country squire and clergy Examiner readers to moderate Whigs such as Shrewsbury. Moreover, Defoe had impressed upon him the importance of assuring the nation that moderate and sensible men were at the bottom of all of the political changes.[5] Harley, therefore, prepared for at least three apparently exclusive possibilities--prosecuting the war for several more years, negotiating a peace with the Allies, or making a separate peace with France without the Allies. To keep all these possibilities alive, Harley had to remain in harmony with Marlborough. The general's popularity with the soldiers and the European powers and France's awe of his military prowess necessitated the appearance that Marlborough's command was secure. While the Examiner, with its Tory audience and its emphasis on pressure for peace, was essential to Harley, so were Swift's and Defoe's appeals for moderation at a time when sympathy for Marlborough was rampant and the call [...] "no peace without Spain" [...] was still defended even by the October Club; for the same reasons he was glad to have Bolingbroke openly associated with the Examiner.|$|R
