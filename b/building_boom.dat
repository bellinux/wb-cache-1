5|$|The {{original}} {{portion of}} the building opened in 1904, when the tower portion was completed two decades later, {{it was one of}} the tallest reinforced concrete buildings in the world, and the tallest in the United States. Dayton went through an early <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> in the late 1920s, during which several high-rise buildings, including the Key Bank Building, were constructed. The city experienced a second, much larger <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> that lasted from the early 1970s to late 1980s. During this time, Dayton saw the construction of six skyscrapers, including the Kettering Tower and KeyBank Tower.|$|E
5|$|Bellevue's {{history of}} skyscrapers {{began with the}} {{completion}} of the Paccar Tower in 1970; this structure is regarded as the city's first high-rise. High-rise building construction remained slow until 1982, when the city's first skyscraper <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> took shape. Eight of the city's 24 tallest buildings were completed within the next seven years, including City Center Bellevue, which was the tallest building in Bellevue for almost two decades. The skyscraper construction boom ended in 1989, and subsequently only one high-rise which ranked among the city's tallest structures was completed in the 1990s. Beginning in 2000, Bellevue entered into a second, much larger <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> that continued to 2010. More than half of Bellevue's twenty tallest buildings were completed after 2000; nine projects were completed in 2008 alone, including Bellevue Towers. Overall, Bellevue's skyline is ranked third in the Pacific Northwest of the United States, after Seattle and Portland.|$|E
5|$|In 1979, before {{construction}} {{had even}} begun, there was {{opposition to the}} construction of Trump Tower and other buildings in the area. The New York Committee for a Balanced <b>Building</b> <b>Boom</b> was concerned about the planned rezoning of the area that would arise due {{to the construction of}} high-rise towers along Fifth Avenue between 40th and 57th Streets.|$|E
50|$|There {{were three}} <b>building</b> <b>booms</b> within the district: 1888 to 1893, 1902 to 1915, and 1919 to 1929. Nearly 80 {{percent of the}} homes were built prior to 1930.|$|R
50|$|The Singer Building is a 3-story {{commercial}} structure {{located at}} 1514 Elm Street in the Main Street District in Downtown Dallas, Texas. The structure {{is one of}} a handful of original early commercial structures along Elm Street; many others were demolished and replaced by large office blocks during various <b>building</b> <b>booms.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Building</b> <b>booms</b> {{in later}} {{half of the}} twentieth century gave the city a larger base of {{contemporary}} architectural styles, including a number of buildings by famed architect Bruce Goff, who lived in Tulsa. South, East and Midtown Tulsa are also home to a number of ranch and Mid-Century Modern homes that reflect Tulsa's prosperous post-war period.|$|R
5|$|Projects in the United States {{during the}} late 1940s allowed Raymond to gain a {{foothold}} in occupied Japan. This helped to restart the <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> in occupied Japan after the war. This was mainly achieved through contacts made in his previous practice and those that he and Rado made in New York.|$|E
5|$|Architects were HRTB and {{the main}} {{contractor}} was NCC Construction. While domed stadiums have been common in North America, no such stadiums of comparable size of Telenor Arena had previously been built for football in Europe. Construction started by demolishing a hangar, which was completed in February 2007. However, because of the <b>building</b> <b>boom,</b> concrete elements needed for construction to start meant {{that the rest of}} the construction was delayed. The cornerstone was laid on 5 September.|$|E
5|$|During the late-1980s office <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> in the West Market Street area of Center City, {{businesses}} {{left the}} Fidelity Building for newer office space. As a result, the building's owners filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 1992. That same year, the Fidelity Building Corporation {{was purchased by}} First Fidelity Bankcorp, a company formed in the 1988 merger of the building's original owners and First Fidelity Corporation of Newark, New Jersey.|$|E

5|$|It was {{originally}} {{known as the}} McKernan Block, after John W. McKernan, the building's original financier, owner, and manager. McKernan was already a recognized theatre operator having previously run two other south side theatres before the Princess: the south side Gem and the South Side Bijou. Only the Princess was to survive the collapse of Strathconaâ€™s <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The newest of Manor Hall's annexes was {{originally}} {{a row of}} spacious townhouses constructed in the 1780s {{as part of the}} <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> of Clifton in between wars with France. 30-35 Richmond Terrace was a hotel prior before being acquired by the University in 2006. The building underwent a major refurbishment and it now provides self-catered en suite accommodation for 92 students. It was previously managed by University Student Houses and became a Manor Hall annexe in 2012.|$|E
5|$|A <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> in {{the early}} 20th century gave Tulsa {{one of the largest}} {{concentrations}} of art deco architecture in the United States. Most commonly in the zigzag and streamline styles, the city's art deco is dotted throughout its older neighborhoods, primarily in downtown and midtown. A collection of large art deco structures such as the Mid-Continent Tower, the Boston Avenue Methodist Church, and the Philtower, have attracted events promoting preservation and architectural interest. In 2001, Tulsa served as the host city for the International Art Deco Congress, a semiannual event designed to promote art deco architecture internationally.|$|E
5000|$|In 1831, as {{the city}} {{continued}} to expand, the University of the City of New York, now New York University, was founded at Washington Square in Greenwich Village. In 1832 came {{the first of a}} series of cholera epidemics. [...] By 1835, with the epidemic past, Manhattan was in the throes of the first of its <b>building</b> <b>booms.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lime working {{had been}} carried out at Snodland for centuries, but {{expanded}} dramatically in the 19th century, as <b>building</b> <b>boomed.</b> The firm of Poynder and Medlicott began quarrying on the Snodland-Halling border in the early 19th century and the company {{was taken over by}} William Lee in 1846. Others followed and the last one was built in 1923 by W L H Roberts at Holborough. Lime for building Waterloo and other London bridges came from the area.|$|R
50|$|The {{village was}} largely {{destroyed}} in the Thirty Years' War and reconstruction efforts were subsequently thwarted when the village was once again burned during the Palatine war of succession. Kirchheim repopulated slowly, with 350 people in 1766 and 2,000 in 1861. The building of a station on the Rhine Valley Railway in 1865 brought industry to the village. In 1920 Kirchheim was annexed to Heidelberg at which point <b>building</b> <b>boomed</b> and the population swelled to 8,000.|$|R
5|$|Architecture of Scotland in the Industrial Revolution {{includes}} all building in Scotland between the mid-eighteenth {{century and the}} end of the nineteenth century. During this period, the country underwent an economic and social transformation as a result of industrialisation, which was reflected in new architectural forms, techniques and scale of building. In the second half of the eighteenth century, Edinburgh was the focus of a classically inspired <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> that reflected the growing wealth and confidence of the capital. Housing often took the form of horizontally divided tenement flats. Some of the leading European architects during this period were Scottish, including Robert Adam and William Chambers.|$|E
5|$|Shanghai's first <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> {{occurred}} in the 1920s and 1930s, during the city's heyday as a multinational center of business and finance. The city's international concessions permitted foreign investment, and with it came architectural styles from the West, as seen today {{in areas such as}} the French Concession and the Bund. After the Communist takeover in 1949 the city's development was stifled, punished for its earlier capitalist excesses. After economic reforms beginning in the 1980s, the city is undergoing its second construction boom to fulfill its desire to regain its status as an important global financial center.|$|E
5|$|The Tree Streets is {{a network}} of streets in the Mount Pleasant portion of the village. Several of the streets are named after {{regional}} trees, including Satinwood Lane, Larch Road, and Oak Road. A number of houses in the neighborhood were constructed during a 1930s <b>building</b> <b>boom,</b> circling Jackson Park and near Todd Elementary School. The Crossroads {{is a group of}} 84 houses on streets named after local World War II veterans, including Schrade Road, Hazelton Circle, Matthes Road, and Dunn Lane. It was constructed at the end of World War II to provide affordable housing to returning veterans, and was completed in 1952.|$|E

5000|$|While the {{rebuilding}} by the Wide Streets Commission fundamentally changed the streetscape in Dublin, a property boom led to additional building outside the central core. Unlike twentieth century <b>building</b> <b>booms</b> in Dublin {{the eighteenth century}} developments were carefully controlled. The developing areas were divided into precincts, each of which was given to a different developer. The scope of their developments were restricted, however, with strict controls imposed on style of residential building, design of buildings and location, so producing a cohesive unity {{that came to be}} called Georgian Dublin.|$|R
50|$|Ammon was {{an early}} {{agricultural}} center and later was home to several general stores, a grain elevator and a brickyard. The city was officially incorporated on October 10, 1905. It became a Second Class City under Idaho law in 1963. In the early 1900s a spur line was built by the Eastern Idaho Railroad to the Ammon Elevator. Beginning in the 1940s housing divisions have aided the city's growth {{and it has become}} a suburb for the adjacent city of Idaho Falls. <b>Building</b> <b>boomed</b> in the 1990s in both the business and housing sectors, and the city was {{one of the fastest growing}} in Idaho from 2000 to 2010.|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} was originally {{known as the}} McKernan Block, after John W. McKernan, the Princessâ€™s owner and manager until 1919. The McKernans were a family of property developers in boomtown Strathcona; Johnâ€™s father developed and ran the historically important Dominion Hotel, also on Whyte Avenue. For his part, J.W. McKernan is considered an important trailblazer in Edmonton entertainment. He opened two other south side theatres before the Princess, the South Side Gem and the South Side Bijou, both of which failed during the collapse of Strathcona's <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> in 1913.|$|E
5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling. The skewed malefemale ratio is probably an artifact of the differential between male and female lifespans in Lithuania (male average lifespan in Lithuania was 66 years in 2004, as against 78 for females), according to the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosperity}} stimulated a <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> {{that was}} underway by the mid-1830s, {{with the building}} {{of some of the}} most elaborate structures the city had seen up to that point. This was cut short in part by the Panic of 1837 and yellow fever epidemics. The waterfront was developed with wharves, terminal facilities, and fireproof brick warehouses. The exports of cotton grew in proportion to the amounts being produced in the Black Belt; by 1840 Mobile was second only to New Orleans in cotton exports in the nation.|$|E
40|$|This article {{develops}} an equilibrium {{framework for}} strategic option exercise games. The author {{focuses on a}} particular example: the timing of real estate development. An analysis of the equilibrium exercise policies of developers provides insights into the forces that shape market behavior. The model isolates the factors that make some markets prone to bursts of concentrated development. The model also provides an explanation for why some markets may experience <b>building</b> <b>booms</b> {{in the face of}} declining demand and property values. While such behavior is often regarded as irrational overbuilding, the model provides a rational foundation for such exercise patterns. Copyright 1996 by American Finance Association. ...|$|R

5|$|Bellaire's {{population}} had reached 1,124 in 1940. After 1940, Bellaire had a rapid population {{explosion in the}} post-World War II <b>building</b> <b>boom.</b> On December 31, 1948, the city of Houston had annexed the land around the city of Bellaire, stopping the city of Bellaire's land growth. Bellaire remained independent of Houston; Bellaire adopted a home rule charter with a council-manager government in April 1949. By 1950 the city's residents had numbered 10,173, and there were 3,186 houses. However each subsequent {{year for the next}} two years, an additional 600 to 700 new houses opened. Due to the resulting population increase, several schools, including Bellaire High School, Marion High School, and two elementary schools, were established in that period, and Condit Elementary received a new addition. In the 1960s 250 houses in Bellaire were demolished {{to make way for the}} right of way of the 610 Loop, which bisected the city.|$|E
5|$|Davenport {{experienced}} {{an economic and}} <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> in the 1920s and early 1930s. The Kahl Building and the Capitol Theatre, the baseball stadium, the Parker Building, and the Blackhawk Hotel {{are a few of}} the buildings built during this time period that are still standing. The Great Depression brought economic tough times to the city. The inclusion of new factories in the 1940s and 1950s helped turn the economy around after World War II. Davenport was on hard times once again with the farm crisis of the 1980s, when the Caterpillar Plant closed, costing 35,000 jobs. The city was rejuvenated once again in the 1990s and present by renovations and building additions.|$|E
5|$|Los Angeles (and {{especially}} Downtown) {{then went}} through a large <b>building</b> <b>boom</b> that lasted from the early 1960s to the early 1990s, during which time the city saw the completion of 30of its 32tallest buildings, including the U.S. Bank Tower, the Aon Center, and Two California Plaza. Modern skyscrapers are difficult and expensive to construct in Los Angeles due to the city's high rate of earthquakes and position near the San Andreas fault line, {{as well as the}} resulting difficulty of adhering to the city's rigorous engineering standards. Nevertheless, a number of successful and iconic skyscrapers dot the Los Angeles skyline from Downtown Los Angeles through Koreatown. Along the Wilshire Corridor, Miracle Mile and Century City areas of the cities westside. Other skyscraper hubs are hotels on Century Boulevard by LAX, the Hollywood district in central L.A.

50|$|The railway made {{possible}} the export of St Bees sandstone. Huge amounts of stone were quarried, much of it for <b>building</b> the <b>boom</b> town of Barrow-in-Furness. This industry died out in the 1970s, but has since been revived, and there are now two working quarries in the parish.|$|R
50|$|In 1958, General Development Corporation, a {{subsidiary}} of Mackle Brothers, bought {{tens of thousands of}} acres of land along the St. Lucie River {{in the southern part of}} the county in order to build a new community. Colorful and clever advertising soon drew thousands of northeastern retirees and families to the area, laying the foundation for the future city of Port St. Lucie. Population and <b>building</b> <b>booms</b> in the late 20th century led to the formation of other areas west and south of Port St. Lucie including St. Lucie West and the new master planned community of Tradition. The early 21st century brought many trials for the county including two major hurricanes in 2004 and an economic and housing slump starting in 2008. In 2005, St. Lucie County celebrated its 100th birthday.|$|R
