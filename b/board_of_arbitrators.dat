60|$|It is Criticism, again, that, by concentration, makes culture possible. It {{takes the}} {{cumbersome}} mass of creative work, and distils {{it into a}} finer essence. Who that desires to retain any sense of form could struggle through the monstrous multitudinous books {{that the world has}} produced, books in which thought stammers or ignorance brawls? The thread that is to guide us across the wearisome labyrinth {{is in the hands of}} Criticism. Nay more, where there is no record, and history is either lost, or was never written, Criticism can re-create the past for us from the very smallest fragment of language or art, just as surely as the man of science can from some tiny bone, or the mere impress of a foot upon a rock, re-create for us the winged dragon or Titan lizard that once made the earth shake beneath its tread, can call Behemoth out of his cave, and make Leviathan swim once more across the startled sea. Prehistoric history belongs to the philological and archaeological critic. It is to him that the origins of things are revealed. The self-conscious deposits of an age are nearly always misleading. Through philological criticism alone we know more of the centuries of which no actual record has been preserved, than we do of the centuries that have left us their scrolls. It can do for us what can be done neither by physics nor metaphysics. It can give us the exact science of mind in the process of becoming. It can do for us what History cannot do. It can tell us what man thought before he learned how to write. You have asked me about the influence of Criticism. I think I have answered that question already; but there is this also to be said. It is Criticism that makes us cosmopolitan. The Manchester school tried to make men realise the brotherhood of humanity, by pointing out the commercial advantages of peace. It sought to degrade the wonderful world into a common market-place for the buyer and the seller. It addressed itself to the lowest instincts, and it failed. War followed upon war, and the tradesman's creed did not prevent France and Germany from clashing together in blood-stained battle. There are others of our own day who seek to appeal to mere emotional sympathies, or to the shallow dogmas of some vague system of abstract ethics. They have their Peace Societies, so dear to the sentimentalists, and their proposals for unarmed International Arbitration, so popular among those who have never read history. But mere emotional sympathy will not do. It is too variable, and too closely connected with the passions; and a <b>board</b> <b>of</b> <b>arbitrators</b> who, for the general welfare of the race, are to be deprived of the power of putting their decisions into execution, will not be of much avail. There is only one thing worse than Injustice, and that is Justice without her sword in her hand. When Right is not Might, it is Evil.|$|E

40|$|When {{proceeding}} to {{conclude a contract}} trading partners usually hope that their Joint agreement will be executed without any major disturbances and both sides will be - fully satisfied. In practice, however, disputes between the sides to a contract often arise. It is only a relatively small group of causes that contains an elenent of forco majeure in it, that is to say their occurrence does not depend on man's will to any extent whatsoever, while all the others result generally from negligence, recklessness, or human fallibility. This group of causes was submitted to a more detailed analysis. Thus, for example, at the stage of preparing and negotiating a contract it may happen that an incomplete offer has been submitted, the quality of goods has not been negotiated precisely, or an error has been made in the content of a contract or {{in the form of an}} arbitration clause contained in it. More various errors could be distinguished at the stage of a direct execution of a trade agreement, e. g. a failure to send a shipping Instruction on time, typing errors, unpunctual payments, wrong packaging of goods and others.
