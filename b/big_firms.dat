25|$|Corruption {{often leads}} to many civil {{services}} being treated by governments as employment agencies to loyal supporters and so it could mean going through 20 procedures, paying $2,696 in fees and waiting 82 business days to start a business, in Bolivia, while, in Canada, it takes two days, two registration procedures, and $280 to do the same. Such costly barriers favor <b>big</b> <b>firms</b> {{at the expense of}} small enterprises, where most jobs are created. Often, businesses have to bribe government officials even for routine activities, which is, in effect, a tax on business.

500|$|Tesla's {{demonstration}} of his induction motor and Westinghouse's subsequent licensing of the patent, both in 1888, {{came at the}} time of extreme competition between electric companies. The three <b>big</b> <b>firms,</b> Westinghouse, Edison, and Thompson-Houston, were trying to grow in a capital intensive business while financially undercutting each other. There was even a [...] "War of Currents" [...] propaganda campaign going on with Edison Electric trying to claim their direct current system was better and safer than the Westinghouse alternating current system. Competing in this market meant Westinghouse would not have the cash or engineering resources to develop Tesla's motor and the related polyphase system right away.|$|E

30|$|Several {{empirical}} {{studies have found}} significant evidence {{that there is a}} positive relationship between company size and the level of social and environmental disclosure (Brammer and Pavelin 2006; Cowen et al. 1987; Gray et al. 1995; Hackston and Milne 1996; Patten 2002, Patten 1992; Zeng et al. 2012). These studies argued that <b>bigger</b> <b>firms</b> are visible and exposed because of their size and image. Larger firms are, therefore, more willing to disclose environmental information to please their enormous stakeholders. Moreover, they are likely to seek capital externally and so disclose environmental information to alter societal perception. Again <b>bigger</b> <b>firms</b> are more prone to disclose environmental information than smaller firms to avoid punitive measures from regulators and reduce risk of regulation (Burgwal and Vieira 2014). Brammer and Pavelin (2008) study quality of voluntary disclosures in UK’s industrial sector and analysed the determinants of disclosure. They find that <b>bigger</b> <b>firms</b> and nature of activities influence quality of disclosures.|$|R
40|$|Business history allows {{throwing}} {{light on}} great movements of economy and their origin. The contributions {{of this sort}} of history are numerous: the part of scale saving, diversification, scale progress. The vision of technical progress by historians nourishes also a lot of models of endogenous growth. A pure microeconomic process can bring forward a representativity problem, the focus being put generally on success stories and <b>big</b> <b>firm</b> stories. A macroeconomic dimension is necessary for establishing major facts. If distortions between two dimensions are frequent, convergences take on, as the works of Alfred Chandler an Michael Porter show it. They both agree on determining part of innovation dynamics, but the second, unlike the first, rejects the superiority of the <b>big</b> <b>firm</b> to the advantage of the impulsion effect of the creation of new firms.

60|$|Cheyenne County was an {{enormous}} expanse of hilly plain, if the two words may be used together. Low heights of sharp ascent, pyramid-shaped buttes, and wide benches (cut here and there by small creek valleys) made up its surface, which, broadly considered, was only the vast, treeless, slowly-rising eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains. At long distances, on the flat, sandy river, groups of squat and squalid ranch buildings huddled as if to escape the wind. For years {{it has been a}} superb range for cattle, and up till the coming of the first settlements on the Cannon Ball, it had been parceled out among a few <b>big</b> <b>firms,</b> who cut Government timber, dug Government stone, and pastured on Government grass. When the wolves took a few ponies, the ranchers seized the opportunity to make furious outcry and bring in the Government troops to keep the Indians in awe, and so possessed the land in serenity.

Part I describes some of the aspects of <b>big</b> <b>firm</b> practice that make it particularly difficult to integrate religious and personal values which may give meaning to one 2 ̆ 7 s work. Part II suggests that such meaning can be found through a religious vision of what it means to be a person, which includes a sense of obligation to serve the common good. Part III explores how this concept might interface with the ideals, duties and culture of the legal profession. Part IV extends this analysis to the context of a practice that serves big business. Finally, Part V ponders how such a notion may be applied in the specific context of a <b>big</b> <b>firm</b> litigation practice. The Essay concludes with hope that the profession will make room for the substantive contribution that lawyers with religious vision of the human person and of the common good can bring to the public discourse and the practice of law, even in the context of a <b>big</b> <b>firm</b> practice...|$|R
