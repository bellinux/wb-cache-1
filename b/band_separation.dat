50|$|Unlike {{traditional}} dial-up modems, which modulate bits into {{signals in}} the 300-3400 Hz baseband (voice service), DSL modems modulate frequencies from 4000 Hz to {{as high as}} 4 MHz. This frequency <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> enables DSL service and {{plain old telephone service}} (POTS) to coexist on the same copper pair facility. On the subscriber's end of the circuit, inline low-pass DSL filters (splitters) are installed on each telephone to filter the high-frequency signals that would otherwise be heard as hiss, but pass voice frequencies. Conversely, high-pass filters already incorporated in the circuitry of DSL modems filter out voice frequencies. Although ADSL and RADSL modulations do not use the voice-frequency band, nonlinear elements in the phone could otherwise generate audible intermodulation and may impair the operation of the data modem in the absence of high-pass filters.|$|E

40|$|Linear-assisted {{switchers}} {{are based}} on the idea of combining high efficiency of switching converters with wide-bandwidth capabilities of linear amplifiers. Such linear-assisted switching power converters have been proposed for implementation of wide-bandwidth envelope-tracking power supplies for RF power amplifiers in polar modulation architectures. This paper presents modeling of the overall linear-assisted switcher efficiency {{as a function of the}} <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> frequency between the signals processed by the switching and the linear parts. The efficiency model, which is based on the statistical amplitude distributions of the signals, is used to derive the optimum <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> frequency to maximize the overall efficiency.

40|$|The V-band {{systems have}} been widely used in the {{aerospace}} industry for securing spacecraft inside the launch vehicle payload fairing. Separation is initiated by firing pyro-devices to rapidly release the tension bands. A significant shock transient is expected {{as a result of the}} <b>band</b> <b>separation.</b> The shock environment is defined with the assumption that the shock events due to the <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> are associated with the rapid release of the strain energy from the preload tension of the restraining band. This paper discusses the pyroshock characteristics and environments based on various test measurements conducted on several JPL spacecraft programs. Different from previous assumptions, the measurements show that shock at the payload interface is generated primarily by high-speed impacts between the spacecraft and the V-band after separation. Shock levels will be attenuated much quicker with distance since this shock source is a point contact rather than a linear distributed source as assumed...|$|E
40|$|The DMT {{transceivers}} {{have enjoyed}} great success in high speed data transmission. The DMT scheme is realized by a transceiver that divides the frequency selective channel into {{a set of}} frequency nonselective parallel subchannels. The efficiency of the scheme depends on the frequency selectivity of the transmitting and receiving filters. In the past, the filterbank transceiver has been proposed as an implementation of DMT transceiver that has better frequency <b>band</b> <b>separation.</b> But usually ISI can not be completely cancelled in these filterbank transceivers and additional equalization is required. In this paper, we show how to obtain zeroforcing cosine modulated filterbank transceivers by introducing cyclic prefix at the transmitter. The proposed systems have the advantages of having good frequency separation and simple equalization. ISI can easily be elimination by exploiting the cyclic prefix and good frequency <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> is attained {{through the use of}} cosine modulated filter banks. 1...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Basing on {{the results}} of {{computer}} simulations, {{it will be possible to}} choase proper technological parameters for the slitting rollers (such as shape), which will assure the slitting of the band and verify the force parameters. Design/methodology/approach: Using FEM-based computer programs for solving the problems of the theory of plasticity enables determining the force parameters during the <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> and enabled also the determination of the tools abrasive wear. Findings: Longitudinal <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> depends on the shape of the used slitting rollers. Increasing the roller opening angle has an effect on the force parameters and on the tools abrasive wear. Practical implications: The use of commercial software applications in the design of process technologies will allow for the development of a multi slit rolling technology with a minimum number of laboratory and industrial trials. Originality/value: Using the cracking (element removal) algorithm implemented in the Forge 3 ® program, it was possible to carry out the numerical modiling of the proces for rolling with band slitting...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The Rainbow Signature Scheme is a non-trivial {{generalization}} {{of the well}} known Unbalanced Oil and Vinegar (UOV) signature scheme (Eurocrypt ' 99) minimizing {{the length of the}} signatures. By now the Rainbow <b>Band</b> <b>Separation</b> attack is the best key recovery attack known. For some sets of parameters it is even faster than a direct attack on the public key. Unfortunately the available description of the attack does not provide deep insights. In this article we provide another view on the Rainbow <b>Band</b> <b>Separation</b> attack using the theory of equivalent keys and a new generalization called good keys. Thereby we generalize the attack into a framework that also includes Reconciliation attacks. We further formally prove the correctness of the attack and show that it also performs well on all multivariate quadratic (MQ) schemes that su er from missing cross-terms. We apply our attack to break the MFE encryption scheme based on Diophantine equations, the Enhanced STS signature scheme and all its variants, as well as the MQQ Encryption and Signature schemes. In the case of Rainbow and Enhanced TTS we show that parameters have to be chosen carefully and that the remaining e ciency gain over UOV is small...|$|E

40|$|Animal colour signals used in intraspecies {{communications}} can {{generally be}} attributed to a composite effect of structural and pigmentary colours. Notably, the functional role of iridescent coloration that is ‘purely ’ structural (i. e., absence of pigments) is poorly understood. Recent studies reveal that iridescent colorations can reliably indicate individual quality, but evidence of iridescence as a pure structural coloration indicative of male quality during contests and relating to an individual’s resource-holding potential (RHP) is lacking. In age- and size-controlled pairwise male-male contests that escalate from visual displays of aggression to more costly physical fights, we demonstrate that the ultraviolet-green iridescence of Cosmophasis umbratica predicts individual persistence and relates to RHP. Contest initiating males exhibited significantly narrower carapace <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> (i. e., relative spectral positions of UV and green hues) than non-initiators. Asymmetries in carapace and abdomen brightness influenced overall contest duration and escalation. As losers retreated upon having reached their own persistence limits in contests that escalated to physical fights, losers with narrower carapace <b>band</b> <b>separation</b> were significantly more persistence. We propose that the carapace UV-green iridescence of C. umbratica predicts individual persistence and is indicative of a male’s RHP. As the observed UV-green hues of C. umbratica are ‘pure ’ optical products of a multilayer reflector system, we suggest that intrasexual variations in the optical properties of the scales ’ chitin-air-chitin microstructures are responsible for the observed differences in carapace band separations...|$|E
