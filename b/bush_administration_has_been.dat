5000|$|Several {{publications}} {{compared the}} political {{context of the}} Clone Wars to the War in Iraq. In claiming that the Star Wars galaxy under the deceitful Palpatine parallels the modern issues of the United States, an editorial on Antiwar.com states that Star Wars [...] "establishes first the generally agreeable premise that it's right to overthrow oppressive government, before bringing into focus something more discomforting - that the corrupt tyranny referred to is our own". Additionally, an article from Wiretap claims that [...] "like Palpatine, the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> able to feed on people's fears to gain more power". Lucas stated that the Iraq conflict [...] "didn't exist" [...] when he developed the Clone Wars, but he did see parallels between the Vietnam conflict that inspired Star Wars and the conflict in Iraq.

5000|$|In February 2004, the UCS {{received}} press {{attention for}} its publication [...] "Scientific Integrity in Policymaking". The report criticized {{the administration of}} U.S. President George W. Bush for [...] "politicizing" [...] science. Some of the allegations include altering information in global warming reports by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and choosing members of scientific advisory panels based on their business interests rather than scientific experience. In July 2004, the UCS released an addendum to the report in which they criticize the Bush administration and allege that reports on West Virginia strip mining had been improperly altered, and that [...] "well-qualified" [...] nominees for government posts such as Nobel laureate Torsten Wiesel were rejected because of political differences. On April 2, 2004, Dr. John Marburger, {{the director of the}} White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, issued a statement claiming that incident descriptions in the UCS report are [...] "false," [...] "wrong," [...] or [...] "a distortion", and dismissed the report as [...] "biased". UCS rebutted the White House document by saying that Marburger's claims were unjustified. UCS later wrote that since that time, the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> virtually silent on the issue.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> {{accused of}} {{implementing}} an industry-formulated disinformation campaign designed to actively mislead the American public {{on global warming}} and to forestall limits on [...] "climate polluters", {{according to a report}} in Rolling Stone magazine that reviews hundreds of internal government documents and former government officials. The book Hell and High Water asserts that there has been a disingenuous, concerted and effective campaign to convince Americans that the science is not proven, or that global warming is the result of natural cycles, and that there needs to be more research. The book claims that, to delay action, industry and government spokesmen suggest falsely that [...] "technology breakthroughs" [...] will eventually save us with hydrogen cars and other fixes. It calls on voters to demand immediate government action to curb emissions. Papers presented at an International Scientific Congress on Climate Change, held in 2009 under the sponsorship of the University of Copenhagen in cooperation with nine other universities in the International Alliance of Research Universities (IARU), maintained that the climate change skepticism that is so prevalent in the USA [...] "was largely generated and kept alive by a small number of conservative think tanks, often with direct funding from industries having special interests in delaying or avoiding the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions".|$|E

Investigative reporter Seymour Hersh reported in 2006 that the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>had</b> <b>been</b> planning the use of nuclear weapons against Iran. When specifically questioned about the potential use of nuclear weapons against Iran, President Bush claimed that [...] "All options were on the table."

5000|$|On May 19, 2007, Blair {{made his}} final visit to Iraq before {{stepping}} down as British Prime Minister, and Carter criticized him afterward. Carter told the BBC that Blair was [...] "apparently subservient" [...] to Bush and criticized {{him for his}} [...] "blind support" [...] for the Iraq war. Carter described Blair's actions as [...] "abominable" [...] and stated that the British Prime Minister's [...] "almost undeviating support for the ill-advised policies of President Bush in Iraq {{have been a major}} tragedy for the world." [...] Carter said he believes that had Blair distanced himself from the Bush administration during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, it might have made a crucial difference to American political and public opinion, and consequently the invasion might not have gone ahead. Carter states that [...] "one of the defenses of the <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> ... <b>has</b> <b>been,</b> okay, we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because Great Britain is backing us. So I think the combination of Bush and Blair giving their support to this tragedy in Iraq has strengthened the effort and has made the opposition less effective, and prolonged the war and increased the tragedy that has resulted." [...] Carter expressed his hope that Blair's successor, Gordon Brown, would be [...] "less enthusiastic" [...] about Bush's Iraq policy.|$|E

40|$|During {{his tenure}} as President, George W. Bush has pushed a {{domestic}} policy agenda that strongly advocates reducing the burdens on business, allegedly caused by regulations that have been deemed too punitive and too expensive by the Administration and its allies. This policy shift has taken place within most agencies responsible for administering social and economic regulation, but environmental regulation {{has been the most}} salient and visible example of the Administration’s attempt to roll back enforcement activities. In particular, administration officials have spent much time trying to rewrite the New Source Review rules under the Clean Air Act, specifically to ensure that power plants and other energy concerns would not have to spend potentially billions on anti-pollution control when they upgrade their facilities. With strong efforts like these, to make regulation more business-friendly, it is natural to expect that enforcement activities in the EPA would decline during the Bush Administration. However, this conclusion may be premature, given previous research on this subject. Our primary interest in this paper is to determine whether the <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> successful, through the use of subtle means of presidential power, in rolling bac...|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{addresses}} {{the policies of}} the Bush Administration, and the damage that it has done to the cause of democracy and human rights worldwide. But I have to start out by saying that, in certain respects, the Bush Administration’s record of attempting to promote human rights is very good. That is, the <b>Bush</b> <b>Administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> as outspoken as any previous administration in championing human rights {{in different parts of the}} world. It has been willing to take quite strong action in efforts to promote human rights. We have the example in 2004 of Secretary of State Colin Powell’s decision to label what is taking place in Darfur in the Sudan as “genocide, ” which implies a responsibility under the Genocide Convention to prevent genocide and to punish those who are responsible for genocide. It contrasts with the Clinton Administration’s stand a decade earlier in Rwanda, where the Administration danced around but refused to use the label genocide in a much clearer case than the case in the Sudan.

The current <b>Bush</b> <b>administration</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> a period of inertia in terms of advancing new controls, but this {{is largely due to}} the administration being distracted by the War on Terror. During his campaign for the presidency in 2000, Bush favored extending the “assault-weapons ” ban of 1994 that sunsets on September 13, 2004. Should George Bush lose the election, {{there are more than a}} few politicians in his party who will gladly join the certain effort of a John Kerry administration to renew the assault-weapons ban. Although the September 11, 2001 terror attacks in the U. S. triggered a wave of gun buying among the American public, the federal government remains determined to stop the advance of gun freedoms in any areas it directly controls, despite significant pressure to desist in the interest of more effective security. It has, for instance, deliberately dragged its feet on allowing airline pilots to be armed, despite the fact that there is significant support among pilots and the public for allowing pilots to be armed.
