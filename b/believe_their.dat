5|$|The sea {{still remains}} {{a venue for}} {{recreational}} boating and large cruise ships. It is also a route for refugees and economic migrants, some traveling in small unseaworthy craft and others smuggled into shipping vessels.

5|$|Back in Washington, both Scully and Mulder {{report to}} Section Chief McGrath, {{who does not}} <b>believe</b> <b>their</b> claims. McGrath offers an {{especially}} harsh reprimand to Mulder, and presents written testimony by Henderson claiming that Max's {{body was found in}} a cargo container. McGrath and his disciplinary board decide to shut down the X-Files and dismiss Mulder from the FBI, but the decision is vetoed by Deep Throat, who feels it would be more dangerous for them to allow Mulder to turn whistleblower than to let him continue his work.|$|E
50|$|The Mesopotamians <b>believed</b> <b>their</b> {{kings and}} queens were descended from the City of Gods, but, unlike the ancient Egyptians, they never <b>believed</b> <b>their</b> kings were real gods. Most kings named {{themselves}} “king of the universe” or “great king”. Another common name was “shepherd”, as kings had to look after their people.|$|R

5|$|In general, Uyghurs and {{the mostly}} Han {{government}} disagree on which group has greater historical {{claim to the}} Xinjiang region: Uyghurs <b>believe</b> <b>their</b> ancestors were indigenous to the area, whereas government policy considers present-day Xinjiang to have belonged to China since around 200BC. According to PRC policy, Uyghurs are classified as a National Minority rather than an indigenous group—in other words, they {{are considered to be}} no more indigenous to Xinjiang than the Han, and have no special rights to the land under the law. The People's Republic has presided over the migration into Xinjiang of millions of Han, who dominate the region economically and politically.|$|E
5|$|Most of Final Fantasy IV {{takes place}} on Earth, {{also known as the}} Blue Planet, which {{consists}} of a surface world (or Overworld), inhabited by humans, and an underground world (or Underworld), inhabited by the Dwarves. An artificial moon orbits the planet, upon which the Lunarians live. The Lunarians are a race of beings originally from a world which was destroyed, becoming the asteroid belt surrounding the Blue Planet, and are identified by a moon-shape crest on their foreheads. They created the artificial moon, resting until a time when they <b>believe</b> <b>their</b> kind can co-exist with humans. A second, natural moon orbits the Blue Planet as well, although it is never visited in the game.|$|E
5|$|Peter Donovan criticises the language-games {{approach}} {{for failing to}} recognise that religions operate in a world containing other ideas and that many religious people make claims to truth. He notes that many religious believers not only <b>believe</b> <b>their</b> religion to be meaningful and true in its own context, but claim that it is true against all other possible beliefs; if the language games analogy is accepted, such a comparison between beliefs is impossible. Donovan proposes that debates between different religions, and the apologetics of some, demonstrates that they {{interact with each other}} and the wider world and so cannot be treated as isolated language games.|$|E

Among those using the Internet, 39 percent had protected their online accounts, for example by changing passwords or canceling accounts; 29 percent <b>believed</b> <b>their</b> personal information was put at risk because of the Heartbleed bug; and 6 percent <b>believed</b> <b>their</b> personal information had been stolen.|$|R

5|$|Seeing {{their leader}} fall, the Loyalists began to surrender. Some Patriots {{did not want}} to take prisoners, as they were eager to avenge the Battle of Waxhaws or 'Tarleton's Quarter,' in which Banastre Tarleton's forces killed a sizable number of Abraham Buford's Continental {{soldiers}} after the latter tried to surrender. (At Waxhaws, Tarleton's horse was shot, pinning him to the ground and leading his men to <b>believe</b> <b>their</b> commanding officer had been killed under a white flag of surrender.) Also, other Patriots were seemingly unaware that the Loyalists were trying to surrender.|$|E
5|$|Negron, in a {{flashback}} tells of his war {{experiences as a}} young corporal of the segregated 92nd Infantry Division in Italy in 1944. A disastrous attack ensues on German positions across the Serchio River. An officer, Captain Nokes, calls down artillery on the 92nd's own position, refusing to <b>believe</b> <b>their</b> reports of how far they have advanced. Many American soldiers are killed, leaving Negron stranded {{on the wrong side}} of the river with three men: Staff Sergeant Aubrey Stamps, Sergeant Bishop Cummings, and Private Sam Train. Sam carries the Head of the Primavera that he found in Florence, which he believes to carry magical powers. Sam and Bishop rescue an Italian boy named Angelo from a collapsing building. While traveling through the mountains of Tuscany, the soldiers enter a small village, where they form a bond with the residents. Sam grows especially fond of Angelo, becoming the boy's father figure. One Italian villager, Renata, soon becomes entangled in a love triangle with Stamps and Bishop, which creates conflict.|$|E
5|$|TGS head writer Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) is {{assigned}} to solve a public relations problem caused by the show's stars, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) and Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), during their hosting duties of the St. Patrick's Day parade, in which Jenna passed out and Tracy cursed during the live television broadcast. To make things worse, Liz is summoned to jury duty and cannot avoid it despite claiming to be Princess Leia. When she leaves for jury duty, she does not leave anyone in charge and allows the staff to go without direction—until later when she puts NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) in charge after learning that the staff {{have gotten out of}} hand. Liz is on a court case about a woman, named Rochelle Gaulke (Jackie Hoffman), whose work life and frustrations parallel her own; the two both have employees named Tracy and Jenna, both <b>believe</b> <b>their</b> employees waste their time, and make their lives difficult.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the beliefs that patients with advanced cancer held about the curability of their cancer, their use of alternatives to conventional medical treatment, and their need to have control over decisions about treatment.

The index of need for control over treatment decisions was low in 53 patients (35. 6 %) and high in only 17 patients (11. 4 %).
