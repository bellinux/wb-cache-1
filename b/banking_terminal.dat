40|$|An {{embedded}} Crypto-Biometric {{authentication scheme}} for ATM banking systems is proposed in our paper. In this scheme, cryptography and biometric techniques are fused together for person authentication to ameliorate the security level. The fingerprint template including singular points, frequency of ridges and minutiae are stored {{at the central}} banking server when enrollment. At the time of transaction fingerprint image is acquired at the ATM terminal using high resolution fingerprint scanner. The fingerprint image is enhanced and then encrypted using 128 bit private key algorithm. The encrypted image is transmitted to the central server via secured channel. At the <b>banking</b> <b>terminal</b> the image is decrypted using the same key. Based on the decrypted image, minutiae extraction and matching are performed to verify the presented fingerprint image belongs to the claimed user. The authentication is signed if the minutiae matching are successful. The proposed scheme is fast and more secure. Computer simulations and statistical analysis are presented...|$|E

40|$|The {{computing}} {{industry has}} {{passed through a}} rapid se-quence of technological phases: central computingwith mainframes (1950 s through the 1980 s), personalcomputers (1980 s to present), and computer networks (1990 s to present). A fourth era is now emerging—as comput-ers become ubiquitous, technology more noticeable by its absence than its presence [1], [5], [10], [17], [20]. This article discusses intelligent sen-sor environments and pervasive computer architectures that {{may be able to}} support a new generation of information appliances. Mass-produced computing devices are starting to appear. The Clarion AutoPC provides integrated communications, computing, navi-gation, car control, and an entertainment system [7]. The NCR Mi-crowave Oven/Home <b>Banking</b> <b>Terminal</b> and the Electrolux Internet Connected Screen Fridge hint at home management [16]. Electric servo appliances are also examples of pervasive tech-nology [3], [6]. The average North American home contains two dozen or more electric motors. A multitude of sensors gather the information needed to control them. Because they are all buried inside many appliances (vacuum cleaners, mi-crowave ovens, refrigerators, VCRs, etc.), we have difficulty identifying them, and we actually don’t care where or how many there are {{as long as they do}} their jobs. In the future, the same will be true with computers, most of which will be hidden in infor-mation appliances [17]. These new appliances are “smart devices ” em-bedded with microprocessors that al-low users to plug into intelligent networks and gain direct, simple, and secure access to both relevant information and services. These devices are as simple to use as calculators, tele-phones, or toasters. Pervasive computing envisions the “net...|$|E

The main contribution of the architecture is an infrastructure-centric approach to the trigger management problem.

New weapons and technologies can be purchased here using Brouzouf, the game's form of currency, which is earned by killing enemies, completing objectives, or hacking <b>bank</b> <b>terminals.</b> The Temple also contains many characters to speak to, a training room for testing weapons, multiple mobile armories where the player's currently available equipment can be loaded and armor changed, a medical section where new cybernetic abilities can be purchased, and an archive room where the history of the in-game universe can be learned through the use of data terminals, and where new psionic powers can be purchased. The Temple also features an armory where new weapons can be bought, which can then be equipped using the mobile armories. The Temple can be accessed at any time by choosing the Temple option at the game's loading screen, or in the escape menu, which pauses the current mission. Side missions can be acquired from Temple guard at its entrance, or the player can simply take a Temple exit to enter the local streets and see randomly generated objectives, battle various enemies, hack <b>bank</b> <b>terminals,</b> etc., to earn Brouzouf and experience, and to find new technologies.|$|R

50|$|Mission {{objectives}} are largely nonlinear, with several objectives generally highlighted at once, {{and it is}} up to the player in which order to pursue them. Some objectives also have several different options for completion. Side missions can be picked up at the Temple by speaking to various characters, or by speaking to secondary characters in-mission and agreeing to perform tasks for them, which usually results in earning more Brouzouf. Levels are open for exploration, so objectives can even be ignored if the player desires to simply go exploring and kill enemies or hack <b>bank</b> <b>terminals.</b> Note however that mission completion ends with certain player ratings based on how well the player adhered to the instructions of their commander, so if the commander indicated that objectives must be completed quickly, level exploration could incur rating penalties.|$|R

Hacking is done wirelessly and does not require direct contact or even line-of-sight. Each hacking target has cyberspace stats indicating how difficult {{it will be to}} hack, as does the player—an attempted hack also opens the player to possible counter-hacks. The hacking menu shows targets in the vicinity, and the player has a number of virus upload options to choose from, clicking {{from one to the other}} in order to attempt to gain access, including shield, which buffs the player's cyberspace defense stat, and attack, which lowers the target's defense. Hacked enemy drones will work for the player, <b>bank</b> <b>terminals</b> offer Brouzouf, and hacked enemy characters offer the player a view from their perspective, and can be moved and made to attack other enemies.

A User Interface Management System (UIMS) has been implemented which provides entire separation of application logic and its representation by means of XML and Java technologies. Customers can use their own optimized input and output utilities to interact with a remote image of the terminal interface displayed on the mobile device.
