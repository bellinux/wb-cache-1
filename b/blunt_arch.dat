5000|$|The Castelo de Linhares da Beira {{was built}} {{between the end}} of the XI Century and the early XII century. It is at an {{altitude}} of 820 meters and is Romano Gothic in architectural style. It is contained within two walled stone enclosures. It possesses two towers, the Keep and the Clock Tower, and four gates. The first gate contains a barrel vault; the second a round arch set into the side walls; the third a <b>blunt</b> <b>arch</b> in the wall separating the two enclosures and the fourth gate is known as the Traitors Gate.|$|E

We constructed the wave intensity (WI) images of unsmooth pulse based on the pressure wave (P), flow velocity wave (U), and WI [(dP/dt) (dU/dt) ] by ALOKA Prosound α 10 Color Doppler. The characteristic of Cunkou normal pulse could be summarized as follows: compared to Renying pulse, its W 1 amplitude is smaller and NA wave is more obvious, while the W 2 wave is indistinct or even invisible, and the R- 1 st is longer than that of Renying pulse. The principal U wave of Renying pulse looks like “Λ” shape, while it looks like an <b>arched</b> <b>blunt</b> “∩” shape in Cunkou pulse, and the amplitude of U wave in Cunkou pulse is smaller. The direction of the principal U wave in Cunkou unsmooth pulse is up, which shows hoof boots “h” shape with high amplitude and a significant notch on declined branch; the amplitude of predicrotic wave in unsmooth pulse P wave is significantly higher, which could be even higher than that of h 1, resulting in early appearance of h 3 or integrating with h 1, which forms a wide and blunt peak. Unsmooth pulse shows poorer vascular elasticity and greater vascular stiffness...|$|R
