All the main methods known for proving lower bounds on the monotone complexity of Boolean functions fail to work in their present form for slice functions.

40|$|The {{focus is}} in the {{development}} of more accurate and efficient advanced methods for solution of singular problems encountered in mechanics. At present, finite element methods in conjunction with special functions, <b>boolean</b> <b>sum</b> and blending interpolations are being considered. In dealing with systems which contain a singularity, special finite elements are being formulated to be used in singular regions. Further, special transition elements are being formulated to couple the special element to the mesh that models the rest of the system, and to be used in conjunction with 1 -D, 2 -D and 3 -D elements within the same mesh. Computational simulation with a least squares fit is being utilized to construct special elements, if there is an unknown singularity in the system. A novel approach is taken in formulation of the elements in that: (1) the material properties are modified to include time, temperature, coordinate and stress dependant behavior within the element; (2) material properties vary at nodal points of the elements; (3) a hidden-symbolic computation scheme is developed and utilized in formulating the elements; and (4) special functions and <b>boolean</b> <b>sum</b> are utilized in order to interpolate the field variables and their derivatives along the boundary of the elements.
