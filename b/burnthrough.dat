5000|$|During the Space Shuttle design process, a McDonnell Douglas {{report in}} September 1971 {{discussed}} the safety record of solid rockets. While a safe abort was possible after most types of failures, one was especially dangerous: a <b>burnthrough</b> by hot gases of the rocket's casing. The report stated that [...] "if <b>burnthrough</b> occurs adjacent to hydrogen/oxygen tank or orbiter, timely sensing {{may not be}} feasible and abort not possible", accurately foreshadowing the Challenger accident. Morton Thiokol was the contractor responsible for the construction and maintenance of the shuttle's SRBs. As originally designed by Thiokol, the O-ring joints in the SRBs were supposed to close more tightly due to forces generated at ignition, but a 1977 test showed that when pressurized water was used to simulate the effects of booster combustion, the metal parts bent away from each other, opening a gap through which gases could leak. This phenomenon, known as [...] "joint rotation," [...] caused a momentary drop in air pressure. This {{made it possible for}} combustion gases to erode the O-rings. In the event of widespread erosion, a flame path could develop, causing the joint to burst—which would have destroyed the booster and the shuttle.|$|E
5000|$|Several National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) {{satellites}} {{that only}} the shuttle could launch were grounded because of the accident, a dilemma NRO had feared since the 1970s when the shuttle was designated as the United States' primary launch system for all government and commercial payloads. NASA had difficulties with its own Titan rocket and Delta rocket programs, due to other unexpected rocket failures occurring {{before and after the}} Challenger disaster. On August 28, 1985, a Titan 34D [...] carrying a KH-11 Kennan satellite exploded after liftoff over Vandenberg Air Force Base, when the first stage propellant feed system failed. It was the first failure of a Titan missile since 1978. On April 18, 1986, another Titan 34D-9 carrying a classified payload, said to be a Big Bird spy satellite, exploded at about 830 feet above the pad after liftoff over Vandenberg AFB, when a <b>burnthrough</b> occurred on one of the rocket boosters. On May 3, 1986, a Delta 3914 carrying the GOES-G weather satellite exploded 71 seconds after liftoff over Cape Canaveral Air Force Station due to an electrical malfunction on the Delta's first stage, which prompted the range safety officer on the ground to decide to destroy the rocket, just as a few of the rocket's boosters were jettisoned. As a result of these three failures, NASA decided to cancel all Titan and Delta launches from Cape Canaveral and Vandenberg for four months until the problem in the rockets' designs were solved.|$|E
40|$|An 8 -kv {{electron}} beam with a current {{in the neighborhood}} of 100 mA from the Ukrainian space welding "Universal Hand Tool" (UHT) burned holes in Nextel AF- 62 ceramic cloth designed to withstand temperatures up to 1, 427 C. The <b>burnthrough</b> time was on the order of 8 scc at standoff distances between UHT and cloth ranging from 6 - 24 in. At both closer (2 in.) and farther (48 in.) standoff distances the potency of the beam against the cloth declined and the <b>burnthrough</b> time went up significantly. Prior to the test it had been expected that the beam would lay down a static charge on the cloth and be deflected without damaging the cloth. The <b>burnthrough</b> is thought to be an effect of partial transmission of beam power by a stream of positive ions generated by the high-voltage {{electron beam}} from contaminant gas in the "vacuum" chamber.

40|$|Iridium-coated rhenium {{provides}} {{long life}} operation of radiation-cooled rockets at temperatures up to 2200 C. Ceramic oxide coatings {{could be used}} to increase iridium/rhenium rocket lifetimes and allow operation in highly oxidizing environments. Ceramic oxide coatings promise to serve as both thermal and diffusion barriers for the iridium layer. Seven ceramic oxide-coated iridium/rhenium, 22 N rocket chambers were tested on gaseous hydrogen/gaseous oxygen propellants. Five chambers had thick (over 10 mils), monolithic coatings of either hafnia or zirconia. Two chambers had coatings with thicknesses less than 5 mils. One of these chambers had a thin-walled coating of zirconia infiltrated with sol gel hafnia. The other chamber had a coating composed of an iridium/oxide composite. The purpose of this test program was to assess the ability of the oxide coatings to withstand the thermal shock of combustion initiation, adhere under repeated thermal cycling, and operate in aggressively oxidizing environments. All of the coatings survived the thermal shock of combustion and demonstrated operation at mixture ratios up to 11. The iridium/oxide composite coated chamber included testing for over 29 minutes at mixture ratio 16. The thicker-walled coatings provided the larger temperature drops across the oxide layer (up to 570 C), but were susceptible to macrocracking and eventual chipping at a stress concentrator. The cracks apparently resealed during firing, under compression of the oxide layer. The thinner-walled coatings did not experience the macrocracking and chipping of the chambers seen with the thick, monolithic coatings. However, <b>burnthroughs</b> in the throat region did occur in both of the thin-walled chambers at mixture ratios well above stochiometric. The burn-throughs were probably the result of oxygen-diffusion through the oxide coating that allowed the underlying iridium and rhenium layers to be oxidized. The results of this test program indicated that the thin-walled oxide coatings are better suited for repeated thermal cycling than the thick-walled coating, while thicker coatings may be required for operation in aggressively oxidizing environments...|$|R
40|$|The {{destructive}} capabili @ of {{the beam}} power of some accelerators was dramatically demonstrated {{in a series of}} tests at SLXC using an 18 GeV e- beam at average powers ranging from 165 to 580 kW. The purpose of the expcri-ments was to examine a series of devices which simulated beam stoppers, protection collimators and <b>burnthrough</b> monitors as presently applied at SLAC. Specific attention was given to the recording of <b>burnthrough</b> times, tempera-ture behavior, and to the analy-sis of failure modes. A sum-mary of the test data is presented. The design of an exten-sive electronic system to prevent damage to mechanical devices and to detect onset of destruction is discussed. Var-ious sensors are connected to integrating and peak reading circuits to form power, beam verification and errant beam monitors. <b>Burnthrough</b> monitors shut down the accelerator if damage occurs to critical items.

40|$|This {{investigation}} was undertaken to evaluate if molten metal or electron beam impingement could damage or burn through {{the fabric of}} the astronauts Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) during electron beam welding exercises performed in space. An 8 kilovolt electron beam with a current in the neighborhood of 100 milliamps from the Ukrainian space welding "Universal Hand Tool" burned holes in Nextel AF- 62 ceramic cloth designed to withstand temperatures up to 1427 C. The <b>burnthrough</b> time was on the order of 8 seconds at standoff distances between UHT and cloth ranging from 6 to 24 inches.

40|$|A {{lightning}} flash {{consists of}} multiple, high-amplitude but short duration return strokes. Between the return strokes is a lower amplitude, continuing current which flows for longer duration. If {{the walls of}} a Faraday cage are made of thin enough metal, the continuing current can melt a hole through the metal in a process called <b>burnthrough.</b> A subsequent return stroke can couple energy through this newly-formed hole. This LDRD is a study of the protection provided by a Faraday cage when it has been compromised by <b>burnthrough.</b> We initially repeated some previous experiments and expanded on them in terms of scope and diagnostics to form a knowledge baseline of the coupling phenomena. We then used a combination of experiment, analysis and numerical modeling to study four coupling mechanisms: indirect electric field coupling, indirect magnetic field coupling, conduction through plasma and breakdown through the hole. We discovered voltages higher than those encountered in the previous set of experiments (on the order of several hundreds of volts) ...|$|E
40|$|The United States Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) {{recently}} developed new fire test criteria for aircraft thermal acoustical insulation. Aircraft insulation {{is attached to}} the fuselage structure to provide a noise and thermal barrier. Generally, the lightweight insulation blankets are comprised of fiberglass encased in a film bagging material. The new fire test criteria provide improvements in both postcrash fuel fire resistance and in-flight fire protection. Full-scale fire tests have shown that available fire-resistant blanket materials or fire barriers can significantly prolong the time for fuselage <b>burnthrough</b> and thereby provide additional time for passengers to survive a postcrash fuel fire. A new small-scale fire test method and criteria for insulation blanket <b>burnthrough</b> resistance has been developed and finalized. Similarly, intermediate- and full-scale fire tests were conducted to evaluate the behavior of the thin bagging material films during a hidden in-flight fire. It was observed that the films exhibit a range in fire behavior, depending on the chemical composition, thickness, and type of scrim (tear stopper).

Parameters which were measured included ignition time, <b>burnthrough</b> time, and physical damage to the cargo liner, composition of selected combustible gases, temperature-time histories, heat flux, and detector response.

The SXRI is a snout that mounts to a four strip gated imager. This produces four soft x-ray images per strip, which can be separated in time by {approx} 60 psec. Each soft x-ray channel consists of a mirror plus a filter. The diagnostic was used to study x-ray <b>burnthrough</b> of hot hohlraum targets at the NIF and OMEGA lasers.

The small-scale hohlraums, laser energy, laser pulse, and diagnostics were similar at both facilities but the geometries were very different. The NIF experiments used on-axis laser beams whereas the OMEGA experiments used 19 beams in three beam cones.

40|$|The {{subject of}} this paper is the {{presentation}} of flight data for three Terrier-Malemute II sounding rocket vehicles. The Malemute motor was modified by adding insulation and using a propellant that produced less Al 2 O 3 agglomerate in the chamber. This modification, designated Malemute II, reduced the sensitivity of the motor to the roll rate induced motor case <b>burnthrough</b> experienced on some earlier Malemute flights. Two flight tests, including a single stage Malemute II and a Terrier-Malemute II, were made by Sandia to qualify this modification.

40|$|The {{thesis is}} about the flame {{retardant}} optimization of carbon fiber reinforced fuselage structures {{in the event of}} a pool fire incident. For this purpose two general concepts, the use of glass formers on a laminate surface and intumescent agents in an intermediate layer, have been followed. Several flame retardants (FRs) have been chosen and tested in a preliminary test using FRs applied to a carbonepoxy prepreg laminate. From the three most promising FRs several samples were manufactured and analyzed in a four minute <b>burnthrough</b> test and a smoke density and toxicity test.

40|$|A terpolyimide {{precursor}} {{was developed}} {{which can be}} foamed by microwave methods and yields foams possessing the best seating properties. A continuous process, based on spray drying techniques, permits production of polyimide powder precursors in large quantities. The constrained rise foaming process permits fabrication of rigid foam panels with improved mechanical properties and almost unlimited density characteristics. Polyimide foam core rigid panels were produced by this technique with woven fiberglass fabric bonded to {{each side of the}} panel in a one step microwave process. The fire resistance of polyimide foams was significantly improved by the addition of ceramic fibers to the powder precursors.

40|$|Abstract — This paper treats {{modeling}} and {{control for the}} <b>burnthrough</b> point in industrial sintering processes. First, a simple state-space model for event-time dynamics is derived for a complicated system by introducing events into a continuous variable system. For {{the control of the}} sintering process, a twostage control policy is used. First, optimal interevent time is obtained from an output-constrained receding horizon control with a least-square prediction algorithm. Then the average strand speeds for the interevent times are obtained and applied as a command signal to a motor control system. It is proved that the proposed output-constrained receding horizon control law with a short horizon stabilizes the closed-loop system and the steady-state error for a set-point becomes zero. The real-time experiments are carried out in a POSCO (Pohang Steel Company, Korea) sintering plant and satisfactory results are presented in this paper. Also, computer simulations are carried out and compared with the real-time experiments.

40|$|A {{total of}} 10 sample disks of 2024 -T 3 {{aluminum}} and 4130 ferrous steel {{were exposed to}} rocket-triggered lightning currents at the Kennedy Space Center test site. The experimental configuration was arranged so that the samples were not exposed to the preliminary streamer, wire-burn, or following currents {{that are associated with}} an upward-initiated rocket-triggered flash but which are atypical of naturally initiated lightning. Return-stroke currents and continuing currents actually attaching to the sample were measured, augmented by close-up video recordings of approximately 3 feet of the channel above the sample and by 16 -mm movies with 5 -ms resolution. From these data it was possible to correlate individual damage spots with streamer, return-stroke, and continuing currents that produced them. Substantial penetration of 80 -mil aluminum was produced by a continuing current of submedian amplitude and duration, and full penetration of a 35 -mil steel sample occurred under an eightieth percentile continuing current. The primary purpose of the data acquired in these experiments is for use in improving and quantifying the fidelity of laboratory simulations of lightning <b>burnthrough...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sintering is {{a complex}} {{industrial}} process that applies heat to fine particles of iron ore and other materials to produce sinter, a solidified porous material used in blast furnaces. The sintering process needs to be carefully adjusted, so that the combustion zone reaches {{the bottom of the}} material just before the discharge end. This is known as the <b>burnthrough</b> point. Many different parameters need to be finely tuned, including the speed and the quantities of the materials mixed. However, in order to achieve good results, sintering control requires precise feedback to adjust these parameters. This work presents a sensor to monitor the sintering burn-through point based on infrared thermography. The proposed procedure is based on the acquisition of infrared images {{at the end of the}} sintering process. At this position, infrared images contain the cross-section temperatures of the mixture. The objective of this work is to process this information to extract relevant features about the sintering process. The proposed procedure is based on four steps: key frame detection, region of interest detection, segmentation and feature extraction. The results indicate that the proposed procedure is very robust and reliable, providing features that can be used effectively to control the sintering process...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} plasma in Korea Superconducting Tokamak Advanced Research (KSTAR), the {{electron}} cyclotron heating (ECH) {{system has been}} an essential tool for ECH-assisted start-up using second-harmonic 84 -GHz and 110 -GHz ECH and for experimental studies of other physics issues such as edge-localized mode control, rotation control, sawtooth control, tearing mode control, and core impurity control for long-pulse discharge and noninductive start-up. The loop voltage in KSTAR is limited by superconducting ohmic coils and a thick vacuum vessel. The ECH-assisted start-up was useful to overcome <b>burnthrough</b> during the ramp-up phase with limited loop voltage by the electron cyclotron beam injection {{before or after the}} onset of the inductive loop voltage to reduce resistive power consumption. Later, the 170 -GHz ECH-system is installed as a main electron heating and local current drive for the I. INTRODUCTION control of magnetohydrodynamic modes such as sawteeth and neoclassical tearing modes. The 170 -GHz gyrotron is an ITER preprototype gyrotron developed by the Japan Atomic Energy Agency.

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of preparations concerning the International Space Welding Experiment (ISWE), studies were performed {{to better understand the}} effect of molten metal contact and electron beam impingement with various fabrics for space suit applications. The question arose as to what would occur if the electron beam from the Ukrainian Universal Hand Tool (UHT) designed for welding in space were to impinge upon a piece of Nextel AF- 62 ceramic cloth designed to withstand temperatures up to 1427 C. The expectation was that the electron beam would lay down a static charge pattern with no damage to the ceramic fabric. The electron beam is capable of spraying the fabric with enough negative charge to repel further electrons from the fabric before significant heating occurs. The static charge pattern would deflect any further charge accumulation except for a small initial amount of leakage to the grounded surface of the welder. However, when studies were made of the effect of the electron beam on the insulating ceramic fabric it was surprisingly found that the electron beam did indeed burn through the ceramic fabric. It was also found that the shorter electron beam standoff distances had longer <b>burnthrough</b> times than did some greater electron beam standoff distances. A possible explanation for the longer <b>burnthrough</b> times for the small electron beam standoff distance would be outgassing of the fabric which caused the electron beam hand-tool to cycle on and off to provide some protection for the cathodes. The electron beam hand tool was observed to cycle off at the short standoff distance of two inches likely due to vapors being outgassed. During the electron beam welding process there is an electron leakage, or current leakage, flow from the fabric. A static charge pattern is initially laid down by the electron beam current flow. The static charge makes up the current leakage flow which initially slightly heats up the fabric. The initially laid down surface charge leaks a small amount of current. The rate at which the current charge leaks from the fabric controls how fast the fabric heats up. As the ceramic fabric is heated it begins to outgass primarily from contamination/impurities atoms or molecules on and below the fabric surface. The contaminant gases ionize to create extra charge carriers and multiply a current of electrons. The emitted gas which ionized in the electron leakage flow promotes further leakage. Thus, the small leakage of charge from the fabric surface is enhanced by outgassing. When the electron beam current makes up the lost current, the incoming electrons heat the fabric and further enhance the outgassing. The additional leakage promotes additional heating up of the ceramic fabric. The electrons bound to the ceramic fabric surface leak off more and more as the surface gets hotter promoting even greater leakage. The additional electrons that result also gain energy in the field and produce further electrons. Eventually the process becomes unstable and accelerates to the point where a hole is burned through the fabric...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} {{of a high}} power laser beam with a solid target is characterised by several processes. Firstly, the laser light is absorbed {{by a variety of}} mechanisms up to the maximum density for electromagnetic wave propogation in a plasma. The energy absorbed is transported to higher density by electron thermal conduction and the heated material ablates from the solid surface, exerting a pressure typically tens of megabars. Such a pressure drives a strong shock into the solid target and may compress it to several times the initial density. In this thesis two of these processes are studied. Firstly, shock compressed targets are probed with X-rays to reveal the electronic structure of chlorine atoms at pressures of about 40 megabars and temperatures of 10 " 5 K. Under these conditions a blue shift of the chlorine K-absorption edge is observed. Relatively simple theoretical modelling was successful in predicting not only the direction of the shift but also predicted the magnitude reasonably accurately. The second set of experiments were designed to study electron thermal transport in spherical plasmas. The microdot spectroscopy technique was used in the first experiment with relatively long (1 ns) laser pulses and moderate incident irradiances (10 " 1 " 4 Wcm"-" 2). Detailed time resolved density and temperature histories, coupled with space resolved spectroscopy were used to infer near-classical heat flow as expected from theoretical modelling. This represents an advance over previous experiments, relying on mass ablation rate data, which is thought to be an unreliable diagnostic of heat flow. Experiments on spherical multilayer targets with shorter pulses (70 ps) were also performed. The <b>burnthrough</b> to the varying layers was used as a measure of the scalelength of the temperature gradient. This was shown to be on a scale of a few microns. Non-local effects of the heat front are thought to have been important in this experiment.
