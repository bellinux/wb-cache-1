In this paper, formability of galvanized sheet was firstly researched by Erichsen experiment.

Then finite element analysis was used, it puts the zinc coating and the substrate in connection by using automatic-surface-to-surface-tiebreak and sets {{up a series of}} forming limitation diagrams (FLD) of galvanized sheet and of zinc coating under different punch strokes. Then depth of the cup when zinc coating reaches critical state was got, which decreased about 5 %- 10 % compared with <b>bare</b> <b>sheet.</b> At last, failure mechanism of zinc coating was discussed, the reason is that material of zinc coating is soft and the friction leads to pulverization and exfoliation of zinc coating. The simulation results are consistent with the Erichsen experiment ones. Conclusions of this paper can provide theoretical guidance for the stamping process design of galvanized sheet...|$|E

One sealant, the PRC-DeSoto PR- 1432 GP and several surface treatments were examined. The surface treatments attempted were AlClad, Chromic Acid Anodization on <b>bare</b> <b>sheets,</b> and Alodine chemical conversion coating on <b>bare</b> <b>sheets.</b> <b>Bare</b> <b>sheets</b> without a surface treatment were also evaluated to establish a baseline comparison. Ultimate lap shear testing {{was based on the}} unguided NASM 1312 - 4 2 -spot weld coupon configuration and the guided NASM 1312 - 21 4 -spot weld coupon configuration. Results indicated that the sealants and surface treatments decreased the joint strength of the individual spot welded joints a relatively small amount compared to the bare material strength. However, the sealant’s adhesive properties can potentially compensate for this loss if there is sufficient sealant coverage. The guided NASM 1312 - 21 4 -spot weld coupon configuration was used for fatigue testing. Uniform amplitude fatigue tests were conducted with a variety of load levels to generate a load-life curve. The sealants and surface treatment seemed to have no effect on fatigue life at medium to low fatigue load levels. However, at high fatigue load levels, the sealants and surface treatments were slightly detrimental. The fatigue lives of the swept FSSW coupons was less than those of the NAS 1097 AD 4 riveted coupons at the medium to low loads. However, the swept FSSW coupons were not optimized for fatigue and may improve under such conditions. The results of the corrosion testing indicated that the integrity of the sealant was not compromised by the swept FSSW. Generally, the surface treatments were not affected by the FSSW operation except where the tools displaced the surface and on the anvil side of the coupon in the heat affected zone. Since these areas are more vulnerable to corrosion, some protection should be added after welding. In general, the results {{of this project}} show that swept FSSW can successfully weld through sealants and surface treatments with only a minimum loss of the ultimate strength or fatigue life of the joint. The FSSW operation can be performed while maintaining most of the corrosion resistance...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Mineral wool was used to find noise absorption coefficient. Random and normal sound absorption coefficient values were predicted. Then, the measures of transmission loss calculated as an overall value, for applied absorbent material and <b>bare</b> <b>sheet</b> metal. Results: The measured values of noise with one octave band frequency demonstrated an attenuation of 5. 5 - 7 dB for these frequencies. The absorption coefficients of materials showed that mineral wool had more normal sound coefficients than its random sound absorption coefficient values. Conclusion: It can be concluded that predicted normal sound absorption coefficients of used mineral wool materials were near to the areas of standard line. It seems that the amount or thickness of absorbent lining was a main reason of noise reduction in low band frequencies.

The general trends of the results were for larger effects of bending for the higher B/M ratios, the lower membrane stresses, and the thicker material. The addition of cyclic bending stresses to a test with cyclic membrane stresses had only a small effect on the growth rates of through-thickness cracks in the thin material, but had a significant effect on the crack growth rates of through-thickness cracks in the thick material.

40|$|Abstract. Friction stir welding (FSWing) induces {{residual}} stresses and distortions in welded structures. Such {{residual stresses}} reduce the fatigue life of welded components, while the induced distortions prevent the welding of large or thin components. In the present study, needle peening {{was used to}} induce additional residual stresses in 2. 3 -mm thick (FSWed) aluminum alloy (AA) 2024 -T 3 sheets. This {{was done with the}} objective to counterbalance the welding-induced stresses and thus reduce the overall stresses and distortions. The needle peening process, which stems from shot peening, consists of hammering a surface using cylindrical spherical ended shots sliding back and forth in a treatment head. An instrumented needle peening machine was used to carry out peening on as-received (or bare) and bead-on-plate FSWed AA 2024 -T 3 material. In both cases, the width of the peening area corresponded to that of a typical weld. The influence of the peening process parameters such as needle size, applied power and travel speed on the surface quality and magnitude of the induced distortions were evaluated. The results indicate that, by increasing the needle diameter from 1. 2 mm to 2. 0 mm, the peening-induced deflection on <b>bare</b> <b>sheet</b> material increased by an average value of 27 % while the roughness average, Ra, decreased by an average value of 47 %. It was also found that a surface finish qualitatively similar to that of conventional shot peening could be obtained by using appropriate needle peening trajectories. Finally, needle peening with an applied power of 10 % was sufficient for eliminating 37 % of the welding-induced transverse curvature and 82 % of the welding-induced longitudinal curvature...|$|E

A force-controlled riveting method was employed to install the rivets in the joints using three different rivet squeeze forces, 35. 59 kN, 44. 48 kN, and 53. 38 kN. After releasing the squeeze forces, the lap joints were then loaded in tension to a maximum stress of 98. 5 MPa. In-situ micro-strain gauges were {{used to measure the}} strain variations during the entire loading sequence. Three-dimensional (3 D) finite element (FE) models were generated to simulate the experimental set up.

The residual minimum principal stress resulting from the riveting process and maximum principal stress when the joints were in tension determined from the FE analyses are present.

The tendency for flaking {{is much more}} pronounced on Cu and Cu– 4 wt%Sn than on Cu– 15 wt%Zn and Cu– 5 wt%Al– 5 wt%Zn. This difference is explained by the initial formation of zinc and zinc–aluminum hydroxycarbonates on Cu 15 Zn and Cu 5 Al 5 Zn, which delays the formation of CuCl, a precursor of Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl. As a result, the observed volume expansion during transformation of CuCl to Cu 2 (OH) 3 Cl, and concomitant corrosion product flaking, is less severe on Cu 15 Zn and Cu 5 Al 5 Zn than on Cu and Cu 4 Sn...|$|R
40|$|Dynamic {{analysis}} {{programs and}} empirical formulae {{are often used}} to compute the period of vibration of single-storey steel buildings. Recent ambient vibration tests of buildings in Quebec and British Columbia {{have shown that the}} predicted period of vibration is typically much longer than that measured. Software and empirical formulae do not usually take into account the stiffening effects of the non-structural components; this could be the source of the discrepancy between the results in the field and the results obtained by computational methods. This research project concentrates on the roof diaphragm system of single-storey steel buildings and the contribution of the non-structural components to diaphragm stiffness. It is believed that the non-structural components, roofing materials such as gypsum board and fibreboard, add to the overall stiffness of the system. A roofing system called AMCQ SBS- 34 consisting of gypsum board, ISO insulation board and fibreboard, all hot bitumen adhered, was studied. The full roof system, as well as its individual components and connections, were first studied through laboratory testing. The flexural and shear stiffness of the fibreboard and gypsum panels, as well as the shear stiffness and equivalent flexural stiffness of the complete roof system and shear stiffness of the roofing connections were determined. Linear elastic finite element models, using the SAP 2000 software, were developed to replicate the behaviour of <b>bare</b> <b>sheet</b> steel and clad diaphragm test specimens. The test based properties of the roofing components and connections were incorporated into the definition of the elements. The models were then calibrated {{based on the results of}} large-scale diaphragm tests by Yang. Once the elastic behaviour of the diaphragms had been matched, a parametric study was performed in order to assess the importance of the contribution of the roofing assembly relative to the roof deck panel thickness. It was shown that as the deck thickness increases, the relative contribution of the non-structural components decreases on a percentage basis, but does not become non-negligible. The increase in shear stiffness of the diaphragm ranges from 58. 6 % for the 0. 76 mm deck panel to 4. 7 % for the 1. 51 mm roof deck panel, dependent on the sidelap and deck-to-frame connection configuration...|$|E

40|$|Diamond coating with {{sufficient}} adhesion on WC-Co cutting tools {{is expected to}} significantly increase their cutting performance. However, the adhesion is always limited by the formation of graphitic soot in the interface due to the catalytic effect of Co on graphite formation. Moreover, the low nucleation density and the high thermal stress in the coatings also result in poor adhesion. The introduction of interlayer {{is one of the}} available approaches to enhance the coating-substrate interfacial adhesion. The goal of this project is to improve the adhesion through the optimization of interlayer design. The Al 2 O 3 and Ta mono-interlayer, Al-Al 2 O 3, Al-AlN, Al 2 O 3 -Ta and Al-Ta duplex interlayer systems have been developed in this study. These interlayer materials were prepared using a magnetron sputtering method, and diamond coating were deposited on them using microwave plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition. In addition, different diamond seeding conditions have been studied to increase the diamond nucleation density. Grazing incident X-ray diffraction was carried out to determine the phase components in the Al-Al 2 O 3 and Al-AlN interlayers. Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to evaluate the quality, morphology and microstructure of the deposited diamond coatings. Rockwell C indentation testing was performed to evaluate the adhesion of the coatings. To elucidate the coating failure mechanism, the compositions around the delaminated spots of diamond coatings after indentation were identified by Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. To evaluate the tribological properties of the diamond coatings, the diamond coated WC-Co sheets were rubbed against steel and alumina balls respectively. The results show that continuous diamond coatings were achieved on Al 2 O 3, Al-Al 2 O 3, Al-AlN and Al-Ta interlayered substrates, whereas a graphite layer was still formed with the Ta monolayer or Al 2 O 3 -Ta duplex layer accompanied by an easy spallation of diamond coatings. The Al interlayer has {{played an important role in}} obtaining high purity diamond by in-situ forming an alumina barrier layer. Especially, the diamond coating deposited with an Al-AlN interlayer exhibits superior interfacial adhesion in comparison with all the other interlayers. Meanwhile, seeding with nano-diamond particles is more efficient than micro-diamond particles for improving the diamond nucleation density on Al-AlN interlayered substrates. Furthermore, the diamond coated WC-Co sheets possess lower coefficient of friction and wear rate than <b>bare</b> <b>sheets</b> when rubbing against either steel or alumina balls...|$|R
40|$|In the {{resistance}} spot welding process, copper-based electrodes both conduct current and deliver force. The resultant heat and pressure of the welding process causes wear that decreases the useable life of the electrode. The wear process is accelerated considerably when welding galvanized steel sheet as compared to <b>bare</b> steel <b>sheet.</b> Electrodes used to weld galvanized sheet experience higher temperatures, pressures, and chemical attack from the zinc coating. As a result, the electrode material softens, the electrode face enlarges, and brass alloy layers form on the electrode face. If these wear mechanisms can be circumvented, electrode life can be appreciably increased and the principle user of the spot welding process, the automotive industry, can recognize significant cost savings.

The edge-cracked pin-loaded specimens of 8 in. in width were tested at constant-amplitude loading with a stress ratio of 0. 2, producing stable crack growth aldose to 4 in. completely through two dents on the crack line. Dents were produced with a drop tower having a 0. 5 in. spherical hardened-steel indenter head. Dent depths ranged from 0. 03 to 0. 0325 in., measured on the convex side of the specimen. A starter notch of 0. 3 in. was produced at the edge of the specimen with a jeweler's saw blade. The specimen was fatigue-loaded under constant-amplitude loading to produce an initial crack length of 0. 37 in., at which time readings of crack length vs cycles began.

40|$|Spot welding {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} joining technologies, especially in the automotive industry. Hitherto, the quality of spot welded joints is tested mainly by random destructive tests. A nondestructive testing technique offers the benefit of cost reduction of the testing procedure and optimization of the fabrication process, because every joint could be examined. This would lead to a reduced number of spot welded joints, as redundancies could be avoided. In the procedure described here, the spot welded joint between two zinc-coated steel sheets (HX 340 LAD+Z 100 MB or HC 340 LA+ZE 50 / 50) is heated optically on one side. Laser radiation and flash light are used as heat sources. The melted zone, the so called "weld nugget" provides the mechanical stability of the connection, but also constitutes a thermal bridge between the sheets. Due to the better thermal contact, the spot welded joint reveals a thermal behavior different from the surrounding material, where the heat transfer between the two sheets is much lower. The difference in the transient thermal behavior is measured with time resolved thermography. Hence, the size of the thermal contact between the two sheets is determined, which is directly correlated to the size of the weld nugget, indicating the quality of the spot weld. The method performs well in transmission with laser radiation and flash light. With laser radiation, it works even in reflection geometry, thus offering the possibility of testing with just one-sided accessibility. By using heating with collimated laser radiation, not only contact-free, but also remote testing is feasible. A further convenience compared to similar thermographic approaches is the applicability on <b>bare</b> steel <b>sheets</b> without any optical coating for emissivity correction. For this purpose, a proper way of emissivity correction was established...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Aerospace EngineeringIn many industries, {{the use of}} {{articulated}} robots {{has proven}} to be an efficient and beneficial way in which to reduce manufacturing costs, e. g., by increasing productivity through automating repetitive processes. However, because of their limited payload capacity, articulated robotic arms have found limited use in processes like friction stir welding (FSW), which require precise position control under relatively high process loads. This limitation in payload has restricted the use of robots to low-loading operations in manufacturing. One way to increase the usefulness of robots for FSW is to reduce the process forces to which they are required to react. One potential area of robotic application is friction stir spot welding (FSSW), a variant of FSW. FSSW is typically used to join two overlapped sheet metal workpieces. A significant portion of the process cycle of FSSW is the plunge cycle. The axial (z) load generated in the process can be substantial depending on selection of the weld tool and process parameters. This study is a continuation of the work performed in the first phase on a gantry-style FSW machine to analyze the process feedback forces, mainly the axial force. In the first phase of this project, the level of the axial force required to produce FSSW in an AA 2024 -T 3 <b>bare</b> aluminum <b>sheet,</b> was significantly lowered by reducing the weld tool shoulder diameter from 0. 4 inches (10. 2 mm) to 0. 3 inches (7. 6 mm).

The effects of process parameters were analyzed using the design of experiments (DOE) approach.

The technique aims towards a more environmentally friendly lubrication to be used in shaping of copper <b>sheets.</b> <b>Bare</b> copper samples were subjected to unidirectional sliding using a tribometer with ball-on-disk contact geometry. Copper substrates (20 mm 2 × 1 mm) were run against 100 Cr 6 Ø 10 mm ball bearing counterbodies. All tests were conducted using the same sliding conditions with a normal load of 10 N, tangential velocity of 0. 01 m/s, at room temperature of 20 °C. Worn surfaces were analyzed by Scanning Electron Microscopy, Optical Microscopy and White Light Interference Profilometry. When comparing to sliding tests in the pure ethanol solvent, significant decreases in terms of wear track dimensions, transferred material on the ball and friction coefficients are observed when active molecules are present in the solution. These form protective tribofilms exhibiting lubricating and anti-wear properties. Deeper studies on the tribological behavior of copper in C 4 P solution show that both low friction and low transfer of work material to the ball prevail in a specific range of low molecule concentration (5 × 10 − 4 M; 25 × 10 − 4 M). Even if the molecules are introduced during the test, after a few cycles, the tribological behavior improves, regardless of both friction level and copper surface degradation. Finally, specific friction tests were performed to further investigate the mechanisms. It was found that two mechanisms are involved; firstly molecules grafting onto the surface directly reduces friction, and secondly transformation of these grafted molecules into a tribofilm during the first mechanical contact cycles reduces it even further...|$|R
40|$|Background: Fine-needle {{aspiration}} (FNA) {{of difficult}} breast lesions {{often results in}} an atypical (C 3) report. The assortment of outcomes generated by C 3 reports varies widely, and this {{has given rise to}} different clinical management pathways. Objective: To identify and objectively assess microscopic features associated with atypical/C 3 breast FNA cases. Materials and Methods: A total of 230 atypical breast FNAs were subjected to a blind microscopic rescreen using a range of robust qualitative and quantitative cytological criteria including cellularity, architectural qualities, cytomorphology and background features. A logistic regression with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the resultant forward stepwise analysis were conducted to assess the results. This statistical testing was measured against malignant, benign proliferative and benign non-proliferative outcomes. Results: The malignant and benign proliferative outcomes showed a mixture of opposing protective and predictive individual cytological criteria. The stepwise analysis produced models demonstrating the best combination of individual cytological criteria for malignancy, proliferative and benign non-proliferative entities. In the malignancy model, discohesion, nuclear crowding within sheets, diminished numbers of bare bipolar nuclei and myoepithelial cells, the presence of tubules or necrosis and the absence of a cystic background were important features. The benign proliferative model suggested the same criteria but with the opposite implication and with the addition of several others, such as the presence of apocrine metaplasia, retained polarity and a speckled or coarse chromatin pattern. Age was a significant factor in malignant and proliferative outcomes. The benign non-proliferative stepwise analysis produced a model with fewer criteria (complex <b>sheets,</b> <b>bare</b> bipolar nuclei and a cystic background) limiting clinical application. Conclusion: Atypical/C 3 breast cytology remains a legitimate reporting category. However, it is associated with a number of different histological outcomes. The incidence of the C 3 category can be significantly reduced by controlling extrinsic factors and understanding the associated microscopic features...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering"December 2006. "The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} the effect of dents on the fatigue properties of 0. 04 inch thick 2024 -T 3 <b>bare</b> aluminum <b>sheet,</b> which is the most widely used material for aircraft skin. The study is divided into two parts. The first part (Part I) is a study on the effect of dents on the fatigue life of the material, while the second part (Part II) is a study on the effect of dents on crack growth in the material. The test specimens were either pristine (no dents), dented or reworked. For Part I, the dented and reworked specimens were divided into two groups, depending on the dent depth ranges. The dent depths for each of these two groups ranged from 0. 030 ” to 0. 0335 ” and 0. 0605 ” to 0. 065 ”. Dents were produced with a drop tower having a 0. 5 inch spherical hardened steel indenter head. The fatigue life of the material in these three conditions was determined experimentally. Constant amplitude fatigue tests were conducted according to ASTM- 466 with a single stress level and a single frequency for the fatigue cycle. The results were then compared to determine the effect of dents and the reworking of dents on the fatigue life of the material. Results of the study indicate that the fatigue life of a dented specimen is significantly less than that of the pristine and the reworked specimens. The study also showed that the fatigue life decreases as the dent depth increases in the dented specimens. Statistical analysis of the results showed that there is no significant difference in the fatigue life between the reworked population and the pristine population of specimens, while reworking considerably improves the fatigue life of the dented material. For Part II, the specimens are again either pristine dented or reworked. The edgecracked pin-loaded specimens of 8 ” in width were tested at constant amplitude loading with a stress ratio of 0. 2 producing stable crack growth of close to 4 inches completely through two dents on the crack line. Dents were produced the same as described for Part I. Dent depths ranged from 0. 03 ” to 0. 0325 ” measured on the convex side of the specimen. A starter notch of 0. 3 ” was produced at the edge of the specimen with a jeweler’s saw blade. The specimen was fatigue loaded under constant amplitude loading to produce an initial crack length of 0. 37 ” t which time readings of crack length vs. cycles began. The same constant amplitude cyclic loading used to produce the initial crack length was used during the testing. The crack lengths were measured with an optical microscope at 160 X magnification. Nine specimens were tested including three replications for each of the three conditions. Crack growth data is given in both tabular and graphical form for all specimens. Crack growth rate data is also presented in graphical form. The overall crack growth in the dented specimens was significantly greater than in the pristine specimens. It was also, on the average, faster in the reworked specimens however, reworking, in general, did not recapture the life displayed by the pristine specimens...|$|R
40|$|Electrically {{conductive}} polymers encompass {{an exciting}} {{field of research}} for applications in dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC’s). DSSC’s possess several advantages over other types of solar cells. They offer the potential for high quantum efficiency, solar conversion efficiency approaching that of traditional silicon panels, rapid charge transfer kinetics for photo-excited electrons, mechanical flexibility, and cost efficient manufacturing processes. However, key drawbacks to their large scale production and performance lifetime lie in their reliance on costly indium tin oxide (ITO), fluorinated tin oxide (FTO), and platinum for electrode materials, and the mechanical fragility inherent to a liquid electrolyte layer component. Much of the current {{research in the field}} concerns identifying an effective solid material to replace the liquid electrolyte presently used in DSSC’s. Within this field of research, electrically conductive polymers (ECP’s) have attracted much interest. One such ECP, PEDOT:PSS [poly(3, 4 -ethylenedioxythiophene) :poly(styrenesulfonate) ] has a combination of high flexibility, electrical conductivity, and optical transmittance, making it a viable candidate. Another subset of this research field involves qualifying a cheaper candidate for replacing the costly platinum electrode of DSSC’s. Metallic nanoparticles, whose characteristic dimension is on the order of one to hundreds of nanometers, possess unique physical properties emergent at their size scale. Particularly, nanowires of highly conductive metals such as silver deposited on the surface of ECP’s raises the possibility of an electrode made using simple bulk processing techniques and using drastically lower quantities of expensive materials for the electrode than typical for DSSC’s while offering the same level of conductivity. Furthermore, an interesting challenge lies in patterning the nanowire network using a simple bulk driving force. Achieving facile nanowire alignment, and thus anisotropic electrical conductivity, opens the door to a variety of applications extending beyond solar cell electrodes, such as flexible nanoscale circuitry. The present thesis describes and evaluates the physical properties of composite thin films of PEDOT:PSS with silver nanowire networks. A simple laboratory scale method for creating a randomly aligned silver nanowire network on PEDOT:PSS is first studied, revealing impressive conductivity increases on the order of 120 versus the <b>bare</b> PEDOT:PSS film. <b>Sheet</b> resistances of the composite films average 37 Ω/□ with average ultraviolet and visible light (UV-Vis) transmittances of 63 %. UV-Vis transmittance correlates inversely with the surface concentration of nanowires as expected, with a power regression fit to the data (R 2 = 0. 96). Of note, no strong correlation is detected between sheet resistance and nanowire surface concentration within the range tested. Additionally, a method for aligning silver nanowires on PEDOT:PSS using a magnetic field is explored. Unfortunately, no significant anisotropy in conductivity is measured using the conditions outlined in these experiments, and explanations are discussed leading into recommendations for future work...|$|R
