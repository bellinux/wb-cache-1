25|$|Retirement didn't last long. Astaire {{returned}} {{to the big screen}} to replace the injured Kelly in Easter Parade (1948) opposite Judy Garland, Ann Miller, and Peter Lawford and for a final reunion with Rogers (replacing Judy Garland) in The Barkleys of Broadway (1949). Both of these films revived Astaire's popularity and in 1950 he starred in two musicals - one for M-G-M - Three Little Words with Vera-Ellen and Red Skelton and one on loan-out to Paramount - Let's Dance with Betty Hutton. While Three Little Words did quite well at the box office, Let's Dance was a financial disappointment. Royal Wedding (1951) with Jane Powell and Peter Lawford proved to be very successful, but The Belle of New York (1952) with Vera-Ellen was a critical and box-office disaster. The Band Wagon (1953), which is considered {{to be one of the}} finest musicals ever made, received rave reviews from critics and drew huge crowds. But because of its excessive cost, it failed to make a profit on its first release. Soon after, Astaire, along with all the other remaining stars at M-G-M, was let go from his contract because of the advent of television and the downsizing of film production. In 1954, Astaire was about to start work on a new musical, Daddy Long Legs (1955) with Leslie Caron at 20th Century Fox, when his wife Phyllis became ill and suddenly died of lung cancer. Astaire was so bereaved that he wanted to shut down the picture and offered to pay the production costs out of his own pocket. However, Johnny Mercer (the film's composer) and Fox studio executives convinced him that work would <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for him at that time. When Daddy Long Legs was released in 1955, it did only moderately well at the box office. His next film for Paramount, Funny Face (1957), teamed him with Audrey Hepburn and Kay Thompson and despite the sumptuousness of the production and the strong reviews from critics, it failed to make back its cost. Similarly, Astaire's next project - his final musical at M-G-M, Silk Stockings (1957), in which he co-starred with Cyd Charisse, also lost money at the box office. As a result, Astaire withdrew from motion pictures for two years.|$|E

Happy to have avoided heartbreak, Beyoncé continues to sing about her ex-lover, who did not recognize {{the possibility of a}} happy relationship with Beyoncé until the relationship broke down. Beyoncé no longer desires her lover after discovering his deceit; as shown in the pre-chorus and chorus lines, [...] "When I think of the time that I almost loved you / You showed your ass and I saw the real you / Thank God you blew it, I thank God I dodged a bullet / I’m so over you, so baby good looking out / I wanted you bad / I’m so through with that / Because honestly / You turned out to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> I never had / And will always <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> you never had." ...|$|E

500|$|On February 16, 1975, Cher {{returned}} to television with a solo show on CBS. Called Cher, {{it began as}} a highly rated special with guests Flip Wilson, Elton John, and Bette Midler. The show was produced by Geffen and centered on Cher's songs, monologues, comedy performance, and her variation of clothing, which was the largest for a weekly TV show. Early critical reception was favorable; the Los Angeles Times exclaimed that [...] "Sonny without Cher was a disaster. Cher without Sonny, on the other hand, could <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> that's happened to weekly television this season." [...] Cher lasted for less than a year, replaced by a new show in which she professionally reunited with ex-husband Sonny; she said, [...] "doing a show alone was more than I could handle." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal {{was critical of}} New Directions' mash-up performance, deeming {{it one of the}} worst performances of the season. He enjoyed the deaf choir's rendition of [...] "Imagine", but wished that New Directions had not interrupted and joined in with them. Mike Hale of The New York Times also disapproved of New Directions joining in with the deaf choir, writing that [...] "Imagine": [...] "was shaping up to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> in the episode" [...] until New Directions [...] "torpedoed the moment." [...] Liz Pardue of Zap2it felt that with [...] "Hairography" [...] Glee [...] "wasn't at its best", deeming the writing less sharp than usual and observing that the pregnancy storyline dulled the episode for her. Pardue felt that New Directions were [...] "butting in" [...] to the Haverbrook performance of [...] "Imagine", which she found [...] "a little insulting", observing: [...] "Good intentions, but cringe-y outcome." [...] Pardue also criticized the mash-up of [...] "Hair" [...] and [...] "Crazy in Love" [...] as [...] "hideous".|$|E
500|$|Recording {{completed}} in March 1999 and all parties involved were enormously {{proud of the}} record. [...] "When it was done, we were so stoked. It was like a masterpiece for our band," [...] remembered DeLonge. [...] "We knew {{this was going to}} <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> we ever did." [...] Hoppus felt the band achieved the purest, cleanest sound on the record that they had been striving for. Finn felt similarly, proud of his work on the record and believing in retrospect that the album would appeal to the masses. As the album was recorded on analog tape, the trio put enormous trust into Finn to give the record the polished pop sound they wanted, recalled DeLonge in 2012. [...] "The Party Song" [...] was the final song to be completed, and the three were mixing the song coincidentally when lead single [...] "What's My Age Again?" [...] premiered on Los Angeles-based radio station KROQ. Roger Joseph Manning, Jr., best known for his work with Beck, played keyboards for several songs on the album. After production completed, the album was mastered by Brian Gardner at Bernie Grundman Mastering in Hollywood. In 2013, Hoppus referred to Enema of the State as [...] "the heart of Blink-182's musical sensibilities," [...] singling out [...] "its simplicity, its purity, its singularity of purpose between the three of us." [...] According to Barker, the album's title stemmed from DeLonge, who was worried about his diet at the time and using enemas.|$|E
500|$|From {{the age of}} 11, Kylie {{appeared}} in small roles in soap operas including The Sullivans and Skyways. In 1985, she was cast {{in one of the}} lead roles in The Henderson Kids. Minogue took time off school to film The Henderson Kids and while Carol was not impressed, Minogue felt that she needed the independence to make it into the entertainment industry. During filming, co-star Nadine Garner labelled Minogue [...] "fragile" [...] after producers yelled at her for forgetting her lines; she would often cry on set. Minogue was dropped from the second season of the show after producer Alan Hardy felt the need for her character to be [...] "written off". In retrospect, Hardy stated that removing her from the showing [...] "turned out to <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> for her". Interested in following a career in music, Minogue made a demo tape for the producers of weekly music program Young Talent Time, which featured Dannii as a regular performer. Kylie gave her first television singing performance on the show in 1985 but was not invited to join the cast. Kylie was cast in the soap opera Neighbours in 1986, as Charlene Mitchell, a schoolgirl turned garage mechanic. Neighbours achieved popularity in the UK, and a story arc that created a romance between her character and the character played by Jason Donovan culminated in a wedding episode in 1987 that attracted an audience of 20million British viewers. Minogue became the first person to win four Logie Awards in one year and was the youngest recipient of the [...] "Gold Logie" [...] as the country's [...] "Most Popular Television Performer", with the result determined by public vote.|$|E

VanDerWerff felt that the story failed to work [...] "despite featuring Don Most and Valerie Mahaffey doing their very best". Canning thought Most's role as Emma's [...] "racist Ginger Supremacist father was perhaps the greatest bit of casting I've seen on television all year". Urban thought the subplot [...] "worked really well", though she added that there were [...] "missteps". Brittany's campaign rally flash mob, complete with her performance of [...] "Run the World (Girls)", was a huge favorite; Poniewozik called it [...] "an excellent Brittany dance showcase". Hyman was critical of the [...] "ridiculousness" [...] of Rachel's run for senior class president, a development Urban said [...] "made absolutely zero sense". VanDerWerff lauded the [...] "montage of the kids finding out who was cast" [...] in West Side Story, and said it [...] "might <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>thing</b> the show has ever done."
