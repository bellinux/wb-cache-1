5000|$|Scratch {{tests at}} low loads, {{such as the}} Bierbaum microcharacter test, {{performed}} with either 3 gf or 9 gf loads, preceded the development of microhardness testers using traditional indenters. In 1925, Smith and Sandland of the UK developed an indentation test that employed a square-based pyramidal indenter made from diamond. They chose the pyramidal shape with an angle of 136° between opposite faces {{in order to obtain}} <b>hardness</b> <b>numbers</b> that would be {{as close as possible to}} <b>Brinell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>numbers</b> for the specimen. The Vickers test has a great advantage of using one hardness scale to test all materials.The first reference to the Vickers indenter with low loads was made in the annual report of the National Physical Laboratory in 1932. Lips and Sack describes the first Vickers tester using low loads in 1936. There is some disagreement in the literature regarding the load range applicable to microhardness testing. ASTM Specification E384, for example, states that the load range for microhardness testing is 1 to 1000 gf. For loads of 1 kgf and below, the Vickers hardness (HV) is calculated with an equation, wherein load (L) is in grams force and the mean of two diagonals (d) is in millimeters: ...|$|R

Copper phosphide has sufficient electrical conductivity, allowing conventional metal electro-plating.

40|$|Due to the {{extensive}} technically recoverable shale natural gas resources {{and an increase}} in production from shale plays over the last 10 years, it is essential to focus on stimulation techniques to enhance productivity in shale resources. One such stimulation technique is acid fracturing. Similar to hydraulic fracturing, acid fracturing injects acid into a formation at a pressure greater than the fracture pressure, creating fractures and etching the created fracture face. The high carbonate content of the Eagle Ford Shale makes the formation a possible acid fracturing candidate. Minimal research has been completed on the effects of acid fracturing high carbonate-containing shale formations, where various conditions can limit the permeability of petroleum fluids. In this study, eight Eagle Ford shale samples, four from Zone C and four from Zone D, are used to determine the effect of surface etching pattern, acid concentration, calcite content, and <b>Brinell</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>Number</b> on created acid fracture conductivity in the Eagle Ford shale. The resultant surface etching volume is determined by a pre-and post-surface Profilometer scan to calculate the change in surface profile. Calcite content is determined by X-Ray Diffraction analyses. Conductivity tests are performed on the eight samples up to a closure stress of 4000 psi, sample integrity permitting. Based on the results determined in this study, acid fracturing the Eagle Ford shale could provide optimistic increases in production. Acid fracturing treatments in high calcite containing zones of the Eagle Ford shale are expected to result in an increase in productivity. For the Eagle Ford Shale, the surface etching patterns that result in highly sustained conductivity values are channeling and roughness. A direct correlation is shown between calcite content of the shale and resultant surface etching volume. Furthermore, the higher the calcite content of the samples, the more likely the etching pattern will result in channeling and surface roughness. Brinell Hardness tests are completed on Eagle Ford samples determining that, on average, the higher the <b>Brinell</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>number,</b> the better resulting surface etching pattern and sustained acid fracture conductivity...|$|E

These various processes and models have been used continually over the decades {{to find new ways}} of improving weld deposit quality, with the ultimate aim of improving the service life of the resulting weld joints. This quest to find ways of improving weld deposit quality has resulted in the use of Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). TOPSIS is one such technique used for solving multi criteria problems. It is based on the concept that the optimal alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution, and the farthest distance from the negative ideal solution. From applying the TOPSIS technique, it was found that weldment 9 has the best weld mechanical properties with a <b>Brinell</b> <b>hardness</b> <b>number</b> (BHN) of 216, Ultimate tensile strength (UTS) of 600 MPa, Charpy V-notch (CVN) impact energy of 90 J, and a percentage elongation of 23 %.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This study {{applied a}} Face-Centered Central Composite Design to prepare various hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) {{membranes}} using slow ionotropic reactions. After {{the assessment of}} various salting-out agents, sodium carbonate {{was selected as the}} ideal electrolyte capable of inducing sufficient membrane growth. The factors studied included the concentration of hydrox-ypropylcellulose [HPC] (1 – 2 %w/v), concentration of salt [Salt] (10 – 20 %w/v) and the salting-out reaction time (SORT) (96 – 144 hours). The experimental and predicted responses in the design included the measurement of the <b>Brinell</b> <b>Hardness</b> <b>Number</b> (BHN), gel thickness, moisture absorption and membrane erosion. Surface morphological examination revealed that the membranes varied from highly porous to closely packed networks. Statistically, the experi-mental and predicated response values showed no significant differences (p 0. 05) based on a one way ANOVA. A significant decrease in BHN was observed as the [HPC] was increased. This was attributed to an increase in the elasticity of the membrane. The increase in moisture absorption was accompa-nied by an increase in gel thickness and subsequently an increase in membrane erosion around the peripheral areas of the gel structure. In the case of the [Salt], all response values were reduced above 15 %w/v, except {{in the case of the}} BHN. In the case of SORT, there was a substantial increase in the responses above 120 hours, except once again for BHN.

40|$|International audienceBased on the {{relation}} proposed by Tabor in 1951, which connects the {{ultimate tensile strength}} and the yield stress of classical materials to the <b>Brinell</b> or Vickers <b>hardness</b> <b>numbers</b> by a simple factor of proportionality, we propose an extended analytical model for {{the determination of the}} yield stress of brittle materials using nanoindentation data. This model considers the nanoindentation hardness calculated from the projected actual contact area between the indenter and the material which is representative of the real mean pressure exerted by the indenter compared to classical <b>hardness</b> <b>numbers.</b> A coefficient is introduced in the model to integrate the extent of the elastic recovery of the indented material occurring after the withdrawal of the indenter. This is possible by using the criterion defined by the residual to maximum indenter displacements ratio, this criterion being already related to the deformation mode under indentation. Indeed, this criterion allows identifying the piling-up deformation observed for complete or fully plastic deformation materials or the sinking-in deformation for purely elastic materials. The proposed model thus allows a good estimation of the yield stress of brittle materials for which classical tensile tests are not applicable.
