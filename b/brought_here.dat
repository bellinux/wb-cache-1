When is that quality of influence which our form of government was intended to secure to the electors to be restored? … in many parts of our country where the colored population is large the people of that race are by various devices deprived of any effective exercise of their political rights and of many of their civil rights. The wrong does not expend itself upon those whose votes are suppressed. Every constituency in the Union is wronged.|$|E

500|$|In San Diego, Konnan met John Roberts. Dave Meltzer of the Wrestling Observer Newsletter then details Ashenoff's {{first foray}} in to {{professional}} wrestling: [...] "Carlos traveled to Tijuana on Wednesday, January 6, 1988, (his 24th birthday), {{where he was}} led to the dressing area and introduced to Manuel de los Santos, the promoter of the show, and who also wrestled in the main event as “Kiss.” De los Santos {{took one look at}} the 215-pound bodybuilder and did the classic double-take –– what the hell is this guy doing here, and, how quickly can I get this guy in the ring. Konnan introduced himself and explained how he was <b>brought</b> <b>here</b> by his manager/agent, John Roberts. Roberts had already bragged to de los Santos that Carlos had been a wrestler in Florida. Suddenly, a big roar (laughter) went up from another wrestler, Miguel Lopez, who wrestled as Rey Mysterio. Lopez/Mysterio explained to Carlos that Roberts was just a nutty fan, always in the front row, but that he did nothing involved with managing or agent-ing or anything else in the business. Still, the wrestlers asked Carlos, want to give it a try?" [...] Billed as El Centurión ("The Centurion"), Ashenoff debuted for the Universal Wrestling Association (UWA) on January 6, 1988.|$|E

500|$|The 17th-century walled garden covers around , with walls up to [...] high. It lies to {{the west}} of the outer courtyard, and was {{originally}} entered from doors in the south-west and north-east corners. These doors have carved pediments, with strapwork and the Douglas heart emblem over the west door, which led to the terraces. The east door led to St. Fillan's Church, and is carved with the date 1632, together with a monogram of the initials of the Earl and Countess. A kitchen garden was located across the Kirk Lane, and bee boles are located in the walls. A summer house was built into the south-east garden wall in 1675, but was demolished in the 18th century. In 1691, botanist James Sutherland supplied exotic plants, including Persian jasmine, tamarisks and figs, to Aberdour from the Physic Garden in Edinburgh, the forerunner of the Royal Botanic Garden. The later entrance in the west wall dates from around 1740. During the Second World War, the garden was in use as a market garden and for pig rearing. In the centre of the garden, an early 17th-century polygonal sundial is mounted on a 19th-century base. The sundial was <b>brought</b> <b>here</b> in the 1970s, possibly from Castle Wigg in south-west Scotland.|$|E
500|$|Many of the {{original}} features have been lost {{as a consequence of}} the many changes that have taken place over the centuries. [...] Additional features have been added to the interior by Raymond Richards, such as the doorcase around the entrance. [...] The Entrance Hall has retained its medieval shape and low ceiling. [...] It contains the coat of arms of the Richards family and items of weaponry, including a decorative suit of armour dating from the 19thcentury and moved here from Scarisbrick Hall. [...] To the west of the Entrance Hall is the Library. [...] This is in the shape of a double cube, measuring [...] by [...] [...] Its major item is a richly carved Tudor chimneypiece. [...] The bookcases were designed by A.W.N.Pugin. [...] Both of these items were moved here by Raymond Richards, the bookcases coming from Scarisbrick Hall. [...] The bookcases contain a comprehensive collection of books relating to Cheshire. [...] In a corner cabinet is a flint axe head dating from about 2000 BC. [...] This was discovered in the park nearby in 1912. [...] To the south of the Entrance Hall is the Long Hall. [...] This has retained the fireplace and ceiling introduced in the Tudor era. [...] The hall contains items of antique furniture, and paintings by David Wilkie, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable. [...] To the south of the Long Hall is the principal staircase, which was remodelled in 1920. [...] The area around the staircase contains a Waterford glass chandelier dating from about 1780, and a portrait of the first Earl of Harrington by Allan Ramsay. [...] From this area, a door leads into the chapel. [...] This is the third or fourth chapel in the house, and was dedicated to Thomas More when he was canonised in 1935. [...] Much of the woodwork in it dates from 1803. [...] Many of the ornaments in the chapel were <b>brought</b> <b>here</b> by Richards from a redundant church in Ipswich. [...] Two marble plaques in the chapel are by Thomas Thornycroft, a sculptor born in the nearby village. [...] Alongside the chapel is an ambulatory or baptistry which contains a font and items of stained glass, made by Morris & Co. and designed by Edward Burne-Jones. [...] These were obtained by Richards from All Saints Church, Birkenhead. They depict the Crucifixion, and Saints Agnes, George, Stephen and Alban. [...] The south door contains fragments of ancient glass from Plas Newydd, that were originally in a medieval church. [...] Adjacent to the chapel is a conservatory containing marble sculptures by John Warrington Wood.|$|E
