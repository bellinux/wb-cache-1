50|$|Abbotsford is a {{prominent}} early industrial area {{and as a}} result, there are several outstanding examples of industrial buildings. The most prominent is Denton Hat Mills, a large {{turn of the century}} industrial complex designed by architect William Pitt in polychrome brick in 1888. It was the home to <b>Brush</b> <b>Fabrics</b> until 2004, when plans for conversion to apartments were implemented. Work on the conversion began in mid-2007 and was completed in December 2009.|$|R
25|$|Boelcke had to swerve {{to avoid}} a mid-air {{collision}} in the dogfight and Böhme's Albatros briefly collided with that of Boelcke. The wheels of Böhme's plane barely <b>brushed</b> the <b>fabric</b> of the top wing of Boelcke's craft, enough to start the fabric unraveling. Boelcke struggled for control as his plane's control surface shredded in the turbulence. He skillfully crashlanded after the entire upper wing tore loose. However, in his haste to be airborne he had not fastened his seat belt. Boelcke was killed by his relatively mild impact. Böhme survived the accident, as he had suffered only a landing gear damage.|$|R
5000|$|Flannel may be brushed {{to create}} extra {{softness}} or remain unbrushed. Brushing is a mechanical process wherein a fine metal <b>brush</b> rubs the <b>fabric</b> to raise fine fibres from the loosely spun yarns {{to form a}} nap. Typically, flannel has a nap on either one side or both sides. If the flannel is not napped, it gains its softness through the loosely spun yarn in its woven form.|$|R
50|$|A similar device, the lint <b>brush</b> uses a <b>fabric</b> cushion {{mounted to}} a handle, that when rubbed one {{way across the}} fabric to be cleaned, picks up the small fibers. By {{reversing}} the direction of movement across the fabric or by picking off the excess lint, {{it is possible to}} clean the lint brush. Some lint brushes are double sided in order to allow the brush to be used in both directions and to extend the use of the brush by limiting wear.|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a conductive fabric manufacturing method and a fabric manufactured by the same. The method comprises {{the following steps}} of: S 1, grafting a poly(2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl ammonium chloride) (PMETAC) brush to the fiber surface of the fabric; S 2, performing ion exchange treatment on the PMETAC brush grafted fabric; and S 3, performing plating-free deposition on the ion exchanged PMETAC <b>brush</b> grafted <b>fabric.</b> The conductive fabric has stable and uniform high conductivity and can keep good electric conductivity and mechanical property after repeated bending, stretching and even washing, so the conductive fabric {{can be used as}} an electric wire. Moreover, the conductive fabric can also be widely applied in other fields such as functional infrared reflecting articles. 本发明涉及一种导电织物制造方法及其制造的织物。所述方法包括：S 1 、在织物的纤维表面接枝PMETAC刷；S 2 、对PMETAC刷接枝的织物进行离子交换处理；S 3 、对离子交换后的PMETAC刷接枝的织物实施无电镀沉积。本发明的导电织物，具有稳定均一的高导电率，在多次弯折、拉伸甚至洗涤之后都能保持良好的导电性和机械性能，因此可以用作电线。此外还可以广泛用于其他领域，比如用作功能性红外反射物(reflecting article) 。Institute of Textiles and ClothingInventor name used in this publication: 郑子剑Inventor name used in this publication: 刘旭庆Inventor name used in this publication: 胡军岩Title in Traditional Chinese: 導電織物製造方法及其製造的織物Chin...|$|R
5000|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, the car coat was {{an item of}} leisurewear, rather than simply a {{motoring}} accessory, and was being produced {{in a variety of}} fabrics, including sheepskin and the new manmade fur varieties. A fashion writer describing the uses of faux fur said: [...] "Apart from coats they are made into all kinds of leisure wear, of which the now ubiquitous car coat is a conspicuous example. Derived from the more expensive but still popular sheepskin jacket, it is usually made from a cotton suedette or <b>brushed</b> nylon outer <b>fabric</b> lined with an acrylic pile".|$|R
5000|$|Curling <b>brushes</b> {{may have}} <b>fabric,</b> hog hair, or {{horsehair}} heads. Modern curling brush handles are usually hollow tubes made of fibreglass or carbon fibre {{instead of a}} solid length of wooden dowel. These hollow tube handles are lighter and stronger than wooden handles, allowing faster sweeping and also enabling more downward force {{to be applied to}} the broom head with reduced shaft flex. New, [...] "directional fabric" [...] brooms, which players are worried will alter the fundamentals of the sport by reducing the level of skill required, have been accused of giving players an unfair advantage. The new brooms were temporarily banned by the World Curling Federation and Curling Canada for the 2015-2016 season. The new brooms [...] "isolate the friction caused by brushing only where the running surface of the rock has contact with ice--on top of the pebble--with little resistance", which makes sweepers have unprecedented control over the direction the stone goes.|$|R
40|$|High {{energy is}} {{involved}} when a rider impacts a road surface in a crash. Rider speed, {{height of fall}} and road surface morphology all contribute {{to the level of}} initial impact energy. Impact can cause fabrics and seams of protective garments to burst rendering their protective value void. The Cambridge abrasion tester tests protective clothing with a fall height of 50 mm and abrasive belt speed of 28 km/hr, far below what can happen in a “high side” motorcycle crash at 100 km/hr. This work addresses the mechanics of what occurs in the first few microseconds of an impact and provides insight into the effect that speed has on fabric burst. This work used a Cambridge impact abrasion test to evaluate two different protective motorcycle clothing fabrics (a denim and <b>brushed</b> fleecy <b>fabric</b> over a p-aramid protective liner). It measured their abrasion resistance at an abrasion speed of 28 km/hr and standard impact height. It used a high speed camera to measure the impact displacement of the test head. Fabrics with high stretch were more prone to burst failure on initial impact. Fabric burst is caused by a high speed tensile stress between the fabric coupled with the abrasion surface and the inertia of the body dragging against it. Stretch fabrics are pushed into the abrasion surface for a longer period by the body before the tensile stress occurs so the coupling force is higher. If the transition to abrasion occurs early in the impact then a fabric is less likely to burst...|$|R
50|$|Gloves provide {{protection}} from blisters, abrasions, cold and hot objects, and insects. General purpose gloves are a thin glove-liners—wool may be preferred around campfires—combined {{with a pair}} of leather gloves. Glove liners often provide enough dexterity while not fully exposing the hands to freezing conditions. Shoes with traction reduce the chance of slipping, causing an injury or death. Shoes that support the ankle may also prevent injury. Well-constructed, breathable, waterproof hiking boots are general-purpose hiking shoes. Mountaineering boots provide more specialized protection. Trainers, sandles, or moccasins are useful for easy walks and may be taken on extended hikes as backup, and to wear when fording streams and in the evening around camp. Waterproof gaiters are used in cold or wet conditions to protect the lower pants and upper part of the shoes, and reduce the amount of water, snow, and debris from entering boots and soaking into other <b>fabrics.</b> <b>Brush</b> chaps or pants for thick brush or thorns, and snake chaps or gaiters help protect the legs from snake bites.|$|R

H 577 P ITC 2015 LiuXix, 192 pages :color illustrationsTextiles with {{multiple}} functional properties are {{the future of}} the global textile and apparel industry offering new challenges as well as opportunities. A major application of these textiles will be in the field of functional clothing where the consumer is demanding more and more comfort, easy care, health and hygiene {{while at the same time}} expecting protection against mechanical, thermal, chemical and biological attacks. Along with the new functionalities, other desirable properties of finishes include the appearance, feel and durability to laundering. Such complex expectations can only be met by developing new, advanced and innovative technologies for finishing of textile products. To match the requirements of functional fabrics, in this thesis, a systematic study has been carried out to establish active interfaces by grafting polymer <b>brushes</b> on <b>fabrics.</b> These active interfaces are response to moisture, temperature, catalyst, and play as a platform to nanostructures deposition, and several functional fabrics are developed based on the active interface. The knowledge gaps identified in the introduction and literature review have been filled by carrying out the objectives which are summarized below. Firstly, to fill the research gap 1, activated single molecular layer which can both bond fibre with strong adhesion and process reactive chemical groups for further functional polymer brushes growth is developed. Trichlorosilane functionalized initiator for fabric substrates is designed and synthesized. It is proved that polymer brushes could be prepared by combining this designed initiator and the controlled living polymerization on the fabrics' surface,meanwhile commercial 2 -bromoisobutyryl bromide is studied as a reference. The influence on two kinds of initiators for controlled growth of polymer <b>brushes</b> on cotton <b>fabrics</b> is investigated and the designed trichlorosilane functionalized initiator showed some advantage with the commercial 2 -bromoisobutyryl bromide. To fill research gap 2, based on the activated single molecular layer on fibres, responsive polymer brushes are grown directly by the surface-initiated atom transfer radical polymerization (SI-ATRP), to construct a series of active interface on fibres. Poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) brushes which can built up thermal-responsive interface with water is selected since its low critical solution temperature (LCST, 31 ~ 35 °C) is similar to the body temperature. The grafted polymer brushes which can responsively and reversibly control the wettability and hygroscopicity of cotton, meanwhile the smart interface can switch from high water absorptive state below its LCST to low absorptive state above its LCST. Smart systems with properties of moisture management and thermoregulation are investigated systematically on human body. To fill research gap 3, a typical polyelectrolyte, poly- 2 -(methacryloyloxy) ethyl-trimethylammonium chloride (PMETAC) brushes are introduced onto the fibre, to form active polymeric interface which can catch catalyst moleculars from solution and fabricate nanoparticles-polymer brushes. The strong adhesion force between resultant metal composites and fibres leading to excellent mechanical and electrical stability under extensive rubbing, bending, stretching,and washing;and the conductivity can remain stable in air with proper choice of metal. To exploit applicability of this type of polyelectrolyte brushes bridged metal nanoparticles deposition on non-natural synthetic fabrics, plasma assistant grafting polymer brushes was developed. Then PMETAC brushes were grown from the active PET surface by surface initiated ATRP, which act as a platform for ELD of copper particles depositing to form polymer-bridges copper-PET hierarchical structures subsequently. This in-situ depositing approach ensures that the copper nanoparticles could distribute uniformly and continuously on the surface of PET fabric structure. As the site selection of polymer brushes, a new printing strategy that allows for the simple fabrication of high-performance flexible, foldable, and stretchable metal conductors on a wide variety of substrates at room temperature is developed. It is compatible with many printing methods by simply tuning the amount of delivering matrix polymer for specific ink requirement, so as to fabricate features with sizes ranging from sub-micrometer, to micrometer,centimeter, and even meter scales. Therefore, MACP is suitable for experimental prototyping (e. g.,using inkjet printing and DPN), as well as high-throughput fabrication (e. g.,screen printing). Therefore,it shows remarkable application potentials for plastic electronics, smart textiles, electronic skins,and biomedical implants and devices. To fill the research gap 4,composite of metal oxide nanoparticles and polymer brushes are integrated by active polymer brushes through interfacial connection. UV functional metal oxide materials, ZnO nanorods,have been electrolessly deposited on cotton fabrics successfully, meanwhile polyelectrolyte brushes play as supported catalyst capture interface. Surface morphological observation reveals that the process leads to the deposition of hexagonal prism crystallites, a characteristic morphology for the ZnO materials. The optical-UV spectroscopy studies indication those ZnO nanorods deposited on fabrics surface show active defense and shelter against UV radiation. The strong adhesion force between composite of ZnO-polymer brushes and fibres offers excellent wash fastness. To fill the research gap 5, <b>fabrics</b> with micro-nano-polymer <b>brushes</b> are developed. Antifouling polymer brushes are grafting on fabrics with multi-brushes structure. Settlement assays with microalgae/zoospores indicated that the multi-scale polymer brushes could successfully repel the settlement of microalgae/zoospores. In future,the testing in both static and dynamic sea water,especially in dynamic sea water will be carried on. Additionally, antibacterial properties of functional fabrics with nano-copper coating which are mentioned in Chapter 4 are also investigated as extension. It shows an important expanded application of copper nanoparticles-polymer brushes composite. By grafting polymer brushes on fibre,a novel system with active interfaces is constructed and shows responses under external stimuli,including temperature, moisture,chemical solution,and plays as platforms to interact with water, metal nanoparticles, pH values, giving smart, intelligent and interactive textiles. The novel strategy of constructing active interface can be employed to impart more functional properties on various fabrics in future. The active interfacial science of fibre established in this thesis bases on assimilation of different sciences and knowledges such as surface chemistry, organic synthesis, polymer science, nanotechnology, lithography, and biology.

40|$|The Health Hazard Evaluation Program {{received}} {{a request from}} a government program that provides technical assistance to drycleaning shops. The program manager was concerned about occupational exposures to two new drycleaning solvents: SolvonK 4 and DF- 2000. In May 2013, we visited one drycleaning shop that used SolvonK 4 and two that used DF- 2000. SolvonK 4 contains primarily butylal and small amounts of n-butanol and formaldehyde. DF- 2000 {{is a mixture of}} C 11 to C 15 aliphatic-branched hydrocarbons. We observed work practices, collected air samples for drycleaning solvents and other chemicals produced or used during drycleaning, and evaluated potential skin exposures to these chemicals. Our evaluations measured the highest air concentrations of drycleaning solvents during loading and unloading of the drycleaning machines and when pressing fabrics. In the SolvonK 4 shop, we documented inhalation and dermal exposures to butylal (no OELs exist and the long-term human health effects of SolvonK 4 are unknown), and found low concentrations of formaldehyde and butanol. It is unknown if the formaldehyde originated from the drycleaning solvent or from other sources such as furnishings and clothing. We observed that employees without personal protective equipment mixed SolvonK 4 with a pretreatment product and sprayed the mixture onto fabrics. In the DF- 2000 shops, we measured airborne concentrations of DF- 2000 that were well below OELs for petroleum naphthas. We saw employees without adequate personal protective equipment cleaning the stills in the SolvonK 4 and DF- 2000 drycleaning machines. We recommended the drycleaning shops (1) <b>brush</b> pretreatments onto <b>fabrics</b> instead of spraying, (2) regularly inspect and maintain the drycleaning machine according to the manufacturers' recommendations, (3) provide eye protection and chemical resistant gloves to employees, and (4) clean the shop regularly with a high efficiency particulate air filter vacuum cleaner or wet methods. We recommended the employees wear appropriate personal protective equipment, wash their hands or exposed skin with soap and water after contact with chemicals, and wash their hands after removing gloves.

40|$|This thesis started {{life as a}} short, {{illustrated}} {{dissertation on}} early Christian inscriptions in Wales for a lettering and graphics course at Newport College of Art in 1965. In 1995 I returned to research on the subject for an M. Phil. {{under the supervision of}} Miranda Aldhouse Green at the University of Wales, Newport, into which the Art College had been absorbed, and of John Higgitt at the University of Edinburgh. I was very grateful to UWCN to be awarded a bursary to enable me to undertake my M. Phil. Both my supervisors helped me to formulate and improve the ideas that had absorbed me since I was an art student. In the early sixties as a pre-diploma student at Cardiff College of Art I was fortunate to come {{under the influence of the}} lettering historian J. C. Tarr and went on to specialise in lettering at Newport under Harry Meadows who had been a pupil of M. C. Oliver -a pupil of Edward Johnston's. I was again fortunate, working as a book designer in Ireland, to be befriended by Rene Hague, the son-in-law of Eric Gill, with whom I learned <b>brush</b> lettering on <b>fabric</b> and cut lettering in wood, using Gill's chisels. Rene Hague was at that time writing his memoir of David Jones and encouraged me to look closely at his inscriptional work. Both David Jones and J. C. Tarr were fascinated by the fate of the Roman alphabet in the Dark Ages. With Thomas Charles-Edwards from 1975 a shared interest has been the early Christian inscriptions of Britain and Ireland. Very aware of the fact that there might be bonds between young apprentices and old masters, this thesis operates chronologically within the Group I and II time spans used by V. E. Nash-Williams. It is convenient that these spans are loosely defined; unless some new find with a specific dating fix appears, closer dating would seem speculative. The scribe of the manuscript known as the Cathach was of some age, with failing sight, but greatly venerated as a scribe. We know that apprentice scribes were youths with sharp sight. The scribe of the Cathach, who is writing in a primitive, prototype `half-uncial', with many features unstabilised that would be stabilised later in canonical half-uncial, would have trained up young scribes in a version of his own hand. There might have been half a century discrepancy in their ages. In any ll craft, this discrepancy in age between master and apprentice clearly blurs the edges of any layering of chronology based on stylistic features; in Britain and Ireland during the Group I period, additionally, there is the problem that for a period of time scripts could have fossilised or deteriorated in the event of a decrease in literacy and the circulation of books. Therefore it seemed prudent to remain within the looser chronology of Nash-Williams...|$|R
