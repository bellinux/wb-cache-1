2500|$|The {{earliest}} yūrei-zu {{is considered}} to be by Maruyama Ōkyo (円山 応挙), founder of the Maruyama school {{and one of the most}} significant artists of the 18th century. The Ghost of Oyuki (Oyuki no maboroshi - お雪の幻) is a silk scroll painting dating to the second half of the 18th century [...] In Maruyama’s naturalistic style, it depicts a faintly coloured female ghost whose <b>body</b> <b>tapers</b> into transparency. It has been described as an “image of haunting beauty.” According to a scroll box inscription by a one-time owner, the subject of the painting is Maruyama’s lover, a geisha who died young. Her ghost is said to have visited the artist in a dream and inspired him to paint her portrait.|$|E

60|$|As among greater Animals {{there are}} many that are scaled, both for {{ornament}} and defence, so are there not wanting such also among the lesser bodies of Insects, whereof this little creature gives us an Instance. It is a small white Silver-shining Worm or Moth, which I found much conversant among Books and Papers, and is suppos'd to be that which corrodes and eats holes through the leaves and covers; it appears to the naked eye, a small glittering Pearl-colour'd Moth, which upon the removing of Books and Papers in the Summer, is often observ'd very nimbly to scud, and pack away to some lurking cranney, where it may the better protect itself from any appearing dangers.

5000|$|One of P.O. Ackley's {{earliest}} wildcats was the 7mm-06 Improved, {{which was}} made by necking down the [...]30-06Springfield case and fire-forming it to have less <b>body</b> <b>taper</b> and a 40-degree shoulder angle. Soon after the [...]280 Remington came out, Fred Huntington reformed its case to an improved configuration with minimum <b>body</b> <b>taper,</b> a 35-degree shoulder angle, and called it the [...]280 RCBS. Since cases for the [...]280 RCBS could be formed by firing [...]280 Remington ammo in a rifle chambered for the former, Ackley abandoned the 7mm-06 Improved and started chambering rifles for the [...]280 RCBS. He then changed the 35-degree shoulder to 40-degrees and the [...]280 Ackley Improved was born. If barrel length and chamber pressure are equal, the [...]280 Ackley Improved is about 100 fps faster with all bullet weights than the standard [...]280 Remington. In 2007, ammunition manufacturer Nosler registered the [...]280 Ackley Improved with SAAMI and began providing factory loaded ammunition and rifles for it.|$|R
50|$|A phaerimm has a conical {{body that}} is shaped like a windsock. The widest part, the mouth, {{is located at the}} very top of the body. Its <b>body</b> <b>tapers</b> down and ends in a barbed stinger. The top of its head resembles the body of a sea anemone, save for the center being ringed by rows of sharp teeth. The ovoid head is {{surrounded}} by four spindly arms, each four-fingered hand ending in sharp claws. When it hatches, a phaerimm is about a foot long, but it can grow to be thirty feet long in old age.|$|E
50|$|Pteronotropis signipinnis {{is small}} and colourful, growing to between 40 to 55 mm. The <b>body</b> <b>tapers</b> to a narrow caudal peduncle. Much of the sides are covered by a lateral band dark in colour. The caudal, dorsal and anal fins are yellow or red-orange with black {{marginal}} rays. Present on the caudal fin base are two bright sulfur-yellow spots, with the region between the spots being substantially darker. Pteronotropis signipinnis exists syntopically with the sailfin shiner, P. hypselopterus, and the two {{can be difficult to}} differentiate. Pteronotropis signipinnis can be distinguished by its red fins, yellow tail spots, and smaller tubercles.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of D. pavon {{are green}} with yellow-white dots running along their sides, and an indistinct series of yellow-white blotches {{on the upper}} surface. The <b>body</b> <b>tapers</b> {{strongly}} towards a pointed tail. The head is green with black eyes and black mandibles. Two white and black stripes on the front also extend up towards the two long, forward-projecting horns. The horns are green with a forked black tip. The larvae feed on the leaves of hackberries (genus Celtis). In the United States, they are usually found on the desert hackberry (Celtis pallida), while in Mexico they {{can be found on}} the iguana hackberry (Celtis iguanaea).|$|E

50|$|The sticks are {{flexible}} {{and are usually}} made from a type of bamboo. The head of the stick used for the dominant hand is thicker and the <b>body</b> <b>tapers</b> and the end where the hand grips the stick is of normal size. The other stick is slightly thicker and less tapered. The dominant stick usually rests on the wedge of the drum head and the stick is rolled to produce the fluttering sound. It is this feature that gives chande an advantage of producing multiple fillers in between the beats that hands or fingers usually {{will not be able}} to produce on drums. It is played in a forceful manner. The chande groves form what is called the Yakshagana Tala.|$|E
5000|$|Colochirus quadrangularis is a {{moderate}} sized sea cucumber growing to about 10 cm in length. The roughly cylindrical body has four longitudinal ridges {{giving it a}} square cross section and a flat base. It has irregular, thorn-like, soft projections called papillae lying along these ridges. The leathery body wall is reinforced by calcareous spike-like structures which in this species include basket-shaped spicules and perforated ellipsoids. There is a ring of large, branched feeding tentacles round the mouth. There are three rows of red tube feet on the underside and the <b>body</b> <b>tapers</b> at the posterior end, the anus being surrounded by 5 tooth-like projections. The colour is mainly grey often with pink on the ridges and thorns, and with yellow or reddish tentacles.|$|E

5000|$|Compared to a default [...]30-06 round, the [...]30-06 JDJ {{contains}} has {{a smaller}} neck {{that is at}} a 60-degree angle.

This allows the [...]30-06 JDJ to hold an extra 5 grains of water (4.875 cm3) compared to the [...]30-06 Springfield, allowing one to put more gunpowder into the cartridge.|$|R

50|$|The larva is amphipneustic (having {{only the}} {{anterior}} and posterior pairs of spiracle). The body varies from white to yellowish or brown. The posterior end of pale-coloured species is sometimes black. The <b>body</b> <b>tapers</b> at the anterior. The two mandibles sometimes have teeth along the ventral margin. The antennomaxillary lobes at {{each side of}} the mandibles have several transverse oral ridges or short laminae directed posteriorly.

Each posterior spiracle (anal spiracle) lacks a clearly defined peritreme and each has three spiracular openings (in mature larvae). These are usually more or less horizontal, parallel and usually bear branched spiracular hairs in four tufts.|$|E
5000|$|Chordeumatidans are {{relatively}} short-bodied, with only 26-32 body segments behind the head. They range in length from 4 - 25 mm.

The first segment (collum) is relatively narrow, giving the appearance of a distinct [...] "neck" [...] in many species. The <b>body</b> <b>tapers</b> towards the rear, and the rearmost tip (telson) contains silk-producing organs (spinnerets). A dorsal groove runs {{down the length of the}} body, and some species possess paranota, lateral extensions of the exoskeleton. Paranota are also found in some other millipedes, notably Polydesmida, from which Chordeumatidans can be distinguished by having more than 20 body segments and a dorsal groove. Unlike most other helminthomorph (worm-like) millipedes, Chordeumatidans lack ozopores.|$|E
