Osteoblast-like MC 3 T 3 -E 1 cells stimulated by endothelin- 1, melittin, ionomycin or arachidonic acid showed diminished prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) production upon pretreatment with econazole. Following pretreatment with <b>bifonazole,</b> stimulation with ionomycin or arachidonic acid also resulted in decreased PGE 2 formation.

Upon treatment with arachidonic acid thromboxane B 2 (TXB 2) production in human platelets was abolished completely at concentrations of the three imidazole antimycotics higher than 5 [*]μM (IC 50 < 1 [*]μM).

The aim of {{this work}} was to develop and {{characterize}} a highly loaded nanoparticulate system based on amphiphilic -cyclo-dextrins (CDs) to facilitate the parenteral administration of poorly soluble antifungal model drugs <b>bifonazole</b> and clotrimazole. Methods. Inclusion complexes were characterized with spectroscopic techniques. Particle size distribution of nanospheres were determined by photon correlation spectroscopy (PCS). Nanospheres were as-sessed for hemolytic activity. Entrapped and released drug quantities were determined and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) val-ues of drugs, amphiphilic -CDs, and drug loaded nanospheres were evaluated. Results. 1 : 1 inclusion complexes of model drugs with amphiphilic -CDs gave nanospheres < 300 nm (polydispersity index < 0. 15) by nanoprecipitation technique without using surfactants. By direct preparation from preformed inclusion complexes, loading was in-creased 2 - to 8 -fold depending on CD type and loading technique. Conventionally loaded CD nanospheres displayed immediate release whereas preloaded and highly loaded nanospheres liberated model drugs {{over a period of}} 1 h reducing the initial burst effect. MIC values of <b>bifonazole</b> and clotrimazole were lowered significantly when asso-ciated to amphiphilic -CD nanospheres. Conclusion.

In liquid cultures 1 μg of the drug/ml was bacteriostatic and 10 μg/ml was bactericidal. On solid media at 10 μg of azole/ml no resistant mutants could be isolated. An MIC of 1 to 15 μg/ml was observed with ketoconazole, whereas none of these organisms was inhibited by the triazoles fluconazole and voriconazole (100 μg/ml). Imidazoles may offer the prospect of treatment of nocardioform mycetomas and may provide the basis for the development of additional antimicrobial agents to combat these pathogens...|$|E
