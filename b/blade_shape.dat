5|$|The {{transition}} from straight jokotō or chokutō to deliberately curved, {{and much more}} refined Japanese swords (nihontō), occurred gradually {{over a long period}} of time, although few extant swords from the transition period exist. Dating to the 8th century, Shōsōin swords and the Kogarasu Maru show a deliberately produced curve. Yasutsuna from Hōki Province forged curved swords that are considered to be of excellent quality. Stylistic change since then is minimal, and his works are considered the beginning of the old sword (kotō) period, which existed until 1596, and produced the best-known Japanese swordsmiths. According to sources Yasutsuna may have lived in the Daidō era (806–809), around 900; or more likely, was a contemporary of Sanjō Munechika and active in the Eien era (987, 988). The change in <b>blade</b> <b>shape</b> increased with the introduction of horses (after 941) into the battlefield, from which sweeping cutting strokes with curved swords were more effective than stabbing lunges required of foot soldiers. Imparting a deliberate curve is a technological challenge requiring the reversal of natural bending that occurred when the sword edge is hammered. The development of a ridge (shinogi) along the blade was essential for construction. Various military conflicts during the Heian period helped to perfect the techniques of swordsmanship, and led to the establishment of swordsmiths around the country. They settled in locations close to administrative centers, where the demand for swords was high, and in areas with easy access to ore, charcoal and water. Originally smiths did not belong to any school or tradition. Around the mid to late-Heian period distinct styles of workmanship developed in certain regional centers. The best known of these schools or traditions are the gokaden (five traditions) with each producing a distinct style of workmanship and associated with the five provinces: Yamashiro, Yamato, Bizen, Sagami/Sōshū and Mino. These five schools produced about 80% of all kotō period swords. Each school consisted of several branches. In the late Heian period Emperor Go-Toba, a sword lover, summoned swordsmiths from the Awataguchi school of Yamashiro, the Ichimonji school of Bizen and the Aoe school of Bitchū Province to forge swords at his palace. These smiths, known as goban kaji　(honorable rotation smiths) are considered to have been the finest swordsmiths of their time. Go-Toba selected from the Awataguchi, Hisakuni and Ichimonji Nobufusa to collaborate on his own tempering. Early Kamakura period tachi had an elaborately finished tang and an elegant dignified overall shape (sugata). Tantō daggers from the same period showed a slight outward curvature.|$|E

40|$|An inverse {{design process}} {{is applied to}} {{determine}} <b>blade</b> <b>shapes</b> used in vertical axis wind turbines (VAWTs). The method {{is based on the}} modified Garabedian-McFadden technique that uses the deviation of the pressure distribution or the velocity distribution on the surface from a target pressure or velocity distribution, and modifies the blade surface in order to reduce this deviation. The method was originally developed for wing design and applied for such aerofoil shapes as those of horizontal axis wind turbine blades. The procedure is employed here successfully to find a target shape that is used in a VAWT operating with blades of constant thickness rather than of aerofoil shape. The method is presently applicable to determine <b>blade</b> <b>shapes</b> in a two dimensional section, and considers some performance criteria of VAWTs; thus, it contributes to finding <b>blade</b> <b>shapes</b> that most closely corresponds to the efficient operation of such turbines...|$|R

50|$|Most {{turbine blades}} are {{manufactured}} by investment casting (or lost-wax processing). This process involves making a precise negative die of the <b>blade</b> <b>shape</b> that {{is filled with}} wax to form the <b>blade</b> <b>shape.</b> If the blade is hollow (i.e., it has internal cooling passages), a ceramic core {{in the shape of}} the passage is inserted into the middle. The wax blade is coated with a heat-resistant material to make a shell, and then that shell is filled with the blade alloy. This step can be more complicated for DS or SC materials, but the process is similar. If there is a ceramic core in the middle of the blade, it is dissolved in a solution that leaves the blade hollow. The blades are coated with a TBC, and then any cooling holes are machined.|$|E
