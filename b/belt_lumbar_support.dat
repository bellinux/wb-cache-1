40|$|Objective: It {{still remains}} unclear if <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> are {{effective}} {{in the treatment of}} chronic low back pain. The objective {{of the present study was}} to assess and compare the short-term effect of extension-controlled <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> and elastic <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> on low back pain, lumbar flexibility and back-specific disability in chronic low back pain patients. We also investigated the factors affecting the <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> compliance. Materials and Methods: One hundred and eighteen chronic low back pain patients were randomly allocated into three groups. Group 1 (n= 39) was prescribed traditional, extension-controlled lumbar support; group 2 (n= 40) was prescribed elastic lumbar support; both for six hours a day for three weeks. <b>Lumbar</b> <b>support</b> was not prescribed for group 3 (n= 39). All patients used 1000 mg/day naproxen sodium. Pain severity was evaluated with numeric rating scale (NRS), back flexibility was evaluated with the Schober test and back-specific disability was evaluated with the Roland-Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ). A 30 % improvement was considered as threshold for identifying clinically meaningful improvement on NRS and RMDQ. Results: Clinically meaningful improvement was detected on NRS (45 %) and RMDQ (35 %) in group 1; on NRS (37 %) in group 2. No meaningful clinical improvement was detected in group 3 on NRS and RMDQ. <b>Lumbar</b> <b>support</b> compliance was 52. 1 % in groups 1 and 2. Compliance was positively correlated with patients’ pre-treatment positive beliefs about the <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> and negatively side effects of <b>lumbar</b> <b>support.</b> Conclusion: In chronic low back pain patients, extension-controlled <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> or elastic <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> usage in addition to classical medical treatment is better than classical medical treatment alone in terms of pain intensity in short term. Extension-controlled <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> improves back-specific disability.

40|$|Modern {{car seats}} are often {{equipped}} with adjustable <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> for reducing fatigue and improving ride comfort in different driving conditions. Studies {{on the effect}} of <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> on seat dynamic performance and ride comfort are not often seen. This experimental study was designed to investigate how <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> affects static and dynamic characteristics of the driver seat of a sport utility vehicle. The load-deflection curves of the backrest cushion of the car seat were measured in three extra <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> conditions (regarded as “No”, “Half” and “Full” <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports).</b> The acceleration transmissibilities to the backrest and to the seat pan in the fore-and-aft direction with different <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> conditions were measured with 8 male subjects exposed to random fore-and-aft vibration from 1 to 30 Hz with three magnitudes (0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0 ms- 2 r. m. s), using a Multi-Axis Simulation Table. It was found that the lumbar area of the backrest became stiffer with increased extra <b>lumbar</b> <b>support.</b> The peak at the resonance of the acceleration transmissibility from the seat base to the backrest decreased, while that in the transmissibility from the seat base to the seat pan increased, when increasing the <b>lumbar</b> <b>support.</b> The softening effect was also apparent with increasing vibration magnitude.

40|$|Study Design. A {{systematic}} review and meta-analysis {{of studies on}} the putative mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> in lifting activities. Objective. To summarize the evidence bearing on the putative mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports.</b> Summary of Background Data. A restriction of trunk motion {{and a reduction in}} required back muscle forces in lifting are two proposed mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports.</b> Available studies on these putative mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> have reported contradictory results. Methods. A literature search for controlled studies on mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> was conducted. The methodologic quality of the studies was assessed. The evidence for the two proposed mechanisms of action of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> was determined in meta-analyses. Results. Thirty-three studies were selected for the review. There was evidence that <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> reduce trunk motion for flexion-extension and lateral bending, with overall effect sizes of 0. 70 (95 % confidence interval [Cl] 0. 39 - 1. 01) and 1. 13 (95 % Cl 0. 17 - 2. 08), respectively. The overall effect size for rotation was not statistically significant (0. 69; 95 % Cl - 0. 40 - 4. 31). There was no evidence that <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> reduce the electromyogram activity of erector spinae muscles (effect size of 0. 09; 95 % Cl - 0. 41 - 0. 59) or increase the intra-abdominal pressure (effect size of 0. 26; 95 % Cl - 0. 07 - 0. 59). Conclusion. There is evidence that <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> reduce trunk motion for flexion-extension and latera bending. More research is needed on the separate outcome measures for trunk motion before definite conclusions can be drawn about the work conditions in which <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> may be most effective.

Indirect costs were &OV 0556; 255 (US$ 288) lower, but this was not statistically significant (95 % CI, - 879 to 299). Conclusion. : <b>Lumbar</b> <b>support</b> seems to be a cost-effective addition to usual care for home care workers with recurrent LBP. For estimating the LBP-related indirect costs, it would be more precise when an objective measure for LBP-related sick leave would have been available. There is a need for more evidence to confirm these findings, also in other working populations. © 2010, Lippincott Williams & Wilkins...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} gain a {{competitive}} edge in the market, automotive manufacturers and automotive seat suppliers have identified seat ergonomics for further development to improve overall vehicle comfort. Adjustable <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> devices have been offered since long as comfort systems in either a 2 -way or 4 -way adjustable configuration, although their effect on lumbar strain is not well documented. The effect of a <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> on posture and muscular strain, and therefore the relationship between discomfort and comfort device parameter settings, requires clarification. The aim {{of this paper is}} to study the effect of a 4 -way <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> on lower trunk and pelvis muscle activity, pelvic tilt and spine curvature during a car seating activity. 10 healthy subjects (5 m/f; age 19 - 39) performed a seating activity in a passenger vehicle with seven different static <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> positions. The <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> was tested in 3 different height positions in relation to the seatback surface centreline (high, centre, low), each having 2 depths positions (lumbar prominence). An extra depth position was added for the centre position. Posture data were collected using a VICON MX motion capture system and NORAXON DTS goniometers and inclinometer. A rigid-body model of an adjustable car seat with four-way adjustable <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> was constructed in UGS Siemens NX and connected to a musculoskeletal model of a seated-human, modelled in AnyBody. Wireless electromyography (EMG) was used to calibrate the musculoskeletal model and assess the relationship between (a) muscular strain and lumbar prominence (normal to seatback surface) respective to the lumbar height (alongside seatback surface), (b) hip joint moment and lumbar prominence (normal to seatback surface) respective to lumbar height (alongside seatback surface) and (c) pelvic tilt and lumbar prominence (normal to seatback surface) respective to the lumbar height (alongside seatback surface). This study was based on the assumption that the musculoskeletal human model was seated at the correct R-Point (SgRP), determined via the occupant packaging toolkit in the JACK digital human model. The effect of the interaction between the driver/car-seat has been investigated for factors resulting from the presence and adjustment of a 4 -way <b>lumbar</b> <b>support.</b> The results obtained show that various seat adjustments, and driver’s <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> can have complex influence on the muscle activation, joint forces and moments, all of which can affect the comfort perception of the driver. This study enables the automotive industry to optimise passenger vehicle seat development and design. It further more supports the evaluation of static postural and dynamic seat comfort in normal everyday driving tasks and can be applied for future car design to reduce investment and improve comfort...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{effectiveness}} of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports,</b> education, and exercise {{in the prevention of}} back pain in industry. METHODS: A computerised search for controlled clinical trials was conducted. A criteria list was used to assess the methodological quality of the studies. The available evidence for {{the effectiveness of}} the interventions was graded with a rating system for the level of evidence. Effect sizes of individual studies were combined if the studies were sufficiently similar. RESULTS: 11 studies were identified for the review. The methodological quality of all studies was low, with a maximum score of three out of seven for internal validity. There was no evidence for the effectiveness of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports</b> due to contradictory outcomes of the studies. Five of the six studies on education reported no effect. Thus there is limited evidence that education does not help to prevent back pain. All three studies on exercise reported a positive result, indicating limited evidence for the effectiveness of exercise. The combined effect size for exercise was 0. 53, which is a medium sized effect. CONCLUSIONS: Although widely used, there is little evaluative research on the preventive measures studied here. The review showed that there is limited evidence that exercise has some effect in the prevention of back pain and that education is not effective. No conclusive evidence was found for or against the effectiveness of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports.</b> Research of higher methodological quality is needed before firm conclusions on the effectiveness of <b>lumbar</b> <b>supports,</b> education, and exercise in the prevention of back pain in industry can be drawn...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} backward adjustable thoracic support on spinal curvature and back muscle activation during wheelchair sitting. Twenty elderly people were recruited for this study. The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting posture was compared with the slumped, normal, and <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> sitting postures. Spinal curvatures (pelvic, lumbar, and thoracic angles) and muscle activations of 4 back muscles on both sides (maximal voluntary isometric contraction of the lumbar multifidus, lumbar erector spinae, iliocostalis lumborum pars thoracis, and thoracic erector spinae at T 9) were measured and compared between the different sitting postures using {{one-way analysis of variance}} with repeated measures. The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting posture showed a relatively neutral pelvic tilt (- 0. 32 ± 4. 80 °) when compared with the slumped (22. 84 ± 5. 27 °) and <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> (- 8. 97 ± 3. 31 °) sitting postures (P< 0. 001), and showed relatively higher lumbar lordosis (- 23. 38 ± 6. 50 °) when compared with the slumped (14. 77 ± 7. 83 °), normal (0. 44 ± 7. 47 °), and <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> (- 16. 76 ± 4. 77 °) sitting postures (P< 0. 05). It also showed relatively lower back muscle activity when compared with the normal and <b>lumbar</b> <b>support</b> sitting postures (P< 0. 05). The backward adjustable thoracic support sitting concept was suggested because it maintains a more neutral pelvic tilt, higher lumbar lordosis, and lower back muscle activation, which may help maintain a better sitting posture and reduce the risk of back pain...|$|R
