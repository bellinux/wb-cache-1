25|$|The {{development}} {{of the concept of}} chance throughout history has been very gradual. Historians have wondered why progress in the field of randomness was so slow, given that humans have encountered chance since antiquity. Deborah Bennett suggests that ordinary people face an inherent difficulty in understanding randomness, although the concept is often taken as being obvious and self-evident. She cites studies by Kahneman and Tversky; these concluded that statistical principles are not learned from everyday experience <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not attend to the detail necessary to gain such knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Another {{contention}} was Nurkse's {{approval of}} Say's Law, which theorises {{that there is}} no overproduction or glut in the economy. Supply (production of goods and services) creates a matching demand for the output and this results in the entire output being sold and consumed. However, Keynes stated that Say's Law is not operational in any country <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not spend their entire income - a fraction of it is saved for future consumption. Thus, according to Nurkse's critics, his assumption of Say's Law being operational in underdeveloped countries needs greater justification. Even if the section of savers is few, the [...] tenet of [...] putting emphasis on supply rather than demand has been widely discredited.|$|E
2500|$|The {{experience}} of [...] in the UK is that medicines prescribed for preventative purposes are especially likely {{not to be}} taken as prescribed; perhaps <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not feel immediately threatened or, in the case of symptomless conditions such as raised cholesterol levels (hypercholesterolaemia) and raised blood pressure (systemic hypertension), feel no obvious benefits at the time of taking the medicines [...] As patients are asymptomatic, they may not see a need to take medication.|$|E

2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{layers of}} Vedic text incorporate {{the concept of}} life, followed by an afterlife in heaven and hell based on cumulative virtues (merit) or vices (demerit). However, the ancient Vedic Rishis challenged this idea of afterlife as simplistic, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not live an equally moral or immoral life. Between generally virtuous lives, some are more virtuous; while evil too has degrees, and the texts assert {{that it would be}} unfair for people, with varying degrees of virtue or vices, to end up in heaven or hell, in [...] "either or" [...] and disproportionate manner irrespective of how virtuous or vicious their lives were. They introduced the idea of an afterlife in heaven or hell in proportion to one's merit, and when this runs out, one returns and is reborn. This idea appears in ancient and medieval texts, as the cycle of life, death, rebirth and redeath, such as section 6:31 of the Mahabharata and section 6.10 of Devi Bhagavata Purana.|$|E

The Saṃsara, the life after death, and what impacts rebirth came to be seen as dependent on karma.|$|E

5000|$|The title character's name is said in {{the story}} to have derived from a common text for youngsters to {{practice}} calligraphy, which has no actual meaning, being purely a collection of characters for practice. The three characters were the 4th to 6th characters in the text, and it was used <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not know his name other than that his surname was [...] "Kong".

2500|$|While many {{agreements}} can be certain, {{it is by}} {{no means}} certain that in the case of social and domestic affairs people want their agreements to be legally binding. In Balfour v Balfour Atkin LJ held that Mr Balfour's agreement to pay his wife £30 a month while he worked in Ceylon should be presumed unenforceable, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not generally intend such promises in the social sphere to create legal consequences. Similarly, an agreement between friends at a pub, or a daughter and her mother will fall into this sphere, but not a couple who are on the verge of separation, and not friends engaged in big transactions, particularly where one side relies heavily to their detriment on the assurances of the other. This presumption of unenforceability can always be rebutted by express agreement otherwise, for instance by writing the deal down. By contrast, agreements made among businesses are almost conclusively presumed to be enforceable. But again, express words, such as [...] "This arrangement... shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the law courts" [...] will be respected. In one situation, statute presumes that collective agreements between a trade union and an employer are not intended to create legal relations, ostensibly to keep excessive litigation away from UK labour law.|$|E

60|$|The men {{who were}} off duty went ashore, and lay down, but were ordered, for caution's sake, not to stray, and to keep within view. The others rested on their oars, and dozed. Awnings {{had been made of}} one thing and another, in all the boats, and the {{passengers}} found it cooler to be under them in the shade, when there was room enough, than to be in the thick woods. So, the passengers were all afloat, and mostly sleeping. I kept my post behind Miss Maryon, and she was on Captain Carton's right in the boat, and Mrs. Fisher sat on her right again. The Captain had Mrs. Fisher's daughter on his knee. He and the two ladies were talking about the Pirates, and were talking softly; partly, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> talk softly under such indolent circumstances, and partly because the little girl had gone off asleep.|$|E
25|$|Cited as {{evidence}} is his gradual ostracism {{of those who}} contributed to his success, such as Sidney James and his scriptwriters, Galton and Simpson. His reasoning was that, to refine his craft, he had to ditch catch-phrases and become realistic. He argued, for example, that whenever an ad-hoc character was needed, such as a policeman, it would be played by someone like Kenneth Williams, who would appear with his well-known oily catchphrase 'Good evening'. Hancock believed the comedy suffered <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not believe in the policeman, knowing it was just Williams doing a funny voice.|$|R

They didn’t do it for a fee or to sit on my board or to be a paid advisor. They did it because they had something to give back to the community. It’s that simple; someone did it for me and I just feel like the only way I can thank those individuals… is to give back to those early stage companies.|$|R
6000|$|Thus, I {{have much}} to say of the cliffs of Grindelwald and the Chartreuse, but all so {{dependent}} upon certain facts belonging to pine vegetation, that I am compelled to defer it to the next volume; nor do I much regret this; because it seems to me that, without any setting forth, or rather beyond all setting forth, the Alpine precipices have a fascination about them which is sufficiently felt by the spectator in general, and even by the artist; only they have not been properly drawn, <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>do</b> not usually attribute the magnificence of their effect to the trifling details which really are its elements; and, therefore, in common drawings of Swiss scenery we see all kinds of efforts at sublimity by exaggeration of the projection of the mass, or by obscurity, or blueness or aerial tint,--by everything, in fact, except the one needful thing,--plain drawing of the rock. Therefore in this chapter I have endeavored to direct the reader to a severe mathematical estimate of precipice outline, and to make him dwell, not on the immediately pathetic or impressive aspect of cliffs, which all men feel readily enough, but on their internal structure. For he may rest assured that, as the Matterhorn is built of mica flakes, so every great pictorial impression in scenery of this kind is to be reached by little and little; the cliff must be built in the picture as it was probably in reality--inch by inch; and the work will, in the end, have most power which was begun with most patience. No man is fit to paint Swiss scenery until he can place himself front to front with one of those mighty crags, in broad daylight, with no [...] "effect" [...] to aid him, and work it out, boss by boss, only with such conventionality as its infinitude renders unavoidable. We have seen that a literal facsimile is impossible, just as a literal facsimile of the carving of an entire cathedral front is impossible. But it is as vain to endeavor to give any conception of an Alpine cliff without minuteness of detail, and by mere breadth of effect, as it would be to give a conception of the façades of Rouen or Rheims, without indicating any statues or foliation. When the statues and foliation are once got, as much blue mist and thundercloud as you choose, but not before.|$|E

50|$|As {{with most}} films about the Titanic {{made before the}} {{discovery}} of the wreck in 1985, the film portrays the ship as sinking in one piece, when in fact, the Titanic broke into two pieces as it sank. This is <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not believe that Titanic split. Even though survivors remember seeing the ship split, White Star Line denied it, as if it was true, the public would not think the Olympic-Class liners were structurally sound. The split was proven in 1985 when the bow and stern were found in two pieces, about a third of a mile (600 m) apart, at a depth of about 12,500 feet (3,800 m).|$|R

Another source of conflict arose when {{a group of people who}} constituted a minority in one nation would seek to secede from the nation either to form an independent nation or join another nation with whom they felt stronger ties. Yet another source of conflict was the desire of some nations to expel people from territory within its borders <b>because</b> <b>people</b> <b>did</b> not share a common bond with the majority of people of that nation.|$|R

The government of the Russian Federation continues to own State dachas (...) for use by the [...] president and by other officials.
