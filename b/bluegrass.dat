5|$|Warner was an {{aspiring}} <b>bluegrass</b> musician (which was unusual in Australia) after {{learning of the}} music from his father, an early Australian <b>bluegrass</b> pioneer. The winner of the Australian National <b>Bluegrass</b> Mandolin Championship for four consecutive years, Warner had toured with country music artists including Gina Jeffreys, and with Young in Kasey Chambers's band. Young and Warner knew each other previously, and according to Warner, had been drawn to <b>bluegrass</b> and American roots music through an appreciation of George Jones and Merle Haggard. Warner and Young {{made the decision to}} emigrate to America to pursue musical careers in that country, after they met. Young and Warner later lived together in Sydney while trying to find work in the moribund Australian <b>bluegrass</b> scene. After leaving Australia, they spent time in West Texas before relocating to Austin.|$|E
5|$|Athens is {{near the}} Blue Ridge Mountains area of North Georgia; this is an {{important}} region in the development of several varieties of folk music, including the Appalachian <b>bluegrass</b> style and the Piedmont blues. North Georgia's <b>bluegrass</b> heritage {{can be traced back to}} the 19th century, when <b>bluegrass</b> was a nascent style throughout Appalachia and North Georgia was home to major fiddling contests, beginning in the 1880s. A 1983 recording expedition by Art and Margo Rosenbaum documented the continued existence of many forms of folk music, including work songs, string bands, African American hymns and spirituals, banjo tunes and unaccompanied ballads; the collection includes a chapter devoted to Doc and Lucy Barnes of Athens. Athens' modern contributions to the field of <b>bluegrass</b> include the Packway Handle Band and BlueBilly Grit.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{called the}} Grammy Award for Best <b>Bluegrass</b> Recording (Vocal or Instrumental), the award was first {{presented}} to Bill Monroe in 1989. In 1990 and 1991 the category was renamed Best <b>Bluegrass</b> Recording, and in 1990 the award {{was reserved for}} singles rather than albums. Since 1992, the award has been presented under the category Best <b>Bluegrass</b> Album. Beginning in 1993, award recipients often included the producers, engineers, and/or mixers associated with the nominated work {{in addition to the}} recording artists. In 1995 and 1997, producers of compilation albums were the only award recipients.|$|E
5|$|As a yearling, Oxbow {{was sent}} to the Keeneland sales, where he was {{purchased}} for $250,000 by bloodstock agent Eddie Kane, acting on behalf of Brad M. Kelley's <b>Bluegrass</b> Hall. In 2012, the Calumet Investment Group bought Calumet Farm and leased it to Kelley, who moved his <b>Bluegrass</b> Hall racing operation and 200 horses from his Hurricane Hill farm to the historic Calumet property in early 2013. Prior to 2013, Calumet Farm had not had a winning horse in a Triple Crown race since 1968.|$|E

5|$|Native grasses {{thrive in}} many parts of the {{monument}} despite competition from medusahead rye, Dalmatian toadflax, cheatgrass, and other invasive species. Bunchgrasses in the park include basin wildrye, Idaho fescue, Thurber's needlegrass, Indian ricegrass, and bottlebrush squirreltail, among others. Native grasses that form sod in parts of the monument include Sandberg's <b>bluegrass</b> and other <b>bluegrass</b> species. Reed canary grass, if mowed, also forms sod along stream banks.|$|E

Bog <b>bluegrass</b> occurs {{at the bottom of a}} ravine in the Pine Bush and is the only place in the New York Bight {{watershed}} where this plant appears. Bayard's malaxis (Malaxis bayardii) is a rare orchid that occurs in the Pine Bush as well.|$|E
5|$|Both Axel Rudi Pell (on Diamonds Unlocked) and Hayseed Dixie (on Killer Grass) {{covered the}} song in their {{established}} styles of metal and <b>bluegrass</b> respectively. Richie Havens covered the track on his 2008 album, Nobody Left to Crown, playing the song at a slower tempo to the original.|$|E
5|$|Jeff Beal's {{score is}} {{primarily}} acoustic sounding electronics, but mixes themes of <b>bluegrass</b> {{as well as}} atmospheric rhythmic sounds. Bigger groups of strings support smaller ensembles of guitars, pianos, violins, cellos, and trumpets. The music sometimes uses ethnic instruments such as banjos, harmonicas, ukuleles, and duduks.|$|E

5|$|In {{several other}} locations, {{the tree is}} absent from large areas but still present in a few {{specific}} habitats. An example is the <b>Bluegrass</b> region of Kentucky, where red maple is {{not found in the}} dominant open plains, but is present along streams. Here the red maple is not present in the bottom land forests of the Grain Belt, despite the fact it is common in similar habitats and species associations both to the north and south of this area.|$|E
5|$|Russian olive and {{tamarisk}} or salt cedar trees now {{dominate the}} Jordan River floodplain where willow trees and cottonwood trees would {{once have been}} found. Plant species such as foxtail barley, saltgrass, rabbitbrush, cattails and other reeds are still found in small pockets along the river. Exotic pasture grasses such as orchard grass, <b>bluegrass,</b> redtop bentgrass, quackgrass, wheatgrass and fescue have become the common species of grass. The vulnerable flower, Ute's Ladies'-tresses, {{can also be found}} along the river.|$|E
5|$|Sagebrush {{typically}} dominates drier, non-forested {{areas at}} lower elevations. Species that commonly occur with sagebrush include Sandberg <b>bluegrass,</b> wild onion, milk vetches, bluebunch wheatgrass, bitterbrush, gray horsebrush, green rabbitbrush, and others. In riparian areas below , trees such as black cottonwood, narrowleaf cottonwood, thinleaf alder, water birch, and mountain maple grow with shrubs including chokeberry and willows. Riparian areas in largely treeless habitats such as sagebrush steppe primarily consist of willows along with thinleaf alder, chokecherry, mountain maple, shrubby cinquefoil, fireweed, saxifrage, and grasses.|$|E
5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare is a herbivore, {{and mostly}} feeds on moorland grasses such as bentgrass (Agrostis), goosegrass (Eleusine), Festuca, fountaingrass (Pennisetum) and <b>bluegrass</b> (Poa). At such altitudes {{in which the}} Ethiopian highland hare lives, {{it is expected to}} reproduce in dry seasons. The female produces one offspring per breeding season. Not much has been recorded about its reproduction and behavior.|$|E
5|$|The Greencards {{gained more}} fans and became known by name quickly {{after the release}} of Movin' On. The band was {{credited}} with performing the most energetic sets {{during the course of the}} 2004 Austin City Limits Music Festival, were said to bring a global sound to <b>bluegrass,</b> and—by drawing on influences such as Bob Dylan and The Beatles—were pushing the genre's boundaries. Their live show during this period was ranked by the Houston Chronicle in the top five nights of live music for the year in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The album {{peaked at}} #17 on the Billboard 200, Nickel Creek's highest {{position}} on the chart to date.

The album earned Nickel Creek two Grammy Award nominations: the award for Best Contemporary Folk Album, an award which they previously won for This Side, and the award for Best Country Instrumental Performance ("Scotch & Chocolate").|$|E
5|$|The ironic {{thing is}} that we grew up {{listening}} to primarily American music {{and fell in love with}} American music. I love country music. I grew up with George Jones and Charley Pride and Jim Reeves. All that stuff was playing in the house. That's what I wanted to seek out. That's what I wanted to play. Carol was into Tammy Wynette. Trev Warner is Kym's dad, and he was the first person to bring <b>bluegrass</b> music to Australia.|$|E
5|$|After {{planting}} the vineyards and vinting wines, Romito opened the Mount Hope Estate and Winery in 1980. To promote his new business the first year, Romito hosted several events including an art show, a <b>bluegrass</b> concert, a fifties revival, a country-western weekend, a classical orchestra concert, and a one-day modern jousting tournament. The jousting tournament {{was so popular}} that Romito held a two-day renaissance festival the following year in the winery's parking lot, and gradually expanded this into a permanent attraction, the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. The property was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and in 1991 the boundaries were increased {{as part of the}} Iron and Steel Resources of Pennsylvania Multiple Property Submission (MPS).|$|E

5|$|Athens' local country {{scene has}} never been as {{significant}} as the profusion of indie rock bands; however, modern Athens rock takes many elements from the folk, <b>bluegrass</b> and country traditions, including such bands as the Normaltown Flyers. The band Drive-By Truckers, and the , have done much {{in recent years to}} make country rock a major part of Athens' musical identity. Recent bands such as The Broken String Band have emerged influenced by the folk rock genre. The rapper Bubba Sparxxx, originally from South Georgia, has also helped diversify Athens' country heritage, by adding a rural image and elements of country music to his Dirty South style of hip hop music.|$|E

The style of the band, a mixture of Country and Western and <b>Bluegrass</b> music, was often not well received.|$|E
5|$|Many American {{cities and}} towns have vibrant music scenes which, in turn, support a number of {{regional}} musical styles. Along with musical centers such as Philadelphia, Seattle, Portland, New York City, San Francisco, New Orleans, Detroit, Minneapolis, Chicago, Miami, Atlanta, Nashville, Austin, and Los Angeles, many smaller cities such as Asbury Park, New Jersey have produced distinctive styles of music. The Cajun and Creole traditions in Louisiana music, the folk and popular styles of Hawaiian music, and the <b>bluegrass</b> and old time music of the Southeastern states are {{a few examples of}} diversity in American music. Modern day music is heavily influenced by previous and present African-American music genres.|$|E
5|$|Much {{of modern}} popular music can trace its roots to the {{emergence}} in the late 19th century of African American blues {{and the growth of}} gospel music in the 1920s. The African American basis for popular music used elements derived from European and indigenous musics. There are also strong African roots in the music tradition of the original white settlers, such as country and <b>bluegrass.</b> The United States has also seen documented folk music and recorded popular music produced in the ethnic styles of the Ukrainian, Irish, Scottish, Polish, Hispanic, and Jewish communities, among others.|$|E
