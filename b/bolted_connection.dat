40|$|Abstract—Bolt {{connection}} {{is one of}} the common connection methods in diesel engine. The {{purpose of this study is}} to verify the difference of considering the <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> or not in the shock response calculation. The methods applying in the study as following: first design the comparison test of welding <b>connection</b> and <b>bolt</b> connection; establish the diesel engine’s fasten component model of considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> and model without considering bolt connection; then calculate the shock response of the two kinds of model by DDAM method; and finally coupling the shock response in three direction. The above tests reach the result that: the natural frequency of model without considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> is higher than that of the model considering bolt connection; the rigid connection area will easily produce stress concentration; and the stress concentration can be effectively reduced by considering <b>bolt</b> <b>connection.</b> Therefore, the study suggest that <b>bolt</b> <b>connection</b> should be considered in the study of shock response calculation of diesel engine frequency domain.

50|$|Clark then {{examined}} the prosecution history and prior art of {{both sets of}} patents involved in the case. In the Graham case, the '798 patent was originally rejected by the patent examiner as being insufficiently distinguished from the previous '811 patent. The only two claims which differed between the two patents were (1) the stirrup and the <b>bolted</b> <b>connection</b> of the shank to the hinge plate do not appear in '811; and (2) {{the position of the}} shank is reversed, being placed in patent '811 above the hinge plate, sandwiched between it and the upper plate. One argument which Graham raised before the court, but had not raised before the USPTO, was that in the new '798 design, the flexing of the plow shank was limited to the points between the spring clamp and the tip of the plow shank, absorbing the shock of hard objects on the ground more efficiently. The court rejected this argument and invalidated the '798 patent for two reasons: first, Graham had not raised this “flexing” argument before the USPTO, and second, the parts in the '798 patent served the same purposes as those in the prior art.|$|E

Furthermore, it was shown (Chung and Ip. Proceedings of the Second European Conference on Steel Structures, Praha, May 1999, p. 503 - 506) that stress-strain curves, contact stiffnesses and frictional coefficients between element interfaces, and clamping forces developed in bolt shanks were important parameters for accurate prediction of the deformation characteristics of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections.</b> This paper presents an extension of the finite element investigation onto the structural behaviour of cold-formed steel <b>bolted</b> <b>connections,</b> and three distinctive failure modes (Ip and Chung. Proceeding of the Second International Conference on Advances in Steel Structures, Hong Kong, December 1999) as observed in lap shear tests are successfully modelled: bearing failure; shear-out failure; and net-section failure. Furthermore, a parametric study on <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> with different configurations is performed to provide bearing resistances for practical design, and the results of the {{finite element model}}ling are also compared with four codified design rules.

40|$|The {{structural}} behaviour {{of single}} shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections,</b> double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> and single shear screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures {{has been investigated}} in this study. The current design rules on <b>bolted</b> and screwed <b>connections</b> of thin sheet steels for cold-formed steel structures are applicable for ambient temperature condition only. These design rules may not be applicable for elevated temperature conditions. Therefore, design guidelines should be prepared for <b>bolted</b> and screwed <b>connections</b> of cold-formed steel structures at elevated temperatures. A total of 30 tensile coupon tests were conducted to investigate the material deterioration of the thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures, and also to determine the critical temperatures for connection tests. A total of 510 tests on single shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections,</b> double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> and single shear screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures was performed in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C using both steady state and transient state test methods. The test results were compared with the predicted values calculated from the North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications for coldformed steel structures. In calculating the nominal strengths of the connections, the reduced material properties of the thin sheet steels were used due to the deterioration of material at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the design strengths predicted by these specifications are generally conservative at elevated temperatures. Finite element models for single shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections,</b> double shear <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> and single shear screwed connections were developed and verified against the experimental results. Explicit dynamic analysis technique {{was used in the}} numerical analyses. Extensive parametric studies that included 490 finite element specimens were carried out using the verified finite element models to evaluate the bearing strengths of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures. Design equations for bearing strengths of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> as well as design equations for tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections were proposed based on both the experimental and the numerical results in the temperature ranged from 22 to 900 ?C. The bearing strengths of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections obtained from the test specimens and the finite element analyses were compared with the predicted strengths calculated using the proposed design equations and also compared with the design strengths calculated using the current North American, Australian/New Zealand and European specifications with consideration of the reduced material properties at elevated temperatures. It is shown that the proposed design equations are generally more accurate and reliable in predicting the bearing strengths of <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> as well as the tilting and bearing strengths of screwed connections of thin sheet steels at elevated temperatures than the current design rules.

The composite highway bridge is composed of reinforced concrete deck over five simply supported spans of structural steelwork. The structural steelwork includes five main UB girders connected to diaphragms and horizontal bracings by HSFG <b>bolted</b> <b>connections.</b> Initial inspection of the bridge found {{that a number of}} bolts were loosened, missing or had already fractured and most were heavily corroded. Remedial works in which the original <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> have been replaced and the new ones ensured to be installed at the correct tension have been recently completed.  The structural and environmental factors that {{may have contributed to the}} eventual failure of the bolts have been investigated. The design adequacy of the <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> compared to the externally applied loads on the bridge superstructure was checked in accordance with current standards: AS 5100 and AS 4100. The failure mechanisms of the fractured bolts were investigated. The residual loads on the original bolts have been identified through slip testing on both the original bolts and new HSFG bolts in double shear configuration. The fractured bolts were analysed through optical and scanned electron microscopy. The design fatigue life of the bolts were identified through fatigue testing of the M 16 bolts in double shear configuration and the M 22 bolts subjected to cyclic tensile load. The difference of the rate of corrosion of the bolts with and without the zinc plate corrosion protection was also identified.  It was found that the main factors the contributed to the failure of the <b>bolted</b> <b>connections</b> at the Mary River Bridge include overstressing of the bolts, the fluctuating loads, the eventual abrasion and wear of the corrosive protection and the corrosive environment it was subjected to.
