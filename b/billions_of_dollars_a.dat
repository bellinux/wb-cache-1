25|$|Species within Orobanchaceae (broomrapes) {{are some}} of the most {{economically}} destructive species on Earth. Species of Striga (witchweeds) are estimated to cost <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> year in crop yield loss annually, infesting over 50 million hectares of cultivated land within Sub-Saharan Africa alone. Striga infects both grasses and grains, including corn, rice and Sorghum, undoubtedly some of the most important food crops. Orobanche also threatens a wide range of important crops, including peas, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots, and varieties of the genus Brassica (cabbages). Yield loss from Orobanche can reach 100%; despite extensive research, no method of control has been entirely successful.|$|E

2500|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry has revenues {{in the hundreds}} of <b>billions</b> <b>of</b> <b>dollars</b> <b>a</b> year globally. [...] With such a large industry counterfeiting and copyright infringement are serious issues, and hydrogen isotope fingerprinting has become a useful tool in verifying the authenticity of various drugs. [...] As described in the preceding sections, the utility of D/H ratios highest when combined with measurements of other isotope ratios as well. [...] In an early study on the stable isotope compositions of tropicamide, hydrocortisone, quinine and tryptophan, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen stable isotopes were analyzed by EA-IRMS and clear distinctions were able to be made between manufacturers and even batches of the drugs based on their isotope signatures. [...] In this study it was determined that the hydrogen and oxygen isotope ratios were the two best fingerprints for distinguishing between different drug sources. [...] A follow-up study analyzing naproxen from various lots and manufacturers also showed similar ability to distinguish between sources of the drugs. [...] The use of these isotope signatures could not only be used to distinguish between different manufacturers, but also between different synthetic pathways for the same compound. [...] These studies relied on the natural variations that occurred in the synthesis of these drugs, but other studies have used starting ingredients that are intentionally labelled D and 13C, and showed that these labels could be traced into the final pharmaceutical product. [...] D/H ratios can also be determined for specific sites in a drug by 2H NMR, and has been used to distinguish between different synthetic methods for ibuprofen and naproxen in one study, and prozac and fluoxetine in another. [...] These studies show that bulk D/H ratio information for EA-IRMS, and site-specific D/H ratios from 2H NMR have great utility for pharmaceutical drug authenticity testing.|$|E
