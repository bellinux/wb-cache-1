5|$|The legal Underbelly DVD was {{released}} 8 May 2008 by Roadshow Entertainment, {{a day after}} the final episode was aired on television. In accordance with the legal suppression, the release was not distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet. Roadshow Entertainment has confirmed that all box sets and point of sale displays will carry a sticker or stamp reminding buyers the series is not for sale, distribution or exhibition in Victoria. Legal experts said Victorians who bought the box set interstate and watched it themselves at home would likely not fall foul of the law, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> showed it more widely could be charged with contempt. The DVD has sold 265,000 copies around Australia. In September 2008, a Limited Edition DVD {{was released}}, containing a numbered steel case and an extra disc with a documentary entitled Carl Williams– A Day of Reckoning. The Underbelly soundtrack was released on 29 March 2008, both as a CD and online. It features elements of the score by Burkhard Dallwitz in addition to music tracks that were featured in the series. Underbelly was released on Blu-ray on 5 August 2010.|$|E

It {{was meant to}} be an {{opposition}} group within the Comintern, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> joined, or was suspected of joining, the ILO, was immediately expelled from the Comintern. The ILO therefore concluded that opposing Stalinism from within the Communist organizations controlled by Stalin's supporters had become impossible, so new organizations had to be formed. In 1933, the ILO was renamed the International Communist League (ICL), which formed the basis of the Fourth International, founded in Paris in 1938.|$|E

[...] His seventh album, Metal Up, a heavy metal compilation with some songs based on Irish folklore, topped the iTunes Metal chart for 2 days following its release in early 2015. Metal Up was described as mix of classic rock, hard rock, and metal, and was praised by Firstherd for its celtic influences in some songs which were [...] "very original when placed in a metal framework".

He {{started out with}} an act that involved sound-effect impressions, including guns, animals and a car boot. With this act he supported Jim Tavaré in Leeds in Winter 1992. In 1994-95, he was the drummer in the band Evangelista, the house band at Stewart Lee's and Simon Munnery's experimental Cluub Zarathustra in London.

500|$|Hatoful Boyfriend has {{received}} generally favorable reception, with reviewers {{focusing on the}} surprising depth of the game's writing and storyline. In a weekly game spotlight, Kouichi Kirishima from [...] recommends the game to [...] "not just pigeon-lovers, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> enjoys visual novels", remarking that the game is [...] "at times surprisingly serious and emotionally involved". On {{the other side of}} the Pacific, Julian Murdoch comments in a Gamers With Jobs analysis of the game that the scenarios featured in Hatoful are [...] "elaborate and multifaceted", and that Hato Moa herself [...] "isn’t just a storyteller, she’s actually a good storyteller". Hatoful Boyfriend was also named the best PC game of 2012 by GameCola; Paul Franzen explains the game's inclusion among higher budget and more technically sophisticated titles as being due to the strength of its storytelling and pathos, stating that [...] "Hatoful Boyfriend isn't just a weird game about heathen human-animal relationships [...] there’s an actual, serious, emotional game here, too". In an article discussing the E3 announcement of the 2014 remake, Carly Smith for The Escapist remarks that Hatoful Boyfriend is [...] "absolutely hilarious", but recommends that players [...] "start the game for a laugh, but stick with it for a ride you wouldn't have expected by looking at the cover".|$|E
500|$|Chapter six {{addresses}} {{the use of}} animals in entertainment. Cochrane does not oppose the practice of pet-keeping, and accepts that humans do {{have an interest in}} being able to keep pets, but that this interest is not so strong that it can be satisfied at any cost. He argues that pet-keeping should be regulated far more than it is, perhaps through the need for a license, the granting of which would be dependent on individuals proving their ability to care for the animal's well-being. Cochrane is open to euthanizing pets, but only in cases when medical care could not give them a chance at further good experiences. In these cases, providing medical care would be necessary (pet insurance could be a requirement for a license). Neutering pets is argued to be neither a violation of their rights nor a requirement, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> does not have their pets neutered would be required to ensure the wellbeing of any offspring. The same requirements as were established in the chapter on genetic engineering are applied to animal breeding, and Cochrane accepts that this may lead to the extinction of certain breeds. Concerning zoos and circuses, Cochrane argues that animals do not possess a right not to be kept or displayed, but they do possess a right not to be made to suffer. This imposes limitations on the kinds of animals which can be kept (for instance, large animals could not realistically be kept by traveling circuses), the conditions in which they are kept, and the nature of their performances. Hunting, cockfighting, dogfighting, bear baiting and bullfighting are condemned, as is, after some consideration, fishing. Cochrane is potentially open to greyhound and horse racing, or equestrianism generally, but says that [...] "the way that these sports are currently organized and practiced does involve the routine suffering and death of animals and ought to be condemned as such." [...] Such practices include suffering caused during training and racing, and the killing of animals past their peak or who do not display the requisite skills. Before concluding the chapter, Cochrane considers, but rejects, three possible objections to any use of animals in entertainment: first, by appeal to a concept of dignity, which use of the animals undermines; second, an appeal to disrespect, whether or not harm is caused; and third, that the use of animals in entertainment implies ownership, and animals have a right not to be considered property.|$|E

2500|$|The novel's title {{refers to}} a plot device that is {{repeatedly}} invoked in the story.

According to the novel, people who were crazy were not obliged to fly missions, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> applied to stop flying was showing a rational concern for his safety and was, therefore, sane and had to fly.

2500|$|AT was {{involved}} {{mainly in the}} telephone business and, {{although it was a}} partner with RCA, was reluctant to see radio grow because such growth might diminish the demand for wired services. It established station WEAF in New York as what was termed a toll station. AT could provide no programming, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> wished to broadcast a message could pay a [...] "toll" [...] to AT and then air the message publicly. The original studio {{was the size of a}} telephone booth. The idea, however, did not take hold, because people would pay to broadcast messages only if they were sure that someone was listening. As a result, WEAF began broadcasting entertainment material, drawing amateur talent found among its employees. Opposition to AT's expansion into radio and an agreement with the National Broadcasting Company to lease long distance lines for their broadcasts resulted in the sale of the station and its developing network of affiliates to NBC.|$|E

[...] After Chopin, Tansman may be the leading proponent of traditional Polish forms such as the polonaise and the mazurka; they were inspired by and often written in homage to Chopin. For these pieces, which ranged from lighthearted miniatures to virtuoso showpieces, Tansman drew on traditional Polish folk themes and adapted them to his distinctive neoclassical style. However, he did not write straight settings of the folk songs themselves, as he states in a radio interview: [...] "I have never used an actual Polish folk song in its original form, nor have I tried to reharmonize one. I find that modernizing a popular song spoils it. It must be preserved in its original harmonization." ...|$|E

David Owen, Foreign Secretary in the previous Labour government, was kinder in his interpretation. He said in Parliament that [...] "I do not agree with substantial parts of the Franks report, <b>but</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>who</b> pretends that the issue in 1982 was easy simply has not lived through such experience", and [...] "when I read the Franks report, I think 'There {{but for the grace of}} God go I'".|$|E
