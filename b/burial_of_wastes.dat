40|$|The {{objective}} of the Seismic Surface Wave Tomography of Waste Sites {{is to develop a}} robust technique for field acquisition and analysis of surface wave data for the interpretation of shallow structures, such as those associated with the <b>burial</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes.</b> The analysis technique is to be developed and tested on an existing set of seismic data covering the K- 901 burial site at the East Tennessee Technology Park. Also, a portable prototype for a field acquisition system will be designed and developed to obtain additional data for analysis and testing of the technique. The K- 901 data have been examined and a preliminary Single Valued Decomposition inversion has been obtained. The preliminary data indicates a need for additional seismic data to ground-truth the inversion. The originally proposed gravity data acquisition has been dropped because sufficient gravity data are now available for a preliminary analysis and because the seismic data are considered more critical to the interpretation. The proposed prototype for the portable acquisition and analysis system was developed during the first year and will be used in part of the acquisition of additional seismic data. ...|$|E
40|$|TOSPAC is a {{computer}} program that calculates partially saturated groundwater flow with the transport of water-soluble contaminants. TOSPAC Version 1 is restricted to calculations involving one-dimensional, vertical columns {{of one or more}} media. TOSPAC was developed to help answer questions surrounding the burial of toxic wastes in arid regions. <b>Burial</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> in arid regions is attractive because of generally low population densities and little groundwater flow, in the unsaturated zone, to disturb the waste. TOSPAC helps to quantify groundwater flow and the spread of contamination, offering an idea of what could happen in the distant future. Figure 1. 1 illustrates the problem TOSPAC was designed to investigate. For groundwater flow, TOSPAC can provide saturations, velocities, and and travel tunes for water in the rock matrix or the fractures in the unsaturated zone. TOSPAC can determine how hydrologic conditions vary when the rate of infiltration changes. For contaminant transport, TOSPAC can compute how much of a contaminant is dissolved in the water and how it is distributed. TOSPAC can determine how fast the solute is moving and the shape of the concentration front. And TOSPAC can be used to investigate how much of the contaminant remains in the inventory of a repository, how much is adsorbed onto the soil or rock matrix, and how much reaches the water table. Effective use of TOSPAC requires knowledge in a number of diverse disciplines, including real groundwater flow and transport, the mathematical models of groundwater flow and transport, real-world data required for the models, and the numerical solution of differential equations. Equally important is a realization of the limitations intrinsic to {{a computer}} model of complex physical phenomena. This User`s Guide not only describes the mechanics of executing TOSPAC on a computer, but also examines these other topics...|$|E

Also, a portable prototype for a field acquisition system will be designed and developed to obtain additional data for analysis and testing of the technique. The portable analysis system will display an image representing the shear-wave velocity structure. The image would be developed in the field from successive data samples. As of May 1998, the author established compatibility with computer programs at Georgia Tech and computed a preliminary singular value decomposition solution for the K- 901 data. The analysis included modeling of surface wave dispersion and analysis of velocity structure. The analysis demonstrated that the authors needed additional field data to verify the conclusions and provide independent confirmation of velocity structure. The K- 901 site data were obtained with 8 Hz geophones. The frequencies below 8 Hz are strongly attenuated in such recording instruments and are difficult to analyze. In particular, group velocities can have multiple answers for a given frequency. Consequently, without a record of the low-frequency energy, the authors found it difficult to identify the portion of the dispersion curve responsible for the seismogram. In particular, it was difficult to determine if the reverse dispersion observed in the frequencies above 8 Hz was caused by a low velocity layer or caused by observing only the frequencies above the group velocity minimum. In either model, synthetic seismograms can be made to match the observed data for the higher frequencies. The contract for the proposed work was completed in December. The field work was completed in March. The pending final report from William Doll at the Oak Ridge National Lab. will provide background information on the test site and new uphole and seismic refraction data and interpretation for use in confirming the tomographic inversion. ...|$|E

40|$|Contaminated {{groundwater}} {{and surface}} waters {{are a problem}} throughout the US and the world. In many instances, the types of contamination can be directly attributed to man''s actions. For instance, the <b>burial</b> <b>of</b> <b>wastes,</b> casual disposal of solvents in unlined pits, {{and the development of}} irrigated agriculture have all contributed to groundwater and surface water contamination. The kinds of contaminants include chlorinated solvents and toxic trace elements that are soluble and mobile in soils and aquifers. Oxyanions of selenium, chromium, uranium, arsenic, and chlorine (as perchlorate) are frequently found as contaminants on many DOE sites. In addition, the careless disposal of cleaning solvents, such as carbon tetrachloride and trichloroethylene, has further contaminated many groundwaters at these sites. Oxyanions of selenium, nitrogen, arsenic, vanadium, uranium, chromium, and molybdenum are contaminants in agricultural areas of the Western US. The management of these waters requires treatment to remove the contaminants before reuse or surface water disposal. In one instance in the Central Valley of California, the discharge of selenate-contaminated shallow groundwater to a wildlife refuge caused catastrophic bird deaths and deformities of embryos. A potential remediation method for many of these oxyanions and chlorinated-solvents is to react the contaminated water with zero-valent iron. In this reaction, the iron serves as both an electron source and as a catalyst. Elemental iron is already being used on an experimental basis. Both in-situ reactive barriers and above-ground reactors are being developed for this purpose. However, the design and operation of these treatment systems requires a detailed process-level understanding of the interactions between the contaminants and the iron surfaces. Only limited success has been achieved in the field, partly because the basic surface chemical reactions are not well understood. The authors are performing fundamental investigations of the interactions of the relevant chlorinated solvents, and trace element-containing compounds with single- and poly-crystalline Fe surfaces.

The activity concentrations of 226 Ra and 228 Ra in scales and sludges covers a broad range; from normal levels in soils and rocks (less than 1 Bq/g) up to more than 1000 Bq/g. Generally, the activity concentrations are lower in porous deposits and sludges than in scales. The activity concentration of 210 Pb is relatively low in hard deposits but may reach levels of thousands of Bq/g in sludges and in the very thin layers found in gas production. Huge amounts <b>of</b> NORM <b>waste</b> exceeding the exemption level of 10 Bq/g of 226 Ra and 228 Ra are generated as a result of both onsite and offsite decontamination of tubulars and different types of topside equipment. Onsite decontamination is the preferred option when components cannot reasonably be removed and replaced or need no other treatment before re-installation or continued use. One example of onsite decontamination is the removal of accumulated sludges from separators and systems handling produced water. Offsite decontamination is carried out when onsite decontamination cannot be performed effectively and radiologically safe, when components will have to be refurbished by specialised companies prior to their reuse, and when components not to be reused for their original function has to be cleaned.

Selected {{ground water}} {{microbial}} processes were monitored in wells upslope and downslope from a research chemical waste disposal {{site on the}} campus of the University <b>of</b> Georgia. <b>Burial</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> at the site was discontinued by the middle of the 1970 's. Recently, it was determined that ground water at the site contained elevated levels of potentially toxic pollutants such as iron, manganese, benzene, methylene chloride, toluene, and xylene. Indices of microbial activity (e. g., uptake and mineralization of D-glucose) showed activity to be inhibited 2 to 5 fold in contaminated ground water relative to upslope control. Population switching experiments revealed no enhanced tolerance to the pollutant mixture of bacteria in the contaminated wells relative to control populations. However, rates of degradation of toluene, a compound of the pollutant mixture, were > 20 fold higher in contaminated ground water than in control ground water, suggesting adaptation for enhanced degradation for a specific pollutant. Kinetics of toluene degradation by the microbial populations in the contaminated wells were multiphasic with the kinetic parameters K and V[max] varying widely with substrate concentration. Such kinetic diversity has not been demonstrated previously for pollutant degradation in subsurface waters and has significant implications for modeling pollutant persistence and exposure.

40|$|The Nuclear Waste Repository Technology Department at Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) is {{investigating}} the suitability of Yucca Mountain as a potential site for underground <b>burial</b> <b>of</b> nuclear <b>wastes.</b> One element <b>of</b> the investigations is to assess the potential long-term effects of groundwater flow on the integrity of a potential repository. A number of computer codes {{are being used to}} model groundwater flow through geologic media in which the potential repository would be located. These codes compute numerical solutions for problems that are usually analytically intractable. Consequently, independent confirmation of the correctness of the solution is often not possible. Code verification is a process that permits the determination of the numerical accuracy of codes by comparing the results of several numerical solutions for the same problem. The international nuclear waste research community uses benchmarking for intercomparisons that partially satisfy the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) definition of code verification. This report presents the results from the COVE- 2 A (Code Verification) project, which is a subset of the COVE project...|$|R
