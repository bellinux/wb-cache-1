500|$|For the {{remainder}} of his speech, Colbert joked about other people in the audience, including Peter Pace, Antonin Scalia, John McCain, and Joe Wilson. During this section, he made another reference to global warming while talking about interviewing Jesse Jackson: [...] "You can ask him anything, but he's going to say what he wants, at the pace that he wants. It's like boxing a glacier. Enjoy that metaphor, by the way, <b>because</b> <b>your</b> grandchildren will have no idea what a glacier is." ...|$|E
500|$|Smalley stated {{his belief}} that most {{reactions}} using mechanosynthesis would simply give the wrong product, and that very few reactions and target molecules would likely be compatible with such an approach. He asserted that any robotic assembler arm would need an enzyme-like tool at its end such would require a liquid medium, and as all known enzymes use water as that medium, the range of products must {{be limited to the}} [...] "meat and bone of biology." [...] He accused Drexler of creating [...] "a pretend world where atoms go where you want <b>because</b> <b>your</b> computer program directs them to go there." ...|$|E

500|$|In October 1938, Cotillo lobbied Mussolini [...] "for {{more lenient}} {{consideration}} of the Jewish problem in Italy." [...] In a letter to Il Duce he tried persuade the Italian dictator that Fascist Italy's recent anti-Semitic legislation was unwise, and [...] asked to [...] "postpone execution of such drastic action for a reasonable time until an opportunity has been afforded me to appear before you and present the worthy cause <b>because</b> <b>your</b> edict may result in serious consequences in America." [...] He asked for {{the repeal of the}} anti-Jewish laws and warned for a boycott of Italian goods in New York, where, as he wrote, [...] "we live in close interdependent relationship" [...] with Jewish people.|$|E
500|$|Actress Georgia Taylor {{was cast}} as Toyah {{and the role}} marked her acting debut. Taylor was {{studying}} for her A-levels when she originally auditioned for the part of Zoe Tattersall. She was unsuccessful, so she then auditioned for Toyah and won the role. Of her casting, she explained [...] "When I got the call to say that I'd got the part I just sat there open-mouthed, hugging my best friend. I could barely believe it. It is all very different than being on stage – it's not quite so intense <b>because</b> <b>your</b> audience isn't {{right there in front}} of you. But it's a very different type of satisfaction, working much faster with storylines and characters developing all the time." [...] At the time of her casting, Taylor was two years older than the character she portrayed.|$|E
500|$|Lee and Ermann {{noted that}} NHTSA used a worst case test {{to justify the}} recall of the Pinto, rather than the regular 1977 rear impact crash test. A large [...] "bullet car" [...] was used instead of a {{standard}} moving barrier. Weights {{were placed in the}} nose of the car to help it slide under the Pinto and maximize gas tank contact. The vehicle headlights were turned on to provide a possible ignition source. The fuel tank was completely filled with gasoline rather than partially filled with non-flammable Stoddard fluid as was the normal test procedure. In a later interview the NHTSA engineer was asked why the NHTSA forced a Pinto recall for failing a 35mph test given that most small cars of the time would not have passed.

500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} {{at the start}} of the season when head coach Ralph Friedgen selected senior Jordan Steffy as the starting quarterback over junior Chris Turner. In 2007, when Steffy suffered a concussion against 10th-ranked Rutgers, the relatively untested Turner took over and led Maryland to an upset victory. He then started the remainder of the season, compiled a 4–5 record in games he started, and led another upset against eighth-ranked Boston College. In comparing the practice performances of Steffy, Turner, and third-stringer Josh Portis, offensive coordinator James Franklin said:It gets hard if one quarterback all through spring and all through summer camp was statistically better in almost every single category, it's hard to rationalize not making him the starter ... <b>because</b> <b>your</b> gut feeling is one thing and the statistics are another. Jordan led by a pretty large amount in completion percentage ... the least interception percentage. He didn't lead in yards per ... percentage of explosive plays. I consider an explosive play a play of 16yards or more ... Portis led in that and Turner was second and Jordan was third.|$|E
500|$|Several bonus tracks follow on {{separate}} editions; some continue the teenage theme, {{while others are}} joke tracks. Barker used Afro-Cuban influences for his drum track on [...] "Don't Tell Me It's Over", and DeLonge used something other than his punk influences for [...] "What Went Wrong". [...] While DeLonge felt [...] "staple acoustic songs" [...] were big for groups at the time (such as Green Day's [...] "Good Riddance"), the band wrote all of their songs from their inception on acoustic guitars, and he felt he would rather have [...] "What Went Wrong" [...] in its original form. [...] "You grow up and realize, 'Fuck! Who gives a fuck about punk rock?'" [...] he said. [...] "There are so many great forms of music out there, and you grow beyond wanting to listen to or write something <b>because</b> <b>your</b> parents will hate it." [...] Finn suggested lyrics for the song after viewing a documentary on the first Russian nuclear test; in the film, an aged Soviet physicist says of watching the explosion, [...] "There was a loud boom, and then the bomb began fiercely kicking at the world." ...|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and I can see why Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person <b>because</b> <b>your</b> brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E

He is just your slave and the Greeks will have but a poor triumph. As for yourself, you will be going home with the object for your campaign accomplished, for you have burnt Athens".|$|E
2500|$|... "If it is a wall": if Israel had ascended like a wall from Babylon, the Temple {{would not}} have been {{destroyed}} during that period for a second time. Rabbi Zeira went to the marketplace to buy something. He said to the one who was weighing: that was weighed very fairly. He responded: Do not depart from here, Babylonian, <b>because</b> <b>your</b> ancestors destroyed the Temple. At that moment Rabbi Zeira said, are not my ancestors the same as the ancestors of this one?! Rabbi Zeira entered the house of study and heard the voice of Rabbi Sheila who was sitting and teaching: [...] "'If it is a wall': if Israel had ascended like a wall from the Exile, the Temple {{would not have}} been destroyed a second time." [...] He said: the unlearned person taught me well.|$|E
2500|$|A proper stance {{starts with}} your feet being aligned at the target, {{followed}} by your knees, hips and shoulders. Your feet should be shoulder width apart, your front foot should be slightly opened towards the target and your back foot should be perpendicular to the target. [...] As you increase in club, your stance should widen for further stability. [...] Your shoulders will be naturally open to the target line <b>because</b> <b>your</b> arms are not at equal length while holding the club. [...] Make sure to close your shoulders slightly to stay aligned with the target line. [...] The proper stance affects how controlled the backswing is, governs the amount of hip turn in the backswing, and allows for the hips to clear through the downswing. [...] Your front arm should be extended at all times to allow the club to travel in its maximum arc.|$|E
