5|$|<b>Back,</b> <b>leg,</b> {{and neck}} {{injuries}} {{began to take}} a toll on Van Buren in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke his toe in the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team's four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title {{for the first time}} in four years and had career-lows in touchdowns and yards per carry. The Eagles finished with a 6–6 regular season record. Greasy Neale was fired by the Eagles the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, Van Buren played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom the Eagles selected in that year's draft out of LSU. The elder Van Buren continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as the Eagles finished with a losing record for the first time since 1942.|$|E
25|$|Belcher {{returned}} home between 6:30 A.M. and 7:00 A.M., and argued with Perkins again. Belcher shot and murdered Perkins {{right in front}} of his mother, Cheryl Shepherd. Police arrived at the house at around 7:50 A.M., following a call from Shepherd, who had recently moved there from West Babylon, New York, to help the couple care for Zoey. The baby was heard crying in the background when Belcher's mother called. Perkins, who was 22 years of age, {{had been shot in the}} neck, chest, abdomen, hip, <b>back,</b> <b>leg,</b> and hand, a total of 9 times.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no single}} universally {{accepted}} stance, with a wide variation between players who compete at professional cuesports. However, {{there are a number}} of common characteristics: generally the <b>back</b> <b>leg</b> is braced while the front leg is slightly bent with the player leaning into the shot; the player's weight is evenly distributed, and the body remains still for the duration of the shot. Many of the modern players face the line of the shot, while a more traditional stance would see the player twist their body so their back foot is at a right-angle to the shot.|$|E

25|$|Cinderpaw {{falls from}} the Sky Oak, {{breaking}} her <b>back</b> <b>leg.</b> As Leafpool's determination to heal her begins to border on an obsession, Jaypaw begins to wonder why. One night, he falls asleep by Cinderpaw and wakes up in a strange forest. There he meets Cinderpaw, unhurt, who leads him to a camp filled with familiar smells; ThunderClan's previous home in the forest. Cinderpaw describes how she once lived there before the Great Journey and asks Jaypaw to tell Leafpool that she is proud of her, and that she has learned far more than she could have ever taught her. By then Jaypaw is confused, but upon looking into Cinderpaw's eyes, he sees a series of flashbacks from her previous life. Jaypaw realizes that when Cinderpelt, the former ThunderClan medicine cat, died in Twilight she was reincarnated as Cinderpaw, without Cinderpaw herself knowing it. However, when Cinderpaw wakes she does not remember the dream, only that Jaypaw {{had been able to}} see in it.|$|E
25|$|The pipe {{band of the}} 51st Highland Brigade played {{outside the}} stadium for the hour before he ran. The 400 metres had been {{considered}} a middle-distance event in which runners raced round the first bend and coasted through the <b>back</b> <b>leg.</b> Inspired by the Biblical message, and deprived of {{a view of the}} other runners because he drew the outside lane, Liddell raced the whole of the first 200 metres to be well clear of the favoured Americans. With little option but to then treat the race as a complete sprint, he continued to race round the final bend. He was challenged {{all the way down the}} home straight but held on to take the win. He broke the Olympic and world records with a time of 47.6 seconds. It was controversially ratified as a world record, despite it being 0.2 seconds slower than the record for the greater distance of 440 yards.|$|E
25|$|On September 16, 1979, Hinton {{was racing}} the RB-51 in the Reno Air Races when a {{capacitor}} in the magneto failed, causing {{the engine to}} run on half its spark plugs. Not knowing what was wrong, Hinton pushed the plane to full throttle. This resulted in the supercharger carrying the extra pressure. Eventually, a bearing in the supercharger failed. Hinton finished the race in second place and moved to make an emergency landing. The supercharger failure resulted in a shaft failure, however; that shaft drove the oil pump, which in turn controlled the propeller pitch. The propellers went flat, acting as a huge air brake. The RB-51 crashed short of the runway. The wings were sheared off as the plane came down between two piles of rock and the fuel erupted in a fireball. The cockpit was thrown end-over-end away from the fire, yet Hinton survived with a broken <b>back,</b> <b>leg,</b> and ankle. His survival is attributed {{by one of the}} lead engineers, Pete Law, to additional braces and a roll bar installed on the cockpit.|$|E

25|$|The statue {{measures}} 74 centimetres (29inches) in height; {{the pedestal}} is 27 centimetres (10.6inches) in width. The {{core of the}} sculpture was carved from {{a single piece of}} wood, most likely from a poplar tree, though earlier art historians have assumed it to be pear, plum or lime. The sculpture’s surface is entirely covered with sheets of gold leaf less than 0.25 millimetres (0.01in) thick, which are held in place by minute golden bolts. The size of the individual gold leaves varies to suit the surface texture. The faces of both mother and child are pounded out of one single leaf each. The coloured eyes of the figures are made of cloisonné enamel. While the eyes of the mother are inset into carved fittings, those of the child are merely pasted on the wooden core. The child’s hand is made of cast silver and was added only in the 14th century; the original right hand is lost. There are traces of original tenth century adornments on the orb in the Virgin's right hand, on the right <b>back</b> <b>leg</b> of the stool, {{as well as on the}} child's book and halo. The agrafe showing an eagle and seemingly pinning Mary’s cloak is an early thirteenth century addition; the fibula beneath has Gothic features and is dated to the fourteenth century.|$|E

500|$|On December 4, 1971, Zappa {{suffered}} {{his first}} of two serious setbacks. While performing at Casino de Montreux in Switzerland, the Mothers' equipment was destroyed when a flare set off by an audience member started a fire that burned down the casino. Immortalized in Deep Purple's song [...] "Smoke on the Water", the event and immediate aftermath can be heard on the bootleg album Swiss Cheese/Fire, released legally as part of Zappa's Beat the Boots II compilation. After losing $50,000 worth of equipment and a week's break, the Mothers played at the Rainbow Theatre, London, with rented gear. During the encore, audience member Trevor Howell pushed Zappa off the stage and into the concrete-floored orchestra pit. The band thought Zappa had been killed—he had suffered serious fractures, head trauma and injuries to his <b>back,</b> <b>leg,</b> and neck, {{as well as a}} crushed larynx, which ultimately caused his voice to drop a third after healing.|$|E
