Recovery of lithium has been demonstrated in the field; the lithium is separated <b>by</b> <b>simple</b> filtration. The process and environmental costs are primarily those of the already-operating well; net environmental impacts may thus be positive.|$|E
5|$|Metagenomic {{analysis}} pipelines use {{two approaches}} in the annotation of coding {{regions in the}} assembled contigs.

New information allows theories and models to be modified to provide more reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E

5|$|Paterson's worms are {{a family}} of {{cellular}} automata devised in 1971 by Mike Paterson and John Horton Conway to model the behaviour and feeding patterns of certain prehistoric worms. In the model, a worm moves between points on a triangular grid along line segments, representing food. Its turnings {{are determined by the}} configuration of eaten and uneaten line segments adjacent to {{the point at which the}} worm currently is. Despite being governed <b>by</b> <b>simple</b> rules the behaviour of the worms can be extremely complex, and the ultimate fate of one variant is still unknown.|$|E
5|$|Smetana's {{visit to}} Liszt at Weimar {{in the summer}} of 1857, where he heard the latter's Faust Symphony and Die Ideale, caused a {{material}} reorientation of Smetana's orchestral music. These works gave Smetana answers to many compositional problems relating to the structure of orchestral music, and suggested a means for expressing literary subjects by a synthesis between music and text, rather than <b>by</b> <b>simple</b> musical illustration. These insights enabled Smetana to write the three Gothenburg symphonic poems, (RichardIII, Wallenstein's Camp and Hakon Jarl), works that transformed Smetana from a composer primarily of salon pieces to a modern neo-Romantic, capable of handling large-scale forces and demonstrating the latest musical concepts.|$|E

5|$|The lack of circulatory and {{respiratory}} organs limits platyhelminths to {{sizes and shapes}} that enable oxygen to reach and carbon dioxide to leave {{all parts of the}}ir bodies <b>by</b> <b>simple</b> diffusion. Hence, many are microscopic and the large species have flat ribbon-like or leaf-like shapes. The guts of large species have many branches, allowing nutrients to diffuse to all parts of the body. Respiration through the whole surface of the body makes them vulnerable to fluid loss, and restricts them to environments where dehydration is unlikely: sea and freshwater, moist terrestrial environments such as leaf litter or between grains of soil, and as parasites within other animals.|$|E
5|$|The lungs {{of birds}} contain {{millions}} of tiny parallel passages called parabronchi. Small sacs called atria radiate {{from the walls}} of the tiny passages; these, like the alveoli in other lungs, are the site of gas exchange <b>by</b> <b>simple</b> diffusion. The blood flow around the parabronchi and their atria forms a cross-current process of gas exchange (see diagram on the right).|$|E
5|$|Another classic bit {{of cinema}} {{that is largely}} a myth is the {{showdown}} at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, {{as in the case}} of the Luke Short – Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won <b>by</b> <b>simple</b> distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation.|$|E

The 105 members of the Senate, whose seats are apportioned on a regional basis, serve until age 75. Five parties had representatives elected to the federal parliament in the 2015 election: the Liberal Party of Canada who currently form the government, the Conservative Party of Canada who are the Official Opposition, the New Democratic Party, the Bloc Québécois, and the Green Party of Canada.|$|E
5|$|Hope, Powell, and Monk were {{considered}} by their contemporaries to be influences {{on each other}} early in their careers, and all, therefore, helped affect the development of jazz piano. Powell was known for horn-like right-hand playing supported <b>by</b> <b>simple</b> left-hand chords, which was something he had worked on with Hope. Later pianists who have cited Hope as a major influence include Lafayette Gilchrist, Alexander Hawkins, Frank Hewitt, and Hasaan Ibn Ali. Hawkins said in 2013 that Hope was important {{because he had a}} highly individual style but does not have the iconic status of pianists such as Monk. Modern jazz guitarist Kurt Rosenwinkel has mentioned Hope's rhythms, phrasing, and compositions as influences.|$|E
5|$|Housing in Scotland {{includes}} {{all forms of}} built habitation {{in what is now}} Scotland, from the earliest period of human occupation to the present day. The oldest house in Scotland dates from the Mesolithic era. In the Neolithic era settled farming led to the construction of the first stone houses. There is also evidence from this period of large timber halls. In the Bronze Age there were cellular round houses, crannogs (built on artificial islands) and hillforts that enclosed large settlements. In the Iron Age cellular houses begin to be replaced on the northern isles <b>by</b> <b>simple</b> Atlantic roundhouses, substantial circular buildings with a drystone construction.

5|$|In June 1844, the Senate, {{with its}} Whig majority, soundly {{rejected}} the Tyler–Texas treaty. The pro-annexation Democrat Polk narrowly defeated anti-annexation Whig Henry Clay in the 1844 presidential election.

The Democratic-dominated House of Representatives complied with his request by passing an amended bill expanding on the pro-slavery {{provisions of the}} Tyler treaty. The Senate narrowly passed a compromise version of the House bill (by the vote of the minority Democrats and several southern Whigs), designed to provide the incoming President-elect Polk the options of immediate annexation of Texas or new talks to revise the annexation terms of the House-amended bill.|$|E
