50|$|Collapse {{action is}} a device {{behaviour}} that snaps a switch into place, usually using a <b>bistable</b> <b>element.</b> When flipping a light switch, strain on one spring increases until it flips position, pulling down the switch. Collapse action allows one to remove their hand from the switch without risk of it falling to the down position, as the force needed to overcome the resistance is too great. The action also does not exert force in the lower position, avoiding a spontaneous rise to the up position.|$|E

New digital designs often include scan chains; high quality economical test is the reason. A scan chain allows easy access to internal combinational logic by converting <b>bistable</b> <b>elements,</b> latches and flip-flops, into a shift register. Test patterns are scanned in, applied to the internal circuitry, and the results are scanned out for comparison.

It is demonstrated that the symmetry of the structure’s bistable behaviour has important implications for the selection of driving actuators.

40|$|It is {{generally}} believed that associative memory {{in the brain}} depends on multistable synaptic dynamics, which enable the synapses to maintain their value for extended periods of time. However, multistable dynamics are not restricted to synapses. In particular, the dynamics of some genetic regulatory networks are multistable, raising the possibility that even single cells, {{in the absence of}} a nervous system, are capable of learning associations. Here we study a standard genetic regulatory network model with <b>bistable</b> <b>elements</b> and stochastic dynamics. We demonstrate that such a genetic regulatory network model is capable of learning multiple, general, overlapping associations. The capacity of the network, defined as the number of associations that can be simultaneously stored and retrieved, is proportional to the square root of the number of <b>bistable</b> <b>elements</b> in the genetic regulatory network. Moreover, we compute the capacity of a clonal population of cells, such as in a colony of bacteria or a tissue, to store associations. We show that even if the cells do not interact, the capacity of the population to store associations substantially exceeds that of a single cell and is proportional to the number of <b>bistable</b> <b>elements.</b> Thus, we show that even single cells are endowed with the computational power to learn associations, a power that is substantially enhanced when these cells form a population...|$|R
40|$|With a view {{to reduce}} the number of {{components}} in a Static Random Access Memory (SRAM) cell, the feasibility of use of Lambda Bipolar Transistor (LBT) in the <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> of the cell has been explored under the present study. The LBT under consideration here comprises of an enhancement mode MOSFET integrated with a parasitic bipolar transistor so as to perform as a negative resistance device. LBTs for the study have been fabricated and analysed. The devices have been shown to function at much lower voltage and current levels than those reported earlier/ and thus have been shown to be suitable for lower power applications. The issues of agreements and discrepancies of the experimental results with the original DC model of the device have been highlighted and discussed. The factors contributing to the drain current of the MOSFET in the LBT have been identified. It has also been shown that in the real case of an LBT in operation, the MOSFET in it does not function as a discrete device for the same conditions of voltages and current levels as in an LBT. As per the present study, it is assessed to be influenced by the presence of the BJT in operation and this effect is felt more at the lower current levels of operation. With a separate and tailored p-well implantation the possibility of fabrication of LBTs with a CMOS technology is established. Along with a couple of polysilicon resistors, the LBTs have been successfully made to perform in the common-collector configuration as the bistable storage element of SRAM cell (as proposed in the literature). The <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> with the LBT in common-emitter mode also has been visualised and practically achieved with the fabricated devices. The WRITE transients for either case have been simulated for various levels of WRITE voltages and their time of hold. The speed of Writing achieved are found comparable with that of the standard SRAMs. The advantages and disadvantages of using the LBT in either mode have been highlighted and discussed. The power consumption of the <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> with the LBT in either mode is however shown to be the same. A different approach of READING has been proposed to overcome the factors known to increase the cycle time. On the whole, under the present study, the proposal of using LBTs in the bistable storage element of the SRAM cell has been shown to be feasible. Such SRAM circuits can find possible applications in the fields where smaller circuit area is the major concern...|$|E

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{scaling of}} CMOS technologies {{results in a}} strong increase of leakage currents in digital circuits. Reduction of static power dissipation is therefore an important issue, particularly in low-power system-on-a-chip (SoC) for mobile application where it has a large impact on the battery life. Static power dissipation in embedded memories is particularly crucial since those occupy a large area in VLSI circuits. Moreover, since the memories have to guarantee data storage, their power supply cannot be cut during long standby periods, unlike the other logic circuits. The present work aims at developing new circuits architectures to strongly reduce leakage currents in CMOS circuits, especially in storage elements. The proposed circuits rely on an original diode architecture made of two complementary MOSFETs, i. e. the Ultra-Low Power (ULP) diode. Negative gate-to-source voltage bias of the transistors in reverse mode results in ultra-low diode reverse current. This property makes the ULP diode particularly suited {{for the design of}} voltage multipliers (Dickson charge pumps) with high voltage multiplication factors, low power dissipation and high temperature functionality. As second interesting property, the ULP diode has a negative impedance characteristic in reverse mode. Based on this, a <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> (ULP latch) is obtained by connecting two reverse biased ULP diodes in series. This <b>bistable</b> <b>element</b> can be used in any circuit requiring storage functionality, with a reduction of subthreshold leakage by orders of magnitude when compared with a conventional CMOS latch made of inverters. In this thesis, we model the ULP latch behavior for deep sub-micron technologies and investigate its properties. Our analysis relies on experimental characterization on various SOI CMOS technologies, up to 250 °C. The feasibility of ultra-low leakage memory circuits based on the ULP latch is demonstrated experimentally by the design of SRAM circuits on a 0. 13 µm Partially-Depleted SOI CMOS process.

The material of the thermal switching element generates heat in response to electrical current flow therethrough, which in turn causes the material to undergo a thermal phase transition from a high electrical resistance state to a low electrical resistance state as the temperature increases above a predetermined value. Application of the electrical potential in one direction renders the thermal switching element conductive to pass electron current out of the ion source. This causes positive ions to flow from the source into the <b>bistable</b> switching <b>element</b> and intercalate the same to produce a non-volatile, low resistance logic state.

The network equations constitute a fast-slow system; we show that there are four curves of saddle-node points of the fast system whose geometry in parameter space encodes information about the wave form and frequency. These curves give information about the value of the variables at which transitions are made between high and low voltage states for either of the elements, and how those transition points in phase space depend on the coupling strength. Furthermore, we develop a new geometric method to construct the curves of saddle-nodes from families of curves associated with the equations for each of the two cells. The construction allows one to see how changes in either of the elements affects the wave form of the network output. The analysis also shows that the network can produce unintuitive behavior. For example, though electric coupling may keep the network pinned longer at a higher or lower voltage level than the uncoupled oscillator, larger values of the coupling strength may be less effective at this pinning. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.
