40|$|Two-dimensional flow is {{considered}} in a fluid bead {{located in the}} gap between a pair of contra-rotating cylinders and bounded by two curved menisci. The stability of such bead flows with two inlet films, and hence no contact line, are analysed as the roll speed ratio S is increased. One of the inlet films {{can be regarded as}} an ‘input flux’ whilst the other is a ‘returning film’ whose thickness is specified as a fraction [zeta] of the outlet film on that roll. The flow is modelled via lubrication theory and for Ca [double less-than sign] 1, where Ca represents the capillary number, boundary conditions are formally developed that account for S [not equal] 1 and the non-constant gap. It is shown that there is a qualitative difference in the results between the single and double inlet film models unless small correction terms to the pressure drops at the interfaces are taken into account. Futhermore, it is shown that the inclusion of these small terms produces an O(1) effect on the prediction of the critical value of S at which <b>bead</b> <b>break</b> occurs. When the limits of the returning film fraction are examined it is found that as [zeta] [rightward arrow] 0 results are in good agreement with those for the single inlet film. Further it is shown for a fixed input flux that as [zeta] [rightward arrow] 1 a transition from <b>bead</b> <b>break</b> to upstream flooding of the nip can occur and multiple two-dimensionally stable solutions exist. For a varying input flux and fixed and ‘sufficiently large’ values of [zeta] there is a critical input flux &[lambda]macr;([zeta]) such that as S is increased from zero: (i) <b>bead</b> <b>break</b> occurs for [lambda] &[lambda]macr;; (iii) when [lambda] = &[lambda]macr; the flow becomes neutrally stable at a specific value of S beyond which there exist two steady solutions (two-dimensionally stable) leading to <b>bead</b> <b>break</b> and upstream flooding, respectively...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with developing suitable models for the investigation of instabilities in rigid and deformable roll coating flows. Consideration is restricted to Newtonian, incompressible fluids {{in the absence of}} inertia. In each coating flow analysed the steady two dimensional base state solutions of the system axe explored before the stability of the system is considered. The particular rigid roll coating flow that is studied in this thesis is the flow formed between an intermediate pair of contra-rotating rolls within a multiple roll coater. The base state is modelled using lubrication theory and the flow domain is terminated with simple boundary conditions. It is found that the form of the meniscus location solutions differ from those found in similax flows by previous workers and this motivates a detailed re-examination of the boundaxy conditions. A matched asymptotic analysis applicable for small capillaxy numbers Ca and small inter-roll gaps gives the leading order correction to the boundary conditions and it is found that the inclusion of the correction terms alter the results significantly. It is found that a critical roll speed ratio, Sc exists beyond which no steady two dimensional solutions exist. A simple stability hypothesis predicts the upstream meniscus to be neutrally stable at Sc and this point is associated with <b>bead</b> <b>break.</b> Under certain operating conditions the stability hypothesis predicts multiple steady states. The lineax stability of this multiple roll coating flow is investigated. Special attention is given to the relationship between the wavelength of the disturbance and the form of the boundary conditions. The main predictions of the stability hypothesis axe confirmed and an additional ribbing instability on the downstream meniscus is predicted. The base flow of a deformable roll coater is investigated using lubrication theory for the fluid and a linear elastic plain strain model for the compliant layer. The boundary conditions developed for the multiple roll problem are extended to higher values of Ca. A finite element method is developed to numerically solve the governing equations. The effects of Youngs modulus E and layer thickness L on the steady state operation of the coater are investigated. Previous workers have used spring models to describe the compliant layer with the implicit assumption that E and L- 1 have the same affect. Here it is shown that E and L- 1 have a different effect upon the meniscus location in the negative gap regime and hence the underlying assumption of all spring models is shown to be incorrect. The plain strain model is extended to include viscoelastic terms and it is shown that these terms can account for the discrepancy between experimental results and previous steady state elastic theories. The lineax stability of the deformable roll coater is investigated with the plain strain model being extended to account for lateral disturbances. The effect of E and L- 1 on the stability of the system is investigated and it is found that in keeping with the steady state results, they have a different effect on the stability of the system in the negative gap regime. It is demonstrated that perturbations to the compliant layer play a negligible role in the stability analysis and it is shown how the viscoelastic extension to the base state can be incorporated...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} primarily with the investigation, both analytically and numerically, of instabilities in reverse- and forward-roll and slot coating flows. Consideration {{is restricted to}} Newtonian, incompressible fluids {{in the absence of}} inertial forces. The onset of the ribbing instability in inlet flooded, reverse roll coating is examined first by applying linear stability theory to a base flow formulated using lubrication theory. Regions of instability are established and found to be in accord with experimental observation. These results are then compared with predictions from a stability hypothesis based on a two-dimensional force balance argument. This simple criterion shows that the effect of various parameters on the stability of the downstream free surface can be ascertained by examining their influence on the pressure gradient and meniscus location. The stability hypothesis is shown to underpredict the critical capillary number and so is only sufficient for predicting stability. Results are also compared to ones obtained numerically by applying linear stability theory to finite element solutions for the entire flow field, the principal difference being that the analytical approach overpredicts the critical capillary number for the onset of instability. A variation of inlet flooded, reverse roll coating is then studied in which the nip is fed from above by a large reservoir of fluid (i. e. a hydrostatic head). The influence of this head on the base flow (obtained using lubrication theory) and its stability is then investigated. An improved model of the dynamic contact line, developed by Shikhmurzaev [1993 a] is described in which the dynamic contact angle is no longer kept constant, but is a function of various fluid and geometrical parameters. The limit of this theory for small capillary number is incorporated into the analytical model from which its effect on the base flow and stability is examined. Instabilities in forward roll coating are then investigated. The inlet flooded case is studied using linear stability analysis, a stability hypothesis and the finite element method. As in reverse roll coating, the stability hypothesis at the downstream free surface is sufficient for predicting stability only. The finite element method, on the other hand, leads to solutions that are in close agreement with linear stability theory, unlike the reverse roll case. Inlet starved forward roll coating is examined next and, as with the inlet flooded case, the ribbing instability can still manifest at the downstream free surface. The presence of an instability known as <b>bead</b> <b>break,</b> noted experimentally by Malone [1992] and Gaskell et al [1998], is verified analytically using linear stability theory. It is then shown that a stability hypothesis applied at the upstream free surface gives an accurate description of stability (unlike at the downstream free surface). Finally, the slot coating geometry is explored. A geometrically flexible finite element code is described for which it is possible to use various lip shapes and a roll of variable radius and location (with respect to the slot). Initially, as has always been the case in previous work reported in the literature, the numerical mesh incorporates a downstream wetting line pinned at the lip edge and the effect of the various fluid and geometrical parameters on the resultant pressure profile and upstream meniscus location is examined. These numerical results are seen to compare favourably with predictions obtained analytically using a model based on lubrication theory. However, Sartor [1990] showed that the downstream wetting line does not always remain pinned, but can climb up the die shoulder or regress into the coating gap. This has been confirmed experimentally by Kapur [1998] who also notes that ribs only appear when operating in the unpinned regime. Hence, the case in which the downstream, static contact line has retreated from the lip edge towards the inlet is studied. Pressure profiles and meniscus locations are compared with those for the case of a pinned downstream wetting line and the numerical linear stability analysis used to determine the effect of the fluid and geometrical parameters on the stability of the downstream free surface...|$|E

Polydispersity of real <b>beads</b> <b>breaks</b> some contacts, creating a disordered lattice of contacting beads. At large stress, the sound velocity behaves according to Hertz contact law and departs from it at lower stress. This evolution is reversible, {{with the same}} crossover when increasing or decreasing the stress, for a given piling. Correlations are much more sensitive to disorder. When calculated with signals propagated in the same lattice, they evolve reversibly with the stress, being much higher at large stress when the contact lattice is more regular.

40|$|International audienceWe {{report on}} discrete-element method (DEM) {{simulations}} of the breakage of fragile particles under growing oedometric load, motivated by applications to clinker grinding {{processes in the}} cement industry. The use of a simplified model, in which spherical <b>beads</b> <b>break</b> into smaller spherical fragments with some loss of volume, enables us to perform a systematic parametric study and to investigate collective effects, as the transfer of load to other particles following one breakage event may entail large scale avalanches or cascades involving the rupture of many grains. Particles are attributed random strengths, chosen according to Weibull distributions of varying width, and rupture criteria are defined either in terms of contact forces or of average stresses within the grain. A dimensionless parameter, ?S, is defined, which combines the influence of particle strength and contact stiffness. ?S expresses the characteristic contact deflection, relative to the particle diameter, at rupture. Model materials range from stiff-fragile (large ?S) to soft-strong (small ?S). Initial packings also differ in solid fraction F 0. The energy efficiency, defined as the ratio to dissipated energy of elastic energy in each grain before its breakage, is strongly correlated {{to the importance of}} the cascading effect, either through the quantity of kinetic energy released in the system, or through the capacity to capture it back in the form of elastic energy without dissipation. It ranges from 1 % to 15 % in the simulation, an order of magnitude compatible with the efficiency claimed in the industrial processes. Energy efficiency is mainly determined, by order of decreasing importance, by ?S, F 0, distribution width and choice of rupture criterion. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Baltic amber-bead {{necklaces}} or bracelets {{are commonly}} used for managing teething symptoms in infants. The effectiveness of these beads is claimed to be from succinic acid release (a compound with analgesic and anti-inflammatory properties), which is then absorbed through the skin. AIM: To investigate whether Baltic amber teething necklaces purchased in Australia contained succinic acid, and to quantify succinic acid release from the beads. METHODS: Infrared spectroscopy was used {{to confirm that the}} teething necklaces were made of Baltic amber. The amount of succinic acid contained within the beads was quantified, and succinic acid release from intact beads was measured in phosphate buffered saline (PBS) pH 5. 5 or octanol to simulate aqueous or oily skin environments. RESULTS: Each necklace (33 beads in length) contained 19. 17 ± 4. 89 mg of succinic acid (mean±se). Over a 6 -month period, no succinic acid was detected in PBS, while 0. 13 ± 0. 09 mg of succinic acid per necklace was released in octanol. Only one replicate of amber beads in octanol released succinic acid, and they had fragmented, with shards free-floating in the solvent. DISCUSSION: It is likely succinic acid was only detected because the <b>beads</b> were <b>breaking</b> down in octanol, which does not occur when worn around the neck of a child. Furthermore, the hydrophilic properties of succinic acid would not favour its absorption across hydrophobic layers of the skin and into the bloodstream.

40|$|We {{study the}} {{equilibrium}} properties {{of a single}} flexible homopolymers where consecutive monomers are represented by impenetrable hard spherical beads tangential to each other, and non-consecutive monomers interact via a square-well potential. To this aim, we use both replica exchange canonical simulations and micro-canonical Wang-Landau techniques. We perform a close comparative analysis of the corresponding results, and find perfect agreement between the two methods {{as well as the}} past results. The model is then refined in two different directions. By allowing partial overlapping between consecutive <b>beads,</b> we <b>break</b> the spherical symmetry and thus provide a severe constraint on the possible conformations of the chain. This leads to a single helix or a double helix ground state, depending on the range of the interactions. Alternatively, we introduce additional spherical beads at specific positions to represent the steric hindrance of the side chains in real proteins. The ground state in this case is found to be again a globule, thus showing that contrary to some recent suggestions, side chains alone are not sufficient to insure a protein-like structure. Finally, we show that a combination of the above two effects increases the stability of the obtaining secondary structures, in agreement with previous results.

30|$|Template DNA {{molecules}} can {{be generated}} either by fragmentation or standard PCR. If fragmentation is used, universal adaptors are ligated to the fragment end, similar to the method used by Illumina. In the case of PCR, the adaptors can be built into the primers. The prepared fragments are hybridised to special beads upon which both amplification and sequencing takes place; the beads are used in excess to ensure that each bead binds a maximum of one template molecule. A mix of these beads, PCR reagents and oil is then agitated to form an emulsion of tiny oil reaction chambers, each containing a single bead with a single molecule attached and all the components of a PCR. This is subjected to thermal cycling to clonally amplify the DNA template {{on the surface of}} each bead (known as emulsion PCR or emPCR). The sequencing reaction is performed on a specially fabricated ‘PicoTitre Plate (PTP)’—this comprises millions of microscopic wells, each just big enough to contain a single template <b>bead.</b> After <b>breaking</b> the emulsion the beads are loaded onto the PTP along with other, much smaller beads that contain all the reagents necessary for the sequencing reaction except the nucleotides. Sequencing proceeds with the sequential addition of each individual nucleotide in turn (i.e. A, then C, then G, then T). If a nucleotide is incorporated by DNA polymerase into the growing DNA strand, an inorganic phosphate ion is released. This initiates an enzyme cascade resulting in the release of a flash of light. Since no terminators are used in this chemistry, incorporation of nucleotides into homopolymer stretches continues until a different base is encountered and the associated light flash is proportionally brighter. The location and intensity of light emitted is detected by a camera across the whole plate. Excess nucleotides are then washed off in preparation for the next cycle. This process is repeated several hundred times to build the temporal image sequence. Unlike other chemistries the number of incorporation cycles required to reach a particular read length is dependent on the sequence composition of the template. On average read length is expected to be ~ 2.5 × cycle number but this could be less with more homopolymers. As before the temporal series of images can be computationally converted into sequence reads.|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{acoustic}} emission (AE) {{is used as}} experimental evidence of the progressive nature of grain crushing. Stress controlled high pressure oedometric compression test are carried out on 1. 2 mm monodisperse samples of glass beads. It was observed that the granular assembly starts to experience particle breakage at a vertical stress of about 25 MPa. When this yield pressure is exceeded the glass <b>beads</b> start to <b>break</b> emitting loud impulsive sound and the vertical displacement increases rapidly. The load was increased beyond the yield stress and at each increment while the vertical stress remained constant the sample continued to emit sound. The emission of sound at a constant vertical stress indicates that crushing is a progressive failure mechanism; once the first crushing event occurs, the structure starts to rearrange causing other crushing events to occur and additional settlement. In particular, two signal processing algorithms are used on the samples of the acoustic signal to obtain two additional metrics of the crushing evolution. The first is the cumulative energy versus time. The second {{is the number of}} crushing events versus time, which is based on the automatic detection of the peaks of the sound signal envelope. There is a clear correlation between the cumulative acoustic energy emitted and the observed sample displacement. Using laser scanning, the evolution of the particle size distribution and particle shape are measured in detail so that a link between the acoustic data and the crushing intensity is established. The crushing intensity was controlled using materials with different strengths...|$|R

5000|$|A {{need was}} {{experienced}} by avid 4x4 enthusiasts and overland travelers {{for a simple}} tool to effectively and efficiently remove the tire from the rim of a wheel, in cases where a tire requires repairs to the inside. On ATV's, as well as motorcycles, passenger vehicles, trucks, many industrial and offroad vehicles, as well as light aircraft have an additional feature on the rim called the Bead Retainer. The bead retainer is a bump like feature that prevents the tire bead from slipping inward on the rim and losing the air seal. On ATV's (and UTV's/side-by-sides) this bead retainer is substantially large because these tires are often run at very low air pressures (~5 psi) and experience severe side loading forces from typical trail riding. The large bead retainer is necessary to prevent unintentional dislocation of the tire bead from the bead seat. Further, if a ATV tire does lose pressure from a puncture, the large bead retainer will keep the Tire in place for low speed riding allowing the operator to navigate to the trail head without the tire coming completely off of the rim. The large bead retainers of ATV's do {{such a good job}} keeping the tire in place during operating conditions, it also prevents the tire from being easily changed with normal tools even in a shop setting.There are three categories of tire bead breaker designs: 1) [...] "Shoe and Lever mechanism", 2) [...] "Plier-type mechanism", 3) [...] "Clamp and Ram mechanism". The Shoe and Lever mechanism performs well on many motorcycle tires, passenger vehicle tires and trailers, however with more difficult-to-change tires it often fails {{because of the nature of}} the design. The shoe pushes down on the tire sidewall next to the tire bead, and if the bead is stuck, the shoe will simply slide down the sidewall. [...] Further the Shoe and Lever mechanism is quite large, and is not a good portable solution for on-the-trail tire changes. Advantages are typically low cost, often less than $50, and can be found manufactured by many companies. The Plier-Type tool has a spike that pushes in between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and can actually put a separating force on the bead bundle. However the pivot point results in a arc that quickly transitions to pushing on the sidewall. The Plier-type mechanism is more effective than the Shoe and Lever, however it has some disadvantages. It must be adjusted for different diameter wheels, it makes metal on metal contact with the rim, and can easily scratch and mar the surface of aluminum or painted wheels, it takes a bit of coordination and balance to use as you have to stand on the tire and use your body weight to operate the tool, and it is also fairly large, but ultimately is portable and is often used at race tracks for pit-stop tire changes. Ultimately, this type of bead breaker also struggles to work reliably on very stubborn ATV tires, 4x4 trucks, and tractors. The cost of the Plier-type is variable, form $75 to $200, and is manufactured by multiple companies. Lastly, the Clamp-and-Ram mechanism tool [...] is by far the most effective and compact tool for <b>breaking</b> <b>beads</b> on ATV's and other difficult-to-change tires. The only company who makes a this style of ATV Bead Breaker is BeadBuster. This style of tool has a pointed foot that enters the space between the tire bead and lip of the rim, and it uses a padded clamp that is driven with a wrench to get pulled in all the way with very little user effort. The Ram foot then gets actuated by another bolt, with little effort by the user, and it completely <b>breaks</b> the <b>bead</b> loose in one motion. Because the tool is clamped in place, it cannot slide down the sidewall and damage the tire. The ram foot pushes directly on the steel bead bundle of the tire, and therefore works well on old and deteriorated tires. The Clamp and Ram tool (aka. [...] "BeadBuster") is extremely portable and easily fits in a tool box or glove compartment, and is priced at $99 up to $200 for a professional model.|$|R
