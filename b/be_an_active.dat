The Adour engine found use in several aircraft abroad, such as the McDonnell Douglas T-45 Goshawk, the Mitsubishi T-2, and the Mitsubishi F-1(which resembles the Jaguar). Even following the Jaguar's retirement in Europe, the Adour continues to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> product with new variants being developed. As of February 2013, the Indian Air Force was considering fitting 125 Jaguars with new Honeywell F125IN engines.|$|E
5|$|The Pennsylvania Ministerium {{remained}} a constituent {{church of the}} General Council from 18671918. In 1918, following {{the celebration of the}} 400th anniversary of the Reformation, the three Lutheran church bodies of Eastern America (The General Synod, the General SynodSouth, and the General Council) reunited to form the United Lutheran Church in America. This event, while marking a watershed of unity among American Lutherans, also marked the end of the Pennsylvania Ministerium. The ULCA would later join with other American Lutherans, in 1962 in the Lutheran Church in America, and in 1988 in the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America (which continues to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> church body and is a direct descendant of the Pennsylvania Ministerium).|$|E
5|$|The fort {{continued}} to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> military installation throughout the British period. It {{was the scene}} of a mutiny in 1807 when Albanian soldiers of the Froberg Regiment revolted and shut themselves up in Fort Ricasoli. Despite attempts at negotiation they eventually blew up the main gunpowder magazine, causing extensive damage to the fort in the process. The mutiny was quashed by loyal troops, and some of the mutineers were condemned to death by court martial. The damaged parts of the fort were repaired, but were not rebuilt to their original design. A new magazine was built in 1829 to replace the one destroyed in the mutiny.|$|E

5|$|The {{shortcomings}} {{noted above}} limit {{the usefulness of}} the Nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form. However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve functional group tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|They {{were named}} Elefante – which morphed to Elephanta – by the colonial Portuguese {{when they found}} {{elephant}} statues on it. They established a base on the island, and its soldiers damaged the sculpture and caves. The main cave (Cave 1, or the Great Cave) was a Hindu place of worship until the Portuguese arrived, whereupon the island ceased to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> place of worship. The earliest attempts to prevent further damage to the Caves were started by British India officials in 1909. The monuments were restored in the 1970s. In 1987, the restored Elephanta Caves were designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is currently maintained by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI).|$|E
5|$|WASP-43 is a K-type {{star in the}} Sextans constellation. It {{is about}} {{half the size of}} the Sun, and has {{approximately}} half the mass. WASP-43 has one known planet in orbit, a Hot Jupiter called WASP-43b. At the time of publishing of WASP-43b's discovery on April 15, 2011, the planet was the most closely orbiting Hot Jupiter discovered. The small orbit of WASP-43b is thought to be caused by WASP-43's unusually low mass. WASP-43 was first observed between January and May 2009 by the SuperWASP project, and was found to be cooler and slightly richer in metals than the Sun. WASP-43 has also been found to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> star that rotates at a high velocity.|$|E

5|$|Having been {{elevated}} to the peerage as Viscount Bruce of Melbourne by long-time colleague Clement Attlee, he would <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> {{participant in the}} chamber, attending regularly right up until his death. Bruce {{used it as a}} platform to continue to campaign on international and national social and economic questions, and to promote recognition and representation for Australia within the Commonwealth, though by this time Australian and British interests were becoming increasingly far apart, and the British Empire was rapidly disintegrating. He also continued to lobby the British government in these years to increase its commitment to third world development and the FAO. An avid golfer his whole life, Bruce became the first Australian captain of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in 1954. From 1948 to 1952 he was President of Leander Club, while continuing to coach rowing at Cambridge University sporadically, and frequently appeared at public events both in Australia and in England.|$|E

5|$|In 1449 James II was {{declared}} {{to have reached}} his majority, but the Douglases consolidated their position and the king began a long struggle for power, leading {{to the murder of}} the 8th Earl of Douglas at Stirling Castle on 22 February 1452. This opened an intermittent civil war as James attempted to seize Douglas lands, punctuated by a series of humiliating reversals. Gradually James managed to win over the allies of the Douglases with offers of lands, titles and offices and the Douglases' forces were finally defeated at the Battle of Arkinholm on 12 May 1455. Once independent, James II proved to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> and interventionist king. He travelled the country dispensing justice and some of the unpopular policies of the following reign, such as the sale of pardons, may have originated in this period. Ambitious plans to take Orkney, Shetland and the Isle of Man came to nothing. His attempt to take Roxburgh from the English in 1460 succeeded, but at the cost of his life as he was killed by an exploding artillery piece.|$|E
5|$|Scientific {{and high}} tech {{research}} and development operations {{are located in the}} city, including the Lowell Observatory, Northern Arizona University, the United States Naval Observatory Flagstaff Station (NOFS) and the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) Flagstaff campus. Lowell Observatory continues to <b>be</b> <b>an</b> <b>active</b> astronomical observatory and a popular visitors center which hosts educational displays and tours. It has a distributed network of small telescopes which together create images of celestial bodies with much higher resolutions than any other single telescope can produce. Current research is involved in observations of near-Earth phenomena such as asteroids and comets. The observatory is also involved in a $30 million project with the Discovery Channel to build the Discovery Channel Telescope, a sophisticated, ground-based telescope with advanced optical capabilities for future projects. Lowell Observatory and NOFS are also collaborators on the major project, the Navy Prototype Optical Interferometer, on nearby Anderson Mesa. NOFS is heavily involved with the science of star catalogs and astrometry, or the positions and distances of stars and celestial objects.|$|E
