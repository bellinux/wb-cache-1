40|$|Some {{public and}} private {{services}} are called part of the Critical Infrastructure (CI), which are considered {{as the most important}} services to protect the functioning of a society and the economy.  Many CIs provide services via the Internet and thus cyber-attacks can be performed remotely.  It is now very simple and free to find and download software, which automates performing cyber-attacks.  A recent example is that two teenagers, with close to no security knowledge, created an on-line business. They would run cyber-attacks (online <b>booter</b> <b>service</b> called vDOS, as reported by Brian Krebs) for a small fee. They reportedly earned over 600, 000 USD {{in a short period of}} time by conducting a large number of automated DDoS cyber-attacks. Then Krebs was retaliated against, and the highest DDoS attack bandwidth ever recorded, 620 Gbps, was launched against Krebs. In this paper we show how cognitive learning can be used to significantly mitigate any effects of DDoS network attacks, against the critical infrastructure...|$|E
30|$|The {{predefined}} attack period reflects typical {{duration of}} amplification DDoS attack. As {{the majority of}} them stem from <b>booter</b> <b>services</b> [19, 20], they are usually shorter than 300  s [21]. After that, the network returns to regular traffic, and the attacker nodes stop adding new packets in the system. The DDoS packets that remain in the system continue to be transferred until they reach the target node, even if this takes place for t[*]>[*] 300. We follow the network operation for another 100 steps, i.e., until t[*]=[*] 400.|$|R
40|$|Distributed {{denial of}} service attacks pose {{a serious threat to}} the {{availability}} of the network infrastructures and services. GE̿ANT, the pan-European network with terabit capacities witnesses close to hundreds of DDoS attacks on a daily basis. The reason is that DDoS attacks are getting larger, more sophisticated and frequent. At the same time, it has never been easier to execute DDoS attacks, e. g., <b>Booter</b> <b>services</b> offer paying customers without any technical knowledge the possibility to perform DDoS attacks as a service. Given the increasing size, frequency and complexity of DDoS attacks, {{there is a need to}} perform a collaborative mitigation. Therefore, we developed (i) a DDoSDB to share real attack data and allow collaborators to query, compare, and download attacks, (ii) the Security attack experimentation framework to test mitigation and response capabilities and (iii) a collaborative mitigation and response process among trusted partners to disseminate security event information. In addition to these developments, we present and would like to discuss our latest research results with experienced networking operators and bridging the gap between academic research and operational business...|$|R
30|$|Study {{of recent}} attacks reveals that with little effort, next {{generation}} attack tools {{would be able}} to enact DDoS attacks that are thousand times stronger than the ones we see today [33]. One of the major concerns is that performing DDoS attack is extremely simple with websites known as Booters or Stressers that offer DDoS as a <b>service.</b> These <b>booters</b> provide cheap <b>services,</b> and the costs to perform a series of attacks is typically just a few dollars [36]. Recently, GitHub was hit by 1.35 Tbps of traffic all at once [2]. It was the most powerful attack in the history of DDoS, and the alarming fact is that no botnet was required to achieve such high traffic volume. The attackers spoofed GitHub’s IP addresses and took control of its memcached (a distributed memory system known for high performance and demand) instances. The memcached systems then return 50 times the data of the requests back to the victim. GitHub called Akamai Prolexic for DDoS mitigation service, and the assault dropped off after 8 min. GitHub was lucky enough to afford robust DDoS mitigation services, but for small to medium enterprises and financial institutions, {{there is a need for}} new low cost DDoS defense mechanisms and architectures that can be easily deployed on commodity hardware.|$|R
