50|$|In {{longitudinal}} redundancy {{checking and}} cyclic redundancy checking, <b>block</b> <b>check</b> characters are computed for, and added to, each message block transmitted. This <b>block</b> <b>check</b> character is {{compared with a}} second <b>block</b> <b>check</b> character computed by the receiver {{to determine whether the}} transmission is error free.|$|E
50|$|In telecommunications, a <b>block</b> <b>check</b> {{character}} (BCC) is {{a character}} added to a transmission block to facilitate error detection.|$|E
50|$|Many {{protocols}} use an XOR-based longitudinal {{redundancy check}} byte (often called <b>block</b> <b>check</b> character or BCC), including the serial line internet protocol (SLIP),the IEC 62056-21 standard for electrical-meter reading, smart cards as defined in ISO/IEC 7816, and the ACCESS.bus protocol.|$|E
50|$|The inner {{encoding}} {{takes the}} composite message and generates {{a stream of}} <b>check</b> <b>blocks.</b> A <b>check</b> <b>block</b> is the XOR of all the blocks from the composite message that it is attached to.|$|R
5000|$|Check {{occurs to}} a king {{whenever}} {{the king is}} {{in the path of}} an enemy rook or queen. Castle walls do not <b>block</b> <b>checks.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The best {{area for}} the king is in the corner {{opposite}} the pawn's promotion square. This keeps it from <b>blocking</b> <b>checks</b> by its queen.|$|R
50|$|A normal block ending {{character}} (ETB or ETX) {{is followed}} by a check sum (<b>block</b> <b>check</b> character or BCC). For USASCII, this is a one character longitudinal redundancy check (LRC); for Transcode and EBCDIC, the check sum is a two character cyclic redundancy check(CRC). A data frame may contain an intermediate check sum preceded by an ITB character. This ability to include intermediate check sums in a long data frame allows a considerable improvement of the error detection probability. USASCII characters are also transmitted using odd parity for additional checking.|$|E
50|$|The channel {{encoding}} {{process in}} GPRS {{as well as}} EGPRS/EDGE consists of two steps: first, a cyclic code is used to add parity bits, which are {{also referred to as}} the <b>Block</b> <b>Check</b> Sequence, followed by coding with a possibly punctured convolutional code. In GPRS, the Coding Schemes CS-1 to CS-4 specify the number of parity bits generated by the cyclic code and the puncturing rate of the convolutional code. In GPRS Coding Schemes CS-1 through CS-3, the convolutional code is of rate 1/2, i.e. each input bit is converted into two coded bits. In Coding Schemes CS-2 and CS-3, the output of the convolutional code is punctured to achieve the desired code rate. In GPRS Coding Scheme CS-4, no convolutional coding is applied.|$|E
50|$|The {{elephant}} and {{the hawk}} {{are introduced to}} {{the game in the}} following way: whenever the player moves a piece (king, queen, knight, bishop or rook) from its starting position (that hasn't already been moved), one of the pieces in hand may be placed immediately on the square just vacated. One cannot use the placing of an elephant or hawk to <b>block</b> <b>check.</b> If the player moves all his pieces from the first rank without placing one or both in hand pieces, he forfeits the right to do so. After castling, the player may put one of the pieces in hand on either the king's or the rook's square, but he may not place both pieces in hand in the same turn. Pawns may promote to a hawk or an elephant in this game (in addition to the normal chess pieces).|$|E
50|$|Obviously the decoder of {{the inner}} stage must hold <b>check</b> <b>blocks</b> which it cannot {{currently}} decode. A <b>check</b> <b>block</b> can only be decoded when {{all but one of}} the blocks which it is attached to are known. The graph to the left shows the progress of an inner decoder. The x-axis plots the number of <b>check</b> <b>blocks</b> received and the dashed line shows the number of <b>check</b> <b>blocks</b> which cannot currently be used. This climbs almost linearly at first as many <b>check</b> <b>blocks</b> with degree > 1 are received but unusable. At a certain point, some of the <b>check</b> <b>blocks</b> are suddenly usable, resolving more blocks which then causes more <b>check</b> <b>blocks</b> to be usable. Very quickly the whole file can be decoded.|$|R
2500|$|If White's {{king and}} pawn are {{moved to the}} left, White wins as in the Lucena {{position}} above. With a few exceptions, the defending rook {{must be at least}} four files over from the pawn for this defense to work (which is why the defending king should go to the short side, to not <b>block</b> <b>checks</b> by his rook).|$|R
50|$|A service {{provider}} will integrate {{some or all}} its feeds into a single filtering device or stack, sometimes in conjunction with an upstream provider performing additional filtering. The following content-control technologies have been confirmed {{to be used to}} implement all types of web blocking (includes virtual operators):Rulespace and O2 are the only known services with a public categorisation and <b>blocking</b> <b>check</b> tool.|$|R
50|$|A cyclic {{redundancy}} check {{is a type of}} hash function used to produce a checksum, which is a small integer from a large block of data, such as network traffic or computer files. CRCs are calculated before and after transmission or duplication, and compared to confirm that they are equal. A CRC detects all one- or two-bit errors, all odd errors, all burst errors if the burst is smaller than the CRC, and most of the wide-burst errors. Parity checks can be applied to single characters (VRC—vertical {{redundancy check}}), resulting an additional parity bit or to a block of data (LRC—longitudinal redundancy check), issuing a <b>block</b> <b>check</b> character. Both methods can be implemented rather easily by using an XOR operation. A trade-off is that less errors can be detected than with the CRC. Parity Checks only detect odd numbers of flipped bits. The even numbers of bit errors stay undetected. A possible improvement is the usage of both VRC and LRC, called Double Parity or Optimal Rectangular Code (ORC).|$|E
40|$|The {{paper will}} provide a {{lifecycle}} cost-benefit analysis {{of the use of}} Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) systems and a conditioned-based maintenance (CBM) concept in future aircraft. The proposed methodology is based on a discrete-event simulation for aircraft operation and maintenance and uses an optimization algorithm for the planning and scheduling of CBM tasks. In the study, a 150 -seat short-range aircraft equipped with PHM and subject to a CBM program will be analyzed. The PHM-aircraft will be compared with an Airbus A 320 -type of aircraft with maintenance expenditures equivalent to a conventional <b>block</b> <b>check</b> maintenance program. The analysis results will support the derivation of technical and economic requirements for prognostic systems and CBM planning concepts. 1...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{optimization}} {{method for}} aircraft maintenance tasks packaging and scheduling integrated in an aircraft lifecycle simulation. It is {{demonstrated that the}} developed methods are feasible to model a prognosis-based maintenance concept. Such maintenance concepts are a prerequisite for a profitable application of prognostics and health management systems in future aircraft. The applicability of the method is analyzed and economically assessed over an aircraft lifecycle considering aircraft operation. The analysis shows that {{a variation of the}} maintenance opportunities frequency for a short-range aircraft, provided in the aircraft rotation plan, can have a significant influence on the operator’s net present value (NPV). A benefit of up to 2. 8 million USD, representing 1. 2 % of the operator’s NPV, can be realized, when maintenance opportunities are provided every 3 instead of every 7 days, while aircraft utilization is assumed to be constant. Compared to a traditional <b>block</b> <b>check</b> concept the presented method leads to higher maintenance costs, under the condition that the same volume of maintenance work has to be carried out...|$|E
40|$|The General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) {{has been}} {{developed}} for the mobile radio environment to allow the migration from the traditional circuit switched connection to a more efficient packet based communication link particularly for data transfer. GPRS requires the addition of not only the GPRS software protocol stack, but also more baseband functionality for the mobile as new coding schemes have be en defined, uplink status flag detection, multislot operation and dynamic coding scheme detect. This paper concentrates on evaluating {{the performance of the}} GPRS coding scheme detection methods {{in the presence of a}} multipath fading channel with a single co-channel interferer as a function of various soft-bit data widths. It has been found that compressing the soft-bit data widths from the output of the equalizer to save memory can influence the likelihood decision of the coding scheme detect function and hence contribute to the overall performance loss of the system. Coding scheme detection errors can therefore force the channel decoder to either select the incorrect decoding scheme or have no clear decision which coding scheme to use resulting in the decoded radio block failing the <b>block</b> <b>check</b> sequence and contribute to the block error rate. For correct performance simulation, the performance of the full coding scheme detection must be taken into account...|$|E
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 28 - 31, 1996 / Town and Country Hotel and Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaThe White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) Water Supply Control System (WSCS) {{controls}} and monitors the water wells, tanks and booster pumps {{located at the}} southern end of the missile range. Figure 1 is an overview of the WSMR water supply system. The WSCS provides water for approximately 90 square miles of the 3, 700 square mile missile range. The WSCS was designed and installed in 1990 and in need of upgrading and repair. The system was evaluated and found to be only moderately functional. The WSCS consists of an IBM compatible personal computer (PC) based user interface, located at the WSMR Water Plant and Fire Dept. and industrial-type computers called Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) based stations at the Water Plant, water wells and tanks. The stations communicate over a 400 MHz radio half-duplex link. The serial message utilizes the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) and <b>Block</b> <b>Check</b> Character (BBC) type of error checking. The Master station controls pumping by downloading pump settings to the slave stations. The slave stations upload data to the master such as tank level, pump status, energy usage, gallons of water pumped and various alarms. The system was analyzed and the design was found to be sound. The system did require improvements. These improvements include adding surge suppressors, software upgrades, absolute reading flow rate sensors, and providing adequate environmental cooling for the control system. Procedures for periodic maintenance and calibration of the sensors and schedules for radio equipment maintenance were also developed. Software modifications to reduce WSMR energy usage by reducing pumping during peak energy demand times are being integrated into the WSCS. The peak energy demand times are determined by historical energy usage data...|$|E
