5000|$|<b>Bells</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} left mouth down (for safety.) Before ringing, the <b>bells</b> <b>are</b> swung {{in increasing}} arcs until the <b>bell</b> <b>is</b> mouth uppermost.

5000|$|Japanese Shintoist and Buddhist <b>bells</b> <b>are</b> used in {{religious}} ceremonies. Suzu, a homophone meaning both [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "refreshing", <b>are</b> spherical <b>bells</b> which contain metal pellets that produce {{sound from the}} inside.

50|$|Eight {{of these}} <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> cast for {{the tower of}} the second church {{building}} and were hung for ringing in the English change ringing style.

5|$|<b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> born de Benneville Bell, on February 25, 1895, in Philadelphia to John C. Bell and Fleurette de Benneville Myers. His {{father was}} an {{attorney}} who served a term as the Pennsylvania Attorney General. His older brother, John C., Jr., was born in 1892. Bert's parents were very wealthy, and his mother's lineage predated the American Revolutionary War. His father, a Quaker of the University of Pennsylvania (class of 1884) during {{the early days of}} American football, accompanied him to his first football game when <b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> six years old. Thereafter, Bell regularly engaged in football games with childhood friends.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> {{considered}} in February 1999 {{to be the}} front-runner in the mayoral race.

50|$|In most orchestral music, tubular <b>bells</b> <b>are</b> {{used when}} a <b>bell</b> sound <b>is</b> called for. In another special case, a special peal of {{hemispherical}} <b>bells</b> <b>was</b> constructed {{for use in}} performances of Sir Arthur Sullivan's cantata, The Golden Legend. Struck with mallets, they produced both tap and hum tone. But Parsifal presented a particular problem because the lowest of the Golden Legend <b>bells</b> <b>was</b> a minor tenth higher than the lowest note required for Parsifal, and the aggregate weight of the four <b>bells</b> <b>was</b> thousands of pounds.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Bells</b> <b>were</b> vitally {{important}} to daily life at any mission. The <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> rung at mealtimes, {{to call the}} Mission residents to work and to religious services, during births and funerals, to signal the approach of a ship or returning missionary, and at other times; novices were instructed in the intricate rituals associated with the ringing the mission bells. The original <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> hung from a large nearby tree for some fifteen years, until the chapel <b>bell</b> tower <b>was</b> completed in 1791. What ultimately became of the original <b>bells</b> <b>is</b> not known. New <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> cast in Chile {{for inclusion in the}} belfry of [...] "The Great Stone Church."

5000|$|There was {{originally}} {{a ring of}} six <b>bells</b> which <b>were</b> dated 1850. They were re-hung in 1920 and again in 1987. In 2003 two additional <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> cast, making a total ring of eight. [...] The original <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> made by Charles and George Mears at the Whitechapel Bell Foundry, and the later <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> cast by John Taylor Bellfounders.|$|R
5|$|<b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> {{elected as}} the Member of Parliament for North Durham from February to June 1874, and for The Hartlepools from 1875 to 1880. He lost {{his seat in}} North Durham in 1874 {{on the grounds that}} his agents were guilty of intimidation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> then an {{employee}} of the Ritz-Carlton in Philadelphia. At one point, he tried his hand as a stock broker and lost $50,000 (presently, $) during the Wall Street Crash of 1929. His father bailed him out of his deprivation, and he returned to working at the Ritz. From 1930 until 1932, he was a backfield coach for the Temple Owls football team. In 1932, Marshall tried to coax Bell into buying the rights to a NFL franchise, but Bell disparaged the league and ridiculed the idea. When Pop Warner was hired to coach Temple for the 1933 season, Warner chose to hire his own assistants and <b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> let go.|$|E
5|$|City {{officials}} {{scheduled a}} public celebration with free {{food and drink}} for the testing of the recast bell. When the <b>bell</b> <b>was</b> struck, it did not break, but the sound produced was described by one hearer as like two coal scuttles being banged together. Mocked by the crowd, Pass and Stow hastily took the bell away and again recast it. When {{the fruit of the}} two founders' renewed efforts was brought forth in June 1753, the sound was deemed satisfactory, though Norris indicated that he did not personally like it. The <b>bell</b> <b>was</b> hung in the steeple of the State House the same month.|$|E

The remaining eight were cast by the McShane Bell Foundry of Baltimore, Maryland. The <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> solemnly blessed on November 27, 1881 by Bishop Winand Wigger of Newark. The pitch of the heaviest <b>bell</b> <b>is</b> C in the middle octave.In about 1955 the <b>bells</b> <b>were</b> fitted with an electric striking mechanism, controlled by a small keyboard located in the gallery.

At the next NFL owners' meeting, <b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> worried the repercussions from this event would lead to his firing. However, he was pleasantly surprised to learn that his contract would be elevated to five years at $30,000 per year. Reinvigorated with renewed support, he persuaded the owners to allow him to put sudden-death overtime into the playoffs.|$|E

5|$|A {{clock is}} {{documented}} in this tower since 1405, {{when a new}} <b>bell</b> <b>was</b> installed. The city accounts of 1438 mention the repair of the clockworks.

5|$|After Washington's {{defeat at}} the Battle of Brandywine on September 11, 1777, the revolutionary capital of Philadelphia was defenseless, {{and the city}} {{prepared}} for what {{was seen as an}} inevitable British attack. Bells could easily be recast into munitions, and locals feared the Liberty Bell and other bells would meet this fate. The <b>bell</b> <b>was</b> hastily taken down from the tower, and sent by heavily guarded wagon train to the town of Bethlehem. Local wagoneers transported the bell to the Zion German Reformed Church in Northampton Town, now Allentown, where it waited out the British occupation of Philadelphia under the church floor boards. It was returned to Philadelphia in June 1778, after the British departure. With the steeple of the State House in poor condition (the steeple was subsequently torn down and later restored), the <b>bell</b> <b>was</b> placed in storage, and it was not until 1785 that it was again mounted for ringing.|$|E
5|$|After his April 2000 release, Bell {{publicly}} {{announced that}} he believed that there was extensive Federal Government corruption associated with his 1997–2000 criminal case, {{and that he was}} going to research the facts and file a lawsuit. Bell filed this lawsuit in 2003. <b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> put under heavy surveillance and rearrested for harassment and stalking of federal agents. He was charged with intimidation and stalking and was convicted and again imprisoned, this time for a decade-long sentence. Bell protested vociferously against the conduct of the trial, going so far as to file civil lawsuits against two judges, at least two prosecutors, his former probation officers, and his defense attorneys, but ultimately to no avail. He was released in December 2009, only to be rearrested in July 2010 for violating his parole conditions. Bell's parole violation hearing resulted in another sentence, and <b>Bell</b> <b>was</b> released on March 12, 2012.|$|E
