5|$|At the time, Peckinpah {{wanted to}} make Emperor of the North Pole (1973), a story set during the Great Depression about a <b>brakeman</b> obsessed with keeping {{homeless}} people off his train. The film's producer {{made a deal with}} Paramount Pictures' production chief Robert Evans, allowing Peckinpah to do his personal project if he first directed The Getaway. The director was soon dismissed from Emperor and told that Paramount was not making The Getaway.|$|E
5|$|Within {{a week of}} Disneyland's {{opening on}} July 17, 1955, a <b>brakeman</b> pulled the switch {{connecting}} the Disneyland Railroad's main line with a siding at Main Street, U.S.A. Station too soon as the Retlaw 2 freight train on the siding was passing the Retlaw 1 passenger train stopped at the station on the main line. The caboose {{on the end of}} the freight train had not made it fully across the switch when it was pulled, and as a result the caboose's front set of wheels correctly traveled along the siding while the rear set of wheels incorrectly traveled along the main line towards the passenger train, causing the caboose to swing to the side before colliding with a concrete slab and derailing upon impact. During the ensuing commotion, the erring <b>brakeman,</b> presumably to avoid disciplinary action, quietly left the scene of the accident, exited the park, and was not seen again. No injuries were reported, and by the following year the use of sidings at stations on the DRR's main line came to an end.|$|E
5|$|A {{veteran of}} the Spanish–American War, Neuer worked as a <b>brakeman</b> before taking up {{baseball}} professionally. He played for various minor league teams in 1905 and 1907 before making his debut for the New York Highlanders. With New York, he threw three shutouts in seven games, and was praised by manager Clark Griffith for his pitching ability during that stretch. However, his control deteriorated after that season, {{and over the next}} three years he played for various minor league teams. He retired after 1910 and became an umpire. He then worked at Bendix Aviation until his retirement in 1942.|$|E
50|$|The Brotherhood {{was founded}} on 23 September 1883 in Oneonta, New York by eight <b>brakemen</b> in Delaware and Hudson Railway Caboose No. 10.The {{original}} name was the Brotherhood of Railroad <b>Brakemen.</b> At the time, wages were just over $1 a day. The work was dangerous, with 33% of <b>brakemen</b> being injured {{in the year of}} foundation. The Brotherhood offered death coverage of up to $300, and was the only way members could obtain insurance. The Brotherhood's insurance department was established in 1885 and maximum death benefits raised to $600. The union restricted membership to whites.|$|R
50|$|In Germany, the <b>brakemen</b> {{occupied}} brakeman's cabins {{on several}} or even all wagons in a train and would operate the wagon brakes when signaled by the engine driver. It {{was a dangerous}} and uncomfortable role, especially in winter when {{it was not uncommon}} for <b>brakemen</b> to freeze to death in the unheated cabins.|$|R

5|$|Crop {{damage was}} worst along the Indian River Lagoon; several farms in Stuart {{experienced}} total losses, and statewide, 16% of the citrus crop, or 4million boxes, were destroyed. Many chicken coops in Stuart were destroyed, {{and the local}} chicken population was scattered and dispersed as far as Indiantown. Across southeastern Florida, the hurricane damaged 6,465houses and destroyed another 383, causing over $3million in damage. One person, an African American farm worker, was killed when his shack blew down in Gomez, a <b>brakeman</b> died after sevenrailcars derailed, and a child was killed by airborne debris.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{students}} from Michigan Technological University solved {{the mystery of}} the Paulding Light, a local phenomenon commonly attributed to paranormal activity. The phenomenon is viewable from a section of Robbins Pond Road, the former routing of US45 in the Paulding area. According to area folklore, and indicated on signs in the viewing area, the light is from the ghost of a railroad <b>brakeman.</b> Other explanations say the light comes from a ghost train from the 1800s. The students' investigation showed that the light comes from headlights of cars on US45 in the Paulding area.|$|E
5|$|Neuer {{was born}} in Fremont, Ohio, {{and was one of}} eight {{children}} born to Henry Neuer and Jennie Catherman. He and his family moved to Sunbury, Pennsylvania, when he was a child. In 1898, Neuer enlisted in the Spanish–American War as a private, and was discharged the following year. After his discharge, he worked as a <b>brakeman</b> for a local railroad for the next few years. In late 1904, the Detroit Tigers intended to sign Neuer to a contract. However, nothing came of it and he never played a game with the organization.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years of the railway, <b>brakemen</b> just had an open seat. The first cabs {{appeared}} around 1880. The number of brakeman's cabs occupied in a given train depended on the conditions of the route and the speed of the train; on some trains all the cabs might be occupied. Communication between engine driver and <b>brakemen</b> was by train whistle signals which required the design of the brakeman's cab to be partially open to the elements.|$|R
5|$|The first Australian {{to compete}} in {{bobsleigh}} represented Great Britain. Frederick McEvoy drove the British two-man and four-man bobsleighs in 1936, earning fourth place and a bronze respectively, and carried the British flag at the opening ceremony. Australia first competed in bobsleigh in 1988, and has competed in the event in every Olympics since, except for 2002. Paul Narracott became the first Australian to compete at both the Summer and Winter Olympics: he competed in the 1984 Summer Olympics in athletics, and participated in bobsleigh in 1992 as the <b>brakeman.</b> Australia competed in luge in 1992 and 1994. They did not compete in skeleton in 2002.|$|E
5|$|At 11:30am, March 27, {{recognizing}} {{his description}} from a newspaper story, the engineer and <b>brakeman</b> of a train, from Philadelphia to Jersey City, crossing the Hackensack Bridge, spotted Jackalow running towards the woods. First two, then eight, New Jersey police officers {{went into the}} woods after him. Around noon, Jackalow was turned away from crossing a railroad bridge, then under construction in Newark, New Jersey, by workman William Jacobus, who recognized Jackalow. His colleague Henry Wilson mentioned a $1000 reward for Jackalow's arrest, and the pair—joined by John Sanford and John Douglass, and aided by a spy glass—spotted Jackalow heading for the Newark Plank Road. Jacobus and Douglass pursued Jackalow, while Wilson and Sanford took the car to Newark, hired a horse, {{and set out to}} intercept him on the road.|$|E
5|$|He {{was born}} Nils Johan Nilsen to a Norwegian family in Seljeskog in Salangen on 3 June 1894, {{as the oldest}} of six children. As a child, Nelsen was an active skier and ski jumper, with more than fifteen ski jumps located in the area. In 1913, his family emigrated to Big Eddy near Revelstoke. Once in Canada, he anglicized his name. His brother, Ivind Nilsen was also a {{champion}} ski jumper, and became among other things Boy's World Champion in 1922. Ivind, who chose not to anglicize his last name, {{was known for his}} supreme style, while Nels was better known for his length. Nelsen married Emma Pickard, with whom he had ten children. Except for a brief period as a ski instructor, he worked as a <b>brakeman</b> and conductor for the Canadian Pacific Railway, whose flexibility made it easer to participate in tournaments. He moved to North Vancouver where he raised his family.|$|E
50|$|The Brotherhood was {{organized}} into lodges. Its executive was elected {{every four years}} at the Grand Lodge Convention, including the president. There were four governing boards: the Board of Directors, Board of Trustees and Insurance, Board of Appeals, and Executive Board. Members in rail service included conductors and their assistants, dining car stewards, ticket collectors, train baggagemen, <b>brakemen,</b> and train flagmen. Member in yard service included yardmasters, yard conductors, switchtenders, foremen, flagmen, <b>brakemen,</b> switchmen, car tenders, operators, hump riders, and car operators.|$|R
25|$|The link-and-pin coupler {{consisted}} of a tube-like body that received an oblong link. During coupling, a rail worker had to stand between the cars as they came together and guide the link into the coupler pocket. Once the cars were joined, the employee inserted a pin into a hole {{a few inches from}} the end of the tube to hold the link in place. This procedure was exceptionally dangerous and many <b>brakemen</b> lost fingers or entire hands when they did not get them out of the way of the coupler pockets in time. Many more were killed as a result of being crushed between cars or dragged under cars that were coupled too quickly. <b>Brakemen</b> were issued with heavy clubs that could be used to hold the link in position, but many <b>brakemen</b> would not use the club, and risked injury.|$|R
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of April 7, 1912, the MK&T train #5, with engine MK&T 367, was called out of Smithville for an 8:00am route.

The train was scheduled to meet train #6, which was set to leave northbound out of Houston at 2:00am. Train #6, with MK&T engine 544, was a fast freight train with no passengers aboard. On board were conductor Scoggins, <b>brakemen</b> Jones and Rightmer, engineer Hawkins, and foreman Brown.|$|R
5|$|In the two-woman event, {{defending}} {{world champion}} Nicole Minichiello of Britain had her sled flip over after turn 12 {{during the third}} run, but both Minichiello and her <b>brakeman</b> Gillian Cooke {{walked away from the}} crash. Minichiello and Cooke decided not to start the final run. In the final run, Russia-2's sled crashed which kept them at their finishing position of 18th. Meanwhile, the Germany-2 sled of Cathleen Martini and Romy Logsch was in fourth place after the third run, but was disqualified after Martini crashed in turn 13 of the final run, causing Logsch to be ejected from the sled. Both Martini and Logsch walked away from the crash by themselves. Before this incident, Martini had never crashed before in her career. Canada's Kaillie Humphries and Heather Moyse won the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{station has}} been the site of several major {{accidents}} involving locomotives. In 1843, the Sloatsburg station {{was the site of}} a large accident by train full of milk bottles. On December 31, 1855, the railroad's Cincinnati Express was thrown off the tracks near the Sloatsburg station, when it tried to avoid a countrymen and his four mules, who were crossing the tracks. Three of the mules were killed and mutilated by the train, while the fourth died soon after. There was no damage to the cars or injuries to the passengers. In the early days of August 1856, a girl by the name of McGraff was injured by an oncoming train near the station after carelessly walking onto the tracks. The parents, who were in a poor state financially, was given $45 (1856 USD) in return for their troubles from the Board of Directors in nearby Goshen. On February 21, 1858, a train heading southbound experienced an accident when a <b>brakeman,</b> John Freeland, fell off the train and was run over. Freeland's legs were severed in the incident, and one arm was broken. They hurried Freeland southbound on a nearby train, but died by the time the train reached Paterson, New Jersey towards the hospital.|$|E

25|$|Before the {{development}} of locomotive-actuated train braking systems in the late 19th century, designated railroad employees known as <b>brakemen</b> would move about the tops of cars, setting hand brakes {{in an effort to}} stop the train in a timely manner. This process was imprecise and extremely dangerous. Many <b>brakemen</b> lost life and limb as a result of falling from a moving train, icy and wet conditions often adding to the hazards involved in negotiating the top of a swaying boxcar. In the U.S., an 1893 federal law, the Railroad Safety Appliance Act, required automatic brakes on all railroads, effective in 1900.|$|R
50|$|During {{the period}} from 1951 to 1954 various {{agreements}} were made over wage increases, cost of living adjustments and rules changes.The order had been accepting <b>brakemen</b> as members since the 1930s, and in 1954 the union {{changed its name to}} the Order of Railway Conductors and <b>Brakemen</b> (ORC&B). On May 26, 1955, after mediation, a strike ballot and Presidential Emergency Board 109, the order achieved agreement on a graduated rate of pay system. Further gains were made in 1964, when employees won paid holidays and expenses away from home, and in 1966 when further improvements to wages and benefits were gained.|$|R

50|$|Strikebreakers {{were hired}} by the railway {{in order to keep}} the line open, many of whom had little railway experience, making the already {{dangerous}} job of coupling and uncoupling cars performed by switchmen in the yards and on the sidings even more deadly. Consequently, the strike against the CB&Q was joined on March 23 by the members of the SMAA. The railway <b>brakemen</b> remained on the job, however, helping to operate the trains of the CB&Q while the three brotherhoods of the running trades were on strike, although the level ill feeling on the part of striking engineers, firemen, and switchmen towards the <b>brakemen</b> was said to be comparatively small.|$|R
