40|$|An {{analysis}} of <b>basic</b> <b>vehicle</b> characteristics {{required to meet}} the Fundamental Aeronautics Program s 70 percent energy consumption reduction goal for commercial airliners in the 2030 to 2035 timeframe was conducted. A total of 29 combinations of vehicle parasitic drag coefficient, vehicle induced drag coefficient, vehicle empty weight and engine Specific Fuel Consumption were used to create sized tube-and-wing vehicle models. The mission fuel burn {{for each of these}} sized vehicles was then compared to a baseline current technology vehicle. A response surface equation was generated of fuel burn reduction {{as a function of the}} four <b>basic</b> <b>vehicle</b> performance metrics, so that any values of the performance metrics up to a 50 percent reduction could be used to estimate fuel burn reduction of tube-and-wing aircraft for future studies...|$|R

40|$|The {{effectiveness}} {{and efficiency of}} railway <b>vehicle</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring is increasingly critical to railway operations as it directly affects safety, reliability, maintenance efficiency, and overall system performance. Although there are {{a vast number of}} railway <b>vehicle</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring technologies, wayside systems are becoming increasingly popular because of the reduced cost of a single monitoring point, and because they do not interfere with the existing railway line. Acoustic sensing and visual imaging are two wayside monitoring technologies that can be applied to monitor the <b>condition</b> of <b>vehicle</b> components such as roller bearing, gearboxes, couplers, and pantographs, etc. The central hypothesis of this thesis is {{that it is possible to}} integrate acoustic sensing and visual imaging technologies to achieve enhancement in condition monitoring of railway vehicles. So this thesis presents improvements in railway <b>vehicle</b> <b>condition</b> monitoring through the integration of acoustic sensing and visual imaging technologies...|$|R

Unfortunately, two skill areas are not clearly defined or assessed by ASE: <b>Basic</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Interval Maintenance Skills and <b>Basic</b> <b>Vehicle</b> Repair Skills, which combine to form the Automotive Service Technology Foundational Skills (ASTFS). A qualitative analysis of emergent systems patterns was used to construct a table of specifications for ASTFS, which can facilitate curriculum development and assessment.
