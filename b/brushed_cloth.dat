5000|$|Hundreds {{of people}} {{lived at the}} 300-acre Shaker village {{on both sides of}} Shaker Hill Road, which {{included}} a school, gardens, orchards, a grist and saw mill, farm land, barns, a dairy and shops. They made brooms, <b>brushes,</b> woven <b>cloth,</b> woodenware, spinning wheels, horsehair sieves, oval carriers and fancy goods. They reaped seeds and herbs and made herbal medicines. Key intentions among the Shakers were to live a simple life in harmony, respect nature, and produce well-made or cared for agricultural or material products. The village made a number of goods and products and was noted for [...] "spiritualistic healing of the sick," [...] but the daily operations were difficult to manage and the village was not economically successful due to the competition of manufactured goods. Elder Joseph Brackett wrote the famous 1848 Shaker dancing song, Simple Gifts.|$|R
50|$|Lotions {{are applied}} to {{external}} skin with bare hands, a <b>brush,</b> a clean <b>cloth,</b> cotton wool, or gauze. While lotion {{may be used as}} a medicine delivery system, many lotions, especially hand lotions and body lotions are meant instead to simply smooth, moisturize and soften the skin. These may be used in anti-aging lotions, which can also be classified as a cosmetic in many cases, and may contain fragrances. The Food and Drug Administration voiced concern about lotions not classified as drugs that advertise anti-aging or anti-wrinkle properties.|$|R
40|$|There are {{surprisingly}} many anisotropically reflecting {{objects in the}} real world. Some examples are <b>brushed</b> metal, <b>cloth,</b> CDs, and even many brands of paper. Despite the importance of anisotropic reflections in the real world, most of todays computer graphics systems cannot deal with them appropriately. This is particularly true for interactive and hardware-accelerated rendering systems, which is mostly {{due to the fact}} that so far there has been no model for simulating anisotropy with commonly available computer graphics hardware. In this paper we describe a novel approach for simulating anisotropic reflections on OpenGLbased architectures in real time. The rendering of an anisotropic surface with one light source is exactly as expensive as the rendering of the same surface with traditional texturing and lighting. It is therefore possible in real time, even on low-end workstations and PCs. 1 Introduction Many of the objects we know from day-to-day life have anisotropic surfaces. Oft [...] ...|$|R
50|$|If {{the cradle}} cap is not severe, it could simply be combed out gently after bathing. The {{softened}} scales {{can then be}} brushed away with a soft <b>brush,</b> comb or <b>cloth,</b> but if not done very gently, this could worsen the condition and bring about temporary hair loss. Applying petroleum jelly (e.g., Vaseline) liberally overnight is another popular treatment. The softened scales either fall off during the night, or can be brushed off in the morning. Making a paste from sodium bicarbonate (baking soda) and leaving it on the affected area for 10 minutes can also help lift the scales. There have been no studies done on these treatments.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The heat {{transfer}} performance of heat exchanger plate decreases {{as time goes}} by. The main reason for this phenomenon is the fouling of the heat exchanger plates. To remove the fouling, we have usually cleaned the plate of heat exchanger using chemicals or polishing <b>brush</b> or <b>cloth</b> with hand after stopping the equipment and disassembling the heat exchanger. However, to clean the plate using these methods, the heat exchanger equipment needs to be stopped and disjointed. In addition, it must be re-jointed after cleaning. Especially, the concern of environmental pollution happens in case of using chemicals. Therefore, {{we need to develop}} an automatic fouling removal equipment which can continuously keep high {{heat transfer}} efficiency and solve the problem of environmental pollution. So, in this paper, we developed and tested the equipment which can clean the fouling on heat exchanger plates automatically per constant period and interval using air bubbles. The total heat transfer coefficient decreased with a slower tendency when using air bubbles compared to the existing methods. There was 10 % higher heat transfer effect air bubbles every 10 minutes for 2 hours to remove the fouling ingredients on the heat transfer surface area concerned to the case without air bubbles after 192 hours...|$|R
60|$|A {{long time}} ago, [Endnote: 1] {{in a town}} with which I used to be familiarly acquainted, there dwelt an elderly person of grim aspect, known by the name and title of Doctor Grimshawe,[Endnote: 2] whose {{household}} consisted of a remarkably pretty and vivacious boy, and a perfect rosebud of a girl, {{two or three years}} younger than he, and an old maid-of-all-work, of strangely mixed breed, crusty in temper and wonderfully sluttish in attire. [Endnote: 3] It might be partly owing to this handmaiden's characteristic lack of neatness (though primarily, no doubt, to the grim Doctor's antipathy to broom, <b>brush,</b> and dusting- <b>cloths)</b> that the house--at least in such portions of it as any casual visitor caught a glimpse of--was so overlaid with dust, that, in lack of a visiting card, you might write your name with your forefinger upon the tables; and so hung with cobwebs that they assumed the appearance of dusky upholstery.|$|R
60|$|At last we {{made out}} {{way to the}} Mynheer Fronk's house, where we had been told we should find my Lord Walwyn's lodgings. It was a very tall house, with a cradle for a stork's nest at the top, {{and one of the}} birds {{standing}} on a single long thin leg on the ridge of the very high roof. There were open stalls for cheese {{on either side of the}} door, and a staircase leading up between. Sir Andrew made it known to a Dutchman, in a broad hat, that we were Lord Walwyn's sisters come to see him, and he thereupon called a stout maid, in a snowy round cap and kerchief, who in the first place looked at our shoes, then produced a <b>brush</b> and a <b>cloth,</b> and, going down on her knees, proceeded to wipe them and clean them. Sir Andrew submitted, as one quite accustomed to the process, and told us we might think ourselves fortunate that she did not actually insist on carrying us all upstairs, as some Dutch maids would do with visitors, rather than permit the purity of their stairs and passages to be soiled.|$|R
40|$|During last August 1 {{learned that}} the pigs on the College Farm were being troubled with lice. I had for some time been anxious to try the {{kerosene}} emulsion remedy against these disgusting pests as used so successfully {{for the destruction of}} cattle lice last winter and reported upon in Bulletin 5 of this station. Mixtures of kerosene and lard, and lard and sulphur, as ordinarily recommended against parasites upon domestic animals were first tried that I might know from experience how much of a task it would be to use these substances in the usual way. As I had anticipated, it was found to be a tedious operation if many animals were to be treated and especially if they were wild. In fact I {{came to the conclusion that}} any remedy like the preceding where oils or washes are to be applied with a <b>cloth,</b> <b>brush</b> or curry comb, can hardly be practical except in cases where the lice are very abundant or where there are but a few very valuable tame animals that do not object to being handled. At least, this method of treatment would be very unsatisfactory in most cases...|$|R
40|$|Marine {{exploration}} is {{the foundation}} for understanding ocean systems with autonomous, distributed, underwater communication networks with remote sensing and monitoring. Currently, battery delivered power is {{the most widely used}} resource for underwater operations, nonetheless is not sustainable for long-term deployments. Effective energy harvesting from the oceans is critical for ocean exploration, national security, and real-time monitoring, as it is of enormous social and economic value. Benthic Microbial Fuel Cells (BMFCs) could be a low-cost alternative to power remote oceanographic applications by means of harnessing the bioenergy from benthic sediments. Microbially mediated redox reactions, extracellular electron transport processes, and accompanying organic matter degradation are the underlying principles of BMFCs. The dissertation research targeted development of a novel distributed benthic microbial fuel cell (DBMFC) system, to address some of the concerns governing long-term energy requirements for underwater monitoring. In particular, distributed multi-anode/cathode configuration with optimized system design was incorporated for enhanced stability of DBMFCs in the harsh natural environment. Computational model which integrated bio-physiochemical functioning of a BMFC system were incorporated and corroborated with experimental results. Novel carbon-based activated nanofibers (ACNF) anode and bi-layer (BL) platinum-free biocathode: activated carbon cathodes (ACC) were evaluated for their performance in microbial fuel cells (MFCs), BMFCs, and eventually DBMFC systems. In addition, a Power Management System (PMS) system was developed and coupled with batch mode BMFC to augment the output and power working loads. Further, to better understand microbially mediated biogeochemical processes in real time, the consortium associated with BMFC systems were analyzed using molecular biology techniques. The commercialization potential of BMFCs was as well studied to grasp the various application avenues in underwater cyber technology space. The overall performance of the DBMFC system greatly improved over previously demonstrated BMFC systems with a single electrode setup. Stability characterization and computational model simulations confirmed that multi-anode/cathode arrays delivered sufficient power and current yields, whilst arrays were being impaired to mimic adverse environmental bioturbation conditions. ACNF as MFC anode in comparison to the other commonly used substrates (GAC: granular activated carbon, CB: carbon <b>brush,</b> CC: carbon <b>cloth)</b> exhibited excellent prospects for scale up applications in MFC and BMFC systems. Novel activated carbon-based cathodes (ACC) were successfully tested as alternative biocathodes for high stability and improved long-term power generation in BMFCs. The Power Management System (PMS) system was developed and coupled with batch mode BMFC system, augmenting the output load voltage. The finding would significantly improve the efficiency, stability, and durability of BMFC systems to actively power underwater sensor systems and thereby good commercialization prospects. The contributions from the research study integrated numerous lab-scale and field investigations of novel electrode materials, wastewater/ benthic MFC configurations, power management schemes, and microbial ecology analysis. Based on the success of the pilot-scale tests of DBMFCs, the use of novel cost-effective electrode materials integrated with the multi-electrode approach will be the next generation of BMFC systems...|$|R
