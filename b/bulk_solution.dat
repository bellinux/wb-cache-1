25|$|A calcium {{silicate}} feedstock, made from processed steel slag, {{can also be}} used to neutralize active acidity in AMD systems by removing free hydrogen ions from the <b>bulk</b> <b>solution,</b> thereby increasing pH. As the silicate anion captures H+ ions (raising the pH), it forms monosilicic acid (H4SiO4), a neutral solute. Monosilicic acid remains in the <b>bulk</b> <b>solution</b> to play many roles in correcting the adverse effects of acidic conditions. In the <b>bulk</b> <b>solution,</b> the silicate anion is very active in neutralizing H+ cations in the soil solution. While its mode-of-action is quite different from limestone, the ability of {{calcium silicate}} to neutralize acid solutions is equivalent to limestone as evidenced by its CCE value of 90-100% and its relative neutralizing value of 98%.|$|E
25|$|There exist {{several ways}} to coat the inner surface with {{specific}} charges. Diffusion-limited patterning can be utilized because a <b>bulk</b> <b>solution</b> only penetrate the entrance of a nanochannel within a certain distance. Because the diffusion speed is different for each reactant. By introducing several steps of reactants flowing into the nanochannel, {{it is possible to}} pattern the surface with different surface charges inside the channel.|$|E
25|$|In the {{presence}} of heavy metals, calcium silicate reacts in a different manner than limestone. As limestone raises the pH of the <b>bulk</b> <b>solution,</b> and if heavy metals are present, precipitation of the metal hydroxides (with extremely low solubilities) is normally accelerated and the potential of armoring of limestone particles increases significantly. In the calcium silicate aggregate, as silicic acid species are absorbed onto the metal surface, the development of silica layers (mono- and bi-layers) lead {{to the formation of}} colloidal complexes with neutral or negative surface charges. These negatively charged colloids create an electrostatic repulsion with each other (as well as with the negatively charged calcium silicate granules) and the sequestered metal colloids are stabilized and remain in a dispersed state - effectively interrupting metal precipitation and reducing vulnerability of the material to armoring.|$|E

[1], which yields information about the water dynamics within the ion’s hydration shell. For an application to confined diffusion, this description is extended by introducing a tortuosity factor.

25|$|To {{choose the}} matrix for each solid analyte, three {{criteria}} must be considered. First, it should dissolve the solid compound to be analysed (with {{or without the}} aid of a cosolvent or additive), thus allowing molecules of that compound to diffuse to the surface layers, replenishing the sample molecules that have been ionized or destroyed by interaction with the fast atom beam. It {{should also be noted that}} another mechanism for explanation of ion formation in FAB involves the idea that sputtering occurs from the bulk rather than the surface, but in that case, the solubility is still largely important to insure homogeneity of solid analyte in the <b>bulk</b> <b>solution.</b> Secondly, the matrix should have a low volatility under the conditions of the mass spectrometer. As mentioned above, as the matrix is depleted, the ionization decreases as well, so maintaining the matrix is vital. Thirdly, the matrix should not react with the solid analyte in question, or if it does react, it should be in an understood and reproducible way. This ensures reproducibility of analysis and identification of the actual analyte rather than a derivative of the analyte.|$|E

2500|$|Garrels and Thompson (1962) first applied {{chemical}} modeling to geochemistry in 25°C and one atmosphere total pressure. [...] Their calculation, computed by hand, is {{now known}} as an equilibrium model, which predicts species distributions, mineral saturation states, and gas fugacities from measurements of <b>bulk</b> <b>solution</b> composition. By removing small aliquots of solvent water from an equilibrated spring water and repeatedly recalculating the species distribution, Garrels and Mackenzie (1967) simulated the reactions that occur as spring water evaporated. This coupling of mass transfer with an equilibrium model, known as a reaction path model, enabled geochemists to simulate reaction processes.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of brane cosmology, a {{scenario}} where our universe is a 3 + 1 -dimensional surface (the "brane'') embedded in a five-dimensional spacetime (the "bulk''), we study geometries for which the brane is anisotropic - more specifically Bianchi I - though still homogeneous. We first obtain explicit vacuum <b>bulk</b> <b>solutions</b> with anisotropic three-dimensional spatial slices. The bulk {{is assumed to be}} empty but endowed with a negative cosmological constant. We then embed Z_ 2 -symmetric branes in the anisotropic spacetimes and discuss the constraints on the brane energy-momentum tensor due to the five-dimensional anisotropic geometry. We show that if the bulk is static, an anisotropic brane cannot support a perfect fluid. However, we find that for some of our <b>bulk</b> <b>solutions</b> it is possible to embed a brane with a perfect fluid though its energy density and pressure are completely determined by the bulk geometry...|$|R

The electrochemical and chemical processes taking place on Fe have been studied using x-ray absorption, current density mapping of the iron surface and artificial pits.

The oxide formed was electrochemically active and changes in valence states between 2 + and 3 + were observed during electrochemical cycling between the passive state and hydrogen evolution. The oxide continued to thicken during the cycling with very little dissolution or any conversion back to the metallic state.
