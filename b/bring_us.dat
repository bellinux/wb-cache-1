500|$|Two {{different}} versions of the song, each with different lyrics, were recorded: in the album version, the second line of the second verse, [...] "Any deal that we endeavor/Boys and girls feel good together", was changed in the single version to: [...] "Once again if we endeavour/Love will <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> back together". Victoria Beckham sings on the single version, while Halliwell sings on the album version, after Halliwell confessed that she had a hard time singing on that particular key. The single version appears in the music video, and on stage the girls always performed the single version before and after Halliwell's departure.|$|E
500|$|Hours {{following}} the second concert, {{the attacks on}} the World Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon outside of Washington, D.C., and a crash near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, resulted in the loss of 2,993 lives.

[...] "I'm not one to sit back and say, 'Oh, I feel bad for what happened to them I want the whole world to sing , to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> together as a world, because a song is a mantra, something you repeat over and over. And we need peace, we need giving, we need love, we need unity." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1993, McCain opposed {{military}} operations in Somalia, saying it was [...] "an unfocused mission that lacks an objective"; after 18American deaths in the Battle of Mogadishu, he introduced a resolution to <b>bring</b> <b>U.S.</b> forces home immediately, but it was defeated in the Senate. [...] McCain similarly opposed Operation Uphold Democracy in Haiti in 1994. [...] He was initially opposed to U.S. military involvement in the Bosnian War, voting against the George H. W. Bush administration on a 1992 resolution that would have authorized [...] "demonstrations of force" [...] {{in conjunction with the}} Operation Provide Promise humanitarian relief effort there. [...] McCain's view changed after the 1995 Srebrenica Massacre, and he voted in favor of the resolution authorizing the 1995 NATO bombing in Bosnia and Herzegovina against the Bosnian Serb Army.|$|E

500|$|When the {{hostilities}} were over, on 16 May 1945, Éamon de Valera, in {{his speech}} to the nation said: [...] "To the men of our Mercantile Marine who faced all the perils of the ocean to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> essential supplies, the nation is profoundly grateful." [...] The Ringsend area of Dublin has a long maritime tradition. When housing was being redeveloped in the 1970s, some streets were named after ships which were lost: Breman Road, Breman Grove, Cymric Road, Isolda Road, Pine Road, Leukos Road, Kyleclare Road and Clonlara Road.

500|$|Conservative media figure Glenn Beck (who {{joined the}} LDS Church in 1999) has alleged that President Barack Obama [...] "is going to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> to {{the verge of}} {{shredding}} the Constitution, of massive socialism." [...] On November 14, 2008—following Obama's election—Beck appeared on Bill O'Reilly's show The O'Reilly Factor and said that [...] "we are {{at the place where}} the Constitution hangs in the balance, I feel the Constitution is hanging in the balance right now, hanging by a thread unless the good Americans wake up." [...] Earlier in November, while interviewing U.S. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah (also a Mormon), Beck remarked: [...] "I heard Barack Obama talk about the Constitution and I thought, we are at the point or we are very near the point where our Constitution is hanging by a thread." [...] Hatch appeared on Beck's Fox News show in January 2009, and Beck prompted him by declaring [...] "I believe our Constitution hangs by a thread." ...|$|E

Stone, in response to the State of the Union Address, said [...] "What I will walk away with ... is how the president said we are still a strong country ... {{he made it clear that}} we aren't dealing with a giant war, but with low grade thugs," [...] and finished by commenting [...] "In the grand scheme, they can't <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> down." [...] When asked which presidential candidate he supported in the 2016 United States presidential election, Stone declined to comment, wanting to maintain the public non-partisan stand of the military.|$|E

500|$|In September 2000, Herndon {{reunited with}} McBride and Thomas after meeting {{them at a}} party at the Handlebar-J Restaurant & Bar in Scottsdale, Arizona, to {{celebrate}} the club's 25th anniversary. After they performed [...] "No More Cryin'" [...] there, Herndon suggested that they officially reunite as McBride & the Ride, saying [...] "This thing in my gut was telling me that this was the right time for this." [...] The trio recorded demo tapes and began searching for a record deal, signing to the independent Dualtone Records in 2002. Working with pianist and record producer Matt Rollings, McBride & the Ride recorded its only album for Dualtone, titled Amarillo Sky, and released it in September of that year. Unlike previous albums, the band wrote most of the songs and played most of the instruments itself because, according to Thomas, [...] "Terry thought this would be even more of a band-like situation if we wrote together more.

500|$|The {{earliest}} {{reviews of}} the album, published by the LA Weekly and Newsweek, were positive. Rolling Stone critic Christian Hoard wrote that [...] "Octagon's verses often feel unfocused and random, but when he bears down he can be mesmerizing, channeling his quick-tongued rhymes with streetwise brassiness and cosmic vibrations." [...] Allmusic reviewer Marisa Brown wrote that the album [...] "doesn't always {{make a lot of}} sense, but that's the beauty of it. It's a kind of concept album that concentrates more on the actual overall sound than the concepts. Its elements are all on the very edge of control, which is both exhilarating and terrifying at the same time; if it works, it could <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> to where we've never been, protect us from what may be, but if it fails, it could kill us all." [...] Hip Hop DX reviewer B. Love wrote, [...] "This is Kool Keith's best album in years—arguably even better than his classic Octagonecologyst—and marks a fine return to form for one of rap music's most distinctive and original talents." ...|$|E
500|$|The premiere {{generally}} received mixed {{to negative}} feedback from television critics. Debbie Chang on BuddyTV deemed the episode [...] "dsyfunctional and ridiculous", being particularly {{critical of the}} story arc involving Stevens, whom she described as not being worthy of being promoted to the residency level. Chang expressed disagreement with the manner Bailey and Shepherd's characters were dealt with by the writers, feeling that the former's anger should have been targeted at herself, and criticizing the exaggerated exposure of the latter's [...] "first grader emotional maturity". However, Yang's character was praised, with Chang choosing her manner of repressing her feelings as a highlight. Chang expressed a general disappointment in the episode, disapproving the choice for the episode as a season opener, a topic in regard to which she elaborated, [...] "I [...] can see already that this season will continue to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> medical cases that are so blatantly about the doctors' pathetic lives." [...] In September 2009, {{the inclusion of the}} deer ranked twelfth in Entertainment Weekly [...] "Most Memorable Cases of Grey's Anatomy".|$|E

500|$|Spielberg and Janusz Kamiński, who {{has shot}} {{all of the}} director's films since 1993's Schindler's List, {{reviewed}} the previous films to study Douglas Slocombe's style. [...] "I didn’t want Janusz to modernize and <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> into the 21st century", Spielberg explained. [...] "I still wanted the film to have a lighting style not dissimilar to the work Doug Slocombe had achieved, which meant that both Janusz and I had to swallow our pride. Janusz had to approximate another cinematographer's look, and I had to approximate this younger director's look that I thought I had moved away from after almost two decades." [...] Spielberg also hired production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas after admiring his design work for Superman Returns. Spielberg {{did not want to}} fast cut action scenes, relying on his script instead for a fast pace, and had confirmed in 2002 that he would not shoot the film digitally, a format Lucas had adopted. Lucas felt [...] "it looks like it was shot three years after Last Crusade. The people, the look of it, everything. You’d never know there was 20 years between shooting." [...] Kamiński commented upon watching the three films back-to-back, he was amazed how each of them advanced technologically, but were all nevertheless consistent, neither too brightly or darkly lit.|$|E
500|$|Co-executive {{producer}} and staff writer Adam Horowitz stated that [...] "It's always interesting {{to pull back}} another layer {{on one of our}} characters, and to see another chapter in Juliet's story on the island and <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> to where she is now was great", while fellow co-executive {{producer and}} staff writer Edward Kitsis thought that [...] "the interesting thing about the episode is the way Ben looks at Juliet ... everything is informed by that look." [...] Horowitz also enjoyed the juxtaposition of Juliet's character development with the revelations on the [...] "freighter folk". [...] Kitsis picked the episode's final scene where Hugo [...] "Hurley" [...] Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and James [...] "Sawyer" [...] Ford (Josh Holloway) discover that Ben has negotiated his release and will be dining with them that evening as his favorite of the episode. [...] Actress Rebecca Mader, who plays Charlotte, said that she was [...] "so excited" [...] for the episode to air because she thought that it was [...] "even better" [...] than the previous episode, which is widely {{regarded as one of the}} best episodes of the series. [...] Charlotte knocks Kate unconscious with the barrel of her gun and asks [...] "what?" [...] to a speechless Daniel in [...] "The Other Woman". [...] Mader found this hilarious and described it as [...] "the pinnacle of [...] career".|$|E
500|$|On May 10, Giuliani held what The New York Times {{described}} as an [...] "extraordinary, emotional news conference" [...] in Bryant Park to announce that he was seeking a separation from Hanover, saying, [...] "This is very, very painful. For quite some time it's probably been apparent that Donna and I lead in many ways independent and separate lives." [...] Regarding Nathan, Giuliani said [...] "I'm going to need her now more than maybe I did before", making reference to his battle with cancer and her background in nursing. Regarding the senate race, he again did not commit to a decision, saying, [...] "I don't really care about politics right now. [...] I'm thinking about my family, the people that I love {{and what can be}} done that's honest and truthful and that protects them the best. [...] I'm not thinking about politics. Politics comes at least second, maybe third, maybe fourth, somewhere else. It'll all work itself out some way politically." [...] Giuliani had, however, neglected to inform Hanover in advance of his announcement; her reaction was {{described as}} distraught. [...] Three hours later, she held her own news conference at Gracie Mansion, where she said, [...] "Today's turn of events brings me great sadness. I had hoped to keep this marriage together. For several years, it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member." [...] In this, she was making reference to Cristyne Lategano, the former communications director for Giuliani; Vanity Fair had reported in 1997 that Lategano and Giuliani were having an affair, which both of them had denied. [...] Hanover continued, [...] "Beginning last May, I made a major effort to <b>bring</b> <b>us</b> back together. Rudy and I re-established some of our personal intimacy through the fall. At that point, he chose another path." ...|$|E
