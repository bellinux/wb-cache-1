5000|$|In {{a famous}} mix-up, issue 5 was {{originally}} released with the cover meant for issue 6. Besides bearing the wrong issue number, {{this meant that}} Freeman, credited on the cover, didn't actually appear in the initial release of that issue, and also made nonsense of the issue's letter column. Issue 5 was reprinted the following week with the correct cover (by Freeman) and the next month, issue 6 {{came out with a}} <b>blank</b> white <b>cover,</b> [...] "The Real No. 6" [...] where the issue number would normally appear, and a text piece on the inside cover explaining what had happened.

Another doubt arose in his mind however, as this one disappeared.

She could only hope that there would be inspiration in Mervyn's <b>blank</b> <b>cover,</b> and suppress her fever for suspense.|$|R

By return of post it went back under a <b>blank</b> <b>cover,</b> addressed to Alaric at the Weights and Measures. The days of duelling were gone by--unfortunately, as Norman now thought, but nothing, he determined, should ever induce him again to hold friendly intercourse with the traitor. He abstained from making any such oath as to the Woodwards; but determined that his conduct in that respect should be governed by the manner in which Alaric was received by them.|$|R

50|$|Atwater Afternoon was {{a limited}} edition CD {{released}} by the band American Music Club and initially sold on the tour to promote their album The Golden Age. Half {{of it was a}} recording of the band rehearsing songs for the tour and the other half was studio recordings of new songs. The initial run of 300 copies came with either <b>blank</b> <b>covers</b> or covers featuring pictures drawn by the band members. Once these had sold out, it was repressed in an edition of 1500 and sold from the band's web site. Two of the original songs on the album were written by members of the band other than Mark Eitzel. Neither has been released elsewhere. The name of the album relates to the area in Los Angeles where the recording took place.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} {{series of}} 23 Chip Hilton books {{has become a}} popular collectible, with the last few books fetching the highest prices because of their relatively limited print runs.

50|$|Boom was {{commissioned}} this book by American artist Sheila Hicks. The {{book was published}} in 2006 and gained a gold medal as ‘The Most Beautiful Book in the World’ at the Leipzig Book Fair. This book again troubled publishers for its <b>blank</b> <b>cover,</b> warning that an image is needed or it would not sell. Boom rejected a request to have the artists work on the cover stating that Hicks is an interesting artist who deserves a bigger audience, therefore {{is in need of}} a more abstract cover. The book was designed with a simple layout: text on the left, image centred on the right. Of particular note on this book are the edges, which are jagged and frayed. A circular hacksaw was introduced into the production process to create these edges, which mimicked the selvedges of Hick’s textile work. It measures at 22 x 15.5 x 5.6 cm and is part of the permanent collection at MoMA.|$|R
60|$|The {{manuscripts and}} letters were all {{returned}} in a <b>blank</b> <b>cover,</b> {{on the fourth}} of August, and here the intercourse was at an end. Gray and Mason were the friends whom Walpole had consulted about the manuscripts, and they had no hesitation in pronouncing them to be forgeries. It may seem strange, that with such men, the uncommon beauty of the poetry they contained did not create some interest for the author. But Gray was now in a state of health that, perhaps, left him little power of being interested in anything; or the wonder may resolve itself into that blindness which poets, no less than patrons, too frequently discover for the excellence of their contemporaries. Chatterton himself spoke with contempt of the productions of Collins. As to Walpole, he had no doubt more pleasure in petting the lap-dog that was left to his care by the old blind lady at Paris, than he could ever have felt in nursing the wayward genius of Chatterton.|$|R

40|$|In this work, a {{material}} model is presented that predicts the crash-relevant constitutive behavior of quench-hardenable boron steel 22 MnB 5 as function of material hardness. Three sets of sheets of 22 MnB 5 are heat treated such that their as-treated microstructures {{are close to}} fully martensitic, bainitic and ferritic/pearlitic, respectively. Hardness measurements show that the resulting <b>blanks</b> <b>cover</b> the full scope of possible hardness values, from 165 HV in the ferritic/pearlitic range to 477 HV in the fully hardened state. These three main grades provide the input data for a constitutive model consisting of an extended Swift hardening law and a strain-based fracture criterion. The hardening behavior of each grade is determined using standard tensile tests. For calibration of the fracture criterion, four different fracture samples are used. The developed model predicts the behavior of intermediate hardness grades by piecewise linear interpolation between the hardening and fracture models of the three calibrated grades. A newly developed tapered tensile test specimen is used to validate the model at hand...|$|R
60|$|And {{he was not}} the man to {{get through}} these things lightly, or with as much ease as he perhaps might conscientiously have done. He would pay for the defence of the prisoner; he would pay for the defence of his brother's memory; and he would pay for the poor girl's comforts. He would do this, and he would allow no one to help him. He stood alone in the world, and insisted on so standing. Old Mr Thorne of Ullathorne offered again to open his arms to him; but he had {{conceived}} a foolish idea that his cousin's severity had driven his brother on to his bad career, and he would consequently accept no kindness from Ullathorne. Miss Thorne, the old squire's daughter--a cousin considerably older than himself, to whom he had at one time been much attached--sent him money; and he returned it to her under a <b>blank</b> <b>cover.</b> He had still enough for those unhappy purposes which he had in hand. As to what might happen afterwards, he was then mainly indifferent.|$|R

40|$|In this article, a {{constitutive}} model for quench-hardenable boron steel is presented. Three sets of boron steel blanks are heat treated such that their as-treated microstructures {{are close to}} fully martensitic, bainitic and ferritic/pearlitic, respectively. Hardness measurements show that the resulting <b>blanks</b> <b>cover</b> the full scope of possible hardness values, from 165 HV in the ferritic/pearlitic range to 477 HV in the fully hardened state. These three main grades provide the input data for a {{constitutive model}} consisting of an extended Swift hardening law and a stress triaxiality and Lode angle dependent fracture criterion. The hardening behavior of each grade is determined using standard tensile tests at quasi-static strain rates. The strain-based fracture criterion is calibrated using four different flat fracture samples. The behavior of intermediate hardness grades is approximated by piecewise linear combination of the three calibrated constitutive models. A newly developed tapered tensile test specimen featuring a hardness transition zone in the gauge section is used to verify the model at hand. A four point bending test of a top hat section of intermediate hardness is used to verify the model for complex loading conditions...|$|R

Waverley's {{quarters}} {{had been assigned}} to him, by the Prince's express orders, in a handsome lodging, where there was accommodation for Colonel Talbot. His first business was to examine his portmanteau, and, after a very short search, out tumbled the expected packet. Waverley opened it eagerly. Under a <b>blank</b> <b>cover,</b> simply addressed to E. Waverley, Esq., he found a number of open letters. The uppermost were two from Colonel Gardiner addressed to himself. The earliest in date was a kind and gentle remonstrance for neglect of the writer's advice respecting the disposal of his time during his leave of absence, the renewal of which, he reminded Captain Waverley, would speedily expire. 'Indeed,' the letter proceeded, 'had it been otherwise, the news from abroad and my instructions from the War Office must have compelled me to recall it, as there is great danger, since the disaster in Flanders, both of foreign invasion and insurrection among the disaffected at home. I therefore entreat you will repair as soon as possible to the headquarters of the regiment; and I am concerned to add that this is still the more necessary as there is some discontent in your troop, and I postpone inquiry into particulars until I can have the advantage of your assistance.' ...|$|R
