According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you know when you have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E

500|$|The album {{version of}} [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] is 3 minutes 35 seconds long {{and is in}} the key of D major. The track begins with 43 seconds of the track [...] "By the Sea" [...] from Wendy & Bonnie's 1969 album Genesis {{featuring}} sparse fingerstyle guitar and female harmony vocals. The last syllable of the line [...] "...so hard to say goodbye" [...] is held and pans from left to right until [...] "Hello Sunshine" [...] itself begins with Gruff Rhys singing the title phrase, joined by the band on the second word. The first verse follows with simple piano and bass guitar backing Rhys's acoustic guitar to a basic 4/4 beat provided by drummer Dafydd Ieuan. The first chorus enters at 1 minute 13 seconds with Rhys being joined by falsetto harmony backing vocals on the lines [...] "In honesty it's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> since we had reason left to smile". The song breaks down for the bridge with just arpeggio guitar, simple bass and occasional drum rolls playing as the lines [...] "Hello sunshine, come into my life" [...] are sung.|$|E

Jesus Yanez-Reyes from Northern Arizona News gave [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] a very positive review and praised its lyrics and Shakira's [...] "heartfelt" [...] vocal delivery as having the ability [...] "to overcome whatever language barriers may exist between the artist and the listener, truly making it a song of note within the release." [...] Jennifer Schaffer from the Stanford Daily complimented the sensitivity of the song and commented that [...] "Shakira offers her listeners a far more vulnerable persona" [...] through it. Carlos Macias from Terra Music picked [...] "Antes de las Seis" [...] as his favourite track from the album and commended its lyrics, calling them [...] "classic Shakira" [...] and concluding that [...] "It'd <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> since the Colombian superstar offered us an insight into her heart."

500|$|... "Break the Ice" [...] is an electro-R {{song with}} {{influences}} of the rave scene and crunk. It is {{performed in a}} moderate pop groove. The song is composed in the key of F minor and is set in time signature of common time with a tempo of 120 beats per minute. According to Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Break the Ice" [...] sounds similar to Nelly Furtado's [...] "Say It Right" [...] (2006). It opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> / I know I shouldn't keep you waiting / But I'm here now", which serve as an apology for being gone so long from the music industry as well as away from her love interest in the song. After the first line, Spears sings over a choir. According to Chuck Arnold of People, Spears delivers her [...] "trademark breathy vocals". In the first verse, synthesizers kick in and run {{until the end of}} the second chorus. After it, Spears stops the song and sings [...] "I like this part / It feels kind of good", mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The music changes, as described by Tom Ewing of Pitchfork Media, to [...] " [...] sounds like spacehoppers [...] bouncing in slow motion round a padded cell". The song is constructed in the common verse-chorus form. Lyrically, the song is about two people, in which one of them asks the other to get to know each other and [...]|$|E

500|$|The fourth {{song and}} third single [...] "Break the Ice" [...] opens with Spears singing the lines [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> / I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting / But I'm here now". The song {{features}} a choir and Keri Hilson singing background vocals sounding {{almost like a}} duet.

Let me warm things up and [...]'" [...] After the chorus, the bridge begins with Spears saying [...] "I like this part" [...] mimicking Janet Jackson in [...] "Nasty" [...] (1986). The album's fifth track, [...] "Heaven on Earth", is a Euro disco love song with new wave influences. It is inspired by Donna Summer's [...] "I Feel Love" [...] (1977), with three vocal lines taking place over the beat. Nicole Morier commented that the song was written from a very dark place, saying, [...] "I was thinking of someone and thinking they were so perfect and that I have all these imperfections. [...] I think what's touching {{about it is that}} it's from the perspective of someone who feels like they really need this person just to feel safe and feel good." [...] Spears named the song her favorite from Blackout. The sixth track, [...] "Get Naked (I Got a Plan)" [...] is an uptempo R song about sex. It is a duet between Spears and Danja, who sings the chorus with his voice distorted to sound like a decaying moan. Spears contributes a series of gasps, sighs and chants and her voice is also distorted.|$|E
500|$|Erik Adams of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a {{moderately}} positive review and awarded it a [...] "B".

While feeling {{that some of the}} episode's subplots were [...] "forced", he did, however, compliment the Pam and Nellie pairing due to [...] "Pam's past ability to break through [...] Angela and Dwight's defenses". Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine noted that, despite Andy's regression to [...] "his old ways", it was beneficial for the episode and allowed for many jokes to be played out. Furthermore, Stiernberg applauded the subtle drama that ran throughout the entry, writing Darryl, Erin, and Pete's interactions with Andy were important to the overall storyline. Mark Trammell of TV Equals named it [...] "the best episode of the final season of The Office to date" [...] because it [...] "played to the show's strengths". Furthermore, he complimented the character development of Nellie, writing that she [...] "really started to grow on me this week" [...] and that his favorite line was Darryl's [...] "words of wisdom" [...] to Jim: [...] "It's not real until your wife is on board." [...] Michael Tedder of New York magazine gave the episode a positive review and noted that [...] "It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> since The Office was this surprising and moving." [...] He wrote that the main plot allowed for [...] "overdue development" [...] in regards to other characters and applauded the continued drama involving Pam and Jim; he called the last shot [...] "quietly heartbreaking".

2500|$|Before making The Shining, Stanley Kubrick had {{directed}} the 1975 movie Barry Lyndon, a highly visual period film about an Irish man who {{attempts to make}} his way into the British aristocracy. Despite its technical achievements, the film was not a box office success in the United States and was derided by critics for being too long and too slow.

I am so excited about returning and seeing what the future holds for her. [...] It's <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> since I set foot in Albert Square and I am looking forward to coming home." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins added: [...] "Stacey is one of EastEnders best-loved characters, played by one of television's finest actors, and I am tremendously excited that Lacey has decided to return home to Walford. Stacey's last time on the Square was iconic. But that was just the first act. There is so much more to come for Stacey—and her return will send ripples of drama through the Square." [...] Stacey confesses to the murder of Archie Mitchell. Lacey Turner took a break to film the new series of Our Girl.

2500|$|Jeta Amata, {{who grew}} up in the Niger Delta stated in an {{interview}} that it has <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> since he has wanted to make a film on the Niger Delta. He had written three scripts on it for about eight years; but as the issues kept escalating, it seemed more difficult to make [...] "but I got to the point where I knew it just has to be now". [...] Black November is fiction based on an actual event, the title being derived from the month in which activist Ken Saro-Wiwa was executed in 1995. Amata had once met Saro-Wiwa through his father and was affected by his death. The recent Niger Delta militancy further triggered Amata's interest to make the film; Jeta Amata had to meet with most of the Niger Delta ex-militants such as Asari Dokubo and Boyloaf to listen to their sides of the story. He stated in an interview: [...] "What I'm doing is what they did, but without weapons." [...] Amata explained that even though the film touched some political points, he is more concerned about the human parts of the story, about the feelings of the people and what they passed through: [...] "We are not trying to fight the government, trying to fight the oil companies, no -- we are trying to repair what has been damaged". [...] The film was majorly funded by a Nigerian business magnate, Captain Hosa Wells Okunbo, who says he does not want to go down in history as [...] "just another rich merchant", he wants to give something back to the region that made him wealthy.|$|E
