40|$|During {{the past}} three years, the {{mechanical}} testing of solid propellants, solid rocket grains, and solid rocket motors under idealized conditions has been receiving increased attention. Today {{it is not uncommon}} to see a multitude of new techniques and analyses being investigated. One may expect to see dummy propellant prepared with glass <b>bead</b> <b>filler</b> to observe its dilatation to rupture; to ink circles, rectangular g rids at various critical areas on a grain surface, and to observe the distortion of these grids as a result of thermal cycling and/or slump; to subj e ct rectangular parallel-opipedal-shaped specimens to both torsion and biaxial tension as well as hydrostatic compression and parallel-plate tension; to apply theories of large elastic strain, and non-linear viscoelasticity; to search for an isotropic failure criterion as well as a crack propagation criterion. In short the mechanics of propellant behavior from small deformation all the way to fracture initiation and propagation has become quite sophisticated. Gradually the results of this testing and their thinking are being integrated in a logical scheme of analysis which is being passed along to the engineer and being used in predicting performance of rocket motors. This particular program will pertain to four areas: 1) The characterization of polyurethane propellant behavior out to fracture initiation in terms of large strain theory. 2) The development of a failure criterion and crack propagation criteria for said materials. 3) The generation, where possible, of macroscopic mechanical parameters in terms of molecular parameters. 4 The solution of certain stress problems, in both linear and non-linear theory, which are prerequisite to engineering applications. As such it is part of a continuing research study of structural integrity problems in solid propellant rocket motors being conducted under the general direction of Dr. M. L. Williams in the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory. This preliminary report is intended as an interim working document to be circulated for the purpose of stimulating discussion...|$|E
40|$|The {{dramatic}} increase of Improvised Explosive Device (IED) related injuries has stimulated many studies {{to reconsider the}} design of the current state-of-the-art vehicle and body protective equipment. Materials now need to be chosen not only to stop solid projectiles such as shrapnel or bullets but also to attenuate the injurious effects of incoming blast waves. New advanced computational models of such events have been proved to facilitate the access to information currently inaccessible to experiments. To this end, we developed a fluid-structure interaction computational continuum model to investigate the attenuation properties of foam specimens containing filler materials under shock loading. Three test specimens were examined: a solid foam sample, and two other foam samples incorporating an intermediate layer of filler material: SiO 2 aerogel and soda-lime glass beads. The model was then calibrated and the results compared to the corresponding shock tube experimental results [M. D. Alley, S. F. Son, G. Christou, R. Goel, L. Young, 2009]. In conclusion, the model shows good agreement with experiment values for the peak pressure of the transmitted wave as well as its propagation time. Complementing the existing experimental results, high density soda-lime glass <b>beads</b> <b>filler</b> material is shown to substantially decrease the peak magnitude of the transmitted wave and to decrease the spatial gradient of the pressure compared to the other lower density filler samples. However, the history of the sample reaction force suggests that the frame constraining the test specimen is being subjected to a higher impulse using the high density filler. Such a model paves the road to a new series of complex numerical models designed to accompany experimental testing by providing new insights on the mechanisms of fluid-structure interaction. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

As {{a result of}} this series of tests and experiments, it was 	found that, with filling glass beads by 30 wt. %, abrasion quantity 	of the composite material falls to 1 / 4 of that of unsaturated 	polyester resin, and abrasion resistance is improved remarkably. 	By filling glass beads, tensile and bending strength, elongation 	and deflection become smaller. In terms of elastic modulus, the 	composite material has tendency to show increase in dry condition, 	while to show decrease in wet condition.

40|$|Abstract. Among the {{different}} surface treatments {{used to improve}} the wear resistance of metallic materials, plasma transferred arc (PTA) is an attractive alternative to conventional techniques due to the intrinsic properties of its higher deposition rate, lower heat input and especially for the wide applicability of materials. The wide range of materials {{makes it possible to}} produce metallurgical bonding between the hardfacing layer and substrate material with very low dilution and distortion. Weld deposits are characterized by less level of inclusions, oxides, discontinuities and wear resistance. Metal-mechanic industry continuously requires recovering tool steel components subjected to severe wear. In this research Fe-based filler metal was deposited on D 2 steel by using plasma transferred arc (PTA) process. The influence of Cr and Nb on Fe-based filler metal microstructure was investigated using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). In order to evaluate the mechanical properties were performed wear and hardness tests. The wear resistance and hardness values were compared with the results of a weld <b>bead</b> using nickel-based <b>filler</b> metal...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{its high}} {{deposition}} rate, low cost and simple setup, weld-deposition based additive manufacturing is slowly evolving into {{a viable alternative}} for creating meso-scale applications. There is also an increasing demand for creating functionally gradient objects with varying properties. Gas metal arc welding based twin-wire weld-deposition presented here {{makes it possible to}} create functionally gradient objects with varying mechanical properties like hardness. This is achieved by using separate filler wires of different composition and controlling the proportion of each wire separately. The current work presents a proof of concept of the twin-wire weld-deposition and also the primary experiments carried out for understanding the effect of weld-deposition process parameter on <b>bead</b> geometry. Two <b>filler</b> wires viz., ER 70 S- 6 and ER 110 S-G, the former having lower hardness than the latter, were used for the experimentation. The range of process parameter for different combinations of these filler wires was determined and the operating range of the same was identified. Subsequently, the criterion for adapting the twin-wire welding from joining to weld-deposition of a complete layer like thermal steady-state condition, effect of torch direction and effect of overlapping beads have also been studied...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{experimental}} {{study was to investigate}} the influence of brazing and laser welding on the shear-bond strength of metal-ceramic alloys. According to DIN EN ISO  9693,  189 patterns were cast in the non-precious alloys Wirobond® 280, Wirobond® LFC, and Wirocer® plus, veneered with Omega 900 ® or Response® ceramics, yielding eight groups with seven specimens each. The unveneered frameworks of the first three groups were not divided and joined: serving as a control, a non-blasted, and a non-milled group. In the next three groups the frameworks were divided and brazed: according to the manufacturer’s instructions, application of the brazing material all-over the area to be veneered with flux contamination, and without contamination. In the last three groups the frameworks were divided and laser-welded: according to the manufacturer’s instructions, leaving a welding <b>bead,</b> and welding <b>filler</b> material application all-over the area to be veneered. Ceramic veneering was performed after the joining procedures. The specimens were subjected to SCHWICKERATH's 3 -point flexural test. Selected samples were investigated under the microscope for residual ceramics on the surface and for irregularities in the metal-ceramic interface from a lateral view. Almost all groups revealed no significant influence on the bond strength by the simulated joining procedures. As for the brazed groups, contamination with flux did not lower the bond strength, maybe caused by the test set-up or by how these samples were contaminated. The bond strength was not lowered either by all-over application of brazing material under the veneered surface. Since brazing materials and parent metals show differences both in modulus of elasticity and thermal expansion, the selected combination of materials was beneficial for the bond. Laser welding of the frame works did not result in different bond strengths, except for the all-over application of a welding filler material with an unsuitable thermal expansion coefficient. Most non-blasted samples had significantly lower values of bond strength. The investigation of the fracture surfaces showed mostly mixed adhesive-cohesive failures. Adhesive failures were observed on non-blasted samples. The contaminated groups exhibited residual ceramics infiltrated with flux. As for the joined groups there were no altered fracture lines or irregularities in the metal-ceramic interface observed from a lateral view except for the flux. No general correlation can be declared for the joined groups regarding the residual ceramics or fracture lines and the levels of bond strength...|$|R
