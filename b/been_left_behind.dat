Helicopters overflew the designated LZs to check no Americans had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> and then the last helicopters (many low on fuel) headed out to TF76, located the USS Midway or the USS Hancock and shut down. All Air America flights had ceased by 21:00. With its available fleet of only 20 Hueys (3 of which were impounded, ditched or damaged at TF76), Air America had moved over 1,000 evacuees to the DAO Compound, the Embassy or out to the ships of TF76.|$|E
5|$|In September, Sitting Bull {{and about}} one hundred Hunkpapa Lakota {{encountered}} a small party near {{what is now}} Marmarth, North Dakota. They had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> by a wagon train commanded by Captain James L. Fisk to effect some repairs to an overturned wagon. When he led an attack, Sitting Bull {{was shot in the}} left hip by a soldier. The bullet exited out through the small of his back, and the wound was not serious.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, six Beauforts of No. 100 Squadron RAAF {{had arrived}} at Milne Bay on 5 September. An {{additional}} three Beaufighters of No. 30 Squadron RAAF, the first to operate this aircraft, joined them the following day. The Beauforts were tasked with providing additional support against further landings and undertaking anti-shipping missions. On 6 September, the Allied offensive reached the main camp of the Japanese landing force, fighting a number of minor actions against small groups that had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> after the evacuation.|$|E

5|$|When the British and Arab forces {{marched on}} Damascus {{in the final}} year of the Sinai and Palestine Campaign in World War I, the Ottoman {{authorities}} fled and left Damascus in the control of a committee of citizens. The newly appointed Ottoman military governor released 4,000 prisoners from the citadel, who subsequently started pillaging and killing sick and disabled Ottoman soldiers who had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in the city. These riots only stopped with the entrance into the city of the Australian Light Horse troops on 1 October 1918.|$|E
5|$|When the RUC {{arrived at}} the site they found five dead bodies, a seriously injured Stephen Travers, body parts, the {{smouldering}} remains of the destroyed minibus, debris from the bomb blast, bullets, spent cartridges, and the band members' personal possessions, including clothing, shoes, and {{a photograph of the}} group, strewn across the area. They also discovered a stolen white Ford Escort registration number 4933 LZ, which had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> by the gunmen, along with two guns, ammunition, green UDR berets and a pair of glasses later traced to James McDowell, the gunman who had ordered the shootings.|$|E
5|$|General Grant had Commander Henry Walke {{bring the}} Carondelet up the Cumberland River {{to create a}} {{diversion}} by opening fire on the fort. The Confederates responded with shots from their long-range guns and eventually hit the gunboat. Walke retreated several miles below the fort, but soon returned and continued shelling the water batteries. General McClernand, in the meantime, had been attempting to stretch his men toward the river but ran into difficulties with a Confederate battery of guns. McClernand ultimately decided {{that he did not}} have enough men to stretch all the way to the river, so Grant decided to call on more troops. He sent orders to General Wallace, who had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> at Fort Henry, to bring his men to Fort Donelson.|$|E

5|$|Macrinus {{had several}} {{issues that he}} needed to deal with {{at the time of his}} accession, which had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> by his predecessor. As Caracalla had a {{tendency}} towards military belligerence, rather than diplomacy, this left several conflicts for Macrinus to resolve. Additionally, Caracalla had been a profligate spender of Rome's income. Most of the money was spent on the army; he had greatly increased their pay from 2,000 sesterces to 3,000 sesterces per year. The increased expenditures forced Caracalla to strip bare whatever sources of income he had to supply the difference. This shortfall left Rome in a dire fiscal situation that Macrinus needed to address.|$|E
5|$|The British army {{began an}} unopposed landing {{at the north}} end of Lake George on the morning of July 6. Abercrombie first landed an advance force to check the area where the forces were to disembark, and found it {{recently}} deserted; some supplies and equipment had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> by the French in their hasty departure. The bulk of the army landed, formed into columns, and attempted to march up the west side of the stream that connected Lake George to Lake Champlain, rather than along the portage trail, whose bridges Montcalm had destroyed. However, the wood was very thick, and the columns could not be maintained.|$|E
5|$|The {{battalion}} was reformed at Baggush {{from those}} who had escaped capture at Sidi Rezegh (about 300-odd) and other personnel who had {{been left out of}} battle, along with replacements from New Zealand. The battalion's second-in-command, Major C.D.A. George, who had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> at Baggush when the New Zealanders moved into Libya, was promoted to lieutenant colonel and became its commander. The battalion was stationed at Baggush until late January 1942 before being moved to Maadi. Shortly afterwards it was called into Cairo for four days to increase the Allied presence there and counter potential unrest amongst the civilian population of the city. Once tensions decreased it returned to Maadi, and resumed training and this included practice in amphibious operations.|$|E

5|$|The brigade {{was widely}} {{dispersed}} following its {{arrival in the}} Brunei Bay area. In June 1945, the brigade headquarters and the 366th and 367th Independent Infantry Battalions were stationed in Brunei. The 368th Independent Infantry Battalion was located at the inland town of Beaufort, and the 371st Independent Infantry Battalion formed {{the main body of}} the island of Labuan's garrison. Of the support units, the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade Artillery Unit was at Brunei and the 56th Independent Mixed Brigade Engineer and Signal Units were at Beaufort. All of the brigade's heavy weapons had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> at Tawau, and due to the casualties incurred during the march across Borneo its combat units were not fit for battle.|$|E
5|$|With {{the end of}} the Battle of France and the {{evacuation}} of the British Expeditionary Force from the port of Dunkirk between 26 May and 4 June 1940, a German invasion of Great Britain seemed likely. However, the British Army was not well-equipped to defend the country in such an event; in the weeks after the Dunkirk evacuation it could only field twenty-seven divisions. The Army was particularly short of anti-tank guns, 840 of which had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in France, and only 167 were available in Britain; ammunition was so scarce for the remaining guns that regulations forbade even a single round being used for training purposes.|$|E

With all flights canceled due to a snowstorm, Christian and Aaron spend an intimate night in a motel. When Christian awakes, he finds Aaron gone. Aaron's pocket watch, a family heirloom, has <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind.</b> Christian returns to Los Angeles. In Idaho, Aaron is excommunicated by the church elders, led by his own father, Farron, who is the stake president. Aaron is rejected by his father and scolded by his mother, who tells him {{that he needs to}} pray for forgiveness. When Aaron suggests that he might be gay, his mother slaps him. Overwhelmed by despair, Aaron attempts suicide. He is subsequently sent by his parents to a treatment facility to be cured of his homosexuality.|$|E

5|$|George II's {{relationship}} with his son and heir apparent, Frederick, Prince of Wales, worsened during the 1730s. Frederick had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in Germany when his parents came to England, and they had not met for 14 years. In 1728, he was brought to England, and swiftly became a figurehead of the political opposition. When George visited Hanover in the summers of 1729, 1732 and 1735, he left his wife to chair the regency council in Britain rather than his son. Meanwhile, rivalry between George II and his brother-in-law and first cousin Frederick William I of Prussia led to tension along the Prussian–Hanoverian border, which eventually culminated in the mobilization of troops in the border zone and suggestions of a duel between the two kings. Negotiations for a marriage between the Prince of Wales and Frederick William's daughter Wilhelmine dragged on for years but neither side would make the concessions demanded by the other, and the idea was shelved. Instead, the prince married Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha in April 1736.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a {{detachment}} of about 100 {{men from the}} battalion, who had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in Australia when it deployed to Singapore, also {{took part in the}} fighting on Java. After a brief campaign, the majority of these personnel were taken into captivity when the Allied forces were overwhelmed around Buitenzorg in mid-March 1942, although some attempted to fight on as guerillas. Eventually these men were either killed or captured; prisoners remained in Japanese captivity {{until the end of the}} war in August 1945. During the three-and-a-half years they were held by the Japanese, members of the 2/4th were sent to prison camps around the Pacific, where they were used as slave labour and subjected to harsh conditions and extreme brutality. After the war, the surviving members of the battalion were returned to Australia but the 2/4th was not re-raised.|$|E
5|$|Other Marines {{who have}} also <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> {{team up with}} Shephard and attempt to reach another {{extraction}} point near Black Mesa's Lambda Complex, but en route they come under attack from black operations units seeking to thoroughly contain the situation and eliminate all survivors. Shephard {{makes it to the}} Lambda Complex alive, and briefly sees Gordon Freeman as the latter teleports to Xen {{in the final stages of}} Half-Life. To escape the teleportation chamber, Shephard is forced to enter a separate portal, briefly taking him to Xen before depositing him in an entirely different area of the facility. The facility is now heavily damaged, and it soon becomes clear that a new alien race, Race X, has exploited the situation to mount a localized invasion, attacking both human and Xen forces in Black Mesa indiscriminately. Fighting between the black operations units and Race X quickly intensifies.|$|E

5|$|When a {{hurricane}} arrives at Langley Falls, the Smiths prepare to evacuate their {{home with their}} neighbor Buckle in his amphibious raft. Stan, however, recommends that the family stay home during the storm, believing {{it is the best}} way for everyone to be safe. Hayley and Jeff also wish to stay to help the animals that have <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in the zoo. Francine disagrees with Stan's notion, Steve and Roger supporting her, as she points out Stan's history with making terrible decisions during crisis situations. But before the debate can be resolved, the seawall breaks and the ocean floods down the street, removing Buckle and his raft out of its path and trapping the Smiths in their home nevertheless. The neighborhood is now flooded, and while the smiths thinks it's too late to escape, the house is drifting along the floodwater's current. In an attempt to save the family from floating into any potential dangerous areas, Stan anchors the home; however the anchoring system also acts as a hinge and rotates the house upside-down, partially submerging it underwater.|$|E
5|$|When the U.S. 7th Cavalry {{accepted}} {{the surrender of}} Chief Joseph and the remaining Nez Perce, they immediately took more than 1,000 of the tribe's horses, sold what they could and shot many of the rest. But a significant population of horses had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind</b> in the Wallowa valley when the Nez Perce began their retreat, and additional animals escaped or were abandoned along the way. The Nez Perce were ultimately settled on reservation lands in north central Idaho, were allowed few horses, and were required by the Army to crossbreed to draft horses {{in an attempt to}} create farm horses. The Nez Perce tribe never regained its former position as breeders of Appaloosas. In the late 20th century, they began a program to develop a new horse breed, the Nez Perce horse, with the intent to resurrect their horse culture, tradition of selective breeding, and horsemanship.|$|E
5|$|After a brief stay in Sydney {{where the}} battalion's {{equipment}} deficiencies were made good and some reinforcements were received from local recruit training depots, they embarked again on 10 January in company with HMAS Canberra, and proceeded through the Bass Strait. As {{they were under}} way, the troops were kept occupied with training on the Bren light machine gun and the Thompson sub-machine gun, quantities of which were hastily added to the battalion's equipment scale. They reached Fremantle, Western Australia, on 15 January and overnight, {{a large number of}} 2/4th men defied orders to stay aboard ship and went ashore to spend time with their families; when the Aquitania sailed the next day, 94 men were left behind. The situation in Malaya was grave as the Japanese were steadily pushing the British and Commonwealth defenders south down the peninsula and as the gravity of the situation dawned upon the Australian government, a knee-jerk reaction saw the dispatch of 150 partially trained reinforcements from Northam. They arrived just as the Aquitania departed, being ferried out to Rottnest Island where they joined the ship's company late in the afternoon of 16 January. Although the reinforcements made good the men that had <b>been</b> <b>left</b> <b>behind,</b> they were only partially trained and ill-prepared for the fighting that would follow.|$|E
