25|$|The very-high {{temperature}} of lightning naturally produces {{small amounts of}} NOx, NH3, and HNO3, but high-temperature combustion has contributed to a 6 or 7 fold increase in the flux of NOx to the atmosphere. Its production {{is a function of}} combustion temperature - the higher the temperature, the more NOx is produced. Fossil fuel combustion is a primary contributor, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> biofuels and even the burning of hydrogen. The higher combustion {{temperature of}} hydrogen produces more NOx than natural gas combustion.|$|E
50|$|Seizures <b>are</b> a consequence, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> {{excessive}} laughter, {{which is}} a major hindrance to early diagnosis.|$|R
50|$|Response {{to initial}} therapy <b>is</b> common, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> relapse (25% to 50%) and/or prolonged, {{moderate}} discomfort (40%).|$|R

500|$|According to Benson {{the main}} theme of Diamonds Are Forever is {{expressed}} in the title, with the permanency of the gemstones held in contrast to {{other aspects of the}} story, particularly love and life. Towards {{the end of the novel}} Fleming uses the lines [...] "Death is forever. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> diamonds", and Benson sees the gems as a metaphor for death and Bond as the [...] "messenger of death".|$|E
2500|$|Inhumation {{practices}} are mixed. Flat graves are found <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> substantial kurgan burials, {{the latter of}} which may be surrounded by s. This points to a heterogeneous ethno-linguistic population (see section below).|$|E
2500|$|Stalin Prize for {{the year}} 1949, {{announced}} in March 1950, showed {{a clear and present}} division of Stalinist architecture – extravagant, expensive buildings are still praised, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> attempts to make Stalinist style affordable. The 1949 prize was given exclusively for completed apartment buildings, a sign of priority. It also demonstrates class stratification of eligible tenants of this time. Three Moscow buildings received awards: ...|$|E

2500|$|A Council of Senior Scholars, {{appointed}} {{and paid}} by the government advises the king on religious matters. [...] The ulema have also been a key influence in major government decisions, have {{a significant role in}} the judicial and education systems and a monopoly of authority in the sphere of religious and social morals. [...] Not only is the succession to the throne subject to the approval of the ulema, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> all new laws (royal decrees).|$|E
2500|$|Stigmata High-Five {{represents}} the latest musical {{style of the}} band. The grindcore and death metal elements are still present, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> more progressive and experimental ideas mixed with metalcore elements. The album contains longer songs with more intricate riffs and atypical time signatures. For example, the opening song [...] "La Dernière Image" [...] moves from groove-oriented grindcore based around a repeating clave rhythm with odd meters interspersed throughout (the clave rhythm and odd meters are both basic musical features of much progressive rock). A middle section counters that with more ambient textures and clean guitars.|$|E
6000|$|... "One word," [...] {{said the}} lawyer. [...] "Carew was my client, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> you, and I {{want to know}} what I am doing. You have not been mad enough to hide this fellow?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Noah {{admits the}} {{evidence}} of this correlation is [...] "circumstantial rather than direct", <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> [...] "the evidence that smoking is {{a leading cause of}} lung cancer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your pardon, master," [...] said Martin. [...] "I {{know it was}} careless; {{my mother}} always told me that I <b>was</b> careless, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>was</b> my father before me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. He {{strikes me}} as a bit of an adventurer, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> the rest of them, and he's none the worse for that. Trying to get ahead of dago {{politicians}} is a risky job." ...|$|E
6000|$|He chuckled. [...] "Sister, you can't {{get away}} with it. I'm onto you. You {{consider}} me a big bluff. Well, maybe I am. <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> you, my dear--and pretty enough so that I'd try {{to make love to}} you, if I weren't afraid you'd slap me." ...|$|E
60|$|My dear friends, {{this may}} seem deep and a mystery: <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> all things in this wondrous life of ours. And surely we see a pattern of all this in our own lives. Each child is educated--or ought to be-- as Christ educated his apostles.|$|E
6000|$|Answ. 3. Our consciences {{naturally}} are evil, [...] "having (saith the scripture) {{our hearts}} sprinkled from an evil conscience" [...] (Heb 10:22). <b>But</b> <b>so</b> <b>is</b> not the Spirit of Christ.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't deny {{but they}} are, sometimes, both gross and cruel, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> civilized men. The scalp-dance no more {{represents}} them than a bayonet charge represents us. It isn't just to condemn {{all for the}} faults of a few. You wouldn't destroy servant-girls because {{some of them are}} ugly and untidy, would you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Chatter!" [...] he {{repeated}} angrily. [...] "Ah, but there. You Scotch people are strange men. Your face is hard and your words rough, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> {{those of the}} good fishermen with whom I stay, yet I find that beneath it all there lie kind honest natures.

6000|$|... "Going strong when I left her. The Roman Catholic Missions are {{adopting}} the unclaimed babies {{to turn them}} into little priests; the Basil Mission is taking some, and the mothers are taking the rest. You should hear the little beggars howl when they're sent away from William. She's pulled down a bit, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> we all. Now, when do you suppose you'll be able to move?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Each {{class was}} given a letter or number but these were not very meaningful. For example, [...] "700" [...] Class {{locomotives}} <b>were</b> 0-6-0s, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>were</b> [...] "Q" [...] Class engines. See: ...|$|R

60|$|A {{relation}} {{is said to}} be transitive, if, {{whenever it}} holds between A and B and also between B and C, it holds between A and C. Thus before, after, greater, above are transitive. All relations giving rise to series are transitive, <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> many others. The transitive relations just mentioned were asymmetrical, but many transitive relations are symmetrical--for instance, equality in any respect, exact identity of colour, being equally numerous (as applied to collections), and so on.|$|E

'About half an {{hour after}} the young farmer awoke, and looking across the room saw that his friend Georgy had gone away in clothes which didn't belong to him, and had kindly left for himself the seedy ones worn by Georgy.

6000|$|Thus, still {{confining}} {{ourselves to}} the American continent, we have the ancient hymns of the Zuñis, in no way Christianised, and never chanted {{in the presence of}} the Mexican Spanish, These hymns run thus: 'Before the beginning of the New Making, Awonawilona, the Maker and container of All, the All-Father, solely had being.' He then evolved all things 'by thinking himself outward in space.' Hegelian! <b>but</b> <b>so</b> <b>are</b> the dateless hymns of the Maoris, despite the savage mythology which intrudes into both sets of traditions.
