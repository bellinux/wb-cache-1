Within a few years the market was entirely publicly owned, and the council took responsibility for the upkeep of the market. The city also bought out and closed many of the 30 or more inns in the area, transferring their licences to the growing suburbs.|$|E

25|$|Until February 2005, Canopy held SCO shares, and the {{management}} of SCO held shares of Canopy. The two parties became embroiled in a bitter dispute when the Noorda family sought to oust board member Ralph Yarro III on claims of misappropriation.

25|$|The {{scale of}} {{destruction}} and devastation was unprecedented: treasures, art collections, scrolls from the imperial library and human lives were lost {{on a scale}} that the Chinese had never seen before. Due to the heavy damage to the country's economy and military, and the loss of talented manpower, the Southern Song dynasty did not recover the lost territories, despite constant fighting between the Song and Jin, the territory was ruled by non-Han Chinese emperors. It would take another 200 years, until the Ming dynasty, to claim <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> territories that the Song dynasty lost.|$|E
25|$|Andrew Jackson's grandson, Andrew Jackson III, and {{his family}} were the last to occupy the Hermitage. The family moved out in 1893 when it ceased being a family residence. The Hermitage was opened to the public by the Ladies' Hermitage Association, who had been deeded the {{property}} by the State of Tennessee, as a museum of both Jackson's life and the antebellum South in general. The Association restored the mansion to its appearance in 1837. Over time it bought <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> land that had been sold, taking ownership of the last parcel in 2003 to restore the plantation boundaries.|$|E

25|$|In 1981, DuPont {{acquired}} Conoco Inc., a major American {{oil and gas}} producing {{company that}} gave it a secure source of petroleum feedstocks needed for the manufacturing of many of its fiber and plastics products. The acquisition, which made DuPont {{one of the top}} ten U.S.-based petroleum and natural gas producers and refiners, came about after a bidding war with the giant distillery Seagram Company Ltd., which would become DuPont's largest single shareholder with four seats on the board of directors. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Seagram Chief Executive Officer Edgar Bronfman Jr., DuPont announced a deal in which the company would buy <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> shares owned by Seagram.|$|E
25|$|Rocky RoadRunner is the mascot of the RoadRunners. Rocky, who {{has been}} with the team for decades, is a {{mainstay}} from the early years in the desert. His service dates <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to 1967. The ECHL team brought a major change of the entire costume, most notably the skin, which turned a bright yellow compared to a shade of brown in previous years. Furthermore, rather than continuing the more lifelike version of previous years, the ECHL's version chose to make a more cartoonish version of Rocky. The 2007–08 ECHL Season coincided with Rocky's 40th year of service, which was by far the oldest mascot in the history of any pro sports team in Arizona.|$|E
25|$|Foreign leaders {{reacted with}} both {{positive}} and mixed messages. Most world leaders congratulated and praised Barack Obama on his re-election victory. However, Venezuela and some other states had tempered reactions. Pakistan commented that Romney's defeat had made Pakistan-United States relations safer. Stock markets fell noticeably after Obama's re-election, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ, and the S 500 each declining over two percent {{the day after the}} election. By his inauguration, however, the markets had gained <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> losses and a bull run began that culminated in 2015 when the Dow closed at an all-time high of 18,312, the NASDAQ reached the milestone of 5,210, and the S 500 peaked at a record 2,130.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of February 2, 2014, just after 7:30a.m., the steel support cables that {{stretched}} from end-to-end of stadium that held together the roof were severed, as construction crews set off a simultaneous set of 42 explosive charges that detached the cables from the concrete structure. The general public was not informed about {{this phase of the}} demolition process, prompting about a half-dozen phone calls to police from people who wondered what was going on. This was viewed as the final step before the destruction of the concrete bowl of the Metrodome would begin. On February 10, 2014, shortly after 9:15a.m., after more than two months of preliminary work that dated <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the groundbreaking of the new Vikings stadium, demolition of the stadium walls finally began.|$|E
25|$|After Elvis's {{death in}} 1977, Priscilla acted as {{executor}} for his only heir, their daughter, Lisa Marie (who was then only 9). Graceland itself cost $500,000 {{a year in}} upkeep, and expenses had dwindled Lisa Marie's inheritance to only $1 million. Taxes due on the property and other expenses due came to over $500,000. Faced with having to sell Graceland, Priscilla examined other famous homes/museums. She hired a CEO, Jack Soden, to turn Graceland into a tourist attraction. Graceland was {{opened to the public}} on June 7, 1982. Presley's gamble paid off; only four weeks after opening Graceland's doors, the estate made <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> money it had invested. Priscilla became the chairwoman and president of Elvis Presley Enterprises (EPE), stating she would remain in the position until Lisa Marie reached 21 years of age. Under Presley's guidance, the enterprise's fortunes soared and eventually the trust grew to be worth over $100 million.|$|E
25|$|With the {{consistent}} success of Ultimate's releases there were rumours of a buyout by Ocean, {{until it was}} announced in 1985 that the Stamper brothers had sold the Ultimate catalogue and name to U.S. Gold, who would continue to release games under the Ultimate label. Later titles such as Martianoids and Bubbler were not seen by the gaming press as being up to Ultimate's previously high standards and sales fell. U.S. Gold released no new Ultimate games after Bubbler in 1987. A final Sabreman game, Mire Mare, was trailed in earlier Sabreman games and was mentioned by Sinclair User as being next up for release, but was quietly dropped during development. In late 1988 Rare bought <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> rights sold to U.S. Gold and were reported to be developing games again. Future releases were to have included Solar Jetman, which would eventually appear only on the Nintendo Entertainment System, although home computer conversions for the Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, and Atari ST were completed by Storm Software, but not released.|$|E

25|$|But then {{a mysterious}} {{person in a}} Krabby Patty-costume defeats {{all four of the}} {{restaurant}} managers, saves SpongeBob and takes him back to the Krusty Krab. It turns out that the Krusty Krab has gone downhill ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume, and explains that as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again, with Mr. Krabs admitting that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook, and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs reveals that he has installed a pay toilet that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.|$|E

25|$|After a brief clash on the Confederate {{right flank}} between Fitzhugh Lee and the {{advancing}} brigade of Brig. Gen. George A. Custer, Custer led his brigade {{on a road}} southwest to Trevilian Station. He found the station totally unguarded, occupied only by Hampton's trains—supply wagons, caissons containing ammunition and food, and hundreds of horses. The 5th Michigan Cavalry captured the lot, but left Custer cut off from Sheridan, and {{in their pursuit of}} the fleeing wagons, lost a number of their own men and much of their bounty. One of Wright's regiments, the 7th Georgia, got between Custer's force and Trevilian Station. Custer ordered the 7th Michigan to charge, driving the Georgians back. Hampton now learned of the threat in his rear area and sent in three brigades. Suddenly Custer was virtually surrounded, his command in an ever-shrinking circle, as every side was charged and hit with shells. Sheridan heard the firing from Custer's direction and realized he needed help. He charged with two brigades, pushing Hampton's men <b>back</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> way to the station, while a third brigade swung into Fitzhugh Lee's exposed right flank, thus pushing him back. Hampton fell back to the west, Lee to the east, and the battle ended for the day with the Federals in possession of Trevilian Station.|$|E
