5|$|Lactarius blennius (commonly {{known as}} the Slimy Milkcap or <b>Beech</b> Milkcap) is a {{medium-sized}} mushroom of the genus Lactarius found commonly in <b>beech</b> forests in Europe, where it is mycorrhizal, favouring the European <b>Beech</b> (though associations with other trees are known). It was first described by Elias Magnus Fries. Though its colour and size vary, it is distinctive because it is slimy when wet and exudes copious amounts of milk. It {{has been the subject}} of some chemical research, and it can be used to produce pigments and blennins. Blennins, some of which have shown potential medical application, are derived from lactarane, a chemical so named because of their association with Lactarius. The edibility of L.blennius is uncertain, with different mycologists suggesting that it is edible (though not recommended), inedible or even poisonous.|$|E

5|$|Bisporella citrina is saprobic, and so obtains {{nutrients}} {{by breaking}} down complex organic molecules into simpler ones.

In a study of the succession of fungi associated with the decay of a 120-year-old healthy <b>beech</b> tree uprooted by strong winds, B.citrina was found on the wood about three years after the fall. It appeared after early colonizers such as Quaternaria quaternata, Tubercularia vulgaris (the anamorph form of Nectria cinnabarina), and Bulgaria inquinans, and was followed by Stereum hirsutum and Nectria cinnabarina.|$|E

5|$|Lactarius blennius is {{very common}} and is found in {{broad-leaved}} woodland, favouring beech; it is most associated with Fagus sylvatica, the European <b>Beech,</b> though {{it has also been}} observed growing in association with species of oak. It forms an ectomycorrhizal association with trees, and can grow {{on a wide variety of}} subsoil types, but is more typical of acidic soil. It is found between late summer and late autumn, and is native to Europe. The distribution of the mushroom coincides with the distribution of <b>beech.</b> In the British Isles, the species is one of the one hundred most common mushrooms. Other areas in which it has been recorded include Sweden, France, Italy, and Poland.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius subdulcis {{is found}} in Europe; it does not occur in North America, {{although}} a number of similar brownish-orange species were formerly classified under this species.

The mushrooms can be found from late summer to late autumn, and are common. They are found individually, or in small groups. They can also be found in fields, generally appearing in large batches, with groups of over a hundred mushrooms not uncommon.|$|E
5|$|On {{the same}} day as the {{formation}} of the Anglo-French hunter groups, Admiral Graf Spee captured the steamer Newton <b>Beech.</b> Two days later, she encountered and sank the merchant ship Ashlea. On 8 October, the following day, she sank Newton <b>Beech,</b> which Langsdorff had been using to house prisoners. Newton <b>Beech</b> was too slow to keep up with Admiral Graf Spee, and so the prisoners were transferred to the cruiser. On 10 October, she captured the steamer Huntsman, the captain of which had not sent a distress signal until the last minute, as he had mistakenly identified Admiral Graf Spee as a French warship. Unable to accommodate the crew from Huntsman, Admiral Graf Spee sent the ship to a rendezvous location with a prize crew. On 15 October, Admiral Graf Spee rendezvoused with Altmark to refuel and transfer prisoners; the following morning, the prize Huntsman joined the two ships. The prisoners aboard Huntsman were transferred to Altmark and Langsdorff then sank Huntsman on the night of 17 October.|$|E
