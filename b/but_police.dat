5|$|On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed {{a public}} meeting of 3,000 people {{organised}} by Kahr in the Bürgerbräukeller, a beer hall in Munich.

Hitler's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters, but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support.

MacDowall disappeared in Belize in early 1995 <b>but</b> <b>police</b> could not conclusively match him to body parts later found in that country; the only suspicious activity they uncovered was the transfer of £21,000 from MacDowall's bank account to an account in San Francisco under Martin's name.

Martin refused to be interviewed by Scotland Yard while he was on death row in Changi Prison, thus whether he killed MacDowall remains unconfirmed. Shackel was reported missing while on holiday in Cancún, Mexico. Police reports said that Martin was in Cancún the day Shackel cashed traveller's cheques worth £4,000, after which he disappeared.|$|E
