40|$|The {{triangular}} distribution {{is commonly used}} in simulation projects to represent probabilistic processes in absence of detailed data. The distribution can take {{on a variety of}} shapes and requires three easy to estimate <b>basic</b> <b>parameters</b> – minimum, maximum, and most likely. This paper considers two situations where different information is available than the three <b>basic</b> <b>parameters.</b> The paper provides means to use different information to estimate the remaining distribution parameters. The first situation commonly occurs in practice. For example, detail data may not be available, but the mean is known; thus, only two <b>basic</b> <b>parameters</b> need to be specified. The second situation occurs in research where controlled comparisons need to be made. For example, {{in order to understand the}} effect of variability on a system, means and general shape need to be held constant; thus, by fixing these two characteristics, only one of the <b>basic</b> <b>parameters</b> needs to be specified. ...|$|R

The key to effectively control rockfall hazards is {{to obtain an}} accurate rockfall trajectory. However, not only is rockfall trajectory complex and unable to be described accurately in mathematical formula, but <b>basic</b> <b>parameters</b> influencing its movement are also unable to be measured directly. Therefore, the back analysis method combining laboratory rockfall simulation test with computer numerical simulation is adopted to study rockfall trajectory and its <b>basic</b> <b>parameters.</b> The {{results show that the}} method can not only get <b>basic</b> <b>parameters</b> of rockfall trajectory such as coefficient of restitution and angle of frication, but also precisely deduce true rockfall trajectory, which can provide help in effectively controlling rockfall hazards...|$|R

Also, has been important the “touching” incorporation as interaction element “user-interface” because it establishes simpler protocols and obligates to synthesize the distribution of the information. Some investigators usually define the 2.0 era (and its devices) precisely for what the new design of the information involves in reduced screen. The 2.0 refers to the size, the portability and today, refers to the possibility to manage the transfer of information without physical anchors to networks through 3G devices of reduced dimensions.|$|E
5000|$|In the Indian {{mathematical}} tradition, the sine ( [...] or jya) of {{an angle}} {{is not a}} ratio of numbers. It is {{the length of a}} certain line segment, a certain half-chord. The radius of the base circle is <b>basic</b> <b>parameter</b> for the construction of such tables. Historically, several tables have been constructed using different values for this parameter. Āryabhaṭa has chosen the number 3438 as the value of radius of the base circle for the computation of his sine table. The rationale of the choice of this parameter is the idea of measuring the circumference of a circle in angle measures. In astronomical computations distances are measured in degrees, minutes, seconds, etc. In this measure, the circumference of a circle is 360° = (60 × 360) minutes = 21600 minutes. The radius of the circle, the measure of whose circumference is 21600 minutes, is21600 / 2π minutes. Computing this using the value π = 3.1416 known to Aryabhata one gets the radius of the circle as 3438 minutes approximately. Āryabhaṭa's sine table is based on this value for the radius of the base circle. It has not yet been established who is the first ever to use this value for the base radius. But Aryabhatiya is the earliest surviving text containing a reference to this basic constant.|$|E
