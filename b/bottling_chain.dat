50|$|Sus Antigoon is an {{ancestor}} of Spike, discoverer of Amoras Island {{and founder of}} the city Amoras. He died of alcohol abuse and therefore always appears as a ghost with a <b>bottle</b> <b>chained</b> to his leg. Because of his drunkenness, Sus Antigoon often brings the protagonists in danger. He has appeared in 12 albums so far.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{contents}} are under high pressure and are sometimes hazardous, there are special safety regulations for handling bottled gases. These include <b>chaining</b> <b>bottles</b> to prevent falling and breaking, proper ventilation to prevent {{injury or death}} in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} an {{integrated}} simulation {{model of a}} closed loop distribution system of water refillable <b>bottles</b> supply <b>chain.</b> In particular, {{the target of the}} research consists in evaluating the impact that the introduction of new nodes in the logistics configurations can have on service level to customers and on resources allocation, programming and scheduling. A case study of a distributor system that serves a limited geographical area is presented, to identify its performance parameters and how their variations can influence immobilizations, stock-outs and procurement time of restaurants served and fill production requirements...|$|R
5000|$|Perhaps {{the most}} common metric item sold is the two-liter <b>bottle.</b> Some {{supermarket}} <b>chains</b> also make their store brand soft drinks available in 3-liter sizes. Soft drink containers of 1 and 0.5 liters (and more recently 1.25 liter bottles) are sometimes sold alongside 12 fl oz, 16 fl oz, 20 fl oz, and 24 fl oz (355, 473, 591 and 710 mL) sizes.|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, {{the first}} Bratz Babyz were made. The babyz were [...] "Cloe", [...] "Sasha", [...] "Jade" [...] and [...] "Yasmin" [...] (the first Bratz.) The dolls {{came with a}} {{changing}} bag, a nap blanket, <b>bottle</b> on a <b>chain</b> and a pet based on the girl's nickname (e.g. Sasha's nickname is Bunny Boo, so she has a bunny.) Later on, in 2005, [...] "Meygan", [...] "Fianna", [...] "Cameron" [...] and [...] "Dana" [...] joined the Bratz Babyz group.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{contents}} {{are under pressure}} and are sometimes hazardous materials, handling bottled gases are regulated. Regulations may include <b>chaining</b> <b>bottles</b> to prevent falling and damaging the valve, proper ventilation to prevent injury or death in case of leaks and signage to indicate the potential hazards If a compressed gas cylinder tips over, causing the valve block to be sheared off, the rapid release of high-pressure gas may cause the cylinder to be violently accelerated, potentially causing property damage, injury, or death. To prevent this, cylinders are normally secured to a fixed object or transport cart with a strap or chain.|$|R
5000|$|Early 1990s {{there was}} a violent new group, {{according}} to journalist Paul Gageldonk by UEFA were considered the most violent core of Europe. This group was among others involved in the 'Battle of Beverwijk', where one or more Feyenoord hooligans killed F-side boy Carlo Picornie. Several other people were seriously injured. Because the fight was so heavy the riot police could look on only. According to some {{it was a miracle}} that [...] "just" [...] one man was killed. Feyenoord hooligans came armed with bats, <b>chains,</b> <b>bottles,</b> Molotov Cocktails, and tasers, many of which were seized by police after the battle. Earlier, in 1991 it was also a Feyenoord hooligan who killed FC Twente hooligan Erik Lassche, reportedly the first football death by violence. The violent reputation had its appeal to violent types who cared little about football.|$|R
5000|$|On March 23, 1997 the F-Side boys {{met with}} Feyenoord hooligans on a freeway outside Amsterdam in Beverwijk and the {{violence}} which followed has been {{come to be known}} as the Battle of Beverwijk. Interestingly, Feyenoord and Ajax had not played that day. During the battle Carlo(s) Picornie, an F-Side top boy, was killed and several other people were seriously injured. Because the fighting was so heavy, the riot police could only look on. According to some it was a miracle that [...] "just" [...] one man was killed. Feyenoord fans came armed with bats, <b>chains,</b> <b>bottles,</b> Molotov Cocktails, and tasers, many of which were seized by police after the battle. The death of Picornie is still fresh in the minds of Ajax fans and, to this day, his seat is left unoccupied at the stadium in remembrance of his murder.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} was conceptualized {{to investigate the}} potential impact of contracts on the sustainability of the <b>bottled</b> tawilis supply <b>chain,</b> i. e. sustainability in terms of environmental protection, well-being of the people whose livelihood depends on tawilis production, processing and marketing; and enhanced economic gains from the chain. A survey amongst fishermen, middlemen and processors was performed in the lake Taal area. The study concludes that formal contracts, with specific demands to gear used and the handling of fish, may stimulate the catch of minimum and uniform sized fish. Such contracts may also stimulate delivery of higher quality fish by fishermen. These contracts thereby enhance sustainable fishing and increase in fishermenâ€™s income. Direct (win-win) contracts between processors and fishermen seem to {{be the best way to}} stimulate delivery of sustainably catched fish. Government should strongly increase enforcement of sustainable fishing practices and stimulate contracting for sustainable fishing in this chain. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} investigates how to {{increase}} and improve school catering supply chains, to understand hindering factors and their perception {{in order to}} reveal drivers and constraints for POP. These include policy implementation instruments, changed values and attitudes, healthy nutrition policies, supply <b>chain</b> <b>bottle</b> necks, premium prices (to producers), successful procurement strategies and certification procedures. This work {{is based on a}} two-step survey concerning the Italian school food service system. Initially questionnaires were submitted to a qualified group of 50 producers and 50 caterers (managers of national and international companies of food service for school, local administrators who manage food services for the schools). The results of the questionnaires have subsequently been the basis to plan in-depth interviews with few decision makers who could represent both caterers and producers. The aim of this second step being to view how identified problems could be solved. The results show how the understanding and the acceptance of the organic food concept among the catering staff is crucial for the degree of success in each step of public organic procurement. The introduction of organic food in serving outlets needs appropriate support (such as qualification of key actors and a specific financial support). Other key aspects in this regard are laws and regulations promoting the procurement of quality food, policy interventions tackling more than one aspect of the problem, education programs, calls for tenders, negotiated procurement contracts and quality standards...|$|R
