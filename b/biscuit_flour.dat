The breastshot water wheel, which was sixteen foot, was installed in a separate brick built building which was located behind the mill house. This water wheel {{was replaced by a}} turbine in 1902. There was also a second waterwheel which was overshot using water that formed part of the Aylsham Navigation and gained its head by the close by lock system.The 1902 turbine was small and revolved at a much faster pace which removed the need several of the gear wheels which on larger, slow moving water wheels waste considerable power out-put. In 1965 this turbine was still producing 25% of the mill's power requirements. It had undergone a minor overhaul in 1930 and a major overhaul in the 1960s that would have left it capable of running for the next 40 years. The mills power was used to drive two and sometimes three pairs of millstones, which were in regular use for grinding animal food stuffs.

5000|$|Chlorine gas - both a {{bleaching}} agent and a maturing agent, {{but one that}} weakens gluten development. Chlorination also oxidizes starches in the flour, {{making it easier for}} the flour to absorb water and swell, resulting in thicker batters and stiffer doughs. The retarded gluten formation is desirable in cakes, cookies, and biscuits as it would otherwise make them tougher and bread-like. The modification of starches in the flour allows the use of wetter doughs (making for a moister end product) without destroying the structure necessary for light fluffy cakes and <b>biscuits.</b> Chlorinated <b>flour</b> allows cakes and other baked goods to set faster, rise better, the fat to be distributed more evenly, with less vulnerability to collapse.|$|R

40|$|The {{rheological}} {{characteristics of}} wheat flour doughs from the cultivars Obelisk and Katepwa and of <b>biscuit</b> <b>flour</b> doughs, {{and also of}} <b>biscuit</b> <b>flour</b> doughs containing glutens isolated from cv. Obelisk and cv. Katepwa flour, were compared and discussed in relation to bread making performance. Four different rheological methods were employed: two fundamental methods, i. e. dynamic (oscillatory) and uniaxial compression tests, and two empirical methods, i. e. tests using a Brabender Extensograph and a Chopin Alveograph. The fundamental methods showed that a dough of cv. Katepwa flour had a higher resistance to deformation and was more elastic than a dough of cv. Obelisk flour. Doughs of <b>biscuit</b> <b>flour</b> exhibited an intermediate behaviour, except that loss tangent values were close to those of a cv. Obelisk flour dough. Addition of cv. Obelisk gluten to <b>biscuit</b> <b>flour</b> hardly affected the rheological behaviour, whereas addition of cv. Katepwa gluten resulted in a higher resolution resistance to deformation and a higher elasticity. Uniaxial compression tests clearly showed the strain hardening and strain rate thinning characteristics of the flour doughs, which were most pronounced for a dough of cv. Katepwa flour. The rheological characteristics of cv. Obelisk and cv. Katepwa flour doughs and of <b>biscuit</b> <b>flour</b> doughs containing the glutens corresponded {{with those of the}} isolated hydrated glutens. The information about the rheological behaviour of the flour doughs obtained by the four methods was complementary and in good agreement, despite differences in applied strains, deformation rates and modes of deformation. The empirical tests showed that the extensibility of the <b>biscuit</b> <b>flour</b> dough was less compared to that of the other doughs. This study suggests that in order to obtain a high loaf volume and a fine crumb structure, wheat flour dough has to exhibit biaxial strain hardening and extensibility exceeding a minimum level; {{it is likely that the}} resistance to deformation may vary within a certain range.

40|$|AIM: To {{investigate}} {{the relation between}} bone parameters and the metabolic syndrome criteria, {{before and after the}} administration of two different natural dietary supplements in middle aged working obese Egyptian women suffering from metabolic syndrome (MetS). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty eight middle aged obese female volunteers suffering from metabolic syndrome were divided into two groups. During the first period, group (A) consumed a low caloric diet and nutritional supplement consisting of doum <b>flour</b> <b>biscuits,</b> while group (B) consumed whole meal wheat <b>flour</b> <b>biscuit</b> with the same instructions. During the second period, both supplements were omitted. Assessment of blood pressure, relevant anthropometric parameters, lipid accumulation product, fasting blood glucose, uric acid, 25 hydroxy vitamin D (25 (OH) D), parathyroid hormone (PTH) and bone-specific alkaline phosphatase were performed. RESULTS: Data showed that although both supplements improved the MetS criteria and the bone health parameters, the supplement containing the doum flour proved to be more effective. CONCLUSION: These results confirm the benefit of doum in improving bone health parameter [25 (OH) D/PTH axis] in the MetS patients, beside the MetS criteria. So, we can conclude that natural effective supplements lead towards the optimization of biochemical parameters in favor of a healthy outcome...|$|R
