5|$|In {{the high}} school section, {{students}} in Secondary 1 to Secondary 3 (inclusive) must wear a white short-sleeved shirt with khaki short trousers and white socks, which must cover the ankle. The four metal buttons must be worn on the two front pockets and on both shoulders. The school collar pin should be worn on the left collar. Either white, blue or black shoes with either white or black laces must be worn. Secondary 4 students wear long <b>beige</b> trousers with a <b>beige</b> shirt, similar to the male students in the college section. College girls wear a <b>beige</b> blouse and a <b>beige</b> skirt. The uniform for the college section was retained from the former Hwa Chong Junior College, which was designed by a Malay girl of the pioneer batch.|$|E
5|$|The colour {{scheme of}} the house was <b>beige,</b> which {{included}} a <b>beige</b> piano. Chanel may have been assisted in her design of the interior of La Pausa by Stéphane Boudin, the president of the interior design firm Maison Jansen.|$|E
5|$|The variety violaceotinctus {{is used in}} {{mushroom}} dyeing, {{and produces}} a light yellow, <b>beige,</b> gold, or brownish-orange color depending on the mordant used.|$|E
50|$|Since she did {{not have}} any {{children}} Ms. <b>Beiger</b> left the mansion in trust as a home for the care of elderly women. Ms. <b>Beiger</b> willed 210 thousand dollars of her 1.55 million dollar estate to care for and maintain the home and its furnishings. The home for the care of the elderly was opened February 1, 1930.|$|R
50|$|Ulrich <b>Beiger</b> (26 August 1918 - 18 September 1996) was a German actor.|$|R
50|$|Off-white {{colors were}} pervasively paired with <b>beiges</b> in the 1930s, and {{especially}} popular again from roughly 1955 to 1975.|$|R
5|$|Just {{before the}} 1975 tournament, the common <b>beige</b> {{sand in the}} bunkers was {{replaced}} with the now-signature white feldspar. It is a quartz derivative of the mining of feldspar and is shipped in from North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} this and other Hydnellum species are prized by {{mushroom}} dyers. The colors may range from <b>beige</b> when no mordant is used, to various shades of blue or green depending on the mordant added.|$|E
5|$|The gray {{mouse lemur}} shares many traits with other mouse lemurs, {{including}} soft fur, a long tail, long hind limbs, a dorsal stripe {{down the back}} (not always distinct), a short snout, rounded skull, prominent eyes, and large, membranous, protruding ears. It has large eyes and a tapetum lucidum to enhance its vision at night. The dorsal coat is brownish-gray with various reddish tones, the flanks are light gray to <b>beige,</b> and the ventral fur has discrete dull <b>beige</b> or whitish-beige patches along portions of the belly. On the rounded face, there is a pale white patch above the nose and between the eyes; some individuals have dark orbital markings. The furred portions of the hands and feet are off-white.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Beiger</b> Mansion, {{pronounced}} By-gur, though known more colloquially as Bee-gur, was the palatial home of Martin Valentine and Susie Higgins <b>Beiger</b> at 317 Lincoln Way E. in Mishawaka, Indiana. In 1973 it {{was added}} to the National Register of Historic Places. Built in 1903 the home was burned to the ground in 1975 and has since been restored, though not to its former grandeur. The restoration process is still ongoing. It is now operated as a bed and breakfast and event facility.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Beiger</b> Mansion, {{built in}} 1903 and {{restored}} in 1973, was gutted by arson in 1974. The building {{has since been}} renovated. It is operated as a bed-and-breakfast and events facility.|$|R
50|$|Martin V. <b>Beiger,</b> born February 3, 1847, was Mishawaka's first millionaire. Martin {{made his}} fortune with the Mishawaka Woolen and Rubber Manufacturing Company, which would later become Ball Band then Uniroyal. He, along with his father Jacob <b>Beiger,</b> bought the small {{textiles}} mill in 1867. The mill originally had just 3 workers and mostly made flannels. He married Susie Higgins, {{the daughter of a}} local jeweler, in December 1875. In 1886 Martin <b>Beiger,</b> along with Adolphus Eberhart, patented the first all knit wool boot that did not loose shape or size. Demand for this product quickly grew the company. The boots were topped with a black band and, later, a red ball which became the companies trade mark. Ball Band went on to employ 5000 workers by 1923 and as many as 10000 in the 1940s. By 1903 the company had around 2000 employees and Martin had become very wealthy. Soon he and Susie were considering a more lavish home in the style of some of New Port Rhode Island's mansions, particularly that of The Breakers.|$|R
5|$|The pseudoparenchymatous layer (a {{layer of}} thin-walled, usually angular, {{randomly}} arranged {{cells that are}} tightly packed) is initially <b>beige,</b> later brownish, in age dark brown, cracked and if moist reddish brown. The fibrous layer is beige-colored, with its outer side free from the mycelial layer except at {{the tips of the}} rays. The mycelial layer has a <b>beige</b> brown to somewhat yellowish-brown, felted to tufted outer surface, darkening to reddish-brown if moist. It is not encrusted with debris, but some debris and sand may adhere. The inner side is smooth, dull to somewhat glossy, and hazelnut brown.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{telephones}} {{at the farm}} on the night, {{all on the same}} landline. There was usually a cordless phone with a memory-recall feature in the kitchen; a <b>beige</b> digital phone, also kept in the kitchen; and a cream rotary phone in the main bedroom. (There was normally a fourth phone too, a blue digital phone in the first-floor office, but it had been sent for repairs on 5 August.) The rotary phone had at some point been moved out of the bedroom and into the kitchen, where the police found it after the murders with its receiver off the hook. They found the <b>beige</b> digital phone under a pile of magazines in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|While some pet rats {{retain the}} agouti {{coloring}} {{of the wild}} brown rat (three tones on the same hair), others have solid colors (a single color on each hair), a trait derived from rats with black coats. Agouti-based colors include agouti, cinnamon, and fawn. Black-based colors include black, <b>beige,</b> and chocolate.|$|E
50|$|On August 1, 1989, Ron Montandon {{purchased}} the mansion from the Historical Society. He has since worked {{to restore the}} mansion to its original grandeur. The current floor plan matches the original, {{and most of the}} landscaping is based on the original plans. Much of the current interior has been reproduced from pictures and accounts of the original home. In order to finance the restoration process, the mansion is currently operated as a 6-bedroom bed and breakfast and as an event facility known as the <b>Beiger</b> Mansion Inn. In February 2014 The <b>Beiger</b> Mansion Inn won the Mishawaka Business Association award for business of the year for 2013.|$|R
50|$|The male of {{this species}} has a {{wingspan}} of 18mm, head and front are clear brown, palpae <b>beiges,</b> fine and turned downwards. Antennae are dark-brown and largely pectinated. Thorax is brown-black, abdomen brown-black on the upperside, and brown-yellowish on the underside.|$|R
50|$|Henry <b>Beige's</b> ineptitude and uninterest in {{identifying}} the rustlers is infuriating to Brown, who angrily fires him. A distressed Laura explains to Curt {{that she needs to}} take care of her uncle and therefore will be leaving with him, unable to marry Curt.|$|R
5|$|Interior colour schemes {{varied from}} model to model, but {{shared a common}} design approach. The {{entry-level}} XT featured a black plastic panel for {{the upper half of}} the dashboard, with either a black, charcoal, or <b>beige</b> panel for the lower half. Not all variants offered the distinctive colour palette; the sports variants could not be optioned with the two-tone interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{shape of}} the modern, {{sweeping}} version of the madder and white livery was recognisable enough {{to be used with}} different colours; when East Lothian Buses (later Lothian Country Buses) was set up, their fleet used a version in green and <b>beige</b> (the colours of Scottish Midland Buses, which had once run similar routes before being absorbed by First).|$|E
5|$|White dripstones {{are pure}} calcite without defilement, the red color {{is given by}} iron oxide (rust) in small amounts. In Lebanon iron oxide has a red color instead of the brown <b>beige</b> color which is common in {{northern}} countries. The reason is a different chemical reaction caused by the high temperature which produces {{a different kind of}} iron oxide.|$|E
25|$|Jasper: Jasper is a {{gemstone}} of the chalcedony {{family that}} comes {{in a variety of}} colours. Often, jasper will feature unique and interesting patterns within the coloured stone. Picture jasper is a type of jasper known for the colours (often <b>beiges</b> and browns) and swirls in the stone’s pattern.|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the Battell Park Historic District, <b>Beiger</b> Mansion, and Old Mishawaka Carnegie Library, the Dodge House, Eller-Hosford House, Ellis-Schindler House, Kamm and Schellinger Brewery, Merrifield-Cass House, and Normain Heights Historic District are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The Tivoli Theater demolished in 2005, was formerly listed.|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{evidence}} suggests that microbes resident in the human intestine represent a key environmental factor contributing to obesity-associated disorders. Here, we demonstrate that the gut microbiota-initiated trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) -generating pathway is linked to obesity and energy metabolism. In multiple clinical cohorts, systemic levels of TMAO were observed to strongly associate with type 2 diabetes. In addition, circulating TMAO levels were associated with obesity traits in the different inbred strains represented in the Hybrid Mouse Diversity Panel. Further, antisense oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown or genetic deletion of the TMAO-producing enzyme flavin-containing monooxygenase 3 (FMO 3) conferred protection against obesity in mice. Complimentary mouse and human studies indicate a negative regulatory role for FMO 3 in the <b>beiging</b> of white adipose tissue. Collectively, our studies reveal {{a link between the}} TMAO-producing enzyme FMO 3 and obesity and the <b>beiging</b> of white adipose tissue...|$|R
5|$|Standard gear {{includes}} climate control, Blaupunkt sound, cruise control, full trip computer, rear park assist, {{traction control}} system, Electronic Stability Control, power mirrors and windows. The oil, voltage and temperature gauges are now digital. The interior offers {{a choice of}} light urban <b>beige,</b> white or black for the colours. The carpets remain dark as in the Holden Calais V-Series. The Senator Signature also offers a number of options such as a roof mounted DVD player, front park assist, rain sensing wipers and door entry lamps. Satellite navigation will become available as an option in the near future.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{structural}} steel frame {{was also a}} first for the city. It was covered in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carrières and Queenston. Due to the rapid construction, Saint-Marc-des-Carrières was unable to supply enough stone {{to keep up with}} demand on the building site, resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source. Saint-Marc-des-Carrières limestone is a pearly grey, and becomes a pale <b>beige</b> with age, while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages.|$|E
5|$|The {{child in}} the man's arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine's. Tanner {{described}} the man as white, dark-haired, 5ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or <b>beige</b> trousers and a dark jacket, and {{said he did not}} look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine's Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man (left), which was released in October 2007.|$|E
25|$|Improvements in {{chemistry}} enabled {{the introduction of}} waterproof mascara along with better lash lengtheners and thickeners. Matte colors were popular for eyes, {{in contrast to the}} iridescence that characterized 1960s make-up. The decade's competing visions of beauty were seen in its dichotomy of eye shadow colors: both dramatic, smoky dark gray and transparent, natural <b>beiges</b> and grays were popular.|$|R
50|$|While at St Paul's Girls School, {{she sang}} {{as part of}} the City Charmers, an all-female close harmony group, which won the TV talent contest Sky Star Search in 1990. While at university, Kate became a regular on the {{alternative}} cabaret circuit, singing at Lenny <b>Beige’s</b> Regency Rooms in Covent Garden and Indigo at Madame Jo Jo’s in Soho.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in the 1970s, police vehicle {{markings}} {{have become increasingly}} stylistic, with widespread use of computer-graphics and vinyl striping. While black and white designs are still in use in many jurisdictions, cars may range from being all white to completely black. Blues and greens of various hues are also frequently used. Brown, <b>beiges</b> and tans are favored by rural police and sheriff's offices.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} opens with several shots of a dining table; it {{includes}} uneaten sweets, foods, and small pink bird ornaments. The first verse features close-ups {{of the girls}} singing and dancing to the song, {{in front of a}} <b>beige</b> backdrop. The chorus section has three scenes of each member; Kashiyuka is seen laying down with an electronics cable in her hand; Nocchi is seen at the dining table; and A-Chan is seen under a table with a cable telephone. During the instrumental break, close-up shots (yet very blurry) features a fish bowl that have small fishing swimming around. The second verse repeats the first verses video shoots.|$|E
5|$|A louse's color {{varies from}} pale <b>beige</b> to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, {{it may become}} {{considerably}} darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are parthenogenetic, with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's egg is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized saliva; the saliva/hair bond {{is very difficult to}} sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to preening, such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower. Lice are exopterygotes, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as nymphs. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Bank, {{which was}} {{completely}} below ground, all stations had buildings designed by Harry Bell Measures. They were single-storey structures {{to allow for}} future commercial development above and had elevations faced in <b>beige</b> terracotta. Each station had lifts manufactured by the Sprague Electric Company in New York. The lifts were provided {{in a variety of}} sizes and configurations to suit the passenger flow at each station. Generally they operated in sets of two or three in a shared shaft. Station tunnel walls were finished in plain white ceramic tiles and lit by electric arc lamps. The electricity to run the trains and the stations was supplied from the power station at Wood Lane at 5,000V AC which was converted at sub-stations along the route to 550V DC to power the trains via a third rail system.|$|E
50|$|The Diary of Anne Frank was a 1967 TV film {{based on}} the book The Diary of a Young Girl by Anne Frank. The teleplay was {{directed}} by Alex Segal and it was adapted from play of the same name by Albert Hackett and Frances Goodrich. The film starred Max von Sydow, Diana Davila, Peter <b>Beiger,</b> Theodore Bikel and Lilli Palmer.|$|R
30|$|Cold {{exposure}} {{may also}} alter human physiology by cross-talking with immune cells to release cytokines capable of inducing fat browning. In mice, cold exposure rapidly promoted eosinophil-dependent and interleukin 4 (IL- 4)-stimulated alternative activation of adipose macrophages, which secrete catecholamines to induce thermogenic gene expression and/or lipolysis in both BAT and WAT (Qiu et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2011). ILC 2 s can promote the eosinophil/IL- 4 Rα/alternatively-activated macrophage (AAMac) (Qiu et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2011). Besides, ILC 2 s {{have been shown}} to promote <b>beiging</b> in an IL 33 -depend pathway in part via production of enkephalin peptides that elicit <b>beiging</b> (Brestoff et al., 2015). IL- 4 stimulation of human monocytes has also been reported to promote alternative activation, catecholamine production, lipolytic activity of adipocytes, and dysregulated ILC 2 responses in WAT are a conserved feature of obesity in humans and mice (Brestoff et al., 2015), suggesting these pathways may play the same roles across species (Nguyen et al., 2011). In humans, mild cold exposure increases plasma levels of fibroblast growth factor- 21 (FGF- 21) (Lee et al., 2013), a hormone that promotes systemic glucose uptake and oxidation. In hBAT, FGF- 21 expression positively correlates with UCP 1 expression, promotes BAT activity and recruits inducible brown adipocytes via autocrine and/or endocrine mechanisms (Hondares et al., 2014). Future studies aiming to identify secreted factors that promote thermogenesis and/or <b>beiging</b> will undoubtedly advance our understanding about thermogenic regulation and may lead to novel anti-obesity drug treatments.|$|R
30|$|In summary, {{aided by}} the new volume fluorescence-imaging technique, our study has {{revealed}} that intra-adipose sympathetic plasticity, regulated by the cold-elicited NGF-TrkA signal, exerts {{a key role in}} the <b>beiging</b> process of WAT. To our knowledge, this research work represents among the first examples demonstrating the physiological relevance, together with the molecular mechanism, of local sympathetic plasticity in neural regulation of the peripheral metabolism.|$|R
