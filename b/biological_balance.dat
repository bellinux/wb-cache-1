40|$|Black spruce (Picea mariana (Mill.) B. S. P.) is the {{dominant}} tree species in the Canadian province of Québec’s boreal ecosystem, particularly in the black spruce-feathermoss (BSFM) domain (between the 49 th and the 52 nd parallels). While black spruce is generally well adapted to regenerate after wildfires, regeneration failure can sometimes occur, resulting in the irreversible conversion of closed-crown BSFM to open black spruce-lichen woodlands (OW). With OWs representing approximately 7 % (1. 6 M ha) of Québec’s BSFM domain, the afforestation of OWs carries significant theoretical potential for carbon (C) sequestration, which {{has not yet been}} evaluated. The main objectives of the study were then: (i) to estimate the theoretical C balance of OW afforestation within the closed-crown BSFM domain in Québec’s boreal forest; (ii) to calculate, using the life cycle analysis (LCA) method, all the GHG emissions related to black spruce OW afforestation in the closed-crown BSFM domain of Québec. The CO 2 FIX v. 3. 1 model was used to calculate the <b>biological</b> C <b>balance</b> between the baseline (natural OW of site index 9 at age 50) and afforestation (black spruce plantation of site index 6 at age 25) scenarios, using the best estimates available for all five recommended C compartments (aboveground biomass, belowground biomass, litter, deadwood, and soil). The simulation revealed a <b>biological</b> C <b>balance</b> of 77. 0 t C ha− 1, 70 years following afforestation, for an average net sequestration rate of 1. 1 t C ha− 1 year− 1. <b>Biological</b> C <b>balance</b> only turns positive after 27 years. When integrating the uncertainties related to both the plantation growth yield and the wildfire disturbance, the average sequestration rate varies between 0. 2 and 1. 9 t C ha− 1 year− 1. GHG emissions are 1. 3 t CO 2 equiv. ha− 1 for all afforestation-related operations, which is less than 0. 5 % of the <b>biological</b> C <b>balance</b> after 70 years. Thus, GHG emissions do not significantly affect the net C balance of the afforestation project simulated. Several recommendations are made, mostly centered on the factors influencing the growth rate of carbon stocks and the impact of natural disturbances, to minimize the range of uncertainties associated to the sequestration potential and maximize the mitigation benefits of an OW afforestation project...|$|R

More, eight urban discharges drain directly into the basin, and the most significant is Canale D'Aiedda (south, second inlet). Mar Piccolo, because of its characteristic of semi-enclosed basin with marked problems of water exchange due mainly to moderate sea-tides, represents a marine ecosystem where <b>biological</b> <b>balances</b> have been modified, in relation to the anthropic development and, in particular, the large industrial settlement. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and occur primarily as a result of anthropogenic inputs, while a little contribution comes from events as forest fires (Compaan et al., 1992). Transport to the marine environment occurs both via surface waters and the atmosphere; because of their low aqueous solubilities, PAHs tend to adsorb to particulate material and to be deposited to the underlying sediments (Law & Biscaya, 1994), where they can accumulate to high concentrations. Due to their wide environmental distribution, mutagenic and carcinogenic properties, PAHs merit concerted environmental monitoring. The objective of this study was to determine the concentrations, distribution and sources of PAHs in surface sediments from the Mar Piccolo (Ionian Sea), adjacent area of Taranto harbour one of the mains in Italy...|$|R

40|$|Shoreline and {{mangrove}} form {{a dynamic}} ecosystem to coastal area. They support and supply various foods and protections {{for the purpose}} of environmental friendly and <b>biological</b> <b>balancing</b> around the world. A dynamic phenomenon like shoreline requires the presence of spatial and temporal data to represent and visualize the object’s shape and their positions over time. This study is significant to provide a first view of the interaction and response of mangrove species to shoreline change. It utilized the use of multi-sources spatial data to provide shoreline positions between 1997 and 2011. GIS technology along with remote sensing has been proved to be a potential approach to integrate multi-sources spatial data thus enables the derivation of multi-dated shoreline positions. Statistical computation using Digital Shoreline Analysis System (DSAS) was applied to determine the rate of shoreline change along the Coast of Kukup Island. Findings show that the shoreline along the northwest of island appeared to move backward with the rates of shoreline erosion varied between 5. 45 m/yr and 9. 33 m/yr. However, accretion activities occurred along the northern and eastern areas of island ranged between 0. 05 m/yr and 4. 58 m/yr. Mangrove profile study revealed that Rhizophora apiculata was the dominant species inhabit along the shoreline of Kukup Island. Comparison of Rhizophora apiculata physical characteristic and shoreline change rates demonstrated a significant correlation, suggesting that the maturity of mangrove trees found in the area help to reduce the erosion effects. The species that equipped with various advantages enable this mangrove to survive the harsh conditions that come from the ocean and terrestrial. Therefore, the integration of GIS, remote sensing, and statistical method has efficiently improved the analysis of shoreline change and mangrove response due to its cost effectiveness and data maintenance...|$|R
