To maximize throughput in asyn-chronous pipelines it is often necessary to insert <b>buffer</b> <b>stages,</b> increasing the energy overhead. Instead of optimizing pipelines for minimum energy or maximum throughput, we consider a joint energy-time metric of the form Eo/ ff, where E is the energyper operation and o / is the time per operation. We show that pipelines optimized for the Eo/ ff energy-time metric may need fewer <b>buffer</b> <b>stages</b> and we give bounds when such stages can be removed.

40|$|Feature Issue on Next-Generation WDM Network Design and Routing (WDMN) We {{present a}} new {{architecture}} of an optical burst-switching (OBS) switch {{that consists of}} several <b>buffered</b> <b>stages</b> using wavelength-division multiplexing (WDM) fiber delay lines for buffering. The proposed switch architecture can cost effectively implement a large buffer depth. The use of WDM in sharing the fiber delay lines allows the proposed switch to emulate efficiently an output buffered switch using random-access memory under first-in first-out (FIFO) scheduling. To handle the case of non-FIFO scheduling, such as fair queueing, the <b>buffered</b> <b>stages</b> are interconnected by a switching fabric so that intermediate increment of burst delays is possible and non-FIFO scheduling algorithms can be implemented. Thus the proposed switch can deal with bursty traffic and provide different quality of service (QoS). Simulations have been performed to verify {{the performance of the}} proposed switch architecture for providing differentiated services (DiffServ). The proposed switch architecture is also compared with other switch architectures in the literature. © 2003 Optical Society of America...|$|R

5000|$|The voltage-frequency {{relationship}} for the chip {{can also be}} determined by using another approach in which a critical path monitor tries to model the critical path of the chip.The critical path of the system can be duplicated using a ring oscillator or by a fanout of four Ring oscillator or a delay line. This critical path replica (delay line [...] )provides the closest behavior to the actual critical path except for the intra-die variations and cross coupling capacitances which are hard to duplicate. This delay line adapts to environmental and process variations. As the actual performance of the core and {{the speed of the}} delay line are directly related, a closed-loop adaptive voltage scaling system is obtained to automatically adjust the supply voltage such that the minimum needed voltage is supplied so as to perform the target task.The delay chain consists of inverters, NAND gates, wire segments,etc., and the output can be tapped from one of the points, thus allowing tuning of the delay to match chips critical path. A reconfigurable delay chain can also be used in a critical path monitoring technique. It is during the manufacturing test, the exact setting of the delay chain is determined. During the AVS operation, in order to measure the delay launch an edge {{at the start of the}} clock cycle and then capture the edge at the end of the clock cycle at the output of delay chain and a set of buffers. Then the buffer outputs that are captured are analyzed to determine the exact positioning of the rising edge. Now the feedback employed by the AVS system continually adjusts the supply voltage such that the delay chain and critical path meet the timing constraints with adequate margins. The adjustment of supply voltage is done such that the launched rising edge makes it to a specified <b>buffer</b> <b>stage</b> which ensures the timing of delay line.|$|E

The tablets were subjected to weight variation, hardness, friability and drug content test and invitro release studies.

40|$|Aim To {{compare the}} {{dissolution}} profi les of various enteric-coated low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) tablets marketed in Indonesia. Methods The dissolution study {{was carried out}} according to US Pharmacocopoeiae (USP) /European Pharmacopoeiae, method A, using USP apparatus 1 (basket) 100 rpm, with 2 media: 0. 1 N HCl, 120 minutes for acid stage, and phosphate buffer pH 6. 8, 90 minutes for <b>buffer</b> <b>stage.</b> The sampling points were 120 minutes for the acid stage, and every 10 minutes until 90 minutes for the <b>buffer</b> <b>stage.</b> The acetylsalicylic acid was assayed using spectrophotometry at 280 nm for the acid stage, and at 265 nm for the <b>buffer</b> <b>stage.</b> The free salicylic acid was determined {{only at the end}} of the <b>buffer</b> <b>stage</b> with HPLC method. There were 6 test products (Cardio Aspirin® 100 mg, Aptor® 100 mg, Ascardia® 80 mg, Thrombo Aspilet® 80 mg, Astika® 100 mg and Farmasal® 100 mg), 3 batches for each product, and 6 units for each batch. Results The amount of ASA released from each ASA product tested at the end of acid stage (120 minutes) ranged from  1. 79 % for Cardio Aspirin® to 6. 92 % for Thrombo Aspilet®, all conformed to the compendial requirement for enteric-coated product (< 10 %). The amount of salicylic acid observed {{at the end of the}} dissolution test ranged from 3. 47 % for Cardio Aspirin® to 10. 90 % for Astika® and 11. 90 % for Thrombo Aspilet®. Thrombo Aspilet® showed sustained-release properties, causing high variability in ASA release, such that one of the 3 batches tested did not fulfill the compendial requirement of more than 75 % (the release was only 55. 11 %). High variability in ASA release between batches was also found with Farmasal® at 10, 20, and 30 minutes in buffer medium. The lowest effective dose of ASA as an antiplatelet drug for longterm use is 75 mg of plain ASA, and this is equivalent to 100 mg of enteric-coated ASA. Conclusions All of the low-dose ASA preparations marketed in Indonesia are enteric-coated products, while Thrombo Aspilet® is not only an enteric-coated but also a sustained-release product. Cardio Aspirin®, followed by Aptor®, has the right dose for low-dose enteric-coated preparation (100 mg), produces consistent ASA release between batches, and the most stable towards deacetylation (antiplatelet inactivation).

40|$|In this paper, {{the novel}} “tapered-Vth” {{approach}} to design energy-efficient CMOS buffers is introduced. In this approach, the substantial energy consumption due to leakage {{is reduced by}} tapering the threshold voltage throughout the <b>buffer</b> <b>stages,</b> other than tapering the transistor size. More specifically, the threshold voltage is progressively reduced when going from the last to the first stage. This enables a considerable leakage reduction in the last stages (which contribute most to the overall leakage) {{at the price of}} a higher delay. The resulting delay penalty is then compensated by reducing the transistor threshold voltage in the first stages, with an insignificant leakage increase (they contribute very little to the overall buffer leakage).
