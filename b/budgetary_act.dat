40|$|Earmarked {{funds are}} {{mentioned}} in the Polish Public Finances Act {{as one of the}} five organisational legal forms of budget management. This article deals with their legal status. Establishing the legal status of earmarked funds requires a comparative analysis based on administrative and tax law. As an introduction the author discussed the notion of a fund both in colloquial and legal language. Next she analysed the dogmatic and legal definition of this notion on the basis of regulations in force and the doctrine of financial law, pointing to inaccuracies in legal regulations. As a result there are considerable interpretative difficulties e. g. in establishing a catalogue of earmarked funds. From the financial and legal point of view it was necessary to consider the legal nature c f revenue and expenditure and the nature of financial plan of earmarked funds. The relation between plans of earmarked funds and <b>budgetary</b> <b>acts</b> and resolutions was also emphasised. The issues of the legal from of earmarked funds and the nature of property administered by the funds required a civil legal analysis. The analysis of administrative legal status of earmarked funds is based on the organisational and territorial structures of particular funds, the nature and competence of fund agencies. It seems that the essence of funds was not taken into consideration properly in the Polish tax law. Earmarked funds functioning on the basis of regulations in the Public Finances Act enjoy exemption from tax. Still, the way the issue is settled is debatable. Legal forms on which earmarked funds are based are non-uniform and casuistic. For that reason establishing a catalogue of universal legal properties of earmarked funds is problematic...|$|R

The {{sources of income}} from various state own tax revenue have increased except other taxes on income and expenditure. There is further scope for improving sources of state own tax revenue. After the FRBM Act, the development expenditure on irrigation and flood control, industry and mining has declined in the state. It is statistically significant and negatively co-related. The development expenditure on education sports, arts & culture, science, technology & environment, and transport & communication has significantly increased. In order to control the fiscal deficit, state government should apply strict methods to reduce the non development expenditure. It should increase development expenditure which has long term effect on overall economic development. ...|$|R

We describe a general view on Spanish Autonomous Communities (ACs) financial resources, {{in the context of}} the Stability and Growth Pact and <b>Budgetary</b> Stability <b>Act.</b> From 2002, such regulation imposes several constraints to ACs’ indebtness. In this paper, we find out about the roll of PSEs as an alternative way to traditional debt mechanisms. Thus, according to Eurostat criteria, PSEs’ debt can be taken off the public sector’s consolidated budget. Descriptive and econometric results confirm our expectations. ACs’ have used public enterprises to avoid the stringent financial rules. Additionally, it seems that low productivity ACs are accumulating more public debt outside the scope of consolidation.

40|$|For {{the republics}} of the former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) as for many other {{transition}} economies, {{an important step in}} introducing a more market-oriented system was the restructuring of their budget systems. This paper reviews and evaluates the process of budget system reform during the transition period extending from the time they emerged from the collapse of the SFRY in 1989 until the end of 2002. For at least a decade of this period, the Fiscal Affairs Department of the IMF has been providing technical assistance (TA) to these countries to facilitate such reforms. Based on the material generated by this effort, the authors offer a review of the progress made and an assessment of the reform elements still to be completed. Given that the former Yugoslav republics all commenced the reform process with the same institutions, this paper offers a unique opportunity to analyze the critical elements in successful budget system reform. An attempt is made to explain the varying degrees of success experienced by different countries, and a reform agenda is suggested to guide future TA.

Indeed, history is full of episodes in which the financial position of the public sector is substantially altered-or its true nature uncovered-as a result of government bailouts of financial or nonfinancial entities, in both the private and the public sector. The paper discusses theoretical and practical issues raised by contingent liabilities, including the rationale for taking them on, how to safeguard against the fiscal risks associated with them, how to account and budget for them, and how to disclose them. Country experiences are used to illustrate ways these issues are addressed in practice and challenges faced. The paper also points to good practices related to the mitigation, management and disclosure of risks from contingent liabilities.

40|$|Fiscal Responsibility Laws (FRLs) {{appear to}} be more popular in middle-income {{countries}} than advanced countries, even though their success is limited. The reasons why few advanced countries have a FRL include: the existing legal framework for the budget system is adequate; supranational rules and political agreements in EU countries; failed attempts to include quantitative fiscal rules in laws; lack of consensus or interest in attaining the goals of FRL-type legislation; and lack of need for a law to regulate fiscal transparency, accountability and macro-fiscal stabilization. Without commitment to fiscal discipline, adoption of a FRL may not contribute to attaining fiscal consolidation goals.
