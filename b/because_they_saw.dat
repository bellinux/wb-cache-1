5|$|Lewis {{argues that}} Applewhite {{effectively}} controlled his followers by packaging his teachings in familiar terms. Richard Hecht of the University of California, Santa Barbara, echoes this sentiment, arguing {{that members of}} the group killed themselves because they believed the narrative that he had constructed, rather than because he psychologically controlled them. In his 2000 study of apocalyptic movements, John R. Hall posits that they were motivated to commit suicide <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> {{it as a way to}} demonstrate that they had conquered the fear of death and truly believed Applewhite.|$|E
5|$|When the American Revolutionary War {{began in}} 1775, the Ohio River marked a tenuous {{border between the}} American colonies and the American Indians of the Ohio Country. Ohio Indians—Shawnees, Mingos, Delawares, and Wyandots—were divided over {{how to respond to}} the war. Some Indian leaders urged neutrality, while others entered the war <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it as an {{opportunity}} to halt the expansion of the American colonies and to regain lands previously lost to the colonists.|$|E
5|$|The White armies were {{established}} by former Tsarist military officers, and included Anton Denikin's Volunteer Army in South Russia, Alexander Kolchak's forces in Siberia, and Nikolai Yudenich's {{troops in the}} newly independent Baltic states. The Whites were bolstered when 35,000 members of the Czech Legion – prisoners of war from the conflict with the Central Powers – turned against Sovnarkom and allied with the Committee of Members of the Constituent Assembly (Komuch), an anti-Bolshevik government established in Samara. The Whites were also backed by Western governments who perceived the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk as a betrayal of the Allied war effort and feared the Bolsheviks' calls for world revolution. In 1918, the United Kingdom, France, United States, Canada, Italy, and Serbia landed 10,000 troops in Murmansk, seizing Kandalaksha, while later that year British, American, and Japanese forces landed in Vladivostok. Western troops soon {{pulled out of the}} civil war, instead only supporting the Whites with officers, technicians and armaments, but Japan remained <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the conflict as an opportunity for territorial expansion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Would you?" [...] cries George, and {{his cheeks}} and Theo's {{simultaneously}} flushed up with red; I suppose <b>because</b> <b>they</b> both <b>saw</b> Hetty's bright young eyes watching them.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are people}} in my land who deny that there is One, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> never <b>saw,</b> or felt, or heard Him--so they say they cannot know," [...] said Rooney. Angut looked surprised.|$|R
6000|$|Ada now {{came running}} up to them, saying, 'Maurice and Redgie, you are to come in; Mr. and Mrs. Burnet heard your voices, and begged to see you, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> never <b>saw</b> you last holidays.' ...|$|R
25|$|They were {{uneasy about}} {{cooperating}} on measures {{against the white}} slave traffic with governments that regulated prostitution <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the governments as hypocritical in maintaining a system that created demand for the trafficked women.|$|E
25|$|The {{right of}} local unions to strike {{was the primary}} issue in the negotiations. During his {{re-election}} campaign, Miller {{had been forced to}} accept as a collective bargaining goal the right to strike over local issues. But the owners rejected Miller's demand <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> he was unable to bring wildcat strikers back to the bargaining table.|$|E
25|$|After {{the clubs}} {{bankruptcy}} in summer 2010, Frem got {{a helping hand}} from Danish brewery giant Carlsberg. Being from the same city they signed on as main sponsor, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it {{as a chance to}} help the fellow Valby-based brand back on its feet. In July 2013 an extension for three years was announced. On June 11, 2016 it was prolonged for another three years.|$|E
5000|$|Boxing Island (...) is a {{small island}} lying in Charlotte Bay east of Harris Peak, off {{the west coast of}} Graham Land. It was first charted by the Belgian Antarctic Expedition under Gerlache, 1897-99, and so named by members of the Falkland Islands Dependencies Survey <b>because</b> <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> it on Boxing Day 1956.|$|R
60|$|Then {{the chief}} again rose, and bade them welcome. There were some fifty or sixty of them, but Ned {{and his friend}} had no fear of any treachery, for they were evidently {{under the spell of}} a sense of amazement greater than that which had been excited among those they first met; and this <b>because</b> <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> this wonder by night.|$|R
50|$|Through their {{increasing}} interest in politics the students quickly engaged in discussions concerning {{the war in}} Vietnam. They formed the opinion that the United States {{had no right to}} fight in Vietnam, {{not only because of the}} victims but mainly <b>because</b> of what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as an imperialistic foreign policy.|$|R
25|$|The {{pairing of}} Sam and Diane has evoked mixed reactions. Some critics disliked the relationship, either for alienating viewers by {{dominating}} the show (and removing its original premise) or <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> Sam and Diane as a mismatch. Others praised the pair, seeing them as strengthening the show. Some writers compared them to couples in later shows, such as Moonlighting, with their sexual tension and intermittent relationships.|$|E
25|$|During the Babylonian captivity, Daniel and {{his fellow}} Jews abstained from the meat and wine given {{to them by the}} king <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it as defiling in some way, though {{precisely}} how these would have defiled the Jews is not apparent in the text. A later passage implies that Daniel did drink wine at times, though {{it may not have been}} the king's. Similarly, Judith refused the Assyrian general's wine, though she drank wine from the stores she brought with her.|$|E
25|$|The Vanyar, the Noldor, {{and those}} of the Teleri who reached Valinor are called the Calaquendi (Elves of Light) <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the Two Trees. In the {{language}} of the Noldor in Aman all other Elves were called the Moriquendi (Elves of Darkness) in recognition {{of the fact that they}} did not see (and did not desire) the Light of Valinor, but later the Sindar were counted among neither of these groups. Instead, Moriquendi was used for all other elves except Noldor, Vanyar, and Sindar.|$|E
50|$|Rising together, {{just as the}} Earthmen {{did when}} the School was sacked, they enter a spaceship, which rises above the atmosphere. Norvis is shown what the Great Light really is, and how far away it is. He sees his planet from above, the first Nidorian to do so. Smith {{explains}} that when the Earthmen first encountered Nidor, {{it was the first}} time they had found a species they had anything in common with, albeit one that had no inkling of other worlds, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> never <b>saw</b> the sun or stars.|$|R
5000|$|Elite Gendarmes (Gendarmerie dElite): Nicknamed The Immortals <b>because</b> <b>they</b> rarely <b>saw</b> combat, the Gendarmes {{nonetheless}} {{performed a}} vital role. Gendarmes were {{the military police}} of La Grande Armée. Along with maintaining security and order near the headquarters, the Gendarmes would provide honour guards for high-ranking visitors, interrogate prisoners and protect the Emperors personal baggage. The Gendarmes wore dark blue coats with red lapels and tall boots, along with a bearskin slightly smaller {{than that of the}} Horse Grenadiers. After 1807, the Gendarmes began to see more combat, distinguishing themselves in guarding the Danube bridge at Aspern-Essling in 1809.|$|R
6000|$|All {{things have}} their natural {{goodness}} by creation. Things are not good, <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have a being only, but because God gave them such a being. Neither did God make them, <b>because</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>they</b> would attract a goodness to themselves; {{but he made}} them in such kind, as to bring forth that goodness he before determined they should. [...] "And the evening and the morning were the sixth day." ...|$|R
25|$|Soon {{after the}} Sandinistas assumed power, the {{hierarchy}} began {{to oppose the}} Sandinistas government. The Archbishop was a vocal source of domestic opposition. The hierarchy was alleged to be motivated by fear {{of the emergence of}} the 'popular church' which challenged their centralized authority. The hierarchy also opposed social reforms implemented by the Sandinistas to aid the poor, allegedly <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it as a threat to their traditionally privileged position within society. In response to this perceived opposition, the Sandinistas shut down the church-run Radio Católica radio station on multiple occasions.|$|E
25|$|The two {{vehicles}} {{with the group}} of whites pulled off the freeway and into the motel parking lot. The group said they believed that Anderson was trying to steal a vehicle <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> him trying to break into one. The vehicle was Anderson's own; {{he had lost his}} keys. The group repeatedly beat Anderson and robbed him, the district attorney said, citing reports from witnesses. Video from a motel security camera shows the perpetrators entering and leaving the picture frame; it did not capture the beating. One witness reported that one of the perpetrators yelled, “white power,” when returning to his truck after the beating.|$|E
25|$|This {{conflict}} of authority {{resulted in a}} local power struggle in Upper Peru between 1808 and 1810 and constituted {{the first phase of}} the efforts to achieve independence. In 1808 the president of the audiencia, Ramón García León de Pizarro, demanded affiliation with the Junta Central. The conservative judges of the audiencia were influenced, however, by their autocratic royalist philosophy and refused to recognize the authority of the junta <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it as a product of a rebellion. On May 25, 1809, tensions grew when the radical criollos, refusing to recognize the junta because they wanted independence, took to the streets. This revolt, one of the first in Latin America, was soon put down by the authorities.|$|E
5000|$|Several US radio {{stations}} declined to broadcast the song <b>because</b> of what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as sacrilegious {{use of the}} words Christ and crucify in the chorus: Christ, you know it ain’t easy,You {{know how hard it}} can be,The way things are going,They’re gonna crucify me. [...] "The Ballad of John and Yoko" [...] never appeared on the surveys of WLS in Chicago or WABC in New York, two of the largest Top 40 stations in the US.|$|R
2500|$|Racists {{attacked}} {{rock and}} roll because of the mingling {{of black and white}} people it implied and achieved, and <b>because</b> of what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as black music's power to corrupt through vulgar and animalistic rhythms... The popularity of Elvis Presley was similarly founded on his transgressive position with respect to racial and sexual boundaries... White cover versions of hits by black musicians ... often outsold the originals; it seems that many Americans wanted black music without the black people in it.|$|R
40|$|A booklet of mapped {{surfaces}} of some Apollo 14 samples was prepared {{as an intermediate}} step towards the preparation of a new Apollo 14 sample catalog. It contains recently obtained observations and pictures {{of some of the}} largest and less well documented Apollo breccia samples. Some of the samples (14303, 14305, 14306, and 14311) were chosen <b>because</b> <b>they</b> have large <b>sawn</b> surfaces. These were dusted and mapped using a binocular microscope through the window of the nitrogen cabinet...|$|R
25|$|On March 10, 1785, King Charles III of Spain {{confirmed}} {{the establishment of}} the Royal Philippine Company with a 25-year charter. The Basque-based company was granted a monopoly on the importation of Chinese and Indian goods into the Philippines, as well as the shipping of the goods directly to Spain via the Cape of Good Hope. The Dutch and British bitterly opposed them <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the company as a direct attack on their Asian trade. It also faced the hostility of the traders of the Galleon trade (see above) who saw it as competition. This gradually resulted in the death of both institutions: The Royal Philippine Company in 1814 and the Galleon trade in 1815.|$|E
25|$|Torres's hope of placating {{conservative}} opposition {{by avoiding}} radical change {{did not win}} him {{the support of the}} right, especially of the powerful business community. Conservative groups unified in their opposition <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> a chance for a political comeback in alliance with rightist officers. The military, in turn, became increasingly polarized because of their discontent with Torres's chaotic leadership. Torres had cut the defense budget to free money for education and allowed civilian interference in strictly military matters. He often permitted military disobedience to go unpunished. The last step of institutional decay was a manifesto written during the last weeks of the Torres regime by a group of junior officers who questioned military authority. It resulted in widespread military support for the coup on August 21, 1971, by Colonel Hugo Banzer Suárez, the former Military Academy commander whom Torres had exiled.|$|E
25|$|Decades {{after his}} death, the Nazis {{strongly}} approved of Bruckner's music <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> it as expressing the zeitgeist of the German volk, and Hitler even consecrated {{a bust of}} Bruckner in a widely photographed ceremony in 1937 at Regensburg's Walhalla temple. Bruckner's music {{was among the most}} popular in Nazi Germany and the Adagio from his Seventh Symphony was broadcast by German radio (Deutscher Reichsrundfunk) when it broadcast the news of Hitler's death on 1 May 1945. However, this did not hurt Bruckner's standing in the postwar media, and several movies and TV productions in Europe and the United States have used excerpts from his music ever since the 1950s, as they already did in the 1930s. Nor did the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra ever ban Bruckner's music as they have Wagner's, even recording the Eighth Symphony with Zubin Mehta.|$|E
5000|$|The first European land {{exploration}} of Alta California, the Spanish Portolà expedition, camped {{near the river}} for two nights, {{in the vicinity of}} today's community of Pajaro, on October 8-9, 1769. The party continued north the next day toward Santa Cruz. Expedition soldiers called it [...] "Pajaro" [...] (meaning [...] "bird" [...] in Spanish) <b>because</b> the natives <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> there had a large stuffed bird. Franciscan missionary Juan Crespi, traveling with the expedition, noted in his diary that, [...] "to some of our party it looked like a royal eagle" [...] (possibly an osprey).|$|R

2500|$|When the First World War {{broke out}} in 1914, the Young Afghan {{political}} movement, headed by journalist Mahmud Tarzi and Habibullah's son Amanullah, advocated that Afghanistan enter the war on the German-Turkish side, in direct opposition to Britain. In this they {{had the support of}} Nasrullah and the religious factions he represented, who were sympathetic towards the Ottomans <b>because</b> of what <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> as unwarranted infidel aggression towards Islamic states. [...] Despite this, the Emir Habibullah Khan judged Afghanistan too poor and weak to realistically take part in the war, and declared Afghanistan's neutrality, to the frustration of Nasrullah and the Young Afghans.|$|R
25|$|The {{system was}} set up as such by the Fathers of Confederation <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> such a use of {{constitutional}} monarchy as a bulwark against any fracturing of the Canadian federation. In 1939, Sir Shuldham Redfern, then Secretary to the Governor General, said that, without a common allegiance to the Crown, the regions of Canada might break up. The British North America Act, 1867 (now the Constitution Act, 1867), was written so as to reflect the view of John A. Macdonald and the Earl of Derby that the provinces were subordinate to the federal Crown, with the lieutenant governors appointed by the governor general and not—as is done with the governors of the Australian states and was suggested be integrated in Canada by the 1979 Task Force on National Unity—by the Queen herself. Further, while the lieutenant governors did each hold a great seal, summoned and prorogued parliament in the Queen's stead, and granted Royal Assent to bills that bore the Queen's name, it was still expected that the latter be given {{in the name of}} the governor general.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, {{a promotional}} video which showed SpongeBob {{along with other}} {{characters}} from children's shows singing together to promote diversity and tolerance, was criticized by a Christian evangelical group in the United States <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> the character SpongeBob being used as an advocate for homosexuality though the video contained [...] "no reference to sex, sexual lifestyle or sexual identity." [...] James Dobson of Focus on the Family accused the makers of the video of promoting homosexuality due to a gay rights group sponsoring the video.|$|E
500|$|Police {{said the}} first {{responders}} decided not to engage <b>because</b> <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> civilians lying and sitting {{in the line of}} fire between them and the perpetrator; they didn't know their status, and the perpetrator had taken cover behind a bar with only his head and hand holding the pistol visible. According to the Chief of the Zlín Regional Police Department, , the Uherský Brod district units present had enough manpower and equipment, including select-fire rifles, to engage [...] However, they decided to withdraw due to the perpetrator's claim of having hostages and stated intent to negotiate their release.|$|E
50|$|Although {{no group}} {{admitted}} responsibility for her disappearance, there were rumours that the IRA had killed her {{for being an}} informer. Another rumour {{is that she was}} killed <b>because</b> neighbours claimed <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> her helping a badly wounded British soldier outside her home; however, there is no record of such an incident. McConville's children say they recall her helping a wounded British soldier some time before their father died in January 1972. In a 2014 interview published in the Sunday Life, veteran republican Evelyn Gilroy claimed the person who had tended to the soldier was her Gilroy's sister.|$|R
