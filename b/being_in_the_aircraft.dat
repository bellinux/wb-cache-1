The paper will describe the capabilities of these systems and their current state of development. A brief description of initial research applications is included. The wide (40 X 60 degree) field-of-view HMD system has been provided by Kaiser Electronics. It can be configured as a monochromatic system for use in bright daylight conditions, a two color system for darker ambients, or a full color system for use in night viewing conditions. Color imagery is achieved using field sequential video and a mechanical color wheel. <b>In</b> addition to <b>the</b> color symbology, high resolution computer-gene rated imagery from an onboard Silicon Graphics Reality Engine Onyx processor is available for research in virtual reality applications. This synthetic imagery can also be merged with real world video {{from a variety of}} imaging systems that can be installed easily {{on the front of the}} helicopter. These sensors include infrared or tv cameras, or potentially small millimeter wave radars. The Research Flight Control System is being developed for <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> by a team of contractors led by Boeing Helicopters. It consists of a full authority high bandwidth fly-by-wire actuators that drive the main rotor swashplate actuators and the tail rotor actuator in parallel. This arrangement allows the basic mechanical flight control system of the Black Hawk to be retained so that the safety pilot can monitor the operation of the system through the action of his own controls. The evaluation pilot will signal the fly-by-wire actuators through the flight computer from electrical sidearm controllers located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right hand cockpit. The system will have very substantial input/output capacity and impressive computational power. These systems are installed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> using predominantly a MIL-STD 1553 B data bus architecture. Sensor data from the RFCS, <b>the</b> basic <b>aircraft</b> and rotor system instrumentation including navigation information, and the HMD system are easily exchanged among user systems, or are available at the systems operator station located <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cabin for real time monitoring or data recording...|$|R
40|$|Laminated {{composites}} is {{a material}} that is rapidly <b>being</b> adapted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> industry and new joining techniques are being researched for new structural designs. One such technique is adhesive bonding, which can result in decreased weight, fuel saving and improved strength of aircraft components. Robust strength and failure analysis methods are required to assess new designs beforehand. One of these methods is co-hesive zone modelling. Cohesive zone modelling is a technique based on cohesive forces and energy within a material or interface region which keeps material together. Damage can be tracked progressively along a region with cohesive elements and damage propagation can be monitored in a structure. This thesis work relies on cohesive zone modelling to monitor damage propagation of <b>the</b> bondline and <b>in</b> between plies of simple bonded joints, together with progressive failure criteria to assess any failure within the plies of a joint. A composite Cracked Lap Shear (CLS) specimen was tested with results of a possible crack jump from bondline to adherend. The objective of this thesis was to assess and recreate damage propagation {{and the possibility of}} a jumpof damage growth frombondline to adherend in theCLS specimen. Thiswas done by us-ing cohesive zone modelling and progressive failure criteriawith the finite element package MSC. Mentat and its solver MSC. Marc. A validation with another test report on mixed-mode bending and interlaminar failure was performed using a cohesive zone model with the settings MSC. Marc has to offer. This wielded accurate results in terms of loading and damage. With the aid of this validation, the options within the cohesive zone model which had <b>the</b> best results <b>in</b> <b>the</b> validation were used for simulations of the CLS specimen. Cohesive zone elements representing the bondline and the adhesive within <b>the</b> laminate adherends <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CLS model are used to assess cohesive and interlaminar failure, while progressive failure criteria are used to assess in-tralaminar failure. The results of the current simulation setupswere unsatisfying as the failure load and strain results had large errors. Further detailed analyses will be needed to recreate the multiple failure modes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> CLS specimen <b>in</b> MSC. Marc with acceptable results. On the other hand, the thesis has proven that MSC. Marc and its own cohesive zone model perform well enough for mixed-mode bending and interlaminar failure in simple geometries.

40|$|Stockholms vattenskärning AB in Kungsängen has {{through the}} {{acquisition}} of a company begun to design and produce aircraft heaters whose origin is early 1970 s which follows a high inefficiency in terms of energy consumption and size. <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> heater, which is sold worldwide, serves its purpose for customer satisfaction and has done so ever since it was developed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 70 s. Stockholms vattenskärning AB is now investigating <b>the</b> possibility <b>in</b> making <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> heaters more efficient, {{both in terms of}} energy consumption but also on a more efficient design with the belief that it would lead them to an edge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> market.   <b>The</b> <b>aircraft</b> heater consists of several main components whose function altogether is to keep passenger aircrafts warm while they are on the ground. This project has been limited to the further development of the heat exchanger package which accounts for the conversion of the hot medium to the fresh air <b>being</b> carried <b>in</b> to <b>the</b> <b>aircraft</b> cabin.   Work has been divided into different phases {{in order to create a}} better understanding of the project range and to make it easier to divide <b>the</b> various elements <b>in</b> <b>the</b> time available, 10 weeks. These phases are literature review, situation analysis, concept generation, CAD, concept comparison and writing reports. After the initial literature review was made, a fundamental theory was written which is essential <b>in</b> understanding <b>the</b> remaining parts of the project. With the theoretical part as support, measurements and calculations were made on the current heat exchange package in a situation analysis to ensure its operation and efficiency. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> concept generation phase, the collected facts from the literature review was used as the basis for creating a matrix. The purpose of the matrix was to indicate the two most suitable types of heat exchangers to develop four new concepts out of. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> CAD phase the four concepts was drawn up and then described with text and images. The last phase is the concept comparison where a concept selection matrix is used to function as a decision basis for further production at Stockholms vattenskärning AB.   The four concepts have been developed based on the current heat exchanger and is gradually changed into a design of a cross-flow heat exchanger constructed out of stainless sections. The purpose of this is to have gradual upgrading of the heat exchanger as an option, in order not to saturate the market...|$|R
