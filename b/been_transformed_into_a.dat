5|$|Somewhat later, andesitic lavas {{poured out}} {{from what is}} now Reading Peak and mainly flowed {{to the south and}} east, {{reaching}} the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit the park on the east. Taken together, these various flows built the lava plateau that the Lassen volcanic area is located on.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, the two {{follow the}} cloud to a castle. There, the cloud {{condenses}} into a demonic form, presumably Hunson Abadeer. While {{running through the}} castle, Finn and Jake find a portal back to Ooo, and the two jump in, with Abadeer in pursuit. Finn wounds the demon with his sword. At that moment it is revealed that the demon is not Hunson Abadeer, but rather Marceline, who has for some unknown reason, <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> hideous demon. She musters enough strength to forbid Finn and Jake from {{coming back to the}} Nightosphere, and, after the two are teleported back to their dimension, she closes the portal.|$|E

5|$|Just {{across the}} town line, NY33A intersects {{the east end}} of the Airport Expressway (NY204). At this point, NY204 leaves the highway and turns to follow NY33A eastward. While most of NY33A west of Gates is a two-lane highway, the portion of Chili Avenue that carries both NY33A and NY204 is a four-lane roadway. The two routes soon enter Tressmar, a hamlet that has <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> major {{commercial}} destination. The development is mostly centered on Westgate Plaza, a large shopping plaza anchored by a Walmart. As NY33A passes south of the plaza, it connects to Howard Road (unsigned NY940L and formerly part of NY47) and Brooks Avenue. NY204 leaves NY33A at Brooks Avenue to follow the road eastward toward the Greater Rochester International Airport.|$|E
5|$|On 12 October 1917, the 34th Battalion—as {{a member}} of the 9th Brigade—was {{to take part in the}} 3rd Australian Division's attack on Passchendaele, Belgium. Subject to several days of heavy rain, the {{battlefield}} had <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> boggy marsh on which the attack was to commence. Jeffries commanded B Company during the attack, which he halted at the entrance to Broodseinde railway cutting, as many of the direction tapes leading to the starting position had been destroyed or swallowed up by the mud. To avoid any mishaps, Jeffries and another of the battalion's company commanders, Captain T.G. Gilder, pushed on alone as far as Keerselaarhoek cemetery to find the tapes marking the battalions starting line for the attack. Thus, by 03:00 the 34th Battalion was formed up on the line of attack.|$|E
5|$|Raziel has <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> possum by Bavmorda, and Willow and {{his party}} return with her to shore.

Willow tries to restore Raziel, but turns her into a rook instead. Madmartigan is dosed with love dust by the brownies and declares his undying love for Sorsha. The prisoners escape and reach a village {{at the foot of}} a mountain, where they again encounter Airk and the remains of his army, recently defeated by Bavmorda's forces. Madmartigan proclaims his loyalty to the Nelwyn and promises to protect Willow and Elora.|$|E

5|$|Rebecca Lansing, a TriOptimum {{counter-terrorism}} consultant, contacts {{the player}} and claims that Citadel Station's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth. SHODAN's {{plan is to}} destroy all major cities on the planet, {{in a bid to}} become a kind of god. Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser, and promises to destroy the records of the hacker's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped. With information gleaned from log discs, the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station's own shields. Foiled by the hacker's work, SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus—the same one responsible for turning the station's crew into mutants. The hacker, while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus, confronts and defeats Diego, who has <b>been</b> <b>transformed</b> <b>into</b> <b>a</b> powerful cyborg by SHODAN. Next, SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth's computer networks. Following Rebecca's advice, the hacker prevents the download's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data.|$|E
