5|$|Soon the PNHQ {{deployed}} {{rescue teams}} on patrol vessels {{to recover the}} survivors of Khaibar. As Muhafiz sank <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> transmit, the Pakistanis knew the fate of ship from its few survivors, who were recovered when the patrol vessel steered towards the ship's burning flotsam.|$|E
5|$|While Delrina {{lost the}} court case, the {{publicity}} it generated was substantial, with coverage {{in over a}} thousand newspapers across North America, resulting in consumers turning out in droves to buy the offending program <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be recalled.|$|E

50|$|The IBM 704 reordered the BCDIC code {{to allow}} a normal {{alphabetic}} collating order internally, with 0 before 1 and A <b>before</b> Z. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> automatically translate between this internal form and the earlier BCDIC when reading and writing magnetic tapes.|$|R
5|$|Written by Philip Martin, {{this story}} was {{submitted}} on 28 December 1983 and had the Doctor travel into the Egyptian underworld to save Peri. On 9 March 1984 Saward felt that the story idea needed further work <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be considered for commissioning.|$|E
5|$|An {{analysis}} by British staff {{officers of the}} initial period of the Normandy campaign found that 7% of all German tanks destroyed by British forces were knocked out by PIATs, compared to 6% by rockets fired by aircraft. However, {{they also found that}} once German tanks had been fitted with armoured skirts that detonated hollow-charge ammunition <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> penetrate the tank's armour, the weapon became much less effective.|$|E
5|$|Both Allied and Japanese {{naval forces}} {{continued}} to converge on 22 August {{and both sides}} conducted intense aircraft scouting efforts, however neither side spotted its adversary. The disappearance {{of at least one}} of their scouting aircraft (shot down by aircraft from Enterprise <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> send a radio report), caused the Japanese to strongly suspect that U.S. carriers were in the immediate area. The U.S., however, was unaware of the disposition and strength of approaching Japanese surface warship forces.|$|E
6000|$|This {{view of life}} he hurled {{at her as if}} it were an {{offensive}} missile. It stunned her. She felt she must fly <b>before</b> <b>it</b> and <b>could</b> no longer do so. She did not think for one moment what interpretation he might put upon the word [...] "lover." ...|$|R

60|$|We had parted {{one night}} as usual. No word {{had fallen from}} my lips, at that time or at any time <b>before</b> <b>it,</b> that <b>could</b> betray me, or startle her into sudden {{knowledge}} of the truth. But when we met again in the morning, a change had come over her--a change that told me all.|$|R
5|$|In 1807 Agamemnon {{was part}} of Admiral James Gambier's fleet sent {{to take control of}} the Danish fleet <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> fall into French hands. She participated in the second Battle of Copenhagen, and as in the first in 1801, ran aground. After she had come free, Agamemnon landed guns and shot in Kjörge Bay to form part of a battery being {{established}} there to command the city. Firing commenced on 2 September, and lasted until the Danes surrendered on 7 September. In November, Agamemnon joined the blockading squadron off Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|In early November, the 13th Brigade began readying {{itself for}} {{an attack on the}} Hindenburg Line with the {{division}}, which was part of the Second Army. The division launched a reconnaissance in force on the Voëvre Plain, but <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> begin a full assault, the Allies signed an Armistice ending hostilities. After 33 days on the front lines, the 7th Division suffered 1,988 casualties. It was awarded one campaign streamer for Lorraine. The brigade performed occupation duties for the next year as it began preparations to return to the continental United States.|$|E
5|$|Kripke was {{developing}} the concept {{for ten years}} before it was greenlit as a television series. <b>Before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be filmed, the script underwent numerous revisions. The episode was produced in Los Angeles, though future episodes were filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, to save money. The episode established the series' tradition of a rock-music soundtrack, and included background music scored by Kripke's friend Christopher Lennertz. It received mixed reviews, with critics praising the horror elements but having varying opinions of the lead actors' performances.|$|E

50|$|The Kunukku {{could be}} {{impressed}} on clay over the stopper of an amphora of wine, for example; then allowed to dry <b>before</b> shipment. <b>It</b> <b>could</b> also be impressed over twine tying a door shut, thus indicating whether the premises had been entered. As a speculation, a Kunukku {{with the image}} of a god might be seen as invoking the god's protection.|$|R
5|$|Landing the {{aircraft}} required {{the extension of}} the retractable landing skid and the deployment of a braking drogue parachute. As pilots could access the plane only from a hatch above the cockpit, the pilot would have to enter the E.381 <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be attached to the carrier Ar 234C and had no way to escape in case of an emergency, while attached to the carrier.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, Arnold {{drew the}} British fleet to a {{position}} he had carefully chosen to limit their advantages. In the battle that followed, many of the American ships were damaged or destroyed. That night, Arnold sneaked the American fleet past the British one, beginning a retreat toward Crown Point and Ticonderoga. Unfavorable weather hampered the American retreat, {{and more of the}} fleet was either captured or grounded and burned <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> reach Crown Point. Upon reaching Crown Point Arnold had the fort's buildings burned and retreated to Ticonderoga.|$|E
5|$|The Allied forces around Okinawa {{braced for}} an assault. Admiral Raymond Spruance ordered six battleships already engaged in shore {{bombardment}} in the sector {{to prepare for}} surface action against Yamato. These orders were countermanded in favor of strikes from Admiral Marc Mitscher's aircraft carriers, but as a contingency the battleships together with seven cruisers and 21 destroyers were sent to interdict the Japanese force <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> reach the vulnerable transports and landing craft.|$|E
50|$|The {{decision}} of the Court of Claims in regard to item (1) was that the claimants had not shown that the written contract did not express the intent of both parties as to the coffer dams, and that even if that court were satisfied that the claimants executed the contract in mistake of their rights, {{there was no evidence}} that the defendants shared the mistake. Its decision in regard to item (2) was that it would be disposed to regard the case, on the facts, as one for equitable interposition for the purpose of further inquiry and the ascertainment of the rights of the parties in equity if it had jurisdiction, but that the statute did not authorize it to entertain those considerations, because, in the proceedings <b>before</b> <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> hear and determine only claims for labor done and materials furnished by the claimants under their contract with the defendants.|$|R

5|$|The CSBS and the {{improved}} version, the Mk. X were insufficient, as both were {{too large to}} easily stabilize. Because {{of the way it}} was built, the Automatic Bomb Sight could be equipped with a stabilizer but it was estimated that it would be some time <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be modified and brought into production. The Norden did offer stabilization but it also required relatively long setup times and was still not available for purchase.|$|E
5|$|The Central Pacific Hurricane Center retired {{the name}} Iwa {{subsequent}} to the storm {{and replaced it with}} Io. However, in 2007 the CPHC revised the four rotating lists of tropical cyclone names and replaced the name Io with Iona <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be used. Iwa was the first retired hurricane in the Central Pacific since the modern system of using Hawaiian naming began in the early 1980s, and it remains one of only four to be retired as of 2015.|$|E
5|$|The Mega Man series from Archie Comics went on hiatus <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{reach an}} {{adaptation}} of Mega Man 5, but some characters and elements from the game were foreshadowed. In particular, the final issue saw Dr. Light experience {{a vision of the}} events of this game, noting that it seemed as thought Proto Man were attacking but that something seemed wrong.|$|E
60|$|But {{it was too}} late. He was in <b>it</b> <b>before</b> I <b>could</b> {{stop him}} and down he went--I never saw a chair shivered so in my life.|$|R
30|$|Although more {{patients}} in GC group received chemoprophylaxis <b>before</b> surgery, <b>it</b> <b>could</b> {{not affect the}} postoperative VTE rate as the patients diagnosed VTE were excluded from this study. And the multivariate analysis confirmed its influence was limited. Considering the different proportion of mechanical thromboprophylaxis in different groups, we compared the VTE rate during hospitalization prior to discharge. The results revealed that {{no significant differences were}} detected during this period, when the mechanical devices were applied.|$|R
60|$|Bill sighed. He {{had never}} dreamed <b>before</b> that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be so {{difficult}} to give money away. He was profoundly glad {{that he had not}} revealed his identity, as he had been on the very point of doing just when she began her remarks. He understood now why that curt refusal had come in answer to his lawyer's letter. Well, {{there was nothing to do}} but wait and hope that time might accomplish something.|$|R
5|$|The {{aircraft}} was assigned the airport's runway 22 for the takeoff, but used runway 26 instead. Runway 26 {{was too short}} for a safe takeoff, causing the aircraft to overrun {{the end of the}} runway <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> become airborne. It crashed just past the end of the runway, killing all 47 passengers and two of the three crew. The flight's first officer was the only survivor.|$|E
5|$|The brigade {{was then}} sent to India as the division's advance party, but the war ended <b>before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> begin operations. Instead the brigade became {{involved}} in disarming the Japanese forces in Malaya and Singapore, to restore British sovereignty. Its last operation was in Java, where it remained until a Dutch force arrived to take over. The brigade then rejoined the 6th Airborne Division, which was serving in Palestine, but was disbanded almost immediately afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The gun was a {{traditional}} muzzleloader; {{it needed to}} be loaded {{from the end of the}} barrel. <b>Before</b> <b>it</b> <b>could</b> be loaded the bore of the barrel was cleaned with a sponge, after which a propellant charge (gunpowder in a cloth bag) was rammed down into the breech. This was followed by a projectile, often encased in wadding. The gun was primed (using a metal spike inserted through the vent that pierced the charge), and fired using a percussion cap (which ignited the charge and forced the projectile out of the barrel).|$|E
60|$|Tom's {{behavior}} at home had been perfect {{during the entire}} week. His uncle and aunt had seen nothing like <b>it</b> <b>before.</b> They <b>could</b> find no fault with him anywhere.|$|R
6000|$|Grace {{went and}} touched his hand; shook <b>it</b> <b>before</b> she <b>could</b> arouse him. He moved, started, opened his eyes, and exclaimed, [...] "Ah, Felice!...Oh, <b>it's</b> Grace. I <b>could</b> not see in the gloom. What--am I in the saddle?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Previously, the {{licensing}} process had two steps, a construction permit and an operating license, {{each of which}} required a different application to be filed and reviewed. Oppositions raised before a plant started operation versus <b>before</b> <b>it</b> started construction <b>could</b> thus be extremely financially damaging to a utility.|$|R
