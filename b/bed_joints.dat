40|$|Cracking is {{responsible}} {{for the vast majority of}} masonry non-linear behaviour, due to the low tensile strength of the material. Masonry features orthotropic behaviour with material axes normal and parallel to the <b>bed</b> <b>joints,</b> being the response straightforward for tension normal to the <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> and rather complex for tension parallel to the <b>bed</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper addresses the formulation and implementation of coupling between a micro-mechanical homogenisation model and an isotropic damage model for the masonry components. The non-linear homogenisation formulation requires an improved internal deformation mode of the masonry basic cell, with respect to previous works. Finally, the model is validated with a comparison with numerical results available in the literature, using interface modelling...|$|E

40|$|Masonry walls enclose {{rooms in}} {{buildings}} {{and may have}} a load bearing function. Load bearing walls not only transfer vertical loads but also horizontal (wind or seismic) loads. Masonry walls are usually bonded at their vertical intersection forming T or H shaped sections. In this vertical intersection, shear is an important design parameter. A standardized test {{for this type of}} shear is not available. Usually, the triplet shear test is applied. However, the triplet test is only intended to establish the initial shear strength of <b>bed</b> <b>joints.</b> Other tests in which shear and pre compression are applied in <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> are the diagonal tension test and the compression wallette tests with inclined <b>bed</b> <b>joints.</b> In this paper research into the behavior of H shaped specimens loaded in shear is discussed. The specimens, 500 mm high and 550 mm long, were made from calcium silicate units with thin <b>bed</b> <b>joints.</b> Their dimension was roughly at a 1 : 5 scale, i. e. wall thickness was 50 mm compared to wall thickness in buildings up to 300 mm. Two different support conditions were applied. Results are compared with diagonal tension tests on masonry simultaneously made from the same materials, results from literature, push over tests on real sized walls and results from numerical simulations. The more confined specimens resulted in higher ultimate loads. The deformation measurements indicated the effects of local cracking...|$|E
40|$|Compression {{parallel}} to the <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> occurs due to flexure in masonry beam elements. Currently, {{it is believed that}} there is a reduction in the compressive strength of masonry when it is loaded {{parallel to}} the <b>bed</b> <b>joint.</b> It is also believed that this reduction is larger when the webs of the blocks are present in the compression zone, causing an interruption in the grout. This study was undertaken to investigate the effect of loading {{parallel to the}} <b>bed</b> <b>joint,</b> as well as web interruption, on the concrete masonry compressive strength. A detailed experimental study using 29 prism and 12 beam specimens was completed.

40|$|Extensive {{experimental}} research aimed at defining the in-plane cyclic behavior of {{three types of}} load-bearing masonry walls, assembled with perforated clay units, and various types of head and <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> was carried out.

The procedures adopted for model calibration established the reliability of various modeling strategies.

40|$|AbstractThe article {{presents}} some results of experimental tests on solid clay brick masonry wallets ca. 130 × 140 cm subjected to simultaneously shearing {{perpendicular to the}} <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> and vertical compression. Angular distortions and shear stiffness were calculated based on measured strains of masonry and applied shear forces. The {{purpose of the study}} was to examine how the angular distortion depends on the shear stress and how the masonry shear stiffness changes with load increasing. The impact of the value of compressive stress perpendicular to the <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> on shear stiffness was also tested. The results of investigations showed that relationship between the shear stresses and the angles of distortion were quite linear for shear stresses from 0 to τcr (τcr – shear stress accompanying first diagonal cracking). The τ-θ relationship was nonlinear after diagonal cracking. Distinctive hardening (increase of shear stresses) of cracked masonry was evident for the specimens simultaneously sheared and compressed. The hardening was stronger when the specimens were strongly compressed...|$|E

All tests were conducted in accordance with relevant standard procedures. Flexural bond strengths, with planes of failure parallel and perpendicular to <b>bed</b> <b>joints,</b> were determined by panel (wallette) tests. Bond wrench testing of stack-bonded prisms was also conducted to investigate further the material influences on flexural strength. The main parameters studied in this investigation were mortar mix design (binder : aggregate ratio; lime grade) and brick water absorption characteristics. The flexural bond strength and initial shear strength of the brickwork in general increased with mortar strength, but flexural bond strength was significantly impaired by both low and high brick water absorption.

The effort is due to an excessive deformation of the structural elements. The small walls of ceramic blocks (named here mini-walls) were analyzed under two different situations: without <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> reinforcement (for reference) and with <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> reinforcement. In order to evaluate the improvement of structural performance with the proposed strengthening (reinforcement masonry walls) the arrows were measured {{in the middle of}} the mini-walls, cracking degree and the steel bars deformation. The program employed to carry out the numerical analyses was DIANA (version 9. 1), that uses Finet Element Method (FEM). The strategy adopted was macromodelling and non linear phisical behaviour. The results obtained from the numerical research proved that masonry walls with <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> showed an increased load at first cracking, better performance in service, increased capacity and more resistant arrow at break.

40|$|Massive masonry {{structures}} can {{be subjected}} to critical compressive conditions due to high dead loads. Under those loads, a typical damaging phenomenon, characterized by diffused thin vertical cracks, develops. The evolution of this phenomenon can be suitably counteracted by {{the application of the}} <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> reinforcement technique, which consists in embedding reinforcing bars within the mortar <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> of brick masonry.

40|$|Caribbean-style hybrid concrete-masonry {{structures}} {{consist of}} a reinforced concrete frame with partially grouted and reinforced infill masonry walls. The infill walls are typically connected to the RC frame with cast-in-place dowel reinforcement along one or more edges of the wall. There is limited guidance in masonry codes to design these types of structures, and their seismic performance has not been characterized with experimental tests. In this work, an experimental program characterized the seismic behavior of hybrid concrete-masonry frames and showed they do not exhibit the typical strut mechanism observed in unreinforced masonry infill structures. In addition, a detailed finite element modeling scheme and calibration methodology was developed for modeling partially grouted masonry.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} how the rules in EN 1996 - 1 - 1 Eurocode 6 : 'Design of masonry structures ' can be implemented and used to verify the safety of load-bearing unreinforced masonry walls. The implementation described {{is based on a}} plastic (calculation) model of the walls assuming that the tensile strength of masonry perpendicular to <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> is zero. Using a plastic model makes it natural to replace the specification of the eccentricity of the vertical load on the wall, which defines the point where the vertical load acts, with an eccentricity interval specifying all the points where the vertical load can be transferred to the wall. For walls subjected to mainly vertical loading, a beam model of the wall is used. For walls subjected to mainly lateral loading, a modified yield-line model is used. The main problem of the approach described is the determination of the eccentricity intervals. A more accurate determination of these eccentricities than given in this paper requires more research into the behaviour of the joints between walls and floors either experimentally or by means of an advanced finite element program that takes cracking in the <b>bed</b> <b>joints</b> into account...|$|E

Results for two ratios of flow discharge are represented. Results are in agreement with earlier studies and it is shown that the change of the channel crossing angle affects the flow pattern in the main channel and also that the dimensions of the created separation zone in the main channel become larger when the crossing angle increases.

This will significantly reduce the amount of work needed and the retrofitting costs. A dose-response model for prediction of corrosion induced cracking in reinforced brick masonry is presented, with relative humidity, temperature and oxygen supply {{in the vicinity of the}} reinforcement as influencing parameters. Corrosion depth, constituting the dose, is modelled by integration of the effect of corrosion rate with respect to time. To describe the dependence of corrosion rate on the influencing parameters, models from the field of concrete research are used. The response, which can be seen as a limit state, is the corrosion depth required to create a crack due to tensile stresses generated by corrosion products. Due to scarcity of experimental data from the field of reinforced brick masonry, the critical corrosion depth is established using empirical data from the field of concrete research. To address this lack of a well-defined limit state, tests will be performed on clay brick specimens in a later part of the research project.

40|$|Layered limestones with marly-clayey interbeds are {{widespread}} in mountain regions. Where tectonics {{has not changed}} the original structure they frequently form homocline slopes, that since the last deglaciation have evolved through planar block slides along <b>bedding</b> <b>joints.</b> A typical dip slope showing this evolution {{is represented by the}} left flank of the Adige River valley south of Rovereto (North-Eastern Italy). Even though layers never daylight at the slope toe, the exceptional persistence and weakness of <b>bedding</b> <b>joints</b> allows buckling of layers, which occasionally collapse causing rock avalanches. Before monitoring started, deformations were believed to be no longer active, this conviction being strengthened by the high safety factors provided by limit equilibrium analyses. SAR satellite interferometry performed between 1990 and 2002 and probe inclinometer measures indicate that the slabs located uphill from the buckle folds are slowly sliding. Since some doubts have been raised about rock mass behaviour, slope geometry and hydraulic conditions assumed in the analyses, buckling was back-analysed using the Distinct Element Method (DEM) and the Discontinuous Deformation Analysis (DDA). These treat the rock mass as a discontinuum and account for deformation and failure of the rock material. To perform numerical analyses, rock mass structure, strength and stiffness were determined through extensive in situ and laboratory investigations. For this purpose field surveys, borehole core logging and geophysical surveys were performed and laboratory geotechnical tests on the rock material, clayey interbeds and <b>bedding</b> <b>joints</b> were conducted. Discontinuous analyses confirmed that buckling deformations are definitely possible if some conditions are present (high water pressure, minor flexures). Modelling also indicate that buckling deformations may evolve into failures and should therefore be taken into account in evaluating long term stability of the slope. © 2009 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study on}} the shear load-displacement behavior of horizontal joints in unreinforced brick masonry subjected to constant compression. In general, under static shear loading masonry joints show a peak shear stress followed by a residual shear strength. To investigate these aspects in greater detail, triplet tests were conducted on masonry specimens using different types of mortar. The results found in this study and previous tests show that normal compressive stresses acting on the interface and the interface mortar strength affect the peak shear stress and the residual strength in a rather similar way. The cohesion and the internal friction angle, i. e., the two parameters required by the Mohr-Coulomb criterion, are then derived from a linear regression of the test results. The pre-peak and post-peak response of a masonry <b>bed</b> <b>joint</b> can best be represented by simple equations, and their shear stiffness depends on material properties and the magnitude of the normal compression.
