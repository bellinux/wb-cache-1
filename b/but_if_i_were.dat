500|$|The 1921 and 1922 teams {{also claimed}} SIAA titles. The 1921 team {{suffered}} its only loss to undefeated, eastern power Penn State. Tech was captained by fullback Judy Harlan. Future Tech fullback Sam Murray {{was asked about}} a certain strong runner in the 1930s, [...] "He's good. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> playing again, I would have one wish [...] never to see earing down upon me a more fearsome picture of power than Judy Harlan blocking for Red Barron." [...] Barron ran for 1,459 yards on the season.|$|E
500|$|A third Dooley collection, Mr. Dooley's Philosophy, {{appeared}} in 1900. The lead story was [...] "A Book Review", that is, Mr. Dooley's discussion of New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt's wartime memoir, The Rough Riders. In Mr. Dooley's version, Roosevelt wins the whole war by himself, a role slightly {{greater than that}} in his actual book. Dooley's conclusion: [...] "No man that bears a grudge against himself'll ever be governor of a state. [...] And if Teddy done it all he ought to say so and relieve the suspense. [...] <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> him I'd call the book Alone in Cuba." [...] Somewhat to Dunne's surprise, [...] "Rosenfelt" [...] (as Dooley called him) took the sting in good humor, and when the two met, told Dunne of a young female admirer of his, who told the governor that she had read all of his books, with her favorite Alone in Cuba. Roosevelt was elected vice president on McKinley's ticket in 1900, and when he succeeded after the president was assassinated the following year, Dunne wrote of the new chief executive, the youngest to hold that position, [...] "a man is... {{old enough to be}} president when he becomes president. If he ain't, it'll age him." ...|$|E
500|$|Hock Guan Teh of DVD Town said {{he enjoyed}} the episode, and {{although}} it does not contain the [...] "usual amount" [...] of The Simpsons humor, the [...] "rich character development itself makes this episode worth multiple viewings. However, anyone allergic to country music should give this one a pass!" [...] Bill Gibron of DVD Verdict thought the episode featured [...] "one of the best" [...] parodies the Simpsons writers have ever conceived, the parody of the country television series Hee-Haw called Ya-Hoo!: [...] "While one must give multiple kudos to Beverly D'Angelo for writing and performing her own witty hillbilly ditties, it's the twisted cornpone , with such stars as Big Shirtless Ron and Cappy Mae, that really propels this installment into comic heaven. Homer's sheepish response to Lurlene's advances shows just what a decent, family loving man he is." [...] A reviewer for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram called the episode [...] "heartwarming", and commented that The Simpsons [...] "once again shows that {{at the heart of}} this crazy family there is an abiding love." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said [...] "it's a pretty impossible question for a die-hard fan, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> forced at gunpoint to name my favorite episode ever, 'Colonel Homer' would probably be the first to leap to mind, if only for the pure joy that is 'Bagged Me a Homer'." ...|$|E

2500|$|Future Tech fullback Sam Murray {{said about}} a strong runner during the 1930s, [...] "He's good. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> playing again, I would have one wish – never to see bearing down upon me a more fearsome picture of power than Judy Harlan {{blocking}} for Red Barron." [...] In {{the line at}} either end were the brothers John and Al Staton. At guard was Oscar Davis, who (with Barron) was listed on an All-Tech Alexander-era team.|$|E

"Simcha has no {{credibility}} whatsoever," [...] says Joe Zias, who was {{the curator}} for anthropology and archeology at the Rockefeller Museum in Jerusalem from 1972 to 1997 and personally numbered the Talpiot ossuaries. [...] "He's pimping off the Bible … He got this guy Cameron, who made Titanic or something like that—what does this guy know about archeology? I am an archeologist, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> {{to write a book}} about brain surgery, you would say, 'Who is this guy?' People want signs and wonders. Projects like these make a mockery of the archeological profession." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not perfectly, sir; <b>but,</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not mistaken, it was {{something}} like this: you hoped you did not distrust the creature; for that would imply distrust of the Creator." ...|$|R
2500|$|In the May 11, 2016 Toronto Star {{article by}} Jacques Gallant cited above, public {{relations}} expert Martin Waxman {{spoke of a}} [...] "damning indictment" [...] of the CBC which included the following comment. [...] "Yes, they did their inquiry, <b>but</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> the CBC, I would think strongly about {{what is wrong with}} the culture and what they can do to repair it," [...] he said. [...] The Star also quoted employment lawyer Howard Levitt stating that [...] "harassment has not been fully addressed at the CBC" [...] in his estimation. Levitt called the Rubin report a [...] "whitewash" [...] and reiterated his suggestion that a federal commission should conduct a more detailed enquiry into workplace issues at the public broadcaster.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of the lead single, [...] "Russian Roulette", Harmony was aware of the mixed {{reaction}} from fans who had heard the track. He assured fans that the song was not fully representative {{to the rest of the}} album, though it reflected Rihanna's growth as an artist. In an interview with Rap-Up, Tricky Stewart announced that he had collaborated with The-Dream on the project. He described the album as a whole as [...] "uptempo and edgy", stating that the album is different from her past works. In February 2010, Rihanna expressed a positive opinion on the album, but commented that her future work would be less intense. She asserted, [...] "I really like the bottom, the grime of it. <b>But</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to combine that with more energetic, up-tempo pop records, then I think that would be a happy marriage. And that's where we'll probably go next". When asked what the most important song to her was, she stated that she doesn't have one, however, [...] "Fire Bomb" [...] and [...] "Cold Case Love" [...] were cited as her favorites.|$|E
