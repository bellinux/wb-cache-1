Transgenic mice that overexpress a dominant-negative mutation of the TGF- � type II receptor (DNIIR) {{under the control}} of a metallothionein-derived promoter (MT-DNIIR) were used to determine the role of endogenous TGF-�s in the developing mammary gland. The expression of the dominant-negative receptor was induced with zinc and was primarily localized to the stroma underlying the ductal epithelium in the mammary glands of virgin transgenic mice from two separate mouse lines. In MT-DNIIR virgin females treated with zinc, there was an increase in lateral branching of the ductal epithelium. We tested the hypothesis that expression of the dominant-negative receptor may alter expression of genes that are expressed in the stroma and regulated by TGF-�s, potentially resulting in the increased lateral branching seen in the MT-DNIIR mammary glands. The expression of hepatocyte growth factor mRNA was increased in mammary glands from transgenic animals relative to the wild-type controls, suggesting that this factor {{may play a role in}} TGF-�mediated regulation of lateral <b>branching.</b> <b>Loss</b> of responsiveness to TGF-�s in the mammary stroma resulted in increased branching in mammary epithelium, suggesting that TGF-�s play an important role in the stromal–epithelial interactions required for branching morphogenesis...|$|E

To address this, we developed methods to screen the Drosophila genome using RNA-interference (RNAi) on primary neural cells and present the results of the first full-genome RNAi screen in neurons. We used live-cell imaging and quantitative image analysis to characterize the morphological phenotypes of fluorescently labelled primary neurons and glia in response to RNAi-mediated gene knockdown. From the full genome screen, we focused our analysis on 104 evolutionarily conserved genes that when downregulated by RNAi, have morphological defects such as reduced axon extension, excessive <b>branching,</b> <b>loss</b> of fasciculation, and blebbing. To assist in the phenotypic analysis of the large data sets, we generated image analysis algorithms that could assess the statistical significance of the mutant phenotypes.

We have carefully investigated several possible sources of uncertainty that could affect the results of the horizontal branch modeling, stemming from uncertainties in both stellar model computations and the cluster properties such as heavy element abundances, reddening and age.

Refractive index changes of 4 x 10 - 3 were achieved by UV lamp bulk exposure which is sufficient for waveguide definition. The optimal energy fluence was also investigated by considering waveguide profile. The intrinsic loss of P(MMA/MAOEMA) is estimated theoretically and compared to the actual waveguide propagation losses that were measured to be - 1 dB/cm at 633 nm, 1054 nm and 1310 nm by the cut-back method. The loss at 800 nm was relatively lower than at 1310 nm and 1550 nm by taking white light absorption spectra.
