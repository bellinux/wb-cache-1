25|$|A fourth {{concessionnaire}} provides <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> to Casablanca.|$|E
25|$|The Act also {{modified}} {{the role of}} Water Boards, providing a clear legal definition of the functions of Water Boards and municipalities. Water Boards have historically been the only <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> providers. Municipalities were obliged to buy water through them. The Act allowed municipalities {{to develop their own}} <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply infrastructure or to buy <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> from providers other than Water Boards. Conversely it also allowed Water Boards to provide retail water services at the request of municipalities. Since the Act has been passed the capacity of both Water Boards and many water service providers has increased significantly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Bulk</b> <b>water</b> tariffs vary greatly. In 2011 {{the largest}} water board, Rand Water, charged Rand 3.97 (US$0.48) per cubic meter. The highest <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> tariff (Rand 9.11 or US$1.10 per cubic meter) was {{charged by the}} financially {{crippled}} Namakwa Water Board, while the lowest tariff (Rand 2.28 or US$0.28) was charged by the Pelladrift Water Board.|$|E
50|$|In 2011, New Haven {{passed a}} {{municipal}} spending ban including <b>bulk</b> bottled <b>water</b> dispensers.|$|R
40|$|Most {{properties}} of liquid water {{are determined by}} its hydrogen-bond network. Because forming an aqueous interface requires termination of this network, one might expect the molecular level {{properties of}} interfacial water to markedly differ from <b>water</b> in <b>bulk.</b> Intriguingly, much prior experimental and theoretical work has found that, {{from the perspective of}} their time-averaged structure and picosecond structural dynamics, hydrogen-bonded OH groups at an air/water interface behave the same as hydrogen-bonded OH groups in <b>bulk</b> liquid <b>water.</b> Here we report the first experimental observation of interfacial water’s libration (i. e. frustrated rotation). We find this mode has a frequency of 834 cm - 1, ≈ 165 cm - 1 higher than in <b>bulk</b> liquid <b>water</b> at the same temperature and similar to bulk ice. Because libration frequency is proportional to the stiffness of water's rotational potential, this increase suggests that one effect of terminating <b>bulk</b> <b>water's</b> hydrogen bonding network at the air/water interface is retarding rotation of water around intact hydrogen bonds. Because in <b>bulk</b> liquid <b>water</b> the libration {{plays a key role in}} stabilizing reaction intermediates and dissipating excess vibrational energy, the ability to probe this mode in interfacial water opens new perspectives on the kinetics of heterogeneous reactions at aqueous interfaces...|$|R
40|$|Bulk sea {{temperature}}, {{which is}} defined as the temperature of the top 1 metre of the sea, is a crucial variable used by climate modelling systems. Remote infrared devices, however, can measure only to a depth of 100 micrometres, due to water's high absorption of this optical bandwidth. The remotely measurable skin region of the ocean has a temperature which is on average cooler than the underlying <b>bulk</b> <b>waters</b> by 0. 5 o C...|$|R
25|$|A {{proposed}} {{alternative to}} desalination in the American Southwest is the commercial importation of <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> from water-rich areas either by oil tankers converted to water carriers, or pipelines. The idea is politically unpopular in Canada, where governments imposed trade barriers to <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> exports {{as a result}} of a North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) claim.|$|E
25|$|Responsibility {{for service}} {{provision}} is shared among various entities: The country's 231 municipalities {{are in charge}} of water distribution and sanitation either directly or indirectly through municipally owned enterprises or private companies; government-owned water boards {{are in charge of}} operating <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply infrastructure and some wastewater systems; and the Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority finances and develops dams and <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply infrastructure.|$|E
25|$|The {{establishment}} of <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> tariffs is currently {{one of the}} most emphasized pricing mechanisms in Brazil. However, the actual implementation of <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply tariffs varies by state. For example, in the State of Ceara, prices for industrial users are 60 times higher than those for municipal users, who in turn pay as much as 10 times as that paid by agricultural users.|$|E
50|$|A {{flexible}} barge is {{a fabric}} barge (non-rigid) for the transportation of <b>bulk</b> fresh <b>water</b> or other liquid bulk {{items such as}} chemicals or oil.|$|R
50|$|Fluff pulp (also called {{comminution}} pulp or fluffy pulp) {{is a type}} {{of chemical}} pulp made from long fibre softwoods. Important parameters for fluff pulp are <b>bulk</b> and <b>water</b> absorbency.|$|R
30|$|This {{involves}} {{the estimation of}} petrophysical parameters such as porosity, water saturation, hydrocarbon saturation, permeability, movable hydrocarbon index, <b>bulk</b> volume <b>water,</b> and residual oil saturation. Cross-plots of the estimated parameters were generated.|$|R
25|$|After {{independence}} in 1956 water distribution systems were nationalized {{and handed over}} to public companies in the major cities, the so-called Régies. The <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply system from the Oum Er-Rbia River to Casablanca remained {{in the hands of}} the private concessionnaire SMD. <b>Bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply in the rest of the country was entrusted to a new national water company created in 1972, the Office National de l'Eau Potable (ONEP).|$|E
25|$|Tariffs include <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> tariffs {{charged by}} water boards to {{municipalities}} and retail water tariffs charged by municipalities to users.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 {{the initial}} 50-year {{concession}} of SMD, {{a subsidiary of}} Lyonnaise, for <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply to Casablanca was renewed.|$|E
30|$|The bottom ash-based ceramic {{materials}} studied were characterised {{by measuring the}} <b>bulk</b> density, <b>water</b> absorption and compressive strength, and their results have been compared to a control mixture based solely on clay.|$|R
5000|$|Graham Atkinson: Chief Executive Officer Umgeni Water(1987-1996), a {{state-owned}} entity. It {{is one of}} Africa’s {{most successful}} organisations involved in water management, and is the largest supplier of <b>bulk</b> potable <b>water</b> in KwaZulu-Natal.|$|R
60|$|And what do {{you think}} the <b>bulk</b> of that <b>water</b> is when it assumes the vaporous condition? You see that cube [pointing to a cubic foot]. There, by its side, is a cubic inch, exactly the same shape as the cubic foot, and that <b>bulk</b> of <b>water</b> [the cubic inch] is {{sufficient}} to expand into that bulk [the cubic foot] of steam; and, on the contrary, the application of cold will contract that large quantity of steam into this small quantity of water.|$|R
25|$|Cost {{recovery}} {{is through the}} sale of <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> from TCTA to the Department of Water and Forestry, a government Ministry, which in turn sells the <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> {{to the city of}} Cape Town. This arrangement reduces the financial risk, since the national government has a better credit rating than the city of Cape Town. The Western Cape population contributed towards the project {{in the form of an}} annual increase in water tariffs of 2.5% between 1999 and 2009.|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} to use debt finance are BOTs {{which are a}} popular financing mechanism for water and wastewater treatment plants and <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply systems in China. Under BOTs, private entities undertake investments and recover their costs through fees for <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> sale or wastewater treatment charged to the utilities. While the local government or utilities are formally not indebted through a BOT, the charges for the services are de facto similar to debt service charges.|$|E
25|$|During the French Protectorate, {{beginning}} in 1912, {{water supply and}} sanitation in many large cities in Morocco were managed under a concession to the private company Société Marocaine de Distribution d'eau, de gaz et d'electricité (SMD). SMD, a consortium led by Lyonnaise des Eaux, provided services in Casablanca, Rabat, Salé, Tangiers and Meknes. Since 1950 SMD also managed a vital <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> transfer project: The supply of water from the Oum er-Rbia river to Casablanca. <b>Bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply to other cities that were not able to supply themselves from local water sources was a responsibility of a public company called Régie d'exploitation industrielle du protectorat (REIP) created in the early 1930s. The foundations for two important elements of today's water and sanitation sector - private concessions for water distribution in large cities and a national public company for <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply - were thus already laid during the protectorate.|$|E
40|$|Atmospheric {{large and}} giant aerosol {{particles}} collected at Syowa Station, Antarctica {{were analyzed by}} instrumental neutron activation analysis. A {{large part of the}} total mass concentration of aerosol particles could be attributed to sea salt particles, both in winter and summer. The weight ratio Cl/Na for giant particles was larger than the <b>bulk</b> sea <b>water</b> ratio, whereas for large particles in summer it was smaller than that of <b>bulk</b> sea <b>water.</b> It can be explained that giant particles {{in the present study were}} blowing snow or drifting snow which was chlorine-enriched, and that large particles in summer were attacked by sulfuric acid droplets to release gaseous Cl to the atmosphere...|$|R
30|$|This {{involves}} {{the estimation of}} petrophysical parameters such as porosity, water saturation, hydrocarbon saturation, permeability, movable hydrocarbon index, <b>bulk</b> volume <b>water,</b> and residual oil saturation.

25|$|Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority. The Trans-Caledon Tunnel Authority (TCTA) is a {{state-owned}} entity {{with the}} mission to finance and implement bulk raw water infrastructure. It was created in 1986 to develop the Lesotho Highland Water Project, a joint project between Lesotho and South Africa. As of 2012, TCTA has developed or is developing six other dam and <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> supply projects throughout the country, including the Berg River Dam. TCTA sells <b>bulk</b> <b>water</b> to the government, represented by the Department of Water {{as the owner of}} the Water Boards that treat the water and sell it on to municipalities and mines. TCTA uses these revenues mainly to repay the debt it has raised to finance its infrastructure, its operating costs and to pay royalties to the government of Lesotho.|$|E
25|$|Water {{services}} {{are provided by}} the Cagayan de Oro Water District (COWD), the first water district established in the entire Philippines.
