40|$|The only widely-accepted {{method of}} gauging the {{ballistic}} {{performance of a}} material is to carry out ballistic testing; due to the large volume of material required for a statistically robust test, this process is very expensive. Therefore a new test, or suite of tests, that employ widely-available and economically viable characterisation methods to screen candidate armour materials is highly desirable; in order to design such a test, {{more information on the}} armour/projectile interaction is required. This work presents the design process and results of using an adapted specimen configuration {{to increase the amount of}} information obtained from a ballistic test. By using a block of ballistic gel attached to the ceramic, the fragmentation generated during the ballistic event was captured and analysed. In parallel, quasi-static tests were carried out using ring-on-ring biaxial disc testing to investigate relationships between quasi-static and <b>ballistic</b> <b>fragment</b> fracture surfaces. Three contemporary ceramic armour materials were used to design the test and to act as a baseline; Sintox FA alumina, Hexoloy SA silicon carbide and 3 M boron carbide. Attempts to analyse the post-test ballistic sample non-destructively using X-ray computed tomography (XCT) were unsuccessful due to the difference in the density of the materials and the compaction of fragments. However, the results of qualitative and quantitative fracture surface analysis using scanning electron microscopy showed similarities between the fracture surfaces of ballistic fragments at the edges of the tile and biaxial fragments; this suggests a relationship between quasi-static and ballistic fragments created away from the centre of impact, although additional research will be required to determine the reason for this. Ballistic event-induced porosity was observed and quantified on the fracture surfaces of silicon carbide samples, which decreased as distance from centre of impact increased; upon further analysis this porosity was linked to the loss of a boron-rich second phase. Investigating why these inclusions are lost and the extent of the effect of this on ballistic behaviour may have important implications for the use of multi-phase ceramic materials as armour...|$|E

In the case of the 2014 phreatic eruption of the Ontake Volcano in Japan, InSAR images detected surface displacements of about 10  cm toward a satellite in an area of about 1  km in diameter (Yamada et al. 2015). Detection of such narrow surface deformations during phreatic eruptions demonstrates the usefulness of InSAR analysis in volcano monitoring.

50|$|The hurricane's high {{storm surge}} swept into Miami and Miami Beach, {{flooding}} city streets with knee-deep water. Yachts and large vessels were {{carried by the}} intense wind and waves onto shore. The MacArthur Causeway connecting Miami and Miami Beach was submerged under 6 ft of water, and communication between the two locales {{as well as the}} rest of the United States was cut after all local telecommunications and power lines were blown down. Due to their susceptibility to strong winds, most wooden buildings in Miami were either blown down or lost their roofs. Concrete and steel buildings were warped at their bases. While skyscrapers mostly sustained minor damage, the 18-story Meyer-Kiser Building bore considerable damage.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{accelerate}} the development of ceramic materials for armour applications, by substantially increasing the information obtained from a high-energy projectile impact event. This has been achieved by modifying an existing test configuration to incorporate a block of ballistic gel, attached to the strike face of a ceramic armour system, to capture fragments generated during the ballistic event such that their final positions are maintained. Three different materials, representative of the major classes of ceramics for armour applications, alumina, silicon carbide and boron carbide, have been tested using this system. Ring-on-ring biaxial disc testing has also been carried out on the same materials. Qualitative analysis of the fracture surfaces using scanning electron microscopy and surface roughness quantification, via stereoimaging, has shown that the fracture surfaces of biaxial <b>fragments</b> and <b>ballistic</b> <b>fragments</b> recovered from the edges of the tile are indistinguishable. Although the alumina and boron carbide fragments generated from areas closer to the point of impact were also similar, the silicon carbide fragments showed an increase in porosity with respect to the fragments from further away and from biaxial testing. This porosity was found to result from the loss of a boron-rich second phase, which was widespread elsewhere in the material, although the relevance of this to ballistic performance needs further investigation. The technique developed in this work will help facilitate such studies...|$|R

40|$|The Averno 2 {{eruption}} (3, 700 ± 50 a B. P.) was {{an explosive}} low-magnitude event characterized by magmatic and phreatomagmatic explosions, generating mainly fall and surge beds, respectively. It {{occurred in the}} Western sector of the Campi Flegrei caldera (Campanian Region, South Italy) {{at the intersection of}} two active fault systems, oriented NE and NW. The morphologically complex crater area, largely filled by the Averno lake, resulted from vent activation and migration along the NE-trending fault system. The eruption generated a complex sequence of pyroclastic deposits, including pumice fall deposits in the lower portion, and prevailing surge beds in the intermediate-upper portion. The pyroclastic sequence has been studied through stratigraphical, morphostructural and petrological investigations, and sub- divided into three members named A through C. Member A was emplaced during {{the first phase of the}} eruption mainly by magmatic explosions which generated columns reaching a maximum height of 10 km. During this phase the eruption reached its climax with a mass discharge rate of 3. 2 106 kg/s. Intense fracturing and fault activation favored entry of a significant amount of water into the system, which produced explosions driven by variably efficient water-magma inter- action. These explosions generated wet to dry surge deposits that emplaced Member B and C, respectively. Isopachs and isopleths maps, as well as areal distribution of <b>ballistic</b> <b>fragments</b> and facies variation of surge deposits allow definition of four vents that opened along a NE oriented, 2 km long fissure. The total volume of magma extruded during the eruption has been estimated at about 0. 07 km 3 (DRE). The erupted products range in composition from initial, weakly peralkaline alkali-trachyte, to last-emplaced alkali-trachyte.

However, {{the ability of the}} ACH to protect soldiers against blast loading appears not to be as effective. Polyurea, a micro-segregated elastomeric copolymer has shown superior shock-mitigation capabilities. In the present work, a combined Eulerian/Lagrangian transient non-linear dynamics computational fluid/solid interaction anal-ysis is used to investigate potential shock-mitigation benefits which may result from different polyurea-based design augmentations of the ACH. Specific augmentations include replacement of the currently used suspension-pad material with polyurea and the introduction of a thin polyurea internal lining/external coating to the ACH shell. Effectiveness of different ACH designs was quantified by: (a) establishing the main forms of mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI); (b) identifying the key mechanical causes for these injuries; and (c) quantifying the extents of reductions in the magnitude of these mechanical causes.

40|$|The Newberry Pumice deposit forms {{a highly}} elliptical, eastward-extending lobe, and distal {{deposits}} are known from {{as much as}} 550 km downwind in Idaho. The 25 cm isopach has an aspect ratio of 7. 5 : 1. Pumice and lithic isopleths also have a strongly elliptical pattern for smaller clasts. Larger clasts (e. g. lithic fragments greater than about 10 cm in longest diameter) have a more nearly circular distribution. The maximum crosswind range for a 3. 2 cm lithic fragment is 7 km, and the maximum downwind range is 27 km. These data indicate a maximum column height of about 25 km and a tropopause wind velocity far in excess of 30 m/s. The three largest <b>ballistic</b> lithic <b>fragments</b> at a site on the south rim of Newberry caldera have 1. 0, 1. 12, and 1. 3 m median diameters.

40|$|Cellulose acetate nitrate (CAN) {{was used}} as an {{insensitive}} energetic binder to improve the insensitive munitions (IM) properties of gun propellants to replace the M 1 propellant used in 105  mm artillery charges. CAN contains the energetic nitro groups found in nitrocellulose (NC), but also acetyl functionalities, which lowered the polymer's sensitivity to heat and shock, and therefore improved its IM properties relative to NC. The formulation, development and small-scale characterization testing of several CAN-based propellants were done. The formulations, using insensitive energetic solid fillers and high-nitrogen modifiers in place of nitramine were completed. The small scale characterization testing, such as closed bomb testing, small scale sensitivity, thermal stability, and chemical compatibility were done. The mechanical response of the propellants under high-rate uni-axial compression at, hot, cold, and ambient temperatures were also completed. Critical diameter testing, hot fragment conductive ignition (HFCI) tests were done to evaluate the propellants' responses to thermal and shock stimuli.

40|$|Protection against weapon effects like <b>ballistic</b> impacts, <b>fragmenting</b> {{shells and}} explosions {{is the core}} {{business}} of the Explosions, Ballistics and Protection department of TNO (The Netherlands). Experimental and numerical research is performed to gain and maintain the knowledge to support the Dutch MoD and the industry to evaluate and develop adequate protection. The TNO high performance cluster (HPC) combined with the Laboratory for Ballistic Research (LBR) located in Ypenburg (NL) provide the essential infrastructure. Hitherto the numerical work was focussed on the response of steel -and RC-structures under blast loading and on ballistics for steel armour. Ballistic protection of ceramic armour concepts and RC panels was hardly studied numerically, while the dynamic response of concrete itself is a major research topic in the collaboration of TNO with the Delft University. It was decided to combine the gained knowledge and extend the numerical research to ballistic impact on “brittle targets”. This paper reports on the first steps of this research. It summarizes some of the difficulties and unknowns that were encountered and two aspects are highlighted. The commercial code (LS-DYNA) is used to simulate a ballistic impact and it is shown that the global variables of the experiments (penetration depth or residual velocity) can be matched quite well. However the damage predictions are questionable and highly dependent on the applied material model, and the available data to calibrate these models. This is illustrated with an example by varying the EOS, which is {{only one aspect of}} the material model. The other aspect that the paper addresses in more detail is the localisation problem and the mesh dependency for softening materials like concrete. To represent the dynamic loading conditions for the material, small elements are required to capture the stress gradients. The required element size is far smaller than the width of the fracture process zone.. In combination with the localization that occurs due to the description of concrete as a softening material, the traditional regularization techniques leads to incorrect descriptions of damage during a ballistic impact. A nonlocal method might overcome this limitation in order to attain more accurate damage predictions. A stress based non local approach is proposed and tested using benchmarks to show desired behaviour...|$|R

This paper presents {{the study of the}} design of a locally used ballistic helmet, i. e. Personnel Armor System for Ground Troop (PASGT) type helmet, from ergonomic perspectives and the identification of potential risk areas of injury based on the current ballistic helmet design. Two quantitative assessment techniques are employed in the investigation. First, a set of questionnaires were distributed to the current users of the PASGT helmet. The result showed that the 54. 8 % of respondents experienced pain on the parietal (top) area of their head, which is a potential risk area of head injury. Second, an experiment with 10 -mm thick sponge layer added to the interior part of the helmet was conducted to test its effect on the contact pressure between the head of the wearer and the medium size PASGT helmet while jogging on a treadmill at 8 km/h for 180 seconds. Mean of peak contact pressure with and without wearing the sponge of 2. 5 kPa and 2. 6 kPa, respectively, are obtained from the practical test. The maximum of peak contact pressure is found to be 3. 6 kPa with the sponge and 4. 2 kPa without the sponge. The results obtained in this study indicate that there are areas of discomfort interior to the PASGT helmet in contact with the wearer and that the discomfort can be minimized by appending a sponge layer to the frontal of the helmet...|$|R
40|$|This report summarises {{the field}} {{observations}} and interpretations of a reconnaissance trip to Guatemala in September 2010. The {{purpose of this}} trip {{was to investigate the}} impacts of the 27 May 2010 eruption of Pacaya volcano, located approximately 30 km SSW of Guatemala City. This eruption was of particular interest as it presented an opportunity to study an event with parallels to an eruption of the Auckland Volcanic Field and its consequences for the city of Auckland. A further interesting feature of this event was that a major tropical storm arrived immediately after the eruption, providing an opportunity to study the interaction between two co-occurring natural disasters. The 27 May 2010 eruption of Pacaya volcano began shortly after 14 h 00. The paroxysmal phase started shortly after 19 h 00 and lasted approximately 45 minutes. This phase generated a plume that was directed towards the north. At Cerro Chino, 1 km from crater, large <b>ballistic</b> <b>fragments</b> (up to half a metre in length) fell, killing one news reporter, injuring many others and destroying buildings, vehicles and equipment. This took local communities and civil defence by surprise as previous tephra falls had been to the west and southwest of the crater and preliminary civil defence efforts had been focussed on those areas. Three communities located 2. 5 - 3. 5 km to north of crater were particularly badly affected by the fall of ballistic clasts. Roofs in these towns were extensively damaged by ballistic blocks {{and to a lesser extent}} by tephra accumulation. The tephra plume travelled to the north, and Guatemala City was covered in an estimated 2 - 3 cm of coarse basaltic tephra which local residents described as being like ‘black sand’. The majority of the report is concerned with describing impacts of the tephra fall on Guatemala City. A prompt and efficient citywide cleanup was initiated by the city’s municipality to remove tephra from the 2100 km of roads in the capital. An estimated 11, 350, 000 m 3 of tephra was removed from the city’s roads and rooftops. The possibility of using the tephra for aggregate in cement production was investigated, but it was found to be too friable (low mechanical strength). It was disposed of in landfills around the city. Despite the cleanup operations, considerable quantities of tephra were washed into the city’s underground drainage network from where it was very difficult to remove. Blockages of stormwater drains led to surface flooding of the city’s road network which persisted for months afterwards. Tephra also entered the city’s many wastewater treatment plants, both by direct deposition and through sewer lines. There was no option but to clean out all these systems, an expensive and time-consuming job. A number of accidents happened during the cleanup operations. Limited data available from hospital emergency department admission records indicates that most of these were caused by people falling from their roofs, and other heights, while cleaning up the tephra. The eruption did not cause any discernible increase in respiratory illnesses above normal wintertime levels. This is probably due to several factors: the grain size of the tephra was coarse, with no material present in very fine fractions that can penetrate into the lungs, and the eruption happened in the evening and in rainy conditions and thus most people were indoors. The eruption appeared to have minimal effect on the functioning of two of Guatemala City’s large public hospitals, other than exacerbating pre-existing drainage and flooding problems for one of them as tephra blocked downpipes, gutters, drains and sumps. For electricity and water supplies, effects of the eruption on continuity of supply were minor, although problems were experienced. A geothermal plant close to the volcano was badly damaged by falling ballistic clasts, and had to be closed for repairs and cleaning for three weeks. Flashover was also a problem for distribution lines. Cleaning of tephra from substations was mostly unnecessary because of the arrival of the tropical rainstorm shortly afterwards. For the city’s water supplies, a large storage tank was contaminated by tephra and had to be cleaned out, and there was also abrasion damage to air-cooled motors and groundwater pumps, but generally there was little overall disruption to the continuity of supply beyond normal variations. Probably the most significant disruption caused by the tephra fall was the closure of the international airport for five days, to allow cleanup of the runway and apron. A complication of the cleanup operation was that the tephra was extremely abrasive, and in the process of cleaning a new bituminous runway surface was destroyed and all markings on the runway and apron were removed also. A similar, though more minor problem, was reported while cleanup of the large flat roofs of one of the public hospitals was underway, when a waterproof coating was damaged by abrasion. Development of cleaning methods to minimise abrasion damage may be worth considering for future eruptions of this type. The arrival of a major tropical storm immediately after the eruption generally added to the difficulties experienced by organisations and individuals involved in the response. The storm had a much larger and more widespread impact on the country, resulting in 160 deaths and over 168, 000 people requiring evacuation, compared to two deaths (plus two more indirect deaths due to accidents while clearing tephra) and just over 3, 000 people evacuated as a result of the eruption. While the heavy rains made some of the impacts of the eruption worse (in particular, it washed the tephra into underground drainage networks before the cleanup was complete, which has in turn worsened drainage problems in the city), it also dampened down the tephra, minimised the corrosive potential of the tephra by washing away its chemically active surface coating), and suppressed fires...|$|R
40|$|Abstract OBJECTIVES: We {{conducted}} a study to assess the need for routine ureteral stenting after ureteroscopic stone removal using Lithoclast pneumatic intracorporeal lithotripsy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 104 patients, prospectively divided in two groups to receive (group A, 52 patients) or not (group B, 52 patients) a stent after stone removal, underwent ureteroscopy {{for the treatment of}} ureteral lithiasis. The procedure was performed with the patient under either general or epidural anesthesia. A semirigid ureteroscope (Wolf 8. 9 Fr) was used in all cases and intracorporeal lithotripsy with ballistic energy was performed. In group A a double pigtail ureteral 4. 8 or 6 Fr polyurethane stent was placed following ureteroscopy. All patients were closely evaluated on follow-up examinations. The outcomes measured were postoperative patient pain, lower urinary tract symptoms, the need for hospital care {{as a result of the}} postoperative pain and late postoperative complications. RESULTS: The two patient groups were comparable with respect to the baseline variables of patient gender and age, stone location and mean stone size. Mean operative time plus or minus standard deviation (S. D.) in group A was 42 +/- 15 minutes (range 20 - 65) compared to 37 +/- 20 (range 15 - 60) in group B. Operative time was not significantly longer when a stent was placed (p = 0. 17). At day 3 the mean visual analog pain score in group B was much higher than in group A (p = 0. 01). Dysuria, hematuria and frequency/urgency were more prevalent in the stented group, although without statistically significant difference. Readmission to the hospital for unremitting pain was necessary in 12 of 104 patients (11. 5 %) all being in unstented group (p < 0. 05). The incidence of anatomical ureteral narrowing on IVP at 6 months follow-up was not statistically different between the two groups.
