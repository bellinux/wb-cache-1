40|$|<b>Bovine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> is {{disease of}} {{economic}} and public health significance in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease is distributed worldwide but some countries {{have been able to}} eradicate brucellosis from their territories using elaborate brucellosis control and eradication programmes that have been targeted primarily at livestock (the main reservoir host for the disease). This has been achieved mainly by vaccination, test and slaughter, as well as by regular surveillance for early detection of the disease.

The serological prevalence of <b>bovine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> at diptank level ranged from 0. 0 % to as high as 53. 3 % and 50. 9 %, as determined by the RBT and iELISA tests, respectively.

Conversely, the number of respondents who were unaware that <b>bovine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> is a zoonotic disease (25. 3 %) and a foodborne pathogen (21. 4 %), and the fact that over half (54. 5 %) of the respondents believed that <b>bovine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> was a treatable infectious disease was associated with the absence of veterinary assistance on the farm (60. 4 %). Because the eradication of <b>bovine</b> <b>brucellosis</b> has multiple factors, the success of the national eradication program cannot be based only on the sanitary management of infected herds.

40|$|An {{attempt was}} made to apply Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points (HACCP) system in dairy farms in Khartoum State and to suggest control limits based on the {{international}} standard. World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization recommended the HACCP system as a modern tool for disease prevention. Critical points were investigated in 150 farms using California Mastitis Test and Rose Bengal Plate Test for detection of <b>bovine</b> mastitis and <b>brucellosis,</b> respectively. The results revealed that the overall prevalence rates of <b>bovine</b> mastitis and <b>brucellosis</b> were 69. 3 % and 36 %, respectively. Other critical points were obtained from the owners of the dairy farms by a questionnaire, using non-probability sampling method or willingness of the owners for interview. Tick infestation was found in 94 % of the farms which could be a risk factor and the application of the odds ratio (OR) was 1. 694. The use of antibiotics for treatment of animals was, also, practiced in 54. 7 % of the farms. The critical points associated with environment in dairy farms and distribution of milk in Khartoum State was investigated, using a questionnaire survey and non probability sampling method. The condition of beddings was poor in 70 % of the dairy farms. Absence of cleaning and disinfection of the teats were recorded in 108 and 104 farms, respectively. Furthermore, distribution of the milk depended on either vehicle without chilling (50. 7 %) or donkey carts (49. 3 %). Quantification of the risk indicated that hand washing of the milkers could be a risk factor (OR = 2. 574), while the condition of the housing as well as the distribution of the milk could be a protective factor (OR= 0. 383 and 0. 278, respectively). In conclusion, many critical points associated with animals or environment were observed in dairy farms in Khartoum State. Diseases of animals included infectious and zoonotic disease, flies and tick infestation, use of antibiotics for treatment and absence of veterinary care. The critical points associated with environment were poor hygiene during handling, storage and distribution of the milk.

40|$|This {{study is}} {{a review of the}} {{development}} of economically significant diseases of cattle within the territory of the former German Democratic Republic from 1946 to 1989. The available literature was screened and evaluated according to certain time periods. These time periods were based on the development of GDR-agriculture, which is briefly summarized. The state of animal health in live stock cattle changed significantly {{during the course of the}} study period. In the beginning epidemics and venereal diseases were the most important cattle diseases, whereas towards the end, non-infectious diseases, particularly nutritional disorders, and multifactorial infectious diseases took this place. <b>Bovine</b> tuberculosis, <b>brucellosis,</b> trichomoniasis, vibriosis and warble fly infestation were eradicated in the GDR from 1946 to 1989. A significant relationship can be established between the development of agriculture and the main foci of diseases. Freestall housing, the foundation of large-scale live stock enterprises and industrialized cattle production caused specific animal health problems. Control of economically significant cattle diseases in the GDR was performed by an extensive public veterinary service under central government guidance and coordination. The efficiency of this system was high, especially in controlling epidemics, but it was restricted to the limited economic capacities of the GDR. The control of animal epidemics and parasitoses was mainly performed in an administrative manner. Area sanitation programmes were successfully applied for tuberculosis, brucellosis, warble fly infestation, mastitis agalactiae and leucosis. It was shown, that set-backs in controlling animal epidemics were often caused by uncertainties in diagnostic measures. To supervise the herd health situation relative to fertility and metabolic herd health, specific procedures were developed and applied in large live stock farms. The extensive scientific preparatory works on this matter as well as basic veterinary and epidemic hygienic demands, could and should be used in a prophylactically orientated veterinary care of cattle enterprises...|$|R
