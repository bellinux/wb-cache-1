Even though the Philippines is at a disadvantage, the GDP growth rate was 3.2 percent from a −0.5 percent low in 1998. In addition, domestic investment started to increase from 18.8% of GDP in 1999 to 21.1% of GDP in 2000. Faced with a high foreign debt even just after he assumed his office, President Estrada in his first State of the Nation Address (SONA) said that contractionary policies will be employed by cutting back on government expenditures {{with the help of}} a <b>budget</b> <b>framework.</b> At the end of 2000, total external debt had increased from year 1999 US$51.157 billion to US$51.358 billion. This rise was mainly due to the overspending of the National Government which resulted in a Php 136.1 deficit of cash operations. Also, the weakening of the Peso against the US Dollars (average of Php 44.19/US$1; record average low of Php 51.68/US$1 on October 31, 2000) resulted from the rise of US interest rates and greatly affected the borrowing of both the private and public sectors.|$|E
50|$|To {{support the}} growth envisioned in the government’s {{medium-term}} growth strategy, the Agenda for Transformation, Minister Konneh quickly introduced a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), a multi-year rolling <b>budget</b> <b>framework</b> {{that began in}} fiscal year 2012/2013 that saw an increase in public investments from a mere 7 {{percent of the budget}} to about 25 percent to finance critical infrastructure projects.Through an aggressive mobilization of domestic and external financing, he has led the government’s efforts that have raised more than $2 billion US Dollars to support the Agenda for Transformation. The most significant projects are the restoration of electricity to the country, construction of major highways to connect Liberia’s main economic corridors and rehabilitation of the country's sea and airports. Most of the funding secured so far constitutes grants with about 20% in concessional loans from various lenders including the World Bank, the African Development Bank, European Investment Bank, Kuwaiti and Saudi Funds and other bilateral financing.Through his leadership, he has ensured full compliance with the Public Financial Management Act under difficult circumstances, by implementing its core regulations. Through his administration, Liberia produced {{for the first time a}} mid-term budget performance report and a year-end report that is being audited by the General Auditing Commission, a crucial compliance requirements of the Public Financial Management Act which has become a tradition now by the Ministry of Finance and Development.Konneh has also worked to improve Liberia’s tax administration through a major reform he championed with the creation of the Liberia Revenue Authority (LRA) and has automated the chaotic voucher processing system at the Ministry of Finance that has improved the payment process and significantly reduced duplication. During his tenure, the Ministry of Finance has made great strides towards the decentralization of payroll though more challenges remain.He introduced for the first time in Liberia, the “Open Budget Initiative”-a platform through which citizens can access the budget and government spending, making Liberia the first country where ordinary citizens can now track spending to various sectors including health, education, infrastructure, etc. via mobile phones, on the Internet, through community radio stations and on an electronic billboard. This reform is also complemented by the publication of the Citizens Guide to the Budget, a yearly publication that is distributed nationwide to empower citizens to hold spending entities accountable for results.
