5000|$|It {{is often}} thought that Rina Ketty {{was born in}} Turin, Italy. However, in reality {{she was born in}} Sarzana, a small village in Liguria, on 1 March 1911 in the part of town known as Vetraia. Her <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> <b>number</b> 586 is kept by the parish of Saint André. She went to Paris in the 1930s to meet up with her aunts, where she became enthralled by the artist {{communities}} of Montmartre. She loved to visit the cabarets and started out to sing in 1934 in the Lapin Agile cabaret with songs by Paul Delmet, Gaston Couté, Théodore Botrel, and Yvette Guilbert. In 1936 she recorded her first songs (on the French Pathé Records label): [...] "La Madone aux fleurs", [...] "Près de Naples la jolie" [...] and [...] "Si tu reviens". These first songs did not really achieve wide acclaim. Things changed for the better in 1938, when Rina Ketty recorded the French version of an Italian success song [...] "Rien que mon coeur", which won the acclaimed Grand Prix du Disque, and with the song [...] "Prière à la Madone". Her name as a singer became well established with the song [...] "Sombreros et mantilles"; the text of which had been written by Chanty and the music by accordion player Jean Vaissade, whom she married that same year.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} provoke {{discussion}} about what society is aiming to achieve through systems of birth registration {{with respect to}} same-sex parenting particularly following assisted reproduction. It considers the position in the UK and contrasts this with various jurisdictions in Canada, which adopt differing approaches to birth registration in this context. Since {{the adoption of the}} Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008, it has been possible for two female parents to appear on a child’s <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> immediately following <b>birth</b> and for two male parents to be registered following the court granting a parental order in their favour. A number of issues remain unaddressed, however. For example, the terminology used in <b>birth</b> <b>certificates</b> needs to be explored further. Why are we reluctant to record a child as having two mothers or two fathers? There also needs to be greater discussion about the number of adults that can be recorded on a <b>birth</b> <b>certificate.</b> A <b>number</b> of jurisdictions in Canada allow more than two adults to be registered on a child’s <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> in order to reflect the parenting reality in some same-sex families. This raises questions about what the functions and legal effects of <b>birth</b> <b>certificates</b> should be. This is relevant in both a domestic and international setting, where a court declaration of parentage in addition to the <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> may be required before recognising the parent-child relationships in same-sex families when crossing national borders. Rather than reaching any firm conclusions on these points, the intention {{of this paper is to}} highlight these potentially controversial issues in the hope of stimulating debate around a topic that is of considerable importance in the lives of increasing numbers of same-sex families...|$|R

50|$|A <b>Birth</b> <b>Certificate</b> {{drawn from}} the Gender Recognition Register is now indistinguishable from any other <b>birth</b> <b>certificate,</b> and will {{indicate}} the new legal sex and name.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the validity of}} racial/ethnic information in California <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> data. DATA SOURCES: Computerized <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> data and postpartum interviews with California mothers. STUDY DESIGN AND DATA COLLECTION: <b>Birth</b> <b>certificates</b> were matched with face-to-face structured postpartum interviews with 7, 428 mothers to compare racial/ethnic information between the two data sources. Interviews were conducted in Spanish or English during delivery stays at 16 California hospitals, 1994 - 1995. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The sensitivity of racial/ethnic classification in <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> data was very high (94 percent to 99 percent) for African Americans, Asians/Pacific Islanders, Europeans/Middle Easterners, and Latinas (Hispanics). For Native Americans, however, the sensitivity was only 54 percent. The positive predictive value of <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> classification of race/ethnicity was high for all racial/ethnic groups (96 percent to 97 percent). CONCLUSIONS: Despite limited training of birth clerks, the maternal racial/ethnic information in California <b>birth</b> <b>certificate</b> data {{appears to be a}} valid measure of self-identified race and Hispanic ethnicity for groups other than Native Americans...|$|R
