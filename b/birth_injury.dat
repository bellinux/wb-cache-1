25|$|Enamel {{hypoplasia}} or hypomineralization is {{a defect}} of the teeth {{caused by a}} disturbance {{in the formation of}} the organic enamel matrix, clinically visible as enamel defects.

500|$|Tooth {{abnormalities}} {{caused by}} environmental factors during tooth development have long-lasting effects. Enamel and dentin do not regenerate after they mineralize initially. Enamel hypoplasia {{is a condition}} in which the amount of enamel formed is inadequate. This results either in pits and grooves in areas of the tooth or in widespread absence of enamel. Diffuse opacities of enamel does not affect the amount of enamel but changes its appearance. Affected enamel has a different translucency {{than the rest of the}} tooth. Demarcated opacities of enamel have sharp boundaries where the translucency decreases and manifest a white, cream, yellow, or brown color. All these may be caused by nutritional factors, an exanthematous disease (chicken pox, congenital syphilis), undiagnosed and untreated celiac disease, hypocalcemia, dental fluorosis, <b>birth</b> <b>injury,</b> preterm birth, infection or trauma from a deciduous tooth. [...] Dental fluorosis is a condition which results from ingesting excessive amounts of fluoride and leads to teeth which are spotted, yellow, brown, black or sometimes pitted. In most cases, the enamel defects caused by celiac disease, which may be the only manifestation of this disease in the absence of any other symptoms or signs, are not recognized and mistakenly attributed to other causes, such as fluorosis. Enamel hypoplasia resulting from syphilis is frequently referred to as Hutchinson's teeth, which is considered one part of Hutchinson's triad. Turner's hypoplasia is a portion of missing or diminished enamel on a permanent tooth usually from a prior infection of a nearby primary tooth. Hypoplasia may also result from antineoplastic therapy.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction & Objective: The {{first days}} of life has the highest risk in everyoneâ€™s life and the {{mortality}} rate in these days {{is equal to the}} mortality rate of the whole life. One of the causes of mortality in these days is <b>birth</b> <b>injuries.</b> Determining the type and incidence of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> and their risk factors can be useful in reducing the mortality rate in neonates. Materials & Methods: In this descriptive analytical study, 2005 neonates who were born in Imam Sajad Hospital in Yasouj/ Iran, between the years 2005 to 2006 were studied. The rate of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> and their risk factors were evaluated. Collected data were analysed by SPSS software using chi-squar test. Results: Out of 2005 neonates, 70. 4 % born by NVD and 29. 6 % by cesarian section. The study showed that 10. 8 % of NVD and 3. 7 % of cesarian section neonates had <b>birth</b> <b>injuries.</b> Two hundered and four of these injuries which occured in 175 of neonates were incude: capute succedaneom (36. 7 %), sub conjectival hemorrhage (27. 9 %), cephal hematoma (10. 2 %), facial erythema and abrasion (8. 8 %), facial echymosis (6. 3 %), hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (3. 4 %), brachial plexus palsy (3. 4 %), clavicular fractures (1. 4 %), facial nerve palsy (0. 4 %) and other skin lesions (0. 9 %). Risk factors were included NVD (difficult vaginal delivery), high gestation age, and low Apgar score at first minute of life, shoulder dystocia, vacuum and birth at night. Conclusion: The present study revealed that the incidence of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> in this area is high. Considering the serious complications of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> and hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy with no treatment for some cases, it seems that using the preventing methods to reduce the prevalence of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> is nessesar...|$|R

40|$|Background: Although the {{majority}} of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> are minor and often unreported, occasionally <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> may be so severe as to be fatal or leave the child with a permanent disability or even death. Objective: This study aimed to document the patterns and predictive factors of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> in neonates presenting at the emergency center of a tertiary hospital in South west, Nigeria. Patients And Methods: This was a cross-sectional study of neonates who presented at the Olikoye Ransome-Kuti Children Emergency Center of the Lagos University Teaching Hospital between October and December 2016. All neonates admitted for treatment {{at the center for}} any clinical condition were included in the study after initial review or resuscitation/treatment for their primary complaint, and consent was obtained from their caregivers. The babies were examined by at least a senior resident and any abnormality documented. Any underlining medical conditions such as asphyxia and neonatal sepsis were properly investigated and treated. Statistical analyses were performed by chi-square, student's t-test, using SPSS version 20. 0. P â‰¤ 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Results: A total of 134 neonates were reviewed during the study period with majority, 84 (62. 7 %), being males. The mean age at presentation was 65. 2 Â± 89. 2 h (median 24 h). Caput succedaneum (22. 2 %) and subconjunctival hemorrhage (22. 2 %) were the most frequent injuries observed, while cranial nerve injury the least. One patient had multiple injuries (cranial nerve injury with fractures humerus). Conclusions: Overall prevalence and pattern of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> in neonates presenting at our emergency center was consistent with various studies from other centers.

40|$|<b>Birth</b> <b>injuries</b> of the new-born infants {{might be}} caused either by {{mechanical}} or anoxic traumas that occur during the <b>birth.</b> The <b>injuries</b> {{might be a}} result of insufficient attention or inadequate efforts of the obstetrician but might as well occur completely independently of the obstetricianÂ´s activities. The character and extent of <b>birth</b> <b>injuries</b> are very wide and vary from the insignificant ones that are cured completely without any consequences to those that leave long-term consequences and that may even end in the death of the new-born infant. Cranial injuries of the new-born infants include: caput succedaneum (swollen scalp), cephalohaematoma, petechiae, suffusion, eye injuries, scalpel-incised wounds, parietal bones fractures, spinal cord injuries and intracranial haemorrhage. This Baccalaureate thesis surveys the knowledge of the nursing staff as far as <b>birth</b> cranial <b>injuries</b> are concerned and concentrates also at specific aspects of nursing new-born infants who suffer from caput succedaneum (swollen scalp) and cephalohaematoma. The theoretical part comprises the most important pieces of medical knowledge in nursing new-born infants with <b>birth</b> cranial <b>injuries.</b> The first goal of this thesis was to map the level of knowledge of the <b>birth</b> cranial <b>injuries</b> among the nursing staff. In compliance with this goal a hypothesis was stipulated: ?Members of the nursing staff are well-informed about <b>birth</b> cranial <b>injuries.</b> ? This hypothesis was verified and confirmed. It was found out that members of the nursing staff have good knowledge about <b>birth</b> cranial <b>injuries,</b> their predispositions and prevention. A quantitative research was carried out using the questioning method (the questionnaire technique was used). The research was carried out at the Neonatal Departments of the hospitals Nemocnice ÄŒeskÃ© BudÄ›jovice, a. s, Nemocnice PÃ­sek, a. s. and Nemocnice Strakonice, a. s. The second goal of this thesis was to map the specific aspects of nursing new-born infants who suffer from caput succedaneum (swollen scalp) and cephalohaematoma. In compliance with this goal a research question was stipulated: ?What are the specific aspects of nursing the new-born infants who suffer from caput succedaneum and cephalohaematoma?? It was found out that nursing new-born infants with caput succedaneum and cephalohaematoma does not comprise many specific aspects. The {{most important thing is to}} nurse such infants carefully and with caution, to position their heads on the side without caput succedaneum or cephalohaematoma, to check regularly the bilirubin level, to observe carefully the cephalohaematoma or caput succedaneum (its colour, size, localization) and to watch the behaviour of the new-born, mainly whether it shows any signs of pain. The research was carried out in a qualitative way using the question method ? the depth interview technique. The research file consisted of two nurses and two midwives from the Neonatal Department of the ÄŒeskÃ© BudÄ›jovice Hospital, a. s. The research has revealed that the nursing staff at neonatal departments is well informed about <b>birth</b> cranial <b>injuries</b> and that the nursing methods applied at new-born infants who suffer from caput succedaneum and cephalohaematoma do not differ much from the methods used in case of physiological infants.
