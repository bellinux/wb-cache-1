5000|$|From 1976 to 1985, the choking-rescue {{guidelines}} of the American Heart Association and of the American Red Cross taught rescuers to first perform a series of <b>backblows</b> to remove the FBAO (foreign body airway obstruction); if <b>backblows</b> failed, then rescuers learned {{to proceed with the}} Heimlich maneuver (aka [...] "abdominal thrusts"). After a July 1985 American Heart Association conference, <b>backblows</b> were removed from choking-rescue guidelines. From 1986 to 2005, the published {{guidelines of}} the American Heart Association and the American Red Cross recommended only the Heimlich maneuver as the treatment for choking; the National Institutes of Health still does apply it for conscious persons over one year of age, as does the National Safety Council.|$|R
40|$|Nanofibrous filter {{have been}} proven {{effective}} to remove nano-aerosols with size less than 100 nm. Cleaning is required after long-term use; however, very little has been published on the subject. An experimental investigation has been launched to determine backpulse, <b>backblow</b> and combined backpulse-backblow on cleaning of a loaded nanofiber filter. Nylon 6 nanofiber filters were loaded with polydispersed NaCl particles, 60 % < 100 nm and 90 % < 160 nm, generated from an aerosol generator. Air jets in form of backpulse, <b>backblow</b> and their combined mode were used to clean a loaded filter. During cleaning, the filter cake was removed first for which the pressure drop across the loaded filter decreased rapidly, followed by loosely attached aerosols in the filter being removed with finite pressure drop reduction at a reasonable rate, ending in the final stage for which much lesser aerosols were being removed. Ultimately, the filter reached a residual pressure drop which was {{higher than that of}} the initial clean filter indicating residual aerosols were trapped both in the cake heel and filter. Backpulse {{has been found to be}} more effective in removing the cake from the filter surface, whereas <b>backblow</b> provides an added advantage of removing by convection of the detached aerosols away from the filter preventing recapture. The synergistic combination of backpulse-backblow provides the best cleaning performance of a nanofibrous filter loaded with nano-aerosols. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 M ME 2017 Hau 98 pages :color illustrationsElectrospun nylon- 6 {{nanofiber}} filter, with fiber diameters of 100 to 300 nm, {{has been}} used for nano-aerosols filtration. Despite the effectiveness of filtration, the aerosol loading capacity of the filter is low and pressure drop across the filter increases rapidly with aerosol loading. This study examines the effectiveness of backpulse and <b>backblow</b> cleaning on nanofiber depth filter loaded with challenging polydispersed nano-aerosols with 50 - 60 % less than 100 nm and maximum size less than 300 - 500 nm. To investigate filter regeneration, a series of backpulses followed by <b>backblow</b> at constant air velocity was applied ona loaded nanofiber filter with maximum allowable pressure drop across the filter set at 600 - 1000 Pa. The function of backpulse is to provide inertia to break-up the particle-particle locking as well as particle-fiber adhesion while <b>backblow</b> is to carry the loosened particles away from the filter. Due to the fragility of nanofiber, a tri-nozzle setup has been introduced in the cleaning system to distribute the cleaning air relatively uniform across the filter instead of a concentrated jet targeted {{at the center of the}} filter that can damage nanofibers there. To optimize the cleaning conditions, the effect of several key parameters has been investigated-pulse jet, flow durations, numbers of jet pulses, and applied pressure. Also, the filter properties, such as nanofiber diameteraffecting particle-fiber adhesion as well as particle capture, and nanofiber filter thickness affecting particle capture and filter capacity have been studied. Unfortunately, both have negative effects on filter cleaning by backpulse and <b>backblow</b> due to large adhesion force of particles to fibers for nanofiber filter with smaller fiber diameter and due to increasing recapture of loosened particles for a thick nanofiber filter, respectively. For multilayer nanofiber filter, two inhomogeneous filters have been tested. One filter was made from a combo filter with a thickermicrofiber layer upstream and a thinner nanofiber layer downstream. The second filter was made from a nanofiber layer with mean fiber diameter of 280 nm located upstream and another nanofiber layer with mean fiber diameter of 180 nm located downstream. The cleaning effectiveness of the multilayer nanofiber filter was compared with a filter with only single nanofiber layer. The multi-layering configurationcan reduce the skin effect during aerosolloading, however, during cleaning with reversed flowthe downstream microfiber layer provided damping to the cleaning jet undermining the cleaning effectiveness on the upstream nanofiberlayer when compared to the case with regenerating only single nanofiber layer filter. For the filter with two nanofiberlayers, the downstream nanofiber layer enhanced the recapture of loosen particles during cleaning. Further, the presence of the downstream nanofiber layer also compromised the cleaning effectiveness of the nanofiber upstream layerduring reverse flow cleaning. Cyclic filtration, involving both loading and cleaning, have been carried out in both single-layer and multilayer nanofiber filters. Both filter configurations have shown stable behavior in which the growth in residual pressure drop and the decrease in filtration cycle time were present primarily in the first filtration cycle (i. e. the conditioning phase) and subsequently both variables remained relatively constant thereafter. The pressure versus time during loading wasconvex upward for the first loading cycle (at times linear), but changed over to concave downward in subsequent cycles. This isdue to the dead pores of the filter being prefilledwith aerosols after the first loading and cleaning cycle. Department of Mechanical EngineeringM.

40|$|A two-parameter {{model has}} been {{developed}} to interpret the pressure excursion during cleaning of a nanofiber filter preloaded with nano-aerosols. The model can well predict the three stages of cleaning - an initial rapid cake discharge phase, and a transition and a final phase, {{both of which are}} related to cleaning aerosols trapped in the filter. One of the two parameters of the model affects the residual pressure drop while the other parameter affects the cake discharge. The filter cleaning test data based on variations from the five operating and geometric parameters have been well explained by the new model - the backpulse, <b>backblow,</b> and combined mode; pulse duration; applied over-pressure; diameter of nanofiber in filter; and the filter thickness. Furthermore, the model can project the residual pressure, which provides an indication of residual aerosols trapped in the nanofiber filter, using individual or combination of these operating and geometric parameters.
