40|$|ABSTRACT Dried beans, {{because of}} theirhigh-fiber content and low-glycemic index,are {{especially}} suitable for diabetic diets. Most South African bean recipes contain sucrose, and since a restriction of artificial sweeteners seems desirable, replacing sucrose would be impractical. Hence, {{we examined the}} effects of 10, 20, and 30 % sucrose additions to cooked dried <b>butter</b> <b>beans</b> on taste preference and acceptability in 29 diabetic patients and 11 control subjects. The effect of sucrose additions on glycemic index and insulin response to <b>butter</b> <b>beans</b> was determined in control subjects. Both diabetic and control subjects preferred beans with sucrose additions (p < 0. 005). Additions of sucrose up to 20 % of total carbohydrate had no adverse effects on glycemic index or insulin response of <b>butter</b> <b>beans</b> (p < 0. 05), which indicates that addition of moderate amounts of sucrose to a low glycemic index food may improve palatability without impainng the favorable effect on blood glucose and insulin response...|$|R

The final preparation gave a single protein band on both disc polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In spite of its electrophoretic purity, the final enzyme preparation showed four glycosidase activities; / 3 -D-glucosidase, /S-D-galac-tosidase, / 9 -D-fucosidase, and /S-D-xylosidase. The molecular weight of the enzyme {{was determined to be}} 124, 000 ± 9, 000 by Sephadex G- 200 gel filtration, and 59, 000 ± 2, 400 by SDS-disc gel electrophoresis.

40|$|This {{survey was}} carried out to {{evaluate}} the dairy cattle production system, conventional feed resources and their nutritive values in Central Dry Zone (CDZ), Tatar U and Amarapura Townships, in Myanmar. The secondary data and questionnaires were accessed from 180 farmers of 180 households {{in the study area}} and made Focus Group Discussion (FGD) with them. According to the findings of this survey, most of farmers were relying on the agriculture for their livelihood and livestock farming played as the secondary role. As the gender issue, the role of female was vital for the development of dairy production sector indicating that female were the resource person in small-scale dairy production system. Generally, one household possessed 4 cattle including milking cows, heifers and calves. As breeding, natural breeding was still important for small-scale dairy farmers and the calving intervals were between 12 and 18 months. The average 11. 5 kg of milk per cow were recorded from the study area. Among the conventional feed resources, <b>butter</b> <b>bean</b> residue, natural grass and sesame residue were used as the roughages source...|$|E
40|$|Bean pod caliber is an {{important}} breeding criterion {{in the development of}} new French bean cultivars. Grading is manually performed with workers passing pods through a sieve with holes of different diameters. Each hole corresponds to a grade. Then, pods are weighed and a grade is given based on weight. This size grading is very tedious. Moreover, there is an inter- and intra-variability between workers, and the number of characteristics measured is limited. A new automatic method based on image analysis has been performed. It permits in a limited time, to extract and calculate different pod characteristics such as length, diameter and curvature. It offers the possibility to store images that could be helpful for traceability, and requires less labour than the current manual system. A correlation between the surface of pods and weight has been found, allowing the program to directly separate into grades based on weight. An acquisition chain has been installed and an image analysis program has been developed to calculate the different characteristics. The validation of the program has been performed on more than 150 batches of different cultivars of French and <b>butter</b> <b>bean</b> pods during 2008 and 2009. In this paper, the image analysis system is described. Results obtained with the new system are explained and compared to the manual system...|$|E

40|$|The Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), {{also known}} as pallar, ibes, garrofón or <b>butter</b> <b>bean</b> in Peru, México, Spain and USA, respectively, {{is the second most}} {{economically}} important species of Phaseolus. Peru is a centre of origin and domestication of Lima bean. This crop is cultivated mainly in the Central coast of Peru under a subtropical arid climate. In contrast to the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) which forms nodules with fast growing Rhizobium strains, the Lima bean forms nodules with slow growing bacteria of the Bradyrhizobium genus (López-López et al. 2013, Ormeño-Orrillo et al. 2006). We found strains of Bradyrhizobium yuanmingense and of three novel Bradyrhizobium genospecies inside P. lunatus nodules in Peru (Ormeño- Orrillo et al. 2006). Strains of the three novel genospecies were characterized by showing an extra-slow growing phenotype (generation time > 10 h- 1) and strong alkali production in yeast extract mannitol medium. Two of the novel genospecies were recently named as Bradyrhizobium paxllaeri and Bradyrhizobium icense (Durán et al. 2014). B. paxllaeri strains dominate nodule occupancy followed by those of B. icense and then the third and yet-unnamed genospecies. With the aim to gain insights into this differential competitive ability, we sequenced the genome of one representative strain of each species. Sequencing was performed with the Illumina HiSeq or MiSeq platform and genome assembly with the SPAdes program. Gene prediction and automated annotation was performed with Prokka and RAST. Annotation of genes putatively involved in competitiveness was manually curated. Assemblies had from 55 to 175 contigs, with N 50 sizes > 131 kb. Genome sizes of B. paxllaeri and B. icense were similar (8. 2 Mb) and larger than that of the third genospecies (7. 8 Mb). Preliminary analysis revealed differences between B. paxllaeri and the other two genospecies such as more genes for type IV pilus and two nodA genes. A comparative genomic analysis of P. lunatus symbionts will be presented at the meeting...|$|E
