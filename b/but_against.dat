5|$|Harry Redknapp {{had come}} in as manager for Birmingham's last three matches of 2016–17, and agreed to stay on for the new season. Donaldson started the first four league matcheshe did not score, <b>but</b> <b>against</b> Burton Albion he {{combined}} with strike partner Lukas Jutkiewicz to create a goal for Maghomaand took his Birmingham record to 33 goals from 117 appearances in all competitions. Redknapp completely revamped the team during {{the last couple of}} weeks of the transfer window, bringing in two strikers and other attacking players, and late on deadline day, Donaldson moved on.|$|E
5|$|Amphibious {{landings}} at Inchon by X Corps hit North Korean {{forces from}} behind, allowing I Corps and IX Corps {{to break out}} of Pusan. Four days later I Corps troops pushed northward against crumbling enemy opposition to establish contact with forces of the 7th Infantry Division driving southward from the beachhead. Major elements of the North Korean Army were destroyed and cut off in this aggressive penetration; the link-up was effected south of Suwon on 26 September. The offensive was continued northwards, past Seoul, and across the 38th Parallel on 1 October. The momentum of the attack was maintained, and the race to the North Korean capitol, Pyongyang, ended on 19 October when elements of the South Korean 1st Infantry Division and U.S. 1st Cavalry Division both entered the city. The advance continued, <b>but</b> <b>against</b> unexpectedly stiffening enemy resistance. On 25 October the first Chinese prisoners on the Eighth Army front were taken by I Corps troops. By the end of October the city of Chongju, forty miles from the Yalu River border of North Korea, had been captured.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the UN forces arrived at Hungnam, MacArthur had already ordered the {{evacuation}} of the US X Corps on 8 December in order to reinforce the US Eighth Army, which by then was badly depleted and retreating rapidly towards the 38th parallel. Following his orders, the ROK I Corps, the ROK 1st Marine Regiment, the US 3rd Infantry Division and the US 7th Infantry Division had also set up defensive positions around the port. Some skirmishes broke out between the defending US 7th, 17th and 65th Infantry and the pursuing PVA 27th Corps, <b>but</b> <b>against</b> the strong naval gun fire support provided by US Navy Task Force 90, the badly mauled 9th Army was in no shape to approach the Hungnam perimeter.|$|E
50|$|Star Force also borrows {{the same}} {{elemental}} properties that Battle Network uses. The four elements include: Heat (fire-based), Aqua (water and ice-based), Elec (electricity-based), and Wood (plant and wind-based). Elements {{are attached to}} certain attacks and to enemies' (or Mega Man's) defenses. When an element is hit with an element that it is weak to, double-damage is dealt. Heat is weak <b>against</b> Aqua <b>but</b> strong <b>against</b> Wood, Aqua is weak <b>against</b> Elec <b>but</b> strong <b>against</b> Heat, Elec is weak <b>against</b> Wood <b>but</b> strong <b>against</b> Aqua, and Wood is weak <b>against</b> Heat <b>but</b> strong <b>against</b> Elec.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} special types of cards. Along with the battle types are {{elements}}. The elements of these cards includes fire, water, wood, earth, and neutral. Each type {{has its own}} advantage over another: Fire is strong <b>against</b> wood, <b>but</b> weak <b>against</b> water. Water is strong <b>against</b> fire, <b>but</b> weak <b>against</b> earth. Wood is strong <b>against</b> earth, <b>but</b> weak <b>against</b> fire. Earth is strong <b>against</b> water, <b>but</b> weak <b>against</b> wood. Neutral is a special and rare element, as it has no strengths and weaknesses against the other elements. Aside from finding new cards, Katia can also buy, sell, transform, and capture new cards.|$|R
50|$|Star Force {{continues}} the same elemental properties that previous Star Force titles have used. The four elements include: Heat, Aqua, Elec, and Wood. Elements {{are attached to}} certain attacks and to enemies' defenses. When an element is hit with an element that it is weak to, double-damage is dealt. Heat is weak <b>against</b> Aqua <b>but</b> strong <b>against</b> Wood, Aqua is weak <b>against</b> Elec <b>but</b> strong <b>against</b> Heat, Elec is weak <b>against</b> Wood <b>but</b> strong <b>against</b> Aqua, and Wood is weak <b>against</b> Heat <b>but</b> strong <b>against</b> Elec. However, in a Person VS. Person match, attacking the other player with an element that they are weak to does not deal double damage. Instead, it makes their Noise go down to 0%, and reverts them back to normal.|$|R
5|$|Myles' Mary Collins {{prosthetic}} {{took six}} hours to accomplish, and the shot where she morphs into the younger Lady Helen took seven hours to complete because it required three stages of make-up. Her first {{performance at the}} beheading scene was met with applause by the extras; Head requested that he redo {{his part of the}} scene because he felt that it was not good enough. Gaius' fall from the balcony was done by a stuntman and filmed with a high-speed camera. The mattress that Merlin magically moves across the floor was achieved with rigging it up to hidden wires and pulleys under the set. The knives Arthur throws were actually shot out of a nitrogen gun; James did throw them in a separate shot, <b>but</b> <b>against</b> a cloth that he still missed. Fake fruit was made for the stocks scene, but it was deemed too fake-looking and was replaced with real tomatoes. The mace fight was originally filmed with plastic maces, but they were not believable as they did not have enough weight. The scene was then shot with real steel maces; {{it was one of the}} most complex and hardest scenes to execute. The climax, where the guests all fall asleep and are covered by cobwebs, took many days to complete. The chandelier falling was also considered difficult.|$|E
5|$|The {{commander}} of the British I Corps in 1914 was Douglas Haig. French had remarked in 1912 that Haig would be better suited to {{a position on the}} staff than a field command. Like French, Haig was a cavalryman. His last active command had been during the Second Boer War, first as a senior staff officer in the cavalry division, then commanding a brigade-sized group of columns. The first {{commander of}} the British II Corps was Lieutenant General James Grierson, a noted tactician who {{died of a heart attack}} soon after arriving in France. French wished to appoint Lieutenant General Herbert Plumer in his place, <b>but</b> <b>against</b> French's wishes, Kitchener instead appointed Lieutenant General Horace Smith-Dorrien, who had begun his military career in the Zulu War in 1879 and was one of only five officers to survive the battle of Isandlwana. He had built a formidable reputation as an infantry commander during the Sudan Campaign and the Second Boer War. After the Second Boer War, he was responsible for a number of reforms, notably forcing an increase in dismounted training for the cavalry. This was met with hostility by French (as a cavalryman). By 1914, French's dislike for Smith-Dorrien was well known within the army.|$|E
5|$|The {{divisions}} in the Labour Party became more acute during 1931, as the government struggled to meet the May Report's recommended expenditure cuts of £97 million, the majority (£67 million) to be found from reductions in unemployment costs. On 23 August 1931 the government collapsed. To implement the required cuts, MacDonald and {{a small number of}} Labour MPs formed a National Government with the Conservatives and Liberals, while the bulk of the Labour Party, including Wilkinson, went into opposition. In the general election that followed in October the Labour Party was utterly routed, retaining only 52 of its parliamentary seats. In Middlesbrough East Wilkinson's vote was nearly the same as her 1929 total, <b>but</b> <b>against</b> a single candidate representing the National Government she was defeated by over 6,000 votes.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech {{entered the}} 2005 season having won the 2004ACC Championship, {{the last to}} be awarded without playing a {{championship}} game {{at the end of}} the season. Tech won its first eight games and appeared to be on course to have an untroubled run to the ACC Championship Game. <b>But</b> <b>against</b> the fifth-ranked Miami Hurricanes, Tech suffered its first defeat of the season, losing 277 on November 5. Because each team had one ACC loss (Miami had previously lost to Florida State) and the Hurricanes had the tie-breaking head-to-head win, Miami had the lead in the Coastal Division. But Miami later lost a second ACC game to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, and the Hurricanes were knocked out of contention for the Coastal Division title in favor of the Hokies, who lost only to Miami.|$|E
5|$|While {{some of the}} {{conditions}} to allow a currency war were in place at various points throughout this period, countries generally had contrasting priorities and at no point were there enough states simultaneously wanting to devalue for a currency war to break out. On several occasions countries were desperately attempting not to cause a devaluation but to prevent one. So states were striving not against other countries <b>but</b> <b>against</b> market forces that were exerting undesirable downwards pressure on their currencies. Examples include The United Kingdom during Black Wednesday and various tiger economies during the Asian crises of 1997. During the mid-1980s the United States did desire to devalue significantly, but were able to secure the cooperation of other major economies with the Plaza Accord. As free market influences approached their zenith during the 1990s, advanced economies and increasingly transition and even emerging economies moved {{to the view that}} it was best to leave the running of their economies to the markets and not to intervene even to correct a substantial current account deficit.|$|E
5|$|With {{the failure}} of the Battle of Moscow, all German plans for a quick defeat of the Soviet Union had to be revised. The Soviet counteroffensives in December 1941 caused heavy {{casualties}} on both sides, but ultimately eliminated the German threat to Moscow. Attempting to explain matters, Hitler issued Directive N. 39, which cited the early onset of winter and the severe cold for the German failure, whereas the main reason was the German military unpreparedness for such a giant enterprise. On 22 June 1941, the Wehrmacht as a whole had 209 divisions at its disposal, 163 of which were offensively capable. On 31 March 1942, less than one year after the invasion of the Soviet Union, the Wehrmacht was reduced to fielding 58 offensively capable divisions. The Red Army's tenacity and ability to effectively counter-attack took the Germans as much by surprise as their own initial attack had the Soviets. Spurred on by the successful defense and in an effort to imitate the Germans, Stalin wanted to begin his own blitzkrieg campaign, not just against the German forces around Moscow, <b>but</b> <b>against</b> their armies in the north and south. Anger over the failed German offensives caused Hitler to relieve Field Marshal Walther von Brauchitsch of command and in his place, Hitler assumed personal control of the German Army on 19 December 1941.|$|E

5|$|Sainsbury {{reached a}} half-century {{on his first}} {{appearance}} for Somerset in first-class cricket in 1883, scoring 51 runs against the MCC. He did not reach 50 in his next three appearances for the county, <b>but</b> <b>against</b> Gloucestershire he top-scored for his side in their first innings with 59, and then when Somerset were forced to follow on, he scored his only century in first-class cricket, amassing 116 runs before {{he became one of}} W. G. Grace's eleven victims in the match. Sainsbury played in seven matches during 1883, and achieved his highest batting average in a season, his century and two fifties boosting him to 27.92. Although he played another 31 first-class matches during his career, he did not score more than 40 runs in an innings after 1883. He also recorded his best bowling average in 1883, claiming his nine first-class wickets at 18.55. In early June 1884, Sainsbury played for a side representing the South of England, scoring 3 and 29 during a 66-run victory for the South. Playing for Lansdown against the touring Gentlemen of Philadelphia the following month, he scored the only century of the match, reaching 108, and sharing a first wicket partnership of 149 with E. M. Grace. He batted poorly for Somerset during 1884, failing to reach double figures in most of his innings, and hitting a top score of 30 for the county. His season average was dramatically lower than the previous season, dropping below 10.|$|E
