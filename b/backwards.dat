5|$|On February 21, 2013, Six Flags Great America {{announced}} that their Batman: The Ride roller coaster would run <b>backwards</b> {{for a limited}} time during the 2013 season. Six Flags Magic Mountain and Six Flags Over Texas did the same during the 2014 season. Six Flags Over Georgia and Six Flags Great Adventure followed suit running theirs <b>backwards</b> for a limited time in 2015.|$|E
5|$|Written by Peter Ling, this {{involved}} {{a story in}} which time runs <b>backwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|An ancient {{solution}} to a flow problem is a curve whose evolution can be extrapolated <b>backwards</b> for all time, without singularities. All of the self-similar solutions that shrink or stay the same size rather than growing are ancient solutions in this sense; they can be extrapolated <b>backwards</b> by reversing the self-similarity transformation that they would undergo by the forwards curve-shortening flow. Thus, for instance, the circle, grim reaper, and Abresch–Langer curves are all ancient solutions.|$|E
5|$|As Mars {{approaches}} opposition {{it begins}} {{a period of}} retrograde motion, which makes it appear to move <b>backwards</b> in a looping motion relative to the background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion is about 72 days.|$|E
5|$|Considering {{the notion}} that positrons were {{electrons}} that were traveling <b>backwards</b> in time, he came up in 1940 with his one-electron universe postulate: that there was in fact only one electron, bouncing {{back and forth in}} time. His graduate student, Richard Feynman, found this hard to believe, but the idea that positrons were electrons traveling <b>backwards</b> in time intrigued him and Feynman incorporated the notion of the reversibility of time into his Feynman diagrams.|$|E
5|$|Dialogue {{heard in}} the dream {{sequence}} uses a distinctive reversed manner of speech. This was achieved by recording the actors' line phonetically reversed, and playing this audio <b>backwards.</b> David Lynch had begun experimenting with the technique in 1971, and had originally planned {{to use it in}} his 1977 debut feature, Eraserhead, before it finally found use in this episode. Describing the process of learning his lines <b>backwards,</b> Anderson notes that he first worked out the phonemes of each word rather than simply reading it back to front, and disregarded the inflection of any given word as this helped bolster the discordant effect of the end result. The reversed audio was also altered with a slight reverb effect. The actors were required to perform their movements <b>backwards,</b> as elements of the scene would be reversed entirely.|$|E
5|$|Early {{models of}} the Wii are fully <b>backwards</b> {{compatible}} with GameCube software {{and most of its}} accessories; the Wii Family Edition and the Wii Mini iterations lack GameCube support. Early versions of the PlayStation 3 and all {{models of the}} Xbox 360 only offer partial support and use software emulation for <b>backwards</b> compatibility. Current versions of the PS3 do not offer PlayStation 2 compatibility, though PS1 compatibility is retained. Some models of the first generation of the PS3 offered full <b>backwards</b> compatibility for PS2 games. The Xbox 360's compatibility is increased through game-specific patches automatically downloaded from Xbox Live or downloaded and burned to a CD or DVD from the Xbox website and the PS3's compatibility is expanded with firmware updates.|$|E
5|$|He is {{voiced by}} Asai Kiyomi. In the Mew Mew Power English {{adaptation}} {{his name is}} changed to Tarb (Which is brat <b>backwards)</b> and he is voiced by Jimmy Zoppi.|$|E
5|$|Hummingbirds {{are small}} birds capable of {{hovering}} in mid-air {{due to the}} rapid flapping of their wings. They are the only birds that can fly <b>backwards.</b>|$|E

5|$|In September 2017 (exactly {{a decade}} after the release of the game), Halo 3 became {{available}} on the Xbox One via <b>backwards</b> compatibility.|$|E
5|$|In the anime {{adaptation}}, {{his voice}} actor is Daisuke Sakaguchi. In the Mew Mew Power English adaptation {{his name is}} changed to Dren (which is nerd spelled <b>backwards)</b> and he is voiced by Andrew Rannells.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2004, an {{out-of-service}} Red Line train rolled <b>backwards</b> {{into the}} Woodley Park station, hitting an in-service train {{stopped at the}} platform. The rear car (1077) was telescoped by the first car of the standing train (4018). No one was killed, but 20 people were injured. A 14-month investigation concluded that the train operator was most likely not alert as the train rolled <b>backwards</b> into the station. Safety officials estimated that had the train been full, at least 79 people would have died. The train operator was dismissed and Metro officials agreed to add rollback protection to more than 300 rail cars.|$|E
5|$|On October 23rd, 2017, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time {{was one of}} the {{thirteen}} <b>backwards</b> compatible titles for Xbox One.|$|E
5|$|Tarbosaurus lacked these bony struts, and the {{connection}} between the nasals and lacrimals was weak. Instead, a <b>backwards</b> projection of the maxilla was massively developed in Tarbosaurus and fit inside a sheath formed from the lacrimal. This projection was a thin, bony plate in North American tyrannosaurids. The large <b>backwards</b> projection suggests that force was transmitted more directly from the maxilla to the lacrimal in Tarbosaurus. The lacrimal was also more firmly anchored to the frontal and prefrontal bones in Tarbosaurus. The well-developed connections between the maxilla, lacrimal, frontal and prefrontal would have made its entire upper jaw more rigid.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox 360 {{version of}} Call of Duty 2 became <b>backwards</b> {{compatible}} on Xbox One on August 23, 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Xbox 360 {{version was}} added to the <b>backwards</b> {{compatibility}} feature for the Xbox One in June 2016.|$|E
5|$|The opposite, group {{velocities}} exceeding c, {{has also}} been shown in experiment. It should even be possible for the group velocity to become infinite or negative, with pulses travelling instantaneously or <b>backwards</b> in time.|$|E
5|$|A Game of the Year Edition {{containing}} all downloadable {{content was}} released for both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, on 11 October 2011 in North America and on 14 October 2011 internationally. Additionally, Microsoft added {{the game to}} its <b>backwards</b> compatibility list for Xbox One platforms in July 2016.|$|E
5|$|A pawn moves {{straight}} forward one square, if that square is vacant. If {{it has not}} yet moved, a pawn also has the option of moving two squares {{straight forward}}, provided both squares are vacant. Pawns cannot move <b>backwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|All three {{consoles}} provide titles {{from older}} consoles for download; the Xbox 360 through the Xbox Originals service, the PlayStation 3 through the PlayStation Store, and the Wii through the Virtual Console. When purchased, {{the game is}} saved to console's internal memory or, optionally on the Wii, to an inserted SD/SDHC card. Initially the Xbox 360 also provided Xbox Live support for <b>backwards</b> compatible games, but the service has since been discontinued for original Xbox games. No more games {{will be added to}} the list of <b>backwards</b> compatible games for the Xbox 360. In response to the lack of backward compatibility for most PS3s, many popular games have been released for download as PlayStation 2 Classics and other popular series have been updated with gameplay/graphics as high-definition remasters for PlayStation consoles and have been released on Blu-ray Disc or are available for download on the PlayStation Network.|$|E
5|$|An omnibus {{edition of}} the first two novels was {{released}} in 1992, including edits to the original text and extra material such as the original pilot script of the TV series. All four novels have been released in audiobook format, the first two read by Chris Barrie, Last Human read by Craig Charles, and <b>Backwards</b> read by author Rob Grant.|$|E
5|$|As Mars {{approaches}} opposition, {{it begins}} {{a period of}} retrograde motion, which means it will appear to move <b>backwards</b> in a looping motion {{with respect to the}} background stars. The duration of this retrograde motion lasts for about 72 days, and Mars reaches its peak luminosity {{in the middle of this}} motion.|$|E
5|$|Asser recounts meeting Alfred {{first at}} the royal estate at Dean, Sussex (now East and West Dean, West Sussex). Asser {{provides}} only one datable event in his history: on St Martin's Day, 11 November 887, Alfred decided {{to learn to read}} Latin. Working <b>backwards</b> from this, it appears most likely that Asser was recruited by Alfred in early 885.|$|E
5|$|Even when staying {{relatively}} motionless, a rider can {{balance a}} bike {{by the same}} principle. While performing a track stand, the rider can keep {{the line between the}} two contact patches under the combined center of mass by steering the front wheel to {{one side or the other}} and then moving forward and backward slightly to move the front contact patch from side to side as necessary. Forward motion can be generated simply by pedaling. <b>Backwards</b> motion can be generated the same way on a fixed-gear bicycle. Otherwise, the rider can take advantage of an opportune slope of the pavement or lurch the upper body <b>backwards</b> while the brakes are momentarily engaged.|$|E
5|$|Extrapolation of the {{expansion}} of the universe <b>backwards</b> in time using general relativity yields an infinite density and temperature at a finite time in the past. This singularity indicates that general relativity is not an adequate description of the laws of physics in this regime. Models based on general relativity alone can not extrapolate toward the singularity beyond the end of the Planck epoch.|$|E
5|$|In {{ascending}} cholangitis, it {{is assumed}} that organisms migrate <b>backwards</b> up the bile duct as a result of partial obstruction and decreased function of the sphincter of Oddi. Other theories about the origin of the bacteria, such as through the portal vein or transmigration from the colon, are considered less likely.|$|E
5|$|John Turturro as Jesus Quintana. The Coen {{brothers}} let Turturro {{come up with}} a lot of his {{own ideas}} for the character, like shining the bowling ball and the scene where he dances <b>backwards,</b> which he says was inspired by Muhammad Ali.|$|E
5|$|Kenny Baker as R2-D2, an astromech droid {{that saves}} Queen Amidala's ship when other droids fail. Before the film's {{production}} started, fans campaigned on the Internet to retain Baker as R2-D2; Lucas replied that the actor would remain. Baker {{is used for}} scenes where R2-D2 bends forwards and <b>backwards</b> and wobbles from side to side. Robots and a digital model were used in other shots.|$|E
5|$|Navi (Ivan spelled <b>backwards),</b> a {{nickname}} for the star Gamma Cassiopeiae: Grissom used this name, plus two others for White and Chaffee, on his Apollo 1 mission planning star charts as a joke, and the succeeding Apollo astronauts kept using the names as a memorial.|$|E
5|$|Net-casting spiders weave {{only small}} webs, but then {{manipulate}} them to trap prey. Those {{of the genus}} Hyptiotes and the family Theridiosomatidae stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them, but do not actively move their webs. Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs, hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs, and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their own body length to trap prey, and this move may increase the webs' area {{by a factor of}} up to ten. Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey: <b>backwards</b> strikes to catch flying insects, whose vibrations it detects; and forward strikes to catch ground-walking prey that it sees. These two techniques have also been observed in other deinopids. Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids, but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the <b>backwards</b> strike.|$|E
5|$|Parthian sculptures depict wealthy women wearing long-sleeved robes over a dress, with necklaces, earrings, bracelets, and headdresses bedecked in jewelry. Their many-folded dresses were {{fastened}} by a brooch at one shoulder. Their headdresses {{also featured}} a veil which was draped <b>backwards.</b>|$|E
5|$|Peringskiöld {{commented that}} the stone was {{reclining}} <b>backwards</b> in a hop-garden at the eastern farm of Lövsta, which was later confirmed by Celius in 1726. Stolpe tried to find it, but noted in 1869 that the landowner knew of the runestone, but that the latter had reported it to be completely covered in soil, and in 1951, a runologist tried to locate the runestone but failed.|$|E
5|$|Rope dart: The rope dart is {{a weapon}} used in Chinese martial arts. It {{consists}} of a long rope with a metal dart attached at the end. The dart can be thrown as a long range weapon while the rope is used to pull the dart <b>backwards.</b> The first written description of the rope dart is dated from the Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 AD).|$|E
5|$|Sony {{announced}} {{before the}} PS3 launch in Europe that the PlayStation 2's Emotion Engine CPU would {{be removed from}} it for cost savings, and all <b>backwards</b> compatibility would be software-based. This is also {{the same for the}} 80 GB model launched in the North American market in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Stela 2 {{was found}} in centre of the West Plaza. The butt of this stela {{was found in}} its {{original}} location, although the shaft has broken and fallen <b>backwards.</b> Stela 2 {{does not appear to}} have had any sculpted designs or text. It was associated with Altar 1.|$|E
