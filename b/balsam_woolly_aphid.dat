2500|$|Aphids {{are in the}} {{superfamily}} Aphidoidea in the Sternorrhyncha {{division of}} the order Hemiptera. Late 20th-century reclassification within the Hemiptera reduced the old taxon [...] "Homoptera" [...] to two suborders: Sternorrhyncha (e.g., aphids, whiteflies, scales, psyllids, etc.) and Auchenorrhyncha (e.g., cicadas, leafhoppers, treehoppers, planthoppers, etc.) with the suborder Heteroptera containing {{a large group of}} insects known as the true bugs. Early 21st-century reclassifications substantially rearranged the families within Aphidoidea: some old families were reduced to subfamily rank (e.g., Eriosomatidae), and many old subfamilies were elevated to family rank. The most recent authoritative classifications place all extant taxa into a single large family Aphididae. Despite their names, taxonomically, the woolly conifer aphids like the pine aphid, the spruce aphid, and the <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> are not true aphids, but adelgids, and lack the cornicles of true aphids.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1960 The <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> (Adelges piceae (Ratz)), an European pest of conifers, {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the Pacific Northwest shortly after 1930. Control measures of a chemical, silvicultural, or biological nature have been proposed. However, present control methods are either too costly or do not result in satisfactory control of the aphid. Several insect species were reported as predaceous upon the <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> in Europe, eastern Canada, and the Pacific Northwest. European predators of this pest have been imported into eastern Canada {{in an effort to}} find a satisfactory control measure. Several species of insects from Europe were imported into the Pacific Northwest from 1957 through 1959. Laricobius erichsonii was successful in becoming at least temporarily established in this region and was chosen for further study. The purpose of the thesis project was to obtain information on the establishment, life history, habits, and effectiveness of this beetle in Oregon and Washington. Studies were begun in May of 1958 and terminated in November of 1959. Two species of the genus Laricobius are indigenous to the Pacific Northwest. Franz has studied the life history and ecology of L. erichsonii in Europe, and Clark and Brown have made observations of establishment, spread, life history, habits, and effectiveness in eastern Canada. In 1958 and 1959, 10, 125 L. erichsonii, adults were collected in Czechoslovakia and sent to the Pacific Northwest Forest and Range Experiment Station in Portland, Oregon, for release in the Pacific Northwest. Predators were released either freely or in cages at eight different areas in Oregon and Washington. Temporary establishment occurred at all of the release areas regardless of varied weather and elevational differences. Some 52 larvae were collected and mounted on slides in 1959. Of these larvae, no first, one second, four third, and 47 fourth instars were present. First and second instar larvae tend to stay within the aphid's wax masses, while third and fourth instar larvae wander about the bark in search of food. Moulting was observed. At the various release areas, larvae were recovered from May 23 through August 26 of 1959 and adults from May 5 through September 2. Two pupae were laboratory-reared from five, field-collected fourth instar larvae. Under laboratory conditions, one fourth instar larva consumed or destroyed seven eggs and two adults in a period of one and one-half hours. L. erichsonii adults prefer aphid adults but attack other stages. Range of observed dispersal, a year following release, ranged from zero to 75 feet from the point of original release. A study was initiated at Benton-Lane, Oregon, to study the effectiveness of L. erichsonii in reducing <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> populations. Trend of host populations was evaluated at approximately two week intervals on six unprotected and two protected (control) one-inch-square bark plots on a pole-sized grand fir surrounded by a six-foot-cube study cage. On the protected plots, the average aphid population increased from 31 to 131 individuals in the period from May 1 through November 23 of 1959, while on the unprotected plots it increased from 47 to 64 individuals. A t-test was calculated to see if the differences between protected and unprotected plot populations were significant. The t-value obtained was 4. 3, which showed that the differences were significant at the one per cent significance level. It is felt that populations of the <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> will be greatly reduced when L. erichsonii can combine with other predators that are fairly host specific and that prey on all stages of the aphid...|$|E

40|$|The <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid,</b> Adelges piceae (Ratz.), is an {{introduced}} pest of European origin. It {{was discovered}} in Maine and New Hampshire in 1908, in Nova Scotia in 1929, and in Newfoundland in 1949 (Balch, 1952). True firs, Abies spp., are the only hosts of the aphid which causes severe damage to balsam fir, A. balsamea (L.) Mill., the predominant fir species in the Atlantic Provinces. Severe damage is caused by high numbers of aphids feeding in the crowns and on the stems of trees. In Newfoundland, rapid deterioration of tree crowns predominates; stem attack occurs infrequently and in widely dispersed spots (Carroll and Bryant, 1960).

40|$|The {{biology of}} Pullus impexus (Muls.), a Coccinellid beetle predacious on Adelges piceae (Ratz.) in Switzerland, Germany and France, was studied during 1950 - 1952. The present {{work is a}} part of the {{research}} on the complex problem of factors in the control of the <b>Balsam</b> <b>Woolly</b> <b>Aphid</b> in Canada. The morphology of both the larva and the adult has been studied. Some information has been provided on the probable distribution of the species. P. impexus has only one generation a year. The eggs are deposited during the late summer or early autumn on infested trees and the larvae hatch in April. The larvae develop and adults appear in May. The adults of the new generation are to be found in June together with adults of the old generation. In the biology, particular attention has been directed to the diet of the insect in each of its stages, in order to establish the value of the species from the standpoint of biological control. Two new species of Hymenopterous parasites were found in Switzerland and in Germany, Scymnophagus mesnili Ferr., a parasite of pupae, and Centistes scymni Ferr., a parasite of the imagines. The life history of these species has been briefly studied. A cephaline gregarine species was noted in the mesenteron of adults of P. impexus and a nematode in the abdominal cavity of a female. The two Hymenopterous species provide an important limiting factor in the increase of the population of P. impexu...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1971 Cambial {{activity}} was studied in trees infested by the <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> and in non-infested trees of grand and subalpine fir. Infested and non-infested samples of grand fir were collected near Corvallis during 1968 and 1969. Samples of subalpine fir, noninfested and infested, were collected near Odell Lake, at approximately 5, 000 ft. elevation, during 1969. Light infestations of the aphid {{were observed in}} both species. No differences within species between infested and non-infested trees were noted {{in the number of}} overwintering immature (precocious) sieve cells or in the dates for reactivation and cessation of mitotic activity in the cambial zone, or in the number of cambial zone cells per radial file. The relative amounts of xylem and phloem present at any given time during the growing season were the same regardless of {{the presence or absence of}} aphids. Significant differences were noted in the lengths of the fusiform initials in the infested samples when compared to non-infested samples in both species. Xylem production in grand fir, and phloem production in both species was significantly greater in infested samples. A greater number of phloem parenchyma strands were observed in infested samples of grand fir than in non-infested samples. The rate of cell division, as indicated by the mitotic indices, showed no significant differences between samples of infested and non-infested trees of either species. Differences in xylem and phloem production between infested and non-infested trees could not be attributed to either an increased rate of cell division or an increase in the number of cambial zone cells per radial file in infested samples for either species...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1964 Three {{species of}} true firs in the Pacific Northwest [...] Abies gran-dis, grand fir; A. amabilis, Pacific silver fir; and A. lasiocarpa, subalpine fir [...] are {{severely}} damaged or {{killed by an}} imported insect pest, the <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> (Chermes (Adelges) piceae Ratz.), Infestations of this insect cause abnormalities in the wood and, in some cases, result in death of the tree. Wood samples were collected from five infested and five noninfested trees {{of each of the}} three species. Cross, radial, and tangential sections were taken from the wood samples, and samples were also macerated to separate the cells. Measurements were made of four anatomical characteristics: cell wall thickness, cell width, fibril angle, and tracheid length. Measurements were made of wood that was produced before infestation of the tree, wood of the same tree that was produced after infestation, and wood of noninfested trees. Wood produced after infestation in all three species is like compression wood in that the percentage of summerwood is greatly increased, tracheids are round in cross section, intercellular spaces are present, microscopic checking occurs in the cell waIIs, and false rings are present. The number of rays is almost double the number found in noninfested trees, and the diameter of the ray cells appears to be greater. Springwood cell walls of infested trees are sinuous in nature. Traumatic resin canals in tangential bands may be differentiated {{at any time during the}} growing season. Cell walls of the springwood of infested trees were significantly thicker than the springwood ceII walls of wood produced before infestation and also of noninfested trees for all three species, but there were no differences with regard to the summerwood. There were no significant differences in cell width for wood from each species. This was true for both springwood and summerwood. Fibril angle in the summerwood and transition area in infested trees of each species was two to three times greater than the angle found in wood produced before infestation and in noninfested trees. No differences in the fibril angle in springwood occurred. Tracheid length in infested wood was considerably reduced following infestation. Tracheids of wood produced before infestation, and in noninfested trees, were approximately one and one-half to two times longer than tracheids of infested trees...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1969 The <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> <b>aphid</b> (Adelges piceae Ratz.) feeds by {{inserting}} its stylets intra- and intercellularly into the cortex or outer phloem {{of the true}} firs. While feeding, the aphid injects into the bark an unknown stimulatory substance which affects the adjacent cortical parenchyma cells, {{the activity of the}} vascular cambium and the differentiation of the xylem. This study examines non-infested, infested, and aphid-aban doned trees of grand fir (Abies grandis [Dougl. ] Lindl.) collected through the year by serial cross, radial, and tangential sections of the cortex, secondary phloem, cambium, and a portion of the xylem. The cortex of grand fir is composed mainly of parenchyma cells filled with resins, tannins, and sometimes crystals. Some of the parenchyma cells differentiate into astrosclereids. After infestation the cortex is characterized by hypertrophy of the nuclei and cortical parenchyma cells. As these cells enlarge into giant cells, there is an increase in density of the cytoplasm. Later a cork cambium is initiated around the pockets of giant cells. Reactivation and cessation of the cambium in infested, non-infested, and aphid-abandoned trees do not differ any more than the natural tree-to-tree variations that are due to location and exposure. The dormant cambium of infested trees maintains a wider radial file of cells in the cambial zone than do the cambiums of non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. The cambium of infested trees generally produces more cells per year by increases in both periclinal and pseudotransverse divisions spread more or less evenly throughout the year. Pseudotransverse divisions in the non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees are generally limited to {{the latter half of the}} growing season. The sieve cells of the non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees are longer than those of the infested trees, but those of the infested trees are larger in radial width. The tangential widths do not vary. Rays are produced by anticlinal divisions of fusiform initials and by decline of fusiform initials. More declining tiers are noted in infested trees than in non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. The fusiform initials decline to form one or more ray initials. In the latter case, the segmented initial produces two or more separate ray initials by unequal periclinal divisions and by maturation of some initials in the strand. The phloem rays usually accumulate a greater abundance of resins than do those of non-infested trees. The cambium of infested trees produces more tangential bands of phloem parenchyma cells and fiber sclereids than that of non-infested and aphid-abandoned trees. Traumatic resin ducts are initiated in the differentiating xylem, especially in heavily-infested trees. In the material examined, these were initiated in the spring, but they can occur at any time during the growing season. After prolonged presence of feeding aphids, phloem ray cells develop abnormalities such as dumbbell-shaped nuclei or a binucleate condition. Astrosclereids and resin cells were noted in all categories of trees studied. The astrosclereids were seen in all samples collected, whereas the resin cells appeared only in certain trees of the various categories...|$|E
40|$|The <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> adelgid (Adelges piceae Ratzeburg) attacks subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt.) {{in eastern}} Washington, Oregon, and {{northern}} Idaho. Historical <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> adelgid distributions present {{an opportunity to}} understand climatic factors that influence the species’ distribution at a landscape scale. The distribution data allows for creation of predictive models that detail the likelihood of occurrence and associated geographic data allow modeling of species dispersal.

5000|$|Since the {{invasion}} of the <b>balsam</b> <b>woolly</b> adelgid, discovered in 1957, Fraser fir mortality rates have been 90-99%.
