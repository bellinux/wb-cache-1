These problems result in limited breeder participation in spawning. The present study provided an ethogram and described mate selection and spawning of captive wild Senegalese sole. Two tanks of breeders were studied that had 29 and 25 <b>breeders</b> (<b>mean</b> weight = 1. 6 ± 0. 1 kg). The behaviour was studied during 20 periods of 24 hours: 10 periods where spawning events were recorded and 10 control periods without spawning events. Periods where spawning occurred had three times more locomotor activity than periods without spawning. Two distinct behaviours, termed the “following” behaviour and the “coupled swim”, were only observed during periods with spawning. The courtship sequence (n= 12) began with males predominantly involved in “following” behaviours, whilst females remained mainly stationary {{on the bottom of}} the tank. Males rested on the females and encouraged the females to begin swimming. When the female began to swim the male swam under the female and the pair made a “coupled swim” to the surface to release gametes. Gamete release was strictly in pairs of one male with one female. Failed “coupled swims” without gamete release were 5. 6 times more frequent than successful “coupled swims”. Mate selection was evident as the sole engaged in: paired spawning, males displayed to females, males encouraged females to spawn and females accepted or rejected the male’s advances. The mate selection process provided the opportunity for fish to dominate the spawning and also demonstrated how fish were excluded from spawning...|$|R

During the last 30  years, mushroom productivity has increased substantially {{as a result of}} improved composting techniques and optimized environmental conditions, {{and to a lesser extent}} by breeding efforts. The first hybrid cultivar Horst U 1 (Fritsche 1981), was released in the 1980 s.

Mushroom breeding has been so far an applied science and new varieties have been generated mainly modifying existing varieties by selecting fertile single spore cultures or by generating multi spore cultures. Generating new varieties with sufficient qualities by outbreeding appears to be a difficult task (personal communications with spawn companies and personal experiences).

In 30 -week-old breeder eggs, body weights and erythrocytic parameters were not influenced by temperature but liver and heart weights decreased increasing incubation temperature and glucose level increased at 36 and 39 °C. In 60 -week-old breeder eggs, males were heavier at hatching with incubation at 36 °C and females had smaller body weights with incubation at 39 °C.

Although their fasting capacities have been well investigated in captivity, we still {{know very little about}} the energetics of freely breeding birds. 3. We monitored heart rate (HR, a proxy to energy expenditure), body temperature and physical activity of male king penguins during their courtship and first incubation shift in a colony of some 24 000 freely breeding pairs. Males were breeding either under low but increasing colony density (early breeders) or at high and stable density (late breeders). 4. In early <b>breeders,</b> daily <b>mean</b> and resting HR decreased during courtship but increased again 3 days before egg laying and during incubation.

This finding remained significant even after controlling for climate effects. 5. In both early and late breeders, courtship and incubation were associated with a progressive decrease in physical activity, whereas core body temperature remained unchanged. 6. We discuss the roles of decreased physical activity and thermoregulatory strategies in sustaining the long courtship-incubation fast of male king penguins.

To assess any potential genetic resistance of broilers and/or age-related effects, we investigated the pathogenesis and transmission of A/turkey/Minnesota/ 12582 / 2015 (H 5 N 2) (Tk/MN/ 15) virus in commercial 5 -week-old broilers, 8 -week-old broilers, and > 30 -week-old broiler <b>breeders.</b> The <b>mean</b> bird lethal dose (BLD 50) was 5. 0 log 10 mean egg infectious dose (EID 50) for all age groups.

All broilers that became infected shed high levels of virus with transmission to contacts and demonstrated severe pathology. Mortality and virus shedding results indicated that age is not a determinant factor in susceptibility of broilers to H 5 N 2 clade 2. 3. 4. 4 HPAI virus.

Additional objectives were to calculate the correlation between eggshell conductance, porosity, and thickness and correlate these parameters with incubation data. The study design was fully randomized in a 3 × 3 factorial scheme (three egg regions - large end, equator, and narrow end - and three ages of broiler breeders – 29, 35, and 59 weeks). A total of 216 eggs were used, with 24 repetitions for each treatment. Neither conductance nor shell thickness showed any interaction with egg region. Breeder age influenced eggshell conductance, such that it was greatest in eggshells from 59 -week breeders (0. 323 mg day− 1 torr− 1), while for 29 -week and 35 -week breeders, the conductance values found were 0. 285 and 0. 270 mg day− 1 torr− 1, respectively.

Recent advances of cloned genes and molecular markers in barley provide molecular <b>breeders</b> with the <b>means</b> to develop new, simple PCR-based molecular markers, {{which can be used}} to select frost-tolerant genotypes quickly without stress simulation. This paper reports the development of two STS markers derived from the RFLP probes WG 644 and PSR 637, chosen as they are located on the long arm of homoeologous group 5 chromosomes of Triticeae, known to harbour the most important loci for frost tolerance. The two STS markers were validated together with one selected RAPD marker, OPA 17, by separating two sets of winter and spring barley genotypes with different levels of frost tolerance. The ability of the developed markers to select segregant frost-tolerant and frost-susceptible genotypes was then investigated in a population of doubled haploid lines derived from a cross between a highly tolerant ('Nure') and a susceptible ('Tremois') genotype. In this population only two markers, OPA 17 and Psr 637 demonstrated their efficiency in dividing the phenotypes according to the parental alleles. These two markers mapped on the long arm of chromosome 5 H, tightly linked to two frost tolerance QTLs. Two polymorphic bands of the WG 644 STS were mapped: the former on the long arm of chromosome 5 H (Wg 644 c) and the latter (Wg 644 b) on the long arm of chromosome 2 H...|$|R

One of the major challenges in genome-enabled prediction is how to construct a training set of genotypes from a calibration set that represents the target population of genotypes, where the calibration set is composed of a training and validation set. A random sampling protocol of genotypes from the calibration set will lead to low quality coverage of the total genetic space by the training set when the calibration set contains population structure. As a consequence, predictive ability will be affected negatively, because some parts of the genotypic diversity in the target population will be under-represented in the training set, whereas other parts will be over-represented. Therefore, we propose a training set construction method that uniformly samples the genetic space spanned by the target population of genotypes, thereby increasing predictive ability. To evaluate our method, we constructed training sets alongside with the identification of corresponding genomic prediction models for four genotype panels that differed in the amount of population structure they contained (maize Flint, maize Dent, wheat, and rice).

Chick losses ranged from 3 to 17 percent of the eggs laid and occurred more or less evenly from hatching to fledging. Most egg losses were occasioned by desertions by adults, and most deaths of chicks occurred when one or both parents died. Approximately 3. 5 percent of 4, 492 banded, departing fledglings died of starvation and exhaustion on the beaches. Losses to sharks in the nearby waters were thought to increase fledgling mortality to perhaps 10 percent before the surviving young birds reached the open sea. A mean 6. 8 percent of 7, 000 juveniles were lost {{in each of the}} first 4 years at sea, but in each of the next 4 years, when the birds were more experienced and had spent more time in the colonies where there were no natural predators, annual mortality averaged only 1. 8 percent. Young <b>breeders</b> had a <b>mean</b> annual mortality of 3. 7 to 4. 0 percent in their first nine breeding seasons, whereas a total of 3, 305 breeders of all ages had a mean annual mortality of 5. 3 to 6. 3 percent. There was no consistent sexual variation in mortality of breeding birds, but in 2 years of low breeding populations females experienced greater losses. Prior to the 14 th year of life, the stresses of reproduction were perhaps more significant mortality factors than was age. Age may have been a factor after this, but not until the years after 20 was there any indication of increased mortality. Approximately 40 percent of the breeding albatrosses lived to a minimum of 12 years, 30 percent to 14 years, 25 percent to 16 years, 20 percent to 18 years, and 13 percent to 20 or more years. Laysan Albatrosses may have a breeding life expectancy of some 16 to 18 years...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{selection}} for higher milk production has unavoidably {{resulted in a}} decline in fertility of dairy cattle in the UK due to the antagonistic correlation existing between fertility and milk yield. This trend in fertility has necessitated broadening the breeding programme to include fertility traits. However, the heritability of fertility traits currently used in the UK are of low heritability (h 2 < 0. 05). Therefore, one approach is to use molecular markers {{in order to identify}} animals with the highest genetic merit for fertility. The first aim of this project was therefore to test single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes for their possible associations with fertility PTAs. A group of 408 dairy cows and bulls were genotyped at different loci (GnRH receptor, FSH receptor, LH receptor, activin receptor, and neuropeptide Y receptor Y 2 (NPYRY 2)). Seven SNPs were identified in the GnRH receptor gene. These were in the promoter and coding regions at positions - 331, - 108, 206, 260, 341, 383 and 410 relative to the translation start site. Two groups of SNPs were found to be in linkage disequilibrium, the SNPs at positions 206 and 383 being inherited together, as were those at - 108, 260, 341 and 410. An association study between these SNPs and fertility PTAs revealed that the - 108 SNP group was associated with favourable effects on fertility, reducing PTA for DFS by about 0. 4 day. However, when GnRHR gene function was evaluated by measuring circulating LH level after administration of GnRH in pre-pubertal animals, no significant associations of the SNPs with LH levels were detected. Furthermore, five SNPs were identified in the FSHR at residues 502, 669, 596, 658, and 685, four of which (at positions 502, 669, 658, and 685), had deleterious effects on fertility PTAs, increasing CI and DFS, while decreasing NR 56. Inaccurate heat detection has been identified as a major contributor to low fertility in dairy cattle, and therefore the second aim of this project was to investigate oestrus expression traits for which BLUP breeding values were estimated. Electronic tags (Fullwood and Lily) were used to measure behavioural activities at oestrus in two separate groups of animals. The first group comprised 103 cows in their first parity. Oestrus behaviour traits were: the number of steps at oestrus (STEPS) and the percentage {{increase in the number of}} steps at oestrus (STEPS%) relative to the number of steps over the 10 days preceding oestrus (BASE). Cows in this group were genotyped at 10 genes (GnRHR, LHR, FSHR, oestrogen receptors α and β (ESR), activin receptor, leptin, ghrelin, neuropeptide Y (NPY) and NPYRY 2 for SNP identification. Of these SNPs, only those located in the GnRHR, oestrogen receptor α and NPY were found to have statistically significant effects on oestrus traits. The second group consisted of 189 cows with 995 oestrus behaviour records. Oestrus traits were: the number of activity units (AU) at oestrus (ACTIVITY) and the percentage increase in the number of AU at oestrus (ACTIVITY%) over baseline activity (BASE) determined over a 4 day rolling average. In addition to the above mentioned 10 genes, these cows were genotyped at signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 and 5 A (STAT 1, STAT 5 A), growth hormone receptor (GHR), prolactin, and prolactin receptor genes. In this study SNPs in the GnRHR, LHR, FSHR, ESRα, GHR, activin receptor, STAT 1, and STAT 5 were found to have significant effects on oestrus expression. The genetic basis for oestrus behaviour was also investigated applying various animal models in this group. ACTIVITY, ACTIVITY% and BASE had moderate heritabilities of 0. 19 to 0. 24, 0. 16, and 0. 25 respectively. The breeding values of the cows were shown to be normally distributed, and ranged between - 19 to 27, - 18 to 20, and - 20 to 28 for ACTIVITY, ACTIVITY%, and BASE respectively. These values are significant in terms of the ability of the stockman to reliably detect cows in heat. There have in the past been few genetic analyses of oestrus behaviour characteristics, and there are few studies of SNP associations with fertility traits of the kind described here. Therefore these studies make a significant contribution to our understanding of the genetics of fertility in dairy cattle, and can be used by <b>breeders</b> as a <b>means</b> to improving fertility in the national dairy herd...|$|R
