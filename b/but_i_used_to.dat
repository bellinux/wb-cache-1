5|$|My main character, {{the deputy}} head, is a manic git, and he's {{based on a}} guy I never {{actually}} met and is therefore being denigrated terribly. He had already retired by the time I started <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> get a lift to work from his wife, who still worked there. And she would tell me stories about him with the affectionate disdain of {{anyone who has been}} married for more than a year. In the staff room, all these bitter teachers who hadn't been promoted would describe him as someone who would only briefly consider stopping short of invading Poland if he got the chance. I've since found out that the real man is actually a very nice bloke.|$|E
2500|$|Hedberg {{was known}} to be a drug user, {{mentioning}} it in some of his jokes (e.g., [...] "I used to do drugs. I still do, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> too"). In May 2003 he was arrested in Austin, Texas, for heroin possession.|$|E
2500|$|Poulidor {{has several}} times {{accepted}} that {{his career was}} handicapped {{by a lack of}} ambition and by the psychological domination of Jacques Anquetil. Poulidor {{said in an interview in}} 1992: I knew straight away that I was getting places everywhere. I got all the leaders' jerseys <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> lose them. Tonin [...] said to me [...] "Raymond, you're always in a daydream!" [...] And was that true? Were you distracted? It was true. I thought what was happening to me was already marvellous enough. I never thought of winning. Never, ever, did I get up in the morning with the idea of winning! ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{dark night}} gave me black eyes, <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>use</b> them <b>to</b> seek the light.黑夜给了我黑色的眼睛 我却用它寻找光明 ...|$|R
5000|$|Mister: Good {{afternoon}} Mr. Inodoro. How are you?Inodoro: <b>I</b> am bad, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "True, Tommy, that's {{only right}} an' fair. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> ain't <b>used</b> <b>to</b> lookin' up when discoorsin'. Couldn't {{you come down}} here an' lay alongside?" ...|$|R
2500|$|Burton said, [...] "I've never studied acting or {{anything}} because I've been so lucky with MTV. I'm convinced I {{got the chance}} to be on One Tree Hill because I did a guest thing on Dawson's Creek as myself, when the cast appeared at the MTV Beach House." [...] She added, [...] "And my only scene was with Chad Michael Murray (Lucas Scott). So, now The Chad and I are reunited. How bizarre is that?" [...] With regard to what her life is like as an actress, Burton said, [...] "Actors like to think their lives are very difficult, but they're not. Yeah, you're running around a lot. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> work in a supermarket and in a bar. That was hard. This is fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't know; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{dream that}} I had broken down, {{and had no}} money, and was {{starving}} in London. I thought about it all day, and it frightened me--oh, how it frightened me!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{my young}} days all I thought of was gadding about," [...] said Mrs. Carr, smiling. [...] "I wasn’t very strong either; {{it was just}} my spirits kept me up. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> suffer for it afterward." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't {{mean that}} of course. You'd never laugh at children, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> thought--I <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think--that perhaps you might laugh about them. So now I beg your pardon.... What {{are you going}} to laugh at?" ...|$|R
6000|$|This was {{a pretty}} plain demonstration; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it, as what young man of fortune is not?--and a danger known is a danger avoided. I pressed the hand I held gently, relinquished it, and then observed, in a {{somewhat}} disappointed tone---- ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You waited anxiously,' {{repeated}} Mrs V. 'Yes! Thank you, Varden. You waited, as {{you always}} do, that I might bear the blame, if any came of it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> am <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it,' said the lady {{with a kind}} of solemn titter, 'and that's my comfort!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{for many}} years. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think I {{was a regular}} rip-snorter when I was a youngster up in Eastern Oregon, sneaking away from camp to ride with the cattle and break cayuses {{and that sort of}} thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is 'er," [...] ses Bill, {{stroking}} his long white beard and casting 'is eyes {{up at the}} ceiling. [...] "You don't remember me, Mrs. Pearce, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> see you years ago, when you and poor Charlie Pearce was living down Poplar way." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{think you}} were trying to do it. Well, Link wrote about it, and he wanted to know if I would help him in a scheme to pay you back. He said he had a dandy scheme to pay you off." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{beg your}} pardon, sir, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am <b>used</b> <b>to</b> find Mr Riah at this time, and so I {{generally}} come at this time. I {{only want to}} buy my poor little two shillings' worth of waste. Perhaps you'll kindly let me have it, and I'll trot off to my work.' ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> drink {{black coffee}} {{means that in}} the past I drank black coffee, <b>but</b> now <b>I</b> don't. <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> {{describes}} an action that did happen, but does not happen now.|$|R
6000|$|... "I tell 'ee wot it is, young man--seems to me you're pumpin' of me {{for some}} ends of yer own as I'm not acquainted with; now, I tell 'ee wot it is, <b>I</b> ain't <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be pumped. No offence meant, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> ain't <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be pumped, an' if you've got {{anything}} to say, speak it out fair and above board like a man." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "True, Ebony, so you did; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{think your}} {{energetic}} praise {{was due to}} your enthusiastic disposition, and so {{paid no attention to}} your invitations to go for'ard an' listen. Well, I confess I was a loser. You must have played the instrument a long time, surely?"--turning to the seaman.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know her. I {{never made}} {{acquaintance}} with her. I was too seedy. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> watch her and--I don't know why--to {{be interested in}} her. She's a dear little Yankee woman. I have an idea she is a schoolmistress taking a holiday, for which her scholars have made up a purse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Headache?" [...] said Uncle Chris, {{starting}} like a war-horse {{that has}} heard the bugle. [...] "I don't know if I have ever mentioned it, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> suffer from headaches at one time. Extraordinarily severe headaches. I tried everything, until one day a man I knew recommended a thing called--don't {{know if you have}} ever heard of it...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{suppose it}} can't be helped: <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am <b>used</b> <b>to</b> being {{out in all}} weathers. I can wait, {{just as well as}} not. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> don't want my {{daughter}} here to get wet, and she has no umbrella. Would you mind taking her on your boat? When you get to the town, she can run up to our hotel by herself. She knows the way." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God. I hesitate to call it a vow, it was rather a promise <b>to</b> myself <b>but</b> later <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think that it was my obligation …" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, he is {{not good}} enough, I am afraid,' said Anne, 'though besides our own Vandyke there is a most tempting print of him, in Lodge, with a buff coat and worked ruffles; <b>but</b> though <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think him the {{greatest}} of heroes, I have given him up, and mean to content myself with Charles himself, the two Lindsays, Ormond and Strafford, Derby and Capel, and Sir Ralph Hopton.' ...|$|R
60|$|GRACE. Well, {{since you}} ask me, I never {{was in love}} with Tranfield, though I only found that out when I fell in love with you. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> like him for being in love with me. It brought out all the good in him so much that I have wanted to be in love with some one ever since. I hope, now that I am in love with you, you will like me for it just as I liked Tranfield.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{met some}} Boston people in Italy, and I thought I {{should like to}} live where that kind of people lived. That's the way I came to be in Boston. It all seems very simple now, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think it might look romantic from the outside. I've had a happy life; and I'm glad it began in the country. I shouldn't care if it ended there. I don't know why I've bothered you with my autobiography, though. Perhaps because I thought you knew it already." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{that went}} on for weeks. He used to follow me to church, as the boys do in country towns, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> go to {{different}} places {{just to see if}} he would find out and be there to meet me at the door. He never offered to speak to me or take my arm, but he stood to see me go by. Do you know, if I go into a country church today, that scent of wilted flowers and linen and mingled perfumes almost makes me weep?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no," [...] she wrote, [...] "I do {{not mind}} at all. Of course I am sorry <b>I</b> cannot speak, <b>but</b> <b>I</b> am quite <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the thought {{and it never}} hurts me at all." ...|$|R
5000|$|After {{winning the}} {{regional}} beauty competition of Novokuznetsk, {{she went to}} Moscow and started a modelling career. In Moscow {{she worked as a}} manager, she was organizing competitions and helping models to find work abroad. There she worked as second degree designer too. About her life in Moscow, Litvinova said [...] "Moscow is a very large, noisy, bustling city. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> got <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it and loved it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he confessed, [...] "I {{was a bit}} shivery at first; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> got <b>used</b> <b>to</b> it. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> {{feel sorry}} for that poor girl, though. That made me forget to be afraid. She was such a beauty, in spirit {{as well as in}} appearance, and she was only {{slightly}} touched; yet she was doomed to lie there, living the life of a primitive savage and rotting slowly away. Leprosy is far more terrible than you can imagine it." ...|$|R
6000|$|Winifred {{went up to}} the bed. [...] "Look here, Monty! I don't want to hit you. I don't want to hurt you. I shan't {{allude to}} anything. I'm not going to worry. What's the use?" [...] She was silent a moment. [...] "I can't stand any more, though, and I won't! You'd better know. You've made me suffer. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be fond of you. For the sake of that...." [...] She met the heavy-lidded gaze of his brown eyes with the {{downward}} stare of her green-grey eyes; touched his hand suddenly, turned her back, and went into her room.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, poor Umbleby!" [...] said Mr Bideawhile; [...] "what is {{he doing}} now? I am quite sure your father was right, or he wouldn't have done it; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think that Umbleby was a decent sort of man enough. Not so grand, you know, as your Gazebees and Gumptions--eh, Mr Gresham? They do say young Gazebee is {{thinking}} of getting into Parliament. Let me see: Umbleby married--who was it he married? That was the way your father got hold of him; not your father, but your grandfather. I used to know all about it. Well, I was sorry for Umbleby. He has got something, I suppose--eh?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, indeed, {{seven years}} ago, though it seems but {{yesterday}} {{that my wife}} came back howling and crying, and saying the child had not come back all day. I always thought and said that something of the kind would happen. Jem was a beautiful boy, and everyone made much of him, and my wife {{was so proud of}} him, and liked him to carry the vegetables and things to grand folks' houses, where he was petted and made much of. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> say, [...] "Take care--the town is large, there are plenty of bad people in it--keep a sharp eye on Jem." [...] And so it happened; for one day an old woman came and bought a lot of things--more than she could carry; so my wife, being a kindly soul, lent her the boy, and--we have never seen him since.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Never a real one; <b>but</b> every Thursday <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do sham ones. Once I did a jeweller's {{bill for}} twelve {{thousand}} pounds and odd! It is {{so long since}} I touched a pen, that may be <b>I</b> can't write; <b>but</b> <b>I</b> should like to try.' ...|$|R
5000|$|For {{the roles}} of Richard K. Straker and the vampire Kurt Barlow, James Mason and Reggie Nalder had been on {{producer}} Richard Kobritz's [...] "wish list". Kobritz sent Mason {{a copy of the}} script, who loved the part and his wife, Clarissa Kaye-Mason, was also cast as Marjorie Glick. However, Nalder was less impressed. [...] "The makeup and contact lenses were painful <b>but</b> <b>I</b> got <b>used</b> <b>to</b> them. <b>I</b> liked the money best of all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'At first <b>I</b> was, slightly. <b>But</b> <b>I</b> got <b>used</b> <b>to</b> the solitude. And {{you know}} a sort of commonsense will creep even into timidity. I say to myself {{sometimes}} at night, [...] "If <b>I</b> were anybody <b>but</b> a harmless woman, not worth the trouble of a worm's ghost to appear to me, I should think that every sound I hear was a spirit." [...] But you must see all over my house.' ...|$|R
