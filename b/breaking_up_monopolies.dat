50|$|Under the {{doctrine}} of laissez-faire, antitrust is seen as unnecessary as competition {{is viewed as a}} long-term dynamic process where firms compete against each other for market dominance. In some markets a firm may successfully dominate, but it is because of superior skill or innovativeness. However, according to laissez-faire theorists, when it tries to raise prices to take advantage of its monopoly position it creates profitable opportunities for others to compete. A process of creative destruction begins which erodes the monopoly. Therefore, government should not try to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>monopoly</b> but should allow the market to work.|$|R

Comparing different estimators, we find that time-series based estimators typically result in less clear-cut results, probably driven by a lack of time series variation in measures of competition...|$|E
30|$|Due to {{insufficient}} {{technological innovation}} and systemic reform, lack {{of demand for}} investment capital {{has long been a}} problem in China's real economy and became even worse as financial crisis struck. To solve this contradiction, the government should focus on boosting concrete demand for investment in the real economy, rather than increasing money supply as in Western countries. Concrete demand for investment capital lies in technical and institutional innovation, especially in pushing forward the marketization of the financial system and production elements, in deepening the reform of SOEs and <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>monopolies,</b> and in developing small and medium enterprises by creating a friendly business environment. The short-term policies should, on one hand, encourage investment and, on the other hand, help companies to upgrade technology, improve efficiency and reduce costs. But in reality, China's government opted for an expansionary policy that increased the money supply. Though this brought obvious growth, the price was high. In the long term, proactive fiscal policy cannot introduce more investment demand into China's real economy.|$|E

This sparked interest among other companies in providing services in competition to Eurostar and new services to destinations beyond Paris and Brussels. The only rail carrier to formally propose and secure permission for such a service up to now is Deutsche Bahn, which intends to run services between London and Germany and the Netherlands. The sale of High Speed One by the British Government having effectively nationalised LCR in June 2009 is also likely to stimulate competition on the line.|$|R

40|$|The end of World War II {{ushered in}} a new era for Japan as a global {{economic}} powerhouse. The lost decade of the 1990 ’s coupled with the Asian Financial Crisis of 1997 - 1998 and the Global Recession of 2008 - 2009 further complicated the already dire Japanese economic situation. To address the country’s protracted economic stagnation, Prime Minister Abe has resorted to the Keynesian approach known as “Abenomics ” which focuses on aggressive government spending in public works projects. The rationale behind this is that such investments will lead to creation of jobs needed to lift the economy out of stagnation. The paper starts off by recognizing that economic policies do not exist in a vacuum as there are several variables that impact on them. The essay posits that addressing the economic stagnation in Japan requires a holistic perspective as there is no one-size-fits-all solution. Hence, political, social and cultural factors all have crucial roles to play in shaping the economic policies in Japan. The paper argues that each of these variables must be accorded utmost importance as economic reforms are not stand-alone policies. This research proposes some solutions some of which are: adoption of a points-based immigration system to attract skilled workers, raising the birth rate, introduction a more inclusive policy to encourage more participation of women in the work force, increasing foreign direct investment, opening up the country’s energy, <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> <b>monopolies</b> and the implementation of medical insurance reforms that cater more to the needs of working women. Overall, vision not structure remains the key to recovery in Japan...|$|E
50|$|During the Bushnell administration, Ohio took {{an early}} {{leadership}} role in trust-busting. The Valentine Anti-Trust Act {{was signed into law}} by Bushnell. This Act prohibited price fixing, and production limitation. All of these practices helped businesses by driving up the prices for their products, thus harming the consumer. In addition to Valentine Anti-Trust Act, Bushnell's attorney general pursued the monopolistic practices of the Standard Oil Company in the courts. Eventually, U.S. Senator John Sherman of Ohio introduced the Sherman Antitrust Act in the United States Congress in 1890.

Also, the natural monopoly may not represent the lowest-cost means of producing its products if <b>breaking</b> <b>up</b> the <b>monopoly</b> increases production costs for products that the monopoly does not produce.

5000|$|Distributism {{appears to}} have one of its {{greatest}} influences in anti-trust legislation in America and Europe designed to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>monopolies</b> and excessive concentration of market power in one or only a few companies, trusts, interests, or cartels. Embodying the philosophy explained by Chesterton, above, that too much capitalism means too few capitalists, not too many, America's extensive system of anti-trust legislation seeks to prevent the concentration of market power in a given industry into too-few hands. Requiring that no company gain too great a share of any market {{is an example of how}} distributism has found its way into government policy. The assumption behind this legislation is the idea that having economic activity decentralized among many different industry participants is better for the economy than having one or a few large players in an industry. (Note that anti-trust regulation does take into account cases when only large companies are viable because of the nature of an industry, as in the case of natural monopolies like electricity distribution. It also accepts that mergers and acquisitions may improve consumer welfare; however, it generally prefers more economic agents to fewer, as this generally improves competition.) ...|$|R

5000|$|Ill with {{pneumonia}} and absent from his Senate desk {{during most of}} the spring, sixty-four-year-old La Follette still was a formidable contender. Drawing on a variety of discontents, he could injure the cause of either major party in sections it could ill afford to lose. The long appeal to the farmer in the party platform suggested his major target, but the candidate was addressing every American. In his acceptance speech La Follette urged that military spending be curtailed and soldiers' bonus paid. At the foundation of La Follette's program was an attack on monopolies, which he demanded should be [...] "crushed." [...] His Socialist supporters took this as an attack on the capitalistic system in general; to non-Socialists, including the Senator himself, who believed this encroached on personal liberty, it signified a revival of the policy of trust-busting. The Progressive candidate also called for government ownership of water power and gradual nationalization of the railroads. He also supported the nationalization of cigarette factories and other large industries, strongly supported increased taxation on the wealthy, and supported the right of collective bargaining for factory workers. William Foster, a major figure within the Communist Party, considered La Follette a hopeless reactionary who wanted to <b>break</b> <b>up</b> <b>monopolies</b> and return to an era of small businesses.|$|R
