5|$|The actual {{degree of}} {{authority}} any pirate captain exercised over his crew was questionable, {{as he had}} no access to the procedures and sanctions of admiralty law that supported government captains. Many pirate captains were elected by their crews and could be deposed in the same manner. Because of his ignorance of nautical matters, Bonnet was in an even weaker position than other pirate captains, as is demonstrated by the utter domination Blackbeard exercised over him during their collaboration. During Bonnet's early career, his crew seems to have <b>been</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> loyal to him and to have greatly preferred the more charismatic and experienced Blackbeard.|$|E
5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, which indicates {{that he was at}} least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, it would have <b>been</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Gettysburg, Robert E. Lee had {{established}} a reputation as an almost invincible general, achieving stunning victories against superior numbers—although usually {{at the cost of}} high casualties to his army—during the Seven Days, the Northern Virginia Campaign (including the Second Battle of Bull Run), Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville. Only the Maryland Campaign, with its tactically inconclusive Battle of Antietam, had <b>been</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> successful. Therefore, historians have attempted to explain how Lee's winning streak was interrupted so dramatically at Gettysburg. Although the issue is tainted by attempts to portray history and Lee's reputation in a manner supporting different partisan goals, the major factors in Lee's loss arguably can be attributed to: (1) his overconfidence in the invincibility of his men; (2) the performance of his subordinates, and his management thereof; (3) his failing health, and (4) the performance of his opponent, George G. Meade, and the Army of the Potomac.|$|E

25|$|On this basis, Apatosaurus {{could not}} have had a reptilian {{respiratory}} system, as its tidal volume would have <b>been</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> its dead-space volume, so that stale air was not expelled but was sucked back into the lungs.

Furthermore, an avian system would only need a lung volume of about 600liters while a mammalian one would have required about 2,950liters, which would exceed the estimated 1,700liters of space available in a 30-ton Apatosaurus′ chest.|$|E

25|$|The volcanoes {{comprising}} the Garibaldi chain are {{adjacent to the}} highly populated southwest portion of British Columbia. Unlike the central Cascade Arc, renewed volcanic activity in the Garibaldi Belt at a single feeder to create stratovolcanoes is not typical. Instead, volcanic activity results {{in the formation of}} volcanic fields. Of the entire Cascade Arc, the Garibaldi chain has the lowest rate of volcanic activity. In the past two million years, the volume of erupted material in the Garibaldi Belt has <b>been</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 10% of that in the U.S. states of California and Oregon and about 20% of that within the U.S. state of Washington. As a result, the risk of eruptions throughout this part of the Cascade Arc is minor. Individual volcanoes and volcanic fields remain quiet {{for a long period of}} time and certain vents may never erupt again. However, considerable volcanic activity has taken place in the geologically recent past, most notably the explosive eruption that occurred at Mount Meager 2,350years ago.|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} static aerodynamic {{simulation model}} of the 8 by 8 by 20 ft MILVAN cargo container is determined by combining the wind tunnel data from a 1972 NASA Ames Research Center study taken over the restricted domain (0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to phi <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to 90 degrees; 0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to alpha <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> or equal to 45 degrees) with extrapolation relations derived from the geometric symmetry of rectangular boxes. It is found that the aerodynamics of any attitude can be defined from the aerodynamics at an equivalent attitude in the restricted domain (0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> phi <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 45 degrees; 0 <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> alpha <b>is</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 90 degrees).
