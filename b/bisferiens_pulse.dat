40|$|In {{order to}} study the left {{ventricular}} function in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), mechanocardiographic findings were analyzed in 25 cases of HCM and 35 normal subjects. Based on {{the presence or absence}} of pressure gradient (PG) and hypertension, the patients were divided into 3 groups, i. e., 14 cases of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy (HOCM), 5 cases of hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy with hypertension (HOCM with HT) and 6 cases of hypertrophic nonobstructive cardiomyopathy (nonobst. HCM). The results were as follows: 1) The contour of the carotid pulse tracing (CPT) was divided into four types (three types of bisferiens pulse; A, B and C and no bisferiens pulse; D). The <b>bisferiens</b> <b>pulse</b> existed in 20 out of 25 cases of HCM, and PG was found in descending order, type A, B and C. Since all types, A, B and C, were observed in nonobst. HCM, it seems that the <b>bisferiens</b> <b>pulse</b> is not caused by left ventricular outflow-tract-stenosis alone. The systolic second wave (SSW) in the apexcardiogram (ACG) at rest or following isoproterenol (IP) infusion was found in 12 cases, including 3 cases of nonobst. HCM. Therefore, it was concluded that the SSW was not pathognomonic in HOCM. The bulge and absence of the rapid filling wave (RFW) were found in 22 cases and 17 out of 25 cases of HCM, respectively. These results suggested the existence of asynergy and a decrease in left ventricular compliance in HCM. 2) The "a/T" ratio showed markedly higher values in HOCM, HOCM with HT and nonobst. HCM, when compared with normal subjects, but no significant differences were observed among the three groups of HCM. 3) "t-time" (the time from initial upstroke (U-point) to one half of the total height of CPT) was significantly shortened in HOCM, but not significantly changed in either HOCM with HT or nonobst. HCM, when compared with normal subjects. The results suggested the presence of the hyperkinetic state during the initial ejection phase in HOCM. This was supported by the fact that the isovolumetric contraction period (ICP) was shortened significantly in HOCM. ETc was significantly shortened, PEPc lengthened and PEP/ET increased in nonobst. HCM. These results suggested that there might be an inflow disturbance into the left ventricle due to a decrease of left ventriccular compliance and the decrease of the stroke volume in nonobst. HCM. 4) Following IP infusion, the changes in ETc increased significantly in HOCM, while they decreased in normal subjects, which suggested that left ventricular outflow tract stenosis might be augumented by the inotropic action of IP...|$|E
50|$|In medicine, pulsus <b>bisferiens,</b> also bisferious <b>pulse</b> or biphasic pulse, {{is a sign}} where, on {{palpation}} of the pulse, {{a double}} peak per cardiac cycle can be appreciated. Bisferious means striking twice. Classically, it is detected when aortic insufficiency exists in association with aortic stenosis, but may {{also be found in}} isolated but severe aortic insufficiency, and hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy.|$|R
