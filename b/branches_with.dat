5|$|As an {{arboreal}} lizard, V. salvadorii {{can hang}} onto <b>branches</b> <b>with</b> its rear legs and occasionally use its tail as a prehensile grip. The primary {{use of the}} tail, however, is to counterbalance its weight when leaping from one branch to another. The tail may {{also be used for}} defense, as captive specimens have attempted to whip their keepers with their tails. This species is occasionally seen in the pet trade, but has earned a reputation of being aggressive and unpredictable. Although they are known to rest and bask in trees, they sleep on the ground or submerged in water.|$|E
5|$|By 1881, Stanley was {{employing}} 80 {{people and}} producing 3,000 technical items, as detailed in his catalogue. A few years later, in 1885, Stanley {{was given a}} {{gold medal at the}} International Inventors Exhibition at Wembley. The rapid growth of his business led to the opening of branches at Lincoln's Inn, at London Bridge and at South Norwood. His 1890 catalogue shows that the company were selling Magic Lanterns, with a variety of slides including such subjects as the Siege of Paris (1870–1871), the travels of Dr Livingstone and Dante's Inferno, as well as improving stories for children such as Mother's Last Words and The Drunkard's Children, while in the catalogue for 1891, Stanley refers to the company having 17 <b>branches,</b> <b>with</b> over 130 workmen.|$|E
5|$|One major {{distinguishing}} feature between all loris species is locomotion: the Sunda slow loris moves slowly through trees {{on all four}} limbs, typically with three limbs attached to a support at a time. Its movement {{has been described as}} unique; similar to crawling, or as if it was climbing in every direction, the Sunda slow loris changes direction or moves between <b>branches</b> <b>with</b> little noise or change in speed. In captivity, about a quarter of its time is spent moving quadrupedally, a quarter suspended or hanging, a quarter climbing, and a quarter clasping multiple branches (bridging). It may hang below a branch by one or both feet for long periods of time.|$|E

5|$|The Student Government Association {{presides over}} and funds the over 300 student clubs and {{organizations}} and honor societies {{at the university}} and has an operating budget of over $14million. The Student Government Association is split into three <b>branches,</b> <b>with</b> the Executive, a Legislative Student Senate, and Judicial Supreme Court. Due to the unique nature of a multi-campus university, the President of Modesto Maidique Campus (University Park) serves as the Student Representative on the University's Board of Trustees, while the President for the Biscayne Bay Campus serves {{as a member of}} the Foundation Board.|$|E
5|$|While {{the pelvis}} {{is not entirely}} {{like that of a}} human (being {{markedly}} wide, or flared, with laterally orientated iliac blades), these features point to a structure radically remodelled to accommodate a significant degree of bipedalism. The femur angles in toward the knee from the hip. This trait allows the foot to fall closer to the midline of the body, and strongly indicates habitual bipedal locomotion. Present-day humans, orangutans and spider monkeys possess this same feature. The feet feature adducted big toes, making it difficult if not impossible to grasp <b>branches</b> <b>with</b> the hindlimbs. Besides locomotion, A. afarensis also had a slightly larger brain than a modern chimpanzee (the closest living relative of humans) and had teeth that were more human than ape-like.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton {{recruited}} John Jay and James Madison {{to write}} a series of essays defending the proposed Constitution, now known as The Federalist Papers, and made the largest contribution to that effort, writing 51 of 85 essays published (Madison wrote 29, Jay only five). Hamilton supervised the entire project, enlisted the participants, wrote {{the majority of the}} essays, and oversaw the publication. During the project each person was responsible for their areas of expertise. Jay covered foreign relations, Madison covered the history of republics and confederacies, along with the anatomy of the new government and Hamilton covered the branches of government most pertinent to him: the executive and judicial <b>branches,</b> <b>with</b> some aspects of the Senate, as well as covering military matters and taxation The papers first appeared in The Independent Journal on October 27, 1787.|$|E

5|$|Slow lorises have a {{powerful}} grasp with both their hands and feet due to several specializations. They can tightly grasp <b>branches</b> <b>with</b> little effort because of a special muscular arrangement in their hands and feet, where the thumb diverges at nearly 180° {{from the rest of}} the fingers, while the hallux (big toe) ranges between being perpendicular and pointing slightly backwards. The toes have a large flexor muscle that originates on the lower end of the thigh bone, which helps to impart a strong grasping ability to the hind limbs. The second digit of the hand is short compared to the other digits, while on the foot, the fourth toe is the longest. The sturdy thumb helps to act like a clamp when digits three, four, and five grasp the opposite side of a tree branch. This gives their hands and feet a pincer-like appearance. The strong grip can be held for hours without losing sensation due to the presence of a rete mirabile (network of capillaries), a trait shared among all lorises. Both slender and slow lorises have relatively short feet. Like nearly all lemuriforms, they have a grooming claw on the second toe of each foot.|$|E
5|$|The giraffe's neck {{vertebrae}} have {{ball and}} socket joints. In particular, the atlas–axis joint (C1 and C2) allows the animal to tilt its head vertically and reach more <b>branches</b> <b>with</b> the tongue. The point of articulation between the cervical and thoracic vertebrae of giraffes is shifted to lie {{between the first and}} second thoracic vertebrae (T1 and T2), unlike most other ruminants where the articulation is between the seventh cervical vertebra (C7) and T1. This allows C7 to contribute directly to increased neck length and has given rise to the suggestion that T1 is actually C8, and that giraffes have added an extra cervical vertebra. However, this proposition is not generally accepted, as T1 has other morphological features, such as an articulating rib, deemed diagnostic of thoracic vertebrae, and because exceptions to the mammalian limit of seven cervical vertebrae are generally characterised by increased neurological anomalies and maladies.|$|E
5|$|Distinctive {{features}} of Ramaria botrytis include its large size, the orange, reddish, or purplish branchlets, striate spores with dimensions averaging 13.8 by 4.7µm, and a weak amyloid staining {{reaction of the}} stem tissue. R.rubripermanens has reddish terminal branches, a stout form, and striate spores, but may be distinguished from R.botrytis by its much shorter spores. Other species with which R.botrytis may be confused include: R.formosa, which has branches that are pinker than R.botrytis, and yellow-tipped; R.caulifloriformis, found in the Great Lakes region of the United States, whose branch tips darken with age; R.strasseri, which has yellow to brown branch tips; R.rubrievanescens, which has branches in which the pink color fades after picking or in mature fruit bodies; and R.botrytoides, which is most reliably distinguished from R.botrytis by its smooth spores. The European species R.rielii, often confused with R.botrytis and sometimes considered synonymous, can be distinguished by microscopic characteristics: R.reilii lacks the clamped hyphae of R.botrytis, its spores are longer and wider, and they have warts instead of striations. The North American species R.araiospora, though superficially similar to R.botrytis, has several distinguishing characteristics: it grows under hemlock; it has reddish to magenta <b>branches</b> <b>with</b> orange to yellowish tips; it lacks any discernible odor; it has warted, somewhat cylindrical spores averaging 9.9 by 3.7µm; and it has non-amyloid stem tissue. Uniformly colored bright pink to reddish, R.subbotrytis has spores measuring 7–9 by 3–3.5µm.|$|E

5|$|Picking {{up where}} Subspecies II leaves off, Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994) finds Michelle {{deep in the}} catacombs with Radu's mother, who brings her son {{back from the dead}} with Michelle's blood and the enchanted dagger that killed him; Radu, his mother, and Michelle return to Castle Vladislas. Michelle {{promises}} to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a body bag that was brought along; the delay allows Radu time to catch up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu's burning corpse is left smoldering and impaled on tree <b>branches,</b> <b>with</b> his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.|$|E
