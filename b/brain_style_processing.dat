However, typical parallel artificial neural network (ANN) simulations show only poor speedup on most parallel computers.

In this paper we give parallel simulation techniques and partitioning strategies for PCNNs. Furthermore, a parallel PVM simulator and a special network description compiler are presented. The speedup of simulation is shown by typical example networks of large vision PCNNs on SUN workstation clusters and a massively parallel Pentium II cluster computer. The fast and simple simulation environment allows the simulation of large PCNNs with simulation times near to real time...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study were to explore whether: 1) the right <b>brain</b> {{learning}} <b>style</b> is related to creative thinking and 2) the left <b>brain</b> learning <b>style</b> is related to critical thinking. In this study, <b>brain</b> learning <b>style</b> was measured by the Yanpiaw 'Brain Style' test (YBRAINS) and the Styles of Learning and Thinking test (SOLAT), while creative thinking and critical thinking were measured by three thinking skills instruments, the Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT), the Watson-Glaser Critical Thinking Appraisal (WGCTA) and the Yanpiaw 'Creative-Critical Styles' test (YCREATIVE-CRITICALS). As the second purpose, this study permitted analyses of the relationships between 1) the two types of <b>brain</b> learning <b>style</b> tests and 2) the three types of thinking skills tests. The five instruments were administered to 102 undergraduates. Results indicated that TTCT scores were positively correlated with right <b>brain</b> <b>style</b> scores of the YBRAINS and SOLAT, while the WGCTA scores were positively correlated with left <b>brain</b> <b>style</b> scores of the YBRAINS and SOLAT. Results also indicated positive relationships between the two <b>brain</b> <b>styles</b> tests on both left and right brain scores. The results demonstrated that the left <b>brain</b> learning <b>style</b> is related to critical thinking, while the right <b>brain</b> learning <b>style</b> is related to creative thinking. The present data are consistent with the notions that people who learn and think with right brain are creative. Since competence in creative thinking and critical thinking skills are essential to nearly every aspect of learning in every society, educators should implement whole brain learning strategies, instead of encourage merely the left, or the right brain learning strategies...|$|R

However, recent studies suggest that creative thinking or problem solving requires both left and right <b>styles</b> of <b>processing</b> information. One hundred and twenty-five male and female college students enrolled in introductory psychology classes took the following four tests: Something About Myself (Khatena & Torrance, 1976), a checklist of creative achievements and behaviors; What Kind of a Person Are You? (Khatena & Torrance, 1978), a measure of the creative personality style; the Human Information Processing Survey (Taggart & Torrance, 1984), a scale classifying subjects according to learning style into four categories of cerebral dominance - right, left, integrated and mixed; and The Creative Imagination Scale (Wilson & Barber, 1978), an instrument that measures ability to imagine, for example, that an arm is heavy, a finger is numb, and that time is slowing down. It was hypothesized that subjects who report an integrated <b>style</b> of <b>processing</b> information would score higher on the measures of creativity than the other two groups.

40|$|Abstract—The wide {{availability}} and the Single-Instruction Multiple-Thread (SIMT) -style programming model have made graphics processing units (GPUs) a promising choice for high performance computing. However, {{because of the}} SIMT <b>style</b> <b>processing,</b> an instruction will be executed in every thread even if the operands are identical for all the threads. To overcome this inefficiency, the AMD’s latest Graphics Core Next (GCN) architecture integrates a scalar unit into a SIMT unit. In GCN, both the SIMT unit and the scalar unit share a single SIMT-style instruction stream. Depending on its type, an instruction is issued to either a scalar or a SIMT unit. In this paper, we propose to extend the scalar unit {{so that it can}} either share the instruction stream with the SIMT unit or execute a separate instruction stream. The program to be executed by the scalar unit is referred to as a scalar program and its purpose is to assist SIMT-unit execution. The scalar programs are either generated from SIMT programs automatically by the compiler or manually developed by expert developers. We make a case for our proposed flexible scalar unit through three collaborative execution paradigms: data prefetching, control divergence elimination, and scalar-workload extraction. Our experimental results show that significant performance gains can be achieved using our proposed approaches compared to the state-of-art SIMT <b>style</b> <b>processing.</b> Keywords-GPGPU; scalar unit; SIMT; Vector unit I...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pain is a {{commonly}} reported symptom following surgery {{that is more}} likely to occur in individuals psychologically distressed prior to surgery. Monitoring <b>processing</b> <b>style,</b> a cognitive tendency to focus on health-related threats, has been associated with increased reporting of somatic symptoms, but no studies have specifically addressed the link between this cognitive style and pain. This prospective clinical study aimed to investigate whether monitoring <b>processing</b> <b>style</b> predicted post-surgical pain in women undergoing breast surgery, controlling for pre-surgical psychological distress. Methods: Women scheduled to undergo breast cancer surgery (N[*]=[*] 106) completed pre-surgical assessments of monitoring <b>processing</b> <b>style</b> (Miller Behavioral Style Scale) and psychological distress (Depression Anxiety Stress Scales- 21). Demographic and medical characteristics were documented. Self-reported neuropathic pain (Neuropathic Pain Scale) was assessed at 3 months post surgery. Results: Post-surgical neuropathic pain levels were low to moderate (M[*]=[*] 19. 3, SD[*]=[*] 21. 1). Higher pre-surgical monitoring <b>processing</b> <b>style</b> scores significantly predicted higher post-surgical neuropathic pain (β[*]=[*] 0. 23, p[*]=[*] 0. 023), over and above psychological stress (β[*]=[*] 0. 22, p[*]=[*] 0. 020) and age (β[*]=[*]− 0. 25, p[*]=[*] 0. 011). Conclusions: Pre-surgical monitoring <b>processing</b> <b>style</b> was an independent predictor of post-surgical neuropathic pain, even when accounting for pre-surgical psychological distress. Since the reduction of post-surgical pain is a key goal of healthcare, efforts should be made prior to breast cancer surgery to counsel and support individuals with high monitoring <b>processing</b> <b>styles</b> irrespective of their level of distress. 8 page(s...|$|R

40|$|The {{predictive}} {{relationship between}} the use of an informational identity <b>processing</b> <b>style</b> and wisdom was examined by focusing specifically on the mediating roles of self-reflective capacities (self-reflection, insight, mindfulness, and self-compassion).

The use of an information style was positively related to all self-reflective capacities and to wisdom. In addition, each of the reflective capacities partially mediated the relationship between informational identity processing and wisdom.

40|$|Academic {{performance}} of first year university {{students in the}} international arena as well as locally, has been a point of concern for all stakeholders because of high dropout rates and failure. Although many explanations for this have been offered and accepted, all have located the problem external to the individual. This study examined the interplay between interpersonal and intrapersonal factors on academic {{performance of}} first year university students in South Africa. A sociocognitive perspective was employed by an investigation of student identity <b>processing</b> <b>styles</b> as a means to explain academic performance. A mixed sample of 419 first year psychology students at a South African university was randomly chosen.

30|$|Another {{important}} set of homologues {{between the}} left and right hemispheres are the differences in the types of information processing specialization and their <b>processing</b> <b>styles.</b> The left hemisphere is said to process information in a sequential, analytic manner, whereas the right hemisphere uses a simultaneous holistic <b>style</b> of <b>processing</b> (Bradshaw and Nettleton 1981).The left hemisphere is widely known for rapid, impersistent processing with a specialization for logical, linguistic speech, while the right hemisphere is widely known for slow, persistent processing with a specialization for spatial information such as faces and places.

40|$|Background and Objectives: The {{degree of}} (over) {{generalization}} (to the self, over situations) {{is an important}} characteristic of depression and anxiety disorders. Little is known about cognitive mechanisms underlying this (over) generalization. In this context, the present study examined the effect of an abstract <b>processing</b> <b>style</b> (compared to a more concrete <b>processing</b> <b>style)</b> on generalization of angry faces to the self. An abstract <b>processing</b> <b>style</b> refers to thoughts about the meaning, causes and consequences of events or situations (‘Why’-thinking). Methods: To test the impact of an abstract processing experimentally, images of angry faces were paired {{with the name of}} the participant and happy faces were paired with another person’s name while participants adopted either an abstract (‘Why’) or a concrete (‘How’) <b>processing</b> <b>style.</b> A surprise recognition task, where participants were asked to indicate whether they had seen the faces before, served as a test of generalization of angry faces to the self. Results: Results indicated that participants who adopted an abstract <b>processing</b> <b>style</b> showed more generalization of angry faces to the self and a trend towards more generalization of happy faces to the other person, relative to participants who adopted a concrete <b>processing</b> <b>style.</b> Limitations: Our sample was a non-clinical student sample and thus conclusions about the generalizability to clinical samples should be done with caution.
