30|$|It is {{a surface}} mine in {{southern}} Illinois that produces about 4  million tons of clean coal {{per year and}} 1  million tons of coal processing waste per year. The mining depth is 30  m and the coal seam (Murphysboro seam) being mined has thickness of 1.8  m. The mine has shale and limestone as roof and claystone as floor. Coarse refuse (CCPW) {{is based on a}} mixture of <b>bone</b> <b>coal</b> and shale parting material {{with a small amount of}} dark shale, and large amount of relatively coarse, light gray-color claystone fragments. Large amounts of coarse-grained pyrite is observed as bands in mined coal. Fine refuse (FCPW) is also rich in fine-grained pyrite as observed around the FCPW pipe discharge area. A portion of the coal from this site is mined with a high-wall miner system from a box cut. This system employs an underground mining-type continuous miner that is remotely operated from the surface. As a result this mine produces ROM coal that has a higher OSD than a typical Illinois surface mine.|$|E
40|$|Fluorine {{concentration}} and other parameters in groundwater were assessed and {{attempts were made}} to clarify the relationship between fluorine (Fl) and seawater intrusion in coastal area of Laizhou Bay, China by comparing samples in fluorosis and non-fluorosis areas. The water from fluorosis villages reflects the influence of seawater intrusion and higher levels of conductivity (Ec), total dissolved solids (TDS), hardness (TH), Cl-, Br-, HCO 3 -, Li+, Na+, Mg 2 +, and Sr 2 +. High Fl concentration was positive correlated with Ec, TDS, Cl-, Br-, Li+, Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, Sr 2 + and significantly with Na+, Na+/Ca 2 +, and sodium adsorption ratio. This investigation also observed that seawater intrusion and fluorosis show similar distribution and originating sources. Thus, the special process-seawater intrusion seems to be an important dynamic of Fl enrichment by changing chemical characters and enhancing Fl release ability. Moreover, the water treated by <b>bone</b> <b>coal</b> adsorption still maintains high risk of Ec, Na+, and TDS, even though Fl was within the safe limit. This study indicates that in Laizhou Bay, together with other coastal areas, seawater intrusion is a cause for concern when examining mechanism underlying fluorosis occurrence and developing integrated treatment technology.

40|$|Over 800 mud-filled casts of upright lycopsid tree stumps {{have been}} {{documented}} immediately above the Mahoning coal in an active underground mine located in northwestern Jefferson County, Ohio. The coal body originated as a pod-shaped peat body of ~ 60 km^. Trees are rooted at several levels within a thin (15 - 40 cm) <b>bone</b> <b>coal</b> directly above the banded coal; they extend upward up to 15 cm into overlying, flat-bedded, carbonaceous mudstones that coarsen up. From a maximum basal diameter of 1. 2 m, stumps taper upward to diameters no less than 0. 3 m. Within single-entry transects, < 6 m wide that total 2585 m in length, stumps are randomly distributed. The trees are identified as lepidodendrids {{on the basis of}} gross morphology, external stem patterns, and attached stigmarian root systems, and provisionally as Lepidophloios or Lepidoden-dron by associated palynology of the enclosing matrix. Palynological analyses of incremental seam samples indicate an initial dominance of lycopsid spores with lepidodendracean affinities (Lycospora granulata from Lepidophloios hallii), replaced upwards by tree-fern spores, with a reoccurrence of lepidodendracean spores in the upper benches; spores of Sigillaria {Crassispora) are abundant only {{at the base of the}} coal. Petrographic analyses indicate a parallel trend from vitrinite-rich to inertinite- and Uptinite-rich upward in the coal body. All data indicate that the peat represented by the Mahoning coal was drowned slowly. During the earliest stages of inundation, a lycopsid forest was re-established, only to be subsequently drowned.

S. coal mines is crucial for developing a sound engineering rib support design tool. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze the current practices of rib control in U. S. coal mines. Twenty underground coal mines were studied representing various coal basins, coal seams, geology, loading conditions, and rib control strategies. The key findings are: (1) any rib design guideline or tool should take into account external rib support as well as internal bolting; (2) rib bolts on their own cannot contain rib spall, especially in soft ribs subjected to significant load-external rib control devices such as mesh are required in such cases to contain rib sloughing; (3) the majority of the studied mines follow the overburden depth and entry height thresholds recommended by the Program Information Bulletin 11 - 29 issued by the Mine Safety and Health Administration; (4) potential rib instability occurred when certain geological features prevailed-these include draw slate and/or <b>bone</b> <b>coal</b> near the rib/roof line, claystone partings, and soft coal bench overlain by rock strata; (5) 47 % of the studied rib spall was classified as blocky-this could indicate a high potential of rib hazards; and (6) rib injury rates of the studied mines for the last three years emphasize the need for more rib control management for mines operating at overburden depths between 152. 4 m and 304. 8 m.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} if miners were at risk from exposures to chemicals used in the mining industry and determine the nature and sources of the illnesses and injuries. The U. S. Mine Safety and Health Administration s (MSHA) employment and accident, injury and illness database was reviewed. There were 2, 705 cases of chemical-related injuries and illnesses reported from 1999 through 2006, involving 66 different chemicals. The main source (cause) of chemical-related cases was acids/alkalis (about 39 %). The primary nature (effect) of chemical-related cases was chemical burns (about 57 %). The job classification where workers incurred the most chemical-related injuries and illnesses was cleaning plant operator/media operator/boney preparation plant operator/crusher worker (cleaning plant operators are responsible for maintenance of plants, media operators are responsible for handling reagents, boney preparation plant operators oversee removal of <b>bone</b> from <b>coal,</b> and crusher workers use large crushers to break mined material). From 1999 through 2006, the rate of nonfatal days lost and no days lost (resulting from injuries) did not change significantly; however, the rate of illnesses decreased significantly. Chemical burns accounted for a large number of injuries; mining companies should carefully examine their personal protective equipment (PPE) requirements, training methods and safety culture to ensure that their workers are protected...|$|R

Middens developed along rivers, {{but there}} is limited evidence of Archaic peoples along coastlines prior to 3000 BCE. Archaic Kentucky natives' social groups were small, consisting of a few cooperating families. The large shell middens, artifact caches, human and dog burials, and burnt clay flooring prove Archaic natives lived in permanent locations. The white-tailed deer, mussels, fish, oysters, turtles, and the elk were the dominant game animals of Archaic natives.

Hominy holes were a depression worn in sandstone by grinding or pulverizing, and it was used for grinding up hickory nuts or seed.|$|R

The effectiveness of the stabilization treatment was evaluated using the Korean Standard Test (KST). The KST tests were performed using 1 N HCl extraction fluid for As and 0. 1 N HCl extraction fluid for Pb. Scanning electron microscopy–energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (SEM–EDX) analyses were performed to investigate the mechanism responsible for As and Pb immobilization upon treatment. The treatment results showed that effective stabilization of As and Pb-contaminated sediment was obtained. Specifically, 10 wt% COS– 5 wt% CMDS was the best treatment for As immobilization and 5 wt% COS– 5 wt% WCB was the best treatment for Pb immobilization. The COS–WCB treatment outperformed the COS–CMDS treatment in immobilizing Pb in the contaminated sediment. SEM–EDX results indicated that Pb immobilization was strongly associated with Ca, Si, Al and P while As immobilization was strongly associated with Fe and O. Therefore, utilization of COS, WCB and CMDS is beneficial for the stabilization of contaminated sediment. PublishedN/...|$|R
30|$|Activated carbon {{can be said}} to be a non-selective {{adsorbent}} that adsorbs {{virtually all}} the natural organic materials which are found in waters which leads to a decline in its ability to accumulate or adsorb toxic organics (Ilisz et al. 2002). Activated carbon is described as a wide range of amorphous carbon based materials designed to possess a high level of porosity and an extended inter-particulate surface area (Bansal et al. 1988). These characteristics equip the activated carbon with excellent adsorbent capabilities and it is basically defined more or less by its properties rather than its sources, as it can be prepared from a large number of carbon-rich raw materials that can be of animal, mineral or agricultural wastes origins (Austin 1987), which maybe include tree, peat, <b>coal,</b> <b>bones,</b> coconut shells and fruit stones. Activated carbon prepared from coconut coir pith has been determined to efficient for the treatment of wastewater as well for the adsorption of As, Cu, Hg, Ni and organics from aqueous solution (Namasivayam and Kardirverlu 1998). Activated carbons produced using rice husk and coconut husk and sawdust have been used for the treatment of wastewater on various occasions (Raji et al. 1997).|$|R

Standing up to gaze once more on the prospect, I noticed a small wreath of white smoke issuing from a spot about the middle of the forest belt beneath me, and I instantly divined that Nuflo had made a fire at that place, and I resolved to surprise him in his retreat. When I got down {{to the base of the}} hill the smoke could no longer be seen, but I had studied the spot well from above, and had singled out a large clump of trees on the edge of the belt as a starting-point; and after a search of half an hour I succeeded in finding the old man's hiding-place. First I saw smoke again through an opening in the trees, then a small rude hut of sticks and palm leaves. Approaching cautiously, I peered through a crack and discovered old Nuflo engaged in smoking some meat over a fire, and at the same time grilling some <b>bones</b> on the <b>coals.</b> He had captured a coatimundi, an animal somewhat larger than a tame tom-cat, with a long snout and long ringed tail; one of the dogs was gnawing at the animal's head, and the tail and the feet were also lying on the floor, among the old bones and rubbish that littered it. Stealing round, I suddenly presented myself at the opening to his den, when the dogs rose up with a growl and Nuflo instantly leaped to his feet, knife in hand.|$|R
40|$|Fuel (wood, <b>bone,</b> dung and <b>coal)</b> and the {{selection}} of {{it has always been}} an integral part in the lifeways of nomadic pastoralists. Certainly, the gathering of fuel, the storage of it, and its eventual use represents a large part of daily culture. Yet, it remains an understudied aspect of ancient household economies. This is unfortunate since understanding fuel selection and use can also serve to evaluate specific cultural practices and human-­‐environment relationships since there is often a close link between specific types of available fuel and local environmental conditions. Through ethnoarchaeological research in the Altai region of western Mongolia, information about local use of fuel in a domestic setting was gained. Based on current archaeological research it is believed that present-­‐day inhabitants in the Altai region share a similar nomadic pastoralist mode of subsistence with the people living in this same region during the Late Bronze/Early Iron Age (mid-­‐Second to mid-­‐First millennia BC). Local lake core data also suggests that the Bronze and Early Iron Age environmental landscape in this region was fairly similar to that of today. These similarities allow us to infer that Bronze and Iron Age societies possibly had an overall domestic economy similar to the modern people of this region, thus allowing us to evaluate both iii past and present human-­‐environment relationships. By gaining information regarding traditional ecological knowledge and the traditional importance of dung as a fuel source in this semi-­‐arid region (largely devoid of wood) it is possible to gain insights about environmental and domestic economic sustainability...|$|R
40|$|U radu se daju rezultati istraživanja prapovijesnog naselja Mačkovac - Crišnjevi (Nova Gradiška) koja su se odvijala u razdoblju od 1997. do 2001. godine, a nastavljaju se i dalje. Na osnovi nalaza keramike i metalnih predmeta naselje se datira u stupanj Br C i D, s nešto elemenata Ha A. Naselje je kulturno srodno drugim nalazištima grupe Barice - Gređani i Virovitica. The village Mačkovac is {{situated}} on the left, Croatian bank of the Sava River, approximately 15 km south of Nova Gradiška. It was first mentioned in the literature already {{at the end of}} the 19 th century, parallel to a hoard of bronze artifacts found at the Klupko site (Ilić-Oriovčanin, 1874; Ljubić, 1889). This was the first in a series of hoards found in the neighboring area. It was published in 1973 (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 73), along with the hoard from the neighboring village Siče (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 95). The third hoard from this area, from Dolina on the Sava, was published by Schauer in 1974. The locality {{is situated}} 1 km north of the village, on a site called Crišnjevi, 92 m above sea level, thus topping a floodplain at 90 m above sea level. It covers approximately 2 hectares of land. On its southern side it is defined by the natural depression called Prišnjica, in which water accumulates throughout most of the year, making access to the settlement difficult. In the surrounding area there are a few other sites with Late Bronze Age pottery. In the vicinity there are two more sites, Glavičica with tumuli, and the Late Bronze Age settlement Babine Grede. In 1985 another hoard was uncovered on Crišnjevi (Karavanić and Mihaljević, 2001), which brought about trial excavations in 1997. Its interesting results contributed to the continuation of excavations. Up to the present day, 323 m 2 have been investigated. Over the years many pottery objects, animal remains, a human tooth (verbal communication by M. Šlaus) and several bronze objects were unearthed. Three layers can be distinguished at the site. The surface layer consists of humus damaged by plowing, with pottery and daub finds. Beneath this comes a dark brown, almost black clay layer with plenty of daub, pottery and charcoal, representing a cultural deposit settled in the area outside or above the settlement facilities. On the bottom there is a layer with many animal <b>bones</b> and <b>coal.</b> On Crišnjevi no remains of above-ground houses were uncovered, but only of smaller furnaces. One furnace has a regular oval ground plan, with two layers of a 20 cm thick clay coat, whereas others were made of a substruction of pottery fragments and a 2 - 3 cm thick clay coat. Above the furnace with the thicker coat there was an implosion made of daub fragments and parts of furnace. In the implosion a bronze ingot and a bellows nozzle (T. 2, 14) were found, and in the vicinity dross fragments as well, indicating metallurgical activity in this part of the settlement. In 2000 and 2001, a 15 cm thick stratum of hard, packed clay was unearthed above the bottom layer, on which there was a furnace (Fig. 2), as well as numerous heaps of pottery and daub fragments. The earth in this stratum was obviously leveled in order to create a surface for specific economic activities in the settlement; thus it might have been a house surface, within which there were smaller fireplaces and furnaces. In it only a limited number of finds was unearthed, only a few pottery and daub fragments. Considering the excavated surface, a relatively large number of metal objects was unearthed in Mačkovac. Those were mostly bronze needles. Thus regular sewing needles were found, as well as two needles with a biconical head (Vrdoljak, Mihaljević, 2000, Fig. 2, 1 - 6). Needles with a simple biconical head as well as those with a rounded head are simple, long-lasting utensils. Apart from a few exceptions, these needles cannot be used for accurate dating. In Moravia they were dated in early Urnfield culture, and in Hungary, in the hoards Romand and Velemszentvid, in late Urnfield culture. The needle (T. 4, 5) would correspond to the Deinsdorf type (Říhovský, 1979; Innerhofer 2000). Most similar to the needle from Mačkovac is that from grave-mound I, from a skeletal grave at the Velke Hosteradky site (Říhovský, 1963, 66, T. 1,; B 6). Similar needles were also found in the Polešovice hoard in Moravia (Salaš, 1997, T. 23, 574 - 577), where they were dated in late grave-mound culture and early Urnfield culture (Salaš, 1997, 40). Needles of the same type were also found at other localities in northern Croatia, e. g. in Ilok (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, 180, T. 19, 1 - 2), Bogdanovci (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 19, 3), and Slavonski Brod (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T 19, 4). These needles, along with other finds, correspond with the group of finds representing the Middle Bronze Age basis for the development of Urnfield culture and are dated into the end of the Middle Bronze Age and the beginning of the Late Bronze Age. Apart from those needles, there is also a needle from the Virovitica site (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 10, 10) that represents the Middle Bronze Age needle type with a nailshaped head which Teržan used as an argument for dating the beginning of the Virovitica group in the period Br B 2 -C (Teržan, 1995, 327). The most numerous group of finds in Mačkovac is pottery. The paper gives a selection of finds from all these years. Pot types found in Mačkovac are distributed over a large territory and in different Urnfield culture groups. Mostly we are dealing with pots with a rounded body and an everted rim, of different sizes, with one or two ribboned grips beneath the rim. Often they are decorated with a horizontal rib or a plastic ribbon with finger-prints (T. 1, 7), sometimes combined with a vertical ribbon, which is connected with the rim. The same forms of pots are found in the settlement Oloris (Dular, 2002), in Laminci near Bosanska Gradiška (Čović, 1983, 65 - 70, T 1; Đurđević, 1987, 50) and Saghegy (Patek, 1968). Interesting are pots decorated by clustered applications at the bottom (T. 3, 4), which are also found at the Laminci locality (Čović, 1983, 65 - 70). Such applied ornaments also occur in Transdanubia at the Gelsesziget site within the gravemound culture (Laszlo, 1994, 226), as well as at the Urnfield culture necropolis Voers-Battyani (Honti, 1993, 152, 155). Bowls are represented with a much richer repertoire of forms. Several varieties of rounded bowls with a flat rim (B 3 a, B 3 b, B 3 e) and one with an everted, horizontally flattened rim (B 3 d) were out. They occur in the early Urnfield culture settlements of Oloris (Dular, 2002) and Saghegy (Patek, 1968), as well as at the necropoli of Barice (Čović, 1958) and Mala Brusnica (Belić, 1963 - 1964). The bowl variety of rough manufacturing, with thicker walls and a flat bottom with vertical, horn-shaped protrusions (B 3 c) (T. 3, 2) has no closer analogies. Řihovsky mentions them in his work as an element of the grave-mound culture which was conveyed into early Urnfield culture, the Blučina-Kopčany horizon (Říhovský, 1982, 17, 42). Patek dates them as early as Br C and defines them as a form conveyed from gravemound culture (Patek, 1968, 102, T. 1, T. 6). Bowls with a broadly ribboned rim (B 6), a regular find on each necropolis of the Virovitica and Barice-Gređani groups, were also found in Mačkovac, and they appear in early Urnfield culture since Br C. Among them is also a fragment decorated with an oval knob in the interior (T. 3, 7). Deep bowls with a rounded (B 5 a) (T. 1, 1 - 2, 4 - 6; T. 4, 2, 4) or slightly biconical (B 5 b) (T. 1, 3; T. 4, 1, 3) belly account for more than a third of all bowls in Mačkovac and are the most remarkable vessels at the site. They were all reductionally baked, they may have one or two ribboned grips, the portion where the belly turns into the neck is accentuated by a shallow groove, and often their belly is decorated with oval, knob-shaped protrusions (German Buckel) surrounded by a groove. Similar bowls were found in the necropoli of the Barice-Gređani group (Minichreiter, 1982, T. 4, 6, 8, 15), the necropoli in the surroundings of Bjelovar (Majnarić-Pandžić, 1988, 18 - 23), in Virovitica and Sirova Katalena (Vinski-Gasparini, 1973, T. 8, 15), and Moravče near Sesvete (Sokol, 1996, Fig. 13, 14). Particularly interesting is the analogy of bowls from Vinkovci (Dimitrijević, 1979, 141) that opened a number of questions pertaining to their chronological and cultural position. It is a chance find, culturally determined already in 1966 (Dimitrijević, 1966, 68) as part of the Hatvanoid- Bebrin culture and dated into Br A 2 and Br A 3. The scientific literature leans on this opinion due to a lack of investigation (Dimitrijević, 1979; Čović, 1983), or refers to it as Brod culture (Petrović, 1970; Belić, 1968; Lozuk, 1993, 2000), persisting upon dating into the Early Bronze Age. Bosnian literature, after the excavation in Laminci, subscribes the earlier published finds to Urnfield culture (Čović, 1988; Đurđević, 1987). After having studied the materials preserved in the Brodsko Posavlje Museum and comparing them to all the published localities it can be concluded that we are dealing with pottery artifacts from a settlement which is notably related to those from the Mačkovac-Crišnjevi site and therefore chronologically classified as belonging to the end of the Middle Bronze Age and the beginning of the Late Bronze Age, concurrent with the Virovitica group and culturally belonging to the Barice-Gređani group. The preliminary analysis of metal and ceramic finds dates the settlement into the latest phases of Middle Bronze Age and the very beginning of the Late Bronze Age or the Virovitica group. To conclude, the settlement lasted from stage Br BC until stage Br D with a few elements of Ha A. The principal economic activities were farming and livestock breeding with occasional fishery, and there are also testimonies to metallurgic activity that took place near the furnaces. At present we cannot estimate how many inhabitants the settlement had since only a small area has been excavated, but it can be assumed that it was a smaller village community...|$|R
