5|$|A {{statement}} in the House of Lords on 13 May 1959 promised further reform, and a detailed White Paper was published in December. In November 1960 a Bill <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> report {{was introduced in the}} House of Lords, where it was much scrutinised by solicitors and barristers (particularly at the Committee stage) owing to its complexity. The Bill received its royal assent on 3 August 1961, and passed into law as the Trustee Investments Act 1961.|$|E
5|$|Ali {{also sought}} to limit the {{influence}} of the al-Azhar sheikhs by allocating positions within the government to those educated outside of al-Azhar. He sent select students to France to be educated under a Western system and created an educational system <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> model that was parallel to, and thus bypassed, the system of al-Azhar.|$|E
2500|$|The bulk of Our Southern Highlanders is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> {{observations}} Kephart made {{while at}} Hazel Creek (1904–1907), although several chapters added in 1922 were <b>based</b> <b>on</b> events <b>that</b> occurred later when Kephart lived in Bryson City. [...] Chapters 9 ("The Snake-Stick Man") and 10 ("A Raid into the Sugarlands") were <b>based</b> <b>on</b> events <b>that</b> occurred in 1919.

5|$|As {{early as}} the 1909 Bogue plan, this part of Lower Queen Anne had been {{considered}} for a civic center. The Civic Auditorium (later the Opera House, now McCaw Hall), the ice arena (later Mercer Arena), and the Civic Field (rebuilt in 1946 as the High School Memorial Stadium), all built in 1927 had been placed there <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> plan, as was an armory (the Food Circus during the fair, later Center House).|$|E

5|$|In 1982, Sid Sheinberg, the {{president}} of MCA and Universal City Studios and a seasoned attorney, {{was trying to find}} a way to get his company into the booming video game market. In April, he learned of the success of Nintendo's Donkey Kong video game and sent Robert Hadl, vice president of legislative matters, to investigate. Hadl's analysis was that Donkey Kongs storyline was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of King Kong and was thus an infringement of Universal's rights to that film's characters and scenario.|$|E

5|$|Longacre's obverse of {{an eagle}} in flight is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of the Gobrecht dollar, struck in small {{quantities}} from 1836 to 1839. Although Gobrecht's model {{is not known}} with certainty, some sources state that the bird in flight was based on Peter the eagle, a tame bird fed by Mint workers in the early 1830s until it {{was caught up in}} machinery and killed. The bird was stuffed, and is still displayed at the Philadelphia Mint.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Soult {{was making}} his own plans. He knew that Blake {{intended}} to join forces with Beresford, but {{he thought that the}} Spanish divisions were still several days march away. <b>Based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> erroneous premise, Soult decided that his best course of action would be to turn the Allies' southern flank, thus driving a wedge between the two parts of Beresford's army. Soult hoped that as a result he could defeat his opponents in detail, overcoming Beresford's force and then turning south to deal with Blake's divisions.|$|E
5|$|The Jews of the Papal States, {{numbering}} 15,000 {{or so in}} 1858, were {{grateful to}} Pope Pius IX because he had ended the long-standing legal obligation for them to attend sermons in church four times a year, <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> week's Torah portion and aimed at their conversion to Christianity. He had also torn down {{the gates of the}} Roman Ghetto despite the objections of many Christians. However, Jews remained under many restrictions and the vast majority still lived in the ghetto.|$|E

5|$|The {{coat of arms}} {{appeared}} as early as 1850, but was not registered with the College of Arms until 1953. The coat of arms was registered with the Scottish equivalent of the College of Arms, the Lord Lyon King of Arms, in 1981 and with the Canadian Heraldic Authority during Queen's sesquicentennial celebrations in 1991. The coat of arms is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of the University of Edinburgh, the institution after which Queen's was modelled.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the Etna-class {{protected}} cruisers was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of Sir W G Armstrong Mitchell & Co.'s Elswick Works' earlier Giovanni Bausan, {{which was the first}} modern protected cruiser constructed for the Italian Navy. She proved successful enough that the Italians negotiated for a license to build copies in Italian shipyards. George Rendel and Carlo Vigna designed the ships. The first three ships varied somewhat in their displacement and engine power, and the last ship, Ettore Fieramosca, was slightly longer than the others.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} in 1988 by Lucasfilm employee Ron Gilbert, who designed it with Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. Gilbert's frustrations with contemporary adventure titles {{led him to}} make the player character's death almost impossible, which meant that gameplay focused the game on exploration. The atmosphere was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride. The Secret of Monkey Island was the fifth game built with the SCUMM engine, which was heavily modified to include a more user-friendly interface.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, the {{decision-making}} strategy in civil law reflects an {{allocation of risk}} of error which is equivalent between plaintiffs and respondents, between errors <b>based</b> <b>on</b> accepting <b>that</b> which should have been rejected and those <b>based</b> <b>on</b> rejecting <b>that</b> which should have been accepted. Similarly, there is equivalency between an overly stingy assessment and an overly generous assessment.|$|R

5|$|The {{ground plan}} of the St. Saviour Church in Gyumri, {{completed}} in 1873, is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of Ani Cathedral. However, the church is significantly larger than the cathedral and is not an exact replica of the latter.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{is located}} {{in front of the}} main entrance to Government House, {{one of the most prominent}} buildings in Adelaide, on the corner of North Terrace and King William Street. It was constructed with a budget of £2500 raised through public donations, and was designed by the London-based sculptor Adrian Jones. While the statue itself was not intended to represent any particular soldier, there is evidence suggesting that the head of the rider was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of George Henry Goodall.|$|E
5|$|The pose of Musidora is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of the Aphrodite of Cnidus and the Venus de' Medici. It is {{possible}} that Etty was also familiar with Thomas Gainsborough's Musidora, which shares similar elements. Gainsborough's Musidora, his only large nude, was never exhibited in his lifetime and remained in private hands until 1847, but Etty was familiar with its then-owner Robert Vernon and may have seen it in his collection.|$|E

5|$|The {{route is}} derived {{in several places}} from the {{military}} roads constructed through the Highlands by General George Wade and Major William Caulfeild in the 18th century, along with later roads constructed by Thomas Telford in the 19th. The modern route is <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> designed by Telford, but {{with a number of}} improvements primarily dating from the 1920s and 30s. These include a diversion across Rannoch Moor and another around Loch Leven, which was subsequently replaced by the Ballachulish Bridge.|$|E
5|$|Theobald Boehm did not {{directly}} invent the key system of the clarinet. Boehm was a flautist who created the key system that is now used for the transverse flute. Klosé and Buffet applied Boehm's system to the clarinet. Although the credit goes to those people, Boehm's name was given to that key system because it was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> used for flute.|$|E
5|$|A capable preacher, though {{doubtful}} of {{his ability}} when preaching to a non-academic congregation, Chadwick was well regarded as a lecturer and companion at High Table. However, a natural shyness could give him a rather remote air. On an American lecture tour, he noticed three young women who came to every lecture, but took no notes. At the end of lectures he asked the women how they had enjoyed them, {{to be told that}} they had no real interest in the subject itself, but they loved to hear him speak. The character of the college provost in the A Staircase in Surrey novels of Christ Church colleague J. I. M. Stewart was <b>based</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> of Chadwick.|$|E
