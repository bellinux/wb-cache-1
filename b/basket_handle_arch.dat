40|$|Taking arch bridges, {{including}} deck, half-through, {{and through}} arch bridges (short for DAB, HTAB, and TAB) as examples, mechanics analysis models of longitudinal interaction between continuously welded rails (short for CWRs) and arch bridges are established. Based on the {{finite element method}} (FEM), the longitudinal interaction calculation software of CWR on arch bridges has been developed. Focusing on an HTAB, the tension, compression, and deflection conditions are calculated and analyzed. The {{results show that the}} mechanics analysis models of three types of arch bridges can truly reflect the real state of the structure; the calculation software can be used for systematic research of the CWR on arch bridge; as for HTAB, temperature difference of arch rib has a small effect on rail tension/compression, and arch bridge can be simplified as a continuous beam for rail tension/compression additional force calculation; in calculation of deflection conditions of HTAB, it is suggested that train loads are arranged on half span and full span and take the direction of load entering bridge into account. Additionally, the deflection additional force variation of CFST <b>basket</b> <b>handle</b> <b>arch</b> bridge is different from that of ordinary bridge...|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to the other holy orders located in Lauzerte, the sisters of St. Clare established a school in 1623 on Rue de la Gendarmerie. Its door is {{in the shape of}} a <b>basket</b> <b>handle,</b> and the square tower to its right houses the chapel. The school attracted rich young women whose fathers encouraged them to take the veil as the dowry was less than the cost to marry them off.

5000|$|The old Longaberger {{corporate}} headquarters on State Route 16 {{is a local}} landmark and a well-known example of novelty architecture, since it takes {{the shape of the}} company's biggest seller, the [...] "Medium Market Basket". The seven-story, 180,000-square-foot building was designed by The Longaberger Company, and executed by NBBJ and Korda Nemeth Engineering. The building opened in 1997. The <b>basket</b> <b>handles</b> weigh almost 150 tons and can be heated during cold weather to prevent ice damage. Originally, Dave Longaberger wanted all of the Longaberger buildings to be shaped like baskets, but only the headquarters was completed {{at the time of his}} death.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the relationship between the structure and electronic properties of the iron center and the functions of heme proteins, both naturally occurring heme proteins and synthetically prepared heme models have been studied. The reduction potential (E°') and the pH dependence of E°' of nitrophorin 1 (NP 1) and myoglobin (Mb) were determined by spectroelectrochemical techniques. The difference in the electrostatic interaction of the Fe(III) center with buried charged groups in the heme pocket of Mb and NP 1 is the major factor that causes the 300 mV difference in E°. The pH dependence of the E°' determined between pH 5. 5 and 7. 5 is small for both Mb and NP 1 because they have the same axial ligands. Three meso-ortho-phenyl substituted porphyrins, (o-F), (o-CF₃) and (2, 6 -Cl₂) (p-OCH₃) ₃TPP and one meso-para-phenyl substituted porphyrin, (p-OCH₃) ₄TPP, were synthesized as models of cytochrome b₅. Cyclic voltammetry was used to measure their reduction potentials. The overall formation constants, logβ₂III and logβ₂II, have been calculated based on the reduction potentials of the iron(III) /(II) couple as a function of N-methylimidazole concentration. The values of logβ₂III are in the order of o-F > o-CF₃ > p-OCH₃ ≈ 2, 6 -Cl₂, indicating that the electron-donating ability is in the order of o-F < o-CF₃ < p-OCH₃ ≈ 2, 6 -Cl₂. The overlap and direct transfer of electron density from the halogen to the iron in the product reduces the Lewis acidity of iron(III), resulting in decreased logβ₂III. The order of logβ₂II for N-methylimidazole complexed Fe(II) porphyrinates {{is similar to that of}} the Fe(III) complexes, indicating no major difference in the Lewis acidity of Fe(II) as compared to Fe(III). <b>Basket</b> <b>handle</b> porphyrinates with covalently bound methionine and aliphatic amine model ligands (RCH₂SCH₃, RCH₂SCH₃ and RNH₂, RNH₂) were chosen as precusor of cytochrome c and f. The Fe(III) complexes were to be prepared and investigated by electrochemical and spectroscopic techniques. The precursor porphyrin was synthesized. Several schemes were investigated for the synthesis of the handles having methylthioether and aliphatic amine without success, and it was decided not to continue this project. Therefore, no final <b>basket</b> <b>handle</b> porphyrin was available for further characterization...|$|R

40|$|Cleanliness of {{manufactured}} {{parts and}} assemblies {{is a significant}} issue in many industries including disk drives, semiconductors, aerospace, and medical devices. Clean manufacturing requires cleanroom floor space and cleaning technology that are both expensive to own and expensive to operate. Strategies to reduce these costs are an important consideration. One strategy shown to be effective at reducing costs is to assemble parts into subassemblies and then clean the subassembly, rather than clean the individual parts first and then assemble them. One advantage is that assembly outside of the cleanroom reduces the amount of cleanroom floor space and its associated operating cost premium. A second advantage is that this strategy reduces the number of individual parts that must be cleaned prior to assembly, {{reducing the number of}} cleaning <b>baskets,</b> <b>handling</b> and, possibly, reducing the number of cleaners. The assemble then clean strategy also results in a part that is significantly cleaner because contamination generated during the assembly steps are more effectively removed that normally can be achieved by hand wiping after assembly in the cleanroom...|$|R
