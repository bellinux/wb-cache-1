5|$|Doran Martell {{receives}} news of Myrcella's {{death and}} is aghast, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Areo Hotah are immediately murdered by Ellaria Sand and Tyene Sand, while the palace guards look on without intervening. Ellaria states that his {{people have become}} dissatisfied with Doran's inaction against the Lannisters. As Doran dies, he pleads for his son's life, but Ellaria vows that weak men will never rule Dorne again.|$|E

5|$|In 1941 Kallman {{ended their}} sexual {{relationship}} {{because he could}} not accept Auden's insistence on mutual fidelity, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Auden remained companions for the rest of Auden's life, sharing houses and apartments from 1953 until Auden's death. Auden dedicated both editions of his collected poetry (1945/50 and 1966) to Isherwood and Kallman.|$|E

A detachment of the Georgia National Guard, along with county policemen {{and a group of}} Slaton's friends who were sworn in as deputies, dispersed the mob.

Sobotka himself is arrested for smuggling; he agrees to work with the detail to help his son, finally seeing his actions as a mistake. However, the Greek learns about this through his mole inside the FBI and has Sobotka killed. The {{investigation}} ends with the fourteen homicides solved but the perpetrator already dead. Several drug dealers and mid-level smuggling figures tied to the Greek are arrested, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his second-in-command escape uncharged and unidentified. The Major is pleased that Sobotka was arrested; the case is seen as a success by the commanding officers, but is viewed as a failure by the detail.|$|E
5|$|Already lightly {{regarded}} {{because he}} was selected by the Democratic Central Committee instead of a party primary, Fields further weakened his position due {{to some of his}} personal preferences. A devout Methodist and prohibitionist, Fields prohibited both dancing and drinking at the Executive Mansion. He moved the inaugural ball from the mansion to the capitol rotunda, where dancing would be allowed, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his wife did not attend. Fields' frugality also led him to keep dairy cows on the mansion's lawn, drawing derision from urban citizens.|$|E

5|$|Barbirolli's {{interest}} in new music waned in post-war years, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> the Hallé appeared regularly at the Cheltenham Festival, where he premiered new works of a mostly traditional style by William Alwyn, Richard Arnell, Arthur Benjamin, Peter Racine Fricker, Gordon Jacob, Alan Rawsthorne, Kenneth Leighton and others. For its hundredth anniversary in 1958 the Hallé commissioned several new works, including Walton's virtuosic divertimento Partita. Increasingly, Barbirolli concentrated on his core repertory {{of the standard}} symphonic classics, the works of English composers, and late-romantic music, particularly that of Mahler. In the 1960s he {{made a series of}} international tours with the Philharmonia (Latin America, 1963), BBC Symphony Orchestra (Czechoslovakia, Poland and the USSR, 1967) and the Hallé (Latin America and West Indies, 1968). It was a lasting disappointment to him that it never proved possible to take the Hallé {{on a tour of the}} United States.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the tournament}} in Poland and Ukraine, Balotelli {{was interviewed by}} a {{newspaper}} about racism amongst fans in the host countries. During the interview, Balotelli reiterated his threat to walk off the pitch {{if any of the}} opposition fans racially abused him in any way, and said that he would 'kill' anyone that threw a banana at him. He spoke about his increasing fears that black players would be targeted by racists and that he refused to accept racism in any form, talking of his past experience of racism in football notably during his time playing in Serie A for Inter Milan. During the build-up to the competition Manchester City's manager Roberto Mancini had repeatedly defended Balotelli, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> footballer Daniele De Rossi believed that Mario would need to grow up and mature {{if he was going to}} become the centrepiece of future Italian success.|$|E

5|$|In 1893 {{at the age}} of 19, Goddard {{left her}} family and went to Paris. She {{extracted}} a meager allowance from her mother, took voice lessons, and for a time sang in a cabaret, before finding out she was pregnant and delivering a baby girl on February 17, 1887. She placed the infant in a convent for care, then travelled to Rome to study art. Goddard was the only female student in her life class, as it was unusual for women to work from nude models. She encountered what would now be called sexual harassment. When a fellow student left a book open on her stool with pornographic passages underlined, she picked it up and hit him in the face with it, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his friends stalked her. She fled to Capri after he tried to force her to marry him.|$|E
5|$|Lucilla's guardian, Oliver Carleton, visits Bath to {{investigate}} her new living arrangements. Carleton is a rake– a sexually experienced man {{who refuses to}} conform to many of society's guidelines.

As Carleton and Annis's friendship develops, they discover deeper feelings for each other. Carleton proposes marriage, but Annis refuses, unwilling to relinquish her independence. Using the excuse that he must find Lucilla a new guardian, Carleton returns to London.|$|E

They return to the kingdom, its {{entrance}} now guarded by the inhabitants. Finn goes directly for the guards, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> Flame Princess are quickly captured after she reveals {{to him that the}} people are being controlled through Don John's spell.

5|$|The 509th Composite Group {{returned}} to the United States on 6 November 1945, and was stationed at Roswell Army Airfield, New Mexico. Colonel William H. Blanchard replaced Tibbets as group commander on 22 January 1946, and also became the first commander of the 509th Bombardment Wing, the successor to the 509th Composite Group. Tibbets was a technical advisor to the 1946 Operation Crossroads nuclear tests at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his Enola Gay crew were not chosen to drop another atomic bomb.|$|E

5|$|Weaver {{embarked}} on a speaking tour across the northern plains and Pacific coast states. In late August, he turned South, hoping to break the Democrats' grip on those states. As in 1880, {{the issue of race}} hurt Weaver among white Southern voters, as he sought to attract black voters by urging cooperation between white and black farmers and calling for an end to lynchings. Weaver drew good crowds in the South, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his wife were also subjected to abuse from hecklers. Southern Democrats depicted Weaver {{as a threat to the}} conservative Democrats in power there; with the increasing disenfranchisement of black voters, this was to prove fatal to the Populists' hopes in the South.|$|E
60|$|With a few broken {{words of}} {{gratitude}} the man turned, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> hesitated <b>and</b> then came back.|$|R
5000|$|Eric Chappell defended Rigsby {{by saying}} he 'was not a racist or a bigot, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> was prejudiced <b>and</b> {{suspicious}} of strangers. <b>But</b> <b>he</b> accepted Philip <b>and</b> his only concern afterwards was that he didn't get a leg over Miss Jones.' ...|$|R

During one of these, he almost attacks Amy, which Leah sees and refuses to see him.|$|E
5|$|Willkie became {{active in}} the Akron Democratic Party, {{becoming}} prominent enough while still with Firestone to introduce the Democratic presidential nominee, Ohio Governor James M. Cox, {{when he came to}} town during the 1920 campaign. He was a delegate to the 1924 Democratic National Convention, and supported New York Governor Al Smith through the record 103 ballots, when the nomination fell to former West Virginia congressman John W. Davis. More important to Willkie, though, was a fight against the Ku Klux Klan, which had become powerful in much of the nation and in the Democratic Party, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> other delegates were unsuccessful in their attempt to include a plank in the party platform condemning the Klan. He also backed a proposed plank in support of the League of Nations that ultimately failed. In 1925, Willkie led a successful effort to oust Klan members on the Akron school board.|$|E
5|$|After his victory, Basil II {{advanced}} towards Strumitsa, {{which was}} key to holding the whole Vardar valley. On {{their way to}} the city, the Byzantines seized the Matsukion fortress to the east of their advance. The Byzantine Emperor also sent an army under Botaneiates to surround Strumitsa and destroy all ramparts to the south and clear the passage to Thessalonica. With the remainder of his troops, Basil laid siege to the city itself. The Bulgarians allowed Botaneiates to destroy the fortifications, <b>but</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> his army were ambushed by Bulgarian raiders in a narrow valley, soon after their task was complete. In the ensuing battle Botaneiates was completely defeated and the Bulgarian commander Gabriel Radomir personally stabbed Botaneiates with his spear. As a result, Basil II was forced to abandon the siege of Strumitsa and retreat. On the return, the eloquence of the cubicularius Sergius convinced the defenders of Melnik to surrender, another heavy blow for the Bulgarians as the town guarded the main road to Sofia from the south.|$|E
