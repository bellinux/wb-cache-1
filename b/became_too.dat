5|$|Crompton Library is a {{purpose-built}} library housing over 36,000 items including books, CDs, and DVDs {{that can}} be borrowed by anyone {{who lives in the}} Oldham borough. It has communal Internet facilities. The library was built in the early 1990s after the original 1907 building, which exists now as apartments on Beal Lane, <b>became</b> <b>too</b> small.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, a {{freestanding}} skeleton tower {{replaced the}} light and the vacant lighthouse was soon vandalized. In 1973, the town of Greenwich acquired the lighthouse and had full-time caretakers living in the light until 2003. A caretaker continued to live in the old lighthouse until 2003, when it <b>became</b> <b>too</b> dilapidated. In 1991, it was added to the National Register of Historic Places.|$|E
5|$|It is {{now clear}} that the common {{ancestor}} of the bony fishes (Osteichthyes) had a primitive air-breathing lung—later evolved into a swim bladder in most actinopterygians (ray-finned fishes). This suggests that crossopterygians evolved in warm shallow waters, using their simple lung when the oxygen level in the water <b>became</b> <b>too</b> low.|$|E

50|$|Aluminium foil is {{produced}} by rolling sheet ingots cast from molten billet aluminium, then re-rolling on sheet and foil rolling mills to the desired thickness, or by continuously casting and cold rolling. To maintain a constant thickness in aluminium foil production, beta radiation is passed through the foil to a sensor on the other side. If the intensity <b>becomes</b> <b>too</b> high, then the rollers adjust, increasing the thickness. If the intensities <b>become</b> <b>too</b> low and the foil has <b>become</b> <b>too</b> thick, the rollers apply more pressure, causing the foil to be made thinner.|$|R

5|$|Most {{reviews of}} the {{collection}} were positive, applauding how Dalrymple had utilised his experiences to create a work that gives a transparent look at poverty in England. The main detraction that reviewers had for the collection was that Dalrymple often <b>became</b> <b>too</b> opinionated in his writing while {{he was trying to}} get across the results of his experiences.|$|E
5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred {{and placed in}} a reliquary. Tradition has it that as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it <b>became</b> <b>too</b> heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.|$|E
5|$|Once {{he signed}} with the Giants, Bonds had {{intended}} to wear 24, his number during most of his stay with the Pirates, and after receiving Mays' blessing the Giants were willing to unretire it until the public commotion from fans and media <b>became</b> <b>too</b> much. To honor his father, Bonds switched his jersey number to 25, {{as it had been}} Bobby's number in San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|The lake {{is owned}} and {{operated}} by Bristol Water, which created it in 1956 when the demand <b>became</b> <b>too</b> large for nearby Blagdon Lake. Working with the Avon Wildlife Trust, Somerset Wildlife Trust and other environmental groups, Bristol Water has encouraged various species of birds and plants, and created a venue for visitors.|$|E
5|$|Allen had {{initially}} intended to study {{to become a}} minister, but after his father <b>became</b> <b>too</b> ill to work, he instead went into teaching. He {{became a member of}} Fruitful Vale All-Age's teaching staff at age 17. Two years later, and following the death of his father, Allen went to Moneague Teachers' College to receive formal training in teaching. He became a teacher at an All-Age school in Saint Mary Parish after graduation. Between 1979 and 1983, Allen served as the principal at a succession of schools; Robins Bay All-Age School, Hillside Primary School, and finally Port Maria High School.|$|E
5|$|Although a {{comic book}} about sentient {{chickens}} could have been fantasy or science fiction, he decided {{to make it an}} outright drama. The storyline eventually <b>became</b> <b>too</b> serious for a title as silly as Ultimate Chicken Story, so he changed it to Elmer. The story was fully planned when he began work on the first issue, and he wrote it in English because he wanted an international audience.|$|E

5|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{sufficiently}} dark, Grayburn led his platoon along the ramp to the bridge, their faces blackened and their boots muffled with strips of torn up curtains. The platoon moved forward {{on either side of the}} girders along the sides of the road, but was quickly spotted by enemy forces on the bridge. Grayburn was shot in the shoulder but continued to press his men on, until the withering enemy fire <b>became</b> <b>too</b> intense and he was forced to pull them back. He was the last person to descend from the ramp into cover.|$|E
5|$|As {{the school}} roll grew, the old {{buildings}} <b>became</b> <b>too</b> small. A major building programme {{began in the}} 1950s: £128,000 was set aside to rehouse the school in purpose-built facilities adjacent to the existing school-houses. The first phase was opened in 1956 and included art and handicraft rooms; the second phase was completed in 1958 when physics and chemistry rooms were added; and the third came in 1965 {{with the opening of}} new biology and general science laboratories alongside other classrooms, while the following year saw a new hall/canteen and kitchen open. The final phase consisted of eight further rooms, built shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 Burnet {{decided to}} officially retire; in {{retirement}} he wrote two books. During this time, {{he missed his}} laboratory work, and he was constrained to social events and theorising. In 1982, Burnet {{was one of three}} contributors to Challenge to Australia, writing about genetic issues and their impact on the nation's impact. As a result {{of the success of the}} book, in early 1983, Burnet was appointed to the 70-person Australian Advisory Council of Elders to offer counsel to policymakers, but the group folded after several members <b>became</b> <b>too</b> frail or died.|$|E

5|$|Largely due to {{immigration}} from Hungary, Bohemia and Moravia, the Jewish population of Zagreb quickly grew in size: from 1,285 members in 1887 to 3,237 members in 1900, {{and then to}} 5,970 members in 1921. The synagogue <b>became</b> <b>too</b> small to accommodate {{the needs of the}} ever-growing community. In 1921 a renovation was undertaken {{to increase the number of}} available seats. A 1931 plan to increase the capacity to 944 seats was ultimately abandoned. A central heating system was installed in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Millions {{of years}} ago, creatures known as Sarnathians ruled the Earth, {{centring}} their values on torture of other creatures that {{were opposed to}} their rule. Their aim was to rule the universe using a mysterious orb that granted them great power. Thousands of years later, the orb <b>became</b> <b>too</b> powerful and eventually caused a tear in the inter-dimensional fabric of the Realm of Reality and the Realm of Unreality, thus rendering the Sarnathians extinct.|$|E
5|$|On July 21, 1961, Grissom was {{pilot of}} the second Project Mercury flight, Mercury-Redstone 4, which he named Liberty Bell 7. This was a sub-orbital flight that lasted 15 minutes and 37 seconds. After splashdown, {{emergency}} explosive bolts unexpectedly fired and blew the hatch off, causing water to flood into the spacecraft. Quickly exiting through the open hatch and into the ocean, Grissom nearly drowned as water began filling his spacesuit. A recovery helicopter tried to lift and retrieve the spacecraft, but the flooding spacecraft <b>became</b> <b>too</b> heavy, and it was ultimately cut loose before sinking.|$|E

5|$|Once the Stuka <b>became</b> <b>too</b> {{vulnerable}} to fighter opposition on all fronts, {{work was done}} to develop a replacement. None of the dedicated close-support designs {{on the drawing board}} progressed far due to the impact of the war and technological difficulties. So the Luftwaffe settled on the Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighter aircraft, with the Fw 190F becoming the ground-attack version. The Fw 190F started to replace the Ju 87 for day missions in 1943, but the Ju 87 continued {{to be used as a}} night nuisance-raider until the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|Rupert D'Oyly Carte {{refreshed}} {{the opera}} company's productions and added London seasons, beginning in 1919, {{as well as}} provincial and foreign tours. In 1948 Rupert died, leaving a strong company to his daughter Bridget D'Oyly Carte. However, the rising costs of mounting professional light opera without any government support eventually <b>became</b> <b>too</b> much for the company. Bridget was forced to close the company in 1982. Nevertheless, the Gilbert and Sullivan operas continue to be produced frequently today throughout the English-speaking world and beyond, and Carte's vision of wholesome light operas that celebrate Great Britain endures.|$|E
5|$|The capitol {{contained}} three {{rooms and}} quickly <b>became</b> <b>too</b> {{small for the}} state government, which had to erect additional office buildings across the street for the state's administration. The lower floor of the statehouse {{was used by the}} Indiana House of Representatives. The upper floor was split into two rooms, one for the Indiana State Senate and another for the Indiana Supreme Court, with a narrow hall between them. The building was abandoned as the capitol in 1824 and was given to Harrison County to use as a courthouse. The old capitol building is still preserved and is now a state historic site.|$|E
