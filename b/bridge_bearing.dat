50|$|A <b>bridge</b> <b>bearing</b> is a {{component}} of a bridge which typically provides a resting surface between bridge piers and the bridge deck. The purpose of a bearing is to allow controlled movement and thereby reduce the stresses involved. Movement could be thermal expansion or contraction, or movement from other sources such as seismic activity. There are several different types of bridge bearings which are used depending {{on a number of}} different factors including the bridge span. The oldest form of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearing</b> is simply two plates resting on top of each other. A common form of modern <b>bridge</b> <b>bearing</b> is the elastomeric <b>bridge</b> <b>bearing.</b> Another type of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearing</b> is the mechanical <b>bridge</b> <b>bearing.</b> There are several types of mechanical <b>bridge</b> <b>bearing,</b> such as the pinned bearing, which in turn includes specific types such as the rocker bearing, and the roller bearing. Another type of mechanical bearing is the fixed bearing, which allows rotation, but not other forms of movement.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{application}} of the hyperelasticity constitutive relationships for modelling of elastomeric <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings</b> is presented. Elastomers which are used for <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings</b> are nearly incompressible materials. Consequently, two models of hyperelasticity for rubber-like materials, i. e. neo-Hookean and Yeoh models are considered. The neo-Hookean model is the simplest possible model of hyperelasticity but unfortunately it {{has a number of}} disadvantages (i. e. at certain deformation modes it gives physically unreasonable predictions). The Yeoh model for nonlinear elastic materials is superior to neo-Hookean model and leads to rational description of the behavior of the elastomers for significant elongations and is implemented in many commercial programs using finite element method (FEM). In this work, ABAQUS program is utilized for modelling of chosen <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings.</b> The parameters of two constitutive models are determined based on experimental results and are used in numerical calculations for selected examples of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings.</b> Concluding remarks are drawn and directions of future research are outlined...|$|R

40|$|A {{technical}} {{solution to the}} problem of unavoidable movements in bridge structures is the use of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>Bridge</b> <b>bearings</b> are small integral parts of the entire bridge structure serving several purposes, such as connection, transfer of forces, allowing movements, force damping etc. However, <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings</b> could create more problems for the bridge structure than it solves if not properly understood, especially when it receives less attention than it deserves. Technical and practical issues, such as selection of the right bearing type for use, merits and demerits of different bearing types, maintenance and monitoring, replacement, life cycle cost etc. are all imperative to ensure that bearings satisfy their purpose.   This study takes into consideration the practical and theoretical experience available for the use of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings.</b> Two electronic surveys were used to garner knowledge and expertise from <b>bridge</b> engineers, <b>bearing</b> manufacturers and other stake holders in the course of this study, also practical knowledge concerning various types and problems of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings,</b> maintenance, repair and replacement, life cycle costing etc. were employed in addition to physical investigation of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings</b> in the Stockholm area of Sweden.   Generally, all bearing types were found to perform their functions satisfactorily when in good conditions, though inevitable problem of degradation reduces the life span of these bearings, especially the ones made mainly of steel being affected by corrosion. Those made of rubber components also degrade and perform poorly in low temperatures and under high load magnitude, though they are the most economical solution to many problems, especially in seismically active areas. Modern and enclosed bearing types such as pot, spherical, disc, LRB, FPB etc. are best used in critical conditions like high vertical load, extensive degree/extent of movement, seismic areas etc. but they are expensive solutions due to technicality in construction, and they are not exempted from various problems of degradation...|$|R

In order to give a critical opinion about the tests, it is necessary to obtain more knowledge about the variable load and movement history of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings</b> of a concrete bridge, the ‘Dintelhavenbrug’. The load and movement history of <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings</b> of the ‘Dintelhavenbrug’ are analyzed by means of a finite element model. In this model the loads caused by traffic en temperature are considered. The traffic loads follow from a fatigue load model with 12 types of trucks, based on the European Standard for traffic loads (NEN-EN 1991 - 2) and measurements of traffic on the bridge near ‘Moerdijk’. The temperature loads follow from the European Standards (NEN-EN 1991 - 1 - 5). For both types of (static) loadings the forces, displacements, rotations and slide paths, which occurs during the lifetime of the different <b>bridge</b> <b>bearings,</b> are determined for each bearing.
