The clusters are obtained by Bregman co-clustering applied offline on a subset of training data. Therefore, being aware of the semantic context of the input image, our features have higher discriminative power than do those pooled from appearance-based partitioning. Testing on four datasets (Caltech- 101, Caltech- 256, 15 Scenes, and 17 Flowers) belonging to three different classification tasks showed that the proposed method outperforms methods in previous works on local pooling in the feature space for less feature dimensionality. Moreover, when implemented within a spatial pyramid, our method achieves comparable results on three of the datasets used...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} two new online bin packing problems, {{the online}} Variable Cost and Size Bin Packing Problem (o-VCSBPP) and the online Generalized Bin Packing Problem (o-GBPP). We take two well-known bin packing algorithms to address them, the First Fit (FF) and the Best Fit (BF). We show that both algorithms have an asymptotic worst-case ratio bound equal to 2 for the o-VCSBPP and this bound is tight. When {{there are enough}} bins of a particular type to load all items, FF and BF also have an absolute worst-case ratio bound equal to 2 for the o-VCSBPP, and this bound is also tight.

Therefore, we consider a natural evolution of these algorithms, the First Fit with Rejection and the Best Fit with Rejection, able to reject inconvenient <b>bins</b> at the <b>end</b> of the process. Similarly, we prove that no worst-case ratio of these algorithms can be computed for the o-GBPP.

40|$|Four Zebu bulls {{of about}} 200 kg liveweight {{and two years}} of age were {{used to measure the}} {{digestibility}} of cassava forage (leaves, petiole and green stem). One animal selected leaves and petiole, while the other three ate the entire forage. The average digestibility (mean of three ± SEx) was 66. 5 ± 0. 6 % with a Consumption Index of 2. 00 ± 0. 16 kg/ 100 kg liveweight. These values compare favourably with measurements made with sweet potato and banana forage. Key Words: Cattle, cassava forage, digestibility, intake A number of experiments have recently been carried out using the aerial part of cassava as a component of the diet to supply fibre and protein (Meyreles et al 1977 a; Meyreles et al 1977 b; Meyreles et al 1977 c; Fernandez et al 1977; Fernandez et al 1978). It has generally been found that small additions of cassava forage to cane diets have been associated with only slight improvement in animal performance. However, when given as a forage source in molasses based diets, the rate of animal liveweight gain has been high. It is therefore important to know the apparent digestibility of the forage alone {{in order to have a}} better understanding of the way it functions as a dietary component. Materials and Methods Animals, Treatments and Design: Four Zebu bulls of approximately 200 kg were given chopped cassava forage (green stem, petiole and leaves). All four animals were on experiment at the same time. Procedure: The animals were given the chopped cassava forage for one week before being put into digestibility crates for a second week. A total collection of faeces was made during the last six days of this second week. Food consumption was recorded daily, faeces were bulked in a plastic <b>bin</b> until the <b>end</b> of the collection period when they were weighed, mixed and dry matter determined.

40|$|Robotic {{exploration}} of Mars {{has been a}} "one shot" approach where each surface mission is planned typically with a rover that will perform a series of experiments {{for a few weeks}} or months, until the robot becomes unable to operate in the harsh Mars conditions and simply "dies". It would clearly be desirable to have robots on Mars that can last for much longer periods of time, I propose that there is an approach to sustained robotic exploration that can also pave the way to future human presence. The idea is to continue building a robotic infrastructure with every mission we send. The approach is to built a team of modular robots that could repair individual members when they break down. We could "seed" areas of interest with sturdy power stations (solar, chemical) that teams of robots could use to recharge themselves. We could also seed parts and modules the robots could access for self-repair. No mission could really "fail" if we simply keep adding to and maintaining the existing infrastructure. Simply landing a package of parts will be a success. In time we create a loose infrastructure that can be controlled and augmented from earth on a continuing basis, and which could eventually pave the way for human exploration. I propose that we could begin to build this infrastructure from relatively simple modular robots. Imagine 2 "spider-like" robots built out of small modular snap-in pieces, a bin of these pieces and a <b>bin</b> of snap-in <b>end</b> effectors. One of the spiders breaks down, i. e. one of its modules needs to be replaced. The second spider comes to the rescue and helps the first one replace the broken module. Assuming the input of fresh modules, this process can continue indefinetly. Now start separating robotic explorers from robotic "mechanics", start adding, a category of mechanics that are able to fix {{at least some of the}} broken modules (and which in turn can be fixed by the original mechanics), The need for a fresh influx of modules is thus reduced. I submit that we could bootstrap a robotic ecology until it needs very little material from earth and can rely mostly on in-situ resources., We can experiment with this concept in an earthbound facility that can also simulate Mars conditions. I propose that we call this facility Robosphere 1...|$|R

Al finalizar la desverdización los frutos se almacenaron a 7 º C (limones) y 5 º C (naranjas) y humedad relativa cercana al 90 % por 21 días. Se realizaron evaluaciones en el color verde, amarillo y anaranjado utilizando el índice de color (IC), tonalidad Hab, incremento de color (DC) y color de fondo. También se analizó deshidratación, jugosidad, acidez (AT), sólidos {{solubles}} (% SS), relación SS/AT y abscisión de cáliz. Los períodos de evaluación fueron: a la salida de la cámara de desverdizado, 7, 14 y 21 días de almacenaje refrigerado. Los parámetros de calidad como acidez, sólidos solubles, jugosidad e índice de madurez no sufrieron cambios significativos en ninguna de las especies. No se produjeron pérdidas significativas por ataques fúngicos, ni por desórdenes fisiológicos. Las pérdidas por deshidratación no superaron el 0, 6 % finalizada la desverdización. No se produjeron pérdidas significativas por deshidratación durante el almacenaje. En limones se produjeron diferencias significativas en el color verde y amarillo a los 7 días de almacenaje. Los índices tonalidad Hab e incremento de color reflejaron dicha diferencia.

Of course the old man put my back up, and of course he put up the crew's, and I had to regular fight my way through every watch. The men got to hate me, so's I would hear them grit their teeth when I came up. At last one day I saw a big hulking beast of a Dutchman booting the ship's boy. I made one shoot of it off the house and laid that Dutchman out. Up he came, and I laid him out again. 'Now,' I said, 'if there's a kick left in you, just mention it, and I'll stamp your ribs in like a packing-case.' He thought better of it, and never let on; lay there as mild as a deacon at a funeral, and they took him below to reflect on his native Dutchland. One night we got caught in rather a dirty thing about 25 south. I guess we were all asleep, for the first thing I knew there was the fore-royal gone. I ran forward, bawling blue hell; and just as I came by the foremast something struck me right through the fore-arm and stuck there. I put my other hand up, and, by George, it was the grain; the beasts had speared me like a porpoise. 'Cap'n!' I cried. 'What's wrong?' says he. 'They've grained me,' says I. 'Grained you?' says he. 'Well, I've been looking for that.' 'And by God,' I cried, 'I want to have some of these beasts murdered for it!' 'Now, Mr. Nares,' says he, 'you better go below. If I had been one of the men, you'd have got more than this. And I want no more of your language on deck. You've cost me my fore-royal already,' says he; 'and if you carry on, you'll have the three sticks out of her.' That was old man Green's idea of supporting officers. But you wait a bit; the cream's coming. We made Melbourne right enough, and the old man said: 'Mr. Nares, you and me don't draw together. You're a first-rate seaman, no mistake of that; but you're the most disagreeable man I ever sailed with, and your language and your conduct to the crew I cannot stomach. I guess we'll separate.' I didn't care about the berth, you may be sure; but I felt kind of mean, and if he made one kind of stink I thought I could make another. So I said I would go ashore and see how things stood; went, found I was all right, and came aboard again on the top rail. 'Are you getting your traps together, Mr. Nares?' says the old man. 'No,' says I, 'I don't know as we'll separate much before 'Frisco--at least,' I said, 'it's a point for your consideration. I'm very willing to say good-bye to the Maria, but I don't know whether you'll care to start me out with three months' wages.' He got his money-box right away. 'My son,' says he, 'I think it cheap at the money.' He had me there." ...|$|R
40|$|Methods of {{evaluating}} the techniques and equipment used for direct drilling of seeds into untilled soils were reviewed and developed. Field tests {{were used to}} highlight seedling establishment problems and were complimented by a tillage bin technique which sought to isolate variables such as climate, soil type and soil moisture regime. The tillage bin technique involved collecting half-tonne undisturbed blocks of turf in open <b>ended</b> steel <b>bins</b> using a special turf cutting machine. These tillage bins were subjected to a common climate and moisture supply by placing them beneath transparent rain canopies and applying water artificially. Drilling utilized a support bed on which several <b>bins</b> were placed <b>end</b> to end and which was straddled by a moving gantry and tool testing apparatus operating on rails alongside. This facility allowed close visual appraisal {{to be made of}} the action of coulters and seed deposition and was operated at speeds which were infinitely variable, within limits. Seed metering was precisely controlled and selected coulter forces and soil physical properties were measured with the apparatus. Turf blocks, in their tillage bins, were returned to the rain protection canopies after drilling for plant response studies. Soil cover over the seed appeared to be important in promoting seedling emergence. Field covering devices were evaluated and a bar harrow was developed and adopted as a standard covering procedure. The importance of covering the seed appeared to be more pronounced with large seeds such as maize and barley than with smaller seeds such as lucerne. A strong relationship between visual scoring of the amount and type of cover, and seedling emergence data was established. This favoured covering media with a predominance of unbroken dead pasture mulch, compared with loose soil and rubble. The performances of a range of drill coulters operating at slow speeds in association with the bar harrow, were compared in terms of plant responses under soil moisture stress. An experimental chisel coulter was developed to obviate the noted shortcomings of some of these existing coulters. In contrast to the "V" shaped grooves left by most coulters, the chisel confined most of its soil disturbance to sub surface layers, with a narrow opening at the surface. With all coulters, seed germination appeared to be less affected by coulter design than seedling emergence because of sub surface mortality of seedlings. In this respect clear seedling emergence responses favoured the chisel coulter. Maximum wheat seedling emergence with the chisel coulter assembly was 77 %, which was significantly greater than hoe and triple disc coulters with 27 % and 26 % respectively. As the initial soil moisture level was raised in other experiments the magnitude of these differences decreased but the order of ranking remained. A 22 % comparative decrease in initial soil moisture content was necessary to reduce the performance of the chisel coulter to a similar level to that of the hoe and triple disc coulters. Difficulty was experienced in accurately monitoring in-groove soil moisture regimes, but irrigation responses and gravimetric determinations of sub samples suggested that the ability of grooves to retain available soil moisture was a critical factor in the plant emergence responses. Soil temperatures appeared not to be greatly affected by coulter type in these experiments although the in-groove minimum temperature with the chisel coulter was significantly higher than the hoe and triple disc coulters in one experiment. Observation of the modes of action of coulters showed that the chisel and hoe coulters produced some upward soil heaving while the triple disc appeared to operate with a downward and outward wedging action in the soil. An increase in soil density under the groove resulted from passage of the triple disc coulter but no effect on density was seen with the chisel or hoe coulters. The down forces required for 38 mm penetration of all coulters tested, appeared also to be closely related to their modes of action and relatively insensitive to soil moisture content in the stress range. In this respect the triple disc required 1. 4 times more force than the dished disc coulter and from 2. 3 to 4. 6 times more force than a range of 4 other coulters. Field tests of the wear rates of chisel coulters constructed of various steel based materials, with and without hardening treatments, suggested a number of preferred treatments but could not establish any difference in wear rate from coulters operating in the tractor wheel marks compared with those operating in unmarked soil...|$|R
40|$|This PhD thesis {{deals with}} {{results from the}} Large Hadron Collider (LHC), which {{provided}} first data in September 2009. Intrinsically it was foreseen that first collisions should already occur end of 2008. On September the 10 th the first beam event was partially successful, but {{after a week of}} running an accident in the sectors 3 and 4 spoiled some of the magnets of the synchrotron. This caused a delay of almost one year due to the necessary repairs. After repairing and some further test for the purpose of calibration and alignment of the subsystems with cosmic rays on the 23 rd of November and ultimately with stable beam on the 6 / 7 th of December 2009 collisions of protons (p+p) at an energy of √sNN = 900 GeV took place. After an intended winter stop the first long run of the LHC commenced on the 30 th of March 2010. Like in the previous years protons with an increased world record energy of 7 TeV were brought to collision. After 7 month of continuous data taking in p+p the last month of running was dedicated to lead collisions (Pb+Pb) at 2. 76 TeV per nucleon. This will be the foreseen program for the next years of data taking with the LHC. On the long run the energy will be increased to 14 TeV in p+p and 5. 5 TeV per nucleon in Pb+Pb. A Large Ion Collider Experiment (ALICE) is one of the four major detectors at the LHC and the only one dedicated to heavy ion physics. It is divided into 13 subsystems. One of these is the ALICE Transition Radiation Detector (TRD), which is installed around the Time Projection Chamber (TPC) at a distance of 3 m to the beam pipe. The acceptance in ϕ covers the complete 360 ◦. The coverage of the TRD in pseudorapidity is ± 0. 84, comparable to an angle of 45 °. This subsystems concept is intentionally modular, being composed of 18 supermoduls, each containing 30 chambers. Always 6 such small units in a row (in r direction) are called a stack. Altogether the TRD is made up of 522 chambers, each of them being able to work as a self-sustaining small Transition Radiation Detector. Because of the limited precision while the integration of the supermoduls into the ALICE detector, they are shifted in average by 10 mm with reference to their ideal dedicated position. Furthermore the chambers are misaligned up to 1 mm relative to their stack. This imprecise installation together with time dependant changes of the real positions relative to the ideal geometry leads to a loss in detector efficiency and resolution. Some tracks are badly reconstructed concerning true trajectory others are even not found. Aim of the alignment of the TRD is the minimization of the above described geometrical uncertainties while the conversion of the detector signals into digital position informations, the so called reconstruction. This leads to a better tracking efficiency and resolution in the TRD. For this purpose the AliROOT alignment framework was developed. In the first step, the tracks which can come from cosmic rays or collisions in the LHC are examined concerning there usefulness for the alignment. Some cuts are applied. With the tracks which pass these cuts it is possible to calculate the necessary corrections of the positions for the supermoduls and chambers of the TRD. The supermoduls are aligned relative to the TPC which is suggested to be in an ideal position and the chambers are positioned concerning the remaining 5 chambers of their stack. As a result one receives six correction parameters (alignment parameters) for each alignable module of the TRD (supermoduls and chambers) in the chosen reference frame. These parameters are the three shifts along the axis in the local frame - z shift, rϕ-shift and r-shift, as well as the three rotations or tilts around these axis - z-tilt, ϕ-tilt and r-tilt. The extracted correction parameters are stored in the of Offline Condition Data Base (OCDB) and used when doing a new reconstruction cycle. In the end the efficiency and resolution of the TRD are monitored. The final position uncertainty of the supermoduls concerning the TPC was below 1000 μm. The position uncertainty of the chambers within their stacks appears to be around 300 μm. This is below the resolution (tracks relative to tracklets) of the TRD which reveals values higher than 400 μm. The second part of this thesis deals with two particle intensity interferometry. HBT, named after Robert Hanbury Brown (1916 - 2002) and Richard Twiss (1920 - 2005), reveals one possible way of gaining access to the space time evolution of the particle emitting source in p+p as well as in heavy ion collisions. The data of ALICE where analysed with this method, which first ideas trace back to the fifties of the last century. The systems for intensity interferometry of identical pions (π+π+ und π−π−) which we analysed were p+p at √sNN = 900 GeV as well as 7 TeV, and heavy ion collisions in Pb+Pb at √sNN= 2. 76 TeV per nucleon. The first data we looked at were identical 900 GeV p+p pions [Aamodt, K. et al., 2010 b]. This data set was collected in December 2009 as well as in April 2010. The one dimensional HBT radius obtained was 0. 83 ± 0. 05 (sys.) ± 0. 07 (stat.) fm. It was remarkable that, like in preceding experiments in small systems, one was not able to fit the correlation function with a simple gaussian form (like in heavy ion systems). An exponential function was used to gain acceptable results. Furthermore we saw long range correlations at higher invariant pair momenta. A scaling behaviour with KT could not be verified by implication. Looking at the three dimensional parametrization one gets the HBT radii Rout = 0. 79 ± 0. 09 (sys.) ± 0. 05 (stat.) fm, Rside = 0. 62 ± 0. 08 (sys.) ± 0. 06 (stat.) fm as well as Rlong = 1. 24 ± 0. 07 (sys.) ± 0. 10 (stat.). Their dependency on the event multiplicity dNch/dη was obvious, whereas the scaling with the pair momentum kT was not as strong as in prior studies. In addition this dependency of the HBT radii on the pair momenta depends on the subtraction of the nonfemtoscopic background. The world record 7 TeV p+p data of the LHC were analysed the same way. In the Centre of Mass System (CMS) the invariant one dimensional HBT radius was RInv = 1. 02 ± 0. 04 (sys.) ± 0. 04 (stat.) fm. The results of a three dimensional treatment of the data were Rout = 0. 82 ± 0. 04 (sys.) ± 0. 01 (stat.) fm, Rside = 0. 75 ± 0. 03 (sys.) ± 0. 02 (stat.) fm and Rlong = 1. 41 ± 0. 05 (sys.) ± 0. 04 (stat.) fm. Like in the 900 GeV data a pronounced dependency of the radii on the event multiplicity was discoverable. Another very interesting result that appeared was that the transverse dimensions of the pion emitting region do not significantly differ in the two observed energies (looking at equal multiplicity <b>bins).</b> In the <b>end</b> with the 7 TeV data it was possible to establish a link in multiplicity between proton collisions and peripheral heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies [Aamodt, K. et al., 2011 d]...|$|R
