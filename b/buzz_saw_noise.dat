40|$|A {{supersonic}} {{tip speed}} {{single stage fan}} was modified {{with the intent of}} reducing multiple pure tone (MPT) or <b>buzz</b> <b>saw</b> <b>noise.</b> There were three modifications to the blades from the original design. The modifications to the blade resulted in an increase in cascade throat area causing the shock to start at a lower corrected fan speed. The acoustic results without acoustically absorbing liners showed substantial reduction in multiple pure tone levels. However, an increase in the blade passing frequency noise at takeoff fan speed accompanied the MPT reduction. The net result however, was a reduction in the maximum 1000 -foot (304. 8 m) altitude level flyover PNL. For the case with acoustic treatment in the inlet outer wall, the takeoff noise increased relative to an acoustically treated baseline. This was largely due to the increased blade passing frequency noise which was not effectively reduced by the liner...|$|E
40|$|International audienceSeveral {{approaches}} of N-wave generation and propagation {{have been studied}} during the past forty years, but most advanced semi-analytical models still consider geometrical simplifications. In this paper numerical simulations based on the Euler solver of a CFD code dedicated to the capture of shocks generated by turbofans in transonic conditions are investigated. The main objective is {{to take into account}} actual inlet geometry and realistic convection flow associated with nonlinear propagation. Regular and non-regular shock waves are directly injected in a plane close to the fan and propagated through the inlet. The initial shock description near the fan is provided either by a steady RANS computation or by experiment, or else from an analytical modeling. Unsteady Euler calculations on suited acoustic grids are favorably compared to analytical solutions on simplified (quasi- 2 D) cases, and significant 3 D effects are highlighted on realistic configurations. First application to a Snecma turbofan demonstrator using both test bed measurements and RANS solution as input data show that the present numerical approach is able to accurately assess the <b>buzz</b> <b>saw</b> <b>noise</b> spectrum measured in the intake...|$|E
50|$|The emblem {{selected}} for Active International was the <b>buzz</b> <b>saw.</b> The <b>buzz</b> <b>saw</b> {{is just about}} the most active object you can find anywhere. Even when motionless, as it is on the emblem, it has the appearance of intense activity. Since Aberdeen was a lumber center and sawmills with humming saw blades were in evidence everywhere, it was only logical that the founders of Active chose the <b>buzz</b> <b>saw</b> for their emblem. The <b>buzz</b> <b>saw</b> represents the usefulness of intense activity and the abundant energy of responsible youth, means power, strength, and progress.|$|R

5|$|BuzzSaw is themed {{around a}} series of unexplainable occurrences in the Town of Gold Rush which {{date back to the}} late 1800s. In 1876, the Town of Gold Rush was formed. It was a prosperous town during the great gold rush. Eleven years later, in 1887, the town's Gold supply was {{completely}} gone. The town then established a sawmill and turned their focus to timber. On a clear moon-lit night, a sawmill worker named Jack Darke was killed by the <b>buzz</b> <b>saw</b> after he had a scuffle with some other workers who were attempting to set the building on fire. The circumstances leading up to his death were covered up by the town with the legend stating that Jack tried to burn down the sawmill and slipped into the path of the <b>buzz</b> <b>saw.</b> The sawmill has remained closed since with many people claiming encounters with the ghost of Jack on nights similar to that of his death.|$|R
5000|$|Oswald {{comes to}} the house, and peeps through a window. Inside he sees a large {{turbulent}} dog interrogating a small living doll about the money's location.

And when the lynx also refuses, the dog ties the doll onto a lumber which is then placed to be sliced by a <b>buzz</b> <b>saw.</b> The lynx finally gives in, and the dog immediately finds a sack of cash hidden within that feline. The lynx then asks the dog to release the doll but the dog just thinks it would be pleasant to have her halved as the canine flees. Oswald returns to {{the house with a}} group of cops but the dog has already gone. Instead, the rabbit stops the <b>buzz</b> <b>saw</b> and unties the doll.|$|R
