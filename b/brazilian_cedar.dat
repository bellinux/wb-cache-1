5000|$|The {{substitution}} of forested trees such as Guanandi {{in place of}} irregular, illegal cutting of Amazon trees is proven to be very positive to preserve these important biomes; Guanandi, unlike Mahogany, occurs in pure stands so to cut and transport a single Mahogany in the Amazon requires destroying 30 other trees. This substitution is possible because Europeans, Japanese and Americans conscientious buyers are beginning to understand the importance in conservation of the Amazon Forest so they tend to accept paying more for reforested wood. Other important trees specimens, in opposite from Guanandi, can not be harvested because they are attacked by Hypsipyla grandella, Zeller. This caterpillar destroys the main structure of this trees: Genuine South American Mahogany (Swetenia macrophila), <b>Brazilian</b> <b>Cedar</b> (Cedrela fissilis) and Crabwood (Carapa Guianensis) ...|$|E

The former dense forests {{consisted}} mostly in <b>Brazilian</b> walnuts, <b>Cedars,</b> Cinnamons, Yerba mat√©, and the exuberant Brazilian Pines. These forests still represent the typical Southern Brazilian landscape in spite of ruthless deforestation in the past decades. A significant turnover in the economy took place due to the shortage of wood, implementation of Brazilian environmental laws and environmental consciousness. As a result, agriculture became the predominant source of wealth alongside the production of paper, cellulose, and furniture derived from extensive reforestation areas. The reforestation projects introduced the Pinus elliottii to the region.|$|R
