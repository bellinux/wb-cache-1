In 1919 Smuggler Mine, the city's largest and oldest, shut down most of its operations and several others closed. The second Midland again succumbed to bankruptcy; there was no second resurrection. Its tracks and right-of-way, including the bridges, were abandoned.|$|E

25|$|With {{losses to}} the Spanish navy increasing, and the {{eventual}} fall in profits from slave selling, raiding became less {{appealing to the}} Iranuns and their Islamic supporters. Uneconomical patriotism simply did not make quite an appeal. Thus, it came to pass that the Moro pirates faded from Mindoro's history. The pirate fort in Mamburao was abandoned, and the Moros retreated to Mindanao to consolidate their forces and continue the Moslem resistance at the homefront. Mindoro Island then became a Spanish possession in a truer sense for the first time. <b>But</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
25|$|The match went to extra time, and France {{finished}} slightly {{the stronger}} {{of the two}} sides. No more goals were scored, {{and so it was}} time for a penalty shoot-out. Socrates, who had earlier missed an open goal and headed an easy chance straight into the French keeper's arms, failed with the first kick for Brazil. The next six penalties were all converted, and then Platini fired over the bar. Brazil were back on level terms – <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b> Julio Cesar struck the post with his penalty, and Luis Fernández then scored to put France through 4–3 on penalties.|$|E

500|$|Delta Sigma Theta is an {{historically}} African-American sorority at Dartmouth College {{that was}} founded in 1982 as the Che-Ase Interest Group. [...] At the time, the college had imposed a moratorium on the founding on new sororities, but when the moratorium was lifted, the group was recognized by the college as a sorority {{in the fall of}} 1984. [...] The women contacted the Delta Sigma Theta national sorority and were granted a charter as the Pi Theta chapter in the spring of 1985. [...] Delta Sigma Theta provided an extensive array of public service through the Five-Point Thrust program. [...] Until the chapter's dissolution, the sisters of Delta Sigma Theta had cosponsored the Step Show, an annual cultural dance performance, with the brothers of Alpha Phi Alpha.

The following year, Enema of the State, the first major-label release by pop punk band Blink-182, reached the top ten and sold four million copies in under twelve months. In January 2000, the album's second single, [...] "All the Small Things", hit the sixth spot on the Billboard Hot 100. While they were viewed as Green Day [...] "acolytes", critics also found teen pop acts such as Britney Spears, the Backstreet Boys, and 'N Sync suitable points of comparison for Blink-182's sound and market niche. The band's Take Off Your Pants and Jacket (2001) and Blink-182 (2003) respectively rose to numbers one and three on the album chart. In November 2003, The New Yorker described how the [...] "giddily puerile" [...] act had [...] "become massively popular with the mainstream audience, a demographic formerly considered untouchable by punk-rock purists." ...|$|E

2500|$|The quarter-final {{opponent}} was one Lithuania {{could not}} defeat in previous years, Yugoslavia. The start was anxious as Lithuanians were trailing 8–2, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long.</b> Yugoslavians resisted only until three minutes were left, with Lithuania already leading the game 72–58. Then nobody doubted – the quarter-final winner is Lithuania, officially winning the game 76–63. Head coach Jonas Kazlauskas: [...] "Winning against the Yugoslavian team and its coach is every team and every coach dream. We {{are even more}} happy that we won in the quarter-final. The gulf is separating the quarter-final winner teams from the losers. We played very orderly, probably the most disciplined in this tournament. We defended well. Furthermore, Gintaras Einikis and Šarūnas Jasikevičius played amazingly". Lithuania was to compete for another Olympic medal, to the happiness of all their fans.|$|E

This order was carried out, <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long,</b> because further orders were soon forthcoming with instructions to bypass San Francisco and report to the Thirteenth Naval District, Seattle, Washington. The arrival at Seattle was heralded by a shore-based ovation. Following the debarkation of the passengers, the ship was brought over to the Bremerton Navy Yard for repairs. The yard workers concentrated mostly on the boilers, which were in serious need of attention. Temporary repairs took one week after which the headquarters detachment of the 97th Infantry Division was embarked at Pier Forty-two.|$|E

2500|$|Far-field or {{radiative}} region – Beyond about 1 wavelength (λ) of the antenna, {{the electric}} and magnetic fields are perpendicular {{to each other}} and propagate as an electromagnetic wave; examples are radio waves, microwaves, or light waves. [...] This part of the energy is radiative, meaning it leaves the antenna {{whether or not there is}} a receiver to absorb it. [...] The portion of energy which does not strike the receiving antenna is dissipated and lost to the system. The amount of power emitted as electromagnetic waves by an antenna depends on the ratio of the antenna's size Dant to the wavelength of the waves λ, which is determined by the frequency: λ=c/f. [...] At low frequencies f where the antenna is much smaller than the size of the waves, Dant<<nbsp&λ, very little power is radiated. [...] Therefore the near-field devices above, which use lower frequencies, radiate almost none of their energy as electromagnetic radiation. [...] Antennas about the same size as the wavelength [...] Dantnbsp&≈nbsp&λ [...] such as monopole or dipole antennas, [...] radiate power efficiently, but the electromagnetic waves are radiated in all directions (omnidirectionally), so if the receiving antenna is far away, only a small amount of the radiation will hit it. [...] Therefore, these can be used for short range, inefficient power transmission <b>but</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>long</b> range transmission.|$|E
