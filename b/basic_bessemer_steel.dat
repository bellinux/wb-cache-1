2500|$|In {{the last}} three decades of the 19th century iron and steel became a leading industry, in second place by value added, with {{machinery}} being in first place. [...] The Bessemer process was the first large scale process for producing steel, which it was able to do at low cost. [...] The first U.S. licensed Bessemer plant began operation in 1865. <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was used mostly for rails. [...] Due to difficulty in controlling quality and embrittlement with aging, <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was not suitable for structural purposes.|$|R
50|$|In 1864, <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> {{was first}} {{made in the}} United States, and the association, {{headquartered}} in Philadelphia {{changed its name to}} the American Iron and Steel Association (AISA).|$|R
40|$|Contrasting {{the iron}} {{law of the}} {{principle}} of comparative advantages as the determinant of the international division of labour has attracted dissidents to the international trade paradigm over the years. Spanish <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> is an outstanding comparative advantage enigma which stands to be resolved. Spain possessed important reserves apt for ore specific Bessemer processing. Depletion of existing deposits in industrial Europe and the increasing demand for this resource endowment made this all the more relevant. This paper examines if Spain could have or should have become one of Europe’s major producers of <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel.</b> ...|$|R

50|$|Richards {{worked as}} assistant, and chief {{engineer}} of the Tredegar Iron Works. By 1871 he was {{general manager of}} the Ebbw Vale Iron Works, where he planned the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>Steel</b> Department.|$|R
50|$|In 1857 Mr. Griswold {{became a}} large {{owner of the}} iron mills of Troy having been granted the US <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> process patents {{important}} for expanding the Rensselaer Iron and Steel Works business.|$|R
50|$|To {{make the}} steel legally {{it was decided}} to acquire the Bessemer patent rights. Zoheth S. Durfee went to England to acquire the patent rights to the Bessemer process. He was {{unsuccessful}} at this but did observe several European steelmakers and managed to get the rights to Englishman Robert Mushet's patent use of spiegeleisen (manganese-rich pig iron) for better overall quality of steel produced this way. Meanwhile, William F. Durfee (engineer and architect), Robert Mushet, Thomas Clare and John Brown were brought in by Ward to make the procedure necessary to produce <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel,</b> especially using spiegeleisen. He succeeded in making <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> at the experimental works of the Kelly Pneumatic Process Company owned by Ward and his investors. The first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> made in the United States was at this factory in 1865. In Henry Bessemer's autobiography he writes that the Bessemer process was first experimentally practised in the United States with a 3-ton converter, at the ironworks of Mr. E. B. Ward, at Wyandotte, near Detroit.|$|R
50|$|During 1874, {{the city}} had several steel and iron {{foundries}} in operation including; Porter & Luther, Draper's Iron Works, Alexander, Bradley & Dunning, Phoenix Foundry, Delano Iron Works, <b>Bessemer</b> <b>Steel</b> Works and the Blast Furnace in Geddes.|$|R
5000|$|Carnegie's great {{innovation}} was in {{the cheap}} and efficient mass production of steel rails for railroad lines. This could not have happened without the prior invention of <b>Bessemer</b> <b>Steel.</b> Thus Carnegie's [...] "innovation" [...] was scale, not anything technical.|$|R
50|$|Fuller's firm {{built the}} Tacoma Building in Chicago {{designed}} by Holabird & Roche and completed in 1889, {{which was the}} first skyscraper with non load bearing curtain walls. By using <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> beams, Fuller created steel cages that supported all the building's weight.|$|R
50|$|Returning to {{civilian}} life, in July 1865 {{he went to}} work for the Cambria Co. and was named superintendent of the experimental <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> works in Wyandotte, Michigan. This was the first <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> plant to be operated in the United States. He remained in charge of the Wyandotte Bessemer Works until 1866, when he returned to Johnstown where the Cambria Co. was erecting a Bessemer plant. Since the construction of this factory was not completed until July 1871, Cambria placed Hunt in charge of the process of rolling steel ingots into rail tracks for use by the Pennsylvania Railroad. Once the Cambria Bessemer plant was put into operation, Hunt, along with John E. Fry and Alexander L. Holley introduced a new bottom casting method for which the three received a patent.|$|R
5000|$|To supply {{small scale}} power that was {{impractical}} for individual steam engines, central station hydraulic systems were developed. Hydraulic power {{was used to}} operate cranes and other machinery in British ports and elsewhere in Europe. The largest hydraulic system was in London. Hydraulic power was used extensively in <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> production ...|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Bessemer</b> process {{revolutionized}} <b>steel</b> manufacture by decreasing its cost, from £40 per {{long ton}} to £6-7 per long ton, along with greatly increasing {{the scale and}} speed of production of this vital raw material. The process also decreased the labor requirements for steel-making. Before it was introduced, steel was far too expensive to make bridges or the framework for buildings and thus wrought iron had been used throughout the Industrial Revolution. After {{the introduction of the}} <b>Bessemer</b> process, <b>steel</b> and wrought iron became similarly priced, and some users, primarily railroads, turned to steel. Quality problems, such as brittleness caused by nitrogen in the blowing air, prevented <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> from being used for many structural applications. [...] Open-hearth steel was suitable for structural applications.|$|R

5000|$|Brown Bayley Steels was a steel-making company {{established}} in Sheffield, England in 1871, as Brown, Bayley & Dixon.

50|$|The company {{reached its}} peak in the late 1890s, at which point {{it had become a}} major {{integrated}} producer of pig iron, <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel,</b> and steel products, employing a workforce of over 8,000 people.In 1899 the Cleveland Rolling Mill Company was absorbed into the American Steel and Wire Company of New Jersey, which was in turn merged into J. P. Morgan's U.S. Steel conglomerate two years later.|$|R
25|$|Carnegie {{made his}} fortune in the steel industry, {{controlling}} the most extensive integrated iron and steel operations ever owned by an individual in the United States. One of his two great innovations was in the cheap and efficient mass production of steel by adopting and adapting the <b>Bessemer</b> process for <b>steel</b> making. Sir Henry Bessemer had invented the furnace which allowed the high carbon content of pig iron to be burnt away in a controlled and rapid way. The steel price dropped as a direct result, and <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was rapidly adopted for rails; however, it was not suitable for buildings and bridges.|$|R
500|$|The ships' armor {{protection}} {{consisted of}} an armored belt that was [...] thick and was capped with [...] thick transverse bulkheads on {{either end of}} the citadel. Only the two strakes of the belt armor were newly manufactured; the rest of the iron used to protect the casemate deck came from the earlier Kaiser Max class. The casemate battery was protected with [...] thick plates. The new belt armor consisted of <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The AA {{organized}} the independently-owned Pittsburgh <b>Bessemer</b> <b>Steel</b> Works in Homestead in 1881. The AA {{engaged in a}} bitter strike at the Homestead works on January 1, 1882 {{in an effort to}} prevent management from including a non-union clause in the workers' contracts, known as a [...] "yellow-dog contract". Violence occurred on both sides, and the plant brought in numerous strikebreakers. The strike ended on March 20 in a complete victory for the union.|$|R
2500|$|On November 9, 1862, Stone, Chisholm & Jones reorganized {{and became}} the Cleveland Rolling Mill after {{receiving}} investments from Henry B. Payne, Jeptha Wade, and Stillman Witt. The company built a [...] high, [...] wide blast furnace in 1864 near {{the west end of}} what is now Saxe Avenue, and the following year erected its first Bessemer converter. This made the Cleveland Rolling Mill only the second <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> works in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{example is}} the <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> process - <b>Bessemer</b> sold a patent for his {{advanced}} steelmaking process and was sued by the purchasers who couldn't get it to work. In the end Bessemer set up his own steel company because {{he knew how to}} do it, even though he could not convey it to his patent users. Bessemer's company became {{one of the largest in}} the world and changed the face of steel making.|$|R
5000|$|The AA {{organized}} the independently-owned Pittsburgh <b>Bessemer</b> <b>Steel</b> Works in Homestead in 1881.

50|$|The ships' armor {{protection}} {{consisted of}} an armored belt that was 203 mm thick and was capped with 115 mm thick transverse bulkheads on {{either end of}} the citadel. Only the two strakes of the belt armor were newly manufactured; the rest of the iron used to protect the casemate deck came from the earlier Kaiser Max class. The casemate battery was protected with 125 mm thick plates. The new belt armor consisted of <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Another of Kirtley's {{achievements}} in 1859 was, at last, {{to solve the}} problem of coal burning, by combining the brick arch with a firehole door deflector plate and a blower to increase the draught. Research into track wear was carried out by Robert Forester Mushet, who produced the first double-headed rail using <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel.</b> Whereas wrought iron rails lasted typically six months, a length of steel rail laid near Derby station 1857 was still in use in 1873.|$|R
50|$|In the 1880s, the {{transition}} from wrought iron puddling to mass-produced <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> greatly increased worker productivity. Highly skilled workers remained essential, but the average level of skill declined. Nevertheless, steelworkers earned much more than ironworkers despite their fewer skills. Workers in an integrated, synchronized mass production environment wielded greater strategic power, for the greater cost of mistakes bolstered workers' status. The experience demonstrated that the new technology did not decrease worker bargaining leverage by creating an interchangeable, unskilled workforce.|$|R
50|$|The present {{hall was}} built between {{the years of}} 1863 and 1865 by the Sheffield architects Flockton & Abbot for the Sheffield {{industrialist}} John Brown. Brown had acquired considerable wealth and prestige from the manufacture of armour plate from <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> at his Atlas Works {{in the city and}} wanted to build a private residence to reflect his position as one of the Nouveau riche industrialist of the Victorian Age. It is the largest private residence ever to have been built in Sheffield.|$|R
5000|$|Additionally, {{there are}} several {{versions}} of the technological cycles, and they are best interpreted using diffusion curves of leading industries. For example, railways only started in the 1830s, with steady growth for the next 45 years. It was after <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> was introduced that railroads had their highest growth rates; however, this period is usually labeled the [...] "age of steel". Measured by value added, the leading industry in the U.S. from 1880 to 1920 was machinery, followed by iron and steel.|$|R
5000|$|To supply {{small scale}} power that was {{impractical}} for individual steam engines, central station hydraulic systems were developed. Hydraulic power {{was used to}} operate cranes and other machinery in British ports and elsewhere in Europe. The largest hydraulic system was in London. Hydraulic power was used extensively in <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> production. Hydraulic power was also used for elevators, to operate canal locks and rotating sections of bridges. [...] Some of these systems remained in use well into the twentieth century.|$|R
60|$|The speaker ceased, a {{smile of}} {{conscious}} merit upon his face. For the moment I could not {{say a word to}} him, I was so angry. But had I been able to say or do anything to indicate the wild indignation that filled my brain, I should have had no opportunity, for Mrs. Lecks stepped up to me and took me by the arm. Her face was very stern, and her expression gave one the idea of the rigidity of <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} railroad {{bridge was}} replaced by a swing bridge in 1879 that, along with the Glasgow Railroad Bridge across the Missouri River, was one of the United States' first all steel railroad bridges. This bridge was constructed from <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel,</b> which proved too brittle and so the bridge was replaced again in 1898. The replacement bridge was constructed on land and floated into position, allowing the old structure to be removed and the new one put in place in 27½ hours on March 13 and March 14, 1898.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> became brittle {{with age}} because {{nitrogen}} was introduced when air was blown in. [...] The Bessemer process was also restricted to certain ores (low phosphate hematite). [...] By {{the end of}} the 19th century the Bessemer process was displaced by the open hearth furnace (OHF). [...] After World War II the OHF was displaced by the basic oxygen furnace (BOF), which used oxygen instead of air and required about 35–40 minutes to produce a batch of steel compared to 8 to 9 hours for the OHF. The BOF also was more energy efficient.|$|R
50|$|In 1878, {{a fellow}} émigré and brother-in-law, Col. Felix de Nemegyei, hired {{him when he}} briefly lived in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to manage the Irondale Furnace near Independence, West Virginia, {{producing}} wrought iron. Both their wives were also sisters. He continued {{to live and work}} there until 1885, when the plant was closed down. The primary causes were the increasing competition from <b>Bessemer</b> <b>steel</b> and workers' demand for higher wages. In 1879, he provided a statement to Sophia Kroehl on the nature of her late husband's illness to be included in her pension application.|$|R
