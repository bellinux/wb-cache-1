40|$|Many {{omnivorous}} arthropods {{are important}} natural enemies {{because they can}} feed on plant-provided pollen and several prey species, and thus persist in crops {{even in the absence}} of the target pest. Hence, populations of these predators can be established in a crop by providing alternative food, thus increasing biological control. We investigated how alternative food affects <b>broad</b> <b>mite</b> (Polyphagotarsonemus latus) control on chilli pepper plants by predatory mites. The predatory mite Amblyseius herbicolus had high oviposition and population growth rates when fed with cattail pollen, chilli pepper pollen and bee-collected pollen, and a low rate on the alternative prey Tetranychus urticae. Supplementing pepper plants with pollen resulted in better control of <b>broad</b> <b>mite</b> populations.

50|$|The {{host range}} {{includes}} the immature stages of western flower thrips, common blossom thrips, onion thrips, melon thrips and chilli thrips, {{as well as}} those of silverleaf whitefly and greenhouse whitefly. It can also consume Asian citrus psyllid, <b>broad</b> <b>mites,</b> and other herbivorous mites. When these prey species are not available, it is able to survive and reproduce on a diet of pollen and plant exudates, although its fecundity and growth rates are reduced under these circumstances. Where two prey species are available, it will prey on the most available one. For example, in a 2016 research project on field grown cucumber plants, it was successful in controlling melon thrips on the leaves, but not common blossom thrips on the flowers of the same plants.|$|R
40|$|Biological {{control in}} sweet pepper {{has been one}} of the success stories of the {{greenhouse}} industry for decades. This success is mainly based on inoculative releases of anthocorid predatory bugs and generalist phytoseiid predatory mites, which successfully control thrips, <b>broad</b> <b>mites</b> and whiteflies. One of the last obstacles for a completely pesticide-free cropping system are aphids. Sweet pepper in particular is often quickly damaged by aphids, mainly by the peach aphid Myzus persicae (Sulzer), the foxglove aphid Aulacorthum solani (Kaltenbach) and the cotton aphid Aphis gossypii (Glover), because of their extremely fast development in this crop. Biological control of these pests in sweet pepper is difficult and expensive, as effective control requires repeated releases of natural enemies. So far, aphid control strategies are mainly based on frequent releases of specialized aphid parasitoids and the predatory midge Aphidoletes aphidimyza (Rondani). Additionally, growers release chrysopid, syrphid or coccinellid predators to suppress high aphid densities. However, none of these natural enemies is able to establish in a crop without aphids. Biological control of aphids might be greatly improved by generalist predators that are able to establish in a sweet pepper crop prior to aphid infestations, because this can result in rapid responses to new aphid infestations and prevent establishment of aphids...|$|R
40|$|The {{initial test}} of the Biosphere 2 {{agricultural}} system {{was to provide a}} nutritionally adequate diet for eight crew members during a two year closure xperiment, 199 1 - 1993. The overall results of that trial are presented inthis paper. The 2000 mz cropping area provided about 80 percent of overall nutritional needs during the two years. Adaptation of the crew to the diet which averaged 2200 calories, 73 g. of protein and 32 g. of fat per person {{over the course of the}} two years. The diet was primarily vegetarian, with only small amounts of milk, meat and eggs from the system’s domestic animals. The crew experienced lo- 20 percent weight loss, most of which occurred in the first six months of the closure reflecting adaptation tothe diet and lower caloric intake during that period. Since Biosphere 2 is a tightly sealed system, non-toxic methods of pest and disease control were employed and inedible plant material, domestic animal wastes and human waste-water were processed and nutrients returned to the soil. Crop pests and diseases, especially <b>broad</b> <b>mites</b> and rootknot nematode, reduced yields, and forced the use of alternative crops.

40|$|Mite {{problems}} in different agroecosystems in Romania are presented. Of all phytophagous mites {{known in the}} country, four species are found {{on a wide range}} of crops, with the two-spotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae Koch, and the <b>broad</b> <b>mite,</b> Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), being the most important. The <b>broad</b> <b>mite</b> is difficult to control, but acaricides registered in Romania have provided effective control of this species. Reduction of highly toxic pesticide residues in the environment has been considered important in the country. That could be approached by first reducing the amount of pesticides applied on agricultural land, and second, by finding new pesticides with less toxic active ingredients. This has resulted in reduced numbers of the main groups of pesticides, commercial products and number of active substances. The number of available commercial products varied from 12 in 1972 – 1979 to five in 1980 – 1989, ten in 1990 – 1996, four in 1997 – 2004 and six in 2010, based on five active ingredients. The causes of the decreasing numbers of acaricide products or active ingredients were the reduced availability of several active ingredients due to toxicological or environmental reasons and the high registration cost. Only three acaricides (Envidor 240 SC, Nissorun 10 WP and Omite 570 EC) and one insecticide/acaricide (Seizer 10 EC) are at present commonly used in Romanian agriculture. At the same time, from the economic point of view, biological control is impractical if not impossible to be applied in commercial crop production under Romanian economical conditions of farmers in absence of subsidies. EU and Romanian policies are discussed. Key words: Acaricides, chemical control, mites importance, plant pest...|$|E

3000|$|It {{was clear}} from the current {{investigation}} that A. swirskii and N. cucumeris were differed in their capabilities to control F. occidentalis on tomato plants, where A. swirskii was more efficient as a bioagent than N. cucumeris. These findings are similar to those obtained by van Houten et al. (2005) who found that the release of A. swirskii led to a better establishment and superior for F. occidentalis control on sweet pepper over 6  weeks compared with N. cucumeris. Arthurs et al. (2009) also showed that A. swirskii and N. cucumeris were good and effective predators for Scirtothrips dorsalis on sweet pepper but the efficiency of N. cucumeris was less than A. swirskii. Similarly, Stansly and Castillo (2010) observed low efficiency in controlling whiteflies and <b>broad</b> <b>mites</b> by N. cucumeris as compared with A. swirskii on eggplant and pepper under field conditions in south Florida. Moreover, Lee and Gillespie (2011) demonstrated that A. swirskii in the Mediterranean region with an optimum temperature for survival and growth might have better adaptation to this local temperature than N. cucumeris. Kakkar et al. (2016) found that A. swirskii was more effective in diminishing Thrips palmi (Karny) populations than N. cucumeris on cucumber leaves. So, we could suggest that A. swirskii had a higher adaption for the greenhouse conditions than N. cucumeris under the hydroponic system.

The objective {{of this study was to}} develop alternative food sources for A. swirskii in support of it mass production and use as food supplements to sustain it populations after release in the crop. Two factitious foods (Ephestia kuehniella eggs and decapsulated cysts of Artemia franciscana) and meridic artificial diets (composed of honey, sucrose, tryptone, yeast extract, and egg yolk) supplemented with pupal hemolymph of Antheraea pernyi, with E. kuehniella eggs, with A. franciscana cysts or prepupal hemolymph of Hermetia illucens were investigated. The predatory mite performed best on decapsulated Artemia cysts and the artificial diet enriched with these cysts, indicating the potential for use of these foods in (parts of) the production cycle of the predator. A powdered artificial diet supplemented with A. franciscana cysts is believed to have potential for use as a supplemental food to sustain populations of the predatory mite in greenhouse crops. Further, our findings indicate the potential of using H. illucens as a cheap source of hemolymph in artificial diets for predatory mites and possibly other predatory arthropods. The artificial diet supplemented with A. franciscana also supported the development and reproduction of four species of other phytoseiid mites which are commercially available for biological control (Neoseiulus californicus, N. cucumeris, Amblyseius andersoni, and Amblydromalus limonicus) ...|$|R

40|$|A new {{technique}} to control phytophagous mites was tested in West Africa on the African eggplant Solanum macrocarpon. This technique consisted of covering plants {{with a net}} impregnated with the acaricide dicofol. The net was applied during the night to protect the net fabric and the active ingredient from UV degradation and to avoid interference of the net with overhead watering. The technique was evaluated in three trials at the INRAB research station and in a grower's field in 2006 and 2007. Results showed that the <b>broad</b> <b>mite</b> Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks), the major pest of S. macrocarpon which causes severe damage to leaves, and spider mites (Tetranychus spp.), were completely controlled by the dicofol-treated net Very few mites and practically no mite injury were observed on plants covered with the dicofol-treated net compared to 12 - 94 % damaged leaves in the unprotected control plots. The acaricide-treated net was as efficient when used temporarily (once every three nights) as when used every night. No difference in the percentages of leaves damaged by mites was apparent at harvest between plots covered with a non-acaricide deltamethrin-treated net (40 %) and unprotected control (32 %). This new concept of mite control using an acaricide-treated net temporarily covering vegetable crop {{appears to be an}} efficient tool which is easy to use.

Total developmental times of 13. 3, 10. 5, 6. 6, 4. 2, 3. 5 and 4. 0 days were measured, respective to each of the aforementioned temperatures. Development of females took significantly longer than that of males at 15, 17, 20 and 30 A degrees C. Survival rates observed between 17 and 30 A degrees C varied between 43. 5 and 96. 9 %.

Four rat species were identified namely, Rattus tiomanicus (45. 7 %), Rattus rattus diardii (25. 9 %), Rattus argentiventer (16 %) and Rattus norvegicus (12. 3 %). Low diversity of ecto and endoparasites were observed infecting the rodent population with 8 ecto and 8 endoparasites species recorded.

Therefore, this technology has also become attractive for tactical networks, such as in command posts, vehicle convoys, autonomous robot systems, and also for infantry troops. Due to its radio characteristics, it is widely known that MANETs may become subject to different kinds of attacks against their availability and against the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of the information that is transmitted, processed, and stored on their devices. In terms of information assurance, many protective measures need to be applied to these networks in order to make them deployable even for critical missions - in terms of intrusion prevention, detection, resistance, and response. MITE (MANET Intrusion Detection for Tactical Environments) is a collaborative research project that aims at developing prototypical solutions for intrusion detection in MANETs - especially in tactical scenarios.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} plant species for biofuel production in Brazil is the physic nut Jatropha curcas. Major phytosanitary problems include the attack of two pest mite species, the <b>broad</b> <b>mite</b> Polyphagotarsonemus latus and the spider mite Tetranychus bastosi. Owing to pesticide-related problems, there is an increasing demand for sustainable environmental-friendly control methods such as biological control. In this study we evaluated the suitability of the predatory mite species Iphiseiodes zuluagai and Euseius concordis in controlling P. latus and T. bastosi on J. curcas. The number of T. bastosi killed by I. zuluagai was lower than the number of P. latus consumed. Euseius concordis preyed upon both T. bastosi and P. latus but the number of prey killed was always lower in comparison with I. zuluagai. However, P. latus and T. bastosi are suitable for the development of I. zuluagai and E. concordis as oviposition of both predators did not differ in relation to prey species. The preference of I. zuluagai for leaves of plants infested by either P. latus or T. bastosi, combined with the higher values for predation obtained by this predatory mite when fed on P. latus, compared to those values obtained by E. concordis, suggests that I. zuluagai can be more efficient than E. concordis in reducing populations of P. latus and T. bastosi under field conditions. Furthermore, we report here on the first record of predatory mites associated with P. latus and T. bastosi on native J. curcas plants in Brazil.

(Solanales: Solanaceae), a leafy vegetable on which it causes considerable damage to the plants and substantial reduction in yield. Predatory mites in the family Phytoseiidae have been successfully used in the biological control of numerous agricultural pests worldwide. In that respect, a population of the phytoseiid mite Amblyseius swirskii (Athias-Henriot) (Mesostigmata: Phytoseiidae) {{has been identified as}} a potential predator of P. latus, and is now a candidate for release against this pest in Benin. The objective of the present study is to determine, through laboratory experiments, the predation rate and life table parameters of A. swirskii when feeding on P. latus or alternative food such as maize pollen. Under laboratory conditions the mean number of P. latus consumed by A. swirskii, and daily oviposition, significantly increased as the number of prey increased. Total development time of A. swirskii was significantly shorter when it fed on P. latus than on maize pollen. Net reproduction rate, intrinsic rate of increase, mean generation time and the finite rate of increase of A. swirskii were were all significantly lower on P. latus than on maize pollen. However, doubling time was significantly higher on maize pollen. This study shows that A. swirskii is a good predator of P. latus, and that maize pollen can efficiently sustain A. swirskii populations when P. latus densities on plants become low.

Adult females were also exposed to temperatures of 2 and - 3 degrees C. Further, the supercooling point and lower lethal times of adult females were determined. No eggs survived exposure to 7 degrees C for 17 or more days. Larval survival upon the cold treatment decreased from 53 to 13 % when exposed to 7 degrees C for 14 and 49 days, respectively. Two-day-old adult females exposed to 7 degrees C for up to 42 days did not suffer significant mortality, but when returned to 25 degrees C their oviposition rates were {{lower than those of}} mites maintained at 25 degrees C. Less than 40 % of females exposed for 13 days to 2 degrees C survived; only 20 % of these females was able to reproduce upon recovery. Subzero temperatures dramatically decreased survival and reproduction capacity of adult females. The supercooling point of female adults was - 16. 5 degrees C. Median lethal times averaged 61. 2 h and 9. 3 days at - 3 and 2 degrees C, respectively. In conclusion, a long term exposure (up to 6 weeks) of R. simsii plants infested with P. latus to a temperature of 7 degrees C, which is required for breaking dormancy of the flowers, is not expected to have detrimental effects on the survival and reproductive performance of the female mites...|$|E

Biological parameters of L. floridensis were compared when exposed to P. latus and to other items as food. The study showed that mating is a pre-requisite for L. floridensis to oviposit and that oviposition rate was much higher on the soil nematode Rhabditella axei (Cobbold) (Rhabditidae) than on P. latus. Ovipositon on the acarid mite Tyrophagus putrescentiae (Schrank) was about the same as on P. latus, but it was nearly zero when the predator was fed the fungi Aspergillus flavus Link or Penicillium sp., or cattail (Typha sp.) pollen. Survivorship was higher in the presence of pollen and lower in the presence of A. flavus or Penicillium sp. than in the absence of those types of food. Life table parameters indicated that the predator performed much better on R. axei than on P. latus. To evaluate the potential effect of L. floridensis as predator of P. latus, complementary studies are warranted to determine the frequency of migration of L. floridensis to aerial plant parts, when predation on P. latus could occur.
