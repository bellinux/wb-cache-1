40|$|This {{article has}} two aims. First, {{it seeks to}} {{demonstrate}} that the democratic credentials <b>of</b> statutory <b>rights</b> instruments are stronger than <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> sceptics such as Professors James Allan and Jeremy Waldron realise. It does so by examining the process by which statutory <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> are enacted and then provides an account as to why they are adopted that differs from the one offered by Allan and Waldron. This is done to suggest that the reason why a statutory rights instrument is adopted and the process itself has considerable democratic significance. And second, it seeks to assess the democratic credentials of Professor Allan 2 ̆ 7 s own critique <b>of</b> statutory <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights.</b> The analysis undertaken in this regard reveals that in important respects Allan is anything but the majoritarian democrat that he routinely claims to be. <br /...|$|R

5|$|After {{several years}} of {{comparatively}} weak government under the Articles of Confederation, a Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia proposed a new constitution on September 17, 1787, featuring a stronger chief executive and other changes. George Mason, a Constitutional Convention delegate and the drafter of Virginia's Declaration of Rights, proposed that a <b>bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> listing and guaranteeing civil liberties be included. Other delegatesincluding future <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> drafter James Madisondisagreed, arguing that existing state guarantees of civil liberties were sufficient and that any attempt to enumerate individual rights risked the implication that other, unnamed rights were unprotected. After a brief debate, Mason's proposal was defeated by a unanimous vote of the state delegations.|$|E
5|$|Although Madison's {{proposed}} amendments {{included a}} provision {{to extend the}} protection {{of some of the}} <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> to the states, the amendments that were finally submitted for ratification applied only to the federal government. The door for their application upon state governments was opened in the 1860s, following ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment. Since the early 20th century both federal and state courts have used the Fourteenth Amendment to apply portions of the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> to state and local governments. The process is known as incorporation.|$|E

They considered only law review journals that had been ranked by the ARC as A or A* ones, solely to have a circumscribed list of journals to consider. They then assessed whether each such article was positive about <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> negative about them, neutral, or whether the mention was peripheral.

5|$|By {{the time}} the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> was {{submitted}} to the states for ratification, opinions had shifted in both parties. Many Federalists, who had previously opposed a <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights,</b> now supported the Bill {{as a means of}} silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective criticism. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> is {{the first}} ten {{amendments}} to the United States Constitution. Proposed following the oftentimes bitter 1787–88 battle over ratification of the U.S. Constitution, and crafted to address the objections raised by Anti-Federalists, the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> amendments add to the Constitution specific guarantees of personal freedoms and rights, clear limitations on the government's power in judicial and other proceedings, and explicit declarations that all powers not specifically delegated to Congress by the Constitution are reserved for the states or the people. The concepts codified in these amendments are built upon those found in several earlier documents, including the Virginia Declaration of Rights and the English <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> 1689, along with earlier documents such as Magna Carta (1215). In practice, the amendments had little impact on judgements by the courts for the first 150 years after ratification.|$|E
5|$|The Federalist Papers (specifically Federalist No. 84) are {{notable for}} their {{opposition}} to what later became the United States <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights.</b> The idea of adding a <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> to the Constitution was originally controversial because the Constitution, as written, did not specifically enumerate or {{protect the rights of}} the people, rather it listed the powers of the government and left all that remained to the states and the people. Alexander Hamilton, the author of Federalist No. 84, feared that such an enumeration, once written down explicitly, would later be interpreted as a list of the only rights that people had.|$|E
5|$|The Second Amendment {{protects the}} {{individual}} {{right to keep}} and bear arms. The concept of such a right existed within English common law long before the enactment of the <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights.</b> First codified in the English <b>Bill</b> <b>of</b> <b>Rights</b> of 1689 (but there only applying to Protestants), this right was enshrined in fundamental laws of several American states during the Revolutionary era, including the 1776 Virginia Declaration of Rights and the Pennsylvania Constitution of 1776. Long a controversial issue in American political, legal, and social discourse, the Second Amendment has been at the heart of several Supreme Court decisions.|$|E

5000|$|Abolitionist Lysander Spooner, {{commenting on}} <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights,</b> {{stated that the}} object <b>of</b> all <b>bills</b> <b>of</b> <b>rights</b> is to assert the <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> {{individuals}} against the government and that the Second Amendment {{right to keep and}} bear arms was in support <b>of</b> the <b>right</b> to resist government oppression, as the only security against the tyranny of government lies in forcible resistance to injustice, for injustice will certainly be executed, unless forcibly resisted. Spooner's theory provided the intellectual foundation for John Brown and other radical abolitionists who believed that arming slaves was not only morally justified, but entirely consistent with the Second Amendment. An express connection between this right and the Second Amendment was drawn by Lysander Spooner who commented that a [...] "right of resistance" [...] is protected by both the right to trial by jury and the Second Amendment.|$|R
