40|$|Effective {{environmental}} management requires monitoring programmes that provide specific links between changes in environmental conditions and ecosystem health. This article reviews {{the suitability of}} a range of <b>bioindicators</b> for use in monitoring programmes that link changes in water quality to changes in the condition of coral-reef ecosystems. From the literature, 21 candidate <b>bioindicators</b> were identified, whose responses to changes in water quality varied spatially and temporally; responses ranged from rapid (hours) changes within individual corals to long-term (years) changes in community composition. From this list, the most suitable <b>bioindicators</b> were identified by determining whether responses were (i) specific, (ii) monotonic, (iii) variable, (iv) practical and (v) ecologically relevant to management goals. For long-term monitoring programmes that aim to quantify the effects of chronic changes in water quality, 11 <b>bioindicators</b> were selected: symbiont photophysiology, colony brightness, tissue thickness and surface rugosity of massive corals, skeletal elemental and isotopic composition, abundance of macro-bioeroders, micro- and meiobenthic organisms such as foraminifera, coral recruitment, macroalgal cover, taxonomic richness of corals and the maximal depth of coralreef development. For short-term monitoring programmes, or environmental impact assessments that aim to quantify the effects of acute changes in water quality, a subset of seven of these <b>bioindicators</b> were selected, including partial mortality. Their choice will depend on the specific objectives and the timeframe available for each monitoring programme. An assessment framework is presented to assist in the selection of <b>bioindicators</b> to quantify the effects of changing water quality on coral-reef ecosystems...|$|R

In one 1977 study, samples collected from grassy areas near the side of an interstate highway in Connecticut were shown to have high concentrations of cadmium and lead.

5|$|Habitat {{degradation}} and pollution are major threats to their conservation; river otters are highly sensitive to pollution and readily accumulate {{high levels of}} mercury, organochloride compounds, and other chemical elements. The species is often used as a <b>bioindicator</b> because of its position {{at the top of}} the food chain in aquatic ecosystems. Environmental disasters, such as oil spills, may increase levels of blood haptoglobin and interleukin-6 immunoreactive protein, but decrease body mass. Home ranges of river otters increase in size on oiled areas compared to unoiled areas, and individual otters also modify their habitat use. Declines in the richness and diversity of prey species may explain these changes.|$|E
5|$|Imposex has {{recently}} been detected in Laevistrombus canarium. Imposex {{is the development of}} male sex organs in female animals exposed to man-made organic tin compounds, such as tributyltin (TBT). It has negative consequences for several species of sea snails, ranging from sterility in some individuals to the extinction of entire populations. Tin compounds are biocidal anti-fouling agents mixed into paints to prevent marine encrustations on boats and ships. High concentrations of these compounds are commonly present in seawater near shipyards and docking areas, exposing nearby marine life to harmful effects. In a 2011 paper, Cob and colleagues found that imposex rates are high in dog conch populations near Malaysian ports; however, the researchers could not detect any cases of sterility in affected females. The authors concluded that females of L.canarium often develop a penis when seawater contains organotin compounds, but the phenomenon does not cause sterility in this species. The ability of the dog conch to survive despite imposex makes this species a suitable local <b>bioindicator</b> for organotin pollution.|$|E

Their role includes the biotransformation of petroleum compounds into harmless compounds. In this paper, the use of biological activities as potential monitoring tools or <b>bioindicators</b> during bioremediation of hydrocarbon-contaminated soil are reviewed. The use of biological activities as <b>bioindicators</b> of hydrocarbon removal in soil has been reported with variable success. This variability can be attributed partially to the spatial variability of soil properties, which undoubtedly plays a role in the exposure of organisms to contaminants. Widely used <b>bioindicators</b> have been enzyme activities, seed germination, earthworm survival and microorganisms or microbial bioluminescence. A mixture of some successful utilization of biological activities and several failures, and inconsistencies reported, show that at this stage there is no general guarantee of successful utilization of biological activities as monitoring tools. Wherever possible, the use of biological activities as <b>bioindicators</b> of hydrocarbon removal must be used to complement existing traditional monitoring tool...|$|R
40|$|<b>Bioindicators</b> are {{effective}} tools for evaluating ecosystem condition. Weight-length models {{are essential to}} using fish as <b>bioindicators,</b> providing expected weights for healthy fish of given lengths. The traditional model, W(L) = aLb, is widely used and fits many fish taxa but is error-prone and has undesirably large uncertainties. This study evaluated a proposed improvement, replacing ܽ with scaling parameter L 1 : W(L) = 1000 (L/L 1) b. The primary hypothesis was that the proposed model would have lower mean parameter uncertainties than the traditional model and smaller uncertainties in most data sets, yielding more accurate <b>bioindicators.</b> The models were compared for 160 data sets including 94 taxa containing 14, 102 data points. Each set was fit to the traditional model and the proposed improvement with appropriate regression techniques. The improved model yielded lower uncertainties for L 1 but similar uncertainties to the traditional model for b. Lower L 1 uncertainties provide more sensitive <b>bioindicators.</b> The secondary hypothesis was supported: L 1 shows promise a...|$|R

A 2009 study found that P. ochraceus is unlikely to be affected by ocean acidification as severely as other marine animals with calcareous skeletons. In other groups, structures made of calcium carbonate are vulnerable to dissolution when the pH is lowered. Researchers found that when P. ochraceus were exposed to [...] and 770ppm carbon dioxide (beyond rises expected in the next century), they were relatively unaffected. Their survival is likely due to the nodular nature of their skeletons, which are able to compensate for a shortage of carbonate by growing more fleshy tissue.|$|E

(Mc Geoch & Chown, 1998). The spatial distribution of parasitic copepods from teleost fishes (Chelon labrosus, Mugil cephalus, Liza aurata and Dicentrarchus labrax) was studied in two sites (Annaba gulf and El Mellah lagoon) in the eastern Algeria coastline using indicator species analysis (Indval) to identify parasite species as <b>bioindicators</b> of a given ecosystem during 2005 - 2008, also identified parasites as <b>bioindicators</b> relative to host.

40|$|International audienceA key step in {{assessing}} microbial community in soil is sample preparation. Soil samples amounts {{that are needed}} are usually small (in the mg-level in case of molecular techniques up to few g for enzymatic analysis) and frequently stored before microbial analysis. Furthermore for several analyses, soil cannot be incorporated in the test and microbial community should be extracted from the soil in an aqueous solution. The objective of this work was thus to study the influence of soil preparation on microbial <b>bioindicators</b> response. For this, a set of <b>bioindicators</b> (biomass, biodiversity (SSCP), denitrifier abundance (quantification of napA and narG genes), carbon mineralization (Biolog), protein synthesis (3 H-leucine incorporation activity) was tested to three agricultural soils. The response of molecular <b>bioindicators</b> based on DNA extraction (16 S RNA for bacterial biomass assessment and napA and narG for denitrifier abundance) was reproducible (n = 3) even if the extraction was done on 0. 5 g of soil only, and the microbial diversity, genes abundance and biomass obtained for separated extractions were similar. On the opposite, soil microbial extraction needed {{for the analysis of}} some <b>bioindicators</b> (such as Biolog) resulted in a microbial community structure significantly {{different from that of the}} corresponding soil, which has to be taken into account during results analysis since the extraction modify the environmental variable effect reported on the community structure and gene abundance.

By using <b>bioindicators,</b> {{it is possible to}} assess the impact of human activities on the biota, instead of examining the entire biota. In this paper we analyzed diversity of dung beetles (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) across land use gradient in Central Sulawesi and tested the suitability of dung beetles as <b>bioindicators</b> for environmental changes. Ninety baited pitfall trapswere placed and several habitat parametersweremeasured at five land-use types ranging from natural forest to cacao agroforestry systems to open areas in 2009 and 2012. The effectiveness of dung beetles as <b>bioindicators</b> of environmental changes was evaluated by the method, a method combining the specificity and fidelity of certain species with particular types of habitat or environmental conditions. Surprisingly, the results showed that the diversity of dung beetles in two types of cacao plantations were similar to the forest sites and were significantly higher than the open cultivated area. Of the 16 dung beetles species analyzed only four species could be suggested as indicator (characteristic) species while the majority of collected species were categorized as detector species. Two of them (and) were associated with natural forest and cacao agroforestry system, thus were suggested as the indicator of shaded and cooler habitats whereas and can be suggested as indicator of unshaded andwarmer habitats (bare land area). <b>bioindicators,</b> diversity, Scarabaeidae, habitat preferences,. 1 * 1...|$|R
