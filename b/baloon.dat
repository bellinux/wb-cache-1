40|$|We {{propose a}} {{nonlinear}} self-consistent {{model of the}} turbulent non-resonant particle acceleration in solar flares. We simulate temporal evolution of the spectra of charged particles accelerated by strong long-wavelength MHD turbulence taking into account back reaction of the accelerated particles on the turbulence. The main finding is that the nonlinear coupling of accelerated particles with MHD turbulence results in prominent evolution of the spectra of accelerated particles, which can be either soft-hard-soft or soft-hard-harder depending on the particle injection efficiency. Such evolution patterns are widely observed in hard X-ray and gamma-ray emission from solar flares. Subject headings: Sun: flares—acceleration of particles—turbulence—diffusion— shock waves—Sun: X-rays, gamma rays A solar flare arises due to fast and spatially localized strong energy release and reveals itself in electromagnetic radiation and particle flows.

40|$|ABSTRACTPrevious {{studies show}} that {{exposure}} to low frequency noise (LFN) (≤ 500 Hz, including infrasound) produces irreversible lesions in Wistar rat respiratory epithelia. Recovery periods for LFN-induced lesions have thus become an object of interest. Changes in the respiratory epithelia of Wistar rats after continuous short-term exposure to LFN are described. Twelve rats were exposed to continuous LFN for 48 hrs, and 10 age-matched rats were kept in silence. Animals were treated in accordance with 86 / 609 /CE. After exposure ceased, two rodents were sacrificed immediately, and another two after 6, 12, 24, 48 hrs, and 7 days of post-exposure silence. Respiratory epithelial fragments were prepared for light and scanning/ transmission electron microscopy. Six hours after exposure, intense and irregular cellular tumefaction was visible and rosetta structures, formed by secretory cells (SC) centered on a brush cell (BC), were identifiable. Cilia were shorter and shaggy. BC microvilli tended to group, losing the uniform distribution seen in controls. Twelve hours after exposure, cell <b>balooning</b> was still present, BC shape was highly irregular and microvilli were grouped. SC microvilli were still shorter than controls. Seven days after exposure, controls and exposed were indistinguishable. LFN-induced epithelial lesions seem to be reversible if recovery periods are respected.

In acute intoxication, after intracreneal inoculation, severe alterations were seen within 20 to 30 minutes in the cells of the spinal cord, specially in motor cells and also in some cells of the posterior cord and spinal bulb.

40|$|Introduction. Stent {{entrapment}} and dislodgment in the {{coronary arteries}} {{is a rare}} but potentially fatal complication of percutaneous coronary intervention. Different retrival techniques of dislodged stents have previously been reported with high success rate {{but all of them}} are timeconsuming, so as not quite useful in hemodinamically unstable patient. Case report. A 59 -year old female patient with acute ST-elevation myocardial infaction of anterior wall was admitted for primary percutanous coronary intervention. Unexpectedly, during intervention stent entrapment and dislodgement in the distal left main coronary artery occured followed by occlusive coronary dissection and compromisation of the coronary flow in the left descending coronary artery with a rapid hemodinamic deterioration. In order to reestablish coronary flow as soon as possible, the dislodged unexpanded stent was crushed against the wall with a balloon in the distal left main. It immediately restored coronary flow in the left descending coronary artery and rapidly improved the patients hemodinamics. Intervention was successfuly completed with totally four stents implanted in the left main, the osteoproxymal circumflex coronary artery and the osteo-proxymedial left descending coronary artery. Later postinterventional hospital course as well as the clinical and angiographic six month follow-up was uneventful. Conclusion. This case shows that percutaneous <b>baloon</b> crushing technique can be a safe and effective first option in management of dislodged and unexpanded stent in the left main coronary artery, particularly for a hemodynamically unstable patient...|$|E
