[...] (1990), the titular mailman, {{portrayed by}} John Ratzenberger, {{appears on the}} show and racks up an {{impressive}} $22,000 going into the Final Jeopardy! round, well ahead of his competitors. Despite having a total that his competitors cannot reach in Final Jeopardy!, Cliff risks all of his winnings on the final clue, which is revealed to be [...] "Archibald Leach, Bernard Schwartz and Lucille LeSueur" [...] (the real names of Cary Grant, Tony Curtis, and Joan Crawford, respectively). Cliff's response, [...] "Who are three people who've never <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> kitchen?", is deemed incorrect, and he leaves with no money.|$|E
500|$|Victoria and Ernst proved incompatible. Victoria despaired of her husband's lack {{of affection}} towards her, while Ernst devoted {{much of his}} {{attention}} to their daughter, whom he adored. Elisabeth, who physically resembled her mother, preferred the company of her father to Victoria. Ernst and Victoria both enjoyed entertaining and frequently held house parties for young friends. Their unwritten rule was that anyone over thirty [...] "was old and out." [...] Formality was dispensed with and royal house guests were referred to by their nicknames and encouraged to do as they wished. Victoria and Ernst cultivated friends who were progressive artists and intellectuals {{as well as those}} who enjoyed fun and frolic. Victoria's cousin Prince Nicholas of Greece and Denmark remembered one stay there as [...] "the jolliest, merriest house party to which I have ever <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." ...|$|E

King became the youngest assistant manager of a newspaper delivery station for the Atlanta Journal in 1942 when he was 13. During his junior year, he won first prize in an oratorical contest sponsored by the Negro Elks Club in Dublin, Georgia. Returning home to Atlanta by bus, he and his teacher were ordered by the driver to stand so that white passengers could sit down. King initially refused, but complied after his teacher told him that he would be breaking the law if he did not submit. King said that during this incident, he was [...] "the angriest I have ever <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life." [...] A precocious student, he skipped both the ninth and the twelfth grades of high school.|$|E

500|$|During {{a writing}} session at McCartney's house in north London, Lennon and McCartney {{fine-tuned}} the lyrics, using {{an approach that}} author Howard Sounes likens to the cut-up technique popularised by William Burroughs. [...] "I didn't copy the accident," [...] Lennon said. [...] "Tara didn't blow his mind out, {{but it was in}} my mind when I was writing that verse. The details of the accident in the song—not noticing traffic lights and a crowd forming at the scene—were similarly part of the fiction." [...] McCartney expounded on the subject: [...] "The verse about the politician blowing his mind out in a car we wrote together. It has been attributed to Tara Browne, the Guinness heir, which I don't believe is the case, certainly as we were writing it, I was not attributing it to Tara in my head. In John's head it might have <b>been.</b> <b>In</b> <b>my</b> head I was imagining a politician bombed out on drugs who'd stopped at some traffic lights and didn't notice that the lights had changed. The 'blew his mind' was purely a drugs reference, nothing to do with a car crash." ...|$|E
500|$|Cliff Clavin (John Ratzenberger) competes on the {{television}} game show Jeopardy!, which has temporarily moved taping to Boston for a special occasion, and amasses $22,000 {{by the end of}} the Double Jeopardy! round, more than twice the score of the second place contestant, theoretically ensuring a win. For the Final Jeopardy! clue of [...] "Archibald Leach, Bernard Schwartz and Lucille LeSueur" [...] in the category of [...] "Movies", Cliff responds incorrectly with [...] "Who are 3 people who've never <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> kitchen?" [...] Having wagered his entire score, Cliff loses all of his winnings. Cliff objects and argues, demanding that his answer be accepted. The show's host, Alex Trebek, later arrives at Cheers, tells Cliff that his response should have been accepted earlier, and announces his resignation as the host of Jeopardy!. However, Cliff convinces Trebek to remain as host by telling him how much the show and Trebek mean to him. After Cliff shares the news with others, Norm Peterson (George Wendt) praises Trebek for doing this just to make Cliff feel better. However, Trebek says that he did not realize that Cliff was at the bar and that meeting him had been a coincidence. Trebek says that Cliff scares him and that the story about quitting the show was a fabrication to placate him.|$|E

To me, it was not disagreeable to look forward to a future of uncertainty and insecurity, with none of the slow inevitability of a career in the Government service; to feel myself, in however small a way, the master of my destiny. With my left foot I turned the hot-water tap full on and wallowed contentedly.|$|E
2500|$|Quarterback Kerry Collins led the Giants {{to victory}} by {{throwing}} for 381 yards and five {{touchdowns in the}} most lopsided game in NFC Championship Game history and the second most lopsided conference title game ever (after the 1990 AFC Championship Game). Meanwhile, the Giants shut out the Vikings by limiting them to only 114 offensive yards, sacking quarterback Daunte Culpepper four times, and forcing five turnovers, and handing the Vikings their first shutout and worst loss in their postseason history. New York wide receiver Ike Hilliard had 10 receptions for 155 yards and two touchdowns. The Minnesota sports community sometimes refers to this as [...] "41–doughnut" [...] after a post game comment from Randy Moss: [...] "I was just talking to Daunte, and 41-to-doughnut, I think that's the worst defeat I've ever <b>been</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life."
