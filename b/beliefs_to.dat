5|$|A {{few months}} ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best {{intentions}} still tell me that's true, but {{the facts and the}} evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages. This runs counter to my own <b>beliefs,</b> <b>to</b> administration policy, and to the original strategy we had in mind.|$|E
5|$|Aquino's Book of Coming Forth by Night makes {{reference}} to The Book of the Law, a similarly 'revealed' text {{produced by the}} occultist Aleister Crowley in 1904 which {{provided the basis for}} Crowley's religion of Thelema. In Aquino's book, The Book of the Law was presented as a genuine spiritual text given to Crowley by preternatural sources, but it was also declared that Crowley had misunderstood both its origin and message. In making {{reference to}} The Book of the Law, Aquino presented himself as being as much Crowley's heir as LaVey's, and Aquino's work would engage with Crowley's writings and <b>beliefs</b> <b>to</b> a far greater extent than LaVey ever did.|$|E
5|$|During an 11-month {{period of}} {{blindness}} in 1902, List became increasingly interested in occultism, in particular coming {{under the influence}} of the Theosophical Society, resulting in an expansion of his Wotanic <b>beliefs</b> <b>to</b> incorporate Runology and the Armanen Futharkh. The popularity of his work among the völkisch and nationalist communities resulted in the establishment of a List Society in 1908; attracting significant middle and upper-class support, the Society published List's writings and included an Ariosophist inner group, the High Armanen Order, over whom List presided as Grand Master.|$|E

5|$|Overall the {{operation}} appeared to meet few of its initial aims. The political approach did {{lead to an}} increased discussion amongst {{the lower levels of}} Swedish officialdom as to the possibility of an invasion in Norway. However, it failed to convince the higher levels of government (with the exception of Nordenskiöld, who did not communicate his <b>beliefs</b> <b>to</b> anyone). Even the purchase of Norwegian securities went unnoticed. The overriding belief within the Swedish government was that any invasion of Norway would be diversionary, and that the European mainland would always be the main target of the Allies.|$|E
5|$|After {{being thrown}} out of the theater by the manager, the gang shoplift from the Kwik-E-Mart, throw rocks at the Jebediah Springfield statue, and watch clouds. Bart remarks that one cloud resembles Jebediah Springfield, but without a head. His new friends remark that they wish someone would decapitate the statue, saying it would be funny to see the town so upset. When Bart disagrees, the bullies make fun of him. Bart is {{conflicted}} and asks Homer whether it is okay to compromise one's <b>beliefs</b> <b>to</b> be popular. Homer tells Bart that popularity {{is the most important thing}} in the world, as long as Bart is not talking about killing someone. That night, Bart sneaks out of the house and decapitates the statue.|$|E
5|$|As {{a member}} of a reserve {{battalion}} during World War I, Himmler did not see active service. He studied agronomy in college, and joined the Nazi Party in 1923 and the SS in 1925. In 1929, he was appointed Reichsführer-SS by Hitler. Over the next 16 years, he developed the SS from a mere 290-man battalion into a million-strong paramilitary group, and, following Hitler's orders, set up and controlled the Nazi concentration camps. He was known to have good organisational skills and for selecting highly competent subordinates, such as Reinhard Heydrich in 1931. From 1943 onwards, he was both Chief of German Police and Minister of the Interior, overseeing all internal and external police and security forces, including the Gestapo (Secret State Police). Himmler had a lifelong interest in occultism, interpreting Germanic neopagan and Völkisch <b>beliefs</b> <b>to</b> promote the racial policy of Nazi Germany, and incorporating esoteric symbolism and rituals into the SS.|$|E

5|$|When the {{predecessor}} of international fast food restaurant chain Burger King (BK) first opened in 1953, its menu predominantly consisted of hamburgers, French fries, soft drinks, milkshakes, and desserts. After being acquired by its Miami, Florida franchisees and renamed in 1954, BK began expanding its menu {{by adding the}} Whopper sandwich in 1957, and has since added non-beef items such as chicken, fish, and vegetarian offerings, including salads and meatless sandwiches. Other additions include a breakfast menu and beverages such as Icees, juices, and bottled waters. As the company expanded {{both inside and outside}} the United States, it introduced localized versions of its products that conform to regional tastes and cultural or religious <b>beliefs.</b> <b>To</b> generate additional sales, BK occasionally introduces limited-time offers of special versions of its products, or brings out completely new products intended for either long- or short-term sales. Not all of these products and services have been successful; in 1992, Burger King introduced limited table service featuring special dinner platters, but this concept failed to generate interest and was discontinued.|$|E

25|$|Since most people, {{and most}} cultures, {{substantially}} agree about most pure ethical situations, casuistry often creates ethical arguments that can persuade {{people of different}} ethnic, religious and philosophical <b>beliefs</b> <b>to</b> treat particular cases in the same ways.
