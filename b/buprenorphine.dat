5|$|On August 13, 2007, Adams {{was found}} {{unconscious}} {{in his bed}} by his youngest son (age 7) at their Tampa, Florida home. His son called 911, but Adams was pronounced dead by paramedics when they arrived. The medical examiner concluded that he {{died as a result}} of mixing the painkiller <b>buprenorphine</b> with the muscle relaxant carisoprodol and the sedatives chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam. The coroner determined the drugs in his system were individually at therapeutic levels, but their combination impeded his respiratory system enough to kill him. He was 43 years old.|$|E
5|$|Brian Keith Adams (April 14, 1964 – August 13, 2007) was an American {{professional}} wrestler. Adams is {{well known}} for his time with the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), under the name Crush, and for World Championship Wrestling (WCW) under his real name Brian Adams. Trained in Japan by Antonio Inoki, he was a two-time WCW World Tag Team Champion and a one-time WWF Tag Team Champion and a one-time AJPW World Tag Team Champion, among other titles and accomplishments. In 2002, he briefly tried a career in boxing until he was forced to retire due to back and shoulder injuries. He died of accidental respiratory failure from a combination of <b>buprenorphine,</b> carisoprodol, chlordiazepoxide and alprazolam.|$|E
5|$|Partial {{agonists}} {{are defined}} as drugs that, at a given receptor, might differ in the amplitude of the functional response that they elicit after maximal receptor occupancy. Although they are agonists, partial agonists {{can act as a}} competitive antagonist {{in the presence of a}} full agonist, as it competes with the full agonist for receptor occupancy, thereby producing a net decrease in the receptor activation as compared to that observed with the full agonist alone. Clinically, their usefulness is derived from their ability to enhance deficient systems while simultaneously blocking excessive activity. Exposing a receptor to a high level of a partial agonist will ensure that it has a constant, weak level of activity, whether its normal agonist is present at high or low levels. In addition, it has been suggested that partial agonism prevents the adaptive regulatory mechanisms that frequently develop after repeated exposure to potent full agonists or antagonists. <b>Buprenorphine,</b> a partial agonist of the μ-opioid receptor, binds with weak morphine-like activity and is used clinically as an analgesic in pain management and as an alternative to methadone in the treatment of opioid dependence.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the major}} active {{metabolites}} of <b>buprenorphine</b> is norbuprenorphine, which, contrary to <b>buprenorphine</b> itself, is a full agonist of the MOR, DOR, and ORL-1, and a partial agonist at the KOR. However, relative to <b>buprenorphine,</b> norbuprenorphine has extremely little antinociceptive potency (1/50th that of <b>buprenorphine),</b> but markedly depresses respiration (10-fold more than <b>buprenorphine).</b> This {{can be explained by}} very poor brain penetration of norbuprenorphine due to a high affinity of the compound for P-glycoprotein. In contrast to norbuprenorphine, <b>buprenorphine</b> and its glucuronide metabolites are negligibly transported by P-glycoprotein.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>buprenorphine</b> and {{methadone}} are medications {{used for}} detoxification, short- and long-term opioid replacement therapy. <b>Buprenorphine</b> {{has the advantage}} of being only a partial agonist; hence negating the potential for life-threatening respiratory depression in cases of abuse. Studies show the effectiveness of <b>buprenorphine</b> and methadone are almost identical, and largely share adverse-effect profiles apart from more sedation among methadone users. At low flexible doses from 2 to 6mg, however, <b>buprenorphine</b> has a lower retention rate than from low doses 40mg or less of methadone.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, <b>buprenorphine</b> (Subutex) and <b>buprenorphine</b> with {{naloxone}} (Suboxone) {{were approved}} for opioid addiction by the United States Food and Drug Administration in October 2002. The FDA rescheduled <b>buprenorphine</b> from a Schedule V drug to a Schedule III drug just before approval of Subutex and Suboxone. The ACSCN for <b>buprenorphine</b> is 9064, {{and being a}} Schedule III substance {{it does not have}} an annual manufacturing quota imposed by the DEA. The salt in use is the hydrochloride, which has a free base conversion ratio of 0.928.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>buprenorphine</b> is {{a partial}} agonist of the MOR, human {{studies have found}} that it acts like a full agonist with respect to analgesia. Conversely, <b>buprenorphine</b> behaves like a partial agonist of the MOR with respect to {{respiratory}} depression.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> behaves {{differently}} than other opioids in this respect, as {{it shows a}} ceiling effect for respiratory depression. Moreover, doubts about the antagonisation of the respiratory effects by naloxone have been disproved: <b>Buprenorphine</b> effects can be antagonised with a continuous infusion of naloxone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> is metabolised by the liver, via CYP3A4 (also CYP2C8 {{seems to}} be involved) {{isozymes}} of the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, into norbuprenorphine (by N-dealkylation). The glucuronidation of <b>buprenorphine</b> is primarily carried out by UGT1A1 and UGT2B7, and that of norbuprenorphine by UGT1A1 and UGT1A3. These glucuronides are then eliminated mainly through excretion into the bile. The elimination half-life of <b>buprenorphine</b> is 20–73 hours (mean 37). Due to the mainly hepatic elimination, there is no risk of accumulation in people with renal impairment.|$|E
25|$|In {{combination}} with samidorphan or naltrexone (μ-opioid receptor antagonists), <b>buprenorphine</b> {{is under investigation}} {{for the treatment of}} cocaine dependence, and recently demonstrated effectiveness for this indication in a large-scale (n = 302) clinical trial (at a high <b>buprenorphine</b> dose of 16mg but not a low dose of 4mg).|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> {{treatment}} {{carries the}} risk of causing psychological or physical dependence. <b>Buprenorphine</b> has a slow onset, has a mild effect, and is very long acting with a half-life of 24 to 60 hours. Once a patient has stabilized on the drug, there are two treatment options: continual use/maintenance, or medically supervised withdrawal from the physical dependence to the drug.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> was {{approved}} {{for medical use}} in the United States in 1981.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> is {{also known}} to bind to with high {{affinity}} and antagonize the putative ε-opioid receptor.|$|E
25|$|Full {{analgesic}} {{efficacy of}} <b>buprenorphine</b> requires both exon 11- and exon 1-associated μ-opioid receptor splice variants.|$|E
25|$|It is also {{difficult}} to achieve acute opioid analgesia in persons using <b>buprenorphine</b> for opioid replacement therapy.|$|E
25|$|The active {{metabolites}} of <b>buprenorphine</b> are {{not thought}} to be clinically important in its central nervous system effects.|$|E
25|$|In one study, <b>buprenorphine</b> {{was found}} to be {{effective}} in a subset of individuals with treatment-refractory obsessive–compulsive disorder.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> also blocks {{voltage-gated}} sodium channels via {{the local}} anesthetic binding site, and this underlies its potent local anesthetic properties.|$|E
25|$|People on {{high-dose}} <b>buprenorphine</b> therapy may be {{unaffected by}} even large doses of opioids such as oxycodone, morphine, or hydromorphone.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{some other}} opioids and opioid antagonists, <b>buprenorphine</b> binds only weakly to and {{possesses}} {{little if any}} activity at the sigma receptor.|$|E
25|$|Nociceptin {{receptor}} (NOP, ORL-1): Weak affinity. Very weak partial agonist. May {{be involved}} in lack of respiratory depression with <b>buprenorphine</b> in overdose.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> {{has been}} {{introduced}} in most European countries as a transdermal formulation (marketed as Transtec) {{for the treatment of}} chronic pain not responding to non-opioids.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> is a semi-synthetic {{analogue}} of thebaine and {{is fairly}} soluble in water, as its hydrochloride salt. It degrades {{in the presence}} of light.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{to various}} other opioids, <b>buprenorphine</b> {{has also been}} found {{to act as an}} agonist of the {{toll-like}} receptor 4, albeit with very low affinity.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{have been approved}} {{for the treatment of}} substance abuse. These include replacement therapies such as <b>buprenorphine</b> and methadone as well as antagonist medications like disulfiram and naltrexone in either short acting, or the newer long acting form. Several other medications, often ones originally used in other contexts, have also been shown to be effective including bupropion and modafinil. Methadone and <b>buprenorphine</b> are sometimes used to treat opiate addiction. These drugs are used as substitutes for other opioids and still cause withdrawal symptoms.|$|E
25|$|Morphine is also {{available}} as a slow-release formulation for opiate substitution therapy (OST) in Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovenia, for addicts who cannot tolerate either methadone or <b>buprenorphine.</b>|$|E
25|$|The glucuronides of <b>buprenorphine</b> and norbuprenorphine {{are also}} biologically active, and {{represent}} major active metabolites of <b>buprenorphine.</b> Buprenorphine-3-glucuronide has {{affinity for the}} MOR (Ki = 4.9 pM), DOR (Ki = 270 nM) and ORL-1 (Ki = 36 µM), and no affinity for the KOR. It has a small antinociceptive effect and no effect on respiration. Norbuprenorphine-3-glucuronide has no affinity for the MOR or DOR, but does bind to the KOR (Ki = 300 nM) and ORL-1 (Ki = 18 µM). It has a sedative effect but no effect on respiration.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine,</b> {{sold under}} {{the brand name}} Subutex, among others, is an opioid used to treat opioid addiction, {{moderate}} acute pain and moderate chronic pain. The combination buprenorphine/naloxone is also used for opioid addiction.|$|E
25|$|Buprenorphine/samidorphan (ALKS-5461), a {{combination}} product of <b>buprenorphine</b> and samidorphan (a preferential μ-opioid receptor antagonist), is currently undergoing phase III clinical trials in the United States for augmentation of antidepressant therapy for treatment-resistant depression.|$|E
25|$|Concurrent use of <b>buprenorphine</b> {{with other}} CNS {{depressants}} (such as alcohol or benzodiazepines) is contraindicated {{as it may}} lead to fatal respiratory depression. Benzodiazepines, in recommended doses, are not contraindicated in individuals tolerant to either opioids or benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|<b>Buprenorphine</b> is {{available}} under the trade names Cizdol, Suboxone, Subutex (typically used for opioid addiction), Temgesic (sublingual tablets for {{moderate to severe}} pain), Buprenex (solutions for injection often used for acute pain in primary-care settings), Norspan and Butrans (transdermal preparations used for chronic pain).|$|E
25|$|In the European Union, Subutex and Suboxone, buprenorphine's {{high-dose}} {{sublingual tablet}} preparations, were approved for opioid addiction treatment in September 2006. In the Netherlands, <b>buprenorphine</b> is a List II drug of the Opium Law, though special rules and guidelines apply to its prescription and dispensation.|$|E
25|$|In {{simplified}} terms, <b>buprenorphine</b> can essentially {{be thought}} of as a non-selective, mixed agonist–antagonist opioid receptor modulator, acting as a weak partial agonist of the MOR, an antagonist of the KOR, an antagonist of the DOR, and a relatively low-affinity, very weak partial agonist of the ORL-1.|$|E
25|$|A {{clinical}} trial conducted at Harvard Medical School {{in the mid-1990s}} demonstrated {{that a majority of}} persons with non‑psychotic unipolar depression who were refractory to conventional antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy could be successfully treated with <b>buprenorphine.</b> Clinical depression is currently not an approved indication for the use of any opioid.|$|E
25|$|For {{individuals}} {{addicted to}} prescription drugs, treatments {{tend to be}} similar to those who are addicted to drugs affecting the same brain systems. Medication like methadone and <b>buprenorphine</b> can be used to treat addiction to prescription opiates, and behavioral therapies can be used to treat addiction to prescription stimulants, benzodiazepines, and other drugs.|$|E
25|$|In European {{nations such}} as Austria, Bulgaria, and Slovakia, slow release oral {{morphine}} formulations are used in opiate substitution therapy (OST) for patients who do not well tolerate {{the side effects of}} <b>buprenorphine</b> or methadone. In other European countries including the UK, this is also legally used for OST although on a varying scale of acceptance.|$|E
